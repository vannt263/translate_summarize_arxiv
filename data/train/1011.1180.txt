    "a growing number of radio pulsars have now been observed for over a decade ( some for more than 30 years ) and are , in general , very stable rotators .",
    "however , many pulsars also exhibit timing irregularities , such as `` glitches '' , which are sudden increases in the rotation rate , and `` timing noise '' , a general term which refers to low frequency quasi - periodic structures that appear in the timing residuals , once the `` regularly '' pulsating solution has been removed .",
    "in particular , while the irregularities in younger pulsars are dominated by the recovery from glitch events , for a handful of older pulsars there is growing evidence for long - period ( @xmath0 100 - 1000 days ) oscillations in the timing residuals @xcite . in some cases",
    "these periodicities , and the correlated pulse shape changes , can be partially explained by neutron star free - precession , and one of the best examples of this is psr b1828 - 11 which shows significant periodicity at @xmath1 days and @xmath2 days @xcite .",
    "however there are theoretical arguments stating that mutual friction between the interior superfluid components of the star would damp out any precessional motion on a short timescale @xcite ( although glampedakis et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that short wave length instabilities in the pinned superfluid could cast an element of doubt on such conclusions ) .",
    "furthermore recent work shows that some pulsars may be switching abruptly between two different states with different spin - down rates , thus giving rise to the observed timing behaviour @xcite .",
    "noronha and sedrakian @xcite , following earlier suggestions by ruderman @xcite , indicated that an alternative explanation for the observed long term periodicity could be the propagation of tkachenko waves in the star .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested that tkachenko waves excited by glitches may be driving precession in one of the x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ) , rx j0720.4 - 3125 @xcite .",
    "neutron star interiors are expected to contain charge neutral superfluids that rotate by forming an array of quantized vortices . in their lowest energy state",
    "the vortices form a two - dimensional triangular lattice that can support elastic oscillations , tkachenko waves @xcite , that have been studied extensively , both theoretically and experimentally , in superfluid @xmath3he ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) and recently in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the undamped propagation of tkachenko waves in a neutron star would lead to periodic variations in the angular momentum of the superfluid which , due to coupling to the crust , would lead to variations in the observed rotation rate . in order to ascertain if this is a viable hypothesis it is crucial to understand how the detailed microphysics of neutron star interiors affects the propagation of the modes .",
    "most studies to date have been based on the hydrodynamical theory of tkachenko waves developed by baym and chandler @xcite for superfluid @xmath3he . in this case",
    "the fluids can be treated , to a good degree of approximation , as incompressible , given that the rotation rate is always well below the sound wave frequency ( note , however , that in becs , compressibility has a strong effect , due to the interactions being much weaker and the sound speed much lower than in helium ) , and the system can be described as a condensate ( the `` superfluid '' ) coupled to a `` normal '' fluid which consists , loosely speaking , of the thermal excitations of the system .    in a realistic neutron star ,",
    "on the other hand , one must take into account not only the effects of rapid rotation , but also the presence of several massive fluids , describing the flow of electrons , protons , superfluid neutrons ( and their excitations at finite temperature ) and possibly exotic particles such as hyperons or deconfined quarks , which can not , in general , be assumed to be incompressible .",
    "furthermore , one must consider various dissipative processes that damp out the oscillations .",
    "it is well known that in a multifluid system there will , in general , be many more dissipation channels than in a simple one - fluid flow described by the navier - stokes equation @xcite .",
    "solving the full problem is clearly a daunting task , so in this paper we shall make a series of simplifying assumptions .",
    "we take a system of two fluids : the superfluid neutrons and a charged component of protons and electrons , which are locked by the coulomb interaction on a much shorter timescale than the dynamical timescales considered here .",
    "this assumption is justified as the frequencies of the modes we calculate ( tkachenko waves , sound waves and inertial waves ) are always significantly lower than the electron - proton cyclotron and plasma frequencies , i.e. lower than @xmath4 hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "both fluids are assumed to be compressible , and we shall assume some simplified analytic models for the equation of state , derived from haskell et al .",
    "furthermore we will only consider the damping due to superfluid mutual friction , which has been found to have a significant effect on the mode propagation @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "in section ii we present the formalism for studying the oscillations of a two - fluid neutron star with mutual friction and vortex lattice elasticity . in section iii",
    "we perform a plane wave analysis of the oscillation spectrum in the incompressible case and in section iv we present the more realistic compressible case .",
    "as we shall see compressibility and chemical coupling between the components can profoundly alter the nature of the tkachenko waves , leading in some cases to much shorter periods of oscillation , close to the rotation period of the star , which are not consistent with the observed periodicities in pulsar timing residuals . finally in section",
    "v we outline our conclusions .",
    "our starting points will be the multi - fluid formulation of superfluid hydrodynamics of andersson and comer @xcite , and the baym - chandler formalism for including the effects of vortex lattice elasticity in the study of superfluid @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "let us consider a two fluid system of neutrons and protons ( which we assume locked to the electrons @xcite ) and write the euler equations for the neutrons , in a frame rotating with the star at fixed angular velocity @xmath5 and in the absence of external forces and mutual friction .",
    "following @xcite this takes the form : ( _ t + v^_j^j)(v^_i+_w^_i)+2_ijk^j v_^k + _ i ( _ + ) + _",
    "w^j__i v^_j = 0[eulern ] where @xmath6 is the neutron velocity , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the proton velocity , @xmath9 is the entrainment parameter for the neutrons @xcite , @xmath10 is the chemical potential per unit mass of the neutrons and @xmath11 is the gravitational potential .",
    "note that we assume summation of repeated indices and assume the neutron and proton masses equal , @xmath12 . in the above equation we have not yet imposed that the neutrons be superfluid . to do this",
    "we must require that the fluid rotates by forming an array of singly quantized vortices , and that averaging over a large number of such vortices gives rise to the macroscopic vorticity @xmath13 of the fluid via the relation : ^i = n_v^i = ^ijk_j ( v^_k+^w^_k ) [ circolo ] where @xmath14 is a unit vector along the direction of the vortex array , @xmath15 @xmath16 s@xmath17 is the quantum of circulation and @xmath18 is the number of vortices threading a unit surface .",
    "it is important to remark here that the quantization condition on the circulation is a condition on the momentum of the neutron fluid @xmath19 , and not on its velocity @xmath20 ( which will not in general be aligned with @xmath21 due to the entrainment ) . from equation ( [ circolo ] )",
    "one can derive the equation of motion for the circulation _",
    "t _ i+_ijk^klm^j _",
    "l v^_m=0[circolo1 ] and a conservation equation for the vortex number _",
    "( n_v^i _ ) = 0[circolo2 ] with @xmath22 the macroscopically averaged vortex velocity .",
    "it is possible to show ( @xcite ) that , in order for equations ( [ circolo1 ] ) and ( [ circolo2 ] ) to be staisfied it is necessary to add a `` magnus force '' term to the right hand side of equation ( [ eulern ] ) , which thus takes the form ( _ t + v^_j^j)(v^_i+_w^_i)+2_ijk^j v_^k + _ i ( _ + ) + _ n w^j__i v^_j = n_v_ijk ^j ( v_^k - v_v^k)[eulern2 ] it is clear from equation ( [ eulern2 ] ) that in the absence of other forces the vortices will be forced to move with the superfluid neutron condensate .",
    "the presence of vortices will , however , also affect the proton fluid , which will experience a drag force of the form @xmath23 , where the exact nature of the process giving rise to the drag is encoded in the dimensionelss parameter @xmath24 . in a neutron star",
    "there are , in fact , a variety of mechanisms that can produce a dissipative drag : scattering of electrons off vortex cores is likely to be the dominant process in the core @xcite , while in the crust the main contribution is due to interactions with the lattice phonons @xcite and the excitation of vortex kelvin waves @xcite .",
    "the diverse nature of these processes leads to the drag parameter spanning several orders of magnitude in the different regions of a neutron star interior ( from as low as @xmath25 to @xmath26 ) .",
    "we shall thus treat @xmath27 as a free parameter and investigate how its variations affect the modes .",
    "the euler equations for the proton fluid take the form : ( _ t + v^_j^j)(v^_i-_w^_i)+2_ijk^j v_^k + _ i ( _ + ) + _",
    "w^j__i v^_j = n_v ( v^_i - v^_i)[eulerp ] where @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are now the chemical potential per unit mass and entrainment parameter of the protons , such that @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we also need an equation of motion for the vortex lines which , if we assume that they have negligible inertia , takes the form of a force balance between the magnus force , the drag force and the elastic force exerted by the lattice @xcite : _ n_v_ijk^j ( v_v^k - v_^k)+_n_v(v^_i - v^_i)-__i=0[forcev ] where @xmath32 represents the contribution due to lattice elasticity and takes the form : _",
    "i = where @xmath33 is the displacement of the vortex line from its equilibrium position , @xmath34 is the gradient perpendicular to the direction of the array and @xmath35 is the shear modulus of a triangular vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "note that the above expression only describes the linear order corrections in the lattice displacements , which are assumed to be small .",
    "furthermore we are neglecting the contribution of vortex bending , which would give rise to kelvin waves propagating along the vortex lines .",
    "note that this could be accounted for by including a vortex `` tension '' term in @xmath32 , which we denote @xmath36 , of the form : ^t_i=- ( ) where @xmath37 is the vortex core radius , @xmath38 is the inter - vortex spacing for a triangular lattice and the @xmath39 axis is taken along the rotation axis of the star .",
    "the continuity equations for neutrons and protons take the form & & _ t _ + ^i(_v^_i)=0 + & & _ t _ + ^i(_v^_i)=0 and",
    "the gravitational potential obeys the poisson equation ^2 = 4 g ( _ + _ ) where @xmath40 is the gravitational constant . finally to solve the problem we need to supply an equation of state for the system . as we shall examine different cases we delay the discussion of the equation of state to the following sections and move on to discussing perturbations of the multi - fluid equations of motion presented above .      in order to keep the problem tractable",
    "we shall consider linear perturbations of a background in which the two fluids rotate together with uniform angular velocity @xmath5 .",
    "for such a background equation ( [ circolo ] ) takes the form : n_=2and the perturbed euler equations can be written , in a frame co - rotating with the star , as : & & _ t ( v_i^+ _ w_i^ ) + 2_ijk ^j v_^k + _ i _ = -2 ( v^_i - v^_i)-_i + & & _ t ( v_i^- _ w_i^ ) + 2_ijk ^j v_^k + _ i _ = 2 ( v^_i - v^_i)[eulers ] where we have made the cowling approximation , i.e. neglected the perturbations of the gravitational potential @xmath41 . note that as a consequence of the extra elastic term in the force balance equation for the vortices ( [ balo ] ) , the forces on the right hand side of the euler equations are no longer symmetric and the vortex elasticity term only acts on the neutron superfluid .",
    "the elastic force @xmath32 can be written as _",
    "i = c_t^2where we have defined the tkachenko wave speed @xmath42 and are assuming the vortices to be in equilibrium in the background , such that @xmath43 .",
    "we assume all vortex displacements to be perturbed quantities , and write @xmath33 in place of @xmath44 , unless otherwise specified , and thus consider @xmath32 to also be a perturbed quantity .",
    "as we are dealing with linearised elasticity and the displacement vectors @xmath33 it would be natural to consider lagrangian perturbations of the two - fluid equations of motion , given that in general one would have that @xmath45 .",
    "however , given that we are working in a rotating frame , and have assumed that the fluids ( and thus the vortices ) are moving together in the background , one has that @xmath46",
    ". we can thus continue to work with eulerian perturbations , which simplifies somewhat the problem .",
    "the equation of force balance for the vortices ( [ forcev ] ) can be cast in the form : v_i^=v_i^+_ijk^j w^k_-_i+(w_j^^j)-- [ balo]and the perturbed continuity equations , in the absence of reactions , take the form & & _ t _ + ^i(_v^_i)=0 + & & _ t",

    "finally the vortex elasticity contribution takes the form : = = ( -(c_t k)^2,(c_t k)^2,0 ) in order to obtain the dispersion relation for the modes of the system we thus need to solve the characteristic equation det@xmath66=0 , where @xmath67 follows from equations ( [ eulersk1]-[eulersk ] ) and is given in equation ( [ kappa1 ] ) .    in the undamped case , neglecting the effect of entrainment ( @xmath68 ) one obtains , as expected , two families of modes , the inertial modes ^2=4 ^ 2 ( ) ^2 and the tkachenko waves ^2=4 ^ 2()^2+c_t^2 k^2()^4-()^44 ^ 2||^2+c_t^2 k^2()^4 [ mod1]where we are assuming that @xmath69",

    "we now consider the dissipative terms due to mutual friction , i.e. to the drag parameter @xmath24 . in order to keep the results tractable",
    "we take @xmath68 .",
    "it is still however impractical to consider the whole solution , so let us first of all consider modes propagating along the @xmath39 axis ( @xmath76 )",
    ". in this case one has two families of inertial modes , one which is undamped with dispersion relation = 2[inertia1 ] and one which is affected by mutual friction : = 2^-i2 [ inertia2 ] where we remind the reader that @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] . the results in ( [ inertia1 ] ) and ( [ inertia2 ] ) agree well with those of @xcite , in which the authors show that there is one class of inertial modes that corresponds to the fluids co - moving and is undamped ( in the absence of chemical coupling ) and another class of counter - moving modes that is rapidly damped by mutual friction .",
    "let us now examine the case of tkachenko waves propagating perpendicular to the rotation axis ( @xmath72 ) . in figure [ res1 ]",
    "we plot the frequency of the modes for @xmath79 and @xmath80 hz , as a function of @xmath24 in the weak drag regime . for large values of the proton fraction",
    "@xmath81 we recover the solution of @xcite , in which the real part of the frequency vanishes and the damping becomes large for values of the drag parameter such that the mutual friction damping timescale @xmath82 is approximately equal to the the tkachenko wave period @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "in fact close to this value the mode has an extra purely imaginary root , as found by @xcite . for more realistic values of the proton fraction",
    "we see , however , that the pathological behaviour disappears and even though the damping is stronger when the mutual friction timescale is close to the period of the modes , the real part does not vanish , the mode is always oscillatory , and there are always only two purely imaginary roots .    = 0.96 and @xmath81=0.1 .",
    "we take @xmath79 . for @xmath85",
    "we recover the results of @xcite : the real part of the mode vanishes when the mutual friction damping timescale is close to the mode period , and there is an extra purely imaginary root . for",
    "the more realistic , but still large , value of @xmath81=0.1 we see that , on the other hand , the mode is always oscillatory , although the imaginary part is larger when the damping timescale and mode period are similar . for higher values of the drag the frequency of the mode is reduced to @xmath86 of the original value.,title=\"fig:\",height=207]=0.96 and @xmath81=0.1 .",

    "however it is commonly believed that vortex lines can interact strongly with lattice points in the neutron star crust and pin to them , in such a way that they are forced to move with the charged components of the star @xcite .",
    "the nature of such a pinning force is well beyond the scope of this paper , but to study the propagation of tkachenko waves in this scenario it is sufficient to consider an unspecified force @xmath87 acting on the vortices such that they are forced to move with the proton fluid , i.e. such that v_v^i = v_^i [ velo ] in this case the equation of force balance for vortices takes the form : _",
    "n_v_ijk^j(v_^k - v_^k)-_+f^=0[pinnedv ] where there is no drag force acting , as the vortex lines flow with the protons .",
    "if we now consider the neutron and proton fluid there will be a reaction force @xmath88 acting on a the protons and the magnus force acting on the neutrons . making use of equation ( [ pinnedv ] )",
    "we can thus cast the euler equations in the form : & & _ t ( v_i^+ _ w_i^ ) + 2_ijk ^j v_^k + _ i _ = -2_ijk ^j(v_^k - v_^k ) + & & _ t ( v_i^- _ w_i^ ) + 2_ijk ^j v_^k + _ i _",

    "this resembles the situation in superfluid @xmath3he , in which even a small amount of pinning swamps the contribution due to lattice elasticity and transforms the tkachenko waves into inertial waves @xcite .",
    "it is well known from the study of superfluid @xmath3he that compressibility can have a drastic effect on the mode structure @xcite .",
    "including compressibility in the equations of motion for the superfluid leads to a dispersion relation of the form @xcite : ^2= where @xmath89 is the sound speed . in the long wavelength limit ( @xmath90 ) the nature of the mode is thus profoundly altered and the dispersion relation is no longer linear in @xmath91 , but rather parabolic , leading to the so - called `` soft '' tkachenko wave frequency : k^2 in the study of @xmath3he the long wavelength limit is , however , mainly of theoretical interest , as one would need containers of several hundreds of meters in diameter to explore it experimentally .",
    "the situation is very different for becs as , in contrast with a strongly interacting bose liquid such as @xmath3he , they are weakly interacting bose gases with low sound speeds for which the effect of compressibility is important at high rotation rates . for becs",
    "the compressible tkachenko wave spectrum has thus been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a realistic neutron star .",
    "the situation is clearly quite complex as not only can we be in the long wavelength limit ( @xmath92 ) for the more rapidly rotating pulsars , but one also has to account for multi - fluid effects and chemical coupling between the different constituents via the equation of state .",
    "one can not , in general , assume incompressibility for the proton and neutron fluids and it is clearly of great interest to adapt our formalism to include the effects of compressibility and chemical coupling . to study this problem",
    "it is now advantageous to write the perturbation equations in the form of equations ( [ tutto1])-([tutto3 ] ) . in the plane wave approximation",

    "however , not only is such an equation of state not currently available , but its use would also be beyond the scope of our simplified plane wave analysis . in order to keep the problem tractable",
    "we shall assume that our background model is described by an @xmath95 polytrope and use for the perturbations two simplified analytic equations of state , that are essentially extensions of a single - fluid @xmath95 polytrope .",

    "this model , which we refer to as model b , is essentially a re - parametrisation of the model ii equation of state in @xcite ( also used in @xcite where it is denoted as model b0 ) and takes the form :    & & ( ) = c_s^2,()= + & & ( ) = , ( ) = we can thus study the behaviour of the solutions to are problem as we vary the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "clearly model a corresponds to the case @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the sound speed in the background , for an @xmath95 polytrope , takes the form c_s=2k where @xmath100 depends only on the stellar radius .",
    "however in our plane wave approximation we shall assume that the background quantities vary over a length - scale greater than that of the oscillations , and thus take them to be constant and neglect their gradients .",
    "this approximation is not necessarily justified , as in the crust the density and pressure vary by several orders of magnitude over a length - scale of approximately 1 km , which is comparable with the longest wavelengths we consider for our tkachenko waves .",
    "it is , however , a reasonable approximation for shorter wavelengths and in the neutron star core . the sound speed will thus be a constant in our formulation and",
    "specifically we take @xmath101 cm s@xmath17 .",
    "we also take the proton fraction , which in a rigorous description should also be derived from the equation of state , as a constant and will study the effect that varying it can have on the modes .",
    "needless to say , future work should aim to relax this approximation and consider a fully stratified neutron star .",
    "finally let us remark that for simplicity we take @xmath102 in the following discussion .",
    "we have experimented with varying the parameter @xmath103 between -0.8 and 0.8 , but it is found to have very little effect on the dispersion relation .",
    "let us consider , first of all , the undamped propagation of waves in a neutron star .",
    "we thus take @xmath104 and , to keep the problem tractable , @xmath102 , and solve the characteristic equation obtained form the determinant of the matrix @xmath67 given in ( [ ap3 ] ) . as a first step we focus on model a. the results are two families of modes , such that : ^2&=&4 ^ 2- [ cacio1 ] + ^2&=&(4 ^ 2 + k^2 c_s^2)+ as we can see we obtain sound waves and rotationally corrected tkachenko waves , for which the main contribution to the frequency is now given by the stellar rotation frequency .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , as in this limit the classical tkachenko waves no longer exist and the vortex elasticity simply provides a small correction to what is , in essence , the frequency of an inertial wave . in this case , for a pulsar rotating at @xmath105hz , the frequency of the tkachenko waves would be much too high to explain the observed periodicities of @xmath106 days observed in the timing residuals .",
    "such a drastic modification in the dispersion relation clearly needs to be investigated in more detail .",
    "we have , after all , used a simplified version of the equation of state , so let us turn our attention to model b in order to understand how varying the parameters ( and thus the coupling between the components ) can affect the mode structure and whether there is a reasonable set of parameters for which one can still obtain the usual tkachenko waves .",
    "in the case of model b the extra parameters make it necessary to solve the characteristic equation numerically , but they also allow us extra freedom to explore different regimes for the equation of state .",
    "first of all let us eliminate all chemical coupling by setting @xmath107 .",
    "in figure [ variob ] we plot the mode frequency for varying @xmath97 at different rotation rates .",
    "we see that in this case there is a mode with the frequency of the classical tkachenko mode and furthermore varying @xmath97 has very little effect on its frequency .",
    "if we now keep @xmath97 fixed and vary the rotation rate of the star we see in figure [ varioom ] that for low rotation rates the frequency of the tkachenko mode is the classical one . for higher rotation rates the classical frequency increases but the frequency of the tkachenko mode tends to that of the so called `` soft '' tkachenko mode @xmath108 .",
    "the result is thus that , for longer wave - length of order the stellar radius , there is always a tkachenko mode with periods consistent with the @xmath109 day variability typical of pulsar timing noise .",
    "this picture is clearly very different from that of the previous section , in which the tkachenko waves had essentially disappeared , so let us investigate how re - instating the chemical coupling and varying the parameter @xmath96 can affect the mode structure .    , whilst keeping @xmath107 .",

    "the real part of frequency of the tkachenko wave , on the other hand , vanishes after the avoided crossing and one obtains two purely imaginary roots .",

    "<S> long wavelength oscillations ( tkachenko waves ) of the triangular lattice of quantized vortices in superfluid neutron stars have been suggested as one of the possible explanations for the timing noise observed in many radio pulsars , in particular for the 100 - 1000 day variations in the spin of psr 1828 - 11 . </S>",
    "<S> most studies to date have , however , been based on the hydrodynamics developed for superfluid helium . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend the formulation to a two fluid neutron and proton system , relevant for neutron star interiors and include the effect of chemical coupling , compressibility and mutual friction between the components . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we find that chemical coupling and compressibility can have a drastic effect on the mode structure . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the slower pulsars rotating at 1 - 10 hz ( such as psr b1828 - 11 ) , most choices of parameters in the equation of state lead to tkachenko oscillations with frequencies in the correct range to explain the timing noise . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the case of more rapidly rotating pulsars ( above 100 hz ) for which we find that there is a vast portion of parameter space in which there are no tkachenko modes , but only modified sound waves at much higher frequencies .    </S>",
