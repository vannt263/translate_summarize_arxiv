    "in the previous papers of this series , we constructed a numerical scheme to simulate the anticipated mass and semimajor axis ( @xmath2 ) distribution of planets based on a comprehensive treatment of the sequential planet formation scenario . in the scheme ,",
    "we first generate a set of protoplanetary disk models with various surface densities and depletion timescales , on the basis of radio observations . for each disk",
    ", we randomly select semimajor axes of the protoplanetary seeds and integrate the growth of the protoplanets due to planetesimal accretion , assuming that planetesimals have been already formed from dust grains in the disks .",
    "if their masses become large enough , gas accretion onto the planets is also added .",
    "the planets orbits evolve through type i and type ii migrations .",
    "we integrate growth and orbital evolution of planets independently , neglecting dynamical interactions between planets ( see discussion in  3.3 ) . for the integration",
    ", we use the semi - analytical prescriptions based on detailed numerical simulations . for details , see  3.3 , papers i and iv . in paper",
    "i , we presented calculations for solar - type stars by neglecting the effect of type i migration on the basis that its efficiency is poorly determined . with the same assumptions , we simulated the @xmath2 distribution for stars with a range of metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) and mass ( @xmath3 ) in papers ii and iii , respectively .",
    "as a consequence of their tidal interactions with surrounding disk gas , embedded embryos more massive than mars migrate towards their host stars @xcite . in paper iv , we have considered the influence of this type i migration on the planet formation process .",
    "our results indicate that when this effect is fully taken into account , the icy cores have a tendency to migrate into their host stars before they acquire adequate mass to initiate efficient gas accretion . in order to preserve a sufficient fraction of cores which can subsequently evolve into the observed population of gas giants around solar type stars",
    ", we introduced a `` type i migration reduction factor '' @xmath4 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath4 smaller than unity lengthens the actual magnitude of the type i migration timescale relative to that deduced from linear theories ( paper iv ; also see the results in  3.3 and 3.4 ) . with a range of small @xmath5 , we were able to simulate a planetary @xmath2 distribution which is qualitatively consistent with that observed by radial velocity survey .",
    "while several suppression mechanisms for type i migration under various circumstances have been suggested ( see references in paper iv ) , the extremely small values of @xmath4 we have adopted in our previous models remains a challenge to our theoretical construct .",
    "in addition , there remain some quantitative discrepancies between the results of our population synthesis and the observed @xmath6 distribution of extrasolar planets . around solar - type stars ,",
    "existing data show an steep up turn in the frequency of detected planets with period around 1 - 4 yrs ( corresponding to @xmath6 in the range of 1 - 3 au ) @xcite whereas the predicted @xmath6 distribution from our past models is essentially logarithmic ( see the results in  3.3 ) .",
    "another minor issue concerns with the availability of the building - block material for gas giants cores .",
    "current theory of gas giant formation requires a critical mass ( @xmath7 ) in excess of several earth masses in order for the onset of efficient gas accretion ( e.g. , paper iv ) .",
    "but , the growth of embryos is limited by an isolation mass @xmath8 . for the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model",
    ", the surface density distribution of the solid material @xmath9 implies @xmath8 is an increasing function of the semimajor axis @xmath6 .",
    "the growth timescale for the embryos @xmath10 also increases with @xmath6 . on the gas depletion timescale @xmath11 ,",
    "the most massive embryos emerge near the ice line of a disk comparable to mmsn with a mass @xmath12 ( paper i ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath13 and the embryos characteristic growth time scale is @xmath14 @xcite . in principle",
    ", @xmath8 can exceed @xmath7 in disks which are everywhere several times larger than the mmsn @xcite .",
    "but , the low efficiency of converting these building block material into embryos and few giant planets becomes a new issue .",
    "the retention of a large amount of heavy elements throughout the disk may also lead to noticeable metallicity dispersion among stars within any given stellar cluster , contrary to its observed upper limit @xcite .    in order to resolve the issues of @xmath2 distribution and the adequacy of planet - building blocks",
    ", we consider an additional effect through which grains and planetary embryos may be trapped in some special location in the disk .",
    "this effect is associated with an intrinsic local pressure maximum in the disk which induces the gas to attain a super - keplerian azimuthal speed .",
    "the hydrodynamic drag by the gas on the grains causes them to stall and become trapped near the ice line @xcite . in  2.1 , we describe this grain trapping process and show how it may lead to the local ( rather than global ) enhancement of @xmath15 near the ice line such that the formation of gas giants is possible in disks similar to the mmsn .    in paper iv",
    ", we showed that the formation probability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajor axis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by the strength of type i migration . here",
    "we show that the structure of the disk near the ice line can also locally stall the type i migration of the embryos . in  2.2 ,",
    "we show that the modification of the azimuthal speed of the disk gas near the ice line provides another effective mechanism for the retention and rapid accumulation of embryos . in  3 , we incorporate this effect into our numerical scheme and simulate the mass - semimajor axis distribution of gas giant planets around solar - type stars . in  4 , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "gas giant planets form in protoplanetary disks prior to the gas depletion .",
    "the first step in this process is the condensation , growth , and retention of grains . in most regions of the disk , a negative pressure gradient in the radial direction reduces the azimuthal speed of the gas below the keplerian value , so the grains undergo orbital decay ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath16",
    "au in a mmsn , the meter - size particles migrate into the sun within a few centuries .",
    "particles can grow faster than their orbital decay provided the local @xmath15 is larger than the surface density of gas @xmath17 @xcite . under these conditions and in the absence of turbulence in the disk , the grains may also settle into a thin layer and become gravitationally unstable @xcite .",
    "however , kelvin - helmholtz instability caused by velocity difference between dust - rich and dust - poor layers @xcite and intrinsic turbulence such as magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite may prevent the concentration of dust grains . the main challenge in this scenario is how to enhance a local concentration of dust grains @xcite .",
    "if the orbital decay of icy grains due to gas drag is terminated locally near the ice line , they would be concentrated near the ice line at orbital radius @xmath18 ( eq .  [ [ eq : a_ice ] ] ) .",
    "one possible mechanism to terminate their decay is through sublimation of icy dust grains and viscous diffusion of the water vapors across the ice line @xcite . across @xmath18",
    ", an equilibrium may be established in which the outward diffusion of water molecules and their recondensation into grains is balanced by the inward orbital decay of the solid particles .",
    "the exchange of latent heat associated with these phase transition significantly reduces the local temperature gradient ( kretke & lin , in preparation ) . here",
    ", we consider another possible mechanism to terminate the decay , positive radial gradient of disk gas due to change in activity of mri across @xmath18 .",
    "this mechanism also halts type i migration of planetary embryos and enhances formation and retention rates of gas giants .",
    "the magnitude of gas surface density @xmath17 is determined by the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the disk .",
    "a leading mechanism for angular momentum transfer in typical astrophysical disks is mri .",
    "however , near the mid plane at a few aus in protoplanetary disks , the gas may have a sufficiently low ionization fraction which quenches the mri .",
    "this region is commonly referred to as the `` dead zone '' @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the surface layers of these disks are exposed to the ionizing photons from the central host stars and nearby massive stars @xcite as well as cosmic rays .",
    "the ionization fraction @xmath19 in this layer is sufficient to provide an effective angular momentum transfer process which would allow an accretion flow with a flux @xmath20@xmath21 yr@xmath1 , which is inferred from observation of t tauri stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but , the magnitude of @xmath19 is determined by an ionization equilibrium which is determined by both the ionization and recombination rates .",
    "the main agents for removing electrons from the gas are grains @xcite .",
    "interior to @xmath18 , the sublimation of ices greatly reduces the effective cross section of the grain population from that outside @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the active layer is much more extended interior to @xmath18 than exterior to @xmath18 .",
    "the sublimation of ices at @xmath22 implies that the angular momentum transfer efficiency in the surface layers undergo a transition across @xmath18 @xcite . in regions of disks well interior to the radius of maximum couple @xcite , the disk flow ( @xmath23 ) rapidly adjusts to a state of quasi steady state",
    "in which @xmath23 is approximately independent of orbital radius @xmath24 . in principle",
    ", the structure of a mri - driven - turbulent disk requires multi - dimensional simulation , even in the limit of steady disk flow .",
    "such simulations are time consuming and are yet to be fully resolved @xcite . in the present context",
    ", the dominant effects on the disk structure can be illustrated with the standard _",

    "@xmath29 in regions where the surface layer is sufficiently ionized to be affected by the mri turbulence @xcite but the interior is essentially shielded and remains inactive ( or dead ) , we find it convenient to adopt a prescription by @xcite in which the effective magnitude of the @xmath25 parameter , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the gas surface density of the active layer and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are alpha parameters in mri active and dead zones . outside the ice line",
    ", the condensation of the grains significantly reduces the column density of the active layer .",
    "since @xmath34 , the effective magnitude of @xmath25 decreases as @xmath24 across the ice line . in a quasi steady state where @xmath23 is nearly constant of @xmath24 , @xmath35 so that @xmath17 can be enhanced significantly across the ice line .",
    "this positive gradient of @xmath17 can lead to a local pressure maximum .",
    "when the exponent of disk midplane pressure @xmath36 , defined by @xmath37 , is positive , the grains experience a tail wind and the hydrodynamic drag leads to their outward orbital expansion @xcite . for the equation of state of an ideal gas , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are mass density and temperature of the disk . since @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is keplerian frequency , positive @xmath43",
    "is realized when @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . for @xmath48 ,",
    "this condition is @xmath49 .",
    "a shallower surface density gradient is required if the release of the latent heat essentially suppresses the local temperature gradient .",
    "modification of the @xmath17 profile is confined to the ice line region .",
    "since the positive @xmath43 is local , dust grains accumulate near the outer edge of the positive @xmath43 region , which may lead to a large enhancement in @xmath15 near the ice line region @xcite .",
    "since the isolation core mass and the core s growth rate increases with @xmath15 , it is possible to build up sufficiently massive cores to start the runaway gas accretion process while the residual gas is depleted to surface densities comparable to that of the mmsn .",
    "another important consequence for the modification of the rotation law is the suppression of type i migration efficiency @xcite . even in the stage in which planet accretion from planetesimals proceeds , large amount of small dust grains may still float in the disk @xcite ,",
    "so embryos undergoing type i migration can also be trapped near the ice line @xcite .",
    "for type i migration , since curvature of the system also affects the locations of lindblad resonances , the condition for outward migration is slightly modulated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_r_grad ] ) .",
    "the migration rate of a planet with mass @xmath50 is given by @xcite @xmath51 this expression includes contributions from both lindblad and corotation resonances .",
    "the dependence on @xmath52 incorporates uncertainties associated with nonlinear effects .",
    "the condition for outward migration is @xmath53 , which is similar to that for gas drag migration ( eq .",

    ", this condition can be satisfied near the ice line .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the planetesimals is regulated by the surface density distribution of the gas in the disk . in principle",

    "however , we have not considered the aspect of non - steady nature of the flow which can lead to an outward type ii migration at large distances from the host stars .",
    "such an effect will be considered in the future .    similarly , for computational convenience ,",

    "we found that the retention efficiency of cores against type i migration is reduced only slightly and overall features of our results do not change , even if we use @xmath69 for @xmath66 in our simulation , because a barrier for migration is a more important effect of the ice line than the enhancement of @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the potential effect of @xmath17 variation ( due to changes in @xmath62 ) across the ice line . in principle , we should take into account any possible accumulation of the trapped grains near the ice line prior to this seemingly arbitrary initial state .",
    "however , the local pressure maximum in the @xmath17 distribution appears only after the gas accretion rate in the disk has declined below a critical value .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sigma_dust ] ) corresponds to the surface density of the grains when this barrier at the ice line first appears .",

    "these results are essentially the same as those in paper iv , except that in our previous simulations , we adopted @xmath129 without any dispersion . in the absence of any ice line barrier , only for @xmath130 ( _ i.e. _ in the inefficient type i migration limit ) ,",
    "the predicted population of gas giants matches well with the observed data ( see below ) . in models with higher values of @xmath131",
    ", only the low - mass ( @xmath132 ) cores can survive the type i migration .",
    "these low - mass cores can not evolve into gas giants because their envelope contraction time scales are generally much longer than the gas depletion time scales ( paper iv ) .",
    "we now consider the influence of the ice - line barrier . in a series of models with a @xmath17 bump ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ma]b and c ) , much larger populations of gas giants are generated than the barrier - free models with corresponding values of @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ma]a ) .",
    "furthermore , in these models , the semimajor axis distribution of gas giants shows a ramp up in the planetary population with @xmath1333au ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ma]b and c ) .",
    "although in the limit of small @xmath4 , gas giants can also form without the ice line barrier , their @xmath6 distribution is essentially logarithmic ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ma]a , also see paper i ) .",
    "this dichotomy can be attributed to the role of the ice - line barrier which is to preserve cores until they become sufficiently massive ( with @xmath134 ) to efficiently accrete gas .",
    "planetesimals formed at large distances from their host stars migrate inward and become trapped near the ice line .",
    "they accumulate and coagulate into embryos at this barrier until either the disk gas is depleted or they attain a critical mass to initiate efficient gas accretion .",
    "however , planetesimals formed interior to the ice line can not halt their inward type i migration until they have reached the proximity of their host stars .",
    "if these close - in planets are embedded in residual gas , their eccentricities would be effectively damped and their further growth would be inhibited by dynamical isolation . after the severe depletion of the disk gas , dynamical instability can lead to orbit crossing , cohesive collisions , and emergence of relatively massive short - period planets .",
    "although some of these cores may have @xmath135 , the depletion of gas would prevent the build up of their envelopes . around solar type stars , it is difficult for gas giants to form in close - in orbits .",
    "after they have acquired planet masses comparable to those of jupiter and saturn , gas giants formed near the ice line barrier open gaps and undergo type ii migration ( figures [ fig : mig ] ) .",
    "however , since the ice line barrier is only effective for a range of modest @xmath136 yr@xmath1 , most gas giants emerge in relatively passive disks and the extent of their migration is somewhat limited . consequently , the fraction of stars with short - period gas giants ( @xmath137 ) is much reduced in the models with the ice - line barrier than the low-@xmath4 models in which the ice - line barrier effect is neglected ( see further discussions in  3.7 ) . since the magnitude of @xmath137 predicted with these new models is comparable to its observed value ( @xmath138 ) , we no longer need to invoke extensive disruption mechanisms for the excess predicted short - period gas giants .",
    "the reduction in the gas giants type ii migration , due to their late emergence , also helps to preserve the upturn in their @xmath6 ( or @xmath36 ) distribution which is a signature of their formative environment rather than some evolutionary outcomes .",
    "overall , these simulated results are in a better agreement with the observed data .",
    "there are also many cores trapped near the ice - line barrier which do not have sufficient mass to accrete gas prior to its severe depletion .",
    "when @xmath23 reduces below @xmath139 , these cores resume their type i migration due to the removal of the ice line barrier .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath17 of the residual gas is generally too low for the initially trapped cores with @xmath140 a few @xmath141 to undergo extensive migration .",
    "this modest population of rocky planets reside close to the habitable zone ( hereafter hz ) slightly interior ( at 1 - 3 au ) to the ice line barrier region ( see further discussions in  3.7 ) .",
    "since these cores form in nearly isothermal regions where gas - phase - vapors and solid - phase - ice coexist , they may contain a substantial amount of life - supporting water .",
    "the orbits of a fraction of these rocky planets may be destabilized by coexisting gas giants in the same systems .",
    "but around host stars without any gas giants , their orbital eccentricity may be damped by their interaction with the residual planetesimals .    despite the production of occasional intermediate - mass ( @xmath142 a few @xmath141 ) planets at @xmath143 a few au , a characteristic `` planet desert '' ( see paper i ) is still prominent in figures  [ fig : ma]b and c. the boundaries of the desert domain are modified by the efficiency of the barrier .",
    "since the ice - line barrier can not act to preserve them , low - mass ( @xmath144 ) planetesimals and embryos formed interior to it migrate to the proximity of their host stars in the presence of relatively small amount of residual disk gas .",
    "we now consider the influence of initial @xmath15 enhancement near the ice - line barrier . as we stated in the introduction , @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in principle",
    ", the enhancement of @xmath15 by a factor of @xmath91 near the ice line leads to rapid growth of embryos with relatively large isolation masses . in the comparisons between these two series of models , we find that the distributions of gas giants are similar , albeit a @xmath91 enhancement leads to the emergence of marginally more detectable planets , especially in the limit of modest values of @xmath147 .",
    "the weak dependence is also partially caused by the ice - line barrier being effective only after @xmath148 yr@xmath1 so that relatively massive embryos which emerged during earlier epochs of active disk evolution would not be preserved .",
    "this self - regulated retention condition reduces the advantage of the initially more massive disks .",
    "the principle factor for the formation probability of gas giants is the existence of the ice line barrier rather than any localized initial concentration of @xmath15 .      in order to quantitatively",
    "compare with observations , we determine the fraction ( @xmath149 ) of stars which harbor planets within the present radial - velocity detectability limit .",
    "following @xcite , we take a conservative estimate on the magnitude of radial velocity ( @xmath150 m/s ) and orbital periods ( @xmath151 years ) for the detectable conditions .",
    "because we artificially terminate type i and ii migrations near disk inner edge and we have not specified a survival criterion for the close - in planets , we exclude close - in planets with @xmath152au in the evaluation of @xmath149 .",
    "( see further discussions on the short - period planets in  3.7 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath149 are plotted as a function of @xmath4 in figure  [ fig : eta_j_c1]a .",
    "the dependence of @xmath149 on @xmath4 is much weaker among models which take into account the ice line effect than those without it .",
    "even for @xmath1531 , the predicted @xmath149 can be comparable to the observed data @xcite .",
    "migrating cores are trapped near the ice line , almost independent of the strength of type i migration , and they accrete planetesimals until either 1 ) they can start runaway gas accretion or 2 ) @xmath17 near the ice line is reduced below @xmath154 and they resume their type i migration .",
    "the coupling effect of mri activity and the ice line barrier can enhance formation and retention rates of gas giants without significant reduction of the strength of type i migration .",
    "a close inspection of figures [ fig : mig ] shows that although the paucity of intermediate - mass intermediate - period planets is maintained , the evacuation of this planetary desert is less severe in the series of models with the ice - line barrier than those which neglected this effect .",
    "the upper @xmath50 boundary of the desert shifts downward with increasing @xmath4 and @xmath155 where a large @xmath6 limit extends to the hz .",
    "a few planets emerge in this sparsely populated region and some of them have masses and orbits similar to those of the earth . in order to extrapolate the probability of finding habitable planets from the known extrasolar planets , we adopt the terrestrial planet finder",
    "s convention for the domains of habitable planets @xcite .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : eta_j_c1]b the fraction of stars with habitable planets ( @xmath156 ) which is defined as planets with @xmath157 and @xmath158 au around g dwarfs .",
    "these planets are formed in the ice line barrier region of those disks which contain a marginal amount of heavy elements .",
    "their progenitors growth toward super - earth - mass cores is slow .",
    "when they finally acquired sufficient masses to efficiently accrete gas , the magnitude of @xmath17 near their orbits also decreases below @xmath154 such that the residual disk does not have adequate mass to promote these protoplanets to attain their full growth potential prior to the severe gas depletion .",
    "however , a relatively small @xmath17 is needed to induce the super - earth - mass cores to undergo fractional orbital decay .",
    "the late `` leakage '' of a few cores into the planetary desert does not significantly alter the landscape of the planetary desert , albeit the presence of a few intermediate - mass intermediate - period planets is no longer forbidden ( also see previous subsection ) .",
    "based on the assumption that protostellar disks attain the same fraction of heavy elements as that contained in their host stars , we showed , in paper ii , that gas giant planet formation is more prolific around metal - rich than metal - poor stars .",
    "in addition to the availability of planet building blocks , disks with enhanced metallicities also contain a greater population of grains which can modify the ionization fraction , the depth of the active layer , and potentially the retention efficiency of the ice - line barrier .",
    "but the range of @xmath23 over which the ice line barrier is effective does not depend explicitly on the magnitude of the metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta_j_metal ] shows the values of @xmath149 which are plotted as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "open circles with error bars are observational data compiled by @xcite .",
    "triangles with dotted line shows the results without type i migration , which are based on similar results to those shown by paper iv .",
    "the correlation reflects the fact that higher [ fe / h ] enhances formation of cores large enough for runaway gas accretion through higher @xmath159 . in paper iv",
    ", we suggested that the effect of type i migration enhances the @xmath149[fe / h ] correlation , because type i migration is more efficient in metal - poor disks .",
    "squares with dashed line represent the results from models in which type i migration with @xmath160 is included and the ice line barrier is neglected",
    ". a modest @xmath149 amplitude and its steep [ fe / h ] dependence are in a better agreement with the observed data @xcite than the models in which the effects of type i migration has been altogether neglected ( represented by triangles and dotted lines ) .",
    "we now consider models in which the ice - line barrier is taken into account .",
    "the filled pentagons and circles with solid lines respectively represent models without and with the @xmath159 enhancement at the ice line . despite an order of magnitude increase in the value of @xmath161 ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath149 for the ice - line barrier models is comparable to or larger than those in which the ice line barrier effect is neglected .",
    "we note from the comparison of the pentagon and filled - circle data points that the magnitude of @xmath149 increases @xmath159 by a similar factor for all metallicity .",
    "this trend is another indication that the ice - line barrier essentially suppresses the depletion by type i migration effect once the gas surface density decreases below @xmath154 .",
    "the greater availability of planet - building blocks enhances the probability of gas giant formation in these models .      in paper iv",
    ", we carried out a survey of short - period planets which can migrate to within 0.03 au from their host stars . in figures  [ fig : histo1 ] , we plot mass functions of short - period planets in the cases ( a ) without the ice - line barrier , ( b ) with the ice - line barrier and no @xmath15 enhancement , and ( c ) with the ice - line barrier and the @xmath15 enhancement . in the upper panels , we assume that all the short - period planets survive without any further coagulation near their host stars . after the severe depletion of the disk gas , however , dynamical instability may develop and induce the coagulation of planets . in the lower panels , we consider the limiting case that around individual host stars , all planetesimals migrate to their proximity would merge into one short - period planet .",
    "if we neglect the ice - barrier ( the upper panel in figure  [ fig : histo1]a ) , the mass distribution of these short - period planets would be biased toward jupiter mass for @xmath162 ( filled circles ) . however , even with a relatively small but finite value of @xmath163 , there would be a population of earth - mass planets . for @xmath164 , the resultant mass function of the short - period planets would be bimodal . for @xmath165 ,",
    "formation of gas giants is inhibited so that the mass function is highly peaked at a few @xmath141 s .    this dichotomy is clearly demonstrated in the upper panel in figure  [ fig : histo2]a where the short - period planets are classified into three populations .",
    "the filled circles , squares , and triangles represent the fraction of stars ( @xmath166 ) which bear short - period planets with @xmath50 in the range of @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "the population of planets with @xmath170 rapidly decreases with @xmath4 , while that of smaller planets decreases more slowly .",
    "the observed value of @xmath171 can be matched with @xmath1720.3 , provided most short - period planets are retained .    in these models , @xmath130 is needed to match @xmath149 of all the gas giant planets and the over - prediction of @xmath166 can still match its observed value under the assumption that more than 95% of the short - period gas giants have perished .",
    "there are also a similar population of intermediate mass ( @xmath173 ) and a much larger population of earth - mass short - period planets .",
    "if all the planets which migrated to the proximity of their individual host stars can subsequently collide and merge , the intermediate and low mass planets would become the building blocks of the massive short - period planets ( see the lower panels in figures  [ fig : histo1]a and  [ fig : histo2]a ) .",
    "but such planets are mostly composed of rocky cores rather than an extended envelope and hd 149026b @xcite is a good candidate for such massive mostly rocky short - period planets . in order to match the observed value of @xmath137 ,",
    "most of these planets must be lost to their host stars .",
    "we now consider the statistical outcome of short - period planet formation in the limit that type i migration is suppressed by the ice - line barrier .",
    "this process not only promotes the emergence of jupiter - like gas giants but also introduces a strong modification in the mass function of the short - period planets ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : histo1]b and c ) .",
    "the effect of the @xmath15 enhancement is small in the function .",
    "compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : histo1]a , the dependence on @xmath4 is very weak with the ice - line barrier .",
    "the magnitude of the observed value of @xmath149 can be matched with @xmath174 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eta_j_c1]a and the middle panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : ma]b and c ) . with this range of parameter ,",
    "the model values of @xmath166 for gas giants ( circles ) are also comparable to that observed , provided some of them have coagulated and most of them have been retained in the proximity of their host stars . the magnitude of @xmath175 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : histo2]b and c ) and the mass distribution of the short - period planets ( figs .",
    "[ fig : histo1]b and c ) indicate that there is a comparable or larger population of short - period intermediate - mass ( @xmath168 ) planets as that of short - period gas giants .",
    "since the value of @xmath50 for the peak of the mass distribution is a function of @xmath4 , its determination can provide valuable calibration for the theoretical models .",
    "the retention efficiency of the short - period planets remains uncertain .",
    "several halting mechanisms have been proposed for the short - period planets .",
    "they include planet - star tidal interaction , magnetospheric cavity , roche - lobe overflow , and trapping at surface density transition zones @xcite .",
    "although the efficiency of these processes is to be determined in the future , the lower mass rocky planets are more likely to survive than the gas giants in most of these scenarios .",
    "thus , we anticipate the prolific discovery of intermediate to low mass close - in planets in the near future searches .",
    "we predict the fraction of stars which bear short - period earth - mass ( @xmath176 ) is comparable to that of all gas giants ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "this result is insensitive to the initial surface density distribution of the heavy elements ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "based on these results and the calibration of @xmath149 for all known planets , we extrapolate @xmath17920 % depending on the magnitude of @xmath4 . the magnitude of @xmath156 can be reduced by perturbations from gas giants that we have not taken into account in our analysis . however , as stated before , for relatively large @xmath4 , the reduction would be small .",
    "in this paper , we confronted two main outstanding challenges to the core accretion scenario : 1 ) the efficient utilization of planets building block material and 2 ) the retention of cores to form gas giant planets despite the hydrodynamic drag by the disk gas on grains and the orbital decay of the protoplanetary cores due to their tidal interaction with the disk gas ( type i migration ) .",
    "we propose that the resolution of these conundrums lies in the existence of an ice line barrier .    in our scenario ,",
    "we identify the ice line as a transition zone for the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the gas disk .",
    "the presence of additional grains outside the ice line reduces the thickness of the active layer and the efficiency of angular momentum transfer . within a range of the disk mass accretion rate ( @xmath23 comparable to that observed for the classical t tauri stars ) , these effects lead to local maxima in the pressure and surface density distribution in the disk . in the region slightly interior to ice line ( closer to the star )",
    ", a super - keplerian gas flow provides a barrier to retain the heavy elements .",
    "consequently , protoplanetary embryos coagulate and grow in mass at this location . up on acquiring several @xmath141",
    ", these cores initiate efficient gas accretion and evolve into gas giants .",
    "since this ice line barrier is effective over a range of modest mass transfer rate ( @xmath180 yr@xmath1 ) , it regulates the formation of the first - generation gas giants during a preferred epoch at a preferred location around their host stars .    in relatively massive disks ,",
    "the emergence of the first - generation planet leads to gap formation . just beyond the outer edge of gap",
    ", another pressure maximum is induced .",
    "similar to the ice line , this local pressure maximum promotes the congregation , coagulation , and rapid growth of later generations of gas giants .",
    "however , the physical extent of the planetary system is limited to the region where the local keplerian speed is comparable to the surface escape speed of the critical mass ( a few @xmath141 ) cores . outside this location , close ( non collisional ) encounters by these cores",
    "lead to ejection of their neighboring planetesimals from the system so that the depletion of the building block material is faster than the cores growth .",
    "although gas giant formation is inhibited in relatively low - mass disks , they may nonetheless be the birth places of earth - mass rocky planets in habitable zones as well as in the proximity of their host stars .",
    "the final assemble of these planets may proceed throughout the age of their host stars .",
    "while , in the post t tauri phase , there is still small amount of residual gas in the disk , many of these entities may undergo type i migration over limited radial range towards their host stars .",
    "after the disk gas is severely depleted , these planets destabilize each other s orbits , albeit the eccentricities of the most massive planets may be suppressed by their gravitational interaction with the less massive residual planetesimals .    through physical collisions , a population of a few-@xmath141 planets",
    "is expected to emerge in the habitable zone around 5 - 20 % of solar type stars .",
    "some close encounters can also lead to limited migration .",
    "nevertheless , a desert in the @xmath2 distribution is likely to be preserved .",
    "the paucity of planets with intermediate mass and semi major axis can be established with various observational surveys in the next few years .",
    "the boundaries of this domain contain valuable information on the efficiency of various process and valuable calibrations for the theoretical models .",
    "many planetesimals and embryos migrate to the proximity of their host stars , especially in the limit of relatively efficient type i migration .",
    "many cohesive collisions may also occur among these planetesimals and embryos in the proximity of their host stars .",
    "provided most of these planets are retained ( despite the effect of their interaction with the magnetosphere and tide of their host stars ) , we anticipate the fraction of solar type stars with short - period earth - mass objects to be several times that of short - period gas giants .",
    "the physical composition of these close - in planets is most likely to be rocky to icy .",
    "their observed mass distribution will enable us to calibrate the magnitude of the type i migration ( the magnitude of @xmath4 ) .",
