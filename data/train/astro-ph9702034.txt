    "from examination of objective prism spectra , bond ( 1974 ) discovered a class of g - type stars with enhanced features of ch and s process elements in their spectra , and with absolute magnitudes placing them near and above the main sequence .",
    "with relatively high velocities and weak metal lines , they appeared to be population ii objects and they were referred as subgiant ch ( sgch ) stars , because he suggested that they would eventually become classical ch stars when they evolved away from the main sequence and up the giant branch .",
    "mcclure ( 1984a , 1985 ) has reviewed status of the barium , ch and related stars , including the sgch stars .",
    "abundance analyses have been done by sneden and bond ( 1976 ) , luck and bond ( 1982 ) , sneden ( 1983 ) , krishnaswamy and sneden ( 1985 ) , smith and lambert ( 1986 ) , luck and bond ( 1991 ) , and smith coleman and lambert ( 1993 ) .",
    "these analyses of a larger sample of stars indicated that most sgch stars are moderately metal deficient with [ fe / h ] = @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and with s process enhancements similar to the barium stars .",
    "the classical ch stars have higher overabundances of the heavy s process elements ( ba through sm ) , and c@xmath3 bands ( indicating c / o @xmath4 1 ) which are lacking in the sgch stars .",
    "the velocities of most of the sgch stars are also moderate , being more like the old disk than the halo .",
    "the essential conclusion of these papers is that despite the name which was originally assigned to them , the sgch stars are probably the progenitors of moderately metal - deficient barium stars rather than the halo ch stars themselves . a low li abundance in the sgch stars",
    "was thought to be a problem with their role as progenitors of the barium or ch stars as pointed out by smith and lambert ( 1986 ) , but lambert , smith and heath ( 1993 ) have dismissed this as being due to contamination of the li line by an unidentified line .    the terminology for the sgch stars has become confusing as a result of the findings of only moderate metal - deficiency .",
    "they tend to be referred to in the literature as `` dwarf barium stars '' ( e.g. jorissen and boffin 1992 , north , jorissen and mayor 1996 ) , and overlap with stars referred to as `` f str @xmath5 '' stars ( north and duquennoy 1991 ) .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 1995 ) refer to `` pre - ba / ch '' stars which undoubtedly includes the sgch stars .",
    "regardless of their role as progenitors of the barium stars or of the ch stars , the frequency of binaries among the sgch stars is of very significant interest .",
    "both the barium and ch stars have been shown to be long period binaries , and their peculiar abundances are likely the result of mass transfer from a former asymptotic giant - branch ( agb ) star whose atmosphere has been contaminated from products of helium shell - flashing ( mcclure , fletcher and nemec 1980 ; mcclure 1983 ; mcclure 1984b ; jorissen and mayor 1988 ; webbink 1986 ; mcclure and woodsworth 1990 ) .",
    "smith and demarque ( 1980 ) first suggested that the sgch stars may be mass - transfer binaries since they found it impossible to explain them by internal mixing of helium core - flash material .",
    "a program was begun by the present author , therefore , in the early 1980 s , to monitor radial velocities of sgch stars .",
    "some very preliminary results from this program have been mentioned in the literature ( mcclure 1985 , 1989 ) indicating a high binary frequency , and luck and bond ( 1991 ) also observed several sgch stars which appeared to exhibit variable velocity . as a result",
    ", most authors have assumed over the last few years that all sgch stars are binaries . the evidence from these preliminary data , however , is somewhat meager .",
    "the present paper presents more complete velocity data for this sample of stars , and sets the binary frequency for the sgch stars on a firm basis .",
    "results of similar velocity monitoring of sgch stars has recently been mentioned in a conference paper presented by north , jorissen , and mayor ( 1996 ) .",
    "the radial - velocity observations were made at the dominion astrophysical observatory in victoria , using the radial - velocity spectrometer at the coud focus of the 1.2 meter telescope .",
    "see fletcher et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and mcclure et al .",
    "( 1985 ) for a description of the instrument .",
    "it is capable of a precision of about @xmath6 km s@xmath7 , although with the limited integration time for each observation , the observational error for the sgch stars is closer to double that value .",
    "the stellar sample was taken from bond ( 1974 ) , supplemented by a few stars from bond ( private communication ) that were analyzed later by luck and bond ( 1991 ) .",
    "one of these , hd122202 , is representative of an earlier class of mid f - type stars with strong sr , discussed by bidelman ( 1981 ) , and more recently by north and duquennoy ( 1991 ) .",
    "they were referred to by these authors as f str @xmath5 stars , but they are almost certainly just earlier examples of g - type sgch stars .    for most of the stars in this sample luck and bond ( 1991 ) list radial velocities measured from the same coud plates from which they analyzed abundances .",
    "these velocities are of comparable precision and can be combined with the present data after a small systematic velocity shift of @xmath2 km s@xmath7 ( see below ) .",
    "the radial - velocities and julian dates ( @xmath8 days ) for each sgch star are listed in table 1 . those few entries with julian dates",
    "earlier than @xmath9 and marked with an asterisk are from luck and bond ( 1991 ) .",
    "the velocity data are plotted versus julian date in the upper part of figure 1 .",
    "the time span exhibited in these plots is nearly 25 years . considering that the errors of velocities are approximately the size of the plotted symbols , it is apparent that at least eight of the ten stars exhibit velocity variations representative of long - term binary motion .",
    "one further star hd 4395 exhibits some evidence of variable velocity , although the amplitude is small , and no convincing binary orbit could be calculated . the binary frequency is consistent , therefore , with all sgch stars being binaries , with orbits viewed at random orientations .",
    "luck and bond ( 1991 ) also suggested that three of their stars are velocity variables , although one of these , hd 88446 , is the one star in the present analysis that does not appear to exhibit long term variations .",
    "orbits have been computed for six of the ten sgch stars , although for those for which the period is comparable to the time span of the observations the orbits should be considered somewhat preliminary . because the velocity variations for the sgch stars are very small , one must be careful about systematic differences when combining data from a different program and different instruments .",
    "see the discussion , for example , on standard - velocity zero - pints by iau commission 30 ( andersen 1990 ) , where uncertainties approaching 1 km s@xmath7 are discussed .",
    "the orbits were first calculated , therefore , using only the data from the present set of observations , giving the velocities from luck and bond ( 1991 ) zero weight .",
    "residuals from the velocity curves for their observations were calculated and a systematic difference of @xmath10 km s@xmath7 was found with a mean error of @xmath11 km s@xmath7 . the apparently constant velocity star hd 88446 also gives a similar positive error ( @xmath12 km s@xmath7 ) with respect to the present data for that star , although this residual was not included in the average because a long term variation for the star can not be ruled out .",
    "the luck and bond data were all shifted by @xmath2 km s@xmath7 , therefore , and the orbits were calculated again , giving all observations unit weight .",
    "the resulting average residual for the luck and bond data from the final orbital calculations is @xmath13 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the orbital elements for the six stars are listed in table 2 .",
    "the velocities as a function of phase , resulting from these solutions are plotted in the lower part of figure 1 , and phases and residuals from the orbital curves are listed for the individual observations in table 1 .",
    "orbit calculations were attempted for one further star hd 182274 , but a unique orbit could not be determined . an orbit with low eccentricity and a period of 8000 days or more is possible , but the amplitude and period are uncertain .",
    "it is also possible that the orbit might have very high eccentricity , with the maximum velocity occurring immediately before the present observations were begun , but it could be several more years before this could be confirmed or ruled out .",
    "the cumulative distribution of eccentricities and mass functions are shown in figure 2 for the sgch stars along with similar distributions for the barium and ch stars and for normal k giants ; the latter distributions are taken from mcclure and woodsworth ( 1990 ) . in both the eccentricity and mass functions ,",
    "the sgch star distributions lie between those for the barium and ch stars .",
    "relative to normal k giants there is evidence , from the lower eccentricities , for orbital dissipation in the sgch sample , and also for a much more homogeneous distribution of mass functions .",
    "mcclure and woodsworth ( 1990 ) showed that the barium and ch star mass - function distributions could be modeled with stars of approximately uniform secondary mass , whereas that for k giants required a large range in mass .",
    "they found , assuming reasonable masses for the barium and ch primaries , that in both cases the secondary masses are near 0.6 solar masses , typical of white dwarfs .",
    "the same must be true for the sgch stars , given that their mass functions are so similar to those of the barium stars .",
    "the distributions exhibited in figure 2 lend support to the suggestion of luck and bond ( 1991 ) based on chemical abundances , that the sgch stars may be precursors to a moderately metal - poor population of giant barium stars .",
    "the orbital dissipation supports the hypothesis that these stars have undergone mass exchange .",
    "radial velocity measurements over the last @xmath14 years , have shown that the sgch stars are likely all binaries .",
    "a similar conclusion has recently been suggested in a conference paper by north , jorissen and mayor ( 1996 ) , who have found a high binary frequency among what they refer to as barium dwarfs , which include sgch stars as well as earlier f - type stars with strong lines of s process elements .",
    "the orbital eccentricities and mass functions for sgch stars are distributed in a very similar way to those of the barium and ch stars .",
    "it is likely that the sgch stars are precursors to the barium stars as suggested by luck and bond ( 1991 ) , their peculiar abundances being derived from mass transfer of material contaminated through helium shell - flashing in an agb star that has since evolved to become an unseen white - dwarf .",
    "i wish to thank murray fletcher , les saddlemyer , doug bond , and frank younger for help over the years in operation of the radial - velocity spectrometer .",
    "i thank howard bond for providing me with a list of sgch stars many years ago prior to publication .",
