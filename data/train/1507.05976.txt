    "in a recent paper by bzdak and skokov  @xcite , it was argued that the number of participants dependence of the multiplicity as a function of centrality provided a crucial test which might discriminate between the description of heavy ion collisions provided by the color glass condensate@xcite and that of the wounded nucleon model@xcite .",
    "their basic idea is very simple : in the simplest version of the wounded nucleon model , the rapidity dependence of the multiplicity distribution for a collision of a projectile nucleon against @xmath1 nucleons in the target is a simple triangular distribution going from a number proportional the number or participants for rapidities close to that of the nucleus to a number of order 1 at rapidities corresponding to the beam nucleon .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrawn ]     collisions as a function of rapidity in the simplest version of the wounded nucleon model.,height=151 ]    on the other hand , the simplest version of the color glass condensate model is that the rapidity distribution in the fragmentation of the target nucleus is of order @xmath2 but elsewhere of order 1 up to logarithms of the number of participants .",
    "this is because for a probe which has a lorentz gamma factor of order @xmath3 relative to the nucleus , the nucleons in the nucleus act coherently , and for the typical transverse momentum scale associated with particle production , the nucleus appears as a black disk .",
    "the multiplicity is controlled by the number of partons in the proton evolved to the saturation scale of the nucleus .",
    "in fact there is a mild logarithmic correction to this , so the multiplicity scales as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "schematically the color glass condensate description is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectracg ] .     collisions as a function of rapidity in the simplest version of a model for the color glass condensate.,height=151 ]    the number of participants dependence of the pseudorapidity distributions in p@xmath0 collisions at the lhc energy has been recently measured by the atlas @xcite and alice @xcite collaborations . in atlas",
    ", they extract the number of participant dependence of the integrated multiplicity under a variety of different assumptions concerning the cross - section for the proton penetrating through the nucleus .",
    "these correspond to a fixed glauber cross section for the proton and to two different parameterizations of the glauber - gribov description @xcite .",
    "the glauber - gribov model allows the proton cross - section to vary by gausssian fluctuations .",
    "similar procedures have been also applied by the alice experiment .    in the analysis of the next section ,",
    "we compare expectations from the naive versions of the wounded nucleon model and that of the color glass condensate to the experimental data .",
    "this analysis consists of comparing the @xmath2 dependence predicted by the two models as a function of rapidity to that of the experimental data .",
    "neither model gives an acceptable description of the data for any extraction of the number of participant dependence .",
    "how might one resolve this impasse ?",
    "a hint is suggested by the extraction of the relationship between number of participants and multiplicity used to determine centrality .",
    "one might argue that in the fragmentation region of the nucleus , all models agree that the multiplicity dependence is linear in the number of participants .",
    "if so , the closest we come to the fragmentation region with the data is for @xmath5 . while this is not forward enough to really be in the nuclear fragmentation region , we see that the data favors large fluctuations in the proton cross section",
    "this suggests there might be fluctuations in the proton saturation momentum .    before we discuss fluctuations of the saturation scale ,",
    "let us remark that there exists a number of theoretical papers that took an effort to describe the p@xmath0 data within the framework of the different versions of the cgc - based models .",
    "a complete list of such models can be found in a review paper @xcite that was , however , published before the first lhc run .",
    "more recently successful description of the p@xmath0 data has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "one expects a relationship between the cross section and the saturation momentum .",
    "if we require that the local density of gluons , denoted as @xmath6 , in an impact parameter model of the proton factorizes as proportional to the number of gluons per unit area on average times an impact parameter profile , which for simplicity can be assumed to be exponential , then @xmath7 requiring that the cross - section corresponds to the radius at which this density has some fixed value @xmath8 , perhaps @xmath9 , we conclude that the radius of the proton grows as @xmath10 therefore the cross section @xmath11 will fluctuate if the saturation momentum does .",
    "there are of course many weaknesses of this analysis , perhaps the most important one is that we do not really know the impact parameter distribution for matter inside the proton , so that the exponential form , while valid at very large radii , may be misleading .",
    "the emergence of the saturation scale and geometrical scaling in the theory of the color glass condensate has been introduced in refs .",
    "it is based on the fact that the nonlinear evolution equations in small bjorken @xmath12 regime @xcite possess traveling wave solutions @xcite .",
    "it has been argued , however , in ref .",
    "@xcite and expanded in ref .",
    "@xcite that the scaling cgc solutions have exponential tails which are unphysical , and therefore have to be modified .",
    "this modification is based on the analogy with the statistical physics , and has clear interpretation in the dipole model , where the small tail of the amplitude is essentially counting a number of interacting dipoles .",
    "this discrete nature of the tail introduces stochastic diffusion that affects the shape of the entire amplitude , which  event by event  satisfies geometrical scaling , with the saturation scale that is , however , somewhat different than the one obtained in the mean field approximation .",
    "it has been argued that these fluctuations are gaussian in the logarithm of the saturation momentum @xcite , and controlled by a probability distribution : @xmath13 where@xmath14 here @xmath15 is the proton saturation momentum fluctuating around its logarithmic average denoted as @xmath16 ( with @xmath17  gev@xmath18 being an arbitrary momentum scale , which cancels out in ( [ distr ] ) ) .",
    "it has been furthermore argued in @xcite that the width @xmath19 of the distribution ( [ distr ] ) is growing with the energy of the collision and depends upon the rapidity where measurements are made .",
    "one has to stress , however , that this result is only asymptotic , and  as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite admit explicitly  there is no general analytical proof of this result and its status is still that of a conjecture .",
    "phenomenologically scaling violations corresponding ro @xmath20 have been searched for in the dis data with negative result @xcite .",
    "there are two possible ways out from this situation .",
    "either ( [ sigma_y ] ) holds down to the present energies ( or presently accessible bjorken @xmath12 s ) , in which case the distribution ( [ distr ] ) collapses to @xmath21 , or result ( [ sigma_y ] ) is only asymptotic , and for low energies @xmath19 tends to a constant . as we shall show in the following , in such a case geometrical",
    "scaling would still hold .    to this end",
    "let us consider a dis amplitude @xmath22 that exhibits geometrical scaling with respect to the fluctuating saturation momentum @xmath23:@xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath22 depends on @xmath26 through @xmath12-dependence of @xmath27 .",
    "for illustrative purposes let s assume , following ref .",
    "@xcite , that@xmath28 representing a step - like front moving with rapdity @xmath29 , which plays a role of an evolution time . averaging ( [ ttheta ] ) with probability distribution ( [ distr ] ) gives:@xmath30 so the new scaling variable is@xmath31 it is also straightforward to check that if @xmath22 is a function of @xmath32 then , after integrating over fluctuations , @xmath33 so that geometrical scaling is preserved so long as the width of fluctuations is rapidity independent .",
    "we do not have any explicit model leading to the fluctuations with the constant width , although  given the phenomenological arguments above ",
    "such fluctuations are compatible with the dis data .",
    "the fluctuations of the saturation momentum we are employing here are caused by an evolution with energy of the initial conditions of the forward scattering amplitude and are associated with the low density region ( _ i.e. _ with a region where the amplitude is small , which means rather large bjorken @xmath12 s ) . but for large @xmath12 s parton distributions are non - perturbative , and",
    "the fluctuations can be of order one .",
    "in contrast , it was established that pomeron loops effects @xcite , once at small @xmath12 , are small , and therefore they cause only a small change in the scale of rapidity fluctuations as one goes to higher and higher energies . large nonperturbative fluctuations in turn ,",
    "propagate to small @xmath12 s _ i.e. _ to the region we are interested in .    in the following",
    "shall ignore the rapidity dependence and treat @xmath19 as a constant at fixed lhc energy .",
    "obviously one needs to include beam energy dependence if this result would be used over a very wide range of energy from rhic to the lhc .    in the analysis of p@xmath0 collisions which we present below",
    ", we will consider fluctuations only of the nucleon . including the fluctuations of the saturation scale in the nucleus",
    "might be done , but we expect a small effect .",
    "this is because the fractional change in the saturation momentum squared of the nucleus should be reduced by random walks .",
    "we might expect @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of participating nucleons in the target nucleus . in pp collisions",
    ", we would need to consider fluctuations in both protons .",
    "without such inclusion of the effects of fluctuations of the nuclear saturation momentum , the results we present here should be taken to demonstrate qualitatively and semi - quantitatively the effects of fluctuating saturation momenta , and quantitative conclusions should await a more systematic analysis .",
    "in the wounded nucleon ( wn ) model @xcite multiplicity is given in terms of the number of wounded nucleons multiplied by a function describing radiation of particles by one struck participant:@xmath36 total number of participants is therefore @xmath37 .",

    "the issue of a local fluctuating saturation momentum was addressed by iancu and mclerran @xcite within the context of conformal field theory , but there is as yet no practical implementation of such ideas useful for understanding experimental data . furthermore , in our simple analysis we have neglected other sources of fluctuations that have been taken into account in ref .",

    "<S> we argue that large fluctuations in the saturation momentum are necessary to explain the atlas and alice data on p@xmath0 collisions measured at the lhc . using a form for the distribution of fluctuations motivated by theoretical studies of the non - linear evolution equations for the color glass condensate , we find a remarkably good agreement between theory and the measured distributions . </S>",
    "<S> if the saturation momentum fluctuates , we argue that the cross section for a proton probe should also fluctuate , consistent with previous observations . </S>"
