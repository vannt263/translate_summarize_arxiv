    "the dynamics of interacting species has deserved renewed interest since a simple mathematical model had been proposed independently by lotka @xcite and volterra @xcite .",
    "the model predicts an oscillatory temporal evolution of a predator - prey system and has been widely used as a jumping - off place for models of many organism societies @xcite .",
    "however , some of its appealingly simple assumptions fail in taking into account relevant features of such systems . for instance , an individual is generally affected by its local environment and not by the global density of each specie .",
    "the importance of space , considered as a limiting resource which would enhance competitive coexistence , has also been pointed out @xcite .",
    "it is in this context that lattice gas versions of the model caught recently new attention @xcite as a suitable way to address these questions and simulate practical examples .",
    "we propose a model consisting of a system of two types of interacting particles residing in the sites of a lattice .",
    "one type of particle represents a prey and the other a predator .",
    "each site can be either empty ( @xmath0 ) , occupied by one prey ( @xmath1 ) or occupied by one predator ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the system evolves in time according to a stochastic irreversible dynamics with local interactions similar to those occurring in contact process models @xcite and also in lattice gas models describing chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the local interactions considered are : predators can be spontaneously annihilated , prey can be autocatalytically created , and predators can also be autocatalytically created at the expense of prey , in this stochastic treatment of the system , with local evolution rules , fluctuations inherent to a many - body irreversible interacting system are taken into account from a microscopic point of view .    we have analyzed the states of the system as a function of the creation rates of prey and predators and of the death rate of predators considering square lattices and one dimensional lattices . our computer simulation and mean - field analysis indicate that the system can exhibit four kinds of states : two absorbing states , one being a prey - absorbing state and the other a vacuum - absorbing state ; and two active states , one presenting an oscillatory behavior in the population densities and the other characterized by constant stationary population densities .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "[ model ] defining the model and setting up its master equation . in sec .",
    "[ meanfield ] we use mean field approximations to solve the system of equations associated to the master equation .",
    "there is a qualitative description of the different type of solutions that we have found for the one - site and the pair approximations .",
    "[ simul ] describes how computer simulations were performed and the results that we obtained . a summary and concluding remarks are stated in sec .  [ final ] .",
    "finally , let us make a short digression on terminology . in this work",
    "we use many times the terms ` prey ' and ` predator ' .",
    "eventhough inspired in mathematical ecology , they are only generic names . actually , words like ` hosts ' or ` healthy cells ' and ` parasites ' or ` infected cells ' may be more accurate to mimic a biological process . or we may simply call them particles of type a and b.",
    "consider a lattice of @xmath3 sites which can be either empty , occupied by a prey or occupied by a predator . at each time",
    "step a site is randomly chosen .",
    "for that site , we denote by @xmath4(@xmath5 ) the number of nearest neighbors occupied by prey(predators ) , and by @xmath6 the total number of nearest neighbors . within this model",
    "three cases need to be considered :    \\(a ) the site is empty and it becomes either occupied with a prey with a probability @xmath7 or else it remains empty with probability @xmath8 .",
    "\\(b ) the site is occupied by a prey , which is either replaced by a predator with a probability @xmath9 or else remains as a prey with probability @xmath10 .",
    "\\(c ) the site is occupied by a predator , which is either vacated with a probability @xmath11 or else remains as a predator with probability @xmath12 .",
    "the markovian process defined above involves three parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath11 , which are associated to three subprocesses .",
    "subprocess ( a ) describes the birth of prey , subprocess ( b ) the death of prey and simultaneous birth of predators , and subprocess ( c ) the spontaneous death of predators .",
    "the state of the system is represented by where or @xmath15 according to whether the site @xmath16 is empty , occupied by a prey or occupied by a predator .",
    "let @xmath17 be the probability of state @xmath18 at time @xmath19 and let @xmath20 be the probability per unit time of a cyclic permutation of variable @xmath21 .",
    "that is , if @xmath22 or @xmath15 , then @xmath23 is the transition probability to @xmath24 or @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the evolution of @xmath26 is governed by the master equation , @xmath27 where the state denoted by @xmath28 is obtained from state @xmath29 by an anticyclic permutation of the variable @xmath21 .    according to the local rules of the model , defined above",
    ", we have :    [ trans ] @xmath30    where the summation is over the @xmath6 nearest neighbor sites and @xmath31 is the kronecker delta .    by rescaling the time the process is found to be invariant under the transformation @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a positive constant .",
    "hence we restrict ourselves to a set of parameters such that they satisfy the condition @xmath36 .",
    "this is automatically satisfied by writing @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "all the figures have been made in terms of parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the average of the state function @xmath42 is defined by : @xmath43    from eqs .",

    "let us make the following definitions :    [ correl ] @xmath47    where @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 can take any one of the values @xmath51 or @xmath15 . using eqs .",
    "( [ trans ] ) we may write the time evolution equations for some of these probabilities as    [ system1 ] @xmath52    these expressions constitute a hierarchic system of equations .",
    "the time evolution of the one - site correlations @xmath53 involve the two - site correlations @xmath54 , the time evolution of the two - site correlations involve the three - site correlations @xmath55 , and so on .",
    "a truncation of this hierarchic system , which we consider in the next section , is the starting point for obtaining approximate solutions to the problem .",
    "in order to obtain approximate solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ system1 ] ) we use a truncation scheme @xcite .",
    "the simplest truncation scheme is obtained by writing the probability of a cluster of sites as the product of the probability of each site .",
    "a truncation of higher order , that is of order @xmath56 , consists in writing any correlation in terms of correlations of order @xmath57 and less than @xmath57 .",
    "consider a cluster of @xmath58 sites and denote it by @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be the sets of points in the ` core ' and ` boundary ' of cluster @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the ` core ' @xmath60 is chosen to have @xmath62 sites .",
    "the conditional probability @xmath63 is approximated by the product @xmath64 .",
    "therefore the probability @xmath65 of cluster @xmath59 is given by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the probability of the cluster of @xmath57 sites formed by site @xmath16 and the sites of @xmath60 .",
    "in this approximation one obtains a closed set of equations for the one - site correlation @xmath53 .",
    "this is accomplished by writing any two - site correlations @xmath54 as the product @xmath69 .",
    "three one - site correlations are present , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , but only two can be independent . we choose @xmath71 and @xmath72 so that @xmath73 . the time evolution of these variables are then    [ system01 ] @xmath74    since we seek for homogeneous solutions we write @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77",

    "this point becomes unstable giving rise to a nontrivial stable fixed point for which @xmath81 and @xmath82 , namely an active state .",
    "two regions can be distinguished according to the way the nontrivial fixed point is approached . in region ii , the fixed point is an asymptotically stable node ( real eigenvalues ) whereas in region iii it is an asymptotically stable focus ( complex eigenvalues ) .",
    "this implies the emergence of damped oscillations in the population densities of the system .",
    "the line that separates regions ii and iii is given by @xmath83 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath11 are defined in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "this approximation consists in writing the three - site correlations in terms of two - site and one - site correlations . in this case equation   ( [ recip ] ) leads to the following expression for the probability of a cluster of three sites , @xmath85 where sites @xmath16 and @xmath86 are nearest neighbors of site @xmath87 .",
    "we also seek for spatially homogeneous and isotropic solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ system1 ] ) . in this case",
    "we may drop the indexes in @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we then have three one - site correlations @xmath88 , @xmath89 and nine two - site correlations @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "however , only five of them are independent .",
    "we choose them to be @xmath92 , the prey density , @xmath93 , the predator density , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the equations for these variables are    [ system2 ] @xmath97    where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",

    "they have two trivial fixed points : @xmath104 and @xmath105 that correspond to the prey - absorbing and vacuum - absorbing states respectively .",

    "region ii has an asymptotically stable node whereas region iii shows an asymptotically stable focus . at the transition line ,",
    "fixed points are asymptotically one - tangent stable focuses .",
    "this is due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues associated to the dominant eigenvector and implies the emergence of damped oscillations in the population densities of the system .    for sufficiently small values of @xmath41",
    "a hopf bifurcation takes place at a critical line .",
    "inside region iv limit cycles are present as shown in fig .",
    "[ limitcycle ] .",
    "these results can also be seen in fig .",

    "[ simulprofile ] .",
    "these states are characterized by short transients of less than 1000 mcs .",
    "an active state in the phase diagram means that the lifetime of the system is much longer than 30000 mcs .",
    "the states in region ii have a constant mean value of the population densities and our analysis does not indicate any oscillatory behavior in this region .",
    "this behavior can be also seen from the graph of the spectral density @xmath110of their temporal evolution , shown in fig .",
    "[ non_osc ] .",
    "spectral densities were obtained using the fourier transform ( ft ) of temporal samples @xcite : @xmath111 @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the stationary population density at time @xmath57 . to avoid a divergence in @xmath114 at @xmath115 we subtracted to each temporal sample its mean value , thus obtaining a zero average process .",
    "spectral densities in fig .",

    "[ osc ] were smoothed by an averaging process over nearest neighbors .    as @xmath41",
    "is decreased for a fixed value of @xmath116 a transition takes place from region ii to region iii , consisting in the emergence of temporal oscillations in the population densities of the system .",
    "the oscillatory behavior is corroborated by the clear maximum in the spectral density , as seen in fig .",
    "the degree of oscillation is measured by the eight of the maximum value of the spectral density @xmath117 .",
    "we define a transition point as that in which the low modes of the spectral density ( @xmath118 ) become as relevant ( have the same value ) as its maximum @xmath117 .",
    "the transition line between regions ii and iii was determined following this criterion . increasing c in region ii we get closer to the second order kinetic phase transition ( kpt ) . as a consequence ,",
    "long range fluctuations become highly relevant and predominance of the low modes is to be expected . for this reason",
    ", care should be taken about the reliability of the right end of this line ( where regions i , ii and iii meet in fig .",
    "[ phdiagsimul ] ) .",
    "since the line is so close to the second order kpt , low modes become important before @xmath117 suffers a significant decrease , leading to an overlap in @xmath119 .",
    "simulation results indicate that oscillations become more evident as @xmath41 decreases , i.e. the maximum of @xmath110 increases as @xmath120 .",
    "also @xmath121 decreases in this limit , for @xmath122 and @xmath123 : @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "this behavior is in good qualitative agreement with the pair approximation predictions .",
    "increasing @xmath41 , @xmath126 also grows , reaching a limit value until the oscillation disappears .",
    "for @xmath106 this value corresponds to a period of @xmath127 mcs .",
    "region iv in fig .",
    "[ phdiagsimul ] represents vacuum - absorbing states .",
    "using lattices up to @xmath128 the vacuum - absorbing region reduces its height with the lattice size of the system .",
    "this is in agreement with the pair - approximation predictions that the vacuum - absorbing state occurs only when @xmath129 .",
    "but it still remains to be studied the behavior of this region as @xmath130 , in particular for the case @xmath131 ( where @xmath132 ) .    in regions",
    "i to iv , the system evolves towards an active or absorbing state independently of the initial densities of prey and predators .",
    "this is not the case for the parameter set of the grey region in fig .",
    "[ phdiagsimul ] . in this region , depending on the initial densities , the system will reach an oscillating state or will become trapped in either of its two absorbing states . in the last case , the time it takes for the system to become trapped is much less than the transient of any simulation resulting in an active state . a possible way to treat both this and the finite size problem ( previous paragraph )",
    "is mentioned in sec .",
    "[ final ] .    in order to analyze , from the simulations ,",
    "whether the system presents oscillatory synchronized collective states or if the oscillations occur at a local level , we studied the standard deviation of the temporal samples @xmath133    for sets of values of the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 inside the region iii , we have verified that increasing the lattice size @xmath134 of the system @xmath18 decays as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the number of sites in the lattice .",
    "however it still remains to be seen what happens for values of @xmath137 . in the hypothetical case that @xmath18 tends to a finite value as @xmath138 , the system should display synchronized collective oscillatory states which should correspond to the region iv in fig .",
    "[ phdiagpairs ] , as found in the pair approximation analysis .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of two competing species from a stochastic point of view developed by using a lattice gas model .",
    "a regular square lattice was considered where each site can be empty , occupied by one prey or one predator .",
    "the system evolves in time according to irreversible stochastic local rules .",
    "the system presents two absorbing states : a prey - absorbing state and a vacuum - absorbing state .",
    "we have found , by means of a mean field approximation and by computer simulations , that the system also presents active states where prey and predators are continuously being created and annihilated .",
    "these states can be of two types : a stationary one and another where populations of the two species oscillate in time .",
    "mean field results present two kinds of oscillating states : one in which oscillations are damped and another consisting of a stable limit cycle of these quantities .",
    "the transition from one to the other takes place through a hopf bifurcation .",
    "computer simulations also exhibit a prey - absorbing state , an active state with stationary populations and another active state which exhibits oscillations in the population densities .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with mean field predictions . in the two regimes where the probability of spontaneous death of a predator and prey reproduction are very small , simulations are difficult because the system eventually becomes trapped into either the prey - absorbing or the vacuum - absorbing state , even for large systems",
    ". this problem could be overcome by using another procedure in which absorbing states are avoided modifying the model in order to include a small probability of spontaneous prey creation ( of order @xmath139 ) .",
    "another alternative could be to protect the very last individual of each specie against extinction , avoiding completely the two absorbing states .",
    "we are still testing these procedures .",
    "in the region where simulations are conclusive we have observed that oscillations occur at a local level revealing that the oscillatory behaviour displayed by real prey - predator systems might be a local phenomenon . by this",
    "we mean that there is a finite correlation length @xmath140 .",
    "however we do not discard the possibility of having synchronized collective oscillations in the system ( @xmath141 ) in the limit where the predator death probability is very small .",
    "this speculation is based on the fact that mean - field results indicate that a limit cycle is stable in this regime .",
