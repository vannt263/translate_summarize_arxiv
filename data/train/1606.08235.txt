    "the effect of environmental fluctuations on the dynamics of quantum systems has been a longstanding focus of quantum statistical physics .",
    "indeed , the modern fields of quantum dissipation and open quantum systems treat a physical problem by separating it into an identifiable `` system '' , which encompasses a few controllable degrees of freedom , and an environmental `` bath '' ( or reservoir ) @xcite , which consists of infinitely many degrees of freedom and exerts fluctuating forces on the central system . in many physical situations , the spectral statistics of the ( classical or quantum ) fluctuations",
    "is gaussian , such that the underlying physical model of a harmonic bath is adequate .",
    "thereby , infinitely many harmonic oscillators are used in conjunction with a bi - linear system - bath coupling . after integrating over the harmonic bath degrees of freedom ,",
    "a reduced density operator of the system is constructed whose effective non - unitary time - dependence is studied .    a minimal model system which allows to study the role of dissipative fluctuations on the transition dynamics between two quantum mechanical states is the spin - boson model .",
    "it describes a quantum two - level system ( tls ) coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite and has been used for the analysis of such diverse physical phenomena as tunneling of defects in low - temperature amorphous materials @xcite , the role of the solvent on electron transfer in chemical reactions @xcite , energy transfer in biomolecular photoactive complexes @xcite , or the analysis of decoherence and relaxation properties of solid - state qubit devices realized in single - charge and spin quantum dots @xcite and superconducting quantum interference devices @xcite .",
    "a useful tool to investigate quantum systems is through application of a time - dependent external field @xcite .",
    "the impact of such time - dependent driving is usually included by way of a direct coupling of the external field to the central system of interest , while the impact of the time - dependent driving on the environment is not included .",
    "it was recently realized , however , that ancillary driving of the reservoir itself is unavoidable in principle on the nanoscale in many physical applications @xcite .",
    "in fact , as it was recently shown for two model systems , the system of interest becomes subject to an additional bath - induced force component , if an external time - dependent drive couples to the bath as well .",
    "for instance , the exact solution of the polarizability of a test molecule immersed in water which is also subject to external driving , reveals @xcite that the frequency - dependent response is increased by about @xmath0 as compared to the case when bath - driving is not considered .",
    "moreover , the frequency - dependent response of a semiconducting nanocrystal placed in the vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle and both immersed in a solvent , was shown to be qualitatively altered when bath - driving is included @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the impact of coupling external driving to the environmental modes of driven superconducting tunnel junctions was shown to yield significant contributions @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the way in which time - dependent driving of the harmonic modes of a quantum bath affects the relaxation dynamics of a quantum two - level system .",
    "this constitutes a generalization of the spin - boson model in which an external time - dependent driving force is coupled linearly to the bath . for simplicity , we do not consider an additional direct coupling of the external time - dependent force to the system itself , but focus our attention on the impact of the driven bath .",
    "we show explicitly that the driven bath generates a time - retarded effective force which acts on the two - level system .",
    "we address the relaxation dynamics in the regime of weak system - bath coupling such that the effective dynamics of the central quantum system can be described in terms of a quantum master equation with time - dependent rate coefficients .",
    "specifically , we apply a suitable adiabatic born - markov approximation @xcite which is valid for not too fast driving .",
    "we consider two types of bath spectral densities , the simple structureless ohmic bath and a structured ohmic bath which contains a single pronounced harmonic mode .",
    "the latter is known to be equivalent to a cavity qed setup @xcite .",
    "we calculate the response of the dissipative quantum two - level system to time - dependent bath - driving with a @xmath1-shaped as well as a gaussian - shaped driving pulse .",
    "the effective bath - induced force is given in exact form .",
    "we show that the response of the two - level system to the driven bath is noticeably altered .",
    "for the unstructured ohmic bath , the resonant response of the quantum two - level system decreases in a driven bath as compared to the undriven case .",
    "a qualitatively different response arises when the structured ohmic bath is driven .",
    "additional resonant peaks appear in the response of the system when the external drive matches resonances related to environmental modes .",
    "the present formulation within the general context of quantum dissipation could potentially open up novel pathways to control the dynamics of quantum two - level systems by manipulating their environment through time - dependent control fields .",
    "we consider a model of a quantum mechanical two - level system which is coupled to a linearly driven quantum bath .",
    "the associated total time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath2 is the sum of a system hamiltonian @xmath3 and a bath hamiltonian @xmath4 , along with a part @xmath5 that describes the system - bath coupling .",
    "the new term @xmath6 represents the effect of external time - dependent driving on the bath .",
    "to be specific , we consider in this work a symmetric quantum mechanical two - state system ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the pauli matrices ) with @xmath9 which couples to a bath of harmonic oscillators @xmath10 via @xmath11 with coupling constants @xmath12 .",
    "here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the corresponding annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath15-th bath mode .",
    "the new term describes the coupling of the bath to an external , classical force @xmath16 and is included as @xmath17 where the @xmath18 denote the associated coupling constants .",
    "the driving of each bath mode is assumed to be of dipolar type , coupling to the displacement of the oscillators .",
    "this linear ( or additive ) form of the coupling does not modify the mean square displacements of the oscillators and , thus , does not alter the ( equilibrium ) temperature of the bath which is fixed at the initial time ( see below ) .",

    "as usual @xcite , we characterize the bath by the spectral density @xmath20 with specific forms of @xmath21 given below .",
    "the time dependence of the bath hamiltonian requires some attention in view of the initial condition for the dissipative dynamics .",
    "the most convenient choice is factorizing initial conditions . in this case",
    ", the system is assumed to be initially decoupled from the bath and the coupling is switched on instantaneously at time @xmath22 @xcite . for the time - dependent bath - driving of eq .",

    "figure [ fig-1 ] shows the scheme which we follow throughout this work .",

    "general setup of a pulse - shaped bath drive .",
    "the bath ( b ) is in equilibrium until time @xmath24 , when the bath driving force @xmath16 ( orange and shown as a generic gaussian pulse ) is activated .",
    "subsequently , the bath is driven ( orange stripes ) , with the perturbation centered at some time @xmath32 . at time @xmath33 the system ( s ) is coupled to the driven bath .",

    "bath driving leads to an additional effective force @xmath34 , as shown in this work . ,",
    "due to the additivity of the external driving , it is convenient to address the heisenberg operators @xmath35 of the bath . therefore , we consider the time evolution of each bath operator @xmath13 under the driven bath hamiltonian of eq .",

    "since each bath oscillator is not statically displaced , it follows that @xmath40 has zero average at equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath41 . however , due to eq .",

    "can be performed .",

    "( [ force-2 ] ) is proportional to the identity operator , a simple shift of the heisenberg operator @xmath35 by the average @xmath49 allows us to recover an effective undriven time evolution .",
    "accordingly , the shifted ( heisenberg ) position operator fulfills @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , the bath autocorrelation function @xmath51 and the bath response function @xmath52 remain unchanged compared to their equilibrium form . in particular , we have that @xmath53 @xmath54 \\right\\rangle_{\\rm b}^{\\rm eq } } \\\\   & = \\sum_{j}^{n } c^2_{j}\\ , \\text{sin}(\\omega_j ( t - s ) ) \\text { , } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we use @xmath55 to denote the anticommutator .",
    "these averages over system - bath coupling operators characterize the fluctuations imposed on the system via interaction with the bosonic bath .",

    "the time - dependent bath - induced force then leads to time - dependent rate coefficients in the quantum master equation which can be solved numerically .    to be specific , we considered two types of bath spectral densities , the standard ohmic bath and the structured ohmic bath in which a distinct bath mode has a peaked spectral weight . furthermore , we calculated the bath - induced force for two types of bath - driving , a dirac delta - shaped pulse and a gaussian - shaped pulse .",

    "then , additional resonant peaks appear in the response of the system when the external drive excites the pronounced bath mode .",
