    "since the first discovery of @xmath0-hypernuclei by observing cosmic - rays in emulsion chambers  @xcite , lots of efforts have been devoted to study hypernuclei . using a variety of hypernucleus production reactions and coincidence measurement techniques , data on the single-@xmath0@xcite and double-@xmath0 hypernuclei@xcite",
    "have been accumulated . with the additional degree of freedom of strangeness",
    ", hyperons can penetrate into dense nuclear matter inaccessible to proton and neutron . in astrophysics",
    ", hyperons also play a significant role in the formation and thermal structure evolution of neutron stars@xcite .",
    "prospect for production of neutron halo hypernuclei has been made via @xmath2 reaction  @xcite , which may be helpful to form neutron halo .",
    "on the theoretical side , non - relativistic few - body model and shell model as well as the skyrme - hartree - fock theory have been successfully used to describe single-@xmath0 and double-@xmath0 hypernuclei@xcite . moreover , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory , which was one of the most successful approaches for ordinary nuclei@xcite , has also been applied to describe the structure of nuclei with single-@xmath0 or multi-@xmath0 and other strange baryons systems@xcite .",
    "particularly , with the relativistic continuum hartree - bogoliubov ( rchb ) theory , which has been successfully used to describe the giant halos in exotic zr and ca isotopes@xcite , the hyperon halo in carbon hypernuclei and neutron halo in calcium hypernuclei have been predicted  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the accumulated data of @xmath0 binding energy and spin - orbit splitting , recently the effective @xmath0-nucleon coupling strengths based on the successful effective nucleon - nucleon interaction pk1 have been proposed with microscopic correction for the center - of - mass motion . here the new effective @xmath0-nucleon coupling strengths and calculated results for hypernuclear magnetic moment and spin symmetry in single @xmath1 spectra will be presented and the effect of tensor coupling in @xmath0-hypernuclei as well as the impurity effect of @xmath1 will be discussed in detail .",
    "the starting point of the rmf theory is a standard lagrangian density @xmath3 , in which nucleons are described as dirac particles that interact via the exchange of scalar @xmath4 , vector @xmath5 , and isovector - vector @xmath6 mesons as well as photon  @xcite . for hypernuclei system",
    ", the lagrangian density @xmath3 can be written into two parts , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the standard lagrangian density@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath9 for hyperon @xmath10 ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) is given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of hyperon , and @xmath13 are the coupling strengthes of hyperon and mesons .",
    "the last term in ( [ eq : lag_hyperon ] ) is due to the tensor coupling between hyperon and @xmath5 field , where the field tensor @xmath14 for the @xmath5-meson is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "restricted to mean field and no - sea approximation , following the standard procedure@xcite , one can obtain the equations of motion for baryons ( b ) ( nucleon ( n ) and hyperon ( y ) ) and mesons respectively , i.e. , the dirac and klein - gordon equations .",
    "the dirac equation for the hyperon is ,    @xmath16   \\psi_{y i}(\\bm{r})=\\epsilon_i\\psi_{y i}(\\bm{r } ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the vector potential @xmath17 and scalar potential @xmath18 . for the @xmath5 meson",
    ", the corresponding klein - gordon equation reads , @xmath19 where the baryon current @xmath20 and tensor current @xmath21 have been respectively defined as , @xmath22 more details can be found in ref .",
    "the rmf theory has made great success in the description of ordinary nuclei with an universal effective nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite determined by fitting the nuclear observables such as binding energy , charge radii , etc .",
    "as pk1 is one of the most successful effective nucleon - nucleon interaction , it is natural to extend pk1 for the description of hypernuclei .",
    "for @xmath0-nucleon effective interaction , there are four additional parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the mass of @xmath0 is usually fixed to the experimental value @xmath27 mev . as suggested in ref.@xcite , the tensor @xmath5-@xmath0 is adopted as @xmath28 .",
    "the other two parameters are usually determined by fitting the single-@xmath0 binding energy and /or the spin - orbit splitting .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new effective hyperon - nucleon interaction y1 , based on the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction pk1 , has been developed and labeled as pk1-y1 by fitting the single-@xmath0 binding energies of hypernuclei @xmath29c , @xmath30n , @xmath31o , @xmath32si , @xmath33s , @xmath34ca , @xmath35v , @xmath36y , @xmath37la and @xmath38pb as well as the spin - orbit splittings in @xmath39be and @xmath40c .",
    "the ratio of the meson-@xmath0 coupling strengthes to meson - nucleon ones , i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , thus obtained are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the parameters of effective @xmath0-nucleon interactions pk1-y1 is shown in table  [ table:1 ] in comparison with tm1-b@xcite , nlsh - a , and nlsh - b@xcite .",
    "the root - mean - squared ( rms ) deviation @xmath45 and the relative ones @xmath46 for single-@xmath0 binding energies and the @xmath0 spin - orbit splitting of @xmath47 state in @xmath39be and @xmath40c are also presented , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "[ table:1 ]    figure  [ aba : fig1 ] shows the single-@xmath0 binding energies and spin - orbit splitting sizes for @xmath0 states with different orbital angular momentum obtained from rmf calculations with pk1-y1 effective interaction . in the upper panel ,",
    "good agreement for single-@xmath0 binding energies has been achieved by the theoretical calculations . for the @xmath0 spin - orbit splitting , different from that for nucleon",
    ", the magnitude of around several hundreds kev has been found in the calculation .",
    "the splitting in medium - mass region are relatively larger than those in light- and heavy- mass regions .",
    "with fast development of experimental techniques , the interest in hypernuclear magnetic moments is evoked .",
    "the effects of core polarization and tensor coupling on the magnetic moments in @xmath50c , @xmath51o , and @xmath52ca hypernuclei are studied in the dirac equation with scalar , vector and tensor potentials  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the inclusion of a @xmath0 tensor coupling will modify the current vertex and suppress the effect of core polarization on the magnetic moments . however , as the hyperon wave functions are not sensitive to the @xmath0 tensor potential , the magnetic moments with or without @xmath0 tensor potential are almost the same .",
    "the deviations of magnetic moments for @xmath0 in @xmath47 states from the schmidt values are found to increase with the nuclear mass number .    however , this study is based on the perturbation theory for the symmetric nuclear matter . a self - consistent calculation in finite hypernuclei",
    "is required , in which both the nucleons and hyperon are treated on the same footing .",
    "a self - consistent time - odd triaxial rmf approach  @xcite include the hyperon and the tensor coupling is developed and applied to study the magnetic moments in hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moments of @xmath53@xmath54o by time - odd triaxial rmf approach with pk1 and pk1-y1 are shown in table  [ table:3 ] .",
    "it is found that the core polarization effect of valence @xmath0 is very important although it is smaller than that of the valence neutron .",
    "furthermore , the core polarized dirac magnetic moment might be reduced by the tensor coupling of the valence @xmath0 .",
    "[ table:3 ]",
    "in ref.@xcite , the anti - nucleon spectrum has been studied for ordinary nuclei with the rmf theory and the spin symmetry is found for the single anti - nucleon spectra , i.e. , the spin partner states are nearly degenerate and the dominant components of the wave functions are almost the same .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to examine the spin symmetry in single @xmath55 spectra .    by taking @xmath56 system as the representative case ,",
    "the single @xmath55 spectra and the @xmath55 wave functions were studied in ref.@xcite . in the dirac equation of @xmath55 , the scalar and vector potentials of @xmath55 are written respectively as @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the charge conjugation leaves the scalar potential invariant , @xmath59 , and changes the sign of the vector potential , @xmath60 .    in figure  [ aba : fig2 ]",
    "are shown the spin - orbit splittings @xmath61 of anti - lambda and anti - neutron as functions of the average energy for spin partners in @xmath56 .",
    "the values of splitting for anti - lambda ( @xmath62 mev ) are smaller than those of anti - neutron ( @xmath63 mev ) , which implies that the spin symmetry in anti - lambda spectra is even better conserved than that in anti - neutron spectra .",
    "it is also found that the dominant components of @xmath55 dirac spinors are almost identical for spin partner states .",
    "the self - consistent effects caused by the @xmath55 had not been taken into account in the above calculations . for a real @xmath55-@xmath56 system ,",
    "the self - consistent mean fields including the scalar and vector ones will be modified by the @xmath55 .",
    "further investigation on this issue is in progress .",
    "several aspects about hypernuclei investigated with the relativistic mean field theory , including the effective @xmath0-nucleon coupling strengths based on the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction pk1 , hypernuclear magnetic moment and spin symmetry in @xmath1-hypernuclei have been presented . with the newly - adjusted pk1-y1 effective interaction , the single-@xmath0 binding energies of hypernuclei from light to heavy mass regions",
    "have been well reproduced .",
    "the effects of tensor coupling and core polarization from valence @xmath0 in @xmath0-hypernuclei have been found to be of importance in the description of hypernuclear magnetic moments . the spin symmetry in @xmath55 spectra",
