    "what is _ causality _ ?",
    "| the notion has been defined in different ways and turned out to be highly problematic , both in physics and philosophy .",
    "this observation is not new , as is nicely shown by _",
    "bertrand russell _ s quote  @xcite from more than a century ago : +   _ `` the law of causality [  ]  is a relic of a bygone age , surviving , like the monarchy , only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm . '' _   + indeed , a number of attempts have been made to abandon causality and replace global by only local assumptions ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a particular motivation is given by the difficulty of explaining quantum non - local correlation according to _",
    "reichenbach s principle _  @xcite .",
    "the latter states that in a given ( space - time ) causal structure , correlations stem from _ a common cause _ ( in the common past ) or a _ direct influence _ from one of the events to the other . in the case of violations of bell s inequalities ,",
    "a number of results indicate that explanations through some mechanism as suggested by reichenbach s principle either fail to explain the correlations  @xcite or are unsatisfactory since they require infinite speed  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite or precision  @xcite .",
    "all of this may serve as a motivation for dropping the assumption of a global causal structure in the first place .",
    "closely related to causality is the notion of _ randomness _ : in  @xcite , a piece of information is called _ freely random _ if it is statistically independent from all other pieces of information except the ones in its future light cone .",
    "clearly , when the assumption of an initially given causal structure is dropped , such a definition is not possible any longer .",
    "one may choose to consider freely random pieces of _ information _ as being more fundamental than a space - time structure  | in fact , the latter can then be seen as emerging from the former : if a piece of information is free , then any piece correlated to it is in its causal future . but how can we _ define _ the randomness of an object _ purely intrinsically _ and independently of any context ?    for further motivation , note that colbeck and renner s definition of randomness  @xcite is consistent with full determinism : a random variable with trivial distribution is independent of every other ( even itself ) .",
    "how can we exclude this and additionally ask for the possibility in principle of a counterfactual outcome , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the random variable @xmath0 _ could have taken a value different from the one it actually took _ ? intuitively , this is a necessary condition for _ freeness_. the question whether the universe ( or a _ closed _",
    "system ) starting from a given state @xmath1 always ends up in _ the same _ state @xmath2 seems to be meaningless : even if rewinding were possible , and two runs could be performed , the outcomes @xmath3 and @xmath4 that must be compared never exist in the same reality since rewinding erases the result of the rewound run  @xcite : `` @xmath5 ? '' is _ not a question which can not be answered in principle , but that can not even be formulated precisely_. in summary , defining freeness of a choice or a random event , understood as the _ actual possibility of two ( or more ) well - distinguishable options _",
    ", seems hard even when a causal structure _ is _ in place .",
    "we look for an _ intrinsic _ definition of randomness that takes into account only the `` factuality , '' _",
    "i.e. _ , the state of the closed system in question .",
    "clearly , such a definition is hard to imagine for a single bit , but it _ can _ be defined in a natural way for ( long ) strings of bits , namely its length minus the work value ( normalized through dividing by  @xmath6 ) of a physical representation of the string with respect to some extraction device ; we relate this quantity to the string s `` best compression . ''",
    "we test the alternative view of randomness for physical meaning .",
    "more specifically , we find it to be functional in the context of _ non - local correlations _ : a reasoning yielding a similar mechanism as in the probabilistic regime is realized which has the conceptual advantage not to require relating the outcomes of measurements that can not all actually be carried out .",
    "that mechanism is : random inputs to a non - local system plus no - signaling guarantee random outputs .    in the second half of this text",
    ", we consider consequences of abandoning ( space - time ) causality as being fundamental . in a nutshell",
    ", we put _ logical reversibility _ to the center of our attention here .",
    "we argue that if a computation on a turing machine is logically reversible , then a `` second law '' emerges : the complexity of the tape s content can not decrease in time .",
    "this law holds without failure probability , in contrast to the `` usual '' second law , and implies the latter . in the same spirit",
    ", we propose to define causal relations between physical points , modeled by bit strings , as given by the fact that `` the past is entirely contained in the future , '' _",
    "i.e. _ , nothing is forgotten . in this view",
    ", we also study the relationship between full causality ( which we aim at dropping ) and mere logical consistency ( that we never wish to abandon ) in the complexity view : they are different from each other as soon as more than two parties are involved .",

    "@xcite famous slogan `` information is physical , '' we may want to test our intuition physically : if the @xmath37 bits in a string encode the position , being in the left ( @xmath34 ) as opposed the right ( @xmath35 ) half of some container , of the molecules of a gas , then the @xmath34-string means that the gas is all concentrated in one half and , hence , allows for extracting work from the environmental heat ; the amount is @xmath38 if @xmath39 is boltzmann s constant and  @xmath40 is the temperature of the environment .",
    "this fact has also been called the _ converse of landauer s principle_. note that any other system which can be transformed by a reversible process into that maximally asymmetric gas has the same work value ; an example is a physical representation of the first @xmath37 bits of the binary expansion of @xmath41 of the same length  | although this string may look much more `` random '' at first sight .",
    "this reversible process is , according to the _ church - turing thesis _ , imagined to be carried out by a turing machine in such a way that every step is _ logically reversible _",
    "( such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , a toffoli gate ) and can be _",
    "un_computed by the same device ; the process is then also possible in principle in a _ thermodynamically _ reversible way : no heat is dissipated  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that most @xmath37-bit strings can not have any work value provided there is no _ perpetuum mobile of the second kind_.    for a given string @xmath42 , its _ length minus the work value of a physical representation _ ( divided by @xmath6 ) may be regarded as an intrinsic measure for the _ randomness _ of @xmath42 .",
    "we address the question what in general the fuel value is of ( a physical representation of ) @xmath42 .",
    "since ( the _ reversible _ extraction of ) the string @xmath43 from @xmath42 is equivalent to ( the gain of ) free energy of @xmath38 , we have a first answer : _ work extraction is data compression_.      _ state of the art . _",
    "bennett  @xcite claimed the fuel value of a string @xmath42 to be _ its length minus  @xmath44 _ : @xmath45 bennett s argument is that ( the physical representation of ) @xmath42 can be | logically , hence , thermodynamically  @xcite  | reversibly transformed into the string @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the shortest program for @xmath7 generating @xmath42 and the length of the generated @xmath48 is @xmath49 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "it was already pointed out by zurek  @xcite that whereas it is true that the _ reverse direction _ exists and is _ computable _ by a universal turing machine , its _ forward direction _ , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  @xmath47 from  @xmath42 , is _",
    "not_. this means that the demon that can carry out the work - extraction computation on  @xmath42 from scratch does not physically exist if the church - turing hypothesis is true .",
    "we will see , however , that bennett s value is an _ upper bound _ on the fuel value of @xmath42 .",
    "dahlsten _ et al . _",
    "@xcite follow szilrd  @xcite in putting the _ knowledge _ of the demon extracting the work to the center of their attention .",
    "more precisely , they claim @xmath50 where the `` defect '' @xmath51 is bounded from above and below by a smooth rnyi entropy of the distribution of  @xmath42 from the demon s viewpoint , modeling her ignorance .",
    "they do not consider the algorithmic aspects of the demon s actions extracting the free energy , but the effect of the demon s _ a priori knowledge on @xmath42_. if  we model the demon as an algorithmic apparatus , then we should specify the _",
    "form _ of that knowledge explicitly : vanishing conditional entropy means that  @xmath42 is _ uniquely determined _ from the demon s viewpoint .",
    "does this mean that the demon possesses a _ copy _ of  @xmath42 , or the _ ability _ to produce such a copy , or pieces of _ information _ that uniquely determine  @xmath42 ?",
    "this question sits at the origin of the gap between the two described groups of results ; it is maximal when the demon fully `` knows ''  @xmath42 which , however , still has maximal complexity even given her internal state ( an example see below ) . in  this case , the first result claims @xmath52 to be @xmath34 , whereas @xmath53 according to the second .",
    "the gap vanishes if `` knowing @xmath42 '' is understood in a _ constructive _  | as opposed to entropic  | sense , meaning that `` the demon possesses or can produce a copy of  @xmath42 represented in her internal state : '' if that copy is included in bennett s reasoning , then his result reads @xmath54 in this case , knowledge has immediate work value .    _ the model .",
    "_ we assume the _ demon _ to be a _",

    "the tape contains , at the bit positions initially holding @xmath42 , a ( shorter ) string @xmath47 plus @xmath55 , whereas the rest of the tape is ( again ) the same as before work extraction .",
    "the demon s operations are _ logically _ reversible and can , hence , be carried out _ thermodynamically _ reversibly  @xcite .",
    "logical reversibility in our model is the ability of the same demon to carry out the backward computation step by step , _",
    "i.e. _ , from @xmath56 to  @xmath57 .",
    "we denote by  @xmath58 the _ maximal amount of @xmath34-bits extractable logically reversibly from @xmath42 given the knowledge  @xmath0 _ , _ i.e. _ , @xmath59 if @xmath47 s length is minimal ( see figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .        according to the above , the work value of any physical representation of @xmath42 for a demon knowing  @xmath0  is @xmath60    _ lower bound on the fuel value . _",
    "let @xmath61 be a computable function @xmath62 such that @xmath63 is injective .",
    "we call @xmath61 a _ data - compression algorithm with helper_. then we have @xmath64    this can be seen as follows . first , note that the function @xmath65 is computable and bijective .",
    "given the two ( possibly irreversible ) circuits computing the compression and its inverse , one can obtain a _",
    "reversible _ circuit realizing the function and where no further input or output bits are involved .",
    "this can be achieved by first implementing all logical operations with toffoli gates and uncomputing all junk  @xcite in both of the circuits .",
    "the resulting two circuits have now both still the property that the input is part of the output . as a second step",
    ", we can simply combine the two , where the first circuit s first output becomes the second s second input , and _",
    "vice versa_. roughly speaking , the first circuit computes the compression and the second reversibly uncomputes the raw data .",
    "the combined circuit has only the compressed data ( plus the  0 s ) as output , on the bit positions carrying the input previously .",
    "( the depth of this circuit is roughly the sum of the depths of the two irreversible circuits for the compression and for the decompression , respectively . )",
    "we assume that circuit to be hard - wired in the demon s head .",
    "a  typical example for a compression algorithm that can be used is ziv - lempel  @xcite .    _",
    "upper bound on the fuel value .",
    "_ we have the following upper bound on @xmath58 : @xmath66 the reason is that the demon is only able to carry out the computation in question ( logically , hence , thermodynamically ) reversibly _ if she is able to carry out the reverse computation as well_. therefore , the string @xmath47 must be at least as long as the shortest program for @xmath7 generating  @xmath42 if @xmath0 is given .",
    "although the same is not true in general , this upper bound is _ tight _ if @xmath67 .",
    "the latter means that  @xmath0 itself is a program for generating an additional copy of  @xmath42 .",
    "the demon can then bit - wisely xor this new copy to the original @xmath42 on the tape , hereby producing @xmath68 _ reversibly _ to replace the original  @xmath42 ( at the same time preserving the new one , as reversibility demands ) .",
    "when bennett s `` uncomputing trick '' is used  | allowing for making any computation by a turing machine logically reversible  @xcite  | , then a history string @xmath69 is written to the tape during the computation of @xmath42 from  @xmath0 such that after the xoring , the demon can , going back step by step , _ uncompute _ the generated copy of @xmath42 and end up in the tape s original state  | except that the original  @xmath42 is now replaced by  @xmath68 : this results in a maximal fuel value matching the ( in this case trivial ) upper bound .",
    "note that this harmonizes with  @xcite if vanishing conditional entropy is so established .",
    "_ discussion .",
    "_ we contrast our bounds with the entropy - based results of  @xcite : according to the latter , a demon _ having complete knowledge of @xmath42 _ is able to extract maximal work : @xmath70 . _",

    "it is , however , possible ( c )  that the demon s knowledge is of different nature , merely _ determining @xmath42 uniquely without providing the ability to build @xmath42_. for instance , let the demon s knowledge about @xmath42 be : `` @xmath42 equals the first @xmath37 bits  @xmath71 of the binary expansion of  @xmath72 .

    "( interestingly , on the other hand , the _ non - locality _ of the correlation means that classically speaking , signaling _ would _ be required to _ explain _ the behavior since shared classical information is insufficient . )",
    "according to a result by fine  @xcite , the non - locality of the system ( _ i.e. _ , conditional distribution ) @xmath75 , which means that it can not be written as a convex combination of products @xmath76 , is equivalent to the fact that there exists no `` roof distribution '' @xmath77 such that @xmath78 for all @xmath79 .",

    "we intend to challenge this view .",
    "let us first restate in more precise terms the counterfactual reasoning .",
    "such reasoning is intrinsically assuming or concluding statements of the kind that that some piece of classical information , such as a bit @xmath80 , _ exists _ or _ does not exist_. what does this mean ? _ classicality _ of information is an idealized notion implying that it can be measured without disturbance and that the outcome of a measurement is always the same ( which makes it clear this is an idealized notion requiring the classical bit to be represented in a redundantly extended way over an _",

    "we assume a perfect pr box , _ i.e. _ , a system always satisfying @xmath81 .",
    "note that this equation alone does not uniquely determine @xmath75 since the marginal of  @xmath0 , for instance , is not determined .",
    "if , however , we additionally require _ no - signaling _ , then the marginals , such as @xmath82 or @xmath83 , must be perfectly unbiased under the assumption that all four @xmath84-combinations , _ i.e. _ , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , are possible . to see this ,",
    "assume on the contrary that @xmath87 . by the pr condition",

    ", we also have @xmath89 . using symmetry , and no - signaling again",

    "this contradicts the pr condition   since _ two bits which are both biased towards  @xmath34 can not differ with certainty_. therefore , our original assumption was wrong : the outputs _ must _ be perfectly unbiased .",

    "the second consequence is that the causal relations that stem from certain strings can describe _ non - causal _ scenarios .",
    "this means that _ logical consistency _ does not imply a causal scenario : _ causality is strictly stronger than logical consistency . _",
    "whereas for _ parmenides of elea _ , time was a mere illusion  | `` no was nor will , all past and future null ''  | , _ heraclitus _ saw space - time as the pre - set stage on which his play of permanent change starts and ends .",
    "the follow - up debate  | two millennia later and three centuries ago  | between _ newton _ and _ leibniz _ about as how fundamental space and time , hence , _ causality _ , are to be seen was decided by the course of science in favor of newton : in this view , space and time can be imagined as fundamental and given _ a priori_. ( this applies also to relativity theory , where space and time get intertwined and dynamic but remain fundamental instead of becoming purely relational in the sense of _ mach s principle_. ) today , we have more reason to question a fundamental causal structure  | such as the difficulty of explaining quantum non - local correlations according to reichenbach s principle .",
    "so motivated , we care to test refraining from assuming space - time as initially given ; this has a number of consequences and implications , some of which we address in this text .    when causality is dropped , the usual definitions of randomness stop making sense . motivated by this ,",
    "we test the use of intrinsic , context - independent `` randomness '' measures such as a string s length minus its ( normalized ) fuel value .",
    "we show that under the church - turing hypothesis , kolmogorov complexity relates to this value .",
    "we argue that with respect to quantum non - locality , complexity allows for a reasoning that avoids comparing results of different measurements that can not all be actually carried out , _",
    "i.e. _ , that is _ not counterfactual_. some may see this as a conceptual simplification .",
    "it also leads to an all - or - nothing flavor of the church - turing hypothesis : _ either no physical system can generate uncomputable sequences , or even a single photon can_. finally , it is asked whether _",
    "logical reversibility _ is connected to the second law of thermodynamics  | interpreted here in complexities and independent of any context expressed through probabilities or ensembles  | and potentially to the arrow of time , past and future .",
    "finally , we have speculated that if a causal structure is not fundamental , how it may emerge from data - compressibility relations .    when causality is dropped , one risks antinomies .",
    "we show , in the complexity - based view , that sticking to logical consistency does not restore causality but is strictly weaker .",
