    "despite decades of continuing effort , the progenitor systems of type ia supernovae ( sne ) have not been confidently identified yet ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this has become one of the most pressing problems in stellar evolution , with profound implications for cosmology and the chemical evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "it has been known for some time that type ia sne are the result of the thermonuclear explosion of a c+o white dwarf ( wd ) that is destabilized by accretion of matter from a companion in a close binary system @xcite , but the details of this process are still the subject of heated debate . in particular , the nature of the companion and the physical processes involved in the evolution of the binary prior to explosion remain obscure .",
    "most of the discussions on type ia progenitor systems are held in the framework of two basic scenarios . in the so - called single degenerate ( sd )",
    "scenario , the wd companion is a normal or slightly evolved star . in the double degenerate ( dd )",
    "scenario , it is another wd . in the sd scenario , the wd might explode either close to the chandrasekhar limit ( sd - ch ) or some time before reaching it ( sub - chandrasekhar explosions , sd - subch ) .",
    "several observational and theoretical arguments point at sd - ch explosions as the most promising route to type ia sne , but there are still many uncertainties associated with this paradigm ( for discussions , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main problem is the necessity to bring the mass of the c+o wd close enough to the chandrasekhar limit to trigger the explosion . at the onset of the final mass transfer episode in sd systems ,",
    "the wd mass is thought to lie between 0.7 @xmath1 @xcite and 1.2 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this means that , in order to achieve the @xmath2 necessary for a thermonuclear runaway , the wd needs to accrete between 0.2 and 0.7 @xmath1 of material from its companion and then burn it somehow to c and o avoiding the highly unstable degenerate conditions at the wd surface .",
    "our present understanding of type ia sne in the sd - ch scenario is based on theoretical models that attempt to explain the details of these accretion and burning processes .",
    "one key aspect of such models is the presence or absence of outflows from the binary system during its pre - sn evolution .",
    "if these outflows are indeed present , they should leave some kind of imprint on the circumstellar medium ( csm ) of the progenitor , but the evidence for this modified csm in type ia sn observations remains inconclusive .",
    "prompt emission at radio or x - ray wavelengths from the interaction of sn ejecta with surrounding material , which has been found in several core collapse sne , appears to be absent in type ia events . in the radio ,",

    "modification of the csm on larger scales will become apparent in the aftermath of the explosion , during the supernova remnant ( snr ) phase . in @xcite ( henceforth bb01 )",
    ", we conducted a preliminary search for the imprint of presupernova outflows on the dynamics of young type ia snrs . in the present work",
    ", we expand and revise the calculations presented in bb01 , and we perform a more detailed and robust comparison to the observations of snrs .",
    "our aim is to use these comparisons as a means to constrain the fundamental properties of the presupernova outflows and gain insights on the nature of the progenitor systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we examine the outflow mechanisms from type ia progenitors in the sd - ch channel , and we build simple models to mimic them (   [ sec : outflows ] ) . from these outflow models ,",
    "we simulate the structure of the csm around the progenitor system at the time of the sn explosion (   [ sec : csm ] ) and the subsequent evolution of the snr (   [ sec : dynamics - snr ] ) . in   [ sec : comp - with - obs - snrs ] , we compare our snr models with the known properties of the forward shock dynamics and x - ray emission in a sample of known type ia snrs . finally , we discuss our results in   [ sec : discussion ] and we summarize them in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "there are two channels by which a sd binary system can lead to a type ia sn . the systems in the first channel consist of a wd and a main sequence ( ms ) or slightly evolved companion star ( wd+ms channel , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mass transfer occurs via roche lobe overflow , which requires that the two components be very close , with an initial period of the order of days . a different class of type ia progenitors systems is composed of a wd and a red giant ( rg ) star with a wider separation and a longer initial period , of the order of a hundred days ( wd+rg channel , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mechanism for mass transfer in these more detached systems is not well understood , but roche lobe overflow might still play a significant role .",
    "the details of the evolution of type ia progenitor systems in these two channels are very complex .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the process of mass transfer affects both the orbital parameters of the system and the evolution of the components , which in turn modify the conditions for the mass transfer . in the most",
    "widely accepted picture for sd type ia progenitors , the h- or he - rich material from the donor star forms an accretion disk and then accumulates in a shell on top of the wd . given the appropriate conditions , nuclear burning in this shell converts the accreted material to c and o , until the mass of the wd reaches @xmath6 .",
    "at this point , a runaway thermonuclear flame ignites in the central regions of the wd , and a type ia sn explosion ensues .",
    "it is important to stress that a sn explosion is only one of the many possible outcomes of the evolution of close binary systems that contain a wd .",
    "the key parameter that determines whether a specific binary system leads to a type ia sn or not is the accretion rate of the wd , @xmath7 .    for accretion rates below a critical limit @xmath8 , nuclear burning on the surface of the degenerate",
    "wd is unstable @xcite . , but see @xcite ] the value of @xmath8 depends on the mass of the wd @xcite , on the metallicity of the accreted material @xcite , and on the rotation of the wd @xcite , but it is generally assumed to be of the order of @xmath9 . if @xmath7 is only slightly lower than @xmath8 , nuclear burning proceeds cyclically in weak flashes , and most of the accumulated material might be retained by the wd @xcite .",
    "recurrent novae like rs oph or u sco are thought to be the observational counterparts of white dwarf binaries accreting in this regime @xcite . for even lower values of @xmath7 , however , the flashes become stronger , effectively turning into nova explosions that erode the wd @xcite .",
    "if the accretion enters this regime , the wd mass effectively decreases with time and the system can not produce a type ia sn ( see fig . 5 in * ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    at higher accretion rates ,",
    "the energy input from the shell nuclear burning can lead to the expansion of the outer layers of the wd to red giant dimensions @xcite .",
    "this occurs when @xmath7 approaches the nuclear eddington - accretion rate @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the eddington luminosity of the wd , and @xmath12 is the energy gained by fusing h into he . for a wd of one solar mass , @xmath13 . upon expansion of the wd",
    ", the binary system may enter a common envelope phase , which might lead to a spiral - in ( due to dynamical friction ) and the merging of both components @xcite . for a long time",
    ", it was thought that this would prevent many sd systems from becoming type ia progenitors , but @xcite ( henceforth , hkn96 ) proposed a mechanism to avoid the common envelope phase . these authors claimed that , for high values of @xmath7 , the luminosity from the shell nuclear burning can drive an optically thick ` accretion wind ' outflow from the wd surface with an outflow mass loss rate @xmath14 such that the effective value of @xmath7 remains below @xmath15 .",
    "this accretion wind results in the loss of material from the binary system .      in recent times ,",
    "most of the models for sd type ia sn progenitors have relied to a greater or lesser extent on the accretion wind mechanism of hkn96 as a means to limit the effective value of @xmath7 .",
    "this is despite the fact that several fundamental aspects of the accretion wind mechanism are not well understood . in particular , some kind of self - regulation is required so that @xmath7 falls below @xmath15 ( to avoid the expansion of the wd ) , but at the same time remains very close to this critical value ( in order for the wd to gain enough mass to explode as a type ia sn ) .",
    "furthermore , the accretion wind is supposed to remain active up to mass transfer rates of the order of the eddington accretion rate @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the specific potential energy gained by accreting matter onto a wd with radius @xmath18 . in this situation , @xmath19 , which implies , for wind velocities similar to the wd escape velocity ( see   [ sub : outflows - theory ] ) , a ratio of wind - to - photon momentum of @xmath20 .",
    "it is known that winds driven by photon scattering in lines can not work in this regime @xcite . in principle",
    ", continuum - driven winds might reach such high efficiencies , as claimed by hkn96 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this has never been proved with detailed simulations . due to these and other concerns ,",
    "the role that accretion winds play in the presupernova evolution of type ia progenitors remains controversial .",
    "some authors claim that this mechanism can not work in a realistic scenario , and that h - accreting wds can not explode as type ia sne @xcite .      following the work of hkn96",
    ", @xcite explored several specific cases within the wd+ms channel , making use of analytical formulae to follow the evolution of the binary system parameters and mass transfer rates .",
    "in a companion paper , @xcite applied the same techniques to systems in the wd+rg channel . in these papers ,",
    "substantial outflows from the type ia progenitors were found in all cases .",
    "the typical timescales for the outflows are several times @xmath21 yr , with mass loss rates @xmath14 of the order of @xmath22 . in some binary systems ,",
    "the wd explodes as a type ia sn while the optically thick accretion wind is still active .",
    "in other cases , the outflow stops some time before the explosion , leading to a more or less extended mass - conservative phase .",
    "other studies have followed the evolution of binary systems with accretion winds , relying on stellar evolution codes instead of the analytical formulae used by @xcite .",
    "this kind of calculation is necessary in order to estimate the mass - transfer rates in the system correctly . in general , stellar evolution codes predict lower values of @xmath14 and hence longer evolutionary timescales than those obtained using analytical formulae .",
    "the first such study was published by @xcite , but a more detailed and updated exploration of the parameter space ( with @xmath23 binary systems ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "these works have in common that they found substantial outflows from the type ia progenitors in all cases . in contrast",
    ", @xcite only found outflows in about one third of the progenitor systems of solar metallicity that they simulated .",
    "this is due to more optimistic assumptions concerning the mass accumulation efficiency in accreting wds , which might be justified by models that include the effect of rotation @xcite .",
    "it is also important to mention that @xcite stopped their simulations for systems which required outflows with @xmath24 .    in the theoretical framework laid down by hkn96",
    ", accretion winds are formed in the wd envelope with photospheric velocities of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "these high outflow velocities are necessary because the escape velocity from the surface of the wd is also very high ( roughly of the same order of magnitude , see figure 4 and accompanying discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the orbital velocities in type ia progenitor systems are much lower than this , of the order of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "it is useful to compare the theoretical accretion wind models described in the previous section to the observations of binary systems that have been proposed as type ia progenitor candidates .",
    "the list of candidate objects is very heterogeneous , and includes transient supersoft x - ray sources like rx j0513.9 - 6951 @xcite , eclipsing binaries with intermittent x - ray emission like v sagittae @xcite , and recurrent novae like rs oph @xcite and u sco @xcite .    among these objects , rxj0513.9 - 6951 and",
    "v sagittae are of particular interest , because they have non - explosive outflows that can be modeled using the accretion wind mechanism @xcite . in the case of rxj0513.9 - 6951",
    ", the outflows have a velocity of @xmath27 , with strong hints of a bipolar structure @xcite .",
    "the outflows from v sagittae are more complex , but a high velocity component at @xmath28 also appears to be present @xcite .",
    "these high outflow velocities support the theoretical values discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is interesting to note that both systems are variable sources at optical and x - ray wavelengths , with periods of the order of a few hundred days . @xcite",
    "attribute the variability of rxj0513.9 - 6951 to the impact of the strong ( @xmath29 ) accretion winds from the wd atmosphere on the surface of the donor star , whose outer envelope is stripped off , temporarily shutting down the accretion process and interrupting the accretion wind itself .",
    "the same authors propose a somewhat similar model for v sagittae , but it is unclear whether this kind of variability should be ubiquitous among binary systems with accretion winds .      based on the theoretical studies described in ",
    "[ sub : outflows - theory ] , we have produced several models for the outflows from type ia sn progenitor systems .",
    "the temporal evolution of the outflow mass loss rate @xmath14 is shown in figure [ fig-1 ] , and the fundamental properties of the models are listed in table [ tab-1 ] .",
    "model h1 mimics the mass loss of the example system discussed in   3.5 of @xcite ( see their fig",
    "model lv1 is built after the example in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "models hp1 , hp2 , and hp3 are approximations to the outflows from the three representative type ia progenitor systems discussed in   3 of @xcite ( fig .",

    "these outflow models are chosen as representative examples of the typical evolution of type ia progenitors of solar metallicity . with them , we expand and improve on the work presented in bb01 , aiming at a more complete exploration of the parameter space for type ia progenitor systems .",
    "our outflow models are evidently very simplified , but we believe that they capture the essence of the relationship established between the current models for type ia progenitor systems and the csm ( a more detailed discussion of some of the issues concerning the outflow models is deferred to   [ sub : discuss - initial_models ] ) .",
    "we note that , although we have sampled binary system calculations with different initial conditions and from different authors , the time scales and mass loss rates of all the outflows are very similar , and should shape the csm and influence the evolution of the snrs in a similar way .",
    "we have performed hydrodynamic simulations to calculate the impact that the outflow models presented in   [ sub : outflows - models - outflows ] would have on the structure of the csm around the type ia progenitors at the time of the sn explosion . for this purpose ,",
    "we have used vh-1 , a numerical hydrodynamics code developed at the university of virginia by john hawley , john blondin and collaborators .",
    "vh-1 is based on the piecewise parabolic method of @xcite , and the code has been extensively tested and validated in multiple astrophysical scenarios . for the timescales and velocities involved in the outflows from type ia sn progenitors ,",

    "the results of later works appear to agree with the type ia hypothesis in the case of 0509 - 67.5 @xcite and n103b @xcite , but there are no detailed models in the literature that can confirm this .",

    "all the angular radii listed in table [ tab-3 ] are from _ chandra _ observations except that of sn 1885 , which is from the absorption features seen in _",
    "images @xcite .",
    "the x - ray radii are very precise : even in the lmc snrs , the _ chandra _ psf will only introduce errors below @xmath72 . the value of @xmath70 is known with some accuracy for the lmc snrs @xcite and for sn 1885 @xcite , but it can be very uncertain in the galactic snrs .",
    "the fs velocities are obtained from the study of the narrow and broad components of the h@xmath73 emission in non - radiative shocks @xcite .",
    "the derivation of @xmath74 from the width of the broad h@xmath73 component is not straightforward , and it requires some modeling of the plasma physics at the shock .",
    "it is important to note that the fs velocities are obtained at specific points in the blast wave ( usually those that offer the best signal to noise ratio in h@xmath73 ) , and may not be representative of the dynamics of the entire snr .",
    "furthermore , @xcite recently expressed concern that the current models might be underestimating the shock velocities from the h@xmath73 observations .",
    "for these reasons , the values of @xmath74 listed in table [ tab-3 ] need to be considered with caution .",
    "we have used the average ionization timescale @xmath75 of fe and si to represent the ionization state of these elements in the shocked ejecta of our snrs . in order to assemble a consistent set of values and constrain the uncertainties in the best possible way ,",
    "we have determined the ionization timescales listed in table [ tab-4 ] from archival _ chandra _ observations of our snr sample .",
    "the methods and techniques that we have used for this purpose are detailed in appendix [ sec : ioniz - timesc - shock ] .      before attempting a comparison between the dynamics of the fs in our snr models and the observed values",
    ", we must emphasize that our calculations do not include the effect of efficient shock acceleration of cosmic rays .",
    "this process is known to take part in many young snrs , and recent theoretical @xcite and observational @xcite works have shown that it can have a noticeable impact on the internal structure and x - ray emission of the snr , specially in the shocked ism .",
    "the impact on the dynamics of the fs , however , is modest : at an age of 5000 yr , the values of @xmath68 and @xmath74 in a snr that is accelerating cosmic rays efficiently are only @xmath76 lower than in a test particle case ( see fig . 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "this kind of deviation is inconsequential for the order of magnitude comparisons that we carry out in the present section .",
    "the values of @xmath68 and @xmath74 in our snr models are plotted alongside the observations in figures [ fig-6 ] and [ fig-7 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig-6 ] , we display the values obtained for the interaction between the explosion model pdde and the csm profiles hp3 and l2 from figure [ fig-3 ] , together with a set of snr models generated with a uniform ism .",
    "for the uniform ism interaction , we have represented the parameter space obtained by varying @xmath33 as a dashed region between two limiting cases , @xmath77 ( top plots ) and @xmath78 ( bottom plots ) , which encompass the typical conditions in the warm atomic phase of the ism .",
    "the snr models evolving inside the hp3 and l2 csm profiles are clearly unable to reproduce the observed values of @xmath68 , but most of the data points cluster nicely around the uniform ism models .",
    "the only exception is sn 1006 , whose large size is compatible with both a very low density ism and the csm cavity from model hp3 .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for the fs velocities . while it is clear that the snr models evolving inside the csm cavities can be confidently discarded , it seems that the models interacting with a uniform ism also overpredict the values of @xmath74 , again with the only exception of sn 1006 .",
    "the distribution of the data points for kepler , tycho , 0509 - 67.5 and 0519 - 69.0 suggests a systematic shift of a factor @xmath79 between the values of @xmath74 predicted by modeling the h@xmath73 emission of the fs and the models with an ism interaction",
    ". this could be the hallmark of the effect discussed by @xcite , or a selection effect towards localizations in the fs with higher densities imposed by the statistics of the h@xmath73 observations , but more complex explanations can not be discarded without a detailed analysis .    in figure",
    "[ fig-7 ] , we repeat the comparison , this time for snrs evolving into the cavities obtained with the modified values of @xmath32 . from the point of view of the fs dynamics alone , the csm structures produced by outflows in the slow regime are hard to distinguish from a uniform ism interaction .",
    "this is specially true for the collapsed cavities of models l2u1e6 and l2u1e7 and the small rb of model hp3u1e6 .",
    "the energy - driven cavities of models hp3u2e7 and l2u2e7 , on the other hand , are hard to reconcile with the observations of all snrs except sn 1006 .",
    "the size of these two cavities is coincidentally similar to the radius of sn 1006 , so that the fs is hitting the shell at @xmath47 for a snr age of @xmath80 yr .",
    "this results in a good match to the present value of @xmath74 in sn 1006 , but in a regime where the fs is undergoing a very rapid deceleration as it overcomes the radiatively cooled shell ( dash - dotted plots in figure [ fig-7 ] ) .",
    "if this was indeed the situation , one would expect to see a radiative fs with a very low expansion parameter in sn 1006 , instead of the observed nonradiative fs @xcite with an expansion parameter of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section noting that there is evidence for some kind of csm interaction in at least two of the objects in our sample , kepler @xcite and n103b @xcite .",
    "the fact that this is not clearly revealed by the values of @xmath68 and @xmath74 listed in table [ tab-3 ] emphasizes the importance that hydrodynamic models of individual snrs will have in order to take these comparisons to the next level of detail .      in figures [ fig-8 ] and [ fig-9 ]",

    "* ) . in spite of this",
    ", we find that qualitative comparisons of ionization timescales are highly informative , and more than sufficient for our present needs .    in figure [ fig-8 ] , we present the temporal evolution of @xmath82 for si and fe in the snr models obtained from the interaction of model pdde with the csm profiles hp3 and l2 , and with a uniform ism . for the uniform ism case",

    "we have scaled @xmath82 with @xmath33 using the approximate relations given in   2.3 of @xcite . once again , the data points cluster around the models with a uniform ism interaction , albeit with more dispersion than in the @xmath68 plots .",
    "the inconsistency between the snr models evolving inside low - density cavities and the observations is even more dramatic than for the fs dynamics .",
    "there is simply not enough mass in the csm models hp3 and l2 that the sn ejecta can react to in order to reach the ionization timescales observed in type ia snrs .    in figure",
    "[ fig-9 ] , we repeat the comparison using the csm profiles obtained with the modified values of @xmath32 . as expected , the csm profiles generated by outflows in the slow regime lead to a stronger interaction with the sn ejecta and higher ionization timescales for fe and si .",
    "this is specially true for models hp3u1e6 and l2u1e6 , which have prominent shells of radiatively cooled material close to the sn progenitor . in these models ,",
    "some ejecta layers undergo catastrophic cooling early on the evolution of the snr .",
    "models hp3u1e7 and l2u1e7 do not lead to such extreme interaction , and are in general hard to distinguish from a uniform ism .",
    "as soon as the outflows enter the fast regime , however , the situation changes radically . only the shocked ejecta emission of sn 1006 , with its low si @xmath83 and absence of fe , is compatible with the csm cavities hp3u2e7 and l2u2e7 , but these models",
    "have already been discarded in ",
    "[ sub : forw - shock - dynam : modvsobs ] for other reasons .",
    "in   [ sec : csm ] , we have seen that the accretion wind outflows invoked by current type ia progenitor models in the sd channel will excavate large cavities in the ism . in   [ sec : comp - with - obs - snrs ] , we have shown that the fundamental properties of the seven type ia snrs in our sample are incompatible with snr models that expand into such large cavities .",
    "can these two results be connected with enough confidence to draw conclusions on type ia sn progenitor models based on the snr observations ? in this section , we review the potential issues that might affect the initial models , the simulations , and the observational sample , and we briefly discuss the implications of our results for the observations of type ia sne .",
    "the outflow models presented in figure [ fig-1 ] and table [ tab-1 ] make two important approximations : they are isotropic ( i.e. , spherically symmetric ) in space and continuous in time . in a more realistic scenario ,",
    "the presence of the donor star and the accretion disk , and the spin - up of the wd to high angular velocities @xcite should introduce some sort of bipolarity in the outflows . as we have seen in ",
    "[ sub : outflows - observations ] , the observations of type ia sn progenitor candidates show some evidence of this bipolarity .",
    "continuous bipolar outflows may lead to a bipolar csm structure similar to some planetary nebulae @xcite , but this does not seem likely for the objects in our sample .",
    "only moderate one - sided asymmetries are apparent in kepler and n103b , and most other objects ( in particular , tycho , sn 1006 , and 0509 - 67.5 ) are nearly spherical .",
    "setting aside the spatial structure of the outflows from type ia sn progenitors , their temporal evolution will not be as simple as the plots shown in figure [ fig-1 ] . in order to reach the values of @xmath7 that allow for the growth of the wd",
    ", the mass transfer rate has to cross the instability region below @xmath8 , where more or less frequent nova outbursts are expected .",
    "@xcite , for instance , found a long ( @xmath84 ) switch - on phase of the mass transfer in all their binary systems that was dominated by instabilities .",
    "nova - like outbursts could also appear during the mass - conservative phase between the cessation of the accretion wind and the sn explosion @xcite .",
    "judging from the observations of rxj0513.9 - 6951 and v sagittae discussed in ",
    "[ sub : outflows - observations ] , a steady accretion wind might be impossible or happen only in a few cases . if the episodic outflows in type ia progenitors have periodicities of @xmath85 days , as in these two systems , several million cycles should take place through the accretion phase , and the outflows might smear out to become indistinguishable from a continuous wind . in the case of recurrent novae ,",
    "the individual outbursts will be more spaced out , leading to a complex csm structure , with several shells that brighten up as they are overtaken by the fs . again",
    ", there is no evidence for this in any of the objects that we have studied , but more detailed hydrodynamic calculations would be necessary to confirm or discard any given scenario .",
    "there are two ways to prevent type ia progenitor outflows from leaving large cavities in the csm : either the value of @xmath32 is decreased below the critical limit @xmath39 or the cavities are somehow destroyed before the sn explodes . as we have shown in ",
    "[ sec : comp - with - obs - snrs ] , outflows in the slow regime ( @xmath86 ) lead to csm structures that are hard to distinguish from a uniform ism interaction .",
    "however , outflows emanating from the wd surface _ should _ have much higher velocities , of the order of the escape velocity ( @xmath87 , a value that is supported by the observations cited in   [ sub : outflows - observations ] ) .",
    "some of the kinetic energy of the outflows will be lost in overcoming the potential well of the system , but it is unlikely that this can reduce @xmath32 by an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the presence of slow outflows around the progenitor systems is difficult to reconcile with the lack of csm detections in type ia sne ( see   [ sub : discuss - comp - with - obs - sne ] ) .    if large cavities do form , it is hard to find a non - catastrophic process that could destroy them before @xmath49 .",
    "thermal conduction , for instance , which must be active to some extent at the interface between the hot shocked outflow and the radiatively cooled shell , could not wipe out cavities with a radius of @xmath88 cm , even over timescales of @xmath46 yr . in the example presented in ",
    "iv of @xcite , which is based on an interstellar bubble very similar to our models , the conduction front behind the cool shell only spans a small fraction of the cavity radius . the density inside the cavity increases due to evaporation of material from the shell , but it remains orders of magnitude below the surrounding ism .",
    "a final possibility is that the binary system forms a cavity , and then leaves it behind as it moves with respect to the ism .",
    "large speeds are not expected in sd type ia progenitors , but even at the mean random velocity of @xmath89 ( characteristic of the solar neighborhood , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) a star can move @xmath88 cm in @xmath90 yr .",
    "still , only moving systems with an extended mass conservative phase before the sn explosion could leave their cavities completely behind . in moving progenitors with active outflows at @xmath49",
    ", the explosion would happen off - center , but the cavity would still be there , and therefore the impact on the fs dynamics and the x - ray emission of the snr would still be strong @xcite .",
    "we have omitted from our study several snrs whose x - ray spectra suggest a type ia origin , but whose ages can only be roughly estimated from the fs dynamics .",
    "examples include g337.2 - 0.7 and g299.2 - 2.9 in the galaxy @xcite , and dem l71 , dem l238 , and dem l249 in the lmc @xcite .",
    "these are rather old objects , and nothing in their morphology or x - ray emission indicates that they might be expanding inside a large wind - blown cavity , but clues for other kinds of csm interaction might be revealed by detailed models .",
    "it is also possible that young type ia snrs expanding inside large cavities _ do _ exist , but have not been identified yet .",
    "these objects would have a large radius and a faint x - ray emission , so they would be hard to classify as type ia snrs .",
    "one such object might be the galactic snr rcw 86 , which has a large size ( @xmath91 ) and fe - rich sn ejecta @xcite .",
    "this snr has been associated with the supernova of ad 185 @xcite , but this association remains controversial , and its type ia origin is uncertain . if we ignore these concerns , and take the value of @xmath92 kpc given by @xcite , we find @xmath93 at an age of 1821 yr , about 30 @xmath94 larger than model pdde+l2 , but certainly within the correct order of magnitude .",
    "recent values for the fs velocity ( @xmath95 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ionization timescale of the shocked ejecta ( @xmath96 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are much closer to our cavity models pdde+hp3 and pdde+l2 than those of the snrs in our sample .",
    "in fact , @xcite already suggested that rcw 86 might be evolving inside a low - density cavity based on early _ asca _ observations .",
    "if the explosion type and the association with sn 185 are confirmed for rcw 86 , it would be very interesting to explore the possibility of an accretion wind outflow as the origin of the csm structure .",
    "another galactic snr with fe - rich ejecta that might be expanding into a csm cavity is w49b @xcite , but in this case there is no reliable age estimate that can be used to constrain the dynamics .",
    "although this paper focuses on the impact that the outflows from type ia progenitors have on the dynamics and x - ray emission of snrs , here we will briefly discuss the implications for observations of type ia sne . the lack of prompt emission at x - ray and radio wavelengths ( *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and other references listed in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) , as well as the absence of low velocity ( narrow ) lines from h in the early or late spectra of normal events @xcite suggest that the amount of circumstellar material in the immediate vicinity of type ia progenitors must be low @xcite .",
    "the upper limits on the radio and x - ray fluxes have been used to derive estimates for the mass loss rate of the progenitor system outflows @xmath14 , but these observations can only constrain the quotient @xmath97 . if the outflows are fast , this technique does not provide much information about @xmath14 : the radio fluxes of @xcite translate into @xmath98 for @xmath99 , which is compatible with all but the most extreme of accretion winds . for slower outflows ,",
    "the upper limits on @xmath14 go down linearly with @xmath32 .",
    "an interesting possibility , suggested by @xcite , is that episodic outflows just before the explosion might clear out a more or less extended region around the progenitor system , thus explaining the lack of prompt emission and h - rich material .",
    "however , we have shown that this region can not be so large that the dynamic evolution of the snr is severely affected , at least in the seven objects that we have studied . at the same time , evidence for large csm structures around _",
    "some _ type ia progenitors has appeared in the form of the light echoes detected in three objects : sn 1991 t , sn1995e and sn 1998bu .",
    "these echoes have been interpreted by @xcite as reflected light from detached shells or sheets of dust at distances ranging between 50 and 200 pc from the sn .",
    "if this interpretation is correct ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a complete discussion of the ambiguities involved ) , the detached structures in these three objects might be the radiatively cooled shells around accretion wind - blown bubbles .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the relationship between the sd progenitor systems of type ia sne and their surroundings , focusing on the effects that the outflows from these systems would have on the structure of the csm and on the dynamics and x - ray emission of the snrs that evolve after the explosion .",
    "we have seen that the optically thick accretion winds from the wd surface invoked by current type ia progenitor models will excavate large cavities in the ism , provided that the outflows stay in the fast regime ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "we have shown that the fundamental properties of the seven young type ia snrs in our sample ( sn 1885 , kepler , tycho , sn 1006 , 0509 - 67.5 , 0519 - 69.0 , and n103b ) are incompatible with snr models that expand into such large cavities . in fact , we found that all these objects can be explained by a uniform ism interaction at the level of detail allowed by our simulations . at the same time",
    ", we can not discard the existence of a population of young type ia snrs expanding into low - density cavities excavated by accretion wind outflows .",
    "the properties of these objects ( large size and low brightness ) would make them hard to detect and , if detected , very difficult to identify as the remnants of type ia explosions .",
    "the galactic snr rcw 86 might be such an object , but more detailed work is needed to confirm this intriguing possibility .",
    "the presence of outflows from the progenitors of the seven snrs that we have examined can not be completely discarded , but the properties of these outflows ( mass - loss rates , timescales and velocities ) must be very different from those of the accretion winds described by hkn96 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether outflows with substantially lower values of @xmath14 or @xmath32 would be capable of limiting the effective accretion rate of the wd and prevent a common envelope phase in single degenerate type ia progenitors .",
    "another possibility is that accretion wind outflows are not always present in these systems - for instance , if the rotation of the wd increases the accretion efficiency to the point that only a small fraction of systems present significant outflows , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a reminder that the viability of sd systems as type ia progenitors has not been proved yet .",
    "several studies have pointed out the difficulties in driving a h - accreting wd close enough to the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .",
    "if the star found by @xcite in the tycho snr is indeed the runaway companion of the wd that exploded in 1572 , this means that at least one of the objects in our sample must have had a sd progenitor . the obvious alternative ( dd systems )",
    "is plagued by its own problems , and it is still unclear whether wd mergers can lead to healthy explosions @xcite .",
    "the fact remains that we lack a clear picture of the binary evolution leading to type ia sne .",

    "together with the electron temperature @xmath101 , the ionization timescale or fluence ( @xmath83 ) is a fundamental quantity used to characterize the thermal emission in nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasmas .",
    "these two parameters are the most common end product of fitting the thermal component of the x - ray emission in snrs .",
    "however , the values of @xmath101 and @xmath83 obtained in a particular spectral fit are model dependent , and can be affected by uncertainties in the atomic data and other factors ( for discussions , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most popular tools for spectral analysis of the thermal emission in snrs are the plane - parallel shock models with adjustable abundances , but even these sophisticated spectral models contain fundamental simplifications whose impact on the fitted parameters is unclear , like the assumption of a homogeneous chemical composition or the plane shock geometry . in general , it can be said that the systematic uncertainties associated with plane - parallel shock fits are much larger ( and much harder to estimate ) than the statistical ones .    in order to minimize these sources of error and determine values of @xmath83 in different snrs that can be compared to each other ( and to the models ) with some confidence",
    ", we have downloaded archival _",
    "observations for the objects in our sample , and we have fitted them with the same procedure .",
    "we used the plane - parallel shock models described in @xcite for the thermal component and a power law to describe the nonthermal continuum , both of which were absorbed by an intervening column of galactic interstellar matter assumed to be of solar composition . during the fits , the galactic column density was fixed to a value determined from the entire _ chandra _ spectrum . to minimize the errors related to atomic data , we concentrated on the k - shell lines from the most abundant elements ( spectra above 1.5 kev ) .",
    "this has the advantage of reducing the impact of uncertainties in the absorption as well . in fits to the 1.55 kev band ( ` si component ' ) we included emission from si , s ,",
    "ar , and ca , all with the same @xmath101 and @xmath83 .",
    "the relative abundances of these species were allowed to vary during the fit , as were the index and normaliztaion of the power - law .",
    "independent fits were done to the 510 kev band around the fe k blend ( ` fe component ' ) . only fe and the power - law continuum ( plus fixed absorption ) were included in the fe fits .",
    "the best - fit models for each snr in both bands can be seen in figure [ fig-10 ] .",
    "the relationship between the two fundamental quantities @xmath83 and @xmath101 in these fits is of particular interest .",
    "plane - parallel shock models implicitly rely on the thermal continuum to constrain @xmath101 and the line emission to constrain @xmath83 .",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray continuum is often dominated by nonthermal emission ( the power - law in our fits ) , and the value of @xmath101 is largely unconstrained .",
    "we have taken this situation into account by producing fits at fixed values of @xmath101 : 1 and 10 kev for the si component , 5 and 10 kev for the fe component .",
    "these values represent reasonable maxima and minima for shock - heated plasma in young snrs , and the best - fit value for @xmath101 ( models plotted in figure [ fig-10 ] ) is bounded by them in all cases . the range of ionization timescales listed in table",
    "[ tab-4 ] corresponds to these extrema .",
    "we have also subtracted 0.3 dex from the fitted values to account for the fact that the plane - parallel shock models contemplate a distribution of ionization timescales between 0 and @xmath83 , so the average ( @xmath75 ) is one half of the fitted value .    a rough idea of the level of agreement between our hydrodynamic models and the spectral fits to the observations can be obtained by comparing the fitted values of @xmath102 in the tycho snr from table [ tab-4 ] ( 10.22 - 10.99 for si , 9.72 - 9.78 for fe ) with the values of @xmath103 in the best model for the ejecta emission found by @xcite ( 10.12 for si , 9.69 for fe ) .",
    "these small deviations support the validity of the comparisons made in   [ sub : x - ray - emission : modvsobs ] .",
    "we conclude with an unrelated ( but important ) remark on the fitted ionization timescales listed in table [ tab-4 ] . in all the type ia snrs",
    "we have examined , the @xmath75 of si is significantly higher than that of fe , sometimes by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this constitutes strong evidence that the ejecta of type ia sne must be stratified to some degree ( with most of the fe interior to most of the si ) , favoring delayed detonation models over deflagration models with well - mixed ejecta ( see discussion in   3 of * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we find that optically thick outflows from the white dwarf surface ( sometimes known as ` accretion winds ' ) with velocities above @xmath0 excavate large low - density cavities around the progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> such large cavities are incompatible with the dynamics of the forward shock and the x - ray emission from the shocked ejecta in all the type ia remnants that we have examined . </S>"
