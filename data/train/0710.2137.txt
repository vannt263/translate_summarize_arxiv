    "the heat operator , both on euclidean space and on riemannian manifolds , is a basic tool in finite - dimensional analysis . in infinite - dimensional analysis , the laplacian ( i.e.",
    ", the most naive infinite - dimensional generalization of the finite - dimensional laplacian ) can not be defined as a self - adjoint operator , because there is no such thing as riemannian volume measure in infinite dimensions .",
    "if one replaces the nonexistent volume measure with a gaussian measure or something similar on a nonlinear manifold , the laplacian becomes not only fails to be self - adjoint but fails to be closable in @xmath16 this makes it difficult to define the heat operator as a reasonable operator in @xmath16    in this paper , i will consider only the case of an infinite - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "in that case , i present one possible way of making the heat operator into a well - defined , bounded operator .",

    "let us attempt to construct , then , a standard  ( i.e. , mean zero , variance one ) gaussian measure on @xmath5 this should be given by the nonrigorous expression@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the nonexistent lebesgue measure on @xmath17 and @xmath20 is a normalization constant .",
    "unfortunately , this formal expression does not correspond to any well - defined measure on @xmath5 specifically , ( [ mu.def ] ) _ can _ be used to assign a measure  to cylinder sets , but this set function does not have a countably additive extension to the generated @xmath21-algebra .",

    "if @xmath2 is enough bigger  than @xmath22 in a sense spelled out precisely in @xcite , then there is a measure @xmath23 on @xmath2 that captures the essence of the formal expression in ( [ mu.def ] ) .",
    "one rigorous way to characterize the measure @xmath23 is to use ( [ mu.def ] ) to define a set function on cylinder sets _ in the larger space _ @xmath24 this set function , unlike the one on cylinder sets in @xmath22 has a countably additive extension to the generated @xmath21-algebra .",

    "if we keep our focus on the geometry of @xmath17 ( rather than @xmath2 ) , then we can introduce a laplacian on @xmath2 as follows .",
    "let @xmath37 be an orthonormal basis for @xmath22 with the property that the linear functionals @xmath38 extend continuously from @xmath17 to @xmath24 then let @xmath39 be the coordinate functions ( on @xmath2 ) associated to this basis ; that is , @xmath40 for @xmath41 then we define the laplacian to be the operator given by@xmath42 this operator is defined , for example , on polynomials , that is functions that can be expressed as polynomials in some finite collection of the @xmath43 s .",
    "note that this operator is really the laplacian and _ not _ the frequently considered number operator ( also known as the ornstein  uhlenbeck or dirichlet form operator ) .",
    "that is , ( [ delta.def ] ) is the naive infinite - dimensional generalization of what is usually called the laplacian on @xmath44 ( those who are emotionally attached to the number operator should not lose heart ; that operator will have its role to play later on . )",
    "we would like to try to define the laplacian as an unbounded operator in the hilbert space @xmath45 or more generally @xmath46 in fact , @xmath4 can be defined densely in @xmath47 by , for example , defining it on polynomials . unfortunately , though , the laplacian defined in this way is a nonclosable operator .",
    "( this is equivalent to saying that the adjoint operator is not densely defined .",
    "note that @xmath4 in not self - adjoint in @xmath48 with respect to a gaussian measure , even in finite dimensions . )",
    "nonclosable operators are generally considered to be pathological ; not only does such an operator fail to have a densely defined adjoint , but it is difficult to make any canonical choice of what its domain should be .",
    "the nonclosability of the laplacian can easily be seen by example .",
    "define functions @xmath49 by@xmath50 since , as is easily verified , @xmath51 for @xmath52 we can see that@xmath53 thus , @xmath54 in @xmath7 as @xmath55 tends to infinity . on the other hand",
    ", a simple calculation shows that @xmath56 thus , the pair @xmath57 is in the closure of the graph of @xmath58 which shows that @xmath4 is not closable .",
    "since the laplacian @xmath4 is not closable , we can not expect the heat operator @xmath59 to be any sort of reasonable semigroup in @xmath46 one can define @xmath59 on polynomials as a ( terminating ) power series in @xmath58 but the resulting operator is again not closable .",
    "( this shows , in particular , that the heat operator is not bounded . )",
    "the same example functions @xmath60 demonstrate the nonclosability of the heat operator .",
    "after all , since @xmath61 is constant , @xmath62 is zero and so @xmath63 thus , @xmath64 tends to @xmath65 whereas @xmath60 tends to zero .",
    "the discussion in the previous section shows that we can not regard the heat operator @xmath59 as a reasonable operator from @xmath7 _ to itself_. if , then , we are going to make @xmath59 into a reasonable ( preferably bounded ) operator , then we must regard it as mapping from @xmath7 _ to some other space_. one way to do this is to look at the segal ",
    "bargmann transform .",
    "this transform ( from one point of view ) consists of applying the heat operator @xmath59 to a function and then analytically continuing the resulting function @xmath66 in the space variable . even in the infinite - dimensional case",
    ", this makes sense at least on polynomials .",
    "one can then prove an isometry formula that allows one to extend @xmath59 to a bounded operator from @xmath7 into an appropriate hilbert space of holomorphic functions on the complexification of @xmath24    let @xmath67 denote the space of polynomials inside @xmath46 for all @xmath68 there is a gaussian measure @xmath69 on @xmath70 such that the map@xmath71 as defined on polynomials , is isometric from @xmath72 into @xmath73    this is theorem 4.3 of @xcite . here , again , the analytic continuation is in the space variable ( from @xmath2 to @xmath74 ) with @xmath75 fixed",
    "this theorem shows that @xmath59 extends continuously to an isometric map of @xmath7 into @xmath73 in @xcite , it is shown that the image of this extended map is precisely the @xmath48 closure of the holomorphic polynomials in @xmath73",
    "in the preceding section , we saw that the heat operator @xmath59 , followed by analytic continuation , can be regarded as a bounded ( even isometric ) map of @xmath7 into a hilbert space of holomorphic  functions on @xmath76 provided that @xmath77 ( here holomorphic  means belonging to the @xmath48 closure of holomorphic polynomials . ) we may ask , however , whether it is possible to regard the heat operator itself , without the analytic continuation , as a bounded operator from @xmath7 into some space of functions on @xmath24 the answer , as we shall see in this section , is yes .",
    "the key is to regard the heat operator as mapping from @xmath7 into a space defined using a gaussian measure with a _",
    "different variance_. specifically , we will see that for @xmath12 @xmath59 is a bounded operator from @xmath78 into @xmath79    now , ordinarily , such a changing of the variance  is not a good idea . that is , the identity map , which simply regards a function @xmath80 as an element of @xmath81 is highly ill defined .",
    "after all , it is known that the measures @xmath1 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) are mutually singular ; each measure is supported on a set that has measure zero with respect to the other measure .",
    "thus , two functions that are equal @xmath1-almost every where may not be equal @xmath82-almost everywhere .",
    "thus , the map @xmath84 is not well defined from @xmath7 to @xmath81 because elements of @xmath48 are not functions but rather equivalence classes of almost - everywhere equal functions .",
    "alternatively , one can define the identity map on polynomials ( mapping a polynomial in @xmath7 to the same polynomial in @xmath85 ) and then check that this map is not closable ( consider again the functions @xmath60 ) .",
    "we see , then , that the heat operator is not well defined from @xmath86 to itself and that the identity map is not well defined from @xmath7 to @xmath85 .",
    "nevertheless , when we put these two maps together , two wrongs turn out to make a right : the heat operator is a well - defined and bounded map from @xmath7 to @xmath79 somehow , for @xmath87 if we regard @xmath66 as belonging to @xmath85 rather than @xmath47 things work out better . with this point of view , @xmath59 actually becomes a bounded operator .",
    "actually , more than this can be said . the heat operator is actually bounded ( even contractive ) from @xmath10 to @xmath88 for certain pairs @xmath89 with @xmath90    [ main.thm]fix @xmath91 and numbers @xmath92 such that@xmath93    then the heat operator , initially defined on polynomials , extends to a contractive operator from @xmath10 to @xmath94    note that since @xmath95 is greater than @xmath96 the condition on @xmath13 and @xmath14 allows @xmath14 to be greater than @xmath97 in particular , @xmath98 is always permitted .",
    "theorem [ main.thm ] is the main result of this paper .",
    "i will present two different proofs , in the two following sections .",
    "let @xmath99 be an infinite multi - index , in which all but finitely many of the @xmath100 s are zero .",
    "a * polynomial * is then a finite linear combination of functions of the form @xmath101 we let @xmath67 denote the space of all polynomials . then inside @xmath102 we define a * hermite polynomial * to be a polynomial of the form@xmath103 here , @xmath104 is the _",
    "backward _ heat operator , which is defined on any polynomial by a terminating power series in powers of @xmath105 the formula ( [ h.alpha ] ) is one of many equivalent ways of defining the hermite polynomials . it is known that the hermite polynomials form an orthogonal basis for @xmath47 as @xmath106 varies over all multi - indices of the above sort .",
    "the normalization is as follows:@xmath107 where @xmath108furthermore , for @xmath109 the span of the hermite polynomials is dense in @xmath110    we note that for any @xmath75 and @xmath95 we have@xmath111 by the usual power series argument .",
    "thus for @xmath112 we have@xmath113 this means that the time-@xmath75 heat operator maps the hermite polynomials that go with the hilbert space @xmath7 to the hermite polynomials that go with the hilbert space @xmath79 this simple observation provides the first indication that the right  way to think of @xmath59 is as an operator from a function space defined using @xmath1 to a function space defined using @xmath114    actually , @xmath59 maps an orthogonal basis for @xmath7 to an orthogonal basis for @xmath79 furthermore , since @xmath115 it follows easily that @xmath59 extends to a contractive mapping of @xmath7 to @xmath79    to establish the @xmath116 to @xmath117 properties in theorem [ main.thm ] , we use scaling .",
    "we have said that the identity map ( i.e. , the map @xmath118 ) is not well defined from @xmath7 to @xmath81 or vice versa , because the measures @xmath1 and @xmath82 are mutually singular",
    ". there is , however , a nice map from @xmath85 to @xmath47 or more generally of @xmath119 to @xmath120 consisting of dilation .",
    "that is , if we define @xmath121 by@xmath122 then this map is well defined and isometric from @xmath119 to @xmath123 for all @xmath124",
    ". this amounts to saying that @xmath1 can be obtained from @xmath82 by a dilation of @xmath24    meanwhile , how do hermite polynomials transform under this dilation ?",
    "well , using the formula ( [ h.alpha ] ) for the functions @xmath125 , it is not hard to see that@xmath126 now , it makes sense to start with a hermite polynomial @xmath127 apply the heat operator to get @xmath128 and then apply the dilation @xmath129 to get back to @xmath110 we have , by ( [ h.dilate]),@xmath130    let us introduce the number operator  @xmath131 defined on polynomials by the condition@xmath132 then ( [ ident0 ] ) can be rewritten as@xmath133 where@xmath134 here @xmath135 is defined on polynomials by setting @xmath136 in accordance with ( [ ns.def ] ) .    now , every polynomial is a finite linear combination of hermite polynomials .",
    "what ( [ ident1 ] ) say , then , is that on the dense subspace @xmath67 of @xmath7 we have@xmath137 note that @xmath135 is a bounded operator on @xmath138 , since its action on the orthogonal basis @xmath139 consists of multiplying by @xmath140 thus ( [ ident2 ] ) tells us that @xmath141 has an extension which is a bounded operator from @xmath7 to itself .",
    "we can , however , say more than this .",
    "nelson @xcite has shown that @xmath142 is contractive from @xmath10 to @xmath143 , provided that@xmath144 more precisely , this can be interpreted as saying that for @xmath145 satisfying the above condition , @xmath146 has extension from the space @xmath67 of polynomials to @xmath10 that maps contractively into @xmath147 ( this contractivity property of @xmath135 , where @xmath148 is permitted , is referred to as hypercontractivity . ) the condition ( [ tau.ineq ] ) is , in light of ( [ tau.def ] ) , equivalent to @xmath149 thus , whenever ( [ st.ineq ] ) holds , @xmath141 has an extension that is a contractive map of @xmath10 to @xmath150 since @xmath129 is an isometric isomorphism of @xmath151 onto @xmath152 this amounts to saying that @xmath59 has an extension that is a contractive map of @xmath153 to @xmath94 this establishes theorem [ main.thm ] .",
    "looking back on the argument in the preceding section , we see that the role of the hermite polynomials is not essential .",
    "rather , we used the hermite polynomials to obtain the identity ( [ ident2 ] ) , at which point theorem [ main.thm ] is seen to be a consequence of nelson s hypercontractivity theorem .",
    "that is , our result really hinges on a relationship between the heat semigroup ( the operators @xmath59 ) and the hermite semigroup ( the operators @xmath135 ) .",
    "what ( [ ident2 ] ) is saying is that ( at least on polynomials ) the hermite semigroup at time @xmath145 is the same as the heat semigroup at @xmath65 modulo a dilation , where @xmath75 and @xmath145 are related as in ( [ tau.def ] ) .",
    "what we want to do in this section is explore two other ways ( besides the hermite polynomial argument of the previous section ) of understanding this relationship between the two semigroups .",
    "we begin by looking at the integral kernels for the two semigroups . in the finite - dimensional case ,",
    "the heat semigroup @xmath59 can be computed as integration against the heat kernel , which is a gaussian . meanwhile , in the finite - dimensional case , the hermite semigroup @xmath135 can be computed using the mehler kernel , which is also a gaussian , though of a slightly more complicated variety .",
    "see , for example , the article ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) of sjgren , which derives the formula for the mehler kernel in a way that emphasizes the relationship with the heat kernel . from these formulas for the kernels",
    ", one can easily read off the identity ( [ ident2 ] ) in any finite number of variables .",
    "this is sufficient to establish ( [ ident2 ] ) on polynomials , since each polynomial is a function of only finitely many variables .    as an alternative to using the hermite polynomial argument of the previous section or the argument in this section based on formulas for the integral kernels",
    ", we can explore the relationship between the heat semigroup and the hermite semigroup using commutation relations .",
    "although we have defined the number operator by its action on hermite polynomials ( @xmath154 ) , @xmath131 can also be expressed as a differential operator , as follows .",
    "let@xmath155 then @xmath156 from this it follows , in light of ( [ h.alpha ] ) , that@xmath157    we now use the standard identity @xmath158 where @xmath159.$ ] a simple calculation shows that@xmath160=2\\delta.\\label{relation}%\\ ] ] thus if we set@xmath161 where @xmath162 for @xmath163 @xmath131 defined in this way will have the correct behavior on hermite polynomials .",
    "our task , then , is to compute @xmath164 with the aid of the commutation relation ( [ relation ] ) .",
    "we will apply a special case of the baker  campbell ",
    "hausdorff formula .",
    "suppose that @xmath165 and @xmath2 are linear operators on a finite - dimensional vector space and that @xmath166=\\alpha a.$ ] then we have@xmath167 to prove ( [ bch ] ) , let @xmath168 denote the quantity on the right - hand side .",
    "using the identity @xmath169 it is not hard to show that @xmath20 satisfies the differential equation @xmath170 since the left - hand side of ( [ bch ] ) clearly satisfies the same differential equation and since the two sides are equal when @xmath171 we conclude that the two sides are equal for all @xmath172 ( see , for example , section 4 of @xcite , where a slight variant of ( [ bch ] ) is analyzed in the context of unbounded operators . )",
    "we wish to apply ( [ bch ] ) with @xmath173 and @xmath174 in which case we would have @xmath175 of course , we should not blindly apply results for operators on finite - dimensional spaces to operators on infinite - dimensional spaces . fortunately , however , there is no problem in this instance , since any polynomial @xmath176 is contained in a finite - dimensional space that is invariant under both @xmath177 and @xmath4 and hence under @xmath178 ( a polynomial @xmath13 , by definition , involves only finitely many monomials @xmath179 thus there is some @xmath55 such that @xmath13 is contained in the space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath55 in some finite collection of variables @xmath180 )    on each finite - dimensional invariant subspace , then , we have@xmath181 where we may compute using ( [ tau.def ] ) that@xmath182 thus we get@xmath183    it remains only to understand the factor of @xmath184 on the right - hand side of ( [ bch2 ] ) .",
    "recall that @xmath185 thus , @xmath186 where @xmath187 from this we can see that @xmath188 on polynomials and thus ( [ bch2 ] ) is equivalent ( on polynomials ) to the identity ( [ ident2 ] ) .",
    "the boundedness properties of the heat operator given in theorem [ main.thm ] can be deduced from the relationship ( [ ident2 ] ) between the heat semigroup and the hermite semigroup .",
    "that relationship , in turn , can be understood in various ways , using hermite polynomials , using the integral kernels , or using commutation relations . in the last approach",
    ", the identity ( [ ident2 ] ) follows from the commutation relation ( [ relation ] ) together with the special form ( [ bch ] ) of the baker ",
    "campbell  hausdorff formula .",
    "we have seen in ( [ dilation ] ) that @xmath177 is the generator of dilations .",
    "thus the commutation relation between @xmath177 and @xmath4 in ( [ relation ] ) reflects that the laplacian transforms in a simple way under dilations .",
    "this in turn reflects that the metric on euclidean space transforms in a simple way under dilations .",
    "what prospect , then , is there for proving some analog of theorem [ main.thm ] in some other setting , that is , on some ( possibly infinite - dimensional ) manifold other than euclidean space ?",
    "one possibility is to consider manifolds where there is some natural sort of dilation operators .",
    "for example , on the heisenberg group there is a sub - laplacian that behaves in a nice way with respect to certain nonisotropic dilations .",
    "thus the heisenberg group , whether in its finite- or infinite - dimensional form , is a natural candidate for proving a theorem similar to theorem [ main.thm ] .    on the other hand , even if an infinite - dimensional manifold has no natural dilations , it is still conceivable that something like theorem [ main.thm ] might hold",
    ". specifically , suppose there exists on an infinite - dimensional manifold @xmath189 some natural sort of heat kernel measure @xmath190 based at a fixed point in @xmath191 ( one may think , for example , of path or loop groups and the heat kernel measures considered by malliavin @xcite and driver ",
    "lohrenz @xcite , or various infinite - dimensional limits of finite - dimensional groups and the heat kernel measures of gordina @xcite . )",
    "one might hope that in some cases , the heat operator @xmath59 could be a bounded operator from @xmath192 to @xmath193 for @xmath91 and appropriate pairs @xmath194 one might begin by studying only the hilbert space case and try to see whether @xmath59 is bounded ( or contractive ) from @xmath195 to @xmath196 of course , the methods of proof used in the present paper would not carry over to such a setting . nevertheless , the proposed result is of a simple enough form that some other method of proof may be found .",
    "the conclusion i would like to draw from all of this is that one should not give up on studying the heat operator associated to the true laplacian , even in the infinite - dimensional setting . here by true  laplacian  i mean something like the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator associated to some riemannian metric on an infinite - dimensional manifold , that is the @xmath197 operator associated to the ( fictitious ) riemannian volume measure .",
