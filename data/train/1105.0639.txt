    "in this paper we consider casimir - lifshitz forces @xcite in layered moving media .",
    "our interest to this problem was initiated by a recent discussion on the friction forces that may or may not appear due to quantum - electromagnetic fluctuations in systems involving moving dielectric slabs  @xcite . in this paper , however , we will concentrate on another interesting theoretical issue which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been addressed so far : on the possibility of having _ repulsive _ casimir - lifshitz forces in moving dielectrics .",
    "the so - called casimir repulsion is known to appear between electrically and magnetically polarizable objects in vacuum @xcite , or between dielectric objects of different permittivity that are immersed in a dielectric fluid of an intermediate permittivity @xcite . very recently",
    ", ultralong - range repulsive forces in piston configurations involving cut metallic nanorods have been reported  @xcite .",
    "there have been also attempts on achieving repulsion or `` quantum levitation '' with the use of other metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "however , recently it has been shown that the force between metal - dielectric metamaterial slabs in vacuum is always attractive @xcite .",
    "the symmetry considerations also impose restrictions on the sign of the casimir force @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to consider the case in which the force appears _ only as the result of relative movement _ of dielectric layers .",
    "in contrast to the casimir friction studies , we are interested in the force component perpendicular to the direction of the movement . the main idea of this work is to consider a system which is initially balanced , i.e. , when there is no movement there are no fluctuation - induced forces .",
    "one example of a system with such property is a uniform medium , say a fluid , which is initially at rest .",
    "there is , however , a possibility that when separate layers of a fluid begin to slide one with respect to another the balance is destroyed and there appears a noncompensated attractive or repulsive interaction between the sliding layers .",
    "it should be well understood at this point that the situation that we consider in this paper differs principally from the previously studied case of moving dielectric slabs _ separated by a vacuum _ @xcite . in the latter case , with an appropriate lorentz transformation for the electromagnetic field ,",
    "one may always reduce a problem involving a moving slab of an isotropic dielectric _ in vacuum _ to an equivalent problem with a _",
    "stationary _ slab of the same isotropic dielectric in vacuum .",
    "this is possible because under a lorentz boost the vacuum `` background '' remains itself . quite differently , in this paper we study the casimir - lifshitz interactions that appear in non - uniformly moving _",
    "matter_. applying lorentz transformations in this case results in a more difficult problem involving layers of anisotropic and nonreciprocal media .",
    "therefore , we are going to approach this problem without resorting to an assumption that the available theories @xcite of the casimir - lifshitz forces in dielectrics are also applicable in the case of moving media .",
    "instead , we quantize the electromagnetic field in moving matter and derive a relation for the zero - point energy from the first principles .",
    "this is required because moving media are not invariant under time reversal and the traditional quantization scheme based on a modal expansion in a large box is not applicable ( at least , without significant modifications ) .",
    "in fact , in this work we develop an alternative quantization approach that allows to reuse many of the results of the classic treatment of such nonreciprocal media .",
    "nevertheless , the results of our method fully agree with the phenomenological quantization schemes developed by other authors @xcite .",
    "the nonreciprocity considered in this paper is twofold : it may either be a result of relativistic movements of material fluids or it may manifest itself in uniaxial bianisotropic metamaterials the constitutive relations of which include a term that is responsible for nonreciprocal magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "such metamaterials have been theoretically known for a long time @xcite ; certain practical realizations have been proposed as well @xcite .",
    "some authors do not make a clear distinction between the real moving media and their metamaterial counterparts , taking for granted that the two types can be described with the constitutive relations of the same form .",
    "this is , however , not entirely true .",
    "although applying the lorentz transformations to the maxwell equations written for a moving dielectric results ( in the laboratory frame ) in bianisotropic material relations with nonreciprocal magnetoelectric coupling , such a transformation may not always lead to _ spatially local _ constitutive relations .",
    "indeed , the lorentz transformation intermixes the spatial coordinates with time , therefore , a medium which is nonlocal _ in time _ in one of the reference frames ( i.e. , a dispersive dielectric in its proper frame ) becomes nonlocal _ in both space and time _ in another reference frame .",
    "thus , a moving dispersive dielectric may be described ( in the laboratory frame ) with the equivalent spatially local bianisotropic material relations only in a limited frequency range where the dispersion is negligible .",
    "therefore , in this work the emphasis is mostly on weakly dispersive moving magnetodielectrics for which one may assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are practically constant and real in a wide range of frequencies .",
    "this simplification , however , is not crucial for the main theoretical prediction of this paper , namely , the existence of repulsive casimir - lifshitz forces in layered moving media .",
    "this can be seen from the known fact ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that the range of frequencies that make the dominant contribution to the casimir energy in a pair of material layers separated by the distance @xmath2 is limited by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the phase velocity in the background material .",
    "thus , if @xmath5 is set to the upper boundary of the region of low dispersion of a medium , then the theory developed in this paper will apply at separations @xmath6 . as there",
    "exist real materials with low dispersion and loss up to , at least , the ultraviolet band , the applicability range of our theory may start at hundreds of nanometers .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the theory to the dispersive case is outlined in one of the appendices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ waves ]",
    "we solve classically for the eigenwaves in a moving nondispersive medium and discuss their properties .",
    "in section [ hamiltonian ] we derive an expression for the hamiltonian of the free electromagnetic field in a moving medium and prove an orthogonality relation that holds for the eigenmodes in such a nonreciprocal medium . in section  [ quantization ]",
    "we quantize the ( macroscopic ) electromagnetic fields in a moving medium and express the hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of a bosonic field .",
    "in section  [ lifshitz ] we obtain an expression for the zero - point energy and its regular part that represents the casimir - lifshitz interaction energy . in section  [ layered ]",
    "we solve for the casimir - lifshitz force in layered moving media . in section  [ numerics ]",
    "we present and discuss some numerical results that clearly demonstrate existence of repulsive casimir - lifshitz forces in such media .",
    "we consider a uniaxial medium ( the axis is along @xmath7 ) which is characterized by material relations of the following form [ in this section we work in the frequency domain ; the time dependence is of the form @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the dyadic permittivity and the permeability , respectively , with @xmath12 being the unity dyadic in the plane transversal to @xmath7 , and @xmath13 is the parameter of magnetoelectric coupling . notice that due to the choice of signs in  this coupling in nonreciprocal .",
    "such a medium can be envisioned either as a metamaterial with nonreciprocal bianisotropic inclusions , or as a an effective medium resulting from application of the lorentz transformations to the electromagnetic fields in a magnetodielectric moving with certain velocity @xmath14 along the @xmath15-axis . in the latter case ,",
    "the material parameters as seen in the stationary frame satisfy ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the permittivity and the permeability in the comoving frame , @xmath19 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the material parameters are assumed nondispersive and lossless in  , but , in fact , these relations may be also generalized for dispersive moving media if plane waves are considered ( this is further discussed in appendix  [ appc ] ) .    it should be noted that when these transformations are applied to a medium with @xmath22 , they result in @xmath23 and the old values of the permittivity and permeability , independently of the velocity @xmath14 .",
    "thus , due to   , a vacuum appears as a `` medium '' with properties invariant with respect to relative motion , while media with nontrivial refractive index are seen differently in different inertial frames of reference .",
    "the maxwell equations for the fields in a moving medium can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "are quadratic with respect to the frequency and can be easily solved . as follows from  and  the equations are the same for both tm@xmath30 and te@xmath30 modes .",
    "the roots of the dispersion equations are given by @xmath38 } \\over n^2-\\beta^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression under the square root is nonnegative because @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the case",
    "when @xmath41 ( i.e. , when the velocity is below the threshold of the cherenkov effect ) only a single solution of the dispersion equation is nonnegative , namely , the one with the plus sign in  .    when @xmath42 there may exist zero , one , or two nonnegative roots of the dispersion equation , depending on the wave vector . without any loss of generality we may assume @xmath43 and , thus , @xmath44 .",
    "then , the roots of the dispersion equation are both negative ( positive ) if @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 . when @xmath48 , there are two roots of opposite signs .",
    "the boundary between these regions defines the cherenkov cone as seen from the stationary frame . in the comoving frame ( i.e.",
    ", in the frame in which the medium is at rest ) , the same cone is seen as having the half - angle @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , which is a well - known result .",
    "the nonreciprocity of the material relations ",
    "results in an obvious property of eqs .  ",
    ": these equations are not invariant with respect to the change of sign of  @xmath51 .",
    "however , the time - harmonic fields that are the solutions of  must satisfy the reality condition @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents either @xmath54 or @xmath55 and the symbol  @xmath56 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "thus , their spatial fourier transforms , @xmath57 , that represent the complex amplitudes of the respective plane waves , are such that @xmath58 .",
    "it is immediately seen that the equations   are invariant under such a transformation that changes the signs of @xmath51 and @xmath37 simultaneously .",
    "in addition to this , the dispersion equations are also invariant with respect to a simultaneous change of signs of @xmath51 and @xmath59 , as follows from  .    the instantaneous fields in a given polarization , @xmath60 , can be written as a superposition of the plane wave solutions of or : instf _ f(_x , t ) = _ p _ f__p(_k)e^i(_k_x - _p t ) , where the index @xmath61 labels the roots @xmath62 [ eq .  ] for a given @xmath37 , and @xmath63 represent the complex amplitudes of the waves that belong to the two different branches of  .",

    "any branch may be chosen ; for the following we select the branch with the plus sign in front of the square root in .",
    "classically , the hamiltonian of the free electromagnetic field in a moving medium can be obtained by considering the maxwell equations written for instantaneous fields : @xmath67 where @xmath68 . performing the standard steps on derivation of the poynting theorem",

    "indeed , if a function  @xmath173 is analytic and has roots in a closed region @xmath174 with the boundary  @xmath175 , then the sum over its roots in this region can be found as @xmath176 .",
    "there is , however , a subtle difficulty when applying this principle to the function of the characteristic equation , because @xmath177 may have poles and branch points",

    "the main difficulty is with the branch points , as the poles of the reflection coefficients do not depend on @xmath2 and only add a constant to the sum representing the zero - point energy , i.e. , they only shift the origin of the zero point energy which is irrelevant .",
    "however , it is possible to rewrite the characteristic equation in a form that does not have branch points and is meromorphic in the complex plane of @xmath51 ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) .",

    "one may recognize in the so - called generalized lifshitz formula for the casimir energy at zero temperature .",
    "as we are not using a covariant formulation of electrodynamics in this paper , the relativistic covariance of the obtained result   requires an additional discussion .",
    "some implications of special relativity on the reflection matrices @xmath192 are outlined in appendix  [ appa ] . in particular",
    ", it can be verified that if there exists a reference frame in which the moving media are at rest , then   reduces to the classic dzyaloshinski - lifshitz result @xcite for the casimir energy of stationary magnetodielectric slabs .",
    "this is , of course , just a consequence of the material relation transformations  .    above the threshold of the cherenkov radiation ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath193 , the dispersion relation   may result in negative frequencies irrespectively of which branch of is selected . by virtue of this",
    "leads to the appearance of negative quanta in the range of wave vectors that belong to the cherenkov cone .",
    "these quanta are responsible for a potential instability in a medium that moves with a velocity higher than the phase velocity in the same medium at rest .",
    "indeed , any stationary ( in the laboratory frame ) object that perturbs the electromagnetic field will radiate in such quickly moving medium . because of this unavoidable instability , in the following sections we restrict our analysis only by the case when @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we will consider the casimir energy and force that result from the zero - point fluctuations in a layered moving medium , namely , in a configuration analogous to the canonical problem solved by lifshitz  @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider a structure composed of a moving layer of finite thickness @xmath2 sandwiched in between two other semiinfinite moving layers ( fig .  [ fig_layers ] ) .",
    "the velocities are assumed uniform within the layers and collinear with the @xmath15-axis which is parallel to the layer interfaces . such a structure",
    "may be understood as a simplified model of a nonuniformly moving fluid , in which the width of the transition regions where the velocity changes continuously is assumed small compared to the thickness of the layers . in other words , we neglect all friction effects that may exist at the boundaries of the moving layers . in practice such situation",
    "may be achievable , for example , in certain phases of liquid helium at very low temperatures or within metamaterial layers where the velocity is merely a structural parameter ( i.e. , when there is no real movement ) .",
    "it is evident that one may always choose a reference frame in which the middle layer is at rest .",
    "however , we prefer not to impose such a restriction , ensuring in this way a straightforward generalization of our results to the case of multiple moving layers . as follows from the treatment of section  [ lifshitz ] , in order to obtain the casimir energy of this system , one must first solve for the reflection matrix at an interface of two moving layers .",
    "although there are some results available in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , they are typically given in a form unsuitable for our purposes ( e.g. , one of the layers is assumed to be vacuum ) therefore , in appendix  [ appa ] we derive the necessary expressions for the components of the reflection matrices @xmath194 that are defined in terms of the @xmath15-components of the electric and magnetic fields . with these expressions at hand , the casimir interaction energy in the canonical triple - layer structure is given by where the matrices @xmath192 correspond to the two interfaces of the middle layer . from the expressions derived in appendix  [ appa ] , it is also seen that the reflection matrices are invariant under a simultaneous change of signs of @xmath51 and @xmath59 : we used this property when obtaining the expression for the zero point energy  .",
    "next , the casimir force component normal to the interfaces is found by differentiating   with respect to the thickness of the middle layer  @xmath2 ( we use the convention that a positive force corresponds to attraction ) : @xmath195 where @xmath196 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath197 .",
    "it can be shown that the same expression for the casimir force must also hold in the case of dispersive material parameters which is discussed in appendix  [ appc ] .    because the dispersion equation for the waves in ( lossless and nondispersive ) moving media is not symmetric with respect to the change of sign of the frequency @xmath51 , it is not anymore a function of @xmath198 as in ( lossless and nondispersive ) reciprocal media . due to this asymmetry",
    "the reflection matrices @xmath192 are in general _ complex _ at the imaginary frequencies @xmath199 while the respective matrices in reciprocal media are always real under the same circumstances .",
    "therefore , in general , the eigenvalues @xmath196 of the matrix @xmath197 are also complex . in section  [ numerics ]",
    "we will , however , show that the expression for the casimir force always results in real numbers , due to the symmetry of the integrand of  .",
    "to simplify the integral further we introduce new dimensionless variables @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , in which becomes @xmath204 one may notice that both @xmath205 and @xmath206 do not depend on @xmath207 ( they depend only on the relative wavenumbers @xmath208 and @xmath209 because the material parameters are assumed nondispersive ) , therefore , by substituting @xmath210 we obtain @xmath211 where the integral over @xmath212 results in the polylogarithm @xmath213 .",
    "thus , the casimir force in layers of moving ( nondispersive ) media has the same dependence on the distance as the casimir force between two ideally conducting plates in vacuum .",
    "it is also seen that the value and the sign of the force are determined by the the eigenvalues @xmath196 of the matrix @xmath197 , which in turn depend on the relative velocities of the layers . in the next section",
    "we will study numerically this dependence and will demonstrate that the casimir forces in moving media may be repulsive under certain conditions .",
    "in this section the expression for the casimir force is analyzed numerically .",
    "it is convenient to start from discussing some properties of the reflection coefficients .",
    "first of all , we would like to remind that the elements of the reflection matrix are defined in terms of just a single component of the electric and magnetic field vectors ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "therefore , in general , their values differ significantly from the classic reflection coefficients into co- and cross - polarized tm and te waves ( the cases when reduces to the classic formulas are mentioned in appendix  [ appa ] ) . for example , the magnitudes of the cross - components @xmath214 and @xmath215 in our definition may exceed unity when the characteristic impedance of the layers is different from the free - space impedance @xmath216 .    at real frequencies the elements of the reflection matrix",

    "it is also noticeable that the reflection is rather low overall because the parameters of the layers are chosen so that there would be no reflection if there were no movement .",
    "however , the grazing waves reflect strongly , as well as the waves with @xmath224 .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that the waves with @xmath59 greater than the mentioned limit are evanescent in the moving layer , as can be easily seen from the dispersion equation .",
    "the behavior at the imaginary frequencies is better understood from the eigenvalues @xmath196 of the matrix @xmath197 written for the complete structure composed of the three moving layers . accordingly to  , these eigenvalues determine the magnitude and the sign of the casimir force .",

    "the middle layer is stationary in both cases .    in the case when the two outer layers move in the same direction with the same velocity ( fig .",
    "[ figlambdarep ] ) the two eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath197 coincide .",
    "the eigenvalues are complex in this case , with the real part concentrated mostly in the negative half space , and the imaginary part changing sign when @xmath59 changes sign , which is a consequence of the fact that @xmath225 when @xmath190 , @xmath161 and @xmath59 are real .",
    "when substituted into the integral the dominating negative real parts of the eigenvalues result in a negative casimir force , which corresponds to a _ repulsion . _ the contribution of the imaginary part vanishes due the symmetry of the integrand . to further illustrate this , in fig .",
    "[ figintrep ] we plot the integrand of   as a function of the normalized wavenumbers @xmath209 and @xmath226 .",

    "[ figlambdaatt ] ) the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath197 are both real and positive ( in a less symmetric scenario when the absolute velocities of the two layers differ there also appears a non - zero imaginary part ) .",

    "some of the main ideas of the approach that we are going to use in this appendix have been borrowed from ref .",
    "@xcite .    instead of considering an initially open structure , we start with the situation in which the moving layers are bounded by pec walls , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ appfig1](a ) .",

    "the latter makes @xmath263 a meromorphic function of  @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we may apply the principle of argument ( as explained in section  [ lifshitz ] ) to this function instead of applying it directly to @xmath264 .",
    "the integral over the respective path ( see fig .  [ appfig1](b ) ) in the complex plane of @xmath51 reads in this case @xmath266 + \\\\",
    "+ { 1\\over 4\\pi i}\\int\\limits_{c_{ab}}\\o\\,d\\log { e^{4\\gamma(l - b_1-b_2)}\\over\\det\\left\\{\\=r_1\\.\\=r_2\\right\\}},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath267 is an open path that is obtained from @xmath182 by introducing a cut at the point where the semicircle crosses the real axis .",
    "such a cut is necessary because the expressions under the integrals on the right hand side of are not meromorphic in @xmath51 .",
    "physically , the integral represents a part of the zero point energy that is due to the modal frequencies which are the roots of that have been encircled by the path @xmath182 . because we are interested only in the variation of the zero point energy with the separation @xmath2 between the two moving slabs",
    ", we may drop the last addend on the right hand side of   as it is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the second addend can be made arbitrary small when @xmath268 due to the nonvanishing positive real part of @xmath247 .",
    "thus , the distant - dependent part of the integral is given by @xmath269 where the first integral on the right hand side is taken over a path that lies on the imaginary axis and the second integral is over the two halves of the semicircle .",
    "the integral depends on the thicknesses of the slabs  @xmath241 and the slab separation  @xmath2 .",
    "now we let @xmath270 in   ( when taking this limit , we assume that still @xmath271 ) . in this limit , due to the nonvanishing imaginary part of @xmath51 under the integrals on the right hand side of , the reflection coefficients of the pec - backed layers @xmath192 will tend to the respective reflection coefficients of open half spaces ( which are derived in appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "the last step of the derivation is to let the radius of the semicircle tend to infinity : @xmath272 . in this limit , which corresponds to infinitely high frequencies , all dispersive materials ( including the materials with very weak dispersion that we consider in this paper ) become transparent",
    "therefore , @xmath273 under the integral over the semicircle , and this integral vanishes .",
    "this leads to the expression   for the interaction part of the zero - point energy .",
    "let us consider an interface in a pair of layers . without any loss of generality we let the interface be at @xmath237 with the @xmath274-axis orthogonal to the interface . at the interface the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields of the two main polarizations are given by eqs .",
    ": @xmath275    @xmath276    where we have replaced @xmath277 in the denominator with an equivalent expression that follows from eqs .",
    ". these relations hold at both sides of the interface , with the material parameters @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and @xmath13 , and the wave vector components taken at the respective sides .    in the following we are going to formulate and solve a plane wave reflection problem at an interface of two moving media . to simplify writing",
    "we introduce the following notations @xmath280 where @xmath281 .",
    "then , with these notations at hand we consider a tm@xmath30 wave of unit amplitude incident from the region @xmath282 and write the fields in this region ( the factor @xmath283 common at both sides of the interface is dropped ) as @xmath284 and in the region @xmath285 as @xmath286 where @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath182 , and @xmath289 are yet unknown wave amplitudes of the two reflected and the two transmitted waves , respectively , and @xmath290 . as one can see , we take into account the fact that a tm@xmath30 incident wave may produce in general both polarizations in the reflected and transmitted fields .    equating the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields at both sides of the interface at @xmath291 one obtains a system of four equations for the four unknown wave amplitudes . solving this system for @xmath287 and @xmath288 ( i.e. , for the reflected waves ) we find @xmath292    the case of a te@xmath30 incident wave can be considered in a completely analogous manner .",
    "below we give just the final result for the amplitudes of the reflected waves : @xmath293    thus , we may introduce the following reflection matrix written in terms of the @xmath15-components of the fields : reflmatr    (    c e_z^ref + _ 0 h_z^ref    )    =    (    cc a & _ 0 ^ -1b + _ 0 b & a    )    .",
    "(    c e_z^inc + _ 0 h_z^inc    )    (    cc r^ee & r^eh + r^he & r^hh    )    .",
    "(    c e_z^inc + _ 0 h_z^inc    )    .",
    "as can be verified , the elements of the reflection matrix reduce to the standard fresnel reflection coefficients of the p- and s - polarized waves in the special case of @xmath294 , @xmath295 , for which @xmath296 , @xmath297 and @xmath298 , and also in the case of @xmath23 , @xmath299 , for which @xmath300 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 . in the general case",
    ", the standard reflection matrix defined in terms of the tangential components of the electric field can be obtained from the matrix with the following similarity transformation : @xmath303    as mentioned in section  [ layered ] , the reflection coefficients are in general complex , even at purely imaginary frequencies .",
    "the complexity of the reflection matrix at imaginary frequencies is an unusual property that by itself deserves a separate study . here",
    "we will only briefly outline the main reason behind this complexity .",
    "indeed , from a physical point of view , the reflection at imaginary frequencies @xmath199 can be understood as the response to an incident wave that has the time dependence of the form @xmath304 , i.e. , to a signal that grows exponentially with time .",
    "let us now consider an interface between a vacuum at @xmath305 and a moving medium at @xmath285 , and let us assume that there is a plane wave with such time dependence impinging on the interface from the side of the the vacuum .",
    "we set up the same coordinate system as above so that the movement is along the @xmath15-axis . in this coordinate system the incident wave of , for instance , the tm@xmath30 polarization can be written as illustr e_z^inc = e_0 e^i(k_y y + k_z z)e^t - x , where @xmath161 and @xmath59 are the _ real _ propagation factors in the interface plane , and @xmath306 is the solution of the vacuum dispersion equation at imaginary frequencies .",
    "as we are interested only in an illustration , we let @xmath295 in  , so that the tm@xmath30 wave becomes the standard tm wave with respect to the plane of incidence .",
    "a vacuum is invariant under the lorentz transformations ( see section  [ waves ] ) , as are the components of the electromagnetic fields parallel to the velocity vector ( the @xmath15-components ) , therefore to solve for the reflection coefficient we may switch to the comoving frame in which the reflection coefficient is simply illustr2",
    "r^ee = _ 0- _ 0 + , where illustr3=+ i k_z v , k_z=k_z - i v / c^2 are the imaginary frequency and the @xmath15-component of the wave vector transformed to the comoving frame . substituting   into   we obtain after some manipulation illustr4 r^ee = -_r + _ r , where @xmath307 and @xmath308 .",
    "as is readily seen , @xmath309 is in general complex when @xmath310 and @xmath311 , and this complexity is due to the fact that the relative movement of the layers intermixes the imaginary frequencies with the real - valued wavenumbers by the virtue of the lorentz transformations .",
    "it is easy to check that the result is a particular case of more general formulas .",
    "conversely , one may verify that if there exists a reference frame at which the moving matter is at rest , then under a transformation of the form   the complex propagation factor @xmath312 and the reflection matrix   reduce to the respective expressions in stationary magnetodielectrics .",
    "additionally , when such a transformation is applied to the integrand of  , one may notice that the integration element @xmath313 is preserved , because the jacobian of the transformation   equals unity : @xmath314 .",
    "therefore , the casimir force per unity of area ( the casimir pressure ) given by   is the same in all reference frames that move parallel to the layers , provided that the velocities of the layers are transformed accordingly to the relativistic velocity addition law .",
    "such an invariance of the casimir pressure   is not surprising , as physically the pressure exerted on the moving layers is related with the component of the photon momenta that is perpendicular to the direction of the movement , and this component is preserved under the lorentz transformation .",
    "thus , we may conclude that our formulation extends the known theory of casimir - lifshitz forces in dielectric layers in a way fully consistent with special relativity .",
    "in this appendix we discuss how the results obtained for non - dispersive moving media may be generalized to include the effects of frequency dispersion in the effective material parameters .",
    "let us consider an isotropic dispersive magnetodielectric described by the following material relations in its proper frame : mr1_d(_x,t ) = _ 0_0^d , mr2 _",
    "b(_x,t ) = _ 0_0^d , where @xmath315 and @xmath316 are the dielectric and magnetic response functions .    in the proper frame which is co - moving with the medium , the field components orthogonal to @xmath317 can be expressed through the same components in the stationary laboratory frame as applor1_e _",
    "t = _ l(_e_t + _",
    "v_b_t ) , _ h_t = _ l(_h_t - _ v_d_t ) , applor2_d_t = _ l(_d_t + 1c^2_v_h_t ) , _",
    "b_t = _ l(_b_t - 1c^2_v_e_t ) , where @xmath317 is the medium velocity ( along @xmath318 ) and @xmath319 . substituting  into ",
    "one obtains _",
    "d_t + 1c^2 _ v_h_t = _ 0_0^d , _ b_t - 1c^2 _ v_e_t = _ 0_0^d , where @xmath320 , @xmath321 . from here , int1 _ d_t + 1c^2 _ v_h_t = _ 0_0^d , int2 _ b_t - 1c^2 _ v_e_t = _ 0_0^d.    in order to obtain the constitutive relations in the laboratory frame , one has to solve the system of integral equations  to express @xmath34 and @xmath35 in terms of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is evident that , in general , the above system may not result in a simple proportionality relation between the flux and field vectors .",
    "however , for plane waves this system is easily solvable and results in relations  of section  ii with @xmath322 , @xmath323 , and @xmath324 , where @xmath325 is the angular frequency in the proper frame of the moving medium . as this frequency depends on the wavenumber in the laboratory frame , the relations  with the modified parameters readily describe a spatially nonlocal medium , as was mentioned in introduction .",
    "one may also verify that such modification does not affect the frequency domain treatment of section ii . the equations ",
    "written for the plane waves in a moving nondispersive magnetodielectric hold also in the case of dispersive moving media if the parameters @xmath326 , @xmath327 , and @xmath328 are understood as @xmath329-dependent .",
    ".   becomes a transcendental equation in the dispersive case .",
    "the important symmetry of eqs .   with respect to the simultaneous change of signs of @xmath51 and @xmath37 discussed in section ii is preserved in the dispersive case , because @xmath330 and @xmath331 , @xmath332 .",
    "thus , the generalization of the classical part of this study to the dispersive case is trivial .",
    "the quantum - theoretical part of this paper is based on the expressions   and for the hamiltonian of the free electromagnetic field . as has been mentioned in section  [ hamiltonian ] ,",
    "these expressions are physically understood as summations over the energies of all possible modes in a modal expansion of the electromagnetic field .",
    "therefore , it is only natural that the same expressions must also hold in the case of frequency dispersive material parameters , provided that the basic relations for the energy @xmath90 and the momentum @xmath91 of a photon in a dispersive medium remain the same as in a vacuum : @xmath333 , @xmath334 , @xmath335 .",
    "hence , one must also expect the diagonalized form of the hamiltonian   to be valid in the dispersive case , in which the modal frequencies @xmath120 are found from the transcendental equation   that must take into account the material dispersion ."
