    "the isoperimetric inequality for shapes in @xmath0 states that the area enclosed by a simple closed curve is at most that of a circle of the same length , and that equality occurs only for circles .",
    "this immediately implies that among all simple closed curves enclosing a given area , a circle is the shortest .",
    "several variations on the isoperimetric inequality were considered in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss inequalities involving the notion of `` _ _ free perimeter _ _ '' for a shape @xmath1 , located inside a simple , bounded , planar domain @xmath2 .",
    "we may assume that there is a border or wall surrounding this domain , or alternatively that this domain is an island surrounded by water .",
    "a simple shape @xmath1 inside this domain will be defined by a boundary curve , some portion of which may touch and even follow the border ( wall / shoreline ) of the domain / island .",
    "the free perimeter of the shape will be defined as the length of the boundary curve of @xmath1 that does not overlap with , or trace , the border of the enclosing domain @xmath2 .",
    "the problem that we can pose with these definitions is the following : given the domain @xmath2 , determine the shape with the shortest free - perimeter that has a given area @xmath3 .",
    "this problem is , of course , that of determining the way to cut out a shape of a total area @xmath3 from @xmath2 with the least effort of cutting , i.e. with the _",
    "shortest cut_. equivalently , this is the problem of determining the shortest length `` fence '' that can separate a contiguous region of area @xmath3 inside the domain @xmath2 .",
    "this interpretation clearly explains the totally misleading title of our paper , in which we do not take any short - cuts and of course we do not discuss fencing as a sport that happens to be played on a rectangular , strip - shaped , `` ring '' .",
    "a related problem is that of finding the connected shape of largest area that can be `` lifted out '' of @xmath2 with a total length of `` cuts '' or `` fences '' less than or equal to @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we solve the problem raised above when the region @xmath2 is a rectangle .",
    "we prove that the shortest cut , i.e. the minimum free perimeter , that separates a shape with half of the area of @xmath2 has , as expected , the length of the shorter side of the rectangle .",
    "we then provide the shortest free perimeter for all @xmath5 ratios from 0 to 1 .",
    "we note that the problem we discuss is closely related to the problem a26 , `` _ _ dividing up a piece of land by a short fence _ _ '' , discussed in the book `` _ _ unsolved problems in geometry _ _ '' @xcite .",
    "the challenge posed there is that of dividing a convex shape into two equal - area parts .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite and to some recent follow - up papers @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 $ ] be a bounding rectangle of dimensions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the area we want to enclose with a region of shape @xmath1 , and denote by @xmath10 the length of the free perimeter of the shape @xmath1 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath11 the length of the free perimeter of a shape @xmath1 with area @xmath3 , such that @xmath1 has the smallest value of @xmath10 out of all the shapes of area @xmath3 .",

    "for this , we shall first prove the following result  :    [ thm1 ] @xmath14    to prove the above stated , and rather natural and hardly surprising result , we shall need to combine several simple facts .",

    "we may have @xmath1 that touches 0,1,2,3 or 4 sides .",
    "let us consider these cases separately  :    * case 0 :* @xmath1 touches 0 sides of @xmath6 $ ] . in this case , the classical isoperimetric inequality of fact [ lemma1 ] yields  : @xmath30    * case 1 :* @xmath1 touches 1 of the sides of @xmath6 $ ] . in this case ,",

    "we have shown that in all cases , @xmath50 .",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath1 is defined as the half - rectangle @xmath51 , the free perimeter obtained is exactly @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we have shown that @xmath52 .     that touches all four sides of the rectangle @xmath6 $ ] and its complement @xmath53 that comprised out of a set of connected regions @xmath41 .",
    "]    in fact , we have shown something stronger that just @xmath54 . in all cases where @xmath1 touches 0 , 1 , 2 or 4 sides of the rectangle , its free perimeter @xmath10 was strictly higher than @xmath7 , by factors of @xmath55 .",
    "interestingly , note that @xmath56 is maximized where @xmath57  :    let us define  : @xmath58    in order for @xmath59 we must have @xmath60 .",
    "namely  : @xmath61    in other words  : @xmath62 and subsequently  : @xmath63    assigning @xmath64 back to @xmath65 yields  : @xmath66",
    "from the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] we saw that cutting the rectangle @xmath6 $ ] into two equal pieces by a cut parallel to the short side of length @xmath7 of @xmath6 $ ] is optimal w.r.t the length of the free perimeter .",
    "the results we have , in fact , state that if a shape @xmath1 of an area @xmath3 is to be separated by a short fence in @xmath6 $ ] we shall have  : @xmath68    we shall now ask what happens when @xmath67 , and as @xmath69 . it is clear that for any @xmath3 we can separate a shape of area @xmath3 with a cut of size @xmath7 , hence for every value of @xmath70 it holds that @xmath71 .    contemplating the above inequalities we realize that while @xmath3 is such that @xmath72 is not less than @xmath7 we can not hope to find a better cut !",
    "hence , if  : @xmath73 namely , if  : @xmath74 we shall have  : @xmath75    this can also be obtained using a quarter of a circle of radius @xmath76 .",
    "what happens when @xmath77 ?",
    "it can be seen that from this point it pays to use quarter - circular of smaller and smaller radii , that will achieve the bound of @xmath78 .",
    "we therefore get the following result  :    [ thm2 ] @xmath79",
    "due to symmetry considerations , we can see that for any shape @xmath1 of area larger than @xmath81 we can simply analyze the combined free perimeters of the shapes that comprise the complement @xmath35 \\setminus s = s^{c}_{1 } , s^{c}_{2 } , s^{c}_{3 } , \\ldots , s^{c}_{k}$ ] , as it clearly equals the free perimeter of @xmath1 . from the results shown in the previous section , we already know that the free perimeter of @xmath1 is minimized when @xmath53 is in fact a single connected shape , that touches either two adjacent sides of the rectangle , or three of its sides ( depending on the area of @xmath1 ) . in other words , @xmath53 is either a portion of the rectangle that is generated using a cut which is parallel to its shorter side , or a quarter of a circle of radius @xmath82 .",
