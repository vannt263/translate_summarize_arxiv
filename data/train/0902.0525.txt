    "spontaneous breaking of lepton number leads to a massless goldstone boson , the majoron ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "there are two well - known experimental probes for the majoron : the first is the invisible width of the @xmath4 boson , very precisely measured at lep @xcite .",
    "the second is neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite .",
    "the nemo-3 collaboration , for example , has published limits on half - lives for majoron - emitting neutrinoless double beta decay for a number of isotopes @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are different astrophysical constraints on the majoron from the cooling of red giant stars and supernovae @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility to search for majorons , namely charged lepton decays with majoron emission , has attracted considerably less attention .",
    "indeed , the limits on @xmath5 quoted by the particle data group @xcite are all based on experimental data which is now more than 20 years old .",
    "probably this apparent lack of interest from the experimental side is due to the fact that both , the triplet @xcite and the doublet majoron @xcite , are ruled out by lep data , while the ( classical ) singlet majoron model @xcite predicts majoron - neutrino and majoron - charged - lepton couplings which are unmeasurably small .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a theoretically well motivated extension of the standard model . with the first data taking of the lhc only months away , searches for susy will gain momentum soon .",
    "one of the many virtues of susy is the fact that the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) provides an interesting candidate for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) , usually assumed to be the lightest neutralino ( @xmath6 ) _ if r - parity is conserved . _ a stable , electrically neutral lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) will escape the detector and lead to the famous missing momentum signal , upon which standard susy searches are based .",
    "if r - parity is broken , the lsp decays and the cdm candidate is lost . for explicit r - parity violation ( ) , the missing energy signal is degraded , but a larger number of jets and charged lepton final states should make discovery of a ( comparatively ) easy task . in _ spontaneous _ ( s- ) , however , the lightest neutralino can decay invisibly through @xmath7 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , if the scale of is low , this decay mode can be easily dominant and s - can be confused with a standard mssm with @xmath8 conserved .    here",
    ", we revisit @xmath5 within spontaneous r - parity violation .",
    "our calculation is based on the model of @xcite . in this model",
    "the majoron is mainly singlet , thus escaping the lep bounds .",
    "this is different from the original spontaneous model @xcite , which used the left - sneutrinos to break r - parity .",
    "nevertheless , in our model the majoron can play an important role phenomenologically . in @xcite @xmath5",
    "was calculated for a tau neutrino mass of @xmath9 mev . here",
    "we show that ( a ) despite the fact that current neutrino mass bounds are of the order of ev or less , theoretically @xmath10 can be ( nearly ) arbitrarily large in s- , and ( b ) @xmath10 is large in the same part of susy parameter space where the invisible neutralino decay is large , making the discovery of r - parity violation at the lhc difficult .",
    "br(@xmath10 ) thus gives complementary information to accelerator experiments .    at the same time , the meg experiment @xcite has started taking data .",
    "meg is optimised to search for br(@xmath11 ) with a sensitivity of br(@xmath11 ) @xmath12 ( few ) @xmath13 .",
    "while the impressive statistics of the experiment should allow , in principle , to improve the existing bound on br(@xmath10 ) @xcite by a considerable margin , the experimental triggers and cuts make it necessary to resort to a search for the radiative majoron emission mode , br(@xmath14 ) , if one wants to limit ( or measure ) the majoron - charged - lepton coupling .",
    "we therefore also calculate br(@xmath14 ) .    in the next section",
    ", we will briefly discuss s - and give an approximative , analytical estimation of br(@xmath5 ) and br(@xmath15 ) .",
    "we then present our numerical results in section ( [ sec : num ] ) , showing the correlation of br(@xmath5 ) with the invisible branching ratio of the lightest neutralino decay . in section ( [ sec : exp ] ) we then turn to a brief discussion of existing experimental bounds and comment on how a limit on br(@xmath14 ) might be used to put a bound on the majoron - charged - lepton coupling .",
    "we then close with a brief conclusion in section ( [ sec : cncl ] ) .",
    "the model we consider @xcite extends the particle spectrum of the mssm by three additional singlet superfields , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with lepton number assignments of @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the superpotential can be written as @xmath20 strictly speaking only @xmath16 is necessary to spontaneously break @xmath8 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath17 and @xmath18 allows to construct a superpotential which purely consists of trilinear terms , thus potentially solving also the @xmath21 problem of the mssm . at low energy various fields",
    "acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "besides the usual mssm higgs boson vevs @xmath22 and @xmath23 , these are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "note , that @xmath28 generates effective bilinear terms @xmath29 and that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 violate lepton number as well as r - parity .",
    "the observed smallness of neutrino masses guarantees that the operators generated by these vevs are small .",
    "the smallness of @xmath33 implies that either @xmath34 or @xmath30 is small , but not necessarily both .    details of the model , such as mass matrices and couplings , can be found in @xcite , for the phenomenology of the lsp decay in this model see @xcite . for brevity in the following",
    "we will concentrate on only a few , relevant aspects of the phenomenology of this model : the neutrino mass matrix , the lightest neutralino decay to majorons and charged lepton decays .",
    "the main motivation to study r - parity breaking supersymmetry certainly is that generates neutrino masses and thus contains a possible explanation for the observed neutrino oscillation data . for the spontaneous model defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsuppot ] ) , the effective neutrino mass matrix at tree - level can be cast into a very simple form @xmath35 here , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are defined as @xmath41 @xmath42 is the determinant of the ( @xmath43 ) matrix of the heavy neutral states ( the four mssm states , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , plus the three fermionic components of the new singlet superfields of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsuppot ] ) ) @xmath47\\ ] ] and @xmath48 .",
    "the `` photino '' mass parameter is defined as @xmath49 . since @xmath37 @xmath50 in the limit of large @xmath51 .",
    "one can easily fit the observed neutrino masses and angles using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff ] ) , see @xcite and the short discussion in the next section .    from a phenomenological point of view",
    "the most important difference between spontaneous and explicit r - parity violating models is the appearance of the majoron .",
    "the pseudo - scalar sector of the model we consider has eight different eigenstates .",
    "two of them are goldstone bosons .",
    "the standard one is eaten by the @xmath4 boson , the remaining state is identified with the majoron . in the limit @xmath52 the majoron profile is given by the simple expression @xmath53 here , @xmath54 and terms of order @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , have been neglected .",
    "majorons are weakly coupled , thus potentially lead to a decay mode for the lightest neutralino which is invisible .",
    "neutralino - majoron couplings can be calculated from the general coupling @xmath57 @xmath58 mixing between the neutralinos and the neutrinos then leads to a coupling @xmath59 . in the limit",
    "@xmath60 one can derive a very simple approximation formula for @xmath61 .",
    "it s given by @xcite @xmath62 where the dots stand for higher order terms neglected here and @xmath63 is the matrix which diagonalizes the ( mssm ) neutralino mass matrix . @xmath64 and @xmath65 . here",
    "@xmath66 is the matrix which diagonalizes either the part of the ( @xmath67 ) effective neutrino mass matrix , proportional to @xmath38 or @xmath40 , depending on which gives the larger eigenvalue .",
    "( [ eq : majcl ] ) shows that for constant @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 as @xmath30 goes to infinity .",
    "this is as expected , since for @xmath71 the spontaneous model approaches the explicit bilinear model .",
    "we note that , in addition to the majoron there is also a rather light singlet scalar , called the `` scalar partner '' of the majoron in @xcite , @xmath72 .",
    "the lightest neutralino has a coupling @xmath73 , which is of the same order as @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath72 decays to nearly 100 @xmath74 to two majorons , this decay mode contributes sizeably to the invisble width of the lightest neutralino , for more details see @xcite .",

    "<S> in models where the breaking of lepton number is spontaneous a massless goldstone boson , the majoron ( @xmath0 ) , appears . we calculate the theoretically allowed range for the branching ratios of majoron emitting charged lepton decays , such as br(@xmath1 ) and br(@xmath2 ) , in a supersymmetric model with spontaneous breaking of r - parity . </S>",
    "<S> br(@xmath3 ) is maximal in the same region of parameter space for which the lightest neutralino decays mainly invisibly . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of br(@xmath3 ) thus potentially provides information on r - parity violation complementary to accelerator searches . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss existing bounds and prospects for future improvements on the majoron coupling to charged leptons . </S>"
