    "hundreds of brown dwarfs ( bds ) have been discovered in the last few years , both within star - forming regions @xcite and among field stars @xcite . still",
    "very little is known about their formation processes .",
    "first indications that bds may form as ordinary stars , i.e. via accretion from a circumstellar disk , come from observations of h@xmath0 @xcite and near - infrared excess emission @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of bds only excess emission at longer wavelengths provides the indisputable evidence for the presence of circumstellar material @xcite . thermal emission of warm dust around bds has been observed by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "very recently , our search for submm / mm emission from young bds provided the first detection of cold dust around two of them @xcite .",
    "for the first time , this allowed to estimate the mass of the circumstellar material and to relate it to the mass and luminosity of the central object .",
    "these results open up new interesting questions : _ is the circumstellar material around bds confined in a disk ?",
    "are these disks similar to t  tauri disks or different ones ? what is the effect of the ultra - low luminosity on the disk properties ? _ tentative modeling of disks has been performed by @xcite based on two isocam mid - infrared ( mir ) measurements with the general assumption of flared disk geometry .",
    "the first ground - based observations of one of their objects showed that the flared disk model can not be applied blindly : at least in one case a flat configuration can better explain the observations @xcite .",
    "the same flat geometry has been later used by @xcite to interpret the isocam measurements of other bds .",
    "a thorough investigation of the disk properties requires measurements of different disk zones , i.e. in different wavelength domains . in this letter",
    "we compile the first complete spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a disk around a bd .",
    "the goal of this paper is to test the basic models and determine which model parameters can be constrained from the combination of short- and long - wavelengths observations .",
    "our study focuses on the object cfht - bd - tau  4 ( 2massi j0439474 + 260140 ) which was found and confirmed as a young bd by @xcite .",
    "its very strong h@xmath0 emission @xcite coupled with x - ray activity @xcite and further spectral signatures @xcite prove that this bd is intensively accreting matter .    in the following ,",
    "we first present the sed of cfht - bd - tau  4 , we prove that the circumstellar material can not be in a spherical shell and we argue towards a disk configuration .",
    "we model the sed applying different disk geometries .",
    "finally , we discuss similarities and differences with accretion disks around t  tauri stars .",
    "in this section we compile the observations available on cfht - bd - tau  4 .",
    "optical and near - infrared data , together with an estimate of the line - of - sight extinction ( a@xmath1=3  mag ) , have been published by @xcite .",
    "an additional l - band flux is given in @xcite .",
    "we retrieved archival isocam images at 6.7 and 14.3   and we measured fluxes of 28.4 and 38.5  mjy by using an aperture of 24 .",
    "we accept a photometric accuracy of 20% as given in the isocam calibration accuracies document .",
    "our group observed cfht - bd - tau  4 in the mm and submm continuum at the iram-30 m and the jcmt telescopes .",
    "the data reduction and analysis is presented in @xcite .",
    "we provide the summary of the above fluxes and errors in table  [ flux ] .",
    "the main input parameters for the modeling are derived directly from the observations .",
    "cfht - bd - tau  4 is expected to be a member of the taurus star - forming region located at a distance of 140 pc .",
    "we assume an effective temperature of @xmath2  k for an m7@xmath30.5 spectral type @xcite and a mass of 70  m@xmath4 . in agreement with @xcite , we calculate a total luminosity of 0.1 l@xmath5 which is brighter than the luminosity of the youngest ( 1 myr ) isochrone from @xcite .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the dust opacity ( @xmath6 ) and the mass of the circumstellar dust can be calculated from the expected optically thin submm and mm fluxes . in the optically thin regime",
    "the flux depends on the wavelengths as f@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wavelength dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "a value of @xmath9  2 has been measured for interstellar dust particles @xcite , while @xmath9  1 is generally used for circumstellar disks where grain growth is expected to take place @xcite . in our case",
    "the slope of the sed is @xmath10 , with the error computed from the uncertainty in the flux measurements .",
    "this implies that @xmath8 is @xmath11 . due to the large error on the measured @xmath8",
    ", we can not fix the dust opacity . to compare our results with disks around t  tauri stars",
    ", we assume the same dust opacity as suggested by @xcite which amounts to 2  @xmath12/g at 1.3  mm . for a dust temperature between 10 and 20  k and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100",
    ", we calculate a total circumstellar mass of 1.50.3  m@xmath4 .",
    "we note that adopting the 10 times lower opacity of interstellar grains would lead to 10 times larger circumstellar masses .",
    "a simple spherical shell model is first investigated by using the radiative transfer ( rt ) code of @xcite .",
    "the mass of the circumstellar material is set to 4  m@xmath4 in order to reproduce the submm and mm fluxes .",
    "different power - law density distributions , inner / outer radii and dust properties were tested ( see table  [ models ] ) .",
    "the 1d simulations always predict a visual extinction at least an order of magnitude higher than measured by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , the simple shell configuration has to be excluded and a 2d distribution has to be considered .    the most plausible 2d circumstellar dust distribution is believed to be in the form of a disk @xcite . in the following , we test various versions of the most widely accepted disk configurations , i.e. the flat @xcite and the flared disk @xcite .",
    "the opening angle of the flat disk is constant , while that of the flared disk increases with radius .",
    "an optically thin superheated layer is expected for flared configurations .",
    "an addition to some of the flared disks is the self - consistent treatment of the inner rim that , due to its higher temperature , puffs - up with respect to the flaring disk behind it @xcite .",
    "similar changes in the flared disk geometry have been proposed by @xcite as an effect of stellar accretion and viscous dissipation .",
    "for all the models , we adopt a dust opacity which follows the silicate mass absorption coefficient by @xcite for short wavelengths and the opacity law by @xcite for long wavelengths .",
    "the transition wavelength depends on the grain size : for small grains of 0.1   radius the two opacity laws meet at 100  , while for 10   grain they meet at 200  .",
    "we consider two flat disk models ( m4 and m5 in table  [ models ] ) : one with a single disk temperature distribution @xcite and one with an additional hot surface layer .",
    "the main difference between the two approximations is at 10  , where the two - layer model predicts an emission feature , which is absent in the optically thick one - layer flat disk . for both configurations , plausible physical parameters",
    "provide a good fit . because of the lack of measurements at the silicate feature",
    ", we can not discriminate between the two cases .",
    "for the flared disk configurations @xcite , a too high mir flux is predicted by the models when the disk inner radius is determined by the dust sublimation temperature . to reduce the mir emission three possibilities",
    "are considered : high disk inclination , a large inner gap and the shadow of a puffed - up inner rim .",
    "considering the low line - of - sight extinction measured towards cfht - bd - tau  4 , almost edge - on disks ( inclinations larger than 60 ) are not plausible . even when a large inner gap of about 0.07  au is introduced in the classical flared disk model ( m7 ) , the mir measurements at 6.7 and 14.3   can not be simultaneously fitted . on the contrary",
    ", the flared disk with a puffed - up inner rim and large inner gap reproduces well the sed of cfht - bd - tau  4 ( m9 in table  [ models ] and solid line in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) .    to demonstrate the effect of grain growth , we also tested an opacity law for silicate grains with 10   radius @xcite .",
    "such grains lack the emission feature at @xmath13  .",
    "the one - layer flat disk model is not affected by the different dust opacities .",
    "for the two - layer flat configuration , the silicate feature at 10   vanishes , but the sed can still be well fitted with parameters similar to those provided in table  [ models ] . because larger grains have lower opacities in the mir regime , the flared disk model with the puffed - up rim can fit the observations with a slightly smaller inner gap ( 0.04  au ) .",
    "even with the addition of larger grains , the classical flared disk model does not explain the observed sed .",
    "the combination of short and long wavelengths observations allow us , for the first time , to investigate the properties of the circumstellar dust around a bd .",
    "the sed shows an overall shape similar to that of t  tauri stars . adopting the opacity by @xcite",
    ", we calculate a circumstellar mass of 0.31.5  m@xmath4 , which is a few percent of the bd s mass . a similar mass ratio is found for t  tauri stars and their disks .",
    "thus , the disk is unlikely to be truncated by any previous ejection event @xcite .",
    "a discussion is presented in @xcite .    since spherically distributed dust would result in too high extinction , we argue towards the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "our disk models suggest that _ either the disk is flat , or it is flared with a puffed - up inner rim and a large inner gap_. a flat geometry was previously suggested by @xcite to explain the sed of a disk around a bd candidate .",
    "the present results support a flat disk as well , thus suggesting that this might be general for disks around very low - luminosity objects .",
    "a flat dust distribution could be a hint towards large grain sizes since large grains are expected to settle in the disk midplane ( see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion of the physical conditions under which flared disks can exist ) .",
    "future observations at 10   could further strengthen this picture if no silicate feature is found .",
    "should the disk be flared with a puffed - up inner rim , an inner gap 5 times larger than the dust sublimation radius is required to account for the observed sed .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields is not sufficient to explain inner gaps as large as those found in the modeling ( about 9  r@xmath5 ) , see for example @xcite .",
    "the material close to the bd could be cleared out by a massive planet , as suggested in the case of tw hya by @xcite",
    ". however , the most realistic explanation is the presence of a close companion with a spectral type similar to the primary .",
    "this would also explain the over - luminosity of this bd @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the estimated separation of the possible companion would be @xmath14  mas , unresolvable with any current imaging technique .    to fully characterize bd disks ,",
    "a detailed exploration of their sed is essential . especially important",
    "are the silicate emission features and the wavelength range between 60 - 180",
    ". the upcoming sirtf and sofia missions will be capable of gathering a statistically relevant number of complete seds , as well as providing a reliable disk frequency .",
    "we present the first comprehensive models of the circumstellar dust surrounding a young bd .",
    "our results are :    * the overall shape of the sed is very similar to those of t  tauri disks * a spherical dust distribution contradicts the observed extinction * a simple flat disk fits well the observations * the flat geometry hints towards large grains * the classical flared disk does not reproduce the sed of cfht - bd - tau  4 * a flared disk with a puffed - up inner rim can only explain the observed sed if it has an inner gap much larger than the dust sublimation radius    c c c c 0.658 & 0.062 & 0.002 & 1 + 0.822 & 1.23 & 0.03 & 1 + 1.25 & 22.9 & 1.0 & 1 + 1.65 & 38.7 & 1.0 & 1 + 2.17 & 46.5 & 1.4 & 1 + 3.75 & 52.5 & 1.5 & 2 + 6.7 & 28.4 & 5.7 & 3 + 14.3 & 38.5 & 7.7 & 3 + 850 & 10.8 & 3.7 & 4 + 1300 & 2.14 & 0.7 & 4 +      m1 & rt & shell & 0 & & no & 4&a@xmath1560  mag & ( 1 ) + m2 & rt & shell & @xmath161 & & no & 4&a@xmath15300  mag & ( 1 ) + m3 & rt & shell & @xmath162 & & no & 4&a@xmath151000  mag & ( 1 ) + m4 & aa & flat & one - layer & 0.02 & yes & 1.4 & @xmath17=2045(35 ) & ( 2 ) + m5 & aa & flat & two - layer & 0.01 & yes & 4 & @xmath17=530(10 ) & + m6 & scc & flared&no rim & 0.03 & ( yes ) & 0.7 & @xmath17=80 - 82 & ( 3 ) + m7 & scc & flared&no rim & 0.07 & no & 0.7 & & ( 3 ) + m8 & scc & flared & rim & 0.03 & no & 0.3 & & ( 3 ) + m9 & scc & flared & rim & 0.05 & yes & 0.3&@xmath17=820(12 ) & ( 3 ) +      adams , f. c. , lada , c. j. , shu , f. h. 1987 , , 312 , 788 allard , f. , hauschildt , p. h. , alexander , d. r. , tamanai , a. , & ferguson , j. w. 1999 , , volume 212 , 127 apai , d. , pascucci , i. , henning , th . , sterzik , m. f. , klein , r. , semenov , d. , gnther , e. , & stecklum , b. 2002 , 573 , l115 beckwith , s. v. w. , sargent , a. i. , chini , r. s. , & gsten , r. 1990 , , 99 , 924 beckwith , s. v. w. , henning , t. , & nakagawa , y. 2000 , protostars and planets iv , p. 533",
