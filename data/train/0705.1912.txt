    "in general , it is difficult to prove for a simplicial complex @xmath0 that it does _ not _ have a simplicial embedding ( or not even a simplicial immersion ) into @xmath2 .",

    "bokowski & guedes de oliveira @xcite have employed oriented matroid enumeration methods to show that one specific instance , number  54 from altshuler s list , does not have a simplicial embedding ; the other 58 cases were shown not to have simplicial embeddings only recently by l.  schewe @xcite .    for _ piecewise linear _ non - embeddability proofs",

    "thus , infeasibility of a certain integer program might prove that a complex @xmath8 has no geometric realization .    in the following , we present novik s approach ( cf .",
    "parts [ mt : sym ] and [ mt : coboundary ] of theorem [ thm : system ] ) in a reorganized way , so that we can work out more details , which allow us to sharpen some inequalities defining the polytope in @xmath7 ( cf .",

    "further we interpret this polytope as a projection of a polytope in @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the simplicial complex consisting of all faces of the @xmath11-simplex .",
