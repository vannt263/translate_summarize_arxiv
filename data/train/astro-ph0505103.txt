    "seyfert galaxies are generally classified into two groups , based on their spectra and emission line widths in the optical .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies are characterized by broad permitted lines with typical fwhm velocities @xmath51000  km s@xmath4 , and narrower forbidden lines with fwhm @xmath6500  km s@xmath4 , with a non - stellar underlying continua .",
    "the spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies show only the narrow emission lines , and their non - stellar contribution is normally detected only in polarized light .",
    "the generally accepted unification scheme states that the two classes of galaxies are not disparate , but that seyfert 2 galaxies are seyfert 1s with nuclei that are obscured by a dusty molecular torus .",
    "@xcite discovered broad balmer and fe@xmath7ii lines in the seyfert 2 galaxy  ngc  1068 . from polarization arguments they concluded that the lines must be emanating from regions synonymous with the broad - line region ( blr ) of seyfert 1s .",
    "subsequent studies reinforced the notion that seyfert 2 blr are obscured from the line of sight but can be observed via scattered radiation @xcite .",
    "therefore it is now generally accepted that the seyfert designation 1 or 2 is contingent upon the orientation angle as perceived by the observer . + a more dynamical analysis is needed to determine if these two types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are indeed similar and powered by the same processes .",

    ", such studies can be easily accomplished efficiently .",
    "high spatial and spectral resolution data in particular can provide us with detailed diagnostics of the nlr and its vicinity .",
    "we have therefore undertaken an investigation of the kinematics across the nlr of ngc  4151 , one of the nearest seyfert galaxies .",
    "+ this type of observation and kinematic modelling was previously done on ngc  1068 , a bright seyfert  2 galaxy @xcite .",
    "the data were taken with the low resolution ( @xmath8  = 1000 ) g430l grating of stis , and the radial velocity measurements were made using [ o  @xmath0iii ]  @xmath9  5007 emission along two slit positions 0@xmath0.1 wide .",
    "they found that a simple biconical outflow model closely matched the observed radial velocities such that emission - line knots accelerate out from the nucleus to @xmath2 1000  km s@xmath4  then decelerate back to the systemic velocity .",

    "+ in this paper , we present the same modeling procedures as in the two previous studies , but at a spectral resolving power of 9000 , and five parallel slit positions covering the nlr of ngc  4151 .",
    "this provides the most detailed map of the kinematics in a seyfert 1 nlr , similar to that obtained for the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  1068  @xcite .",
    "we used a systemic velocity of 997  km s@xmath4 , based on h i observations of the outer regions of the host galaxy @xcite and a hubble constant of 75  km s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 , which gives us a distance of 13.3mpc to ngc  4151 , with 0@xmath0.1 corresponding to a projected linear scale of 6.4pc on the sky .",

    "noisy spectra roughly @xmath5 6  from either side of the nucleus were not fit .",
    "close to the nucleus , and on either side , emission knots showed two and sometimes three major kinematic components ( figure  [ gaussfits ] ) , and in such cases we fitted each identifiable peak with gaussians .",

    "the appearance of the same components in multiple rows along the slit indicates that we are obtaining multiple measurements of spatially - resolved knots , the brightest of which can be seen in figure  [ intensity ] . for comparison purposes , we separated these components by relative intensities and plotted them in different colors ( later in the paper ) .",
    "+ the central peaks of the gaussians give us the central wavelengths from which we used the doppler formula to find radial velocities for each component .",
    "there are three sources of uncertainty in the velocity measurements .",
    "the first results from the fact that the [ o  @xmath0iii]emission lines are not gaussians as shown in figure  [ gaussfits ] . by actually measuring the centroid of a line for a number a spectra",
    ", we found that our gaussian fitting routine introduced a maximum fitting error of 0.75    in the centroid .",
    "the second error comes from emission cloud displacements from the center of the 0@xmath0.2 slit in the dispersion direction .",
    "we calculated that a 0@xmath0.1 offset would contribute an error of 0.56   .",
    "noisy spectra introduced the third error .",
    "various noisy spectra was measured several times and the wavelength shifts were found to fluctuate by 0.30   maximum .",
    "the errors were converted to velocities and added in quadrature to produce a total maximum error of @xmath13 60  km s@xmath4 .",
    "we also varied the continuum placement for randomly selected spectra but found that this did not shift the central wavelength significantly .",
    "+ the s / n ratio of the integrated [ o  @xmath0iii ]  flux was large near the nucleus , approaching values of 1000 , and then decreased rapidly to @xmath14100 at about 1from the nucleus . the s / n ratio reduced to @xmath14 50 at 3 , @xmath1430 at 4 , and @xmath1510 at 6 .",
    "we did not attempt to measure the emission if the s / n ratio was @xmath163 , which typically occured at distances of @xmath176 .",

    "+ in paper 1 , mostly bright clouds with one or two kinematic components were detected and fitted to a model . in this paper , our data show multiple components ( 1 , 2 , and 3 ) and hence in order to make a comparison to paper 1 , we separated these kinematic components according to total flux in the line .",
    "we assigned the color red to components with the strongest flux ; blue , to components with the the next strongest flux , and black , to components with the weakest flux .",
    "this kind of separation of the components by fluxes incorporates a minor problem .",
    "consider figure  [ cartoon - spectra ] showing a progression of spectra from ( a)(f ) .",
    "the components are ordered 1 , 2 , and 3 going from left to right , and the colors that we assign are marked below each component .",
    "notice that in ( b ) , the second component is labeled black ( since it has less flux under the line ) and the third component is labeled blue . for similar reasons , the black and blue colors switched places again in ( c ) , as a new second component emerged .",

    "the relative nature of our separation criteria is made clear in ( e)(f ) ; with only two components detected , they are labeled red and blue , and when we have detected only one component , we labeled those red . in our velocity plots ,",
    "this results in occasional mixing between the low and medium flux clouds , but does not significantly affect our model , since it was based on a general fit for all points .",
    "the plot of fluxes ( bottom plot ) in figures [ slit1-vel - fwhm - flux ] and [ slit-2to5-vel - fwhm - flux ] clearly show the effects of misidentification are small ; as one can see the colors are clearly separated .",

    "note that the points tend to clump together , which reflects the ability of stis to resolve the clouds . in the upper plots",
    ", the brightest emission line clouds at each position in the northeast are red shifted , while those in the southwest are blue shifted relative to the host galaxy .",
    "the highest velocities occur closer to the nucleus and velocities as high as 800  km s@xmath4  can be seen in approach and recession .",
    "the general trend is an increase in radial velocity from near zero at the nucleus to a maximum redshift or blueshift within @xmath141  of the nucleus . between @xmath142  to @xmath144  the velocities reduce from about 200  km",
    "s@xmath4  to 100  km s@xmath4  and at distances of about 4  or more from the nucleus , the radial velocities taper off to the enlr rotational velocities .",
    "the medium flux clouds generally show the same pattern as the bright ones except in slits 1 and 4 where they are not confined to only blue shifts in the sw .",
    "also in slit 2 , the medium flux clouds show blueshifts in the ne .",
    "the low flux clouds also follow similar patterns as the bright clouds except in slits 1 and 4 where one can see additional flow patterns opposite to that of the bright clouds .",
    "the fwhm in the middle plots show a range of widths at each position , but a decreasing average width with distance from the nucleus at all flux levels . in the bottom plot ,",
    "all three components show a strong decrease in flux with distance and significant structure that corresponds to the emission line knots .",
    "+ @xcite found a number of low - flux , high velocity clouds in ngc  4151  using a combination of wfpc2 and stis images and stis slitless spectra .",
    "some of these faint clouds did not fit into the general picture of biconical outflow ( e.g. redshifts were detected in the sw where blueshifts dominate ) . to check for consistency , we identified hutchings et al.s clouds in our data and compared our velocities with theirs .",
    "our measurements are closely correlated over a wide range of velocites as shown in figure  [ hutchings - das - velocity ] .",
    "also shown on top of the figure are the letters of various high velocity knots , labeled according to hutchings scheme .",

    "these can be seen in the velocity plots of figures [ slit1-vel - fwhm - flux ] and [ slit-2to5-vel - fwhm - flux ] .",
    "in @xcite , the radial outflow from the seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc  1068  was accounted for by a simple biconical radial velocity law , @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the distance from the central source and @xmath20 being a constant .",
    "they used stis low - resolution long - slit spectra taken in the [ o  @xmath0iii ]  emission regime .",

    "the best - fit model used an inclination of 5@xmath1  ( relative to the plane of the sky ) for the bicone axis . in paper  1 , the same modeling procedures were used to map the kinematics of ngc  4151 .",
    "the bicones were assumed to have identical geometrical and physical properties and a filling factor of 1 within the cones and no absorption of the [ o  @xmath0iii ]  photons .",
    "interestingly , the velocity laws @xmath18 and @xmath22 further out also worked in this model . the middle column of table [ compare - ngc4151 ] shows the parameters for the best fit model from paper  1 .",
    "+ in this paper we test the model in paper  1 using higher resolution data and more coverage of the nlr of ngc  4151 .",
    "the kinematic modelling code used in paper  1 was updated to test different velocity laws , corresponding to radial outflow .",
    "parameters for the bicone that were allowed to vary in our code include the extent of each cone along its axis ( @xmath23 ) , the minimum and maximum half opening angles ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , the inclination of its axis out of the plane of the sky ( @xmath26 ) , the velocity turnover radius ( @xmath27 ) ( measured radially outward from the nucleus ) , and the maximum velocity at the turnover point ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "a constant velocity law and velocity proportional to higher powers of radius did not work well .",
    "motion perpendicular to the bicone axis and infall do not work ( see paper  1 ) .",
    "+ our code generates a two - dimensional velocity map and samples this map with slit positions , orientations , and widths that match those of the observations .",
    "figure  [ models ] shows our model velocity field projected onto the sky .",
    "the purple color is the highest negative velocity and the red is the highest positive velocity , with intermediate velocities given in gradients .",
    "next to the fields are velocity extractions from slit 1 done to visually aid the reader .",
    "the extraction consists of four parts , two from the back side of the bicone , and two from the front side .",
    "the upper two graphs consists of velocities extracted from the top and bottom parts respectively , of the back side of the bicone .",
    "similarly the lower two graphs represent the front side of the bicone . in each graph , the relevant extracted section is in shaded grey , in addition to the total extraction from slit 1 , which put things into perspective .",
    "radial velocities were extracted along the five slits and plotted as a function of position in arc seconds .",
    "note that the model was tilted out of the plane of the sky so that the extracted radial velocities would best match the general trend of the data .",
    "the other bicone parameters were then adjusted until the best match between model and data was established . in this fit , emphasis was placed on the high and medium flux points .",
    "the low flux points in slits one and four indicate a flow pattern which in some cases is opposite to that determined from the model ; for the rest of the slits however , there is general agreement .",
    "+ figure  [ plotshade ] shows all five slits with the models in shaded grey and the observed data points in colors .",
    "zero position corresponds to the nucleus .",
    "these radial velocity plots show that the northeast side is mostly redshifted , and the southwest side is mostly blueshifted , except for some low luminosity clouds ( black points ) , and a few medium luminosity clouds ( blue points ) , which exhibit an unusual flow pattern .",
    "these are shown by the arrows in figure  [ plotshade ] and to some extent , between 0  and -2 in figure  [ plotshade ] ( e ) .",

    "a closer inspection of plots ( a ) and ( f ) shows minuscule differences in the fit , with ( a ) being slightly better .",

    "the fitting parameters from paper  1 are also presented .",
    "following the deceleration trend of the knots in all five slits , the model suggests that the knots return to systemic velocity at a larger distance from the nucleus than previously found in paper  1 .",
    "this extends the bicone longer than in paper  1 , to 400pc as opposed to 288pc .",
    "the turnover point is much closer in , 96pc compared to 162pc and our inner opening angle is 15@xmath1 , which makes our model less evacuated along the bicone axis .",
    "the high luminosity knots seem to travel outward from the nucleus at lower inclination and was modeled in paper  1 as such ; however , in this paper we also incorporate medium and low luminosity knots into the plots and hence our match suggests a larger inclination of 45@xmath1 .",
    "the other parameters , inner and outer opening angles , and maximun velocity of the gas , show only minor differences between the two papers .",
    "the maximum velocity before turnover was increased in our paper to account for the fast moving medium and low luminosity clouds seen in figure  [ plotshade ] .",
    "these clouds are accelerated to high speeds close to the nucleus and they therefore play a major role in modelling the turnover point , which we found to be @xmath36 96 pc . if we had used only the bright clouds ( red points ) then our turnover point would have been larger and similar to that of paper  1 .",
    "+ figure  [ fwhm - vel ] shows a plot of fwhm versus radial velocity for all five slits combined .",
    "there seems to be no definite correlation between the fwhm and the absolute value of the radial velocity .",
    "this indicates that the directions of velocity dispersion are not preferentially along the direction of the velocity vector .",
    "the fwhm is therefore not due to a purely radial gradient .",
    "however , various low luminosity clouds do show some trend .",
    "figure  [ vel - fwhm - low - flux ] shows evidence of a correlation for a combined plot of isolated groups of points shown by the arrows in figure  [ plotshade ] .",
    "these groups of points do not follow the general trend of the bright clouds and they consist of only medium and low flux points .",
    "this leads us to believe that these particular knots are either preferentially disturbed in the direction of the velocity vector , or that they exhibit turbulence in proportion to their velocity .",
    "note that the faintest clouds have higher fwhm and radial velocity .",
    "we will look at these rogue clouds more carefully later in the paper . + figure  [ bicone ] shows a model of ngc  4151  with the bicone as it should appear in the sky to us , using our final model parameters .",

    "the @xmath37 angle , which is the angle between the bicone axis and the normal to the galactic disk , is 36@xmath1 . due to the bicone",
    "s large opening angle , it will intersect a sufficiently thick galactic disk ( e.g. , a scale height of @xmath36 100 pc ) . the ne bicone will also intersect the ne galactic disk due to symmetry .",
    "this intersection produces the observed geometry of the enlr as shown by @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the [ o  @xmath0iii ]  clouds in some seyfert galaxies have been interpreted as outflow away from ( perpendicular to ) the jet axis .",
    "several authors have suggested close relationships between the radio jets and the optical emission such that hot gas around the radio lobes expands and propels the nlr clouds to high velocities ( see gallimore et al .",
    "1996 ; capetti et al .",
    "1997b : axon et al .",
    "although this scenario seemed plausible when applied to ngc  1068 , it failed to explain the turnover velocity where emission knots started to decelerate back to systemic velocity , at about 2from the nucleus @xcite .",

    "the axis outflow was discussed in @xcite in relation to ngc  4151 .",
    "they found that regardless of inclination , the radial velocities should appear both red - shifted and blue - shifted with equal magnitudes at each position along the axis .",

    "we extracted radio emission along the same slit positions as our 5 slit positions in figure  [ intensity ] .",
    "the radio fluxes were summed across each 0@xmath0.2 slit width and normalized to the peak of the brightest radio knot , which was in slit 1 .",

    "figure  [ radio - slit - all ] shows intensity plots of the radio emission together with the our radial velocities . here",
    "we expect that bright radio knots would produce roughly symmetric red and blue shifts at the positions of the knots if the axis outflow applies to ngc  4151 .",
    "however we see no evidence for such a scenario in any slit .",

    "we see some red - shifted material in the upper bicone at 0@xmath0.5 , but this is too far away to be affected by the radio knot . near the brightest radio flux in ( c ) and ( d ) , we see some blue and red shifted [ o  @xmath0iii ]  clouds respectively , but again there are no symmetric counterparts for these clouds .",
    "similar plots of the velocity widths show no evidence for larger fwhm at the positions of the radio lobes .",
    "we conclude that the radio lobes have no discernible effects on the kinematics of the nlr clouds .",
    "we confirm our previous biconical outflow models @xcite , that were used to match the radial velocities of the nlr in ngc  4151 , using higher velocity - resolution stis spectra . in @xcite ,",
    "the model was based on two slit positions at different position angles . here",
    "we use five parallel slits , all at the same position angle , but different from that used in @xcite .",
    "however , the previous model was found to be consistent with ours , except for a few adjustments .",
    "the turnover point of the velocity ( where clouds start to decelerate ) occurs much closer to the nucleus than the previous model showed , and the point where the clouds velocity approaches systemic velocity is further away .",

    "this means that we are still looking outside the bicone , contrary to the seyfert 1 classification , and general seyfert unification models .",
    "the most likely explanation for an unobscured view of the nucleus is that the bicone edges , and therefore the torus edges , are not sharp .",
    "+ the radio jet lobes do not seem to cause any disturbance to the [ o  @xmath0iii ]  emission and are not directly responsible for the acceleration of the gas , as is evident from figure  [ radio - slit - all ] .",

    "the same plots with fwhm also show no correlation between position of the radio lobes and kinematics of the [ o  @xmath0iii ]  knots .",
    "+ we propose possible scenarios to explain the faint clouds that do not fit the biconical outflow pattern , such as in figure  [ plotshade ] ( a ) .",
    "one explanation is that of backflow due to shocks , as a result of outflowing bright clouds impacting on an ambient medium .",
    "the low luminosity clouds could be flowing back along the bicone with a velocity that is proportional to the outflow velocity ; that is , the higher the outflow velocity , the higher the backflow velocity .",
    "the top arrow in figure  [ plotshade ] ( a ) points to rogue points which may have resulted from fast outflowing gas in the near side of the southwest bicone , with the low emission gas moving in the opposite direction of general outflow , leaving a trail of clouds in the direction of the nucleus ; see location b in figure  [ backflow - cartoon ] . because the near side of the cone has a higher projected velocity , we see the rogue clouds trailing back along this side .",
    "the bright clouds are accelerated in the first few tenths of an arcsec and the rogue points mimic the same behaviour , but in the opposite direction .",
    "the same argument holds for clouds pointed at by the second arrow in figure  [ plotshade ] ( a ) .",
    "this backflow most likely comes from the far side of the cone ( d in figure  [ backflow - cartoon ] ) , since the velocities and position there agree with those of the rogue clouds .",
    "the knots pointed at by the arrow in figure  [ plotshade ] ( b ) can be associated with backflows from the near side of the ne bicone where their positions coincide with those of the bright clouds at location a in figure  [ backflow - cartoon ] .",
    "clouds pointed at by the lower arrow in figure  [ plotshade ] ( d ) can also be explained by backflow from the near side of the ne bicone .",
    "the velocities and positions of the rogue clouds are similar to those of the clouds in this region .",
    "the argument loses some credibility , however , when we consider the upper arrow in figure  [ plotshade ] ( d ) .",
    "these high velocity rogue knots seemed to be geometrically associated with the near side region of the sw bicone , ( b in figure  [ backflow - cartoon ] ) , but there are no bright clouds in this region to contribute to the backflow behaviour . + there is another possibility which can explain the unusual flow pattern of all the rogue clouds .",
    "the argument is that the rogue clouds are moving in an entirely different geometry flowing away from the nucleus as shown in figure  [ backflow - cartoon ] , locations e , f , g , and h. note that backflows from a , b , c , and d , are equivalent to projected velocities from g , f , e , and h , respectively .",
    "this geometrical equivalent of the backflows is but one of the ways in which the projected velocities agree , since the geometry could be positioned anywhere along the line of sight to yield the same projected velocities .",
    "we adopt the geometry whereby clouds emanate from the central nucleus , as this scenario seems to be the most plausible one .",
    "if that is the case then the flows from locations e and f would be at a rather large angle ( near 90 degrees ) with respect to the bicone axis .",
    "this would suggest that clouds are flowing close to the plane of the torus , which might explain their low flux .",
    "the problem with this scenario is that there is no means for the clouds to be ionized unless radiation is coming from holes in the torus .",
    "it is also not clear how these clouds would be accelerated without radiation or winds from the nucleus , as these clouds do indeed attain high velocities .",
    "+ we prefer the first scenario , because the rogue clouds appear at the positions of the turnover velocities of the bright clouds .",
    "this supports the idea ( paper 1 ) that the bright clouds may be plunging into an ambient medium at the turnover point which cause the clouds to slow down and eventually return to zero velocity , at the same time producing the faint clouds in backflow",
    ". the second scenario seems less likely , because there is no other evidence at present for a leaky torus .",
    "we thank c. mundel for providing the radio map of ngc  4151  used in this study .",
