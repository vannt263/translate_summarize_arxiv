    "the last ten years have witnessed an enormous progress in our knowledge of the optical properties of supernovae ( sne ) of all types . however , comparatively little is still known about these objects in infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "light - curves in the @xmath3 bands have been obtained only for a handful events since the pioneering work of elias et al .",
    "( 1981 , 1985 ) on type ia sne .",
    "aside from sn  1987a ( e.g. suntzeff & bouchet 1990 ) , sn  1990e ( schmidt et al .",
    "1993 ) , and sn  1980k ( dwek et al .",
    "1983 ) , virtually nothing is known of the @xmath3 light curves of type ii sne .",
    "the spectroscopic studies have been mostly limited to optical wavelengths ( 3000 - 10000  ) also , and few spectra have been obtained beyond this range @xcite .    given the rapid technological development of ir light detection over recent years , the next logical step is to expand the sn observations to the broadest possible spectral range . with this idea in mind , in 1999 we started a program to obtain optical and ir photometry and spectroscopy of nearby sne ( @xmath4@xmath50.08 ) , in order to better understanding 1 ) the nature of sne , 2 ) the explosion mechanisms , 3 ) the relation of sn properties to their stellar environments , and 4 ) the use of sne as distance indicators .",
    "the `` supernova optical and infrared survey '' ( soirs ) uses telescopes at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , the carnegie institution of washington at las campanas observatory ( lco ) , the european southern observatory ( eso ) at la silla and cerro paranal , the steward observatory ( so ) of the university of arizona , and the cerro el roble observatory of the university of chile .",
    "to ensure sufficient targets for the observing runs , we schedule sn search runs with the maksutov camera at cerro el roble @xcite , prior to the follow - up runs . with photographic film",
    "this camera permits us to sample a wide field of view ( 5@xmath6 x 5@xmath6 ) down to a limiting magnitude of 18 . with this setup",
    "the photographic survey finds sne up to @xmath4=0.08 , which are ideally suited for the follow - up program .",
    "we also coordinate the follow - up runs with the nearby galaxies supernova survey ( ngss ) carried out with the kitt peak 0.9-m telescope and the wide field mosaic ccd array , which discovers sne down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath721 ( @xmath4@xmath50.15 ) @xcite .",
    "we include in our list of targets sne found at other observatories and reported to the iau circulars .",
    "in the course of 1999 - 2000 the soirs program has gathered high - quality observations for @xmath820 sne . in this paper",
    "we report observations of one of the best - observed objects included in our program , the type ii sn  1999em discovered on 1999 october 29 ( jd 2451480.94 ) in the course of the lick observatory supernova search @xcite .",
    "the supernova occurred in ngc  1637 , a spiral galaxy with a heliocentric radial velocity of 717 km  s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a pre - discovery image of ngc  1637 taken on october 20.45 showed nothing at the position of sn  1999em ( with a limiting magnitude of @xmath819.0 ) , which indicated that the sn had been caught at an early stage . an optical spectrum taken",
    "one day later ( october 30.34 ) showed that sn  1999em had the h line p - cygni profiles characteristic of a type ii event .",
    "the blue continuum and the presence of the he i @xmath105876 line confirmed that sn  1999em had been found at an early epoch @xcite .",
    "given its proximity and early evolutionary stage , sn  1999em proved to be an excellent target to test the `` expanding photosphere method '' ( epm , hereafter ) in detail , and determine the distance to the host galaxy .",
    "the discovery of sn  1999em occurred right in the middle of a soirs observing campaign previously scheduled for 1999 october - december .",
    "as soon as the discovery of sn  1999em was reported , we decided to initiate a follow - up program in order to obtain high - quality data for this event . during this observing run",
    "we obtained superb optical and ir sampling of the first 180 days of the @xmath11 light - curves , as well as optical / ir spectroscopy for the first 60 days of the evolution of sn  1999em . except for the sub - luminous / peculiar sn  1987a",
    ", this object is the best observed event of the type ii class to date .",

    "we proceed to compute the distance correction factors from the sn  ii atmosphere models published by eastman , schmidt , & kirshner ( 1996 , e96 hereafter ) . in appendix",
    "d we define the @xmath12 photometric system and we list magnitudes for the standards that we used in our observations .",
    "we obtained extensive optical and ir photometric follow - up of sn  1999em covering 180 days from discovery until the sn went behind the sun .",
    "the data will be presented in a separate paper by suntzeff et al .",
    "table 1 lists additional @xmath13 observations taken with the ctio  1.5-m , so  1.5-m , so  2.3-m , and eso ntt telescopes .",
    "we include in this table @xmath12-band photometry gathered with the ctio  0.9-m and reduced relative to a photometric sequence properly calibrated with respect to the standards listed in appendix d. in what follows we adopt a minimum photometric error of 0.015 mag in order to account for photometric uncertainties beyond the photon statistics quoted by suntzeff et al .",
    "figure [ ubvrizjhk.fig ] presents the light - curves which reveal the exceptional sampling obtained .",
    "the @xmath14 light - curve shows that maximum light occurred just after discovery , on jd 2451482.8 ( october 31 ) , followed by a phase of rapid decline during which the sn dimmed by @xmath84 mag in 70 days .",
    "the faintness of the sn made further observations through the @xmath14 filter difficult .",
    "the @xmath15 light - curve shows that maximum occurred two days later than in @xmath14 , a rapid decline for @xmath830 days during which the sn dimmed by @xmath81 mag , a phase of 70 days of slowly - decreasing luminosity ( plateau ) during which the flux decreased by one additional magnitude , a fast drop in flux by 2.5 mag in only 30 days , and a linear decay in magnitude as of jd 2451610 that signaled the onset of the nebular phase .",
    "the @xmath16 light - curve was characterized by a plateau of nearly - constant brightness that lasted @xmath8100 days ( until jd 2451590 ) , followed by a drop of 2 mag in @xmath830 days , and a linear decline at the slow pace of @xmath80.01 mag day@xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath12 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 light - curves had the same basic features of the @xmath16 light - curve , except that the sn gradually increased its luminosity during the plateau .",
    "the brightening increased with wavelength , and reached 0.5 mag in the @xmath21 band .",
    "barbon , ciatti , & rosino ( 1979 ) divided type ii sne into two main subclasses according to their photometric behavior in blue light .",
    "the observations of sn  1999em clearly show that this object belongs to the `` plateau '' ( sne  ii - p ) group , the most frequent type of sne  ii , as opposed to the `` linear '' ( sne  ii - l ) class which is characterized by a rapid post - maximum decline in brightness .",
    "figure [ colors.fig ] shows some of the color curves of sn  1999em .",
    "they all reveal the reddening of the sn due to the cooling of its atmosphere . in @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "the reddening was more pronounced due to the many metal lines which depressed the sn flux at the wavelengths sampled by the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "the @xmath24 color , on the other hand , was less affected by line blanketing and better sampled the continuum emission .",
    "the evolution of sn  1999em in this color showed rapid cooling during the first 50 days , after which @xmath24 remained nearly constant for another @xmath830 days . during this phase ,",
    "the photosphere was near the hydrogen recombination surface and was then of nearly constant temperature ( e96 ) .",
    "the end of the plateau phase at jd 2451590 coincided with a sudden reddening of the sn , while the exponential tail was characterized by a nearly constant @xmath24 color .",
    "we obtained optical and ir spectra of sn  1999em with the eso ntt / emmi at la silla and vlt / isaac at cerro paranal between 1999",
    "november 2 and november 28 , and additional optical spectra with the ctio  1.5-m telescope on october 30 ( one day after discovery ) , and the so bok 2.3-m telescope and boller & chivens spectrograph on december 16 and december 31 .",
    "table 2 presents a journal of the observations .",
    "the ntt observations employed three different setups .",
    "we used the blue channel of emmi equipped with a tek ccd ( 1024x1024 ) and grating 5 ( 158 lines mm@xmath9 ) which , in first order , delivered spectra with a dispersion of 3.5    pix@xmath9 and a useful wavelength range between 3300 and 5250  . with the red channel ,",
    "ccd tek 2048 , and grating 13 ( 150 lines mm@xmath9 ) the dispersion was 2.7    pix@xmath9 and the spectral coverage ranged from 4700 through 11000   in first order . since this setup had potential second - order contamination beyond @xmath86600   we decided to take one spectrum with the og530 filter and a second observation without the filter , in order to provide an overlap with the blue spectrum .",
    "thus , a single - epoch observation usually consisted of three spectra . on two occasions ( november 3 and november 14 ) however , we were unable to obtain the observation with the og530 filter , so the red end of the spectra were most likely contaminated by second - order blue light ( more below ) .",
    "the observations with emmi started with calibrations during day time ( bias and dome flat - field exposures ) .",
    "the night began with the observation of a spectrophotometric standard [ from the list of hamuy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ] through a wide slit of 10 arcsec , after which we observed the sn with a slit of 1 arcsec .",
    "we took two exposures per spectral setup , each of the same length ( typically 120 - 180 sec ) and always along the parallactic angle . immediately following this observation we observed a he - ar lamp , at the same position of the sn and before changing the optical setup in order to ensure an accurate wavelength calibration . at the end of the night",
    "we observed a second flux standard .",
    "we carried out all reductions using iraf .",
    "they consisted in subtracting the overscan and bias from every frame .",
    "next , we constructed a flat - field from the quartz - lamp image , duly normalized along the dispersion axis .",
    "we proceeded by flat - fielding all of the object frames and extracting 1-d spectra from the 2-d images .",
    "we followed the same procedure for the he - ar frames which we used to derive the wavelength calibration for the sn .",
    "we then derived a response curve from the two flux standards , which we applied to the sn spectra in order to get flux calibrated spectra . during this process",
    "we also corrected for atmospheric extinction using an average continuum opacity curve scaled for the airmass at which we observed the object , but we did not attempt to remove telluric lines . from the pair of flux - calibrated spectra that we secured for each spectral setup we removed cosmic rays and bad pixels , and obtained a clean spectrum of the sn . the last step consisted in merging the three spectra that sampled different wavelength ranges . to avoid discontinuities in the combined spectrum we grey - shifted the three spectra relative to each other .",
    "finally , we computed the synthetic @xmath16-band magnitude from the resulting spectrum ( following the precepts described in appendix b ) and grey - shifted it so that the flux level matched our observed @xmath16 magnitude .",
    "we checked the spectrophotometric quality of the spectra by computing synthetic magnitudes for the @xmath25 bands .",
    "this test showed differences between the synthetic and observed magnitudes of up to 0.03 mag in the @xmath15 and @xmath17 bands , which implies that the relative spectrophotometry at these wavelengths was very good .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath12 synthetic magnitudes , on the other hand , disagreed with the observed magnitudes by up to 0.1 mag , particularly when the blocking filter could not be used ; second - order contamination was as large as 10% at those wavelengths .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of the sn one day after discovery with the ctio  1.5-m telescope and the cassegrain spectrograph , a 1200x800 loral ccd , grating 16 ( 527 lines mm@xmath9 ) and 2 arcsec slit , in first order .",
    "the resulting spectrum had a dispersion of 5.7    pix@xmath9 and useful wavelength coverage of 3300 - 9700  .",
    "second - order contamination was expected beyond 6600   due to first - order 3300   light since we did not use a blocking filter . on two nights we employed the so bok telescope with the boller & chivens spectrograph , a 1200x800 loral ccd , and a 300 lines mm@xmath9 grating which , in first order , produced spectra with a dispersion of 3.6    pix@xmath9 .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 4900 - 9300   on december 16 and 3500 - 7100   on december 31 .",
    "we did not include a blocking filter in the optical path , so it could well be that these spectra were affected by second - order contamination beyond 6600  .",
    "the observing and reduction procedures for the ctio and so spectra were the same as those described above for the ntt data .",
    "figure [ sn99em.opt.fig ] displays the optical spectra in the rest - frame of the sn , after correcting the observed spectra for the 717 km  s@xmath9 recession velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "the strongest sn lines are indicated along with the telluric lines ( by the @xmath26 symbol ) .",
    "the first spectrum , taken on jd 2451481.79 ( 1 day after discovery ) , showed a blue continuum with a @xmath27 color temperature of 15,600 k , p - cygni profiles for the h balmer lines , and the he i @xmath105876 line which is characteristic of sne  ii during their hottest phases .",
    "the expansion velocity from the minimum of the absorption features was @xmath810,000 km  s@xmath9 which is typical of sne  ii during the initial phases .",
    "the presence of the interstellar na i d lines @xmath285890 , 5896 with an equivalent width of @xmath82     suggested substantial interstellar absorption in the host galaxy .",
    "however , there is additional evidence that the sn did not suffer significant extinction ( see sec .",
    "3.3 ) so we did not attempt to correct for dust the spectra of figure [ sn99em.opt.fig ] .    as the sn evolved the atmospheric temperature dropped , the he i @xmath105876 line disappeared , and several new lines became evident , namely , the ca ii h&k @xmath283934,3968 blend , the ca ii triplet @xmath288498,8542,8662 , the na i d blend , and several lines attributed to fe  ii , sc  ii , and ba  ii .",
    "table 3 summarizes the line identifications , their rest wavelengths [ taken from the list of jeffery & branch ( 1990 ) ] , and their wavelengths measured from the absorption minimum .",
    "we include several lines with unknown identifications in this table . by the time of our last spectrum on jd 2451543.76 ( 62 days after discovery ) the @xmath27 color temperature was only 5,000 k , approximately the recombination temperature of h.      we obtained three ir spectra with the vlt / antu telescope at cerro paranal , between november 2 - 28 .",
    "we employed the ir spectro - imager isaac @xcite in low resolution mode ( r@xmath8500 ) , with four different gratings that permitted us to obtain spectra in the @xmath12 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 bands .",
    "we used these gratings in 5@xmath29 , 4@xmath29 , 3@xmath30 and 2@xmath31 order , respectively , which yielded useful data in the spectral ranges 9840 - 11360 , 11090 - 13550 , 14150 - 18180 , and 18460 - 25600  .",
    "the detector was a hawaii - rockwell 1024x1024 array .",
    "a typical ir observation started during daytime by taking calibrations .",
    "we began taking flat - field images using an internal source of continuum light .",
    "we secured multiple on- and off - image pairs with the same slit used during the night ( 0.6 arcsec ) .",
    "we then took xe - ar lamp images ( and off - lamp images ) with a narrow slit ( 0.3 arcsec ) in order to map geometric distortions .",
    "the observations of sn  1999em consisted in a o - s - o - s - o cycle , where o is an on - source image and s is a sky ( off - source ) frame .",
    "given that the angular size of the host galaxy was comparable to the slit length ( 2 arcmin ) , it was not possible to use the classical technique of nodding the source along the slit and it proved necessary to offset the telescope by several minutes of arc to obtain the sky images . at each position we exposed for 200 sec ,",
    "conveniently split into two 100-sec images in order to remove cosmic rays and bad pixels from the final spectra . after completing the o - s - o - s - o cycle we immediately obtained a pair of on - off arc lamp exposures without moving the telescope or changing optical elements to ensure an accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "we then switched to the next grating and repeated the above object - arc procedure until completing the observations with the four setups . for flux calibration",
    "we observed a bright solar - analog star , close in the sky to the sn in order to minimize variations in the atmospheric absorptions ( maiolino , rieke , & rieke 1996 ) .",
    "the selected star was hip 21488 , of spectral type g2v , @xmath16=8.5 , @xmath23=0.6 , and located only 12@xmath6 from the sn ( simbad astronomical database ) . in this case we nodded the object between two positions ( a and b ) along the slit and we took two ab pairs for each grating . to avoid saturating the detector , we took the shortest possible exposures ( 1.77 sec ) allowed by the electronics that controlled the detector .",
    "since the minimum time required before offsetting the telescope was @xmath860 sec , we took ten exposures at each position which provided an exceedingly good signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for the flux standard .",
    "the reductions of the ir data began by subtracting the off - lamp images from the on - lamp flat - field frames , median filtering the multiple flat images , and normalizing the resulting frame along the dispersion axis .",
    "then we divided all of the object images by the normalized flat - field .",
    "the next step consisted in mapping the geometric distortions using the arc lamp taken with the narrow slit .",
    "the emission lines displayed a curvature of a few pixels across the spatial direction of the image . from the narrow - slit arc exposure we obtained sharp emission lines which allowed us to form a 2-d map of the distortions .",
    "we then fit a low - order 2-d polynomial to the line tracings , after which we applied a geometric correction to all of the images obtained during the night .",
    "since the sky background is so large in the ir , a small flat - fielding residual or a patchy sky can introduce large background fluctuations .",
    "this made it necessary to subtract the sky from the 2-d images before attempting to extract the object spectrum .",
    "given that the ir sky changes on short time - scales , we always used the sky image taken immediately before or after the sn frame .",
    "we followed the same procedure for the flux standard .",
    "we then extracted 1-d spectra of the sn and the spectrophotometric standard from the sky - subtracted frames , making sure to subtract residual sky from a window adjacent to the object .",
    "we also extracted a spectrum of the xe - ar frame taken at the same position of the sn , in order to derive a wavelength calibration .",
    "we then combined the multiple spectra of the sn and the standard with a ` minmax ' rejection algorithm that removed deviant pixels from the average at each wavelength .",
    "flux calibration in the ir is in general quite involved because there are no flux standards at these wavelengths . to get around this problem",
    "we adopted the technique described by maiolino et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , which consists in dividing the spectrum of interest by a solar - type star to remove the strong telluric ir features , and multiplying the resulting spectrum by the solar spectrum to eliminate the intrinsic features ( pseudonoise ) introduced by the solar - type star . in its original version",
    "this method used a solar spectrum normalized by its continuum slope , so the object s spectrum was not properly flux calibrated .",
    "more recently ( http://www.arcetri.astro.it/@xmath8maiolino/solar/solar.html ) this technique was modified to incorporate a flux - calibrated semi - empirical spectrum of the sun , so that the object s final spectrum is in flux units .",
    "the adopted spectrum is a combination of the observed solar line spectrum in the @xmath3 bands @xcite and the kurucz solar model with parameters @xmath32=5,777 k , log @xmath33=4.4377 , [ fe / h]=0 , @xmath34=1.5 km s@xmath9 @xcite . in the vega magnitude system ( described in appendix b ) , the solar spectrum has a visual magnitude of -26.752 .",
    "the remaining broad - band magnitudes are listed in table 12 .    before using the solar spectrum we convolved it with a kernel function in order to reproduce the spectral resolution of the solar - analog standard hip 21488 , and",
    "we scaled it down to the equivalent of @xmath16=8.5 which corresponds the the observed magnitude of hip 21488 . from the ratio of this solar spectrum and the observed spectrum of hip 21488 we derived an instrumental response curve which included both the telluric absorption lines and the instrumental sensitivity of isaac .",
    "finally , we multiplied the sn spectrum by the response function to obtain the flux - calibrated sn spectrum .",
    "this technique worked very well to remove telluric lines . on the other hand",
    ", it introduced a small systematic error in the flux calibration of the sn due to departures between the solar spectrum and the actual spectral energy distribution of the solar - analog standard . according to atmosphere models the difference in continuum flux for stars with @xmath32=5,500 and 6,000",
    "k ( which correspond to spectral types g8v - f9v , gray & corbally 1994 ) is smaller than 10% in the nir region .",
    "a g2v star like hip 21488 has the same spectral type of the sun , so its effective temperature must be close ( within @xmath2100 k ) to that of the adopted solar model .",
    "hence , the flux difference between the solar - analog standard and the adopted spectrum should be less than 10% .",
    "the @xmath23=0.6 color of hip 21488 suggests little or no reddening so the sn spectra fluxes are probably accurate to 5% or better .",
    "the result of these operations are four spectra covering the @xmath12 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 bands , which we combined into one final spectrum . given the significant overlap of the @xmath12 and @xmath19 band spectra ,",
    "we were able to grey - shift the @xmath12 spectrum relative to the @xmath19 spectrum . since none of the other spectra overlapped ( due to the strong absorption of telluric lines between the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 bands ) , we shifted them individually by computing synthetic magnitudes ( see appendix b ) and bringing them into agreement with the observed photometry .",
    "figure [ sn99em.ir.fig ] shows the resulting rest - frame spectra of sn  1999em , revealing the exquisite spectral resolution and the superb s / n delivered by isaac .",
    "the first spectrum , taken four days after discovery , showed a few prominent lines , namely he i @xmath1010830 , p@xmath35 , p@xmath36 , b@xmath37 , and b@xmath38 , on top of a blue continuum . the second spectrum ( 20 days after discovery ) showed prominent p@xmath37 and p@xmath38 lines in lieu of the strong he i feature . a few faint lines appeared around 17000  , from higher transitions in the brackett series .",
    "the third spectrum , taken 30 days after discovery , confirmed the presence of these faint lines .",
    "three lines could be seen at @xmath810500   , between p@xmath37 and p@xmath38 .",
    "it is possible that the feature at 10180   was due to the 10327   line of the multiplet 2 of sr ii , which was also observed in sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "the other two lines of the multiplet at 10037 and 10915    were probably blended with p@xmath38 and p@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we can not provide identifications with confidence for the other two features at 10418 and 10549   .",
    "meikle et al .",
    "( 1989 ) identified the c i @xmath1010695 multiplet 1 line in an early - time spectrum of sn  1987a , which might be responsible for the 10549    feature in the sn  1999em spectrum .",
    "they also reported the presence of the he i @xmath1010830 absorption line in late - time spectra of sn  1987a .",
    "it is possible then that the 10418   feature in sn  1999em could be due to he i. table 4 summarizes the line identifications , their rest wavelengths and the values measured from the absorption minima .    given that two of the ir spectra were obtained one day apart from the optical spectra , we were able to combine these observations in figure [ sn99em.optir.fig ] .",
    "this exercise revealed the excellent agreement between the optical and ir fluxes , a result made possible by synthesizing broad - band magnitudes and adjusting the flux scales according to the observed magnitudes .",
    "second - order contamination can be clearly seen in the first - epoch spectrum as a flux excess between 7500 - 10000  .",
    "epm involves measuring a photometric angular radius and a spectroscopic physical radius , from which the sn distance can be derived . in this section",
    "we apply the method to sn  1999em following such order . in appendix",
    "a we summarize the basic ideas behind epm .",
    "the angular radius , @xmath39 , of the sn can be determined from equation [ angdist ] by fitting planck curves [ @xmath40 to the observed magnitudes . with two wavelengths the solution is exact ( two equations and two unknowns ) .",
    "for three or more wavelengths we use the method of least - squares at each epoch to find the color temperature @xmath41 and the parameter @xmath42 that minimize the quantity    @xmath43 ^ 2}{\\sigma_m^2}. \\label{aseqn}\\ ] ]    in this equation @xmath44 is the sn s apparent magnitude in a photometric band with central wavelength @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the corresponding photometric error , @xmath47 is the synthetic magnitude of @xmath48 ( computed with the precepts described in appendix b ) , and @xmath49 is the dust extinction affecting the sn . once @xmath42 is determined from the @xmath50 fit , we solve for @xmath39 using the dilution factor @xmath51 corresponding to filter subset @xmath52 , which we compute from the color temperature using equation [ zetaeqn ] .    using the @xmath0 photometry and adopting a foreground extinction of @xmath53=0.13 ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) and",
    "@xmath54=0.18 for dust absorption in the host galaxy @xcite , we compute @xmath55 and the corresponding angular radius , which are plotted in figure [ ltv.fig ] .",
    "this figure shows that the initial color temperature was @xmath813,000 k and that the sn cooled down for nearly 60 days until reaching a value near 6,500 k. the photosphere remained at this temperature for 30 days more until the end of the plateau phase . in the rapid fall off the plateau ,",
    "the atmosphere cooled to @xmath84,000 k after which the temperature remained nearly constant . at this stage",
    "the sn began the nebular phase and the spectrum was dominated by recombination lines so the color temperature can not be associated with a thermal process . during the initial cooling period of 60 days",
    "the photospheric radius steadily increased as the photosphere was swept outward by the expansion of the ejecta , and then decreased as the wave of recombination moved into the flow with ever - increasing speed .",
    "it is this balance between increasing radius and steady cooling which explains the long plateau of nearly constant luminosity ( top panel ) . following the plateau phase , both the radius and the temperature decreased , leading inevitably to the luminosity drop around day jd 2451580 .",
    "since the radiation field forms at a depth which varies with wavelength ( depending on the value of the absorptive opacity ) , the angular radii derived before corrections for the dilution factors are expected to vary significantly depending on the filters employed in the blackbody fits .",
    "by contrast , the photosphere is defined as the region of total optical depth @xmath56=2/3 , the last scattering surface . since continuum opacity in the optical and nir",
    "is dominated by electron scattering , the opacity is grey , and the photospheric angular radius is not expected to change with wavelength ( e96 ) .",
    "we can check this prediction in figure [ ast.fig ] by comparing the photospheric angular radii derived from filter subsets @xmath57 for the entire plateau phase of sn  1999em .",
    "the relative agreement is excellent ( @xmath55% ) over the first 10 days of sn evolution , after which there is a period of @xmath830 days in which the photospheric radii derived from the three filter subsets disagree by up to 25% . over the following 60 days",
    "the agreement is much better , at the level of 10% .",
    "this test reveals the overall good agreement of the photospheric radii determined from different filters and the good performance of the dilution factors .",
    "the next step in deriving an epm distance involves the determination of photospheric velocities from the sn spectra . to date",
    "the photospheric velocities have been estimated from the minimum of spectral absorption features ( schmidt et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "there are several problems with this approach , however .",
    "first , the location of the line minimum shifts toward bluer wavelengths ( higher velocity ) as the optical depth of the line and the scattering probability increase .",
    "this is a prediction of line profile models in homologously expanding scattering atmospheres [ see fig .",
    "3 of jeffery & branch ( 1990 ) , for example ] , and is also an observational fact as figure [ lines_ew.fig ] demonstrates .",
    "this plot shows the expansion velocities derived from the metal ( sr , ca , fe , na , si ) lines of the spectrum taken on 1999 december 31 , as a function of the equivalent width of the line .",
    "even though it proves difficult to measure line strengths due to the lack of a well - defined continuum , the trend is quite evident in the sense that stronger features yield higher velocities .",
    "it is well known that hydrogen lines ( which are not shown in this plot ) yield much higher expansion velocities than the metal lines in sn  ii spectra due to their high optical depths , but no attention has yet been paid to this effect among the weakest absorptions .",
    "this plot shows that it is possible to incur significant errors if we measure expansion velocities from the minima of absorption features , even from the weakest lines .",
    "second , even if we could extrapolate the observed velocities to zero strength , the inferred velocity would correspond to that of the thermalization surface ( where the radiation field forms ) and not to the photosphere ( the last scattering surface ) .",
    "since the dilution factors computed by e96 correspond to the ratio of the luminosity of the sn model to that of a blackbody with the _ photospheric _ radius of such model ( see appendix c ) , the use of the velocity of the thermalization surface is inappropriate , even though it has been common practice in the past .",
    "third , velocities derived from absorption lines are affected by line blending or possible line misidentifications , both of which can lead to an erroneous estimate of the photospheric velocity .    to get around these problems",
    "we adopt an approach based on cross - correlating the sn spectrum with the models of e96 ( with known photospheric velocities ) using the iraf `` fxcor '' task . before applying this technique to the observed spectra",
    ", we must test it with the model spectra of e96 .",
    "in doing so we cross - correlate models with other models having @xmath27 color temperatures within @xmath21,000 k of each other .",
    "for each pair of models we end up with a relative velocity derived from the cross - correlation ( cc , hereafter ) technique which can then be compared with the actual value .",
    "the hope is that the whole set of pairs can be used to derive a relationship between the cc relative velocity and the actual value .",
    "we carry out tests separately in the optical and the ir in order to apply this method to spectra observed in different spectral windows . in the optical we select two wavelength ranges ( 3000 - 5000 , 5700 - 6700  ) and a nir a window between 10000 - 13500  .",
    "we end up with these ranges after numerous experiments which show that beyond 13500   there are too few spectral lines to help us constraining the expansion velocity . in the optical",
    "these tests suggest us to eliminate the red wings of the strong h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 , which have the potential to bias the derivation of expansion velocities from the cc procedure .",
    "figure [ cc.fig ] compares the cc relative velocities and the actual values , both in the optical and nir , from the whole set of models ( except for s15.5.1 and s25.5.1 which are not appropriate for sne  ii - p , e96 ) . in both cases",
    "we get a reasonable correlation which permits us to convert the velocity offsets measured from cross - correlation into a photospheric velocity .",
    "the scatter in these relationships is 900 km s@xmath9 which provides an estimate of the precision in the derivation of a photospheric velocity from a single model .",
    "the data can be adequately modeled with straight lines , both in the optical and ir .",
    "least - squares fits yield slopes of 1.18 in the optical and 1.38 in the nir , and zero - points of -3 km s@xmath9 in both cases .",
    "this implies that the magnitude of the relative velocity is _ smaller _ than the actual value .",
    "overall , this is an encouraging result , although it must be mentioned that the points with the largest scatter in figure [ cc.fig ] correspond to pairs with the largest temperatures .",
    "this means that the precision of the cc technique drops to @xmath82000 km s@xmath9 when @xmath58@xmath598,000 k. having come up with a method to estimate photospheric expansion velocities we can proceed to derive velocities for sn  1999em .",
    "we start by selecting atmosphere models with @xmath27 color temperatures within @xmath21,000 k of each observed spectrum , after which we cross - correlate the sn spectrum and the subsample of models in the aforementioned wavelength windows .",
    "the outcome of this operation is a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) with a well - defined peak whose location in velocity space gives the relative velocity of the observed and reference spectrum .",
    "the height of the ccf is a measure of how well the spectral features of the two spectra match each other .",
    "figure [ spec_comp.fig ] shows examples of the cc technique .",
    "panel ( a ) compares the optical spectrum obtained on jd 2451501.66 ( thick line ) with four models of similar color temperature ( thin lines ) , and panel ( b ) shows the corresponding ccfs .",
    "the two models that best match the observed spectrum , p6.60.1 and p6.40.2 , are the ones that give the highest ccf peaks .",
    "models s15.43.3 and s15.46.2 , on the other hand , provide poorer matches to the observed spectrum and , consequently , the lowest ccf peaks . for each cross - correlation",
    "we get a relative velocity which we proceed to correct using the calibrations shown in figure [ cc.fig ] , in order to get the actual relative velocity .",
    "since the photospheric velocities of the models are known , we can derive independent photospheric velocities for each sn spectrum .",
    "table 5 summarizes the velocities derived with this method for all of the spectra of sn  1999em . in this table @xmath60",
    "is the relative velocity determined from the cc method , @xmath61 is the actual relative velocity derived from the calibration provided by the straight lines in figure [ cc.fig ] , and @xmath62 is the photospheric expansion velocity of the sn .",
    "note that , for a given epoch , the expansion velocities derived from different models agree quite well .",
    "table 6 presents the average velocity obtained for each epoch along with the rms value derived from the different models .",
    "note the great agreement in the photospheric velocities determined from optical and ir wavelengths . while the lines used in the different spectral regions form at different depths , the cc technique yields photospheric velocities that do not depend on the wavelength region employed in the cross - correlation , which is the expected behavior for the photosphere .",
    "inspection of table 6 shows that the scatter in velocity yielded by multiple cross - correlations varies between 5 - 21% .",
    "the errors in the average velocities are probably smaller than the tabulated values because we make use of various models to compute such averages .    for comparison",
    "we include in table 6 velocities determined from the conventional method of measuring the wavelength of weak absorption lines .",
    "following the approach of schmidt et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we list velocities measured from fe ii @xmath105018 and fe ii @xmath105169 ( @xmath63 ) , and from sc ii @xmath105526 and sc ii @xmath105658 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "we include also estimates from all metal lines but the strong calcium features ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this comparison shows that @xmath65@xmath8@xmath63@xmath59@xmath64 .",
    "while @xmath63 and @xmath64 have low internal errors when considered individually , the average derived from multiple weak lines displays considerable scatter .",
    "this demonstrates that the technique of using a few pre - selected weak absorption lines has the potential to produce very different results , so that the internal precision of the fe or sc method must reflect the velocity scatter yielded by all lines , which is @xmath820% .",
    "figure [ vel.fig ] shows a comparison between the velocities derived from measuring the weak metal lines and the cc method . during the first 15 days , line velocities are @xmath820% lower than the cc velocities , after which this difference becomes negligible . in our last - epoch spectrum ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a hint that the velocity derived from absorption lines is higher than that obtained from the cc method , although the difference amounts to only @xmath81@xmath66 .      in this section",
    "we use epm to derive the distance to sn  1999em . in doing",
    "so we adopt the foreground extinction @xmath53=0.13 measured by schlegel et al .",
    "the presence of interstellar na i d in the sn spectrum at the wavelength corresponding to the velocity of the host galaxy with an equivalent width of @xmath82   suggests that additional reddening affected the sn .",
    "according to the correlation between equivalent width and reddening of munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) , sn  1999em was reddened by @xmath67@xmath68@xmath81.0@xmath20.15 .",
    "this estimate is highly inconsistent with the independent estimate of @xmath67@xmath68@xmath690.01 - 0.06 and @xmath67@xmath68@xmath50.11 from theoretical modeling of the spectra of sn  1999em ( baron et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this disagreement suggests that the light of sn  1999em was likely absorbed by a gas cloud with relatively large gas to dust ratio , perhaps ejected by the supernova progenitor in an episode of mass loss .",
    "this example demonstrates the difficulty of using the equivalent width of interstellar lines to estimate dust extinction due to the uncertainty in the calibration .",
    "another example that illustrates the problem of applying the galactic calibration of munari & zwitter to sne is the highly reddened type ia sn  1986 g .",
    "the spectra of this sn revealed interstellar na i d absorption with an equivalent width of 4.1   @xcite which implies @xmath67@xmath82 , yet the reddening yielded by color considerations was @xmath67=0.62 @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we examine the sensitivity of epm to dust for which we adopt a wide range of extinction values between @xmath54=0 - 0.45 mag .",
    "figure [ dist_av.fig ] shows the epm distances derived for eight filter subsets ( from @xmath15 through @xmath21 ) .",
    "this plot reveals that the distance from subset \\{@xmath70 } decreases from 7.4 to 6.2 mpc when the adopted extinction increases from 0 to 0.45 mag .",
    "a similar behavior can be appreciated from filters \\{@xmath27}. from \\{@xmath0 } we find that the distance changes only from 7.6 to 7.0 mpc , i.e. , epm is very insensitive to our choice of @xmath54 when observing with these filters .",
    "this trend reverses with subsets including the ir filters , i.e. , the distance gets bigger as the adopted extinction increases .",
    "this plot shows empirically that the epm distances are quite robust to the effects of extinction .",
    "the other interesting feature of this plot is that these curves show a convergence toward small values of @xmath54 , which allows us to constrain the value of the extinction in the host galaxy . in what follows",
    "we adopt @xmath54=0.18 which is the most likely value derived by baron et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and , as figure [ dist_av.fig ] shows , is also consistent with the epm analysis .",
    "tables 7 - 10 summarize the epm quantities derived for sn  1999em using eight filter subsets .",
    "the photospheric velocities come from the polynomial fit to the velocities obtained from the cc technique ( the solid line in figure [ vel.fig ] ) , to which we assign a statistical uncertainty of 5% .",
    "the color temperature @xmath41 and the quantity @xmath42 correspond to parameters obtained from the @xmath50 minimizing procedure described in sec .",
    "3.1 ( equation [ aseqn ] ) , which allows us to estimate statistical uncertainties in the derived parameters from the photometric errors . also listed in these tables is the dilution factor @xmath51 required for the derivation of the @xmath71 quantity needed for epm . in the models of e96 , this factor is primarily determined by temperature and , for a given temperature , @xmath51 changes only by 5 - 10% over a large range of other parameters .",
    "this is a remarkable result , permitting us to compute @xmath51 for sn  1999em without having to craft specific atmospheric models . using this approximation and the derived color temperature ,",
    "we compute @xmath51 from the polynomial fits to the dilution factors for our photometric system ( appendix c ; equation [ zetaeqn ] ) . with this approach",
    "we expect a component of systematic error ( @xmath85 - 10% ) in @xmath71 .",
    "since this is not a statistical uncertainty , we do not include it in the error quoted for @xmath71 in tables 7 - 10 .",
    "figure [ sn99em.epm1.fig ] shows @xmath39@xmath72 as a function of time , for four subsets including filters @xmath15 through @xmath12 .",
    "the open dots show @xmath73 uncorrected for dilution factors while the filled dots show the parameter after correction . in theory",
    ", @xmath73 should increase linearly with time ( except for the very first days after explosion ) and the slope of the relation gives the distance ( equation [ diseqn ] ) .",
    "overall , this figure reveals that the dilution factors produce distances with reasonable consistency during a period of 70 days of sn evolution in which the photospheric temperature dropped from 15,000 to 5,000 k , although it is evident that there are systematic departures from linearity . in particular , the earliest points provide evidence that the angular radius is too large relative to the physical size implied by homologous expansion of the photosphere from a point .",
    "this suggests that the progenitor s radius ( @xmath74 ) might have a non - negligible contribution to the sn radius in the first observations ( obtained a few days after shock breakout ) .",
    "a week after explosion @xmath74 becomes negligible , even for the largest red supergiants known ( @xmath74=300@xmath75 , van belle et al .",
    "1999 ) , so its effect in the determination of the distance can be ignored .",
    "hence , we proceed now to fit the data with a straight line using equation [ diseqn ] , and in the next section we review the validity of this approximation .    to compute the distance it suffices , in principle , to perform a least - squares fit to the ( @xmath76,@xmath77 ) points . to perform such fit",
    "it is necessary to know the uncertainty in each of the @xmath76 points . in our case",
    "this is rendered difficult by our lack of knowledge of the systematic errors in @xmath51 which is needed to obtain the @xmath73 parameter . by weighting the fits by the errors , the fits are going to be biased significantly to the earlier data which carry a lot of weight .",
    "equal weighting seems to be a more reasonable way to derive an `` average '' distance . to estimate the uncertainties in the distance and explosion time we employ the bootstrap technique described by press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) which makes use of the data themselves as an estimator of the underlying probability distribution ( which we do not know ) .",
    "the method consists in randomly drawing from the parent population a synthetic dataset of the same size as the parent . by drawing points with replacement",
    "we end up with a randomly modified dataset , from which we perform a uniform - weight least - squares fit in order to solve for the time of explosion @xmath78 and the distance @xmath79 . from a large number ( 10,000 ) of simulations we obtain average parameters and estimates of the uncertainties in @xmath78 and @xmath79 from the dispersion among the many bootstrap realizations .",
    "the ridge lines in figure [ sn99em.epm1.fig ] correspond to the solutions determined from the bootstrap method and the results of the fits are given in table 11 .",
    "the range in distance ( 6.9 - 7.8 mpc ) derived from observing through these four filter subsets is quite small ( @xmath26% ) .",
    "this shows the good performance of the dilution over the broad wavelength range encompassed by the @xmath80 filters .",
    "the nominal error yielded by the bootstrap method for the individual subsets ranges between 1 - 2% , which proves significantly smaller than the 6% distance range encompassed by the four subsets .",
    "most likely , this is a symptom of systematic errors in the dilution factors .",
    "figure [ sn99em.epm2.fig ] shows @xmath39@xmath72 as a function of time from filter subsets including ir wavelengths .",
    "the scatter from the ridge line is somewhat higher than that obtained from optical wavelengths due to the relatively larger photometric errors in the ir .",
    "this problem becomes even stronger for the @xmath81 subset because the errors in the derived color temperatures increase as the rayleigh - jeans limit is approached . despite the larger scatter in the distances derived from ir observations ,",
    "this plot confirms the internal consistency of the dilution factors computed by e96 from ir wavelengths .",
    "the fits to the data are listed in table 11 which shows that the resulting distances are quite consistent with those derived from optical observations , although the differences are somewhat larger than the formal errors ( more below ) .",
    "we include also in table 11 a solution derived from a simultaneous least - squares fit to all of the @xmath71 values in tables 7 - 10 .",
    "not surprisingly , the resulting distance of 7.54 mpc is close to the value of 7.75 mpc obtained from taking a straight average of the eight individual distances .",
    "we prefer the former estimate because it weighs the distances of the individual subsets according to their time sampling of the @xmath71 parameter .",
    "also given in table 11 is the distance of 7.82 mpc determined from subset @xmath82 .",
    "in this case we must restrict the sample of @xmath83 values to those epochs in which we obtained simultaneous observations with all six filters .",
    "thus , the solution is not weighted by the higher frequency of the optical observations so the result is very close to the value of 7.75 mpc obtained by averaging the individual distances yielded by the eight subsets . in what follows",
    "we adopt the value of 7.54 mpc which takes into account the better sampling of the optical light curves .",
    "the values derived for the explosion time are listed in table 11 .",
    "the average from the eight filter subsets is jd 2451478.8 ( @xmath21 day ) .",
    "this confirms that the sn was caught at a very young stage and that our first photometric and spectroscopic observation was obtained at an age of only three days after shock breakout .",
    "this is far earlier than any other sn , except for sn  1987a .",
    "one of the challenges of epm involves the determination of photospheric velocities .",
    "the spectra of sn  1999em show that the technique of cross - correlating the sn spectra with the models of e96 can produce expansion velocities with an average uncertainty of 11% .",
    "this is significantly lower than the 20% precision yielded by the method of measuring velocities from the minimum of weak absorption features ( table 6 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation technique is not only more precise , but also more accurate , since the velocity derived from individual lines tend to correspond to the value of the thermalization surface , which expands more slowly than the photosphere ( the last scattering surface ) . a clear advantage of the cc method is that it can be used during the initial hot phases of sn evolution when no weak lines are available .",
    "the other advantage of the cc technique is that it permits one to estimate velocities from lower s / n spectra , thus extending the potential of epm to high redshifts where high - quality spectra are difficult to obtain .",
    "the effects of dust extinction can seriously hamper the determination of distances when using `` standard candle '' techniques .",
    "epm , on the other hand , is quite robust to the effects of dust absorption as pointed out by e96 and by schmidt et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "while extinction reduces the observed flux , it also makes the photosphere appear cooler and hence less luminous , so that these two effects cancel to a significant degree .",
    "the data of sn  1999em provide empirical confirmation that the epm distance to this sn is not very sensitive to the adopted absorption .",
    "we find that while the epm distances derived from optical colors decrease with increasing @xmath54 , this trend reverses when using ir filters ( figure [ dist_av.fig ] ) .",
    "this analysis reveals that , even though ir photometry is less affected by dust , the epm distances derived from filter subsets including one or more ir filters are not less sensitive to dust than those determined from optical filters alone .",
    "this result challenges the suggestion of schmidt et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , namely , that one of the advantages of using ir for epm is that `` the uncertainty in a distance due to extinction is less than half that incurred when optical photometry is used '' .",
    "our analysis shows that the \\{vi } and \\{vz } subsets have the least sensitivity to the effects of dust . in particular , the distances derived with the \\{vi } filters vary by a mere 7% when the adopted absorption is varied in a wide range of values between 0 - 0.45 mag .",
    "the other interesting result is that , despite the weak sensitivity of epm to dust , multi - color observations can be useful for constraining @xmath54 .",
    "epm has the great advantage that observations at different epochs are essentially independent distance measurements .",
    "the exceptional data obtained for sn  1999em afford a unique opportunity to perform this valuable internal check and test the dilution factors of e96 over a wide range in temperature and wavelength .",
    "figures [ sn99em.dist.res1.fig ] and [ sn99em.dist.res2.fig ] show that the epm distance ( in units of the average value of 7.54 mpc obtained from the eight filter subsets ) varies systematically over time ( the error of one point is highly correlated to the error in the next point ) .",
    "this problem is particularly pronounced over the first week since explosion ( jd 2451478.8 ) , in which the distances prove even 50% lower than the average owing to the large photometric angular radius relative to the physical size of the sn .",
    "there are different possible causes for this discrepancy which we proceed to examine .",
    "the high degree of correlation in the errors derived from the different filter subsets suggests that the small linear radius might be due to an underestimate of the photospheric velocity .",
    "if this was the case the expansion velocity in the first observation epoch ( jd 2451481.79 ) would have to be 50% higher than the adopted value .",
    "this is well beyond the @xmath85% uncertainty in the cc technique , so we can rule out errors in the photospheric velocities as the source of this discrepancy .",
    "another possible cause for the large initial distance residuals is the neglect of the initial radius @xmath74 in the linear size of the sn . to examine this issue in detail , figure [ all.fig ]",
    "shows how @xmath73 changes with time in a log - log scale , for the eight filter subsets .",
    "overplotted are the lines corresponding to homologous expansion ( equation [ gendiseqn ] ) for the case of a progenitor with @xmath74=0 ( solid line ) and @xmath74=5@xmath8410@xmath85 cm ( dotted line ) , which is 2@xmath84 larger than the largest supergiant known @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the two models are almost identical at later times ( when the effects of @xmath74 in the sn radius become negligible ) , and that they both fit the data very well after day 7 .",
    "the earliest points , on the other hand , all fall on the high side of the lines of homologous expansion .",
    "this plot shows that , while the initial radius of the sn progenitor can account for some of the high @xmath73 values observed at the earliest epochs , there must be other reasons to explain the relatively large angular size of the sn .",
    "we can not rule out , of course , that the large initial residuals are due to incorrect dilution corrections which would act to increase the derived values of @xmath39 .",
    "for this to be true , the dilution corrections for all filter subsets should be increased by 2@xmath84 .",
    "it is conceivable that such error could be caused by circumstellar material which could lead to the formation of the photosphere at a much larger radius .",
    "this is an interesting possibility that could be clarified with an expanded set of atmosphere models for sne  ii .",
    "leaving aside the origin of the high initial distance residuals it is interesting to ask what is their effect in the derived distance to sn  1999em .",
    "for such purpose we employ equation [ gendiseqn ] to solve simultaneously for @xmath74 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "a least - squares fit to the data , however , yields a degenerate and non - physical solution for the three parameters , most likely caused by the large residuals of the earliest points which demand an extremely large @xmath74 . if , instead , we fix @xmath74 to the value of a very large progenitor , 5@xmath8410@xmath85 cm , we obtain a modest increase of 4% in the distance .",
    "alternatively , we now ask what would be the distance if we exclude the first observations . limiting the dataset to epochs later than jd 2451485.7 ( one week after explosion ) , a linear fit yields @xmath79=7.40@xmath20.09 mpc and @xmath78=2451479.7@xmath20.5 , which are indistinguishable than the values derived from the entire dataset .",
    "after day 7 ( jd 2451485 ) the scatter in the epm distances is much lower : 9% in @xmath86 , 4% in @xmath87 , 4% in @xmath88 , and 4% in @xmath89 .",
    "inspection of figure [ sn99em.dist.res1.fig ] shows that the residuals vary systematically over time .",
    "if these were caused by the adopted velocity the effect would be the same in the different filter subsets , which is not the case .",
    "we believe , instead , that the problem lies in the derived photospheric angular radii .",
    "in fact , figure [ ast.fig ] reveals discrepancies of up to 10% in the values of @xmath39 obtained from different filter subsets .",
    "it could well be that these residuals are caused by the use of average dilution factors which , according to e96 , have errors between 5 - 10% .",
    "systematic errors in the photometry could also explain the discrepancies in @xmath39 .",
    "although the nominal uncertainties due to photon statistics are @xmath80.015 mag , the transformation of instrumental magnitudes to the standard system could have significant systematic errors owing to the non - stellar nature of the sn spectrum @xcite . in the ir",
    "the rms in the epm distances after day 7 are 10% in @xmath90 , 10% in @xmath91 , 9% in @xmath92 , and 27% in @xmath81 . in theses",
    "cases the observational uncertainties are partially responsible for these relatively greater spreads , although it is evident that the epm distances are systematically higher than the average and that they decrease steadily with time .",
    "we believe that this trend could be caused by systematic errors in the dilution factors or the photometry .    the distance residuals shown in figures [ sn99em.dist.res1.fig ] and [ sn99em.dist.res2.fig ] reveal the potential problem of applying epm to sne  ii with small time baseline light curves .",
    "to illustrate this point we compute distances for sn  1999em using the data subset comprising the first days of sn evolution ( up to jd 2451490 ) , which yields @xmath93=10.34 , @xmath94=9.70 , @xmath95=10.24 , @xmath96=9.95 , @xmath97=13.26 , @xmath98=13.98 , @xmath99=14.46 , and @xmath100=20.78 mpc .",
    "note that these distances are much higher than the 7.54 mpc average value , whereas figures [ sn99em.dist.res1.fig ] and [ sn99em.dist.res2.fig ] show that the epm distances in the first week are on the low side from the average !",
    "this difference turns out to be a consequence of the shallower slope displayed by the early - time points in figures [ sn99em.epm1.fig ] and figures [ sn99em.epm2.fig ] .",
    "a shallower slope implies a greater distance ( equation [ diseqn ] ) , despite the fact that the individual points imply smaller distances owing to their relatively larger photospheric angular radii .",
    "this test reveals that a `` snapshot '' distance based only on a small time baseline light curve is clearly inappropriate .",
    "poorly sampled light curves , on the other hand , do not seem to be a problem .",
    "we checked this by randomly drawing three data points from the @xmath88 dataset . from 100 realizations the computed distances fall within 10% of the distance derived from the entire dataset ( on average ) . for five data",
    "points the distribution of distances has an rms of 6% around the mean , while for ten points the rms drops to only 4% .",
    "this implies that poorly - sampled light curves can yield precise distances , as long as the spacing in time is reasonable .",
    "schmidt et al . ( 1992 ) made the claim that one of the advantages of using ir photometry for epm is that the @xmath3 bands have fewer spectral features ( which can be checked in figure [ sn99em.optir.fig ] ) , making it easier to derive a color temperature from broad - band photometry .",
    "they also pointed out also that , despite the advantage of there being many fewer lines in the ir , measuring the color temperature from ir photometry is more difficult than in the optical since the spectrum is close to the rayleigh - jeans limit .",
    "this could be particularly severe if the ir photometry has lower precision than that at optical bands .",
    "our ir data confirm this concern , i.e. , the angular radii derived from filters @xmath3 have substantially higher scatter leading thus to a much less ( 5@xmath84 ) precise distance estimate than that obtained from optical wavelengths .",
    "filter subsets involving a combination of one ir filter and one optical filter do not suffer from the proximity to the rayleigh - jeans limit , yet the epm distances have precisions which are 2@xmath84 lower than those including optical filters alone .",
    "this lower precision is a symptom of the larger ir photometric errors .",
    "unfortunately , most of the ir photometry of sn  1999em was obtained with the yalo / andicam camera which suffered from significant vignetting that introduced illumination variations @xmath850% in all of the images ( suntzeff et al .",
    "this made necessary to apply large photometric corrections to the sn and the field standards .",
    "considering these problems , it is not surprising that the internal precision of epm appears lower from subsets @xmath101 , yet it is encouraging that the ir results are consistent with those obtained from optical wavelengths . for a better assessment of the performance of the dilution factors in the ir",
    "it will be necessary to obtain data with smaller observational errors .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the initial points ( up to jd 2451490 ) obtained with the lco 1-m ir camera show a much smaller spread , comparable to optical photometry ( 1 - 2% ) , which demonstrates the potential precision that can be reached with ir photometry .",
    "our guess is that , for a dataset obtained under normal circumstances , @xmath92 would work the best because the errors in temperature are very small for a given level of photometric errors ( see figure [ t_color.fig ] ) .",
    "table 11 shows that the distances yielded by subsets @xmath102 from the first 70 days of sn evolution lie between 6.9 - 8.6 mpc .",
    "the lowest value corresponds to that yielded by subset @xmath86 , which disagrees from the rest if we consider the formal uncertainty of 1 - 2% yielded by the bootstrap method .",
    "as discussed above , these discrepancies are possibly caused by errors in the dilution corrections .",
    "they could be due to metallicity effects which are expected to be relatively stronger in the @xmath15 band due to line blanketing at these wavelengths .",
    "it could well be that the metallicity of sn  1999em was lower than the solar value adopted by e96 ( as suggested by baron et al .",
    "2000 ) , thus increasing its @xmath15-band observed flux relative to the models and making the distance to appear lower .",
    "the largest value in table 11 is due to @xmath81 which has a substantial uncertainty of 8% associated to it , mainly due to the lower precision in the yalo ir data and the proximity to the rayleigh - jeans limit .",
    "the distances derived from @xmath101 appear 9% higher ( 1 - 3@xmath66 ) than the those derived from optical wavelengths .",
    "we investigate two possible causes for this systematic effect .",
    "first , since most of our ir data come from the yalo telescope , whereas the adopted filter functions for the epm analysis correspond to those used with the lco ir camera ( appendix b ) , we repeat here the epm calculations using the yalo @xmath3 filter tracings .",
    "we obtain @xmath97=8.27 , @xmath98=7.77 , @xmath99=8.22 , @xmath100=7.72 mpc , which prove insignificantly different than the values listed in table 11 .",
    "second , since the epm distances shown in figures [ sn99em.dist.res1.fig ] and [ sn99em.dist.res2.fig ] change over time , we examine now the possibility that the optical distances might differ from those derived from @xmath101 due to the different sampling of the sn evolution . by restricting the optical sample to a subset with the same time sampling of the ir observations we get @xmath93=6.81 , @xmath95=7.39 , @xmath94=7.44 mpc , which are negligibly different than the solutions obtained from the entire optical dataset .",
    "these two tests confirm the existence of a systematic difference between optical and ir distances .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate whether or not these discrepancies persist from other sne  ii with better ir data .",
    "altogether , table 11 shows that the internal precision in the average distance must lie between a minimum of 2% ( the formal statistical error from an individual filter subset ) and a maximum of 7% ( the actual scatter obtained from the eight subsets ) . adopting the average solution yielded by the eight filter subsets",
    "our best estimate for the distance to sn  1999em is @xmath79@xmath103=7.5@xmath20.5 mpc .",
    "we can not rule out systematic errors beyond this estimate .",
    "leonard et al . ( 2000 ) has recently done a detailed multi - epoch spectropolarimetric study of sn  1999em which suggests a minimum asphericity of @xmath87% during the plateau phase .",
    "their lower limit could overestimate the distance by 7% for an edge - on view , or lead to an underestimate of 4% for a face - on line - of - sight . from a lower",
    "limit it proves difficult to ascertain the actual effect on our distance estimate .",
    "it is reassuring , on the other hand , the good agreement between epm , tully - fisher and cepheid distances found from a sample of 11 galaxies @xcite , which suggests that the asphericity factor is probably small among sne  ii - p .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by leonard et al . who used the distance residuals in the sn  ii hubble diagram derived by schmidt et al .",
    "to estimate an average asphericity for sne  ii - p of only 10% . this value will be constrained even more as the hubble diagram is populated with well - measured epm distances .",
    "one possibility to test the overall accuracy is to compare our epm distance to other methods .",
    "there is a distance estimate to ngc  1637 of 7.8@xmath104 mpc based on the brightness of red supergiants @xcite which compares with our epm distance of @xmath79@xmath103=7.5@xmath20.5 mpc .",

    "this value is somewhat larger than that derived from our epm analysis but , it must be kept in mind that the h i velocity width and inclination for ngc  1637 are quite uncertain because of its lopsidedness .",
    "certainly , it would be very useful to have a precise cepheid distance to ngc  1637 , in order to further test the dilution factors of e96 and the epm result .",
    "the observations of sn  1999em and the epm analysis of this paper demonstrate that it is possible to achieve epm distances with _ internal _ precisions of 7% from optical observations .",

    ". we can not rule out errors in the dilution factors as the source of the problem .",
    "it is conceivable that such error could be caused by circumstellar material which could lead to the formation of the photosphere at a much larger radius . over the following 65 days , on the other hand , our analysis lends strong credence to the models of e96 , and confirms their prediction that the use of average dilution factors can produce consistent distances without having to craft specific models for each sn .",
    "the @xmath88 filter subset shows the greatest internal consistency ( with an average scatter of only 4% ) and the least sensitivity to the adopted dust extinction , making it the most reliable route to cosmic distances .",
    "our tests show that it is necessary to obtain light curves with reasonable spacing in time ( once per week ) in order to avoid systematic biases introduced by the use of average dilution factors .",

    "the differences between the new dilution factors and those of e96 are less than 5% and , not surprisingly , we recover the result that @xmath51 is primarily determined by temperature . for convenience , therefore , we perform polynomial fits to @xmath160 , where    @xmath161    table 14 gives the resulting coefficients @xmath162 for the nine filter subsets and in figure [ zeta.fig ] we compare these fits to the individual @xmath51 factors . following e96 , we remove the peculiar models s15.5.1 , s25.5.1 , and h10.30.1 ( shown with crosses ) , as they are not appropriate models for sne  ii - p .",
    "we define the @xmath12-band as the product of the transmission of the @xmath12 filter ( number 611 ) and the qe of ccd tek36 of the ntt / emmi instrument .",
    "the resulting bandpass also includes telluric lines ( see figure [ filters_zjhk.fig ] ) .",
    "we employ this filter function to compute synthetic magnitudes from the tertiary spectrophotometric standards published by hamuy et al .",
    "however , since these spectra contain telluric lines it is necessary first to remove these features .",
    "then we use equation [ mageqn ] and an _ adopted _ zp of 32.724 that yields a magnitude of 0.03 for vega .",
    "we choose this zp so that @xmath142=0 for vega .",
    "the resulting synthetic magnitudes for the tertiary standards are listed in table 15 and this is the system relative to which we calibrated a photometric sequence around sn  1999em . in hamuy",
    "1994 ) we showed that synthetic magnitudes in the @xmath18 band had typical uncertainties of 0.018 mag .",
    "therefore , we believe that the @xmath12 magnitudes in table 15 have errors of 0.02 mag .",

    "<S> we present optical and infrared spectroscopy of the first two months of evolution of the type ii sn  1999em . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these data with high - quality optical / infrared photometry beginning only three days after shock breakout , in order to study the performance of the `` expanding photosphere method '' ( epm ) in the determination of distances . with this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we develop a technique to measure accurate photospheric velocities by cross - correlating observed and model spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the application of this technique to sn  1999em shows that we can reach an average uncertainty of 11% in velocity from an individual spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that epm is quite robust to the effects of dust . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the distances derived from the @xmath0 filters change by only 7% when the adopted visual extinction in the host galaxy is varied by 0.45 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the superb time sampling of the @xmath1 light - curves of sn  1999em permits us to study the internal consistency of epm and test the dilution factors computed from atmosphere models for type ii plateau supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the first week since explosion , the epm distances are up to 50% lower than the average , possibly due the presence of circumstellar material . over the following 65 days , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , our tests lend strong credence to the atmosphere models , and confirm previous claims that epm can produce consistent distances without having to craft specific models to each supernova . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true for the @xmath0 filters which yield distances with an internal consistency of 4% . from the whole set of @xmath1 photometry </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an average distance of 7.5@xmath20.5 mpc , where the quoted uncertainty ( 7% ) is a conservative estimate of the internal precision of the method obtained from the analysis of the first 70 days of the supernova evolution . </S>"
