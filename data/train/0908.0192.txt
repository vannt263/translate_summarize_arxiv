    "recent observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by various groups such as the cosmic background explore ( cobe ) @xcite , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , and the arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( acbar ) @xcite have provided a refined picture of the history of universe after the big bang .",
    "cosmological parameters are determined with high accuracy based on the cosmological perturbation theory @xcite , assuming only the primordial spectrum close to that of the harrison - zeldovich - peebles @xcite .",
    "we believe that one of the important problems remained in the study of inflation @xcite is to clarify dynamics producing such a scale - invariant spectrum from the fundamental theory rather than introducing an artificial field by hands just for the phenomenological purpose .    as the fundamental theory , we will employ the renormalizable quantum gravity formulated based on the conformal field theory ( cft ) in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "it predicts that quantum fluctuations of the conformal mode in gravitational fields become so large at very high energies beyond the planck scale , and a conformally invariant space - time is realized as a consequence of background metric independence .",
    "it then produces a power - low spectrum and a non - gaussian fluctuation distribution for the theoretical generation of cmb spectrum .",
    "evolution of the early universe can be regarded as a violating process of conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "the conformal symmetry starts to be broken at the planck scale , and the space - time dynamics shifts to the inflationary epoch with the expansion time constant about the planck mass @xmath6 .",
    "the conformal invariance is completely broken at the dynamical scale of quantum gravity @xmath7 , which is expected to be @xmath8gev . at this energy scale , the inflation terminates , and the universe turns to the classical friedmann universe .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify how the harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum is prepared for the initial condition of the cosmological perturbation equation for computing the cmb angular power spectra .",
    "the time evolution of gravitational fluctuations in the inflationary background has been studied within the linear approximation @xcite .",
    "it was shown that during the inflation the amplitude of scalar fluctuation decreases to the size which solves the flatness problem . combining this result with smallness of the non - gaussianity",
    ", we will show that the ` almost ' harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum ( a constant spectrum with rapid fall - off at small momenta ) emerges after the inflation .    the tensor mode which measures a degree of deviation from the conformal invariance",
    "is expected to be small initially because of the asymptotically free behavior of this mode , while its amplitude is preserved during the inflation .",
    "thus , the tensor mode also gives a significant contribution at the later stage in the primordial spectra for the computation of the cmb multipole distribution .",
    "the correlation length of quantum gravity is given by the order of @xmath9 , and it brings the absence of correlations of two points separated larger than @xmath10 initially prepared before the universe starts inflation .",
    "this explains the sharp fall off of the angular power spectra at low multipoles @xcite .",
    "the renormalizable quantum gravity formulated as a perturbed theory from cft is defined by the dimensionless action @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the weyl tensor , @xmath13 is the euler density , and @xmath14 is a dimensionless coupling constant which measures a degree of deviation from cft .",
    "the cosmological constant is denoted by @xmath15 , whose effect can be neglected in the early universe .",
    "@xmath16 represents the lagrangean for conformally invariant matter fields , and @xmath17 is the planck constant which is taken to be unity .",
    "the metric field is decomposed to the conformal mode @xmath18 and the traceless tensor mode @xmath19 as @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "signature of the flat background metric @xmath22 is @xmath23 , which defines the conformal time and the comoving frame with the coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the traceless tensor mode , which is governed by the weyl action , is handled perturbatively in terms of the coupling @xmath14 .",
    "the renormalized coupling constant @xmath26 indicates the asymptotic freedom with the beta function @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "it justifies the perturbative treatment of this mode , and also implies the existence of a dynamical energy scale @xmath7 . the running coupling constant is then written as @xmath28 for a physical momentum @xmath29 .",
    "a recent significant progress in quantization techniques is that the conformal mode has been managed non - perturbatively , as in the case of two - dimensional quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "when we rewrite the diffeomorphism invariant measure in terms of the practical measures defined on the flat background metric @xmath22 , the partition function is expressed as @xmath30_\\eta \\exp ( is+ii ) $ ] .",
    "the induced action @xmath31 is the jacobian needed to recover the diffeomorphism invariance . at the lowest order of the coupling @xmath26",
    ", it gives the kinetic term of the conformal mode , called the riegert action @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a conformally invariant fourth - order differential operator for a scalar field variable .",
    "this action is a four - dimensional counter part of the liouville - polyakov action in two dimensions .",
    "the coefficient has been computed to be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are numbers of scalar fields , weyl fermions , and gauge fields , respectively , and the last term is a quantum loop correction from gravitational fields . since",
    "@xmath38 for various gut models is given about @xmath39 , we consider this case in the following .",
    "there are various proporsals in the past how to treat the problem of ghosts .",
    "for example , tomboulis @xcite proposed that ghosts might be removed in the ir region based on the idea of lee and wick using the resummed propagator in asymptotically free theories .",
    "the idea of asymptotic safety by weinberg @xcite is defined as a cutoff model expanded in derivatives about the ghost - free einstein theory assuming the existence of a non - trivial uv fixed point where the cutoff is taken to be infinity .",
    "recently , horava @xcite proposed a higher - derivative gravity model by making ghosts non - dynamical at the cost of diffeomorphism invariance in the uv limit .",
    "our proposal @xcite is that the problem of ghosts should be reconsidered under the light of cft described by the combined system of the riegert and the weyl actions which appears in the uv limit .",
    "since the conformal symmetry realized as a part of diffeomorphism invariance mixes positive - metric and negative - metric modes of the gravitational field , we can not consider these modes separately and thus the field acts as a whole in physical quantities . at present",
    "we do not have a complete proof on the unitarity problem yet , but there is no unphysical behavior at least within discussions given in this paper .",
    "the quantum gravity cosmology @xcite is now defined by the effective action described by @xmath40 together with higher @xmath26 corrections in which the two mass scales are ordered as @xmath41 . when the universe is at the planck scale , the coupling constant is negligibly small due to the asymptotic freedom , and the equation of motion for the homogeneous component of conformal mode , @xmath42 , is obtained to be @xmath43 we introduce the proper time @xmath44 through @xmath45 with the scale factor @xmath46 . in terms of @xmath47 , where dot represents the proper time derivative , the stable solution",
    "is written as @xmath48 which corresponds to the inflationary universe @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "the constant @xmath51 has a order of the planck scale , and @xmath52 is called planck time in the followings .",
    "as the universe expands , the running coupling constant grows and diverges at the dynamical time scale @xmath53 . at this point ,",
    "the conformal symmetry completely breaks down and quantum coherence of fields disappears resulting the emergence of classical space - time .",
    "the evolution equation incorporating such a space - time dynamics @xcite is effectively obtained by including quantum corrections to the coefficient @xmath38 in equation ( [ homogeneous equation ] ) by @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the higher order corrections are taken into account in the dynamical factor @xmath55 by assuming a resummention form @xmath56 by regarding the energy scale to be the inverse of time in the expanding universe , the time - dependence of @xmath55 is defined by replacing @xmath57 to the running coupling constant @xmath58 , which is a solution of the renormalization group equation @xmath59 .",
    "the equation of motion is then written in terms of the hubble variable as @xmath60 it shows that when the running coupling diverges at @xmath61 , the dynamical factor @xmath55 vanishes , and the transition from the conformal gravity to the einstein gravity occurs , as shown in fig.[evolution of scale factor ] . , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , are determined phenomenologically because they depend on strong - coupling dynamics of the traceless tensor mode . in this paper",

    "this equation shows that the matter density vanishes initially because of @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 , while it increases sharply as @xmath55 vanishes at @xmath61 . the energy which creates matter fields @xmath68 originates from a degree of freedom in the conformal mode .",

    "we here choose @xmath75 which is apropriate to solve the flatness problem , and then the dynamical scale is given by @xmath76gev .",
    "the evolution scenario of the universe based on the quantum gravity cosmology is depicted in fig.[evolution scenario ] .",
    "amplitude of the relative scalar curvature fluctuation , @xmath77 , in the inflationary background is then estimated as follows .",
    "since the curvature has two derivatives , the curvature fluctuation would be order of square of the energy scale .",
    "hence , @xmath78 is about @xmath79 at the transition point , where the denominator is the curvature of inflationary background .",
    "it gives the magnitude about the order of @xmath80 consistent to the observed value by the cobe and wmap .",

    "is expanded up to the hubble distance @xmath82 today .",
    "there is no correlation between two points with a distance larger than @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , two points separated beyond @xmath10 multiplied by the scale factor @xmath83 today lack correlation , and it is our resolution on the sharp fall - off of cmb angular power spectra at large angles . ]",
    "let us describe evolution of the conformal mode starting from the period before inflation to the transition point .",
    "our main concern is to show how the initial power law spectrum propagates to the effective spectrum at the transition point , which serves as the initial spectrum for the classical equation of cosmological perturbation theory .",

    "denoting @xmath86 to be a fluctuation of the conformal mode , the relative scalar curvature fluctuation is written as @xmath87 with the initial conditions @xmath88 . here , @xmath89 is the planck mass at @xmath90 in the comoving frame , where the scale factor of today is normalized to be unity .",
    "the fourier transform of this operator in the comoving momentum is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 up to the second order of @xmath86 .",
    "this expression shows that the so - called local non - gaussianity or non - linearity parameter @xmath93 of the scalar spectrum defined by @xmath94 in the real space @xcite is of the order unity , @xmath95 .",
    "we begin with considering the linear part of the initial scalar spectrum .",
    "prior to the inflation the four - derivative dynamics of the action ( [ wess - zumino action ] ) brings a long range correlation much larger than the horizon distance of the inflationary phase given by the planck length @xmath96 . the equal time",
    "two - point correlation function of the @xmath86 field is written in terms of the logarithmic function as @xmath97 at @xmath90 .",
    "the fourier transform of the logarithmic correlation is given by the formula @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an infinitesimal cut - off and @xmath100 is the euler constant .",

    ", we have to solve the evolution equation for fluctuations .",
    "we first consider linear equations of motion with the initial spectrum ( [ linear spectrum ] ) and see the inflationary solution is stable .",

    "it was known that the non - linear term in ( [ expansion of vphi_nl ] ) tends to shift the scalar spectral index toward blue side from the harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum by the order of the initial amplitude @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "it was shown that within the linear approximation the initial pattern of the spectrum holds for the comoving momentum less than @xmath117 , but it becomes impossible to preserve the power - law behavior for the high momentum region beyond @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the non - linear effect acts to guarantee the power - law behavior of cft beyond the planck scale , and we can expect that the amplitude of scalar fluctuation will get smaller while preserving the power - law behavior during the inflation under the non - linear effect .",
    "although the non - linear distortion of the scalar spectrum is significant initially reflecting that the initial amplitude of @xmath86 is not so small as to be neglected , we can expect from the observation above that a scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum is realized after the inflation as follows .",
    "the amplitude will reduce during the inflation preserving the power - law behavior , while the relationship between the linear and non - linear terms reflected in the order of @xmath95 will be fixed as a consequence of the diffeomorphism invariance ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it implies that , as the scalar amplitude decreases to a small value of order @xmath118 at the transition time , the non - linear terms become negligible to order of square of the amplitude .",
    "therefore , the scalar spectrum will reduce to the harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum @xmath119 , which is an original prediction of the dimensionless field governed by the four - derivative dynamics of conformal gravity .",
    "let us discuss the dynamical effect which is originated from the existence of the correlation length @xmath120 .",
    "this length scale implies the lack of correlation between two points separated beyond the correlation length @xmath10 at the initial stage before the universe starts inflating .",
    "we incorporate this fact to the primordial spectrum through the spectral index which have a quantum correction of order of @xmath121 @xcite . in order to take into account the non - perturbative effect we replace the coupling constant by the running coupling constant @xmath122 .",
    "thus , we obtain the almost harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectrum with the sharp fall - off at @xmath123 , expressed as @xmath124 where we leave the constant @xmath125 as a free parameter and the comoving dynamical scale is defined by @xmath126 similar to the case of the comoving planck mass scale , and thus @xmath127 .",
    "this scale indicates that there is no correlation for fluctuations of the spatial distance larger than @xmath128 today .",
    "since we use the comoving wave number , the physical scale of the fluctuation we consider here becomes much larger than the correlation length at the transition so that the pattern of the spectrum will be printed in the classical universe without modification by the strong coupling dynamics at the phase transition .",

    "it is also described by a dimensionless linear field with logarithmic correlation function . unlike the scalar mode , the amplitude of the tensor mode @xmath130 is preserved during the inflation @xcite so that the spectrum at the transition point is given by @xmath131 where @xmath130 is a small dimensionless constant .",

    "the comoving dynamical scale is chosen to be @xmath145mpc@xmath114 in order to explain the sharp damping at the @xmath146 multipole components .",
    "this value is consistent with the inflationary scenario given in fig.[evolution scenario ] , in which the scale factor grows up about @xmath83 from the planck time to today , and thus we can expect from the definition ( [ comoving dynamical scale ] ) that the comoving dynamical scale becomes this order by taking @xmath76gev as estimated in section 2 .     the te spectrum with the wmap5 data .",

    "however , if there is a time delay in the short scale at the space - time transition , the amplitude for high momentum region reduces further resulting red tilt of the spectrum .",

    "introducing two characteristic mass scales , the number of e - foldings and the scalar amplitude at the transition point have been estimated as about @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "it suggests that the order of dynamical energy scale @xmath7 locates at energy lower than @xmath151 by two orders .",
    "we gave a special attention on the non - linear effects in the power - law scalar spectrum of cft from the viewpoint of diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the local non - gaussianity parameter @xmath93 was evaluated to be the order of unity .",
    "since the relationship between the linear and non - linear terms reflected in this order originates from the diffeomorphism invariance , it is expected to be preserved during the inflation .",
    "it suggests that as the amplitude decreases in the inflation era the scalar spectrum approaches to a scale - invariant one predicted from four - derivative dynamics of dimensionless gravitational fields . in this way",
