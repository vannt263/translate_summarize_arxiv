    "the key properties of nucleation processes are the height @xmath0 of the free energy barrier that must be overcome to form stable embryos of the emerging phase and the nucleation rate @xmath1 that indicates how many nuclei appear in a given volume per time .",
    "the most widespread approach for calculating these quantities is the classical nucleation theory @xcite , which has significant shortcomings , e.g. , it can overestimate @xmath0 significantly for homogeneous vapor to liquid nucleation @xcite . a more accurate theory of homogeneous nucleation , which is sought after ,",
    "would also increase the reliability for more complex applications such as heterogeneous and ion - induced nucleation in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "an important problem of the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) is that the underlying basic assumptions do not apply to nanoscopic nuclei @xcite .",
    "although it is possible to measure the critical size by neutron scattering @xcite , the thermophysical properties of such nuclei are mostly very hard to investigate experimentally .",
    "however , they are well accessible by calculations based on density functional theory @xcite as well as molecular simulation @xcite . for instance , vaporization processes @xcite and equilibria @xcite of single liquid droplets can be simulated to obtain the surface tension as well as heat and mass transfer properties of strongly curved interfaces .",
    "similarly , very fast nucleation processes that occur in the immediate vicinity of the spinodal are experimentally inaccessible , whereas they can be studied by monte carlo @xcite and molecular dynamics @xcite simulation of systems with a large number of particles .",
    "lower nucleation rates are accessible by transition path sampling based methods such as forward flux sampling @xcite . hence",
    ", molecular simulation is crucial for the further development of nucleation theory .",
    "such molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , dealing with single nuclei in equilibrium as well as with homogeneous nucleation processes in supersaturated vapors , led to the formulation of a surface propery corrected ( spc ) modification of cnt for vapor to liquid nucleation of unpolar fluids , cf .",
    "previous work @xcite for a detailed presentation and justification .",
    "both cnt and the spc modification apply the expression @xmath2,\\ ] ] accounting for the positive contribution of the surface tension @xmath3 acting on the surface area @xmath4 as well as a negative bulk contribution , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the chemical potential of the supersaturated and the saturated vapor at the temperature @xmath7 , respectively , to the free energy of formation @xmath8 for a nucleus containing @xmath9 particles .",
    "the maximal free energy of formation @xmath0 , corresponding to the critical size @xmath10 , is the decisive quantity for the nucleation rate , given by the arrhenius equation as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "in addition to the usual collision term from kinetic gas theory , the pre - exponential coefficient @xmath13 includes the zldovi (  ) factor and a correction for thermal non - accomodation @xcite .",
    "although @xmath13 is not constant , it depends to a much lower extent on supersaturation than the exponential term .",
    "cnt applies the capillarity approximation , which in the present context means that @xmath3 is assumed to be the same as the surface tension of the planar vapor - liquid interface @xmath14 .",
    "the surface area is determined from the assumption that all nuclei are spherical .",
    "the spc modification replaces the capillarity approximation with the tolman equation @xcite , @xmath15 wherein @xmath16 is the radius of the nucleus and @xmath17 is the tolman length , a characteristic interface thickness , while the surface area is increased by a steric factor @xmath18 . in particular , the temperature - dependent correlations @xmath19 with respect to the critical temperature @xmath20 , as well as @xmath21 can be used for unpolar fluids @xcite .",
    "a different approach is given by the hale scaling law ( hsl ) .",
    "in agreement with experimental data on nucleation of water and toluene @xcite , it predicts @xmath22 where the proportionality constant only depends on properties of the critical point .",
    "the present work has the objective of refining the methodology used for direct md simulation of nucleation processes . according to the method of yasuoka and matsumoto ( ym ) ,",
    "a supersaturated vapor is simulated in the canonical ensemble and the nucleation rate is obtained from the number of nuclei formed over time , using a linear fit where only nuclei that exceed a sufficiently large threshold size are counted @xcite .",
    "nucleation occurs after the metastable state is equilibrated and before nucleus growth becomes dominant .",
    "however , the timespan corresponding to nucleation is very short for the high nucleation rates that are accessible to direct md simulation , which restricts the statistical basis and the precision of the results . near the spinodal",
    ", the regimes of equilibration , nucleation , and growth even start to overlap and the ym method becomes unreliable .",
    "wedekind _ et al .",
    "_  recently developed a more rigorous method which is based on mean first passage times ( mfpt ) obtained by averaging over hundreds of simulation runs @xcite .",
    "but as chkonia _",
    "et al . _",
    "point out , whereas @xcite .",
    "a new direct equilibrium md simulation method is introduced in the present work .",
    "the underlying concept is to simulate the non - equilibrium as a stationary process in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "thereby , it is possible to sample exclusively nucleation as opposed to nucleus growth and coalescence .",
    "while the precision of the results is increased by maintaining the steady state over an arbitrarily long time interval , the advantages of the ym non - equilibrium method are also retained . in particular ,",
    "only one md simulation run is required and the nucleation rate is obtained from the number of large nuclei formed over time .",
    "this is achieved by combining grand canonical molecular dynamics ( gcmd ) , introduced by @xcite , and an that continuously removes all large nuclei @xcite : mcdonald s demon .",
    "in a closed system , nucleation is an instationary process because the metastable phase is depleted by the emerging nuclei .",
    "the idea behind the present approach is to simulate the production of nuclei up to a given size for a specified metastable state .",
    "nuclei above the given size are extracted , and particles are inserted as monomers into the system to replenish the metastable phase .",
    "gcmd regulates the chemical potential and samples the grand canonical ensemble : alternating with standard md steps , particles are deleted from and inserted into the system probabilistically with the usual grand canonical acceptance criteria @xcite . for a test deletion , a random particle is removed . for a test insertion , the coordinates of an additional particle are chosen at random .",
    "the potential energy difference @xmath23 is determined for each of the test operations and compared with the residual chemical potential .",
    "the acceptance probability is defined the same way as for the metropolis algorithm , i.e. , it is @xmath24 ,              1\\right),\\ ] ] in case of deletions and similar for insertions @xcite . in this expression",
    ", @xmath25 is the density and @xmath26 is the thermal wavelength .",
    "the number of test deletions and insertions per simulation time step was chosen in this work between @xmath27 and @xmath28 times the number of particles .",
    "whenever a nucleus exceeds the specified threshold size @xmath29 , mcdonald s demon @xcite  called szilrd s demon by @xcite  removes it from the system and replaces it by a representative configuration of the metastable phase .",
    "if a dense phase is simulated , this can be achieved by , e.g. , inserting an equilibrated homogeneous configuration in the center of the free volume , followed by preferential test insertions and deletions in the affected region . in a supersaturated vapor , however , the density is usually so low that it is sufficient to leave a vacuum behind as suggested by @xcite .",
    "establishing a steady state by continuously removing the largest nuclei is the purpose and the main advantage of mcdonald s demon .",
    "consequently , the further behavior of these nuclei can not be tracked .",
    "it is assumed that most of the nuclei that are extracted would have continued to grow and that the demon intervention rate @xmath30 is therefore similar to the actual nucleation rate @xmath1 .",
    "the deviation between these rates can also be quantified by regarding the size evolution of a single nucleus in terms of a discrete one - dimensional random walk over the order parameter @xmath9 . at each size transition , @xmath9 is either decreased or increased by one @xcite . the short - term growth probability , corresponding to a size increase in the next step , is then given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the grand canonical partition function under the condition that the nucleus contains @xmath33 particles . neglecting all discrete size effects , the long - term growth probability @xmath34 , which corresponds to the cases where the nucleus never evaporates completely and",
    "thus eventually reaches arbitrarily large sizes , has the property @xcite @xmath35 using adequate boundary conditions , the long - term growth probability of the nuclei that are removed by the demon can be determined as @xmath36 the intervention rate is therefore related to the nucleation rate by @xmath37 in particular , for a threshold size sufficiently above @xmath10 the approximation @xmath38 is valid @xcite .",
    "the truncated - shifted lennard - jones ( tslj ) fluid accurately describes the fluid phase coexistence of noble gases and methane @xcite , avoiding long - range corrections which are tedious for inhomogeneous systems .",
    "homogeneous vapor to liquid nucleation of the tslj fluid was studied here by gcmd simulation with mcdonald s demon at temperatures of 0.65 to 0.95 in units of @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the energy parameter of the lennard - jones potential ) .",
    "note that the triple point temperature of the tslj fluid is @xmath41 = 0.65 while @xmath20 is 1.078 so that the entire relevant temperature range is covered @xcite .",
    "the @xcite criterion was used to discern the emerging liquid from the surrounding supersaturated vapor and nuclei were determined as biconnected components .",
    "figure [ szilii ] shows the aggregated number of demon interventions in one of the present gcmd simulations and , for comparison , the number of nuclei in a md simulation of the canonical ensemble under similar conditions .",
    "the constant value of the supersaturation @xmath42 in the gcmd simulation agreed approximately with the time - dependent @xmath43 in the @xmath44 simulation about @xmath45 = 400 after simulation onset in units of @xmath46 , wherein @xmath47 is the size parameter of the lennard - jones potential and @xmath48 is the mass of a particle .    during the @xmath44 run , however , @xmath43 decreased from about 3 to 1.5 . the observed rate of formation was significantly lower for larger nuclei , which is partly due to the the depletion of the vapor over simulation time .",
    "depletion causes less monomers to interact with a nucleus surface when large nuclei are formed because by that time , a substantial amount of particles already belong to the liquid .",
    "moreover , a small nucleus will eventually decay with a higher probability , given by @xmath49 , instead of growing to arbitrarily large sizes , cf .",
    "( [ eqn : committor ] ) . therefore",
    ", large nuclei are necessarily formed at a lower rate .    in fig .",
    "[ szilvi ] , it can be seen how the decreasing supersaturation in the canonical ensemble md simulation affects the nucleus size distribution .",
    "around @xmath45 = 400 , the distribution of small nuclei present per volume was similar in both simulation approaches .",
    "near and above the critical size , i.e. , 27 particles according to cnt , cf .  tab .",
    "[ tabj ] , deviations arise because of the different boundary conditions . comparing",
    "the distribution for the grand canonical steady state with the corresponding theoretical prediction shows that cnt underestimates the number of nuclei present in the metastable state , confirming the result of @xcite that cnt exaggerates the free energy of nucleus formation .",
    "cnt is also known to underestimate the nucleation rate of unpolar fluids @xcite .",
    "the determined demon intervention rates confirm this conclusion , cf .  tab .",
    "[ tabj ] , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ sziliv ] , the hsl is significantly more accurate than cnt for low temperatures",
    ". for @xmath7 = 0.85 , hsl and cnt lead to similar predictions , deviating from simulation results by two orders of magnitude . at @xmath7 = 0.95",
    ", a nucleation rate of @xmath50 = -16.08 was obtained for @xmath43 = 1.146 ( using @xmath29 > 3 @xmath51 ) where cnt predicts @xmath52 = -19.99 , cf .  tab .",
    "[ tabj ] , as opposed to @xmath53 = -24.27 .",
    "thus , hsl breaks down at high temperatures for the tslj fluid .",
    "present results generally agree with nucleation rates obtained by @xmath54 simulation at temperatures between 0.65 and 0.95 , as can be seen by comparison with the spc modification that was correlated to data from canonical ensemble md simulation @xcite .",
    "figure [ szilvii ] shows how the choice of @xmath29 affects the nucleus temperature .",
    "the largest nuclei allowed to remain in the system have a highly elevated temperature and the amount of nucleus overheating can be explained by considering the boundary condition that mcdonald s demon imposes on size fluctuations .",
    "only nuclei that do not fluctuate to sizes above @xmath29 remain in the system for a significant time .",
    "almost all nuclei with @xmath55 approach the point where overheating due to the enthalpy of vaporization released during condensation countervails the supercooling of the vapor .",
    "note that this effect is much stronger than the overheating @xmath56 of the critical nucleus according to cnt due to nucleation kinetics @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the zldovi factor and @xmath59 is the enthalpy of vaporization , evaluating to @xmath60 = 0.00608 in the present case .    with a threshold far below the critical size , the intervention rate of mcdonald s demon is several orders of magnitude higher than the steady - state nucleation rate , cf",

    "[ tabtheta ] also shows , the density and the pressure of the supersaturated vapor have very good convergence properties with respect to the intervention threshold size and can already be accurately obtained at a high accuracy for @xmath29 values near the critical size .",
    "gcmd with mcdonald s demon was established as a method for steady - state simulation of nucleation processes .",
    "the main purpose of the new method consists in directly simulating a metastable state that undergoes a phase transition at a high rate without being limited to sampling only the short timespan until nucleation occurs .    by implication , growth or decay processes of very large nuclei",
