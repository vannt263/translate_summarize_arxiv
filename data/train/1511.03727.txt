    "thus the dprm problem belongs to the kpz universality class , and its progress reinforces that of kir , as much as _ vice versa_. 2 .   via @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) can be mapped ( for @xmath16 ) into the burgers equation for a randomly stirred vorticity - free fluid @xcite . as a consequence ( being the nonlinear term in the latter , part of the substantial derivative ) , @xmath12 has to be _ invariant _ under scale changes .",
    "the invariance of @xmath12 under scale changes leads to the remarkable relation @xmath17 ( a signature of the kpz universality class ) in _ any _ substrate dimensionality @xmath6 .    since the first and third terms in the l.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) were already present in the model by edwards and wilkinson ( ew ) , the innovation came from the tilt - dependent local growth velocity in the second term ( or rather , by its interplay with the third one ) . under additive uncorrelated local gaussian white noises ,",

    "@xmath19 is in turn the ratio between the interface s hlder ( or _ roughness _ )",

    ", @xmath20 turns out to be that of simple random walk ( namely @xmath23 ) in both models .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq:2 ] ) imposes that @xmath21 ( and thus @xmath19 ) be appreciably different ( at least after some crossover time , needed for the second term to take over the first ) .",
    "the initial success of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) was then due to the consistency of @xmath24 with kir experimental results .",
    "equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) is often attributed to the burgers equation s galilean invariance , which in turn translates into kpz equation s invariance under changes in tilt .",
    "this opinion has been repeatedly challenged and in fact , the numerically computed exponents obey eq .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) where both galilean invariance and the ( 1d  peculiar ) fluctuation  dissipation theorem are explicitly broken @xcite .    by about half its lifetime so far , the field was mature enough to approach not only the second moment of the fluctuations in @xmath25 but its full statistics .",
    "the innovation began within the field of dprm , and led to propose for @xmath26 the asymptotic behavior @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath27 with @xmath28 the stochastic variable @xmath29 obeys the tracy ",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) have arisen : whereas most of them were inspired by rmt @xcite , one was born right within the field of stochastic differential equations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the field is by now so mature that experiments can decide on the statistics @xcite . and",
    "pretty much the same occurs with the numerics : in a recent review article , the statistics of kpz itself has been found to agree with the results transposed from dprm @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to lighten up the abovementioned developments from the perspective of a recent variational formulation of the kpz equation @xcite . in the following section we derive general consequences from some properties of the nonequilibrium potential functional @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "next , we undertake a numerical study of the time dependence of @xmath31 $ ] and derive some consequences from the forced case .",

    "even though at time @xmath1 , @xmath35 depends _ only _ on the field @xmath2 , its evaluation requires _ knowing the detailed history _ that led from @xmath36 to @xmath2 . in other words , retrieving information on @xmath35 ( such as its landscape at certain time or the time dependence of its mean value ) requires averaging not simply over field configurations @xmath37 at time @xmath1 , but over ( statistically weighted ) _ trajectories _ of the field configuration .",
    "being the kpz equation a stochastic gradient flow , its nep @xmath35 ( which governs its _ deterministic _ component ) provides the _ landscape _ where the stochastic dynamics of @xmath2 takes place , and fulfils explicitly the lyapunov property @xmath38=-\\left[\\frac{\\delta\\phi[h]}{\\delta h(x , t)}\\right]^2\\leq0 $ ] .",

    "nonetheless a projection of it  the effective potential @xmath40 , obtained through the expansion of the functional in eq .",
    "( [ eq:12])will exhibit a simple cubic - like shape .",
    "as in the simple analogy before , this pdf can not be normalized except by considering an interval @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "assuming the referred cubic - like shape for the nep and at least in 1d ( where according to recent exact results the pdf is not a gaussian , but a tracy  widom distribution ) we may reason as follows :    * at the left of the small barrier , the nep increases with negative @xmath25 values , preventing the occurrence of large @xmath49 , and so the left branch of the distribution should decay at least like a gaussian ; * on the other hand , even before the small barrier has been overcome , large @xmath50 are slightly more probable than @xmath49 , and thus the right branch should decay much slowly .",
    "together with the results of @xcite , this observation indicates that the well known pdf @xcite @xmath51\\propto\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac\\nu{2d}\\int(\\nabla h)^2\\mathrm{d}x\\right\\},\\ ] ] makes sense only for a finite 1d system with periodic boundary conditions and for times larger than @xmath52 , the saturation one !      we can write the space discrete version of eq .",

    "moreover , since the potential value depends on the whole trajectory , it really implies a very long ( `` infinite '' ) memory .",
    "it seems natural to immediately relate this fact with the ageing phenomena found in relation with kpz @xcite .      to close this section we recall that the potential @xmath31 $ ]",

    "however , this activation - like behavior is _ not _ of the exponential ( kramers - like ) form and moreover , it is valid only for a limited range of @xmath4 .",
    "this assertion can be understood by looking at the form of the nep , @xmath97&&=\\int\\mathrm{d}x\\left[\\frac{\\nu}{2}(\\nabla h)^2-\\frac{\\lambda}{2 } \\int_0^h\\mathrm{d}\\psi(\\nabla\\psi)^2-f\\,h(x , t)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\approx\\int\\mathrm{d}x\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}-\\frac{\\lambda u}{6}\\right)(\\partial_x u)^2-f\\,u\\right].\\label{eq:15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath98 , the evolution towards negative values of @xmath25 proceeds mainly along the directions where @xmath99 .",

    "this aspect will be fully clarified in the next section .",
    "thus for @xmath101 , the time behaviors of @xmath102\\rangle$ ] and @xmath96 are _ correlated _ , even though the dispersion of the nep ( fig .",
