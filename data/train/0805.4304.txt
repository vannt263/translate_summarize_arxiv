    "it is shown that the radio emission at higher frequencies arises mostly from uhe particles impinging near the rim of the moon but at lower frequencies from a major part of the moon , indicating the advantage of making observations at lower frequencies using already existing or planned radio telescopes of large collecting areas in the frequency range of about 30 to 300 mhz .",

    "the receiver system provides output at two orthogonal polarizations from each of the 30 antennas with a maximum bandwidth of 16 mhz for each polarization , being sampled at 32 ns each .",
    "the @xmath13 of each antenna is nearly 950 @xmath1 in the frequency range of 130 to 630 mhz and only 600 @xmath1 at 1430 mhz .",

    "however , we may note that the gmrt provides the above area only when the voltage outputs of all the 30 antennas are added in phase resulting in antenna beam of @xmath9 2 arcsec at the highest frequency and @xmath9 15 arcsec at 150 mhz and therefore covering only a small part of the moon .",
    "however the receiver correlator allows incoherent addition of the outputs of the 30 antennas , covering the entire front surface of the moon and resulting in @xmath56 @xmath57 at the lower 4 frequency bands and @xmath58 at 1390 mhz .",
    "insetad if we measure coincidences of the power outputs of the 30 antennas , the effective area will also be 5203 @xmath1 at the lower frequency bands but would have the advantage of discrimination between the lunar cerenkov emission and any terrestrial radio frequency interference(rfi ) as the gmrt antennas are located in an array of @xmath9 25 km extent",
    ".    an alternative strategy will be more effective if we use the recently installed software correlator at the gmrt for cross multiplications of the voltage outputs of the 30 gmrt dishes with @xmath59 mhz .",
    "it allows 32 ns sampling of the voltage outputs of each of the 30 antennas . by combining these voltage outputs for the central 14 antennas of the gmrt with appropriate phase values",
    ", it would be possible to form 25 phased beams covering the moon , each beam having a resolution of about 6 arcmin at 140 mhz .",
    "the effective area for each of the 25 beams will be 14250 @xmath1 at the lower frequency bands and 9000 @xmath1 at @xmath9 1 ghz , providing a competitive radio telescope for searching for uhe neutrinos .",
    "contributions by the moon s temperature to the system temperature of the gmrt receiver is negligible at 140 mhz but is appreciable at higher frequencies . using the system parameters of the gmrt as given in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , we have estimated sensitivity of uhe cr and uhe neutrinos fluxes as given in figs [ crlimit100 ] , [ crblimit100 ] , [ nlimit100 ] , [ nblimit100 ] and [ fluxgmrt ] .",

    "the ort consists of a 530 m long and 30 m wide parabolic cylinder that is placed in the north south direction on a hill with the same slope as the latitude of the station  @xcite .",

    "an analogue system that was originally built for lunar occultation observations  @xcite provided 12 beams to cover the moon ; each beam is 6 arcmin in the north side direction and 126 arcmin ( @xmath9 2 deg . ) in the east west direction . recently a digital system has been installed by the raman research institute ( rri ) , bangalore and the radio astronomy centre of ncra / tifr , at ooty allowing formation of phased array beams with collecting area = 8000 @xmath1 and a bandwidth of 10 mhz with @xmath9 40 ns sampling  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to form 6 beams covering the moon and 7th beam far away for discrimination of any terrestrial rfi .",
    "the proposed upgrade of the 12 beam analogue system will provide a bandwidth of 15 mhz .",
    "the measured receiver temperature of the ort is 140 k + a contribution by moon of @xmath2 ( 31.5/126 ) x 230 k = 57 k. thus @xmath65 of ort for lunar observations at 327 mhz is about 200 k. as discussed in the next section , observations of the moon for 1000 hrs using the ort at 325 mhz will provide appreciably higher sensitivity than the past searches made by various workers and also compared to a search being made currently in netherlands using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) at 140 mhz . using the ort ,",
    "it may be possible to reach sensitivity to test the predictions of the waxmann - bachall model based on theoretical arguments .",
    "proposed observations , particularly with the ort will also provide arcsec resolution for galactic and extragalactic radio sources occulted by the moon , and may also search for any transient celestial sources in the antenna beam outside the disc of the moon .",
    "it would be quite valuable to make passive radio maps of the moon using the gmrt at decimetre and metre wavelengths .",
    "the suface temperature of the moon is about 130 k in its night time and @xmath9 330 k in its day time .",
    "since moon s surface consists of lossy dielectric material , the radio waves emitted by its thermal properties arise from few cm at microwaves to more than 100 m deep at wavelength of several m. therefore , the observed values of brightness temperature of the moon varies by tens of degrees at microwaves to less than a degree at radio wavelengths .",
    "the gmrt provides a resolution of about 2 arcsec at @xmath9 1420 mhz and @xmath9 15 arcsec at 150 mhz .",
    "polarization observations are also possible with the gmrt .",
    "therefore , maps of radio emission of the moon for its night and day with the gmrt will provide estimates of the dielectric constant and electric conductivity of the lunar regolith .",
    "the data will be complimentary to the radar measurements  @xcite .",
    "in this section we calculate model independent limits for detection of uhe cr and uhe neutrinos for gmrt and ort using the procedure given in panda _",

    "@xcite have considered dividing the wsrt antennas into 3 groups for the proposed search for neutrinos , whence a is likely to be @xmath66 they give a value of @xmath45 = 600 jy for wsrt and @xmath67 jy . the system temperature for the ort , @xmath65 = 200k , at 327 mhz including contribution by the moon and @xmath68 . hence @xmath69 and @xmath70 = 1687.5 jy , which are much lower than for the wsrt .",
    "the event rate that would be expected at the telescope can be related to an isotropic flux @xmath71 of uhe particles on the moon through @xmath72 where @xmath73 denote the type of primary particle and @xmath74 is an aperture function corresponding to the effective detector area .",
    "the aperture can be further decomposed into an angular aperture @xmath75 and a geometric area factor for the moon @xmath76 with @xmath77 km . to evaluate the aperture",
    ", we use the analytical methods described in   @xcite . for the case of strongly interacting cosmic rays which can mainly interact on the surface of the moon ,",
    "the angular aperture is given by @xmath78 \\times \\theta(\\cos\\beta ) \\mathrm{d}\\alpha\\mathrm{d}\\cos\\beta , \\label{angle}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the polar and azimuthal coordinates of the ray normal to the moon s surface in a system where the shower direction defines the @xmath81 axis .",
    "the full geometry and the different angles are described in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "when the uhe primary is instead a neutrino , it can produce showers deep below the surface of the moon and there will be considerable attenuation of the radio waves which travel distances longer than @xmath82 below the surface . for the neutrino induced showers , the aperture is defined in the same way as for the cr , but the angular aperture is now given   @xcite by @xmath83-{\\cal e}_{th}\\bigr\\ }   \\times \\exp[-l(z,\\beta)/\\lambda_{\\nu } ] \\times \\mathrm{d}\\alpha \\mathrm{d}\\cos\\beta , \\label{omega - nu}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the distance the neutrino travels inside the material to reach the interaction point at a distance @xmath81 below the surface . in performing this integration",
    "we allow @xmath81 to go below the known depth of the regolith . despite the attenuation",
    ", the aperture therefore picks up contributions coming from deep showers , especially for the lower frequencies .",
    "numerically we find for the worst case ( when @xmath85 mhz ) , that imposing a sharp cutoff at a depth of @xmath86  m would reduce the aperture by nearly an order of magnitude , similarly to what was discussed in   @xcite .    as for the cosmic rays ,",
    "the total aperture is obtained by substituting ( [ omega - nu ] ) into ( [ acr ] ) and integrating over the polar angle @xmath87 .    to estimate the sensitivity of gmrt and ort to cosmic ray and neutrino events we have evaluated the angular apertures by employing this technique and performing numerical integrations for the different parameters given in tables [ table1],[table2 ] , [ table3 ] . in the next section",
    "we will discuss these results further in the context of prospectiveflux limits .",
    "if no events are observed at gmrt and ort over a time @xmath88 then an upper limit can be derived on uhe cr and neutrino fluxes at the moon .",
    "the conventional model - independent limit  @xcite is given by @xmath89 where still @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "plots for wsrt and lofar for t=100 hours of the observation time are also shown . in figs",
    "[ crlimit100 ] and [ crblimit100 ] are given model independent limits on uhe cr flux at different frequencies of the gmrt for an incoherent array and 25 beams case respectively for 100 hours of observations .",
    "similarly for the uhe neutrinos , prospective limits on their flux for t=100 , 1000 and 8760 hours of observation with ort are given in fig .",

    "figs [ nlimit100 ] and [ nblimit100 ] give limits on the uhe neutrinos at different frequencies of the gmrt for an incoherent array and 25 beams case respectively for 100 hours of observations . for all our calculations we take @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the plots that that low frequency observations give more stringent limits on the flux at the expense of a higher threshold .",
    "this is due to the well - known increase in the aperture  @xcite from radiation spreading at lower frequencies .",
    "since many radio experiments exist for uhe neutrino detection , we have compiled a comparison in fig.[fluxgmrt ] .",
    "this figure contains , the predicted thresholds of the ort at 325 mhz for 1 year of observation time , of the gmrtb ( 25 beams case ) at 140 mhz for 100 hrs and 30 days of observation time and the already existing limits from rice  @xcite , glue  @xcite , forte  @xcite and anita - lite  @xcite .",
    "also we have indicated the prospective future limits that has been calculated for anita  @xcite , lofar  @xcite or lord  @xcite .",
    "james and protheroe  @xcite have recently calculated sensitivity of the next generation of lunar cerenkov observations for uhe cr and neutrinos .    in addition to search for uhe cr and neutrinos , simultaneous observations with the full array of the gmrt will provide radio maps of the moon as a function of the lunar phase , giving information about the average thermal and electrical conductivity of the moon s regolith up to depth of @xmath9 30 m to 100 m. therefore , for the two experiments to be carried out simultaneously , it may be possible to get 2@xmath96 50 hours of observations in two gmrt time allocation cycles .",
    "also , observations with the ort at the same time will allow discrimination against man made rfi transients .",
    "it will be prudent to use both the ort and the gmrt for searching for the uhe neutrinos .",
    "the new software correlator being installed at the gmrt will allow forming @xmath9 25 beams at 140 mhz to cover the moon at @xmath9 140 mhz providing 2 bands of 16 mhz and @xmath97 14250 @xmath3 one may also conveniently use the incoherent mode of the gmrt with @xmath97 5203 @xmath3 although ort with @xmath988000 @xmath1 operates only at 325 mhz , it is well suited to track the moon for hundreds of hours .",

    "@xcite of the raman research institute , in conjunction with the 12 beams of the analogue system ort and also it s upgrade , it should be possible to reach adequate sensitivity to test the waxman bahcall limit proposed on theoretical arguments on the uhe particle flux .    proposed observations , particularly with the ort will also provide arcsec resolutions for celestial radio sources occulted by the moon , and may also detect any transient celestial sources present in the antenna beam outside the disc of the moon .",
