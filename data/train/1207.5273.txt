    "in the last years , the analysis of coherent hadron - hadron collisions becomes an alternative way to study the theory of strong interactions - the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) - in the regime of high energies ( for reviews see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the basic idea in coherent hadron collisions is that the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons in the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - hadron production cross section .",
    "the main advantage of using colliding hadrons and nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities , that can be achieved at existing and future accelerators .",
    "consequently , studies of @xmath7 interactions at lhc provides valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "the photon - hadron interactions can be divided into exclusive and inclusive reactions . in the first case ,",
    "a certain particle is produced , while the target remains in the ground state ( or is only internally excited ) .",
    "on the other hand , in inclusive interactions the particle produced is accompanied by one or more particles from the breakup of the target .",
    "the typical examples of these processes are the exclusive vector meson production , described by the process @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , and the inclusive heavy quark production [ @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ] , respectively . the results of these studies demonstrate that their detection is feasible at the lhc ( for recent discussions see , e.g. refs .",
    "it motivates the analysis of the production of other final states in coherent hadron - hadron interactions .    in this paper",
    "we study , for the first time , the inclusive quarkonium + photon photoproduction in @xmath12 collisions at lhc energies . the total cross section for the process @xmath13",
    "( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents a rapidity gap in the final state , @xmath16 is the photon energy , @xmath17 is the equivalent photon flux , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the c.m.s energy of the hadron - hadron system .",
    "the photon spectrum of a relativistic proton is given by @xcite , @xmath20 \\left ( \\ln{\\omega } - \\frac{11}{6 } + \\frac{3}{\\omega }   - \\frac{3}{2 \\,\\omega^2 } + \\frac{1}{3 \\,\\omega^3 } \\right ) \\",
    ", , \\label{eq : photon_spectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the notation @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 \\approx ( \\omega/ \\gamma_l)^2 $ ] and @xmath23 is the lorentz boost of a single beam .",
    "distinctly from the exclusive vector meson photoproduction discussed in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , which is characterized by two rapidity gaps in the final state , in our case it is characterized by one rapidity gap associated to the photon emitted by one of the protons and the remnants of the other proton . the main input in our calculations is the @xmath3 cross section , which we estimate using the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism @xcite .",
    "recent results demonstrate that this formalism is able to describe quite well the rhic and hera data for the hadroproduction and photoproduction of charmonium in terms of an universal set of matrix elements and that the inclusion of the color octet processes is indispensable to describe the photoproduction data @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we present a brief review about the quarkonium+@xmath24 photoproduction in the nrqcd formalism . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our predictions for the rapidity distributions and total cross sections for @xmath6 and @xmath25 production at lhc energies .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] , we summarize our main conclusions .     photoproduction cross section considering three different sets of matrix elements ( see text ) . ]",
    "in the nrqcd formalism the cross section for the production of a heavy quarkonium state @xmath26 factorizes as @xmath27 + x ) \\langle { \\cal{o}}^h[n]\\rangle$ ] , where the coefficients @xmath28 + x)$ ] are perturbatively calculated short distance cross sections for the production of the heavy quark pair @xmath29 in an intermediate fock state @xmath30 , which does not have to be color neutral .",
    "the @xmath31\\rangle$ ] are nonperturbative long distance matrix elements , which describe the transition of the intermediate @xmath29 in the physical state @xmath26 via soft gluon radiation .",
    "currently , these elements have to be extracted in a global fit to quarkonium data as performed , for instance , in ref .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the underlying mechanics governing heavy quarkonium production is still subject of intense debate ( for a recent review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the specific case of the @xmath0 photoproduction",
    ", the total cross section can be expressed as follows @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 being the four momentum of the quarkonium , proton and photon , respectively . in the proton rest frame , @xmath37 can be interpreted as the fraction of the photon energy carried away by the quarkonium .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 is the magnitude of the quarkonium three - momentum normal to the beam axis . the partonic differential cross section @xmath39 is given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are , respectively , the charge and mass of heavy quark constituent of the quarkonium .",
    "the mandelstam variables can be expressed in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as follows :    @xmath43    moreover , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the bjorken variable @xmath47 can be expressed by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the photon - proton center - of - mass energy . in our calculations",
    "we consider the gluon distribution as given by the cteq6 parametrization @xcite , @xmath50 and assume @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev .",
    "in what follows we present our results for the @xmath53 photoproduction in coherent hadron - hadron collisions at lhc energies .",
    "one of the main uncertainties in our predictions is associated to the nrqcd matrix elements . for the @xmath54 case , we consider the more recent global fit performed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( denoted bk hereafter ) , and its uncertainties , which obtain that @xmath55 gev@xmath56 . for comparison , we also use the value previously considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( denoted mehen hereafter ) : @xmath57 gev@xmath56 .",
    "although this choice is outdated , we keep it in order to estimate the dependence of the matrix elements in our results for the @xmath6 production in coherent interactions . moreover",
    ", we also consider the value recently obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath58 gev@xmath56 ( denoted chao et al . hereafter ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the bk and chao et al .",
    "matrix elements are compatible within the errors . as show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the bk and mehen choices imply very distinct results for the @xmath6 photoproduction cross section , with the latter being an upper bound for the total cross section . as expected , our prediction using the central value for the chao et al .",
    "matrix element is very similar to the bk one .",
    "the cross section increases with the energy , which is directly associated to the @xmath47-behaviour of the gluon distribution .",
    "it is important to emphasize that while studies of photoproduction at hera were limited to photon - proton center of mass energies of about 200 gev , photon - hadron interactions at lhc can reach one order of magnitude higher on energy .",
    "for instance , if we consider @xmath12 collisions at lhc , the lorentz factor is @xmath59 , giving the maximum c.m.s . @xmath7",
    "energy @xmath60 gev .",
    "consequently , the analysis can also be useful to constrain the proton gluon distribution .",
    "( for related studies see ref .",
    "we postpone a more detailed study of this topic for a forthcoming publication .    for the @xmath2 case , we use two different sets of values for the matrix elements . the first one taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ( denoted bsv hereafter ) , which obtain @xmath61 gev@xmath56 from fits to cdf data for bottomonium production .",
    "the second one we taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ( denoted bfl hereafter ) which obtain @xmath62 gev@xmath56 .",
    "recently , the @xmath2 prompt production at the tevatron and lhc in nrqcd was studied in ref .",
    "unfornately , the fit of the tevatron data performed in @xcite only determine linear combinations of the matrix elements , which implies that the exact value of @xmath63 is unknown @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have computed for the first time the cross sections for photoproduction of quarkonium@xmath64 in coherent @xmath12 collisions at lhc energies using the nrqcd formalism and considering different sets of values for the matrix elements .",
    "such processes are interesting since the final state is characterized by a low multiplicity and one rapidity gap .",
    "moreover , the produced large @xmath65 quarkonia are relatively easy to detect through their leptonic decay modes and their transverse momenta are balanced by the associated high energy photon .",
    "our results demonstrate that the rapidity distributions and total cross sections are strongly dependent on the magnitude of the matrix elements .",
    "moreover , we predict sizeable for the @xmath6 cross section , which makes the experimental analyses of this process feasible at lhc .",
