    "open quantum systems are currently in the center of attention of physicists in different subfields .",
    "the main driving force in this direction is evidently the quest for the new progress of quantum informatics .",
    "another area with significant recent achievements related to openness of a quantum system is nuclear physics , where the understanding of structure and reactions of loosely bound nuclei far from stability requires the correct unified treatment of bound states and continuum .",
    "cold atoms in traps and optical lattices can give rise to new effects of coupling , entanglement and transfer of information . solid - state micro- and nano - devices , including josephson junctions and spintronics , are probably the most developed arrangements of this type .    from a general point of view , in all cases we have to deal with a mesoscopic system of interacting constituents that serves as a guide for the transmission of a quantum signal .",
    "the system can have intrinsic degrees of freedom which can be excited and deexcited by the signal .",
    "the coupling to the external world is realized through a certain amount of channels characterized by the asymptotic quantum numbers of emitted particles or quanta and the final state of the system .",
    "each channel has an energy threshold where it becomes open and connects to the environment . in the absence of decoherence through external noise or a heat bath ,",
    "the transmission at given energy is described by the unitary scattering matrix in the space of channels open at this energy . all these features",
    "are common for numerous loosely bound or marginally stable mesoscopic systems determining their main observable properties .",
    "a convenient mathematical formalism for description of such systems is given by the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian ; this method based on the feshbach projection formalism @xcite is formally exact but very flexible and can be adjusted to many specific situations ; see the recent review article @xcite that covers applications to the continuum shell model in nuclear physics and , in less detail , to the quantum signal transmission through simple periodic and disordered chains .",
    "to stress the breadth of possible problems solved in a similar approach we can mention recent applications to arrays of antennas @xcite , fullerenes @xcite and studies of light harvesting bacteria @xcite .",
    "one bright phenomenon emerging in the situation with a sufficiently strong continuum coupling in the case when the number of open channels is relatively small compared to the number of involved intrinsic states is the so - called _ super - radiance_. being an analog of super - radiance in quantum optics @xcite , this term stands for the formation in the system of a collective superposition of the intrinsic states coherently coupled to the same decay channel .",
    "the number of possible states of this type is equal to the number of open channels .",
    "the simplest transmission system fully studied with the aid of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian is an open periodic chain with hopping between adjacent cells @xcite .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , after appropriate identification of parameters , this system is physically equivalent to a realistic sequence of quantum barriers and to the system of parallel waveguides considered in ref .",
    "the transmission was studied at weak continuum coupling ( a system of narrow individual resonances ) and in the limit of strong coupling when the resonances overlap and the main role is played by the physics of super - radiance ( collectivization through continuum ) .",
    "the limit of overlapping resonances is usually described , in the tradition borrowed from nuclear physics , in terms of ericson fluctuations @xcite ; it was shown that this theory should be corrected in a number of aspects , including the correct account for the unitarity that is the main source of super - radiance .",
    "the behavior of an ideal periodic system was juxtaposed to the case of disorder , where the super - radiance still survives , and it is possible to establish the connection to the anderson model , degree of chaos inside the system and universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "the consideration was also extended to grids with two- and three - dimensional geometry ; an especially interesting case is presented by the _ star graph _",
    "@xcite where a number of open channels intersect at a common central point .",
    "at this point an analog of a bound state ( evanescent wave ) with a long lifetime exists that can serve for accumulation of quantum information .",
    "thanks to the development of nanotechnology , the preparation of low - dimensional assemblies of nanoparticles becomes a routine experimental task @xcite .",
    "this renews the attention to the study of quantum properties of relatively simple low - dimensional mesoscopic systems which reveal a rich physical behavior . in this context , the exactly solvable models as tight - binding one- or two - dimensional chains coupled to adatoms or impurities are of special interest @xcite .    in what follows we consider a similar system with a two - level atom of an impurity ( qubit ) inserted into an open periodic chain .",
    "the model is simple enough to allow for the exact solution ; at the same time the model turns out to be rich enough to demonstrate interesting physics of the signal transmission .",
    "an analytical consideration is supplemented by the detailed numerical study for the finite chains .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we consider a _ closed _ chain of @xmath0 identical cells with the nearest neighbor hopping interaction .",
    "two arms of the chain are connected through the central cell occupied by a two - level atom ( qubit ) .",
    "we find the energy spectrum of the system that consists of a normal band of delocalized bloch standing waves and two additional states outside the band corresponding to the excited and the ground states of the qubit .",
    "we study the evolution of the energy spectrum as a function of the chain - qubit coupling strength .",
    "3 describes the energy spectrum of the _ open _ system coupled to the continuum through its edge states .",
    "the former stationary states acquire decay widths that change as a function of the coupling constants .",
    "the decay widths of the qubit states are small compared to those of the bloch waves .",
    "the qubit states remain essentially localized at the qubit even when the coupling of the chain to the continuum becomes sufficiently strong to allow for the formation of super - radiant states .    in sec .",
    "4 we study the transmission through the chain as a function of the coupling parameters . in both limits of the edge continuum coupling being weak and strong",
    "compared to the coupling between the qubit levels , the resonances are well isolated all having narrow decay widths and perfect transmission at resonance energies . when both couplings are of comparable strength , the resonances are overlapped and the transmission is below the perfect level .",
    "the results are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "we consider a linear chain of @xmath0 identical cells numbered as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while the central cell , @xmath3 , is occupied by a qubit , a two - level atom with states @xmath4 and @xmath5 , excitation energy @xmath6 , and matrix element @xmath7 of the qubit excitation .",
    "the energy @xmath8 is the level position in all cells ; for simplicity we put the lower level of the isolated qubit at the same position . introducing the hopping ( tunneling ) matrix element @xmath9 between the neighboring cells , we come to the hamiltonian of the closed chain : @xmath10 @xmath11 where all matrix elements can be considered as real .    before introducing the coupling to the outside world",

    "<S> a system of a two - level atom of an impurity ( qubit ) inserted into a periodic chain coupled to the continuum is studied with the use of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> exact solutions are derived for the quasistationary eigenstates , their complex energies , and transport properties . due to the presence of the qubit , </S>",
    "<S> two long - lived states corresponding to the ground and excited states of the qubit emerge outside the bloch energy band . </S>",
    "<S> these states remain essentially localized at the qubit even in the limit of sufficiently strong coupling between the chain and the environment when the super - radiant states are formed . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission through the chain is studied as a function of the continuum coupling strength and the chain - qubit coupling ; the perfect resonance transmission takes place through isolated resonances at weak and strong continuum coupling , while the transmission is lowered in the intermediate regime . </S>"
