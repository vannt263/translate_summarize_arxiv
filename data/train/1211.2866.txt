    "the study of the formation of the milky way is fundamental to the understanding of our galactic environment as well as that of galaxies in general .",
    "the past competing ideas of halo formation through monolithic collapse ( eggen et al .  1962 ) , and through the accretion of protogalactic fragments ( searle & zinn 1978 ) , have largely been replaced by a combination of the two scenarios within the theory of hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. , freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "the study of galactic structure has continued to flourish in recent years with the discoveries of numerous tidal streams and dwarf galaxies within the galactic halo ( e.g. , majewski et al .",
    "2003 ; belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ; newberg et al .",
    "the most well - studied of these structures is the accretion of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sgr , ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) . to date",
    "the sgr stream has been traced on large scales using blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars ( newberg et al .",
    "2003 ; belokurov et al .",
    "2006 ) and m - giants ( majewski et al . 2003 ) with portions of the stream being studied using rr lyrae ( rrl , vivas & zinn 2006 ; miceli et al .",
    "2008 ; sesar et al .",
    "in addition to the sgr stream , evidence has come for a virgo stellar stream ( vss ; vivas & zinn 2006 ; vivas et al .",
    "2008 ) using rrls and a virgo overdensity ( vod , newberg et al .",
    "2002 ) from f - type main - sequence stars ( newberg et al 2007 ) .",
    "an overdensity in pisces was reported by sesar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and confirmed by kollmeier et al .",
    "a monoceros stream has also been discovered ( newberg et al .",
    "2002 ; majewski et al 2003 ) that may be due to the disruption of the putative canis major dwarf ( casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "although the existence of this structure remains uncertain ( momany et al .",
    "2004 , mateu et al .",
    "2009 ) in addition , a cetus stream has been discovered in the south ( newberg et al .",
    "2009 ; koposov et al .",
    "2012 ) and belokurov et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also note the presence of an overdensity of bhb stars dubbed the hercules - aquila cloud .",
    "although the number of streams and structures found in the outer galactic halo ( galactocentric distances @xmath9 kpc ) has significantly increased in the past ten years , numbers fall far short of the hundreds predicted by @xmath10cdm models of hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "this `` missing satellite '' problem ( e.g. bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) continues to be important to our understanding of galaxy formation and requires us to probe the galactic halo to distances well beyond @xmath7 kpc .",
    "rr lyrae are fundamental distance probes that can be used to trace the history of galaxy formation ( e.g. , catelan 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "to date a few tens of thousands of rrl are known in dense regions near the galactic bulge , where the sgr dwarf galaxy is located .",
    "similar numbers of rrl are known also in the magellanic clouds , again thanks to microlensing surveys towards dense stellar fields ( soszyski et al .",
    "2009 , pietrukowicz et al . 2012 ) .",
    "however , the galactic halo itself has only been probed with confirmed rrl over a few thousand square degrees to heliocentric distances of @xmath11 to 100 kpc ( eg . , vivas et al .",
    "2004 ; keller et al .  2008 ; miceli et al .",
    "2008 ; watkins et al .  2009 ; sesar et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this paper",
    "we outline our search , discovery and calibration of the rrl to @xmath0 50 kpc .",
    "we then undertake a preliminary analysis of the structures uncovered .",
    "the catalina sky survey began in 2004 and uses three telescopes to cover the sky between declination @xmath12 and + 65 degrees in order to discover near - earth objects ( neos ) and potential hazardous asteroids ( phas ) .",
    "each of the survey telescopes are run as separate sub - surveys .",
    "these consist of the catalina schmidt survey ( css ) and the mount lemmon survey ( mls ) in tucson arizona , and the siding spring survey ( sss ) in siding spring australia . in general",
    "each telescope avoids the galactic plane region by between 10 and 15 degrees due to reduced source recovery in crowded stellar regions .",
    "all images are taken unfiltered to maximize throughput .",
    "photometry of all images is carried out using the aperture photometry program sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "in addition to asteroids , all the catalina data is analyzed for transient sources by the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , drake et al .",
    "2009 ; djorgovski et al 2011 ) .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the data taken by the catalina survey schmidt 0.7 m telescope ( css ) between april 2005 and june 2011 .",
    "these data cover 20,155 square degrees in the region @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for this css telescope",
    "each image from the @xmath15 catalina ccd camera covers 8 sq .",
    "degrees on the sky .",
    "all these archival observations analyzed in this work were taken during spans of 21 nights per lunation in sets of four images separated by 10 minutes .",
    "the exposure times are typically 30 seconds and reach objects to @xmath16 mag , depending on seeing and sky brightness .",
    "the distribution of observations in the css fields is given in figure [ nfno ] .",
    "in order to use rrl as probes for distances it is necessary to accurately calibrate the observed magnitudes to a standard system .",
    "all observations are transformed to johnson @xmath17 based on 50 - 100 stars selected as g - type stars using 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) colours . for bright stars ,",
    "this photometry provides repeated photometry accurate to @xmath18 ( larson et al .",
    ". however , as the photometry is unfiltered there are significant variations with object colour .",
    "the first step to determining accurate distance is calibration of the colour terms required and thus place the photometry on a standard system .",
    "the landolt ( 2007 ) ubvri standard star catalog provides 109 stars centered near declination @xmath19 in the magnitude range @xmath20 and in the color index range @xmath21 , while landolt ( 2009 ) provides a catalog of 202 standard stars along the celestial equator in the magnitude range @xmath22 , and the color index range @xmath23 , along with 393 standard stars from previous standard star catalogs .    for photometric calibration",
    "we combine observations taken with all three catalina sky survey telescopes since no difference was found between these systems .",
    "this is not surprising since each telescope specifically uses the same type @xmath15 ccd camera and observations with all three telescopes are calibrated using the same software pipeline . in total",
    "there are 445 catalina lightcurves matching landolt standards . on average",
    "each standard is measured 134 times . to reduce sources of error we first determined the variability index of each lightcurve .",
    "we remove a handful of stars that appeared to exhibit significant variability .",
    "as noted by landolt ( 2009 ) this catalog includes a small number of known variable stars .    in order to compare css @xmath17 magnitudes to landolt values we first determined median magnitudes for each lightcurve and calculated the difference from the standard value . in figure",
    "[ landolt ] , we plot the difference between landolt standards and transformed median css magnitudes",
    ". the high degree of scatter is due to the clear difference between the transformed unfiltered observations and filtered observations .",
    "the landolt dataset contains values for u , b , v , r and i filters . to better calibrate the photometry we fit the differences with the various possible colour terms .",
    "the colour transformations were clearly nonlinear .",
    "we find the follow transformations :    @xmath24    in figure [ landolt ] , we also plot the difference in magnitudes after applying this calibration . the dispersion in the fits to these transformations are 0.059 , 0.056 and 0.063 magnitudes , respectively for @xmath25 .",
    "the average b - v colour of rrl is about 0.3 mag with stars varying between about 0.1 and 0.5 as they pulsate ( nemec 2004 ) . for most of our sample",
    "we have no colour information so we adopt the average colour . from equation ( 1 ) , this leads to a correction of 0.028 magnitudes . from the transformations",
    "the range of possible colours gives rise to a maximum uncertainty of @xmath26 mags in @xmath17 . combining this with the photometric uncertainty",
    ", we expect a dispersion of @xmath27 mags in our rrl photometry .",
    "however , based on random phase sdss photometry , we will show that the rrl in our sample are strongly concentrated in a colour index range of 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "further tests of the importance of rrl colour variations in css data were carried out by torrealba et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and found to be unimportant .    to determine the photometric accuracy of the calibration at fainter magnitudes than landolt standards we selected the sample of 1170 bhb stars of sirko et al .",
    "these stars have similar ages , masses and @xmath28 colours to rrl stars .",
    "however , they have significantly different @xmath29 colours ( centered near -0.2 , compared to + 0.2 for the rrl ) .",
    "we matched the bhb source locations with css objects and removed 93 sources that matched candidate or known variable stars . as we want to determine robust estimates , we also removed objects with fewer than 20 css observations .",
    "the average number of measurements for the remaining 1026 bhb stars was 223 .",
    "we transformed the sdss dr8 photometry for the source to @xmath17 using the lupton ( 2005 ) transformation equations .",
    "for each source we determined median css v - magnitudes using equation [ tran ] and @xmath30 colours from sdss data . in figure",
    "[ bhb ] , we plot the difference between @xmath17 magnitudes derived from sdss and css and by binning the difference in one magnitude bins we also show how the scatter increases with decreasing source brightness .    of the 1026 bhb stars ,",
    "14 had offsets @xmath31 magnitudes .",
    "nine of these objects were found to be blended in the css photometry ( but not in sdss photometry ) .",
    "for the remaining objects we find an average difference of @xmath32 magnitudes and @xmath33 . as expected , the level of variation increases with decreasing brightness .",
    "considering that these stars are much fainter than the landolt standards the level of agreement is very good .",
    "the catalina sky survey data release 1 ( csdr1 ) covers 198 million discrete sources ranging in @xmath17 from 12 to 20 with an average of 250 observations per location . in order to discover the rrl among these sources we first calculate the welch - stetson variability index @xmath34 ( welch & stetson 1993 ) for every source . based on initial investigation we selected sources with @xmath35 as possible variables . for sources brighter",
    "than @xmath36 we set a higher variability threshold due to saturation effects .",
    "we also only selected lightcurves with more than 40 points .",
    "this process returned 8.7 million potential variable sources , or 4.4% of the sources .",
    "every candidate variable source was then checked for periodicity using the lomb - scargle ( ls , lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) periodogram analysis .",
    "this method was chosen since it was found to take approximately a second per lightcurve , compared to between 10 seconds and a few minutes for other techniques .",
    "periodic sources were selected based on ls peak significance statistic @xmath37 .",
    "this value represents the probability that the observed signal was observed purely due to chance fluctuations .",
    "however , we note that care must be taken when interpreting these values ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1998 ) . objects with very small values , @xmath38 , were chosen as good candidate periodic variables after the inspection of a few hundred sources phased to their best ls periods . based on the css lightcurves of known periodic variables , graham et al .",
    "( 2012 , in prep . ) found that this technique gives the correct periods for @xmath39 83% of known rrab with this sampling .",
    "an additional 13% of the rrl were detected as significantly periodic , yet the period did not match the known period .",
    "375,000 of the variable sources were found to exhibit periodicity at our significance level .",
    "however , a very large fraction of the periods were found to be spurious detections near 0.5 and 1 days .",
    "these periods are purely due to the observing cadence of css . upon close examination of the period distribution we removed all candidates with periods in the ranges @xmath40 or @xmath41 days .",
    "additional period aliases were found within individual fields . in these cases systematics",
    "were found to lead to the detection of many sources with very similar periods .",
    "we also removed periodic variable candidates where three or more sources within a given field had the same periods to @xmath42 0.2% .",
    "these cuts are expected to remove a very small fraction of the rrl with periods within these ranges .    to obtain a clean sample of rrl appropriate for distance determinations we decided to use only type - ab rrl ( rrab ) , since c - type ( rrc ) and d - type ( rrd )",
    "lightcurves are often very similar to w  uma type eclipsing binary lightcurves that occur in the same period region .",
    "for example , some past surveys have misidentified w  uma sources as rrc s ( kinman & brown 2010 ) .",
    "w  uma stars are more common than rrc variables , so even though most can be distinguished in well - sampled data , including rrc s is likely to lead to some contamination .    among the periodic sources we initially selected objects with periods between 0.36 and 1.4 days to conservatively include all rrab found at their true period , as well as many of those found at aliases of their period in the ls analysis .",
    "a total of 23346 objects were found in this period range . from the phased lightcurves",
    "a large number of these sources were clearly eclipsing binaries of all types , as well as rrc s found at aliases of their true periods .    to recover the 13% of sources that we expect to be detected at an incorrect period , and to determine more accurate periods among the periodic candidates , we determine the ten best periods for each source using the analysis of variance program ( aov ) ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 ) .",
    "the aov program was run in two stages which each provided five period .",
    "firstly the software was run in the normal _ aov - mode _ and then with the multi - harmonic method ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1996 ) .",
    "we compare these periods to the five best values found using the ls technique , giving us a total of 15 test periods . as there were many cases where the most significant period found by each method did not match that given by others , further analysis was undertaken .    to select the correct period for each object we follow the adaptive fourier decomposition ( afd ) method ( torrealba et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) . here",
    "the phased lightcurves were fit with an increasing series of fourier harmonics using a weighted least - squares technique .",
    "the order of the harmonic fit is chosen by determining whether the improvement in the observed reduced @xmath43 with additional of higher - order terms , is statistically significant based on the statistical f - test .",
    "this is evaluated by determining the likelihood of observing the improvement in reduced @xmath43 given the number of parameters and avoids over fitting the data with a single high - order series .",
    "in addition , since type rrab require more fourier terms to fit than than most eclipsing binaries and rrc , the fit order also provides additional discrimination between variable star types .",
    "we produced phase folded lightcurves using the 15 most significant periods from aov and ls .",
    "these were fit to select the best period based on their reduced @xmath43 values .",
    "in addition , to minimize the influence of bad data , each object is refit successively after removing outliers @xmath44 from the original fits . for rrab selection",
    "we remove sources where the best fit to the phased light curves is sinusoidal .",
    "this is done by only selecting objects where the best fourier fit is order three and above . objects with large reduced @xmath43 values at all periods were removed from the candidate list .    to further separate the rrab from w  uma variables we select",
    "only objects where the best fit period among the 15 candidates is between 0.43 and 0.95 days . for",
    "the remaining set we apply the m - test ( kinemuchi et al .",
    "this test statistic measures the fraction of time that an object spends below the mean magnitude .",
    "lightcurves with @xmath45 are selected as rrab since these sources spend most of the time above their average magnitude . in figure",
    "[ mtest ] , we show the best fit periods of all the sources and their m - test values .",
    "the dashed - lines show the region where rrab sources are selected .",
    "lightcurves with @xmath46 are sinusoidal w  uma and rrc variables .",
    "the eclipsing binaries are mainly concentrated at short periods near 0.2 days since these sources are very often found at half their true period .",
    "the rrc s are seen near 0.4 days but , as already explained , they are likely contaminated by some eclipsing binaries .",
    "the cutoff seen near 0.35 days and the slight gap near 0.5 days are due to the initial period selection limits .",
    "many objects are seen near 1 day due to the daily sampling - rate alias . of the initial selection ,",
    "12471 are selected as rrab stars .    in figure [ peramp ] , we plot the period - amplitude distribution of css rrab s . in the right panel of this figure",
    "we also present a hess ( relative density ) diagram for this same data .",
    "this figure shows that almost all of the rrab s lie near the oosterholf type - i ( ooi ) period - amplitude sequence .",
    "however , the amplitudes are slightly smaller than predicted since we have assumed average @xmath30 colour , whereas rrab s vary in colour with phase ( hardie 1955 ) . from equation ( 1 )",
    ", we find that a @xmath30 colour variation , between @xmath47 at maximum and @xmath48 at minimum , would lead to a 0.08 mag increase in the @xmath17 amplitude .",
    "by comparison with the rrab @xmath17 amplitudes of zorotovic et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find that the css rrab amplitudes uniformly underestimated by 0.15 mags and correct for this factor .",
    "a sequence of rrab s are seen at longer periods due primarily to lower - metalicity oosterholf type - ii ( ooii ) rrab s ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "however , the fraction of of oosterholf - ii stars is far smaller than observed for a sample of 1455 rrab nearby ( @xmath49 ) observed by szczygiel et al .",
    "the figure exhibits the presence of a gap in the distribution near 0.5 days due our period selection where we removed periods near sampling aliases .",
    "based on the number of rrab s with slightly shorter and slightly longer periods , we estimate the number of stars in this range to be around 160 stars , or @xmath50 of the total .    using the ooi period - amplitude relation defined by zorotovic et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we determine period - shifts for each rrab as shown in figure  [ perampm ] .",
    "the result is remarkably similar to the one shown in figure  20 of miceli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , thus being consistent with ooi and ooii components being present in our data as well .",
    "the fit with two gaussian components that is shown in the figure possesses a correlation coefficient @xmath51 and a standard error of 25.4 .",
    "we also fitted a skew - normal distribution to the data , based on equation  ( 3 ) of azzalini ( 1985 ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ perampm ] .",
    "this fit is noticeably worse than the two - gaussian fit , with @xmath52 and a standard error of the estimate of 43.3 .",
    "this confirms that , as in the case of miceli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , our distribution is also comprised of two separate components , which are naturally interpreted as ooi and ooii .",
    "however , the ooii component is clearly smaller in our case ; the two - gaussian fit implies that around 76% of our stars belong to the ooi , and 24% to the ooii population .",
    "there is , in addition , a clear excess of stars towards negative period shifts , which can be plausibly ascribed to the presence of the blazhko effect as well as rrab s that are blended with other sources .",
    "we examined the phased lightcurves of all the objects outside the region bounded by the dashed - lines in figure [ peramp ] .",
    "of the 439 rrab candidates in these regions , 140 were discovered not to be rrab and removed .",
    "most of the objects removed were variable stars near the css saturation limit , @xmath53 .",
    "many of the objects with unexpected amplitudes for an rrab were found to be blended sources . for close blends the additional flux tends to reduce the observed amplitude . for sources with slightly larger source separations the amplitude can actually increase slightly . in such cases",
    "the flux from the two separate sources are detected individually at minimum .",
    "as the rrab s flux increases , the nearby source become merged with the rrab flux .",
    "the average number of photometric measurements for the rrab candidates is 219 , with the poorest sampled having 60 and the best sampled having 416 measurements . in table 1 , for each source we present the locations , average @xmath17 magnitudes , periods , amplitudes , number of photometry measurements , distances and extinction . in figures [ aiteq ] & [ aiteqlb ] we present the locations of the rrab discovered in css survey fields .    in figure",
    "[ rrlc ] , we plot representative examples of rrab lightcurves spanning the range of discoveries from @xmath54 to 19.5 .",
    "each lightcurve has been folded with the period we discovered .",
    "the figure shows that the brightest rrab , near mag 12.5 , show significant saturation effects .",
    "this will affect the fits for these sources .",
    "however , there are only 62 rrab in our sample brighter than @xmath54 .",
    "a small fraction of the points shown in other lightcurves are clearly outliers caused by image artifacts and poor seeing . as outlined above these points",
    "are removed during the period finding and fourier fitting process .    of the remaining objects , 100 sources are rrab s observed in the overlap regions between fields .",
    "these sources provide a useful test of the photometric calibration between css fields and the period determinations . in figure",
    "[ diff ] , we plot the difference between the average fit magnitudes and periods of the rrab s overlapping between fields .",
    "this suggests that uncertainties in the photometric calibration between fields are generally @xmath55  mag in agreement with the comparison with landolt stars .",
    "we note that since overlapping objects are located on the edges of the fields , where the photometry is poorest , on average the photometry should be slightly better .",
    "in addition , we can see that the period determinations are in excellent agreement even though the total number of observations , and observation dates , vary between adjacent fields . for an rrab with a 0.6 day period",
    ", a 0.004% uncertainty corresponds to an uncertainty of only 2 seconds .",
    "of the 100 objects , none differed by more than @xmath56 in period , or more than 0.12 mag in @xmath17 .",
    "to compare the css rrab parameters with those of known rrab s , we downloaded all the objects marked as variable sources in the simbad database .",
    "this consisted of 41765 objects .",
    "we also downloaded the international variable star index ( vsx , jan 2011 edition ; watson et al .",

    "simbad and vsx data significantly overlap , yet both contain some unique sources . in the bulk of cases",
    "where the two sets match , the vsx dataset is superior since it provides the periods for the rrl .",
    "we matched the rrab with the vsx and simbad datasets and found 2136 matches to known simbad variable sources and 2753 matches to vsx sources . in order to account for significant astrometric uncertainties in some of the older sources we used a large 10 arcsecond matching radius .",
    "from the combined datasets we find matches to 2842 known sources .",
    "this is a small fraction of the total number of known rrl .",
    "most have been found by microlensing surveys which have almost exclusively covered the galactic bulge and the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , soszyski et al . 2009 , pietrukowicz et al .",

    "overall we find @xmath67 of the genuine rrab in the vsx dataset were missed in our selection because of their brightness ( 2% ) , blending ( 1% ) , poor or noisy lightcurve sampling ( 8% ) , period variations ( 1% ) , or inaccurate ls periods ( 17% ) .      in order to better understand the detection completeness of our rrab sample we decided to simulate the detection of css rrab s from lightcurves through to variability selection and processing with afd software .",
    "this estimation process requires understanding the different sampling effects and variation in uncertainties between fields , as well as reproduction of realistic rrab lightcurves and underlying period distribution .",
    "the css data set analysed here contains 2454 separate fields . as shown in figure [ nfno ] , there is significant range in the number of observations per field .",
    "the distribution of observation density on the sky is given on the catalina data release website .",
    "in our simulations we selected @xmath68 ( 134 ) of the fields .",
    "the least sampled among these test fields had 35 observations while most sampled had 256 . for each of the 134 test fields we measured the average magnitude and scatter in brightness for each source .",
    "we also determined the detection completeness as a function of magnitude for each image based on comparison with deeper coadded images .",
    "as systematic uncertainties are likely to vary between fields , we used the average source magnitudes and uncertainties to determine the scatter as a function of magnitude for each field . since @xmath68 of the photometry was found to contain outliers we model the error distribution using two separate gaussians with varying standard deviations .",
    "one reflects the @xmath69 of good data and the the remaining points model outliers .    to simulate realistic lightcurves we selected 1010 high signal - to - noise css rrab s with average magnitudes @xmath70 , fourier - fit reduced @xmath71 , and more than 100 observations .",
    "the fits to these sources serve as templates .",
    "as the detection completeness depends on rrl period it is necessary to select an underlying period distribution .",
    "cseresnjes ( 2001 ) provides a sample of 3700 rrls from a mixture of sagittarius dwarf and milky way sources .",
    "we used this distribution to select periods for our test sources .",
    "the number of test sources in each field was chosen to exponentially increase with decreasing brightness so that many faint sources would properly sample the detection sensitivity for faint sources .",
    "once a period is selected we find the closest match among the 1010 templates and combine this with the uncertainties observed for each field and brightness .",
    "we generated @xmath72 artificial rrab lightcurves for sources with magnitudes from @xmath54 to 20.5 .",
    "the artificial rrab lightcurves were all run through the same variability and period selection process as the real data .",
    "of the 100,000 simulated objects , 15,271 were detected as variable sources and thus had their ls periods determined .",
    "of these sources 11,543 were found to have periods within the range selected for rrab s and among these 10,483 ( 90% ) were ultimately selected as rrab via the afd software .    in figure",
    "[ compl ] , we show the distribution of recovered artificial rrab s .",
    "the error bars show poisson uncertainties based on the number of detected sources .",
    "the figure suggests that real rrab s will be missed at all brightness levels .",
    "this result is in agreement with our comparison to vsx data .",
    "also , few of the brightest sources are recovered because saturation effects cause large uncertainties .",
    "this figure combines the poorly sampled fields with well sampled fields . on average",
    "the artificial lightcurves have fewer observations than the observed distribution and thus underestimate the average number of recovered sources .",
    "however , the plot clearly shows that many of the faint objects that are selected as variable sources are ultimately not recovered as rrab s .",
    "this result suggests that implying additional period finding searches on the millions of candidate variables may well lead to additional rrab discoveries .",
    "in particular , as the largest difference in recovery is at faint magnitudes many distant rrab s may be recovered .",
    "however , period recovery at such low signal - to - noise may be difficult . to investigate the dependence of completeness on the number of observations in a field , we combined the 134 fields into four groups .",
    "fields observed less than 100 times , fields observed between 100 and 130 times , fields observed 130 to 180 times and fields observed more than 180 times .",
    "the completeness results for these groups are also shown in figure [ compl ] .",
    "the figure clearly demonstrates the significant affect that increasing numbers of observations have .",
    "much of the reason for this difference is mainly is the decrease in photometric sensitivity with magnitude . for example , a 19th magnitude source is detected in less than half of the observations of a field .",
    "thus the number of points within the artificial lightcurves of faint sources is far fewer than the total number of observations .",
    "the average number observations per field best matches the top curve we present , suggesting that @xmath73 of the bright rrab s are recovered ( in good agreement with the analysis above ) .",
    "we note that our completeness for small numbers of observations is in marked contrast to the results miceli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) based on between 28 and 50 epochs of loneos data . however , these authors detected rrls using a template fitting method .",
    "this is likely to be much more sensitive with smaller numbers of observations and may also improve the recovery of faint rrab s .",

    "the bulk of the sources are strongly clustered near @xmath79 and @xmath80 with a scatter of @xmath81 magnitudes .",

    "almost all of the rrab s lie within the sdss colour region selected by ivezic et al .",
    "we inspected a number of the outliers and it was clear that a small number of the rrab s were blended with other stars , or galaxies , when compared to higher - resolution sdss images .",
    "the flux from the additional source distorts the colour of the object , increases the brightness , and typically reduces the observed amplitude of the variability .    to compare the sdss magnitudes to those derived from our calibration with landolt standards",

    "this dispersion is much larger than for the bhb sample .",
    "like the bhb sample , the dispersion in the phase - corrected and transformed sdss magnitudes includes errors in the sdss photometry and uncertainties in the transformation from sdss @xmath84 and @xmath85 to @xmath17 magnitudes . however , additional scatter beyond the bhb sample is due to the uncertainties in the rrl periods ( of order 0.002% ) and the resulting phase corrections as many of the sdss observations of these objects were made around 2001 , while css observations were generally taken from 2005 .",
    "for example , a 0.5-day period rrab undergoes @xmath87 cycles in four years . over this period a 0.002% error in the period compounds to a phase offset of 0.06 ( @xmath88 mins ) . in rrab lightcurves an error of @xmath81 in the phase before the peak can correspond to a 1 magnitude variation in brightness . taking this into account",
    ", the average magnitudes derived from the css lightcurves should have accuracy similar to the bhb sample , with some additional small uncertainty of up to 0.07 magnitudes due to the assumption of an average rrl colour ( see  3 ) .    to further investigate the source of differences in brightness we selected the 457 outlier rrab s with offsets @xmath89 mag ( @xmath44 ) . from visual inspection it was clear that approximately 50 exhibited period variations .",

    "the sdss measurements are calibrated based on the known metallicities of globular clusters that were specifically covered for calibration purposes .",
    "the resulting values from the various methods are combined to provide an overall best value ( fehadop ) along with an uncertainty .",

    "the final set consists of 905 spectra ( less than half of the original set ) .    to accurately correct for velocity variation one must also consider how the radial velocities were measured .",

    "we then find sources with galactocentric distances @xmath131 and coordinates within range of sagittarius stream based on the majewski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) sgr stream coordinates ( @xmath132 ) . as a comparison , we select lm10 data points in this same region . in figure",
    "[ velsgr ] , we compare the sdss data with this lm10 model .",
    "the bulk of sources are a very good match to the model .",
    "however , compared to the model , the rrab s in the region @xmath133 appear to show a velocity trend with much large velocities than the lm10 .",
    "the region @xmath134 is not plotted since it is very poorly covered by sdss data .    to compare the distant rrab distribution with the lm10 model we determine galactocentric distances for all the objects .",
    "we next separate the rrab s into four groups , namely a sample at distances @xmath135 kpc and three more distant halo rrab samples with ranges 33.5 to 38 kpc , 38 to 45 kpc , and 45 to 65 kpc .",
    "these distance ranges were chosen to broadly separate the 1468 rrab s at distances @xmath136 kpc into three similar groups of @xmath137 rrl each . in figure [ complaw ] , we plot the distribution of the halo rrab s among the sample along with the lm10 model .",
    "the sgr stream is clearly visible .",
    "however , many rrab s are seen in the region @xmath138 beyond 45 kpc and are not explained by the lm10 model .",
    "additionally , many distant rrl are found in locations not expected from the sgr model .",
    "there is no obvious division of the sgr rrab s into two streams as discovered by belokurov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and koposov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .    to further investigate the sgr stream , based on figure [ eclip ]",
    ", we select the clear sgr rrab with @xmath139 in the region of @xmath140 .",
    "we determined the density distribution and plot this in figure [ distsgr ] .",
    "after binning the data in two degree bins we find that the main density distribution is well described by a single gaussian centered at @xmath141 , with @xmath142 , plus a background of @xmath143 rrab s . here",
    "the number of halo rrab s is a factor of @xmath144 smaller than main - sequence turn off ( msto ) stars analyzed by koposov et al .",
    "thus , although there is no obvious evidence for a second peak near @xmath145 , we can conclude that the rrab are distributed across the two streams ( seen in sdss msto stars and 2mass m - giants ) , rather than limited to one .    in figure [ distra ]",
    ", we plot the distribution of heliocentric distances for the rrab s .",
    "the sgr streams are clearly seen rising up to heliocentric distances of @xmath146 kpc near @xmath147 and 30kpc near @xmath148 .",
    "we also include the m - giant selected by lm10 as leading and trailing sgr stream sources .",
    "the rrab s appear to have distances consistent with the m - giants , although with significantly less scatter .",
    "we note that newberg et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found a 13% difference in the distance to the sgr stream when comparing a - coloured stars , such as rr lyrae and bhb stars , to m - giants , which is not confirmed in this study .    in figure [ distra ]",
    ", we also compare the results with the sgr stream n - body model of lm10 . for an improved comparison",
    "we apply extinction to each of the lm10 data points and remove sources that would have apparent magnitudes corresponding to rrab s beyond our detection limit ( @xmath149 kpc ) .",
    "we also remove points within @xmath150 of the galactic plane , since this region is not covered by css data .",
    "although there is some overall agreement , at distances less than 20 kpc the presence or galactic halo rrl is a significant factor , making comparison with the predicted nearby streams difficult .",
    "this is particularly the case near the galactic center . we over - plot two lines that clearly demonstrate the difference in distances between the lm10 n - body model and the observational data .",
    "the model predicts stars @xmath151 kpc further than observed .",
    "this is expected since lm10 found that their model predicted fainter @xmath152 magnitudes for m - giants than observed .",
    "other differences include the sagittarius leading arm near @xmath153 kpc @xmath154 .",
    "although there appear to be stars near this location , the density is much lower than predict by the lm10 model .",
    "the distances of rrab in sgr leading arm are found to vary by up to @xmath155 ( corresponding to 0.37 mags ) .",
    "as @xmath156 uncertainties in the rrab magnitudes are @xmath157 mags , the intrinsic depth of the leading sgr stream is expected to be significantly less than 10 kpc .",
    "furthermore , there is only a weak sign for a sgr leading stream to the dense region at @xmath158 , @xmath153 kpc .",
    "there is some evidence for rrab at a greater distance .",
    "however , we note that in this region of the sagittarius stream is not very well constrained by our observations .",
    "as expected we do observe the trailing stream in the region @xmath159 . without any doubt",
    "this stream does not continue on the sgr stream in the region @xmath160 .",
    "we have presented the initial results of a survey of public css data ( csdr1 ) for rrab s and discovered @xmath161 , of which @xmath162 are newly discovered .",
    "the full sample of rrab s range in brightness @xmath163 and thus reaches heliocentric distances from 3 to 60 kpc .",
    "the objects in this catalog generally have average absolute @xmath17 magnitudes with uncertainties @xmath55 mag and periods accurate to better than @xmath164 .",
    "more than half of the sources have accurate five - colour photometry from the sdss dr8 release and 1531 have sdss spectra .",
    "although this set of rrab s is incomplete within the survey area ( because of the magnitude , sampling and reddening limits of the data ) , this data set provides a source for more detailed studies of halo streams and structures , as well as a means of constraining the shape , mass and extent of the galactic halo ( koposov et al .",
    "2012 , in prep ) .    here",
    "we provide a first comparison with models of the sagittarius stream , a find a few discrepancies that should eventually lead to a better understanding of the formation history of the milky way halo and its dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "the current data set reaches declinations @xmath165 which extends it @xmath166 beyond the limits of most sources in the sdss survey .",
    "more than 10,000 rrab have been discovered in photometry from sss survey in the region @xmath167 ( torrealba et al .",
