    "<S> we present a geometrical gravitational theory which reduces to einstein s theory for weak gravitational potentials and which has a singularity - free analog of the schwarzschild metric .    despite its geometrical elegance , </S>",
    "<S> einstein s general theory@xcite is plagued by singular solutions which destroy global predictability . </S>",
    "<S> it has long been hoped that a new , non - singular theory of gravity might be found , from which einstein s theory emerges as a low - energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> we shall present the static spherically symmetric solution to a close relative of einstein gravity , which suggests that we may have found such a theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the essential new physics comes from endowing the gravitational field with additional degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this additional freedom gives the field the ability to smooth out the energy density of a point source over a small but finite region , thus removing any singular behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> the theory we shall study was first put forward as a theory of gravity in 1979@xcite , after it was realized that the field equations of einstein - straus unified field theory@xcite did not describe a unification of electromagnetism and gravity , but rather a generalized theory of gravity . unlike general relativity , the metric tensor in this theory is not assumed to be symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> this means that both the manifold and the tangent space transform under @xmath0 , while in general relativity the tangent space is restricted to the lorentz sub - group , @xmath1 , of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting theory was called nonsymmetric gravitational theory ( ngt ) .    the phenomenology of ngt which has been described in the literature to - date@xcite turns out to be a singular subset of the full theory . both general relativity and </S>",
    "<S> the previously studied sector of ngt emerge as singular limits of the complete theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall present an exact , non - singular analog of the schwarzschild solution for ngt . </S>",
    "<S> the spacetime this solution describes has no event horizons and no curvature singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the solution set is parameterized by two constants of integration , @xmath2 and @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> . we can identify @xmath2 as the gravitational mass by taking the newtonian limit of the solution . </S>",
    "<S> the second constant , @xmath3 , is a dimensionless coupling constant which we shall call the skewness parameter , since it controls the size of the skew - metric contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that in the weak field limit , the skew sector of the theory behaves as @xmath4 for large @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linear coupling to mass emphasizes the purely geometrical nature of this new sector .    for strong fields we shall see that the limit @xmath6 is non - analytic . </S>",
    "<S> this means that there are no event horizons or singularities for any @xmath7 , while there are both horizons and curvature singularities when @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> that is what we mean when we say that general relativity ( and the old solutions to ngt ) are singular limits of the full theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the most general solution to the field equations for ngt introduces a third constant of integration , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this constant is known as the ngt charge , and has the dimensions of a length squared . </S>",
    "<S> since this charge arises from a conserved current , it has been postulated that it is proportional to conserved particle number . </S>",
    "<S> all previous work on ngt has been based on this charge being non - zero . to simplify our current presentation </S>",
    "<S> , we shall take the ngt charge to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> this results in no essential loss of generality since the full theory is non - singular for arbitrary @xmath9 , so long as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this choice emphasizes the fact that no new matter couplings are needed to obtain non - singular solutions .    </S>",

    "<S> \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the most general , spherically symmetric metric for ngt was found by papapetrou@xcite to be @xmath17 in this paper we shall take the ngt charge to be zero which demands @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> papapetrou gave a special , unphysical solution to field equations for this metric which had @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is discarded since the resulting metric is not of minkowskian form for large @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> while studying the general wave behaviour of ngt@xcite , we found that asymptotically minkowskian solutions could be found with @xmath20 , since this corresponds to @xmath21 fall - off in orthonormal coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the static spherically symmetric solutions found by wyman@xcite , bonnor@xcite and vanstone@xcite for the field equations of unified field theory share this asymptotic behaviour@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this lead us to adapt their solutions to ngt , and we found that the resulting solution proved to be free of singularities .    </S>",
    "<S> the metric functions are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath5 , and @xmath24 is given implicitly by the relation : @xmath25 for small @xmath5 this relation has multiple branches of solutions for @xmath24 , but only one of these branches matches onto the unique solution of @xmath24 for large @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall only be interested in the unique inversion of ( [ impl ] ) which yields an asymptotically flat spacetime .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we can only invert ( [ impl ] ) analytically for @xmath26 and @xmath27 and we must resort to numerical methods to establish the intermediate behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> starting in familiar territory , we find for @xmath28 and @xmath29 that the metric takes the near - schwarzschild form : @xmath30 where the higher order terms in @xmath31 include higher powers of @xmath3 also . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for large @xmath5 the ngt corrections to the schwarzschild solution are small for any @xmath32 , and can be arbitrarily small if @xmath3 is close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , experimental predictions such as the bending of light by the sun and the perihelion advance of mercury will only be minutely affected by having @xmath3 non - zero .    </S>",
    "<S> near the origin we can develop expansions where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading terms are @xmath35 where @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 the above equation clearly illustrates the non - analytic nature of the limit @xmath38 in the strong field region . </S>",
    "<S> we shall postulate that @xmath3 is always strictly greater than zero , and refer to this new phenomenology for ngt as non - singular gravity or nsg .    </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results confirm that all the expansions we have exhibited produce excellent approximations to the exact solution in their respective regions of validity .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 . shows how @xmath39 behaves in the region where neither of our expansions are valid , for the choices @xmath8 ( gr ) and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for nsg the redshift is finite between any two points in the spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum redshift is between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and is given by @xmath43 put another way , we find that a timelike killing vector at spatial infinity remains timelike throughout the spacetime - our solution is free of event horizons .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 . shows the inward radial acceleration of a static observer near @xmath44 for the choice @xmath40 . unlike gr , we see that the acceleration is finite at @xmath44 . the radial acceleration in ngt </S>",
    "<S> is given by the familiar expression @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> near @xmath41 we find @xmath46 while for large @xmath5 we have @xmath47 at large distances we have a new , repulsive , @xmath48 contribution to the gravitational `` force '' which is of little interest . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the situation near @xmath41 is dramatically different from gr , since the `` force '' vanishes in nsg whereas it is infinite in gr . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the acceleration curve for initially static observers in nsg is reminiscent of the acceleration curves one finds for extended matter distributions such as planets or stars . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration goes roughly as @xmath21 outside the body and tails off smoothly to zero inside the body . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the fact that in nsg the degrees of freedom associated with the skew field @xmath49 are able to distribute the energy of the point source over an extended region . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 . shows a plot of the invariant @xmath50}g^{[\\theta\\phi]})^{1/2}=f/\\sqrt{f^2+r^4}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> for large @xmath5 we find @xmath51 , while at the origin @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath53 is negligible outside of @xmath44 , while below @xmath44 it quickly rises to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial dependence exhibited by @xmath53 is similar to the energy density profile of a compact object with radius @xmath44 , and suggests the mechanism by which the singularities can be avoided .    </S>",
    "<S> the vanishing of the radial acceleration at @xmath41 leads us to expect that the curvature is non - singular at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> this expectation is confirmed by an explicit calculation of the generalized curvature invariants . </S>",
    "<S> ngt generally has more curvature invariants than gr . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fact that @xmath54}=0 $ ] for the solution we are studying reduces the number that needs to be calculated to four . </S>",
    "<S> direct numerical evaluation shows that the curvature is non - singular for all @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> since there is a coordinate singularity in @xmath55 at @xmath41 , it is also important to establish analytically that there is no curvature singularityat @xmath41 , rather than relying on our numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> using the expansions ( [ g ] ) , ( [ a ] ) and ( [ f ] ) , we found all the curvature invariants to be finite . </S>",
    "<S> a representative invariant is the generalized kretschmann scalar , which is given to leading order in @xmath3 by @xmath56 all the non - vanishing curvatures are of the form @xmath57 at the origin and @xmath58 for large @xmath5 , which is to be expected on dimensional grounds . </S>",
    "<S> these results are again reminiscent of some extended energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the non - vanishing curvature invariants at the center of a star are proportional to the local energy density @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with this picture we see that the curvature is smaller for larger values of @xmath3 since for large @xmath3 the skew field is better able to smooth out the would - be singularity at @xmath41 .    while all the results we have presented suggest that nsg sector of ngt is indeed a non - singular theory of gravity , there is still much to be understood . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious question is whether the spacetime we have described would ever be reached as the endpoint of gravitational collapse . since gravity tends to turn off at very short distances , it is perhaps more likely that some kind of super - dense object might form with the metric we have described as its exterior spacetime </S>",
    "<S> . observationally it would be difficult to distinguish such objects from black - holes . </S>",
    "<S> looking beyond the limitations of a static spherically symmetric solution , we need to understand the role played by the @xmath3 parameter in more general settings . </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath3 related to a new fundamental constant which controls the cross - coupling of the skew and symmetric parts of the geometry , or is it just a parameter which varies from one solution to the next ? at the linearized level , we know@xcite that @xmath3 can be considered as a coupling constant between the three divergence - free parts of @xmath60}$ ] and the rest of the @xmath61 s , but this understanding is of little use in the strong field regime where these degrees of freedom are most important . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting question is whether a similar smoothing effect by the skew metric can eliminate cosmological singularities such as the big bang . </S>",
    "<S> for now we will have to be content with a non - singular analog of the schwarzschild geometry . </S>"
