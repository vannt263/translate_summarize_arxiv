    "in spite of the success of the standard model ( sm ) in explaining the particle interactions , there are yet two unsolved questions in the sm .",
    "one is the fine tuning problem and the other is the existence of the dark matter ( dm ) in our universe .    the fine tuning problem is the question why the higgs is likely to be so light as expected from the lep data ( @xmath7 at the 95% confidence level @xcite ) , while naturally the higgs mass is the order of the cut off scale of the theory due to radiative corrections .",
    "some mechanism should protect the higgs mass , and interactions involving the higgs sector should be extended from the sm one .",
    "the existence of the dm is now established by the cosmological observations such as wmap , sdss and sn - ia @xcite . the sm should be extended to include the dm , which should be a neutral stable particle .",
    "moreover , provided that the dm is a thermal relic whose strength of the coupling to the sm particles of the order of the weak interaction , the mass can be a few 100  gev from a rough dimensional analysis .    to solve the fine tuning problem ,",
    "many models have been proposed .",
    "however , a so - called little hierarchy problem \" @xcite arises in these models , once constraints from precision measurements are imposed .",
    "new operators arising from these models naively have the cut off scale @xmath8 tev to be consistent to the experimental data @xcite .    some successful models solving the little hierarchy problem have parity structures , for example the mssm with r - parity @xcite , the little higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) @xcite , or the universal extra dimensional model ( ued ) with kk - parity @xcite .",
    "such a model which has a parity structure predicts the stable lightest parity odd particle as a candidate of the dm .",
    "the cut off scale of new operators in the model can be as low as a few tev @xcite , and the mass of the lightest parity odd particle can be on the order of a few 100  gev .",
    "the lhc is starting soon , and it is likely to discover new particles with masses up to a few tev @xcite .",
    "the models mentioned above are studied intensively by many authors .",
    "all of these models have partners of the sm colored particles which decay into the stable lightest parity odd particle through the parity conserving interactions .    at the lhc ,",
    "these partners are produced in pairs .",
    "the signal is multiple high @xmath9 jets and high @xmath9 leptons , each accompanied by missing transverse momentum @xmath10 . among the signals studied so far , the signals with high @xmath9 leptons are very promising @xcite , because the sm backgrounds are smaller .",
    "however , branching ratios of new particles into leptons strongly depend on model parameters .",
    "in addition , jets + leptons signals are often accompanied by undetectable neutrinos , which are also the source of missing momentum .",
    "they sometimes reduce the significance of the kinematical endpoints of the signal distributions for mass reconstructions . and even in the case that the lepton branching ratios are small , events with multiple jets and no lepton are enormously produced .    in this paper , we focus on the top partner signal in the lht .",
    "the top partner pair productions occur with sizable cross section @xcite compared with stop pair productions in the mssm because the top partner is a fermion .",
    "the event has simple kinematics , @xmath11 where top quarks are highly boosted signals have been discussed in the rs1 model  @xcite .",
    "however , it is different from the signal considered in this paper , because it is not accompanied by @xmath10 . ] .",
    "decay products from a boosted top are collimated and they are easily identified as a jet system with mass @xmath12 with high probability using hemisphere analysis  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , by imposing lepton veto and top tagging , background events from @xmath13jets can be reduced significantly .",
    "the process above was partly studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the paper , comphep @xcite and herwig6.5 @xcite",
    "are used for the event generation and acerdet1.0 @xcite is used for the detector simulation and jet reconstruction .",
    "acerdet1.0 implements the snowmass cone algorithm",
    ". however , the algorithm is not optimized in resolving the overlapping jets arising from boosted top quark correctly .",
    "recently , fastjet @xcite was released . infrared stable jet reconstruction algorithms ( kt @xcite , cambridge @xcite , siscone @xcite )",
    "are implemented in the code , which is significantly faster than previous codes .",
    "we study improvements with these advanced jet reconstruction algorithms . in this study , we interface acerdet calorimeter information to fastjet and reanalyze the same process as in ref .",
    "@xcite to compare the results .",
    "we find the kt and cambridge algorithm have advantage to resolve overlapping jets .",
    "we also generate the signal events with underlying events using herwig6.5 + jimmy @xcite , and find the jet resolution with the kt algorithm is significantly affected by underlying events .",
    "this motivates us to show results with the cambridge algorithm mainly in this paper .",
    "we study the potential to measure the mass of the top partner using the reconstructed top candidates , although only the discovery potential is discussed in ref .",
    "one of the important variable is a @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 is a function of two visible momenta , a missing transverse momentum and a test mass . in the case that the mass of the lightest @xmath2-odd particle ( @xmath14 ) is known , the endpoint of the @xmath5 distribution is equal to the top partner mass at @xmath15 .",
    "therefore we can measure the top partner mass @xmath16 using this distribution .",
    "we also generate the standard model backgrounds using alpgen @xcite+ herwig and conclude that they do not affect the endpoint of the @xmath5 distribution .",
    "we also discuss top polarization effects .",
    "a typical lht model predicts a top partner which decays dominantly into a right - handed top quark @xmath17 and a heavy photon @xmath3 .",
    "the polarization of tops can be measured through investigating decay distributions of tops .",
    "and we show that there are distinguishable difference between completely polarized case and non - polarized case in jet level analysis .",
