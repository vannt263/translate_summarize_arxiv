    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are produced by a relativistic outflow from a compact source .",
    "the outflow sweeps up the external medium and drives a strong relativistic shock into it .",
    "eventually the outflow is decelerated ( by @xmath7 work across the contact discontinuity that separates the ejecta and the shocked external medium ) and most of the kinetic energy is transferred to the shocked external medium ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the shocked external medium produces long lived afterglow emission that is detected in the x - rays , optical , and radio for days , weeks , and months , respectively , after the grb .",
    "the afterglow emission is thought to be predominantly synchrotron radiation .",
    "this is supported both by the broad band spectrum and by the detection of linear polarization at the level of a few percent in the optical ( or near infrared ) afterglow of several grbs ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "inverse - compton scattering of the synchrotron photons might dominate the observed flux in the x - rays in some cases @xcite .    in the pre-_swift _",
    "era the best monitoring of grb afterglow light curves was , by far , in the optical .",
    "most afterglow light curves showed a smooth power law decay @xcite , and often also a smooth achromatic transition to a steeper power law decay that is attributed to the outflow being collimated into a narrow jet @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the smoothness of the afterglow light curve is directly related to ( and thus enables to constrain ) the smoothness of the external density field .",
    "nevertheless , some optical afterglows have shown significant temporal variability , with strong deviations from the more typical smooth power law behavior .",
    "the best examples are grbs 021004 @xcite and 030329 @xcite .",
    "possible explanations for such temporal variability in grb afterglow light curves include variations in the external density @xcite , or in the energy of the afterglow shock .",
    "the latter includes energy injection by `` refreshed shocks ''  slower shells of ejecta that catch up with the afterglow shock on long time scales @xcite or a `` patchy shell ''  angular inhomogeneities within the outflow @xcite .",
    "another possible cause for variability in the afterglow light curve , although it is expected to be quite rare , is microlensing by an intervening star in a galaxy that happens to be close to our line of sight .",
    "grb  000301c exhibited an achromatic bump in its optical to nir light curves that peaked after @xmath8days @xcite which had been interpreted as such a microlensing event @xcite , although other interpretations such as a bump in the external density have also been suggested @xcite .",
    "recent observations by _ swift _ have found flares in the early x - ray afterglows of many grbs @xcite which are probably due to late time activity of the central source @xcite .",
    "early optical variability also appears to be more common than previously thought ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is not yet clear if it is caused by similar mechanisms as the late time optical variability that had been detected before _",
    "the most natural forms of variations in the external density are either clumps on top of a smooth background density distribution , or a global abrupt change in density with radius .",
    "the latter can be , e.g. , the termination shock of the wind from the massive star progenitor of a long - soft grb @xcite .",
    "such a stellar wind environment may have a richer structure and can include an abrupt increase in density with radius at the contact discontinuity between shocked wind from two different evolutionary stages of the progenitor star , as well as clumps that are formed due to rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite .",
    "density clumps with a mild density contrast may also be formed due to turbulence in the external medium .",
    "furthermore , the external density profile is expected to vary between different progenitor models @xcite .",
    "the variability that had been observed in optical afterglows was attributed to density clumps in the external medium @xcite .",
    "the expected observational signatures of the afterglow shock running into the wind termination shock of the massive star progenitor have also been considered @xcite . in all these cases it has been argued that there would be a clear observational signature in the form of a rebrightening in the afterglow light curve , before approaching the new shallower decay slope corresponding to the uniform density of the shocked wind .    here",
    "we revisit the effect of density fluctuations on the afterglow light curve by solving in detail the case of a spherically symmetric external density with a single density jump ( by a factor of @xmath9 ) at some radius @xmath10 , while the density at smaller and larger radii is a ( generally different ) power law in radius .",
    "this is done by constructing a semi - analytic model for the observed flux due to synchrotron emission at different power law segments of the spectrum and by carrying out numerical simulations .",
    "the semi - analytic model takes into account the effect of the reverse shock on the hydrodynamics and on the emissivity , as well as the effect of the spherical geometry on the arrival time of photons to the observer .",
    "being semi - analytic , however , this model uses some approximations for the hydrodynamic evolution and the resulting radiation .",
    "therefore , we also perform numerical simulations in which the light curves are calculated using a hydrodynamic+radiation numerical code .",
    "this code self - consistently calculates the radiation and evolves the electron distribution in every fluid element , which corresponds to a computational cell of the one dimensional lagrangian hydrodynamic code .",
    "the results of this code are used to obtain light curves in cases of special interest and near spectral break frequencies , as well as to verify the quality of the semi - analytic model , which is found to agree well with the numerical results .",
    "these calculations are much more accurate than those presented in previous works , and our results are significantly different . in all cases",
    "we find a very smooth transition to the new asymptotic power law , with no rebrightening for an initially decaying light curve .    in  [ sec : spherical ] we develop the semi - analytic model .",
    "first , in  [ sec : hydro ] a simple analytic model is constructed for the hydrodynamics , which agrees very well with our numerical results .",
    "then , in  [ sec : rad ] we construct a semi - analytic model for the observed flux density",
    ". specific case studies (  [ sec : case study ] ) are then analyzed in detail , for a wind termination shock (  [ sec : wind ] ) and for a spherical density jump in a uniform medium (  [ sec : uniform ] ) .",
    "the light curves for these cases are also calculated using the numerical code ( described in appendix [ sec : code ] ) .",
    "the effect of proximity to a break frequency around the time of the density jump is investigated in  [ sec : nu_break ] , and our main conclusions are found to remain valid also in the vicinity of the break frequencies . ",
    "[ sec : clump ] is devoted to a discussion of the expected observational signatures of density clumps on top of a smooth underlying external density distribution .",
    "such density clumps are found to have a very weak observational signature which would be very hard to detect . in  [ sec : grbs ] we discuss the implications of our results for the origin of the observed fluctuations in several grb afterglows .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "in this section we model a spherical relativistic blast wave that propagates into a power - law external density profile ( @xmath11 with @xmath12 ) which has a single sharp density jump ( by a factor @xmath9 ) at some radius @xmath13 .",

    "such a large increase in @xmath2 over a relatively small factor in time is hard to accommodate by a jump in the external density : @xmath384 requires @xmath385 and even then it is hard to achieve such an increase in @xmath2 over a factor of @xmath383 in time .",
    "the second rebrightening episode lies within the tail of the first , and is therefore not a very `` clean '' case to study .",
    "the third rebrightening epoch at @xmath386days is somewhat more isolated , and has @xmath387 where most of the increase in @xmath2 is within about a factor of @xmath388 in time .",
    "this is extremely hard to achieve by variations in the external density . on the other hand , angular fluctuations in the energy per solid angle within the jet ( a `` patchy shell '' ) nicely",
    "account for both the fluctuations in the light curve and the variability in the linear polarization of this afterglow @xcite .",
    "grb  000301c displayed a largely achromatic bump in its optical to nir light curves @xcite peaking at @xmath389days . before the bump @xmath390 and during the rise to the bump @xmath2 became slightly positive , so that @xmath391 , where most of the increase in @xmath2 occurred over a factor of @xmath388 in time .",
    "we find that this can not be produced by a sudden change in the external density ( as has been suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "the decay just after the peak of the bump is very sharp , @xmath392 , and since @xmath393 ( * ? ? ? * find @xmath394 during the decay just after the peak , at @xmath395days ) this requires a deviation from spherical symmetry @xcite , and might not be easy to achieve with angular fluctuations in the energy per solid angle within the jet ( a `` patchy shell '' ) or aspherical refreshed shocks . in this case",
    "an alternative microlensing interpretation @xcite was shown to be able to nicely reproduce the shape of the bump @xcite .",
    "grb  030329 has one of the best monitored and densely sampled optical afterglow light curves to date .",
    "it is presented in great detail by @xcite who clearly show that the light curve contains several rebrightening ( @xmath284 ) episodes in which @xmath396 .",
    "all of these episodes have a similar structure and occur over a small factor in time ( @xmath397 ) .",
    "in previous works it has been suggested that some of these rebrightening episodes are a result of density fluctuations .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the first ( and largest ) rebrightening episode is the signature of a wind termination shock . @xcite",
    "have followed @xcite in attributing the first rebrightening episode to a two - component jet , but argued that the subsequent rebrightening episodes could be explained by variations in the external density .",
    "our results clearly show that none of the bumps in the optical light curve of grb  030329 can be a result of density bumps .",
    "this implies that the two - jet model of @xcite and @xcite fails to account for most of the observed light - curve fluctuations .",
    "excluding density fluctuations as the possible source of any of the major bumps , together with the similarity in the shapes of the bumps @xcite , support a sequence of similar episodes in which the energy of the jet fluctuates , such as a late time energy injection by `` refreshed shocks '' @xcite .",
    "the afterglow of the very recent short - hard grb  060313 has been monitored both by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and by the optical / ultra - violate telescope ( uvot ) on board _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "the optical / uv light curve showed three sharp bumps / flares at @xmath398hr , @xmath399hr , and @xmath400hr , with an amplitude of more than a factor of 2 in flux and a very short rise time of @xmath401 . during the same time the x - ray light curve showed a smooth ( and steeper ) power law decay .",
    "this was interpreted by @xcite as the result of variations in the external density by a factor of @xmath402 , where the lack of variability in the x - rays was attributed to @xmath111 being between the optical / uv and the x - rays .",
    "our results clearly show that such sharp rebrightening episodes as were seen in the optical / uv afterglow light curve of grb  060313 can not be the result of variations in the external density .",
    "therefore , there must be some other cause for this variability , such as late time internal shocks with a very soft spectrum , as was suggested by @xcite as an alternative mechanism .",
    "we have presented a semi - analytic model for the light - curve resulting from synchrotron emission by a spherical relativistic blast - wave that propagates into a power law external density profile with a single sharp density jump at some radius @xmath10 .",
    "our solution is general enough to include a transition in the density power - law index ( @xmath14 ) at @xmath10 , but is limited to cases in which the blast - wave remains relativistic after it encounters the density jump .",
    "this model has been used to explore in detail two density profiles that are most relevant to grb afterglows : a wind termination shock , and a sharp density jump between two regions of uniform density .",
    "the latter results are also used to constrain the signature of density clumps in a uniform medium .",
    "we have also carried out detailed numerical simulations for several of the cases which we have studied in detail .",
    "these numerical results serve three purposes .",
    "first , they are used in order to obtain more accurate light curves for the cases which are of special interest .",
    "second , they are appropriate for calculating the light curves in the vicinity of a spectral break frequency (  [ sec : nu_break ] ) .",
    "third , they serve as a test for the quality of our simple semi - analytic model , which is found to give a very good qualitative description and reasonable quantitative description of the light curve .",
    "our main result is that density jumps do not produce sharp features in the light curve , regardless of their density contrast !",
    "the results of our specific case studies are as follows.a wind termination shock :    * the light curve shows a smooth transition , which lasts for about one decade in time , between the asymptotic power - law behavior at @xmath220 and at @xmath221 .",
    "* there is no rebrightening or any other sharp feature that can be used as a clear observational signature .",
    "* above the cooling frequency , @xmath111 , there is no change in the asymptotic value of the temporal index , @xmath2 , and it only fluctuates with a small amplitude ( @xmath403 ) . * the only observable signatures of a wind termination shock are a smooth break , with an increase of @xmath225 in @xmath2 , below @xmath111 and a transition in the temporal evolution of @xmath111 .    a density jump between two uniform density regions :    * the light curve shows a smooth transition between the two asymptotic power laws ( at @xmath220 and @xmath221 ) . * the transition time increases with the density contrast , @xmath5 , and is about @xmath404 . *",
    "the maximal deviation , @xmath1 , of the temporal index @xmath2 from its asymptotic value ( at @xmath220 and @xmath221 ) is small .",
    "for example , @xmath405 ; @xmath1 depends weakly on @xmath5 and approaches @xmath263 at very large @xmath5 values .",
    "therefore , a density jump can not produce an optical rebrightening when @xmath406 . *",
    "the light curve fluctuates also above @xmath111 ( typically including the x - ray band ) .",
    "while the asymptotic flux ( at @xmath407 ) above @xmath111 is unaffected by the density jump , the fluctuations in @xmath2 are _ comparable _ to those below @xmath111 .    an overdense clump on top of a uniform density background :    * only a fairly large clump ( @xmath376 ) with a sufficiently large density contrast ( @xmath377 ) produces a significant fluctuation in the light curve . *",
    "the effect of a clump on the light curve is significantly larger when it is located along the line of sight , than at an angle of @xmath408 from the line of sight . *",
    "the signature of a clump is most apparent at @xmath409 . * above @xmath110 a clump can actually cause a small dip in the light curve , while below @xmath110 it causes a ( larger ) bump .    for a spherical",
    "density jump our conclusions are based on accurate results , while in the case of a density clump we obtain only an approximate upper limit for its effect on the light - curve .",
    "therefore , our results for density clumps should be taken only as rough guidelines .",
    "our main results remain valid also when the observed frequency is close to a spectral break frequency around the time of the density jump .",
    "our conclusions are very different from those of previous works , which predicted a significant optical rebrightening , and rather sharp features in the afterglow light curve .",
    "the main cause for this difference is our careful consideration of both the effect of the reverse shock on the dynamics ( which we find can not be neglected even when @xmath285 ) , and the arrival time of the photons to the observer from different parts of the emitting regions .",
    "both of these effects tend to smoothen the light curve significantly .    finally , we considered the implications of our results for the origin of the fluctuations in the highly variable light curves of four grbs ( 3 long - soft grbs and one short - hard grb ) .",
    "we find that density variations are unlikely to be the source of the fluctuations in any of these bursts .",

    "in order to obtain accurate light curves while relying on a minimal number of approximations we use a one dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic code and combine it with an optically thin synchrotron radiation module .",
    "this is the same code that was used before in @xcite .",
    "we use a one dimensional hydrodynamic code that was generously provided to us by reem sari and shiho kobayashi .",
    "it is a lagrangian code based on a second - order gudanov method with an exact ultra - relativistic riemann solver and it is described and used in @xcite and @xcite . on top of this code we have constructed a module that calculates the resulting optically thin synchrotron radiation .",
    "the code does not include the synchrotron self - absorption or synchrotron self - compton processes .",
    "the effect of the radiation on the hydrodynamics is neglected .",
    "below we describe the physics that is included in the radiation module .",
    "having the full hydrodynamic evolution of the fluid ( from the hydrodynamic code ) we first identify the time steps in which a given fluid element is shocked by finding episodes of increase in its entropy .",
    "the same fluid element can be shocked many times . once a fluid element is shocked all its",
    "electrons are assumed to be instantly accelerated into a power - law energy distribution with an index @xmath46 , @xmath410 for @xmath411 .",
    "the energy in the electrons is taken as a constant fraction , @xmath412 , of the internal energy , and this condition determines @xmath413 ( it is assumed that @xmath414 ) . from this point on , and until the same fluid element is shocked again , the electron energy distribution decouples from the internal energy and evolves through radiative cooling and adiabatic cooling or heating ( @xmath415 work ) .",
    "the magnetic energy in each fluid element is taken to be a constant fraction , @xmath416 , of the internal energy at all times .",
    "one of the main difficulties in calculating the synchrotron radiation at high frequencies is the short cooling time , which may be much shorter than the hydrodynamic time steps . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we calculate the radiation during any hydrodynamic time step analytically , in the following way .",
    "immediately after a fluid element crosses a shock , its initial electron energy distribution is taken to be a power - law ( with index @xmath46 ) between @xmath413 and @xmath417 .",
    "the total emissivity of the fluid element at a given frequency in its own rest frame , during a time step , is obtained by integrating the spectral power of individual electrons over the evolving electron distribution , where each electron is tagged by the value of its initial lorentz factor .",
    "the emission of each electron is obtained by time integration over its instantaneous emissivity of each electron is approximated in the usual manner @xcite : @xmath418 . ] , which in turn depends on the evolution of its lorentz factor ( and thus on its initial lorentz factor ) during the time step .",
    "this evolution is calculated by considering its radiative losses and its adiabatic cooling or heating .",
    "in particular , we calculate the evolution of an electron with initial lorentz factor @xmath413 and of an electron with initial lorentz factor @xmath419 .",
    "their values at the end of the time step are taken as the initial values for the next step in which the initial distribution of electrons lorentz factors is taken again as a power - law between the new values of @xmath413 and @xmath419 . from the point where @xmath419 becomes comparable to @xmath413 ( within a factor of 2 )",
    "the electron energy distribution is taken as a delta function .    since we use a one dimensional code in spherical coordinates , which explicitly assumes spherical symmetry , each fluid element represents a thin spherical shell .",
    "once the rest frame spectral power of a fluid element is calculated , we integrate over the contribution of this shell to the observed flux at a given observer time and observer frequency .",
    "this calculation takes into account the appropriate lorentz transformation of the radiation field and photon arrival time from each point along the shell ."
