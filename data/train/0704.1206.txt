    "elasticity theory in homogeneous materials is a well developed subject . much less",
    "is known about inhomogeneous materials where the solution of the basic equations of elasticity becomes very involved . in this paper",
    "we focus on a material which consists of one finite area ( of arbitrary shape ) in which a material with given elastic properties is embedded in an infinite sheet of material of different elastic properties .",
    "this situation is known as  elastic inhomogeneity \" and it appears in a variety of solid mechanical contexts .",
    "previous studies have concentrated on solving this problem for the relatively symmetric case of an ellipse @xcite where it was solved analytically . in other cases",
    "the problem was solved for small perturbations to the circle @xcite .",
    "mathematically the problem is set as follows , and see fig .",
    "[ patch ] .",
    "a patch of material of type 1 occupies an area @xmath0 and is delineated by a sharp boundary which will be denoted @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of the infinite plane is made of material of type 2 .",
    "the material is subjected to forces at infinity ( and see below the precise boundary conditions ) , and is therefore deformed . before the deformation",
    "each point of the material is assigned a point @xmath2 in the two - dimensional plane .",
    "the forces at infinity result in a displacement of the material points to a new equilibrium position @xmath3 .",
    "the displacement field @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 the strain field is defined accordingly as @xmath6/2 \\ .\\ ] ] in the context of linear elasticity in isotropic materials one then introduces the stress field according to hook s law @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 take on different values @xmath11 , @xmath12 in @xmath0 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 in the rest of the material . in equilibrium",
    "the stress tensor should be divergenceless @xmath15 at each point in the sheet . by defining the stress ( or airy ) potential u : @xmath16",
    "the former equation for the stress tensor becomes a partial differential equation for the stress potential : @xmath17 this equation , which is known as the bi - laplace or the bi - harmonic equation is conveniently solved as a non - analytic combination of analytic funcitons . to this aim",
    "we introduce the complex notation @xmath18 , and note the general solutions of eq .",
    "( [ bilaplace ] ) in the form @xmath19 \\ , \\label{uphichi}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are any two holomorphic functions . what remains to do in any particular problem is to find the unique analytic functions such that the stress tensor satisfies the boundary conditions .",
    "this stress tensor is determined by the two holomorphic functions as : @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\ \\sigma_{xx}(x , y)&=&\\re [ 2 \\tilde\\varphi'(z)-\\bar z\\tilde\\varphi''(z)-\\eta''(z)]\\nonumber\\\\ \\sigma_{xy}(x , y)&=&\\im [ \\bar z\\tilde\\varphi''(z)+\\eta''(z)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define for convenience : @xmath24 and then : @xmath25\\nonumber\\\\ \\sigma_{xx}(x , y)&=&\\re [ 2 \\tilde\\varphi'(z)-\\bar z\\tilde\\varphi''(z)-\\tilde\\psi'(z)]\\nonumber\\\\ \\sigma_{xy}(x , y)&=&\\im [ \\bar z\\tilde\\varphi''(z)+\\tilde\\psi'(z)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the stress tensor is determined by derivatives of the holomorphic functions , and not by the functions themselves .",
    "this leaves us with some freedom , since the functions can be changed with the following gauge : @xmath26 as we shall see below , not all these gauge freedoms are true freedoms once we introduce the boundary and continuity conditions",
    ". since the elastic properties are different inside and outside @xmath0 , the potential functions will be different in the two regions : @xmath27 and @xmath28 which are defined on @xmath0 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are defined on @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless we will demand continuity of the physical fields .",
    "in particular the normal force @xmath32 and the displacement @xmath33 must be continues across the interface ( by newton s third law ) in the absence of surface tension .",
    "therefore the continuity conditions are : @xmath34 @xmath35 the continuity conditions for the stress , can be rewritten as : @xmath36 or , after integrating : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a complex constant of integration . in terms of the holomorphic functions ,",
    "the condition ( [ constress ] ) translates to @xcite :    @xmath39    and the condition ( [ condis ] ) becomes : @xmath40}{\\mu_1}=\\frac{[\\kappa_2\\tilde\\varphi^{(2)}(z)\\!-\\!z\\overline{\\tilde\\varphi'^{(2)}(z)}\\!-\\!\\overline{\\tilde\\psi^{(2)}(z)}]}{\\mu_2 } \\ .\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "in addition to these continuity conditions on @xmath42 we need to specify boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "we choose @xmath43",
    "solutions to the problem of finding the stress field _ outside _ a given domain using conformal maps were described for example in @xcite . here",
    "we need to solve for the stress field both inside and outside the given domain . in the following",
    "we assume that the center of coordinates is inside @xmath0 and the point at infinity is outside @xmath0 .",
    "since the stress functions are holomorphic in their domains of definition , we can expand them in the appropriate laurent series , which for the functions with superscript ( 1 ) is of the form @xmath44 i.e. we have no poles at the origin .",
    "for the outside domain ( functions with superscript ( 2 ) ) the most general expansions in agreement with the boundary conditions ( [ bcinfty ] ) are of the form    @xmath45    i.e we have a pole of order 1 at infinity .",
    "accordingly , the leading terms of eqs .",
    "( [ laurent2 ] ) are determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "we now use one of the gauge freedoms to eliminate the imaginary part of @xmath46 and write : @xmath47    the standard way to proceed @xcite would be to substitute the series expansions in the continuity conditions and find the linear equations that determine all the coefficients by equating terms of the same order in @xmath48",
    ". however this can not be done in general since the functions @xmath49 are not orthogonal on arbitrary contours @xmath42 . to overcome this , one maps the regions @xmath0 and @xmath31 into the interior and exterior of the unit circle , respectively .",
    "that is , we need two holomorphic , invertible ( and thus conformal ) functions , one is @xmath50 which maps the exterior of the unit circle into @xmath31 , and the other is @xmath51 which maps the unit disk into @xmath0 .",
    "since they are both invertible they have inverse functions which we denote @xmath52 and @xmath53    now we express the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 and then expand them on the boundary of the unit circle .",
    "this expansion will be a fourier series where the powers of @xmath56 or @xmath57 satisfies the orthogonality relation : @xmath58 we have here used @xmath59 to represent either @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "the orthogonality allows us to equate the coefficients of the series term by term .",
    "we define : @xmath60 and : @xmath61 we can expand @xmath62 and @xmath63 in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 on the unit circle . since the original functions were holomorphic and meromorphic in the original domains , the functions : @xmath64 and : @xmath65 are holomorphic inside and outside the unit disc , respectively .",
    "therefore we can expand in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath66 @xmath67 we now assume that the map of the exterior domain , @xmath68 , maps the point at infinity to infinity .",
    "that is , it will have a laurent series on the form @xmath69 from this we get the following relations ( after substituting and taking the limit @xmath70 ) : @xmath71 we can also use the last two freedoms to choose @xmath72 such that @xmath73 . in the interior domain , the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 also have five freedom .",
    "however , the requirement of continuity of the displacement field @xmath76 across the boundary @xmath1 removes three of these freedoms .",
    "this continuity was expressed by eq .",
    "( [ condis ] ) . applying the apparent gauge freedoms on the lhs of that equation and then subtracting the resulting equation from eq .",
    "( [ condis ] ) we find the three conditions @xmath77    using the remaining two freedoms , we can eliminate the constant term in the expansion of @xmath78 by setting @xmath79 . note that this is possible only when we choose @xmath80 such that @xmath81 .",
    "we may always define our mapping @xmath82 such that this is satisfied . in terms of the conformal maps we transform the boundary conditions into @xmath83 @xmath84\\nonumber\\\\&&=\\frac{1}{\\mu_2}[\\kappa_2\\varphi^{(2)}(\\omega)-\\frac{\\phi(\\omega)}{\\overline{\\phi'(\\omega)}}\\overline{\\varphi'^{(2)}(\\omega)}-\\overline{\\psi^{(2)}(\\omega ) } ] \\ . \\label{bccrack2conf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "at this point we need to substitute the expansions ( [ laurentp1]),([laurentp2]),([laurent ] ) and an expansion similar to ( [ laurent ] ) for @xmath80 into the equations ( [ bccrack1conf ] ) and ( [ bccrack2conf ] ) and solve for the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "to understand how to do this in principle we write the expanded equations ( [ laurentp1 ] ) and ( [ laurentp2 ] ) in an abstract form @xmath87 where @xmath88 are linear combinations of the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath90 whereas @xmath91 are linear combinations of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "as this equation stands we can not use the orthogonality relation eq .",
    "( [ ortho ] ) .",
    "therefore we expand moments of @xmath56 in terms of @xmath57 in the form @xmath94 we now insert this expression in eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) , @xmath95 and equate the coefficients of same powers to achieve a set of linear equations for the coefficients of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the actual algebraic manipulations that are involved in reaching a _",
    "finite _ set of linear equations are presented in the appendix .",
    "needless to say , when we derive a finite set of equations we lose precision . to see this we note that to get the right number of equations for the number of unknowns ( see appendix ) we need to truncate the summations on the lhs and the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ doublef ] ) at the same finite n , i.e. @xmath98 for a precisely circular inclusion this truncation introduces no loss of information . for this particular shape the expansion eq .",
    "( [ momentexpansion ] ) has only one term with @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "obviously , when the inclusion shape deviates from the circle , the representation of @xmath101 in fourier space deviates from a delta function and it becomes more spread .",
    "an example of this phenomenon is presented in fig.[t1t2 ] for an inclusion in the form of an ellipse with aspect ratio of about 1.5 .",
    "the upper panel shows the paramterization of the outer mapping as function of that of the inner , @xmath102 . in the lower panel",
    "we show the power spectrum @xmath103 of the moments @xmath104 and @xmath105 of the function in the upper panel .",
    "if we truncate the expansion at the dashed line @xmath106 , we lose high frequency information for the higher moments .",
    "this loss of informaion will lead to stress field calculations which are less accurate .    to see",
    "the difficulty in a pictorial way we can consider the field lines of the conformal mappings for an inclusion that is elongated in shape , see for example fig .",
    "[ figfield ] .",
    "the external field lines concentrate at the convex parts of the inclusion , whereas the internal field lines concentrate on the concave parts .",
    "it becomes increasingly difficult to match field lines since they make a large discontinues jump when we go from the interior to the exterior domain .",
    "similarly , for the ellipse in fig .",
    "[ t1t2 ] , when we increase the aspect ratio of the ellipse , the slope in the steep parts of @xmath107 become even larger , requiring higher order frequencies in our expansions . eventually for large aspect ratios , our method will break down .",
    "in all the calculations we assumed that the conformal maps @xmath108 and @xmath80 are available . for",
    "arbitrary inclusion shapes this is far from obvious , and special methods are necessary to obtain these maps .",
    "an efficient method to obtain the conformal map from the exterior of the unit circle to the exterior of an arbitrary given shape had been discussed in great detail in @xcite . in the present case",
    "we use a slightly different method namely the geodesic algorithm @xcite .",
    "this method , like the former one , is based on the iterations of a generic conformal map @xmath109 defined by a set of parameters @xmath110 .",
    "we then construct the conformal map to an arbitrary shape by an appropriate choice of parameters @xmath110 . in the geodesic algorithm , we discretize the interface of the inclusion by a sequence of points @xmath111 .",
    "the points appear sequentially in the positive direction of the interface .",
    "we now briefly summarize how to construct the conformal map ( see @xcite ) .",
    "first we construct iteratively the inverse map that brings the interior of the inclusion to the upper half plane and the interface to the real axis .",
    "the conformal map to the shape then follows directly from the inverse .",
    "the construction is done in three steps . in the first step ,",
    "we move one point to infinity and another to the center of coordinates , e.g. @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively . for that purpose",
    "we use the mapping , @xmath114 in the next step we find a map that connects @xmath115 to the real axis by a semi circular arc .",
    "the inverse of this mapping , @xmath116 , brings @xmath115 to the real axis .",
    "@xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "iteratively , we apply this mapping to all the points @xmath121 where in general @xmath122 in the third and last step we unfold the remaining part of the interior to the whole upper half - plane by the map @xmath123 with @xmath124    the conformal map @xmath125 from the upper half - plane to the interior domain and from the lower half - plane to the exterior domain is then given by @xmath126    from the conformal map @xmath125 we easily construct the map @xmath68 from the unit circle to the inclusion . in fig .",
    "[ mapping ] we illustrate how this is done .",
    "in order to check the validity of our method we calculated the stress fields created by inhomogeneities with 2 different geometries : an ellipse with semi axes @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( aspect ratio of about 1.5 ) and a smoothed triangular curve @xmath129 ( see fig . [ triangle ] ) . in the case of the elliptical inhomogeneity we compared our method to the known analytical solution which was first obtained by hardiman @xcite in 1954 . in the example below , the boundary conditions at infinity were set to @xmath130 .",
    "the shear moduli used were @xmath131 for the inhomogeneity and @xmath132 for the matrix .",
    "the poisson ratio was taken to be @xmath133 for both inhomogeneity and matrix . in figs .",
    "[ figsxx ] and [ figsyy ] we can see the components of the stress field calculated outside the ellipse .    the blue line is the stress calculated using hardiman s solution and the red spots corresponds to the values obtained by our method .",
    "similarly , we have calculated the stress field outside the triangular - like inhomogeneity ( figs [ trigxx ] and [ trigyy ] ) .",
    "in comparing our approach to other available algorithms , for example finite elements approximations to the equations of linear elasticity , we should stress that our approach works equally well for compressible and incompressible materials , there is no problem in taking the incompressible limit as the poisson ratio approaches 1/2 .",
    "this is not the case for finite elements methods . while the examples shown above worked out very well , indicating that the proposed algorithm is both elegant and numerically feasible , unfortunately it deteriorates very quickly when the shape of the inhomogeneity deviates strongly from circular symmetry .",
    "the difficulty in matching the two conformal maps is significant , as can be gleaned from from figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "one could think that the problem could be overcome in principle by increasing the numerical accuracy , but in practice , when the inhomogeneity has horns , spikes or deep fjords , the difficulties becomes insurmountable .",
    "similar difficulties in another guise are however expected when any other analytic or semi - analytic method is used , leaving very contorted inhomogeneities as a remaining challenge for elasticity theory .",
    "this work had been supported in part by the israel science foundation , the german israeli foundation and the minerva foundation .",
    "we thank eran bouchbinder , felipe barra , anna pomyalov and charles tresser for some very useful discussions .",
    "starting from ( [ bccrack1conf ] ) and ( [ bccrack2conf ] ) we write the series expansions in a compact form : @xmath134 @xmath135 were we have eliminated the zero terms in @xmath136 because of the gauge freedom .",
    "substituting : @xmath137 @xmath138 we can also expand : @xmath139 @xmath140 substituting and changing the indices of summation : @xmath141 which leads to @xmath142 we get : @xmath143 @xmath144 in order to find the relations between the coefficients we need that both sides will be expressed in the same fourier harmonics .",
    "therefore , we need to expand : @xmath145 in a fourier series .",
    "the condition for this to be expanded in a fourier series is that @xmath146 is @xmath147 ( i.e. @xmath148 on the segment @xmath149 $ ] ) .",
    "if that is the case , we can expand : @xmath150 actually , it is found to be more convenient to expand powers of @xmath57 in a fourier series : @xmath151 were @xmath152 and @xmath153 on the segment @xmath149 $ ] .",

    "next , we substitute the expansions in the continuity equation for the displacement : @xmath168=\\frac{1}{\\mu_2}[\\kappa_2\\varphi^2(\\omega)-\\frac{\\phi(\\omega)}{\\overline{\\phi'(\\omega)}}\\overline{\\varphi'^2(\\omega)}-\\overline{\\psi^2(\\omega)}]\\nonumber \\ . \\label{bccrack}\\ ] ] substituting : @xmath169=\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath170 \\ .\\ ] ] we can also expand : @xmath171 @xmath172 substituting and changing the indices of summation : @xmath141 which leads to @xmath142 : @xmath173=\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath174 \\ .\\ ] ] expanding @xmath146 as before and defining : @xmath175 we get : @xmath176=\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath177\\zeta^n \\ .\\ ] ] when cutting the infinite series in the same way , we get again a matrix equation ( with the same dimensions ) of the form : @xmath178 combining equations ( [ matform ] ) and ( [ matform2 ] ) we get a @xmath179 matrix equation : @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182    99 n. j. hardiman , quart .",
