    "the discovery of extrasolar planets during the past decade has confronted astronomers with many new challenges .",
    "the diverse and surprising dynamical characteristics of many of these objects have made scientists wonder to what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied to other planetary systems . a major challenge of planetary science is now to explain how such planets were formed , how they acquired their unfamiliar dynamical state , and whether they can be habitable .    among the unfamiliar characteristics of the currently known extrasolar planetary systems , the existence of systems with multiple planets in which jovian - type bodies are in eccentric and close - in orbits , and the existence of jupiter - like planets in multi - star systems are particularly interesting .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , at the present , 26 extrasolar planetary systems contain more than one giant planet .",

    "the formation of terrestrial - class objects in such planetary systems , and the possibility of their long - term stability in the habitable zones of their host stars are strongly affected by the dynamical perturbations of the giant planets and/or the stellar companions .",

    "in order for a planetary system to be habitable , an earth - like planet has to maintain its orbit in the habitable zone ( hz ) of the system s central star for a long time .",
    "this condition requires that the orbital eccentricity of a habitable planet to be close to zero and its interactions with other bodies of the system do not disturb its long - term stability . in a multi - planet system , these conditions may not be easily satisfied .",
    "the dynamics of an object in such systems is strongly affected by other planets and the habitability of a terrestrial planet may be influenced by the perturbations from giant bodies .",
    "the latter is more significant in systems where the orbits of giant planets are close to the habitable zone .",
