    "bl lacertae objects are characterized by an intense and variable non  thermal continuum , that extends from the radio to the gamma  ray band .",
    "this is commonly attributed to synchrotron and inverse compton radiation from a relativistic jet pointing toward the observer ( see @xcite for a review ) . in a @xmath2 representation , their overall spectrum has two broad peaks , one at low energies ( ir  x ) due to synchrotron radiation and one at higher energies ( x@xmath3 ) , plausibly due to inverse compton scattering .",
    "pks 2155304 is one of the brightest bl lacs from the optical to the x  ray band with the synchrotron peak in the uv- soft x ",
    "ray range , corresponding to the definition of high frequency peak bl lac objects ( hbl ) ( @xcite ) , which have the synchrotron peak at the highest frequencies , low luminosity and a small ratio between the @xmath3ray and the synchrotron peak luminosities .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum is flat ( @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 . ] in the 0.1 - 10 gev energy range ) , indicating that the compton peak is beyond @xmath6 gev .",
    "recently it has been detected in the tev band ( chadwick et al .",
    "@xcite ) . due to these characteristics",
    ", pks2155304 has been the target of numerous multiwavelength campaigns ( e.g. edelson et al.@xcite for november 1991 , urry et al .",
    "@xcite for may 1994 ) .",
    "the study of the simultaneous behavior of the source at different frequencies is important in order to understand the emission mechanisms and to constrain the physical properties of the emitting region .    in 1996",
    "june , an intense multiwavelength monitoring was carried out involving optical telescopes , uv , x  ray and @xmath3ray satellites .",
    "thanks to the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , for the first time we had infrared simultaneous observations .",
    "these are the first observations of this object in the mid and far infrared since iras .",
    "pks 2155304 was detected by iras in 1983 at 12 , 25 , 60 microns with a flux of about 100 mjy in all three bands ( impey & neugebauer @xcite ) . in this object",
    "the ir emission is at frequencies lower than the synchrotron peak , and the spectral shape in this band can reveal if there are relevant thermal contributions ( e.g. by the host galaxy or by a dusty torus around the nucleus ) or if the emission can be entirely attributed to synchrotron radiation .    here",
    "we present the iso observations of pks 2155304 , carried out during the campaign in 1996 may ",
    "june , covering a wavelength range from 2.8 to 200 @xmath0 m .",
    "this is complemented by some simultaneous bvr observations from the dutch 0.9 m eso telescope .",
    "results from iso observations of 1996 november and 1997 may are also reported .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a brief description of the iso instruments and of the observations are given in section [ sec : isoobs ] and the results are reported in section [ sec : isoresults ] . in section [ sec : optobs ] we present the optical data and in section [ sec : discussion ] we compare our results with the theoretical models .",
    "pks 2155304 is a weak ir source for iso .",
    "therefore considerable care was taken in data reduction and background subtraction .",
    "details are given in appendix a.",
    "pks 2155304 was observed with iso between 1996 may 7 and june 8 .",
    "two additional observations were performed on 1996 november 23 and 1997 may 15 .    the iso satellite ( @xcite ) is equipped with a 60 cm ritchey  chrtien telescope and has four scientific instruments on board . for the pks",

    "the host galaxy of pks 2155304 is a large elliptical which is well resolved in near infrared images ( @xcite ) , but the pixel field of view of the isocam camera ( 3or 6 ) is too big to resolve it and its contribution is integrated in the flux of the active nucleus .",

    "[ tab : spectrum ] , we see that they are less than 1% of the active nucleus flux , and much less than the uncertainties .",
    "we thus conclude that the contribution of the host galaxy to the iso far  ir flux is negligible .",
    "this fact can be also inferred from the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , built with the simultaneous data of may 1996 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) , that shows that the iso data lie on the interpolation between radio and optical spectra .",
    "the observed ir spectrum is rather flat , and one can wonder if this is due to a partially opaque emission , i.e. if we have , in the ir , the superposition of components with different self  absorption frequencies , as for the flat radio spectra .    to show that this is @xmath62 the case , we calculate the self  absorption frequency assuming that the ir radiation originates in the same compact region responsible for most of the emission , including the strongly variable x  ray flux . this is a conservative assumption , since the more compact is the region , the larger is the self  absorption frequency . in the case of an isotropic population of relativistic electrons with a power  law distribution @xmath63 , the self  absorption frequency is given by ( e.g. krolik 1999 ) @xmath64^{\\frac{2}{p+4 } } , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the gamma function , @xmath66 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath67 is the beaming factor , @xmath68 is the size of the source , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the slope of the electron distribution appropriate for those electrons radiating at the self  absorption energy . in the homogeneous synchrotron self ",
    "compton model , the optical depth @xmath71 is approximately the ratio of the compton and synchrotron flux at the same frequency .",
    "this ratio can be estimated from the sed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) , where the compton flux is obtained by extending at low frequencies the compton spectrum with the same spectral index of the synchrotron curve .",
    "the upper limit for the @xmath3ray emission in 1996 may corresponds to an upper limit for the value of the optical depth of @xmath72 . from the iso spectrum",
    ", we have @xmath73 .",
    "although we can not a priori determine the other two parameters , namely @xmath53 and @xmath67 , a reasonable estimate can be derived through the broad band model fitting . in particular if we adopt the values derived by tavecchio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , @xmath74 g and @xmath75 , we get @xmath76 hz . for less extreme values of @xmath67 , @xmath77 becomes smaller , while much larger values of the magnetic field ( making @xmath77 to increase ) are implausible , if the significant @xmath3ray emission is due to the self  compton process , which requires the source not to be strongly magnetically dominated .",
    "the frequency of self  absorption is thus significantly lower then the ir frequencies , implying that the ir emission is completely thin .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] we show the sed of pks 2155304 during our multiwavelength campaign , from the far ir to the @xmath3ray band .",
    "we also collected other , not simultaneous , data from the literature , especially in the x  ray band , to compare our overall spectrum with previous observations .",
    "as can be seen , our ir data fill a hole in the sed and , together with our optical results , contribute to a precise definition of the shape of the synchrotron peak .",
    "it is remarkable that although the x  ray state during our campaign was very high ( one of the highest ever seen ) , the optical emission was not particularly bright .",
    "also the upper limit in the @xmath3ray band testifies that the source was not bright in this band .",
    "all this can be explained assuming that the x  ray flux is due to the steep tail of an electron population distributed in energy as a broken power law",
    ". the first part of this distribution is flat and steadier than the high energy , steeper part . in this case",
    "_ without changing significantly the bolometric luminosity _ large flux variations are possible above the synchrotron ( and the compton ) peak",
    ". an electron distribution with these characteristics can be obtained by continuous injection and rapid cooling ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , if the electrons are injected at a rate @xmath78 between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the steady particle distribution will be @xmath81 above @xmath79 , and @xmath82 below , until radiation losses dominate the particle escape or other cooling terms ( e.g. adiabatic expansion ) .",
    "electrons with energy @xmath83 are the ones responsible for the emission at the synchrotron and compton peaks ( as long as the scattering process is in the thomson limit ) .",
    "since it is possible to change @xmath84 without changing the total injected power , large flux variations above the peak are compatible with only minor changes below .",
    "this model also predicts that the spectrum below the peak has a slope @xmath85 , which is not far from what we have observed in the far ir .",

    "the impact of charged particles ( glitches ) on the detectors create spikes in the pixel signal curve . to remove these spurious signals , we first used the multiresolution median transform method ( @xcite ) , then every frame was inspected to make sure that the number of suppressed noise signals was negligible and finally a manual deglitching operation was done to detect the glitches left and flag them .",
    "some glitches caused a change in the pixel sensitivity : in this case we flagged the pixel in all readouts after the glitch .",
    "the library dark images were not good enough to remove all the effects of the dark current : the signals in rows and columns showed a saw  teeth structure , that was eliminated using the fast fourier transform technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "the response of the detector pixels to a change in the incident flux is not immediate and the signal reaches the stabilization after some time .",
    "this time interval depends on the initial and final flux values and on the number of readouts ( @xcite ) . therefore , the time sequence of a pixel signal shows , after a change in the incident flux , an upward or downward transient behaviour . at the beginning of every observation , after a certain number of frames , the signal should reach the stable value . as this ideal situation could not always been achieved , cia provides different routines to overcome this problem and apply the transient correction .",
    "these routines use different models to fit the signal curves , in order to identify the stable value .    in the sw5 observations , the photons coming from pks 2155304 fell mainly in one or two pixels , whose signals showed an upward transient behaviour that never reached the stabilization . on the contrary , the background , being very low ,",
    "was stabilized .",
    "no transient correction routines were able to adequately fit the source signals , either underestimating or overestimating the stable flux . observing the signal curves , we noticed that the behaviour of the first part of the curves were far from the expected converging trends that are used in the models of the correction routines , while the remaining part of the curves seemed to be well described by a converging exponential trend .",
    "so , after having discarded the starting readouts , we fitted the signal with a simple exponential model @xmath86 , where the optimized parameters are @xmath87 , @xmath71 and @xmath88 , that represents the stable signal .",
    "we chose the fit which showed a reasonable result and optimized the determination coefficient @xmath89 , where @xmath90 are the measured signals and @xmath91 is the mean of the part we considered . in three cases ,",
    "the results were not acceptable and we could define only lower limits , as the upward transients had not reached the stabilization .",
    "for the transient correction of the lw3 observations , the model developed at the _",
    "institut dastrophysique spatiale _ ( ias model ) ( @xcite ) has been used . as the corrected curves attained stable values in the second half only",
    ", we did not use the first half of the frames .    in the spectral observation of may 27 , the uninterrupted sequence of filters used created either upward or downward transients and the stabilization of the source signal",
    "was reached just in few cases .",
    "the five observations made with the sw channel were corrected using the same method as the sw5 ones , except for the sw11 filter , in which the stabilization was reached for all pixels . in this case",
    ", we just discarded the first half of the 162 frames . in the sw2 filter data , at the end of the observation , the source signal was so far from stabilization that we could define only a lower limit .",
    "the five observations made with the lw channel were corrected using the ias model . as this model takes into account all the past illumination history",
    ", we fitted a unique curve that was built linking together all the lw filters data .",
    "this method worked fine for two filters only ( lw8 and lw9 ) , while for the other three filters again we defined lower limits .",
    "the total signal of the source was computed integrating the values of the signal in a box centered on the source and subtracting the normalized background obtained in a ring of 1 pixel width around the box .",
    "the boxes had dimension ranging from 3x3 to 7x7 pixels , depending on the filter and on the pixel field of view ( pfov ) .",
    "the results were colour corrected and divided for the point spread function ( psf ) fraction falling in the box .",
    "this fraction also depends on filters and pfov . to compute it , we extracted from the library , for each combination of filter and pfov , the nine psf images centered more or less on the same pixels of pks 2155304 . for calibration requirements , in each psf image the centroid of the source was placed in a slightly different position inside the same pixel . as we do not know with enough accuracy the position of the centroid of pks 2155304 in the isocam images ,",
    "the nine psf were averaged and the result was normalized .",
    "the psf correction was calculated by summing the signal of the pixels in a box of the same dimension of that in which we extracted the source signal . for the lw detector",
    ", a further correction factor was applied to take into account the flux of the point  like source that falls outside the detector ( @xcite ) . for the sw channel",
    ", we adopted for all filters the sw5 psf , because , along with sw1 , was the only one present in the calibration library , however the error we introduced can only be of a few percent .      to compute the photometric error we divided the uncertainty sources in two parts : the first one took into account the dark current subtraction , deglitching , flat fielding operations and signal to flux conversion , while the second one considered the transient correction .",
    "the first group of error sources are derived from the automatic analysis results ( aar ; olp v7.0 for the light curves data , olp v6.3.2 for the spectrum data ) .",
    "the source flux values @xmath92 given by the aar are not reliable because the transient correction is not performed , but the aar absolute flux errors @xmath93 are a good estimate of the first group of errors ( the aar fluxes are given in tabs .",
    "[ tab : lcisocam ] and [ tab : spectrum ] ) .",
    "we assumed that the fluxes @xmath94 that we derived have the same relative error @xmath95 .",
    "thus , for our fluxes this part of error is @xmath96 , which accounts for all the uncertainties sources , but the transient correction .",
    "we estimated that the error due to the transient correction is of the order of 10% , which is the rounded maximum error on the stable signal @xmath88 , obtaining a total error of @xmath97 .",
    "we assumed then a @xmath98 of 10% for all our measurements ( 20% for sw4 and sw10 filters ) .",
    "the observations were done in rectangular chopped mode : the observed field of view switches alternately between the source and an 180distant off  source position .",
    "this is necessary in order to measure the background level .",
    "the chopping direction was along the satellite z - axis , which was slowly rotating by about one degree per day .",
    "thus , every time the background was sampled in different fields of the sky and a raster map was performed just to check the stability of the background all around the source .",
    "the standard deviation of the background flux measured in the central pixel of the c100 detector , in the eight off - source positions of the scan , is 37 mjy .",
    "this value is much less than the error of the source flux ( see tab . [ tab : lcisophot ] ) .",
    "this small background fluctuation would lead to a rise of the scatter of the source flux , in any case our results are compatible with absence of variability ( see section [ sec : isoresults ] ) .",
    "each observation of an astronomical target was immediately followed by a fine calibration source ( fcs ) measurement , using internal calibrations sources .",
    "these measurements were made in order to determine the detector responsitivity , which is necessary to compute the target flux .",
    "pia separates the operations to be performed on the data in different levels : at each level pia creates a data structure on which it operates .",
    "this data structure takes its name according to the properties of the data .",
    "the first part of the data analysis was common for all the observations , then the procedures changed according to the different characteristics of the observation ( whether it was chopped or not or whether the detector was receiving photons from the astronomical target or from the fcs ) .    at the beginning ,",
    "pia automatically converted the digital data from telemetry in meaningful physical units and created the structure of data , called edited raw data ( erd ) . at the erd level , some starting readouts and the last readout of each ramp were discarded , because they are disturbed by the voltage resetting ; we also manually discarded the part of the ramp before or after a glitch ( that causes a sudden jump of the readout value ) in the cases where most part of the ramp was unchanged and the glitch did not modify the detector responsitivity . a correction for the non  linear responsitivity of the detector",
    "was applied , using special calibration files .",
    "then , each ramp was fitted by a 1st order polynomial model . a signal ( in v s@xmath99 )",
    "was obtained from the slope of every ramp : the slope is proportional to the incident power . at signal per ramp data ( srd ) level ,",
    "the first half of the signals per chopper plateau were discarded , because of stabilization problems . as the signal value depends on the integration time ,",
    "a correction factor was applied and the signal was normalized for an integration time of 1/4 s. the dark current was subtracted using the pia calibration files , which take into account the satellite position in the orbit .",
    "an algorithm was applied to discover and discard the signals that were anomalously high , because of glitches ; then , the signals of each chopper plateau were averaged . at signal per chopper plateau",
    "( scp ) level , the responsitivity of each detector pixel was computed taking the median of the fcs2 signals of the calibration measurements ; then , the vignetting correction was performed on the target observations . in the chopped measurements ,",
    "the background , that was calculated at the off  source position , was subtracted to get the source signal .    as for the camera",
    ", the response of the photometer detectors has some delays after a change in the incident flux .",
    "this effect causes losses in the signal values measured in the chopped measurements , so a correction factor was applied .",
    "the signal was finally converted into power , using the responsitivity obtained from the fcs measurement .    in the observations performed with the 3x3 pixel c100 detector ,",
    "only the central pixel was used to compute the source flux density , because , as the most of the airy disk of a point - like source centered in the pixel lies in the same pixel ( 69% for c1_60 and 61% for c1_90 ) , to use the outer pixels just adds more noise than signal .",
    "the source flux density is defined as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the incident power , @xmath102 is a conversion factor of each filter ( as given in the pia calibration file pfluxconv.fits ) and @xmath103 is the fraction of psf that falls on the pixel considered when the source is located in the centre ( @xcite , tabs . 2 and 4 ) .",
    "the absolute photometric error was computed by pia , during the data reduction process , and took into account the uncertainty in the determination of the slope of the ramp and the errors associated to the other performed correction operations .",
