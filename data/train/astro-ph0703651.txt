    "the first indication of the existence of dark matter has already been found in the 1930s @xcite .",
    "by now astrophysicists have strong evidence @xcite-@xcite to believe that a large fraction ( more than 80% ) of the matter in the universe is dark ( i.e. , interacts at most very weakly with electromagnetic radiation ) .",
    "the dominant component of this cosmological dark matter must be due to some yet to be discovered , non  baryonic particles . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xmath0 are one of the leading candidates for dark matter .",
    "wimps are stable particles which arise in several extensions of the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "typically they are presumed to have masses between 10 gev and a few tev and interact with ordinary matter only weakly ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .    currently , the most promising method to detect many different wimp candidates is the direct detection of the recoil energy deposited in a low  background laboratory detector by elastic scattering of ambient wimps on the nuclei in a detector @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the event rate of direct wimp detection depends strongly on the velocity distribution of the incident particles . usually and for simplicity",
    ", the local velocity distribution of wimps is assumed to be a shifted maxwell distribution , as would arise if the milky way halo is isothermal @xcite-@xcite . however , our halo is certainly not a precisely isothermal sphere .",
    "possibilities that have been considered in the literature include axisymmetric halo models @xcite , the so  called secondary infall model of halo formation @xcite , and a possible bulk rotations of the halo of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "if the halo of our galaxy consists of wimps , about @xmath1 wimps should pass through every square centimeter of the earth s ( and our ! ) surface per second ( for @xmath2 ) . however , the cross section of wimps on ordinary materials is very low and makes these interactions quite rare @xcite .",
    "for example , in typical susy models with neutralino wimp , the event rate is about @xmath3 event / kg / day and the energy deposited in the detector by a single interaction is about @xmath4 kev .",
    "typical event rates due to cosmic rays and ambient radioactivity are much larger .",
    "the annual modulation of the event rate due to the orbital motion of the earth around the sun has been suggested as a way to discriminate signal from background @xcite .",
    "actually , the dama collaboration has claimed that they have observed this annual modulation of the event rate @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the annual modulation of the signal is expected to amount only to a few percent ; this method can therefore only be used once more than one hundred signal events have been accumulated . in the meantime , a more promising approach is to reduce the background by vetoing events that do not look like nuclear recoil .",
    "this method is , e.g. , being used by the cdms @xcite , cresst @xcite and edelweiss @xcite collaborations .",
    "the presently best null result , from cdms @xcite , contradicts the dama claim for standard halo models .",
    "gev , and fast wimps with large scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "another possible way out is to postulate that the detected events are actually inelastic , leading to the production of a second particle that is almost , but not exactly , degenerate with the wimp @xcite . ]",
    "so far most theoretical analyses of direct wimp detection have predicted the detection rate for a given ( class of ) wimp(s ) , based on a specific model of the galactic halo .",
    "the goal of this paper is to invert this process .",
    "that is , we wish to study , as model  independently as possible , what future direct detection experiments can teach us about the wimp halo . in other words",
    ", we want to start the ( theoretical ) exploration of `` wimp astronomy '' . in this first study",
    "we use a time  averaged recoil spectrum , and assume that no directional information exists .",
    "we can thus only hope to construct the ( time - averaged ) one  dimensional velocity distribution @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the absolute value of the wimp velocity in the earth rest frame .",
    "note that our ansatz is quite different from that of the recent paper @xcite , which assumes a wimp velocity distribution and then analyses with which precision the wimp mass can be determined from the direct detection experiment .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we show how to find the velocity distribution of wimps from the functional form of the recoil spectrum ; our assumption here is that this functional form has been determined by fitting the data of some ( future ) experiment(s ) .",
    "we then derive formulae for moments of the velocity distribution function , such as the mean velocity and the velocity dispersion of wimps , which can be compared with model predictions .",
    "we also discuss some simple halo models . in sec .",
    "3 we will develop a method that allows to reconstruct the wimp velocity distribution function directly from recorded signal events .",
    "this allows statistically meaningful tests of predicted distribution functions .",
    "we will also show how to calculate the moments of the velocity distribution directly from these data . in sec .",
    "4 we conclude our work and discuss some further projects . some technical details of our calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "in this section we first show how to reconstruct ( moments of ) the wimp velocity distribution , and then discuss some simple model distributions .",
    "the differential rate for elastic wimp  nucleus scattering is given by @xcite : [ eqn201 ] = dv . here",
    "@xmath7 is the direct detection event rate , i.e. , the number of events per unit time and unit mass of detector material , @xmath8 is the energy deposited in the detector , @xmath9 is the elastic nuclear form factor , and @xmath5 is the one  dimensional velocity distribution function of the wimps impinging on the detector .",

    "they reproduced the normalized velocity distribution functions in eqs.([eqn221 ] ) and ( [ eqn222 ] ) , as well as the results in eqs.([eqn226a ] ) to ( [ eqn227b ] ) .",
    "in the previous section we have derived formulae for the normalized one  dimensional velocity distribution function of wimps , @xmath5 , and for its moments @xmath42 , from the recoil  energy spectrum , @xmath17 . in order to use these expressions",
    ", one would need a functional form for @xmath17 . in practice",

    "this will complicate the error analysis considerably , if @xmath17 is the result of a fit .    in this section",
    "we therefore go one step further , and derive expressions that allow to reconstruct @xmath5 and its moments _ directly from the data_. the assumption we have to make is that the sample to be analyzed only contains signal events , i.e. , is free of background .",

    "the remaining background is dominated by elastic scattering of fast neutrons . while these look just like signal events , this background can  at least in principle ",
    "be made arbitrarily small by careful shielding and the use of a muon veto system ( to veto cosmic ray induced neutrons ) . having a sample of pure signal events , we can proceed with a complete statistical analysis of the precision with which we can reconstruct @xmath5 and its moments .    in the absence of a true experimental sample of this kind",
    ", we had to resort to monte carlo experiments .",
    "to that end we wrote an unweighted event generator .",
    "to do so , we had to specify the form factor @xmath9 appearing in eq.([eqn201 ] ) ; this is the topic of the first subsection .",
    "we then proceed to analyze the reconstruction of @xmath5 and its moments in two subsequent subsections .",
    "we start by presenting the two most commonly used parameterizations of the squared nuclear form factor @xmath45 appearing in eq.([eqn201 ] ) .",
    "we focus on spin  independent scattering , which usually dominates the event rate ; moreover , spin  dependent form factors are still only poorly understood .",
    "the simplest form factor is the exponential one , first introduced by ahlen _",
    "_ @xcite and freese _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite : [ eqn301]f_ex^2(q ) = e^-q / q_0 , where @xmath8 is the recoil energy transferred from the incident wimp to the target nucleus , q_0 = is the nuclear coherence energy and r_0 =  fm is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "the exponential form factor implies that the radial density profile of the nucleus has a gaussian form .",
    "this gaussian density profile is simple , but not very realistic .",
    "engel has therefore suggested a more accurate form factor @xcite , inspired by the woods ",
    "saxon nuclear density profile , [ eqn302]f_ws^2(q ) = ^2 e^-(q s)^2 .",
    "here @xmath46 is a spherical bessel function , q = is the transferred 3momentum , and r_1 = with r_a 1.2 ~ a^1/3  fm ,   s 1  fm . in our simulation",
    "we used the more accurate woods ",
    "saxon form factor in eq.([eqn302 ] ) .",
    "since we assume a detector without directional sensitivity , a single event is uniquely characterized by the measured recoil energy @xmath8 .",
    "existing experiments such as cresst @xcite and cdms @xcite can determine the recoil energy quite accurately .",
    "we will see shortly that the statistical errors on the reconstructed velocity distribution @xmath5 will be quite sizable even for next  generation experiments , given existing bounds on the scattering rate .",
    "we can therefore to good approximation ignore the error of @xmath8 in our analysis .    in the following",
    "we do not distinguish between the recoil spectrum @xmath17 and the actual differential counting rate @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath17 is usually given per unit detector weight and unit time , the two quantities differ by a multiplicative constant .",
    "this constant cancels in eq.([eqn212 ] ) , since it will also appear in the normalization constant ( [ eqn213 ] ) .",
    "we divide the total energy range into @xmath48 bins with central points @xmath49 and widths @xmath50 . in each bin",
    ", @xmath51 events will be recorded .",
    "our simulated data set can therefore be described by [ e3_0 ] q_n- ,   i = 1 ,  2 ,  ,  n_n ,   n = 1 ,  2 ,  ,  b. the standard estimate for @xmath17 at @xmath52 is then and for the ideal recoil spectrum . ]",

    "a rather crude estimator of this slope is [ e3_3 ] s_1,n _ q = q_n = , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the numbers of events in bin @xmath55 which have measured recoil energy @xmath8 larger and smaller than @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "this estimator is rather crude , since it only uses the information in which half of its bin a given event falls .",
    "it is clear intuitively that an estimator that makes use of the exact @xmath56value of each event should be better .",
    "this can e.g. be obtained from the average @xmath56value in a given bin , defined as [ e3_4 ] q_n = _",
    "i=1^n_n q_n , i .",
    "expanding @xmath57 around @xmath58 , keeping terms up to linear order , gives [ e3_5 ] _ q q_n _ q = q_n + ( q - q_n ) = r_n + ( q - q_n ) s_n .",
    "eq.([e3_5 ] ) allows to calculate @xmath59 as expectation value of @xmath8 in the @xmath60th bin : [ e3_6 ] q_n - q_n = = .",
    "an improved estimator of the slope is thus [ e3_7 ] s_2,n = .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the estimator ( [ e3_7 ] ) indeed has a smaller statistical error than the one in eq.([e3_3 ] ) .",

    "this is smaller than the error ( [ e3_8 ] ) , by a factor 3/4 .",
    "an important observation is that the statistical error of both estimators of the slope of the recoil spectrum scale like the bin width to the power @xmath62 .",
    "this can intuitively be understood from the argument that the variation of @xmath17 , which we are trying to determine , will be larger for larger bins .",
    "one would therefore naively conclude that the errors of the estimated slopes would be minimized by choosing very large bins .",
    "however , both eq.([e3_3 ] ) and eq.([e3_7 ] ) reproduce the actual slope at @xmath58 only if the taylor expansion ( [ e3_5 ] ) holds ; in the presence of higher powers of @xmath63 neither of these estimates exactly reproduces the true slope at @xmath58 .",
    "not surprisingly , the influence of these higher powers , which induce uncontrolled systematic errors , will _ increase _ quickly with increasing bin width @xmath64 .",
    "we had seen at the end of sec .  2 that the predicted recoil spectrum resembles a falling exponential .",

    "this figure also shows the result of a simulated experiment , where the exposure time and cross section are chosen such that the expected number of events is 5,000 ; these have been collected in seven bins in recoil energy .    while an approximately exponential function can be approximated by a linear ansatz , as in eq.([e3_5 ] ) , only over a narrow range of @xmath8 , i.e. , for small bin widths , the _ logarithm _ of this function can be approximated by a linear ansatz for much wider bins .",

    "however , one may hope that the expectation value of our estimator still reproduces the true logarithmic slope at _ some _ value of @xmath8 within the @xmath60th bin .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig303 ] , which shows various evaluations of the logarithmic slope within one bin as function of the quadratic coefficient @xmath89 .",
    "the true logarithmic slope at the center of the bin is , of course , still given by @xmath90 , independent of the correction @xmath89 . as argued above",
    ", the expectation value of our estimator , shown by the dashed ( red ) line , does depend on @xmath89 .",
    "note , however , that our estimator comes quite close to the true logarithmic slope at the shifted value @xmath91 defined in eq.([e3_12 ] ) , which is shown by the dot  dashed ( blue ) line ; this is true for both signs of @xmath89 .",
    "we therefore conclude that we can minimize the leading systematic error by interpreting our estimator of @xmath69 as logarithmic slope of the recoil spectrum , not at the center of the bin @xmath49 , but at the shifted point @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath72 itself depends on @xmath69 ; this , however , does not introduce any additional error , if we simply interpret eq.([e3_12 ] ) as an  admittedly somewhat complicated  prescription for the determination of the @xmath56values where we wish to estimate the logarithmic slope of the recoil spectrum .    using large bins",
    "has a second , obvious disadvantage : the number of bins scales inversely with their size , i.e. , by using large bins we d be able to estimate @xmath21 only at a small number of velocities .",
    "this can be alleviated by using overlapping bins , or ",
    "equivalently  by combining several relatively small bins into overlapping `` windows '' .",
    "this means that a given data point @xmath92 may well contribute to several different windows , and hence to the measurement of @xmath21 at several values of @xmath6 .",
    "this can increase the total amount of information about @xmath21 since the only information we use about the data points in a given window is encoded in the average recoil energy in this window .",
    "this averaging effectively destroys information . by letting a given data point",
    "contribute to several overlapping windows , this loss of information can be reduced .",
    "a final disadvantage of using large bins or windows is that it would lead to a quite large minimal value of @xmath6 where @xmath21 can be reconstructed , simply because the central value @xmath93 , and also the shifted point @xmath94 , of a large first bin would be quite large .",
    "this can be again be alleviated by first collecting our data in relatively small bins , and then combining varying numbers of bins into overlapping windows . in particular , the first window would be identical with the first bin .",
    "a final consideration concerns the size of the bins . choosing fixed bin sizes , and",
    "therefore also mostly fixed window sizes , would lead to errors on the estimated logarithmic slopes , and hence also on the estimates of @xmath21 , that increase quickly with increasing @xmath8 or @xmath6 .",
    "this is due to the essentially exponential form of the recoil spectrum , which would lead to a quickly falling number of events in equal  sized bins .",
    "we found that we get roughly equal errors in all bins if we instead take linearly increasing bins .",
    "these considerations motivate the following set  up for our mock experimental analysis .",
    "we start by binning the data , as in eq.([e3_0 ] ) , where the bin widths satisfy [ e3_16 ] b_n = b_1 + ( n-1 ) ; here the increment @xmath95 satisfies [ e3_17 ] = , @xmath48 being the total number of bins , and @xmath96 being the ( kinematical or instrumental ) extrema of the recoil energy .",
    "we then collect up to @xmath97 bins into a window , with smaller windows at the borders of the range of @xmath8 . in the following we use latin indices @xmath98",
    "to label bins , and greek indices @xmath99 to label windows ; later on we will use latin indices @xmath100 to label all events in the sample .",
    "for @xmath101 the @xmath102th window simply consists of the first @xmath103 bins ; for @xmath104 , the @xmath102th window consists of bins @xmath105 ; and for @xmath106 , the @xmath102th window consists of last @xmath107 bins .",
    "this can also be described by introducing the indices @xmath108 and @xmath109 which label the first and last bin contributing to the @xmath102th window , with [ e3_18 ] i_- = \\ {    ll 1 , & n_w + - n_w + 1 , & n_w    .",

    "the total number of windows defined through eq.([e3_18 ] ) is evidently @xmath112 .",
    "the basic observables needed for the reconstruction of @xmath21 are then the number of events @xmath113 in the @xmath110th bin , as well as the average @xmath114 defined as in eq.([e3_4 ] ) . from these",
    "one easily calculates the number of events per window , [ e3_19 ] n_= _ i = i_-^i_+ n_i as well as the averages [ e3_20 ] q_= _ i = i_-^i_+ n_i q_i .",
    "one drawback of the use of overlapping windows in the analysis is that the observables defined in eqs.([e3_19 ] ) and ( [ e3_20 ] ) are all correlated ( for @xmath115 ) .",
    "the slope in a given window will again be calculated as in eq.([eqn314 ] ) , with `` bin '' quantities replaced by `` window '' quantities .",

    "moreover , the number of bins has been fixed a priori in these analyses .",
    "the last bin is typically empty , and has therefore been ignored in the analysis .",

    "+    the two histograms in each figure differ by the number of terms that have been included in the estimate of the covariance matrix for @xmath138 .",
    "the solid ( blue ) histograms have been obtained by only including the second term in eq.([e3_30 ] ) , while the dashed ( red ) histograms also include the other terms , which are due to the statistical errors on the rescaled event numbers @xmath136 .",
    "we note that including these terms on average leads to a slight overestimate of the true error of @xmath138 , i.e. , the average of @xmath140 is somewhat smaller than unity .",

    "the lower figure demonstrates that for an average of 5,000 events per experiment the distribution of @xmath140 values becomes quite similar to the well  known @xmath141 distribution , shown by the smooth curve .",
    "at least two effects contribute to the difference .",
    "first , we heavily relied on gaussian error propagation in our estimate ( [ e3_30 ] ) of the covariance matrix of the reconstructed velocity distribution .",
    "this is essentially a taylor expansion , including only the first non  trivial term .",
    "it therefore becomes exact only in the limit of small errors , i.e. , for large numbers of events in a given window .",
    "since the recoil spectrum is falling essentially exponentially , this condition is practically always violated at least in the last bin(s ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig301 ] .",
    "we discard windows containing less than 3 events , but it is clear that this at best alleviates the problem . in the case at hand , this evidently results in an overestimate of the true error . secondly , our estimator ( [ e3_27 ] ) for the velocity distribution relies on the estimate of the logarithmic slopes @xmath128 , which in turn is based on eq.([eqn314 ] ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig303 ] this estimate of @xmath128 in general has some systematic error , which would tend to increase @xmath140 .",
    "however , this figure also led us to expect small systematic errors if @xmath128 is interpreted as estimator of the logarithmic slope at the shifted points @xmath132 . indeed , as stated above , the total expression ( [ e3_30 ] )",
    "somewhat overestimates the true error even in the lower frame of figs .",
    "[ fig304 ] , which assumes a large number of events but uses a rather small number of bins , which thus have to be quite large . had we instead interpreted @xmath128 as estimator of the slope at @xmath117 , the average @xmath140 would be about 2.9 , indicating that the systematic error would have dominated .",
    "[ fig304 ] also show an excess of simulated experiments with rather large values of @xmath140 if the covariance matrix for @xmath138 is estimated based on the errors on the @xmath128 only .",
    "this is true also for the upper frame , even though in this case the average value of @xmath140 is only about 0.93 . to be conservative , from now on",
    "we therefore take the full eq.([e3_30 ] ) as our estimator of the covariance matrix of @xmath138 , leading to average @xmath145 for the upper ( lower ) frame of figs .",

    "nevertheless @xmath155 can be regarded as a measure of the information content of a set of reconstructed @xmath159 ; in the absence of correlations , it becomes the sum over the inverse squares of the _ relative _ errors .",
    "note that , in contrast to @xmath140 , @xmath155 does not have a @xmath160 factor in front ; after all , by adding more windows we also add more values @xmath134 at which @xmath21 is determined , which can increase the information content .",
    "the first four rows , as well as the last four rows , show the effect of varying @xmath97 , the maximal number of bins that are collected in a window .",
    "we see that there is an optimal choice for this quantity .",
    "reducing @xmath97 leads to loss of information , as indicated by greatly increased values for the probability that @xmath138 is compatible with @xmath21 being constant as well as reduced values of @xmath155 . on the other hand , making the windows too large introduces too large systematic uncertainties in the estimates of the logarithmic slopes @xmath128 , which in turn leads to too large average values of @xmath140 .",
    "this is illustrated by rows four and seven , which have large windows due to our choice of a large @xmath97 ( row 4 ) or a large @xmath161 ( row 7 ) .",
    "the table also shows that the choice of @xmath161 has some impact on the confidence level with which the hypothesis of a constant @xmath21 can be rejected .",

    "in fact , for 500 events and @xmath163 one can formally maximize the confidence level with which a constant @xmath21 can be rejected by considering only two bins , and making the first bin very large ; this is shown in the fifth row .",
    "note that this leads to an average @xmath140 well below unity , indicating that in spite of the large bins , systematic errors are still insignificant .",
    "however , we note that in this case our assumption that the error on @xmath133 is negligible is clearly not justified , since @xmath133 receives almost its entire contribution from the large first bin . by including the error on @xmath164 but ignoring the ( strongly correlated ! ) error on @xmath133 we clearly over ",
    "estimate the total statistical error in this case .",
    "recall also that a large first bin leads to a large value for the smallest velocity , @xmath165 , where @xmath21 is determined .",
    "our `` figure of merit '' @xmath155 is less dependent on the details of binning , although , as stated earlier , it does strongly benefit from combining several bins into windows .",
    "we also note that the optimal achievable @xmath155 is essentially proportional to the number of events in the sample .",
    "this is expected , since @xmath155 is something like an inverse squared relative error .",
    "we saw in the previous subsection that a direct reconstruction of the wimp velocity distribution @xmath21 will only be possible once several hundred elastic nuclear recoil events have been collected .",
    "this is a tall order , given that not a single such event has so far been detected ( barring the possible dama observation ) .",
    "the basic reason for the large required event sample is that , @xmath21 being a normalized distribution , only information on the _ shape _ of @xmath21 is meaningful . in order to obtain such shape information via direct reconstruction",
    ", we have to separate the events into several bins or windows .",
    "moreover , each window should contain sufficiently many events to allow an estimate of the _ slope _ of the recoil spectrum in this window .    on the other hand , at the end of sec .",
    "2 we also gave expressions for the _ moments _ of @xmath21 . with the exception of the moment with @xmath166 , these are entirely inclusive quantities , i.e. , each moment is sensitive to the entire data set ; no binning is required , nor do we need to determine any slope ( with one possible minor exception ; see below ) .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to expect that one can obtain meaningful information about these moments with fewer events .",
    "an independent motivation for the determination of these moments is that they are sensitive also to @xmath21 at large values of the wimp velocity @xmath6 .",
    "we saw above that direct reconstruction of @xmath21 at large @xmath6 is very difficult , due to the small number of events expected in this region .",
    "moreover , a delta  function  like contribution to @xmath21 at the highest velocity , @xmath167 is very difficult to detect using direct reconstruction ; such a contribution is expected in `` late infall '' models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "the experimental implementation of eq.([eqn215 ] ) is quite straightforward . for @xmath168 ,",
    "the normalization @xmath133 has already been given in eq.([e3_29 ] ) .",
    "the case of non  vanishing threshold energy @xmath24 can be treated straightforwardly , using eq.([en4 ] ) . to that end",
    "we need to estimate the recoil spectrum at the threshold energy .",
    "one possibility would be to choose an artificially high value of @xmath24 , and simply count the events in a bin centered on @xmath24 .",

    "we therefore prefer to keep @xmath24 as small as experimentally possible , and to estimate the counting rate at threshold using the ansatz ( [ eqn311 ] ) .",
    "since we need the recoil spectrum only at this single point , we only have to determine the quantities @xmath164 and @xmath170 parameterizing @xmath17 in the first bin ; this can be done as described in the previous subsection , without the need to distinguish between bins and `` windows '' . introducing the shorthand notation [ e3_32a ] r_thre _ q = q_thre",
    ", the resulting error can be written as [ e3_33 ] ^2 ( r_thre ) = r_thre^2 .",
    "the squared errors for @xmath164 and @xmath170 are simply the corresponding diagonal entries of the respective covariance matrices given in eqs.([e3_23 ] ) and ( [ e3_26 ] ) .",
    "finally , the definition ( [ e3_12 ] ) of @xmath94 implies [ e3_34 ] q_s,1 + k_1 = q_1 - + x_1 , where @xmath171 as before and @xmath93 is the central @xmath56value in the first bin .",
    "it should be noted that the first term in eq.([eqn215 ] ) is negligible for all @xmath172 if @xmath173 kev ; however , even for this low threshold energy it contributes significantly to the normalization constant @xmath133 , as described by eq.([en4 ] ) .",
    "of course , the first term in eq.([eqn215 ] ) always dominates for @xmath174 .",
    "this is not surprising , since the very starting point of our analysis , eq.(1 ) , already shows that the counting rate at @xmath24 is proportional to the `` minus first '' moment of the velocity distribution .",
    "the integral appearing in eq.([eqn215 ] ) can be estimated through the sum [ e3_35 ] i_n = _ a , see eq.([e3_29 ] ) .",
    "since all @xmath175 are determined from the same data , they are correlated , with [ e3_36 ] cov(i_n , i_m ) = _ a .",
    "this can e.g. be seen by writing eq.([e3_35 ] ) as a sum over narrow bins , such that the recoil spectrum within each bin can be approximated by a constant .",
    "each term in the sum would then have to be multiplied with the number of events in this bin ; eq.([e3_36 ] ) then follows from standard error propagation .",
    "note that , when re  converted into an integral , the expression for @xmath176 will diverge logarithmically for @xmath31 ; equivalently , the numerical estimate of this entry can become very large if the sample contains events with very small @xmath56values .",

    "even worse , this region only contributes about 35% to @xmath198 and 5% to @xmath199 !",
    "this implies that an experiment collecting only a small number of events will typically underestimate @xmath187 and , especially , its error ; the problem will become worse with increasing @xmath55 . on the other hand , as mentioned above , when averaged over sufficiently many experiments , our estimates for the @xmath175 do reproduce the true ( input ) values .",

    "our numerical analysis also shows that , after averaging over ( very ) many experiments , eq.([e3_36 ] ) reproduces the mean square deviation between our estimated @xmath175 and the true ( input ) value .",
    "nevertheless , we just saw that in most cases this error is being underestimated . in order to be conservative , we therefore added `` the error on the error '' to the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix ; the off  diagonal entries are then scaled up such that the correlation matrix remains unaltered .",
    "the squared `` error on the error '' is defined as [ e3_46 ] ^2(cov(i_n , i_n ) ) = _ a . with this modification",
    ", the average @xmath141 , again averaged over many experiments , is in the vicinity of unity at least for the first few moments . ,",
    "where @xmath200 are the values of our estimators based on eq.([e3_35 ] ) and @xmath175 are the true ( input ) values , in general does not imply that @xmath201 . adding the `` error of the error '' to the covariance matrix brings the average of this ratio closer to unity . ]",
    "another problem is that the errors of the @xmath175 are very highly correlated .",
    "this can also be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig307 ] : a single event at high @xmath8 will contribute greatly to all moments with sufficiently large @xmath55 .",
    "numerically we find correlations of more than 98% between @xmath202 and @xmath203 for all @xmath204 ; the correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath205 still amounts to more than 87% .",
    "this implies that the higher moments unfortunately add only little to the available information .",
    "worse , attempting to include high moments in a @xmath141 fit often leads to numerical instabilities ; recall that a covariance matrix containing 100% correlated entries become singular , i.e. , can no longer be inverted . in practice",
    "only the moments with @xmath206 therefore seem to be useful .",
    "we are now ready to present some representative numerical results .",
    "[ fig308 ] shows the first 10 moments reconstructed with 100 events , using our standard input parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig301 ] ) .",
    "the estimated values of the moments have been divided by the true values .",
    "we see that in this `` typical '' example the high moments are indeed underestimated .",
    "we also see that the estimated relative errors at first increase with increasing @xmath55 ; this reproduces correctly the trend of the actual deviation of the estimated moments from the exact values .",
    "however , even after adding `` the error on the error '' , we find that the relative errors start to decline again for @xmath207 .",
    "this effect is probably entirely spurious ; recall that the errors are likely to be even more underestimated than the moments themselves .",
    "nevertheless we find it encouraging that already with 100 events a couple of moments can be determined with errors of about 15% .",
    "[ fig309 ] show a example of the information that might be gleaned from analyses of reconstructed moments of the wimp velocity distribution . here",
    "we attempt to constrain a possible `` late infall '' component in @xmath21 @xcite , defined by the ansatz [ e3_47 ] f_1(v ; v_esc , n_l ) = n_s f_1,(v ) ( v_esc - v ) + n_l ( v - v_esc ) . here",
    "@xmath208 is the standard `` shifted gaussian '' distribution ( [ eqn222 ] ) .",
    "as before , we have multiplied it with a cut  off at @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , we introduce a contribution of wimps with fixed velocity , which we set equal to @xmath66 ; these wimps are just falling into our galaxy .",
    "is significantly larger than @xmath209 , this smearing should not matter very much .",

    "@xmath210 and @xmath66 are our free parameters ; @xmath211 is then chosen such that the total @xmath21 is normalized to unity . we then plot contours of @xmath212 , defined as the deviation of @xmath141 from its minimal value , where @xmath141 is defined as [ e3_48 ] ^2 = _ m , n _ mn ; here @xmath213 are the reconstructed moments in our mock experiment , @xmath214 are the predictions for these quantities based on eq.([e3_47 ] ) , and @xmath215 is the inverse of the covariance matrix ( [ e3_41 ] ) .    figs .",
    "[ fig309 ] show a strong degeneracy in the fit .",
    "if the galactic escape velocity @xmath66 is kept fixed at its input value of 700 km / s , a quite significant upper bound on the normalization @xmath210 of the late infall component could be derived already from our simulated experiment with 25 events . however ,",
    "if @xmath66 is kept free , no significant upper bound can be derived even from the simulated experiment with 100 events .",
    "note that the two experiments have been simulated independently , i.e. , the 25 events used for the analysis in the upper frame are not part of the 100 events used in the lower frame .",
    "the simulated experiment with 100 events was a bit `` unlucky '' in that the input values lie just outside the @xmath216 contour .",
    "as a result , the upper bound on @xmath210 for fixed @xmath217 km / s actually comes out a little worse in this case than in the experiment with only 25 events .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that the larger data sample allowed us to include one more moment in the fit .",
    "note that , according to the definition ( [ e3_47 ] ) , all wimps in our galactic neighborhood have velocity @xmath218 .",
    "this implies that a lower bound on @xmath66 can be derived from the highest observed @xmath56value , @xmath219 , see eq.([eqn204 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately for our standard set of input parameters , this method on average only yields lower bounds of about 400 ( 460 ) km / s for experiments with 25 ( 100 ) events .",
    "even the experiment with 100 events would then still allow 60% of all wimps to originate from a late infall component ; this is to be compared with the theoretical expectation @xmath220 .",
    "finally , we note that for @xmath221 , it will be essentially impossible to derive a meaningful upper bound on @xmath66 from these experiments : because the original `` shifted gaussian '' velocity distribution is already very small at our input value @xmath217 km / s , increasing @xmath66 has essentially no effect on the measured recoil spectrum .",
    "in this paper , we have developed methods that allow to extract information on the wimp velocity distribution from the recoil energy spectrum @xmath17 measured in elastic wimp  nucleus scattering experiments . in the long term",
    "this information can be used to test or constrain models of the dark halo of our galaxy ; this information would complement the information on the density distribution of wimps , which can be derived e.g. from measurements of the galactic rotation curve .    to this end , in sec .",
    "2 we derived expressions that allow to directly reconstruct the normalized one  dimensional velocity distribution function of wimps , @xmath5 , given an expression ( e.g. , a fit to data ) for the recoil spectrum .",
    "we have also derived formulae for the moments of @xmath21 .",
    "all these expressions are independent of the as yet unknown wimp density near the earth as well as of the wimp  nucleus cross section ; the only information about the nature of the wimp that is needed is its mass .    furthermore , in sec .  3 we have developed methods that allow to apply our expressions directly to data , without the need to fit the recoil spectrum to a functional form .",
    "we found that a good variable that allows direct reconstruction of @xmath21 is the average recoil energy in a given bin ( or `` window '' ; see sec .",
    "this average energy is sensitive to the slope of the recoil spectrum , which is the quantity we need to reconstruct @xmath21 .",
    "we carefully analyzed the statistical errors .",
    "unfortunately we found that several hundred events will be needed for this method to be able to extract meaningful information on @xmath21 .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that @xmath5 is normalized , i.e. , only the _ shape _ of this distribution contains meaningful information , and partly because this shape depends on the _ slope _ of the recoil spectrum , which is intrinsically difficult to determine .",
    "we therefore turned to an analysis of the moments of @xmath21 .",
    "we found that reliably estimating higher moments , and in particular estimating their errors , is difficult .",
    "the main reason is that these higher moments get large contributions from very rare events with large recoil energies .",
    "nevertheless we found that , based only on the first two or three moments , some non  trivial information can already be extracted from @xmath222 events .",
    "the main emphasis of this exploratory study was on the basic expressions as well as on their implementation in actual experiments .",
    "the models for @xmath21 we tried to constrain in our applications ( a constant in sec .",
    "3.2 , a `` late ",
    "infall '' component with fixed velocity in the earth rest frame in sec .",
    "3.3 ) are not physical ; nevertheless they illustrate the difficulties one will have in extracting information from these experiments that are of interest for the modeling of the galactic wimp distribution .",
    "our analysis is based on several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we ignored all experimental systematic uncertainties , as well as the uncertainty on the determination of the recoil energy @xmath8 .",
    "this is probably quite a good approximation , given that we found that we ll have to live with quite large statistical uncertainties in the foreseeable future ; recall that not a single wimp event has as yet been unambiguously recorded .",
    "we also assumed that our detector consists of a single isotope .",
    "this is quite realistic for the current semiconductor ( si or ge ) detectors .",
    "the cresst detector @xcite contains three different nuclei .",
    "however , by simultaneously measuring heat and light , one might be able to tell on an event  by  event basis which kind of nucleus has been struck . in this case , our methods can be applied straightforwardly to the three separate sub  spectra .",
    "our analyses treat each recorded event as signal , i.e. , we ignore backgrounds altogether . at least after introducing a lower cut @xmath24 on the recoil energy , this may in fact not be unrealistic for modern detectors , which contain cosmic ray veto and neutron shielding systems .",
    "background subtraction should be relatively straightforward when fitting some function to the data , which would allow to use the expressions of sec .",
    "2 . it should also be feasible in the method described in sec .  3.2 , if its effect on the average @xmath56values in the bins can be determined ; in particular , an approximately flat ( @xmath56independent ) background would not change the slope of the recoil spectrum . subtracting the background in the determination of the moments as described in sec .",
    "3.3 might be ( even ) more difficult .",
    "as noted earlier , we need to know the wimp mass @xmath223 .",
    "this is true for any reconstruction method based on data taken with a mono  isotopic detector . in this case",
    "one can always `` reconstruct '' @xmath5 , for any ( assumed ) value of @xmath223 .",
    "fortunately in well  motivated wimp models , @xmath223 can be determined with high accuracy from future collider data . even in this case",
    "one will want to check experimentally that the wimps seen in dark matter detection experiments are in fact the same ones produced at colliders .",
    "this can be done by using the methods developed here on two different data sets , obtained with different detector materials , and demanding consistent results for ( the moments of ) @xmath21 .",
    "the feasibility of such an analysis is currently under investigation .    in our analysis",
    "we ignored the annual modulation of the wimp flux .",
    "again , given the large statistical errors expected in the foreseeable future , this is a reasonable first approximation .",
    "nevertheless , eventually one will have to extend the formulae and methods developed here to allow for an annual modulation .",
    "this is fairly straightforward if the background is again negligible . on the other hand",
    ", new methods may be needed to extract information on @xmath21 in a situation where the total counting rate is dominated by background events ; this is most likely the case for the dama data @xcite , even if they indeed contain a signal , which remains highly controversial .    in summary , we have begun to explore what direct dark matter detection experiments can teach us about the velocity distribution of dark matter particles in our galactic neighborhood .",
    "our analyses show that this will require substantial data samples .",
    "we hope this will encourage our experimental colleagues to plan future experiments well beyond the stage of `` merely '' detecting dark matter .",
    "we thank holger drees for illuminating discussions on stochastics .",
    "this work was partially supported by the marie curie training research network `` universenet '' under contract no . mrtn - ct-2006 - 035863 , as well as by the european network of theoretical astroparticle physics entapp ilias / n6 under contract no .",

    "since v = , [ eqna01 ] we have dv = dq , [ eqna02 ] from eq.([eqn212 ] ) and according to the normalization condition in eq.([eqn214 ] ) , we have , f_1(v ) ~ dv & = & \\{-2 q } dq + & = & dq + & = & + & = & dq + & = & 1 , [ eqna03 ] where we have used the conditions |_q 0 and |_q 0 . eq.([eqn213 ] ) immediately followed from eq.([eqna03 ] ) .    using eqs.([eqna01 ] ) , ( [ eqna02 ] ) and integration by parts , we can also find the moments of @xmath21 , defined with a lower cut  off @xmath24 on the energy transfer , as follows : & = & _ v_min(q_thre)^v^n f_1(v ) ~ dv + & = & _ q_thre^^n dq + & = & _ q_thre^ q^(n+1)/2 dq + & = & ^n+1 \\ { _ q = q_thre + _ q_thre^q^(n-1)/2 dq } .",

    "starting point is the observation that we wish to compute the ratio of two integrals , [ eb1 ] = . in the second step",
