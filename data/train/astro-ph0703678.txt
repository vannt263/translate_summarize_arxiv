    "the collapse of massive stars on some occasions produce long duration @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "it was a common expectation that broad - lined and luminous type ic core - collapse supernovae ( sn ) accompany every long - duration grb @xcite , though it was not clear that such an expectation was justified on theoretical grounds .",
    "the grbs 060505 and 060614 were detected by ( the dedicated grb satellite ) _ swift _",
    "s @xmath0-ray burst alert telescope ( bat ) on 2006 may 5.275 and 2006 june 14.530 respectively @xcite .",
    "grb060505 was a faint burst with a duration of 4s .",
    "grb060614 had a duration of 102s and a pronounced hard to soft evolution .",
    "both were rapidly localised by _ swift _",
    "s x - ray telescope ( xrt ) .",
    "subsequent follow - up of these bursts led to the discovery of their optical afterglows , locating them in galaxies at low redshift : grb060505 at @xmath1 @xcite and grb060614 at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the relative proximity of these bursts engendered an expectation that a bright sn would be discovered a few days after the burst , as had been found before in other low - redshift long duration grbs .",
    "we monitored the afterglows of grb060505 and 060614 at optical / near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this led to early detections of the afterglows .",
    "we continued the monitoring campaign and obtained stringent upper limits on any re - brightening at the position of the optical afterglows up to 12 and 5 weeks after the bursts , respectively .",
    "the light - curves obtained based on this monitoring are shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] . for grb060505 we detected the optical afterglow at a single epoch in multiple bands ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , xu et  al .",
    "in preparation ) . all subsequent observations resulted in deep upper limits .",
    "for grb060614 we followed the decay of the optical afterglow in the r - band up to four nights after the burst .",
    "no source was detected to deep limits at later times .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] , the upper limits are far below the fluxes of previous ic sne , in particular sne associated with long grbs @xcite . for both grbs our @xmath7 limit around the time of expected maximum of a sn component is 80100 times fainter than sn1998bw . the very deep observations of grb060505 on may 23 and may 30 give a @xmath7 upper limit more than 250 times fainter than sn1998bw at a similar time .",
    "hence , any sn associated with grb060505 must have had a peak magnitude in the @xmath5-band fainter than about @xmath8 .",
    "these two sn - less grbs share no obvious characteristics in their prompt emission .",
    "grb060505 was one of the least luminous bursts discovered with swift with an isotropic - equivalent energy release of @xmath9erg .",
    "it had a relatively short duration , and was single - peaked with a very faint afterglow .",
    "grb060614 was about a hundred times more luminous with an isotropic - equivalent energy release of @xmath10erg , and it showed strong spectral evolution .",
    "its optical afterglow brightened for the first day @xcite , reminiscent of grb970508 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : hostspec ]    the host galaxy of grb060614 is significantly fainter than the host of grb060505 , with an absolute magnitude of about m@xmath20 .",
    "this is one of the least luminous grb host galaxies ever detected .",
    "grb060614 was observed with the gmos imaging spectrometer on the gemini 8-m on the night of 29 july 2006 .",
    "we detected the h and [ oiii ] emission lines and infer an sfr of 0.014m@xmath14yr@xmath15 .",
    "the specific sfr is 3m@xmath14yr@xmath15(l / l*)@xmath15 .",
    "sub - l * , star - forming host galaxies , like these two , are fairly common among long grb host galaxies @xcite . for comparison , the specific sfrs of the 4 previously studied nearby ( @xmath21 ) long grb host galaxies are 6 , 7 , 25 and 39m@xmath14yr@xmath15(l / l*)@xmath15 .",
    "hence , the specific sfrs of the two hosts studied here are slightly lower than the four previously studied nearby hosts , but the scatter in the rates is large and it is not possible to conclude that the host galaxies of grb060505 and grb060614 are qualitatively different from other @xmath21 long - grb host galaxies .",
    "the duration of the prompt emission grb060505 and grb060614 is 4s and 102s , respectively .",
    "hence , they are both well outside the classification of short bursts , i.e.  duration less than 2s @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting in this context that the typical long grbs 000301c at @xmath22 and 020602 at @xmath23 had durations of only 2s and 7s , respectively , so their rest - frame durations are significantly shorter than the 4s of even grb060505 .",
    "short grbs have previously had accompanying sne excluded @xcite .",
    "therefore , it might be speculated that both sn - less grbs studied here were extreme members of the class of progenitors responsible for short grbs .",
    "short grbs have in some cases been found to be associated with older stellar populations than long grbs , and it is widely expected that they are predominantly caused by merging compact objects @xcite .",
    "in addition to their long duration , the facts that 1 ) grb060505 and grb060614 can be localized to star - forming galaxies , 2 ) in the case of grb060505 even a star - forming region in a spiral arm of its host galaxy ( see figure  [ fig : hostspec ] ) , and 3 ) in the case of grb060614 the afterglow is located around the half - light radius of its star - forming host @xcite all strongly suggest that the progenitors were massive stars .",
    "the evidence in this paper should cause us to be more open - minded about the origins of short grbs : absence of sne has been an argument used to suport the idea that short grbs do not have a massive stellar progenitor .",
    "now we have observed long - duration sn - less grbs in star - forming regions , suggesting that a non - detection of a sn does not preclude a massive progenitor . in the near future , the location of the grb , i.e.  in a star - forming region or in an older component , may be the only way to discriminate between merging compact objects and massive stars as progenitors .",
    "in fact , several host galaxies for short grbs have been found to be as actively star - forming as some host galaxies of long grbs @xcite .",
    "the grb labels ` long ' and ` short ' have become synonymous with ` massive stars ' and ` other progenitors ' .",
    "these distinctions may need to be relaxed .",
    "it has also been suggested that grb060505 and grb060614 could in fact be more distant bursts and that the proposed hosts are only foreground galaxies . in the case of grb060505",
    ", it is very unlikely that the afterglow is superposed precisely on a star - forming knot in the spiral arm of a foreground galaxy ( figure  [ fig : hostspec]c ) if it was in fact more distant . in the case of grb060614",
    "the impact parameter is about @xmath24 , and the afterglow is located around the half - light radius of the proposed host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the _ swift_-uvot detection of the afterglow @xcite places an upper limit on the redshift of about @xmath25 . at such relatively low redshift",
    "the host galaxy should be detectable in the very deep hst images of the field , but no other galaxy than the proposed host galaxy is seen @xcite . furthermore , even at @xmath26 , any sn would still have to be @xmath27 magnitudes fainter than sn1998bw to remain undetected .",
    "therefore , it is very unlikely that either grb060505 or grb060614 are at higher redshifts than @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "all spectroscopically confirmed sn - grbs have peak magnitudes within about half a magnitude of sn1998bw . for x - ray flashes ( xrfs )",
    "there has been some evidence that associated sne may span a somewhat wider range of luminosities @xcite , but still well within the range of non  grb - selected type ic sne .",
    "any sn associated with these two long grbs must therefore have been substantially fainter than any sn ic seen to date .",
    "scaling the peak magnitude of a type ic sn with the ejected @xmath30ni mass suggests that the mass of @xmath30ni ejected in these cases is less than one percent of a solar mass .",
    "the non - appearance of a sn in these cases was a surprise and indicates that we have uncovered grbs with quite different properties from those studied previously .",
    "it is plausible that the origin of these bursts lies in one of the many sn - less grb progenitors suggested prior to the definitive association between grbs and sne .",
    "we note , however , that our results confirm a prediction within the collapsar model : that while direct black hole ( bh ) formation is likely to result in sne associated with grbs , ` fallback'-formed bhs could produce sn - less grbs @xcite .",
    "these authors cited immediately above argue that the nucleosynthetic yields from the explosion related to the fallback - formed bh are very different from those resulting from a direct - formed bh . in the fallback case , little @xmath30ni",
    "is synthesized and expelled , resulting in the prediction that only very faint sne , perhaps hundreds of times fainter than sn1998bw , should be observed in some grbs . among core collapse sne , a few very nickel deficient @xcite and low velocity @xcite type ii sne",
    "have been detected that were explained using this fallback mechanism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ) .",
    "it has been pointed out that given the relatively less massive progenitors , fallback bh formation should also be relatively common among ( collapsar ) grbs . in another variant of the collapsar model , progenitor stars with relatively low angular momentum",
    "could produce sn - less grbs @xcite .    that some massive stars explode with a sn expelling large amounts of nucleosynthesised gas at high velocities , while other massive stars die with a whisper ,",
    "clearly has consequences for our understanding of the energy input and the metal enrichment to the interstellar medium .",
    "until the era of gravitational wave detectors @xcite or more sensitive neutrino astronomy @xcite , it seems that grbs will be the only signals we get from the deaths of some massive stars .",
    "of the six long grbs or xrfs known to be at low redshift ( @xmath31 ) , two now have no associated sn , so the fraction of sn - less grbs could be substantial .",
    "we acknowledge benefits from collaboration within the eu fp5 research training network gamma - ray bursts : an enigma and a tool .",
    "the dark cosmology centre is funded by the dnrf .",
    "the observations presented in this article has been obtained from the eso la silla - paranal observatory and from the gemini observatory .",
