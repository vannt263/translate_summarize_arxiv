    "a massive star with a main - sequence mass @xmath11 ends up as a core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) .",
    "core collapse is inaugurated by electron capture for a star with an o+ne+mg core ( @xmath12 ) or fe photodisintegration for a star with an fe core ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "an explosion mechanism of ccsne is still under investigation , in particular , for the ccsn of an star with an fe core ( fe ccsn ) .",
    "recently , sophisticated multidimensional simulations discovered that neutrino - driven convection and/or standing - accretion shock instability enhances neutrino heating and initiates an outward flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "however , explosion energies @xmath14 are about one orders of magnitude smaller than a canonical value of a normal ccsn ( @xmath15  erg , e.g. , sn  1987a * ? ? ?",
    "the fate of the less - massive star with the o+ne+mg core is different from that of the star with an fe core @xcite .",
    "the o+ne+mg core is supported by electron degenerate pressure .",
    "the mass and density of the o+ne+mg core increase through phases of shell burning of he and h. as the o+ne+mg core grows , an envelope undergoes mass loss to reduce the h mass and he dredge - up to enhance he abundance .",
    "eventually , the star becomes a super - asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when the central density exceeds a critical value ( @xmath16 ) , electrons begin to be captured by magnesium , the degenerate pressure decreases , and thus the o+ne+mg core collapses gravitationally @xcite .",
    "ensuing core bounce and neutrino heating can eject the envelope and part of the o+ne+mg core because of weak inward momentum carried by the low - density sagb envelope @xcite .",
    "the explosion is called an electron - capture supernova ( ecsn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to the fe ccsn , the explosion of the ecsn is realized by first - principle simulations @xcite and a two - dimensional simulation demonstrates that the explosion takes place almost spherically @xcite .",
    "this is the only example of the ccsn being self - consistently produced .",
    "however , a low explosion energy derived from the simulations ( @xmath17  erg ) discriminates the ecsn from the normal ccsne .",
    "the first - principle hydrodynamics simulation enables self - consistent studies , e.g. ,  on nucleosynthesis and observational features .",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis in the ecsn is calculated by @xcite and @xcite based on @xcite .",
    "they find a small amount of @xmath2ni  in the ejecta [ @xmath18 and large production of elements with @xmath19 .",
    "the small @xmath2ni  mass is also decidedly different from the normal ccsne with @xmath20 .",
    "however , a theoretical light curve of the ecsn has not been presented and the observational features of the ecsn are not yet theoretically clarified .",
    "there are several sne which are suggested to be the ecsne .",
    "one of the old examples is the crab nebula being a remnant of sn  1054 .",
    "this is suggested from high he abundance @xcite , small ejecta mass @xcite , and low kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "one of the recent examples is sn  2008s @xcite , which is suggested from a dust - surrounding bright progenitor and its faintness and slow evolution .",
    "2008s - like objects have also been discovered ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this letter",
    ", we adopt the explosion properties derived by the state - of - the - art first - principle simulation and present the first self - consistent multicolor light curves of ecsne .",
    "we also investigate the contribution from a continuous energy release from a central remnant as the crab pulsar .",
    "finally , we compare the multicolor light curves with observations of ecsn candidates .",
    "we take an o+ne+mg core model with 1.377@xmath21 at a presupernova stage from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model is a core of a star with @xmath22 which is calculated from an he star with 2.2@xmath21 .",
    "a mass range of stars with the o+ne+mg core is @xmath0 but a progenitor of the ecsn should possess an sagb envelope ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , of which mass and abundance are influenced by @xmath23 , mass loss , and third dredge - up associated with thermal pulses .",
    "however , the mass loss is highly uncertain and no calculation of full thermal pulses has been available . for almost fully convective envelope models of the progenitor , therefore , we adopt various envelope mass @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and hydrogen abundance @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) by constructing hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium envelopes with binding energies of @xmath28  erg ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "density structures are shown in figure  [ fig : presn ] .",
    "the luminosity of the progenitor models is @xmath29  erg  s@xmath5@xcite and their radii are @xmath30  km .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr ] demonstrates that the luminosity is roughly consistent with the progenitor of sn  2008s @xcite and is located at a bright tip of the sagb stars @xcite .",
    "the explosion is initiated by a thermal bomb ) . ] with the explosion energy derived by the first - principle simulation ( @xmath31  erg , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution is followed by a multigroup radiation hydrodynamical code stella @xcite , in which one - group @xmath32-ray transfer is calculated and in situ absorption of positron is assumed for energy deposition from @xmath2ni-@xmath2co  radioactive decay .",
    "an abundance distribution in the o+ne+mg core after the explosion and mass of heavy elements are taken from the model st in @xcite , which yields @xmath3 of @xmath2ni .",
    "we note that no @xmath2ni  is synthesized in the envelope due to the low temperature of @xmath33  k.    we also investigate the contribution from the pulsar spin - down luminosity that could be bright at birth .",
    "for example , the initial spin - down luminosity of the crab pulsar was @xmath34  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "erg  s@xmath5 , @xcite ) with an equation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are initial spin - down luminosity , a spin - down timescale , and a braking index of the crab pulsar , respectively . ] since the pulsar spin - down luminosity can vary on individual ecsne and the deposition efficiency of an energy released from the pulsar is unknown , we expediently adopt the initial spin - down luminosity of the crab pulsar and assume that the released energy is fully deposited at the bottom of the ejecta ( `` full deposition '' ) or deposited pursuant to the same one - group transport as @xmath32-rays from the radioactive decay ( `` one - group transport '' ) .",
    "in the explosion of the model with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( figs .  [ fig : str]a-[fig : str]b ) , a shock wave is accelerated up to @xmath41  km  s@xmath5  during the first @xmath42  s due to the steep density gradient at the bottom of the envelope and decelerated down to @xmath43  km  s@xmath5  by shock emergence from the stellar surface .",
    "such drastic deceleration of the shock develops severe rayleigh - taylor instability .    at the shock emergence , the ecsn flashes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdep]a ) .",
    "the phenomenon is called a shock breakout , bolometrically brightest .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath44 at the shock breakout .",
    "a peak wavelength at the shock breakout is @xmath45    and bolometric luminosity is as bright as @xmath46  erg  s@xmath5 . adopting a dust evaporation radius @xcite and evaporation temperature for a short flash @xcite",
    ", the shock breakout can destroy the circumstellar dust up to @xmath47  km for a case of carbon dust .    as the sn ejecta cools down",
    ", the ecsn enters a plateau phase lasting @xmath48  days .",
    "the plateau luminosity is @xmath49  erg  s@xmath5 , which is as bright as typical type ii plateau supernovae ( sne ii - p , e.g. , sn  2004et , @xcite ) , and a photospheric velocity at the plateau is @xmath50  km  s@xmath5 , which is slightly slower than typical sne ii - p .",
    "the plateau luminosity is fainter and the duration is longer for an explosion of a star with larger @xmath24 and higher @xmath26 .",
    "the plateau is followed by a tail .",
    "the luminosity suddenly fades by @xmath9 mag at the transition because of the small @xmath51 .",
    "the tail luminosity declines gradually at a rate of @xmath52  mag  day  @xmath5 which is slightly faster than the energy release rate from the @xmath2codecay .",
    "the multicolor light curves of the model with @xmath39 and @xmath40 are shown in figure  [ fig : lcdep]b .",
    "the photospheric temperature decreases after the shock breakout .",
    "thus , the peak wavelength shifts to redder bands with time and the optical luminosity increases gradually .",
    "the light curves in the bluer bands peak at earlier epochs , e.g. , @xmath53  days in the @xmath54 band and @xmath55  days in the @xmath56 band .",
    "in contrast to typical sne ii - p , the @xmath54 and @xmath56 light curves do not show a plateau and begin to decline immediately after the peak .",
    "the light curves in the bands redder than the @xmath57 band peak at the end of the plateau .",
    "the multicolor light curves drop at the transition to the tail as the bolometric light curve does .",
    "the decline rates of the tail are higher for bluer bands .",
    "the pulsar spin - down only influences the tail because the spin - down luminosity of the crab pulsar is much fainter than the plateau luminosity .",
    "the ecsn shines with the energy release from the @xmath2codecay at the beginning of the tail and then the energy release from the newborn pulsar becomes dominant at a late phase ( @xmath58  days , fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdep]c ) .",
    "the tail luminosity is floored in the full deposition model , while the decline rate is lowered in the one - group transport model .",
    "the tail luminosity can be @xmath59  mag brighter than the model without the pulsar contribution at @xmath60  days .",
    "the crab nebula is the most famous and conspicuous supernova remnant .",
    "optical and uv observations illustrate that the crab nebula is notably he - rich [ @xmath61 , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "in addition to the he - rich abundance , a small ejecta mass ( @xmath62 , @xcite ) and low kinetic energy ( @xmath63  erg , is assumed . the kinetic energy is doubled by adopting @xmath62 . ]",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that the crab nebula is a remnant of the ecsn .",
    "an expansion of the crab nebula was discovered in the early 1920s @xcite and , in the same year , the proximity of the crab nebula to sn  1054 was indicated @xcite .",
    "an explosion date estimated by turning back the expansion is consistent with sn  1054 @xcite .",
    "hence , it is widely believed that the expanding crab nebula is a remnant of sn  1054 .",
    "a sudden appearance of sn  1054 was recorded in medieval times and its optical light curve is enscrolled in historiographies @xcite .",
    "they described the dates of the first and last sightings and its brightness .",
    "however , the medieval observations were rough and unconfident .",
    "thus , reliability of the archives is deeply scrutinized by @xcite . referring the conclusion of that paper , we adopt the following three points with errorbars of @xmath64  mag and @xmath65  days ;",
    "( 1 ) sn  1054 was as bright as venus ( optical magnitude @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) on july 4 , 1054 and might be visible earlier than july 4 , 1054 ( e.g. , may 10 , 1054 ) , ( 2 ) sn  1054 was visible in daytime for 23 days from july 4 , 1054 and @xmath68 on july 27 , 1054 , and ( 3 ) sn  1054 disappeared in night on april 6 , 1056 with @xmath69 .",
    "we correct the distance ( @xmath70  kpc , @xcite ) and reddening [ @xmath71 , @xcite ] to the crab nebula .",
    "we compare an `` optical ''    and a root - mean - square deviation of @xmath72    @xcite . ]",
    "light curve of the model with @xmath39 and @xmath40 against the observations of sn  1054 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lccomp]a ) . here",
    ", an optical peak of the model is set to be july 4 , 1054 .",
    "the ecsn model well reproduces the bright and short plateau of sn  1054 .",
    "the epoch of the transition from the plateau to the tail corresponds to the date at which sn  1054 disappeared from the daytime sky .",
    "the tail luminosities of the full deposition and one - group transport models are brighter and fainter than sn  1054 , respectively . if the deposition efficiency is the middle of these models , a gradually - declining optical light curve can cross with the last observation of sn  1054 .",
    "we note that the last point of sn  1054 is not compatible with the ecsn model without the pulsar contribution as suggested in @xcite .",
    "sn  2008s is suggested to be the ecsn because the progenitor is bright and surrounded by dust and because sn  2008s is faint and evolves slowly @xcite .",
    "however , the plateau luminosity of the ecsn is as bright as that of normal sne ii - p due to the large presupernova radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lcdep]a ) . thus , we conclude that the ecsn model based on the first - principle simulation @xcite is incompatible with the faintness of sn  2008s ( fig .  [",
    "fig : lccomp]b ) .",
    "however , there is a caveat that the plateau luminosity and duration depend on @xmath14 and @xmath24 ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xcite ) . if an explosion energy may be different for individual ecsne , e.g. , due to rotation , the faint and slowly - evolving sn  2008s could be explained . applying the scaling laws and taking @xmath75  erg  s@xmath5  and @xmath76  days of sn  2008s",
    ", we can derive its explosion properties ; @xmath77  erg and @xmath78 .",
    "a series of first - principle simulation and light curve calculations are required to confirm that such the explosion is feasible and explains the multicolor light curves of sn  2008s .",
    "we present multicolor light curves of ecsne with various @xmath24 and @xmath26 based on the results of the first - principle simulation @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the shock breakout has a peak luminosity of @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5  and can evaporate circumstellar dust up to @xmath79  km for the case of carbon dust and that the plateau luminosity and the duration of the ecsne are @xmath49  erg  s@xmath5  and @xmath48  days , respectively .",
    "the brighter and shorter plateau is realized by the model with smaller @xmath24 and lower @xmath26 .",
    "the plateau is followed by the tail with the luminosity drop by @xmath9  mag .",
    "the tail luminosity declines by @xmath52  mag  day  @xmath5 for the model without the pulsar contribution , while , if the pulsar contributes to the light curve , the tail light curve is floored or the decline rate is lowered .",
    "the contribution from the pulsar spin - down luminosity as bright as the crab pulsar is prominent only in the tail .",
    "the bright and short plateau and low explosion energy of the ecsn model are consistent with sn  1054 . the plateau is not reproduced with a low - energy explosion of a red supergiant star with heavy @xmath24 .",
    "the tail luminosity of sn  1054 could be explained by the spin - down luminosity of the newborn crab pulsar .",
    "the deceleration of the shock wave in the ecsn ( figs .",
    "[ fig : str]a-[fig : str]b ) is also favorable to produce filamentary structures observed in the crab nebula ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus the observed features of sn 1054 are naturally reproduced by the ecsn model .",
    "the luminosity of interaction of the ecsn with a circumstellar medium reaches only @xmath80 of the plateau of sn 1054 for a typical sagb star with the mass loss rate of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "thus an extremely dense and confined ( @xmath82 a few @xmath83  cm ) circumstellar matter is required to explain the bright and short plateau of sn 1054 @xcite .",
    "the optical light curve of sn  1054 constrains the initial spin - down luminosity of the crab pulsar .",
    "radio observations suggest @xmath84  yr and @xmath85  erg  s@xmath5  to produce relic relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "however , such high @xmath36 leads to much brighter optical luminosity than sn  1054 at april 6 , 1056 .",
    "our result favors @xmath86  yr and @xmath87  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "these are also supported by a broad spectral evolution model of the pulsar wind nebula @xcite .",
    "the typical ejecta velocity of the ecsn model with @xmath39 and @xmath40 is @xmath88  km  s@xmath5 , which is consistent with the low expansion velocity of the crab nebula @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the velocity of a wind blown from the progenitor is @xmath89  km  s@xmath5 . adopting the duration of the sagb phase ( @xmath90  yr , @xcite )",
    ", the sagb wind extends only upto @xmath91  km ( @xmath92  pc ) , which is similar to an apparent size of the crab nebula ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the radius is smaller than the typical ejecta location of @xmath93  km ( @xmath94  pc ) .",
    "therefore , the forward shock should locate in a low - density circumstellar wind blown at the core he - burning phase or in an interstellar medium .",
    "this could be a reason why the forward shock of the crab nebula has not been found .",
    "on the other hand , the plateau of the ecsn model is much brighter than that of sn  2008s .",
    "if the explosion energy of ecsne is exactly @xmath1  erg as derived by the first - principle simulation @xcite , the multicolor light curves of the ecsn are inconsistent with those of sn  2008s",
    ". however , there could be a caveat that the explosion energy may vary on individual ecsne .",
    "the ecsn explosion with @xmath77  erg and @xmath78 might be compatible with sn2008s .",
    "if sn  2008s is the ecsn with @xmath77  erg and @xmath78 , we can speculate on shock breakout luminosity and @xmath51 ; according to analytic dependence @xcite , the luminosity of the shock breakout is @xmath95  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "carbon dust at @xmath96  km is evaporated by the shock breakout .",
    "the size of a dust - free cavity is roughly consistent with that estimated from a midinfrared observation of sn  2008s @xcite .",
    "the explosion energy is comparable to a gravitational binding energy of the progenitor at @xmath97 .",
    "thus , sn  2008s is likely to eject materials above the outer edge of the core and yield @xmath98 , which is slightly smaller than an estimate from the observed tail of sn  2008s ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we propose that the light curve tail of sn  2008s is powered by a spin - down luminosity of a newborn neutron star as sn  1054 .",
    "we note a caveat that sn  2008s is a type iin sn and thus could be contributed to by interacting with a circumstellar medium .    the number of sne sharing the characteristics of the ecsn , i.e. , a bright and short plateau and faint tail , is small , if the sn  2008s - like transients are not the ecsne .",
    "we also note that faint and low - energy sne ii - p , e.g. , sn  1997d and sn  1999br @xcite , have a slower photospheric velocity at the plateau ( @xmath99  km  s@xmath5 ) than the ecsn .",
    "the scarcity of the ecsne might stem from a small mass range of a star ending up as ecsne at solar metallicity ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . since a significant contribution of ecsne to the production of @xmath100ca , @xmath101zn , and @xmath102zr",
    "is suggested @xcite , chemical evolution models taking into account the scarcity is required to study the origin of these isotopes .",
