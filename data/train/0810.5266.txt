    "following the same notation in @xcite , in the presence of three majorana neutrino states , the neutrino gauge eigen state can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the interaction between charged lepton and majorana neutrino mass eigen states is as : @xmath22 in the conventional type - i seesaw model where @xmath23 is of order @xmath24 gev , the mixing @xmath25 are highly suppressed .",
