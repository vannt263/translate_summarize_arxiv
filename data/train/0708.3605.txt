    "the problem of explaining the structure formation of the universe is one of the most fascinating at the beginning of this new millennium . from the recent experimental developments and observations ,",
    "cosmology has acquired the status of a high precision area of research @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent and independent observational data measured in the cmbr on various angular scales @xcite , in type ia supernovae @xcite , as well as in galaxy surveys @xcite , suggest that @xmath2 , or that @xmath3 and @xmath4 , implying the existence of dark energy and dark matter , respectively . however , the nature of dark components is still unknown .",
    "these observations favour the now standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model . despite some problems on galactic scales revealed by numerical simulations , which could be explained with some alternative models ( e.g. warm dark matter ) , large scale structure simulations , predicted by the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "agree well with observations .",
    "naturally , particular inflationary scenarios motivated by different particle physics theories have their own dark matter candidates , such as axion , neutralino , higgs particle , among others , as well as a quintessence field @xcite . in order to include such particles in cosmological models",
    "one usually adds a scalar field ( sf ) equation to the general relativity field equations .",
    "one possibility is to couple this field non - minimally to gravity to have a scalar - tensor theory of gravity ( stt ) .    in this work we present some results of the role played by a massive non -",
    "minimally coupled sf on the @xmath0cdm universe structure formation process .",
    "our theoretical model is built from a general stt static sf which modifies the cosmological dynamics and the newtonian gravity potential on particles ; the dynamical full treatment of sf perturbations is now under development .",
    "we evolve a cosmological cube using standard @xmath0cdm equations with periodic boundary conditions , where the particles interact through the newtonian force plus an additional term .",
    "the latter comes from a yukawa type potential derived from the newtonian limit of a stt .",
    "it should be noted that in the present work the sf does not replace the dark matter or dark energy , but rather coexists with them . to perform the simulations",
    "we have modified a standard serial treecode developed by one of us ( marm ) @xcite and gadget 1 @xcite in order to take into account the contribution of the yukawa potential .",
    "in a previous paper we found the solutions for the potential - density pair problem in the newtonian limit of a scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite . here ,",
    "we applied those results and found that the potential of a single particle of mass @xmath5 is given by @xcite @xmath6 for local scales , @xmath7 , deviations from the newtonian theory are exponentially suppressed , and for @xmath8 the newtonian constant diminishes ( augments ) to @xmath9 for positive ( negative ) @xmath10 .",
    "this means that equation ( [ phi_new ] ) fulfills all local tests of the newtonian dynamics , and it is only constrained by experiments or tests on scales larger than or of the order of @xmath11 , which in our case is of the order of galactic scales .    to simulate cosmological systems ,",
    "the expansion of the universe has to be taken into account . here",
    ", we employ a cosmological model with a static scalar field which is consistent with the newtonian limit given by eq .",
    "( [ phi_new ] ) .",
    "thus , the scale factor , @xmath12 , is given by the following friedman model , @xmath13\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the matter and energy density evaluated at present , respectively .",
    "we notice that the source of the cosmic evolution is deviated by the term @xmath17 when compared to the standard friedman - lemaitre model .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to define a new density parameter by @xmath18 .",
    "this new density parameter is such that @xmath19 , which implies a flat universe , and this shall be assumed in our following computations , where we consider @xmath20 . for positive values of @xmath10 ,",
    "a flat cosmological model demands to have a factor @xmath21 more energetic content ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) than in standard cosmology . on the other hand , for negative values of @xmath10 one needs a factor @xmath21 less @xmath22 and @xmath23 to have a flat universe . to be consistent with the cmb spectrum and structure formation numerical experiments ,",
    "cosmological constraints must be applied on @xmath10 in order for it to be within the range @xmath24 @xcite .    in the newtonian limit of stt of gravity , the newtonian motion equation for a particle @xmath25",
    "is written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the comovil coordinate , and the sum includes all periodic images of particle @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is @xmath30 which , for small distances compared to @xmath11 , is @xmath31 and , for long distances , is @xmath32 , as in newtonian physics .    we now analyze the general effect that the constant @xmath10 has on the dynamics .",
    "the role of @xmath10 in our approach is as follows . on one hand , to construct a flat model we have set the condition @xmath19 , which implies having @xmath21 times the energetic content of the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this essentially means that we have an increment by a factor of @xmath21 times the amount of matter , for positive values of @xmath10 , or a reduction of the same factor for negative values of @xmath10 .",
    "increasing or reducing this amount of matter affects the matter term on the r.h.s . of the equation of motion ( [ eq_motion ] ) , but the amount affected cancels out with the term @xmath21 in the denominator of ( [ eq_motion ] ) stemming from the new newtonian potential ( [ phi_new ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the factor @xmath33 augments ( diminishes ) for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath10 for small distances compared to @xmath11 , resulting in more ( less ) structure formation for positive ( negative ) values of @xmath10 compared to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "for @xmath34 the dynamics is essentially newtonian .",
    "we now present results for the @xmath0cdm model of the universe model previously described .",
    "because the visible component is the smaller one and given our interest to test the consequences of including a sf contribution to the evolution equations , our model excludes gas particles , but all its mass has been added to the dark matter .",
    "therefore , our model is as follows .",
    "we start our simulation with an initial distribution of @xmath35 particles in a box with sides of @xmath36 mpc at @xmath37 .",
    "this case is similar to the one that comes with gadget 1 @xcite . at present epoch , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 km / s / mpc , @xmath42 .",
    "we restrict the values of @xmath10 to the interval @xmath24 @xcite and use @xmath43 mpc , since this scale turns out to be an intermediate scale between the size of the clump groups and the separation of the formed groups .",

    "one notes clearly how the sf modifies the matter structure of the system .",
    "the most dramatic cases are ( b ) and ( c ) where we have used @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . given the argument at the end of last section , in the case of ( b ) , for @xmath7 , the effective gravitational pull has been augmented by a factor of 2 , in contrast to case ( c ) where it has diminished by a factor of 1/2 ; in model ( d ) the pull diminishes only by a factor of 3/4 .",
    "that is why one observes for @xmath50 more structure formation in ( b ) , less in ( d ) , and lesser in model ( c ) .",
    "the effect is then , for a growing positive @xmath10 , to speed up the growth of perturbations , then of halos and then of clusters , whereas negative @xmath10 values ( @xmath51 ) tend to slow down the growth .     of a @xmath0cdm universe .",

    "2(b ) we show , for the same group , circular velocity curves , computed using @xmath56 .",
    "the case with @xmath47 corresponds to higher values of @xmath57 , since this depends on how much accumulated mass there is at a distance @xmath58 and this is enhanced by the factor @xmath33 for positive values of @xmath10 .",
    "the groups are at most 2 mpc in size at @xmath45 , which means that the inner structure is such that @xmath50 , being affected by the factor @xmath33 as explained at the end of section 2 . while for @xmath59 the overall structure formation process is governed by newtonian physics , which is the reason why the overall structure of the models in fig .",
    "1 is similar .",
    "we have used a general , static stt that is compatible with local observations by the appropriate definition of the background field constant , i.e. @xmath60 .",
    "a direct consequence of our approach is that the amount of matter ( energy ) has to be increased for positive values of @xmath10 and diminished for negative values of @xmath10 with respect to the standard @xmath0cdm model in order to have a flat cosmological model .",
    "quantitatively , our model demands to have @xmath61 and this changes the amount of dark matter and energy of the model for a flat cosmological model , as assumed .",
    "the general gravitational effect is that the interaction including the sf changes by a factor @xmath62 for @xmath63 in comparison with the newtonian case .",
    "thus , for @xmath64 the growth of structures speeds up in comparison with the newtonian case . for the @xmath65 case",
    "the effect is to diminish the formation of structures .",
    "for @xmath66 the dynamics is essentially newtonian .    using the resulting modified dynamical equations ,",
    "we have studied the structure formation process of a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "we varied the amplitude and sign of the strength of the sf ( @xmath10 ) in the interval ( -1,1 ) and performed several 3d - simulations with the same initial conditions . from our simulations with different values of @xmath10",
    ", we have found that the inclusion of sf changes local dynamical properties of the most massive group considered , and accordingly the density profile and circular velocity , however , the overall structure is somewhat similar . here , we notice that we have also studied other massive groups , in particular one smaller group located approximately at @xmath67 mpc , @xmath68 mpc in fig .",
    "the trends are quite similar to the most massive group , so that our conclusions prevail .    in this work",
    "we only varied the amplitude of the sf ( @xmath10 ) leaving the scale length ( @xmath11 ) of the sf unchanged .",
    "after some preliminary runs , the increase of @xmath11 enhances the structure formation process for @xmath10 positive , and the decrease of @xmath11 makes the structure grow at a slower rate . in a future work we will study an ampler space parameter and with a much better resolution .",
    "also , the cosmological initial conditions will be constructed using the matter density field corresponding to the modified gravity .",
