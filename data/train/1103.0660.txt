    "most seyfert galaxies show some spectral lines from forbidden transitions of highly ionised ions in their spectra , e.g. [ fe vii ] , [ fe x ] , [ fe xi ] and even [ fe xiv ] @xcite .",
    "these emission lines are often blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of the agn and have velocity widths which are between those of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) , and the broad - line region ( blr , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in some rare cases",
    "many forbidden high ionisation lines ( fhils ) of relatively high equivalent width have been detected .",
    "examples include iii zw 77 @xcite , tololo 0109 - 383 @xcite and eso 138 g1 @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanisms and conditions that allow strong fhils to be produced have been debated for some time : whether there is a continuity from the photoionisation processes which produce the lower ionisation lines in the nlr ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or there is an entirely different mechanism for their formation ( e.g. collisional excitation in a high temperature gas ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "given that the transitions associated with many of the fhils have high critical densities ( n@xmath13@xmath910@xmath14 @xmath15 ) , it has been suggested that they may originate in the innermost torus wall facing the illuminating source .",
    "studies of the high critical density [ fe vii]@xmath06086 emission line across seyfert galaxies from types 1 - 2 , including intermediate types , find that its strength increases relative to the low ionisation lines from type 2 to type 1 .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of the orientation - based division between seyfert types ( e.g. @xcite ) : as the seyfert type gets closer to a seyfert 1 , more of the emission from the inner torus becomes visible to the observer ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the high critical density lines that are preferentially emitted by the torus are likely to be stronger in type 1 objects , as observed .",
    "however , to date the idea that the [ fe vii ] emission lines are associated with the torus has not been thoroughly tested using detailed emission line ratios that measure physical conditions accurately .",
    "although it seems plausible that at least some of the fhil emission arises in the torus , the causes of the diversity in both the relative strength and kinematics of the fhils remain uncertain .",
    "one possibility is that the unusually strong fhils observed in some objects are symptomatic of a recent energetic occurrence which is able to illuminate the region that produces these lines @xcite ; suggestions for such events include the rapid accretion of material from the ism , the tidal disruption of a stars by the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , gamma - ray bursts and supernovae @xcite .",
    "the unusual strength of the fhils in objects such as iii zw 77 , tololo 0109 - 383 and eso 138 g1 provides us with a rare opportunity to study the nature of the region of the agn which emits them , and thus helps us to better understand the structure of agn in general .    this paper reports an investigation of the object q1131 + 16 , which has the richest spectrum of fhils yet reported for an agn .",
    "q1131 + 16 was discovered in the 2mass survey and was classified as a seyfert 2 galaxy with a redshift of 0.174 .",
    "it belongs to sample of quasar - like objects identified on the basis of their red near - ir colours ( j - k@xmath92.0 ) in the 2mass survey @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present deep optical and infrared spectra of q1131 + 16 , and use these to deduce the physical conditions and kinematics of the fhil emission lines , with the aim of investigating their origin .",
    "the cosmological parameters used throughout this paper are adopted from wmap : @xmath16 = 71 km s@xmath17 , @xmath18 = 0.27 and @xmath19 = 0.73 @xcite , resulting in a spatial scale of 3.46 kpc arcsec@xmath17 .",
    "low resolution optical spectroscopic observations of q1131 + 16 were taken on 9th february 2007 with the isis dual - arm spectrograph on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma as part of a spectroscopic survey of a representative sample red , quasar - like objects .",
    "the full sample for this survey comprised a complete ra - limited sub - sample of 24 objects with ( j - k@xmath92 ) and @xmath20 selected from the list of @xcite , which is itself representative of the population of red , 2mass - selected quasars .",
    "the unusually strong fhil in q1131 + 16 were discovered serendipitously in the course of this survey .    in the red ,",
    "the r158r grating was used with the redplus ccd , and in the blue , the r300b grating was used with the eev12 ccd .",
    "a dichroic at 5300  was employed to obtain spectra with useful wavelength ranges @xmath63250 - 5250  in the blue , and @xmath65200 - 9500  in the red . to reduce the effects of differential refraction",
    ", all exposures were taken when q1131 + 16 was at low airmass ( sec @xmath21 @xmath2 1.1 ) and with the slit aligned close to the parallactic angle .",
    "the seeing for the night of the observations varied from 0.8 to 1.3 arcseconds ( fwhm ) .",
    "sets of three 600s exposures were taken on both arms simultaneously , giving a total exposure time of 1800s .",
    "the data were taken with a 1.5 arcsecond slit along a position angle pa315 . to eliminate contamination from second order emission ,",
    "a gg495 blocking filter was introduced into the isis red arm .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard way ( bias subtraction , flat fielding , cosmic ray removal , wavelength calibration , flux calibration ) using packages in iraf .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were also corrected for spatial distortions of the ccd . to reduce wavelength calibration errors due to flexure of the telescope and instrument ,",
    "arc spectra were taken at the position of the object on the sky ; the estimated wavelength calibration accuracy is 0.1  in both the blue and red respectively ( however , this may be an underestimate at the extreme edges of the spectra ) .",
    "the atmospheric absorption features were removed by dividing by the spectrum of a telluric standard ( bd+17  2352 ) , taken close in time and airmass to the observations of q1131 + 16 . the spectral resolution , calculated using the widths of the night sky emission lines , was 6.11 @xmath7 0.74  in the blue and 10.96 @xmath7 0.83  in the red ( measured in the observed frame of the spectrum ) .",
    "the spatial pixel scales of the 2d spectra are 0.4 arcseconds in the blue and 0.44 arcseconds in the red , and the relative flux calibration uncertainty  based on 11 observations of 8 flux standard stars taken throughout the run  is estimated to be @xmath75% .",
    "the spectra were extracted and analysed using the starlink packages figaro and dipso .      in order to test the possibility that the emission lines of q1131 + 16 are variable",
    ", a follow - up spectrum was taken using gmos on the gemini south telescope at cerro pachon .",
    "spectroscopic and imaging observations using gmos were taken on the 21st february 2010 during gemini queue observation time as part of the program gs-2009b - q-87 .",
    "the spectral observations comprised three 600 second exposures using a central wavelength 5000  at an airmass of 1.46 , and a 1.5 arcseconds slit aligned along position angle pa163@xmath22  close to the parallactic angle for the centre of the observations .",
    "this resulted in a spectrum with a useful wavelength range @xmath63700 - 6450 .",
    "the observations of the flux standard star , feige56 , had the same set - up but with an exposure time of 10 seconds , taken at an airmass of 1.61 and with a 5 arcsecond slit .",
    "deep gmos images were also taken using an r filter at an airmass of 1.56 .",
    "each exposure of the imaging observations had an exposure time of 250 seconds , and the data were taken in a 4 point dither pattern , resulting in a total exposure time of 1000s .",
    "the seeing was estimated to be 0.75@xmath70.02 arcseconds ( fwhm ) , based on measurements of stars in the gmos image .",
    "the spectra were extracted and analysed using the starlink packages figaro and dipso , and the iraf packages gemini and noao .",
    "analysis of the night sky lines implies a wavelength calibration uncertainty of 0.50@xmath70.06  for the spectrum .",
    "the spectral resolution , calculated using the widths of the night sky emission lines , was 7.12 @xmath7 0.11  in the observed frame of the observations , and the spatial pixel scale is 0.147 arcseconds per pixel .",
    "comparisons between the wht and gemini spectra demonstrate that the fluxes of the stronger emission lines ( e.g. [ o iii]@xmath234363,4959&5007 , [ ne v]@xmath03426 , [ fe vii]@xmath0 3759 ) and continuum agree within 20% between the two sets of observations .",
    "this is remarkable considering that the two sets of observations were taken with different instruments , at different slit position angles and under different seeing conditions .",
    "the gmos image was reduced using the standard gemini pipeline reduction software .",
    "the photometric calibration used the zero point magnitude for the r filter advertised on the gmos south website , taking full account of the airmass and exposure time of the observations .      on the night starting the 2nd march 2010 we obtained a 1.388  2.419@xmath24 m spectrum of q1131 + 16 using the hk grism in liris @xcite on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope on la palma .",
    "the spectrum has a dispersion of 9.7  per pixel , and a 1 arcsecond slit was used , giving a spectral resolution of @xmath640 .",
    "the seeing was approximately 2 arcseconds , and the night suffered from heavy cirrus .",
    "a total exposure time of 88 minutes was obtained over airmasses ranging from 1.0 to 2.2 .",
    "the total exposure was divided into 240 second sub - exposures and the telescope was nodded in the standard manner to aid sky subtraction .",
    "a random jitter of 10 arcseconds was added to the default nod positions to limit the impact of bad pixels .",
    "observations of the a5v star bd+16 2325 were also taken to correct for the effects of telluric absorption and to provide a relative flux calibration .",
    "both stars were observed with a slit position angle of zero degrees . for a more detailed description of the reduction process ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , it is more challenging to explain why the fhil are significantly stronger relative to the low ionization lines in q1131 + 16 than in typical type 2 agn @xcite .",
    "given the geometry in figure 22 , we would expect to observe significant fhil emission over a range of viewing angles , even if the quasar nucleus itself is obscured ; rather than a sharp cut - off , for this simple geometry , the strength of the fhil would gradually diminish as the orientation of the axis of the torus to the line of sight increased ( i.e. the torus became more edge - on ) .",
    "therefore , although the particular geometry shown in figure 22 would maximise the fhil emission , it is unlikely that a specific geometry alone can explain the rarity of objects like q1131 + 16 .",
    "we now discuss three further factors that might lead to the fhil appearing relatively strong compared with the general population of type 2 agn .    * * a lack of conventional nlr emission . *",
    "if the emission from a `` conventional '' nlr on a scale of @xmath6100  pc  1  kpc were strong , this would dilute the fhil emission , and the overall spectrum would not appear unusual relative to other type 2 agn .",
    "therefore , the conventional nlr emission must be relatively weak in the case of q1131 + 16 and other similar objects .",
    "weak nlr emission can arise if the covering factor of the nlr is relatively small , or if the illuminating agn has only recently been triggered ( within the last 100  1000  yr ) , so that the ionising radiation has not had time to traverse the scale of the nlr .",
    "however , while the lack of a conventional nlr might help to explain the unusual emission line ratios , it would not explain the unusually high equivalent widths measured for many of the emission lines in q1131 + 16 .",
    "indeed , if this was the dominant factor we would expect the emission lines in q1131 + 16 to have _ lower _ equivalent widths than most other type 2 agn , which is clearly not the case . *",
    "* a lack of obscuration by large - scale dust structures that are not coplanar with the torus . * along with a compact torus on a scale of  1  100  pc , many active galaxies show evidence for larger dust lane structures on a scale of  100  pc  5  kpc . if the dust lanes are not exactly co - planar with the torus structures ( e.g. thicker or different orientation ) , they will make it more difficult to observe the inner face of the torus , thus reducing the strength of the optical fhil emission , and narrowing the range of angles over which the fhil would appear strong . while the lack such large - scale dust structures would certainly increase the chance of observing unusually strong fhil , their presence would in any case reduce the range of viewing angles over which the fhil would be visible . * * a recently triggered agn . *",
    "if the agn has only recently been triggered then , not only might this result in reduced emission from the conventional nlr ( see above ) , but the inner wall of the torus itself might not yet have reached an equilibrium radius set by dust sublimation . in this case , the clouds close to the agn are likely to be in the process of evaporation by the strong agn radiation field @xcite and , depending on the density gradient , might have a higher ionisation parameter than clouds at the sublimation radius , leading to relatively strong fhil . the problem with this explanation for q1131",
    "+ 16 is that the radius of the fhil emission line region is similar to the estimated sublimation radius of the torus ( see @xmath25 4.4 ) , suggesting an equilibrium situation .",
    "however , it is possible that future refinement of the physical conditions of the fhil in q1131 + 16 and the bolometric luminosity of its agn might lead to a revision of this picture .",
    "overall , while a specific viewing angle is likely to provide an important part of the explanation for the unusual spectrum of q1131 + 16 , one or more of the other factors discussed above may also be significant .",
    "as mentioned previously , there are a few similar objects in which the fhils are unusually strong ( iii zw 77 , tololo 0109 - 383 and eso 138 g1 ) . the key properties of these objects , as derived from their fhils , are presented in table 4 .",
    "in particular , we note that the densities derived from the fhils are consistently high .",
    "also all the objects show a particularly low [ o iii](5007/4363 ) line ratio when compared to ` typical ' seyfert galaxies ( although in this respect q1131 + 16 is the most extreme ) .",
    "finally , all the objects show relatively modest fhil line widths ( fwhm ) , with the exception of eso 138 g1 whose line widths are larger .    because there are relatively few objects with such unusual features , it is entirely plausible that the properties of all these objects can be explained in a similar way e.g. with a specific viewing angle of the torus that maximises the observed emission area of the torus whilst still obscuring the central engine , consistent with the scheme described by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "q1131 + 16 has a remarkable spectrum which displays a multitude of fhils of relatively high equivalent width , as well as the more common emission lines expected of an agn spectrum .",
    "an in - depth study of the spectrum of q1131 + 16 has revealed :    * emission line ratios for the fhil region that are consistent with high densities ( 10@xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 10@xmath4 @xmath5 ) and ionisation parameters ( -1.5 @xmath2 log[u ] @xmath2 0 ) ; * similar velocity widths ( fwhm ) for the low and high ionisation lines , and a lack of evidence for substantial velocity shifts of the fhils relative to the galaxy rest frame ; * a small radial distance from the agn for the region emitting the fhils ( 0.30 @xmath2 @xmath12 @xmath2 50 pc ) .    based on the high densities and relatively quiescent kinematics implied by our observations ,",
    "it is likely that the fhils in q1131 + 16 are emitted by the torus wall , with the inner wall on the far side of the torus viewed directly by the observer , but the quasar itself remaining hidden .",
    "this geometry is also consistent with the relatively small radial distance found for the fhil region .",
    "these results demonstrate the potential of the fhils for probing the circum - nuclear obscuring regions in agn .",
