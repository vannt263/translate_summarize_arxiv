    "a transverse ( say along the @xmath0-axis ) @xmath1-polarized spin current flowing in response to an applied ( say along the @xmath2-axis ) electrical field @xmath3 is referred to as the spin hall effect , and @xmath4 is called spin hall conductivity@xcite .",
    "this effect allows for the generation and control of spin currents by purely electrical means , which is a great advantage when operating electronic devices .",
    "physically , the possibility of a non - vanishing @xmath4 is due to the presence of spin - orbit coupling , which in semiconductors may be orders of magnitude larger than in vacuum .",
    "clearly , two key issues are ( i ) how sensitive is the spin hall conductivity to various solid state effects like disorder scattering , electron - electron interaction etc . and ( ii ) how the spin current can actually be detected experimentally .",
    "about the first issue , there is now a consensus that the effect of disorder scattering depends on the form of the spin - orbit coupling . in the case of the two - dimensional electron gas with a rashba type of spin - orbit coupling , arbitrarily",
    "weak disorder leads to the vanishing of the spin hall conductivity in the bulk limit@xcite . concerning the second issue ,",
    "the first experimental observations@xcite of the spin hall effect have been achieved by measuring , optically , the spin polarization accumulated at the lateral edges of an electrically biased wire .",
    "hence , the understanding of the spin hall effect involves the description of boundaries . in order to address the two issues mentioned above , we develop in the following a quasiclassical green function approach for the description of charge and spin degrees of freedom in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "in this section we sketch how to derive the eilenberger equation for the quasiclassical green function in the presence of spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an effective internal magnetic field due to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "for instance , in the rashba case we have @xmath7 .",
    "the green function @xmath8 is a matrix both in keldysh and spin space and obeys the dyson equation @xmath9 @xmath10 a quasiclassical description is possible when the green function depends on the center - of - mass coordinate , @xmath11 , on a much larger scale than on the relative coordinate , @xmath12 . in this situation , by going to the wigner representation @xmath13 and subtracting from eq.([eq3 ] ) its complex conjugate , one obtains a homogeneous equation for @xmath14 @xmath15=\\left[\\sigma , \\check{g}\\right],\\ ] ] where only the center - of - mass time , @xmath16 , appears . on the right - hand - side of eq.([eq5 ] ) we have also introduced the self - energy @xmath17 which takes into account disorder scattering at the level of the self - consistent born approximation . in the spirit of the quasiclassical approximation , we make the following ansatz for @xmath18 @xmath19 where we assume that @xmath20 does not depend on the modulus of @xmath21 but at most on its direction . in this way we have separated the fast variation of the free green function in the relative coordinate @xmath22 from the slow variation of @xmath20 in the center - of - mass",
    "coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "the quasiclassical green function is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . using the ansatz above",
    ", the @xmath27-integration can be done explicitly . by assuming that @xmath28 and @xmath29 we find @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the densities of state of the spin - split bands . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , @xmath33 , and",
    "the function @xmath34 coincides with the @xmath27-integrated green function @xmath35 . in the present case , however",
    ", @xmath36 by inverting eq.([8 ] ) one has @xmath37\\right ] \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ {    \\left ( 1   - \\frac{n_+-n_-}{2n_0}\\hat{\\textbf{b } } \\cdot    { \\boldsymbol \\sigma } \\right ) ,    \\check{g}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where the last approximation , to be used in the following , holds for @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath27-integration of @xmath18 multiplied by a momentum dependent function leads to @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the fermi momenta in the two bands .",
    "to first order in @xmath42 one obtains @xmath43 where @xmath44 . hence the standard procedure to obtain the eilenberger equation for @xmath35 via the @xmath27-integration of eq.([eq5 ] ) yields @xmath45\\big ) = - { \\rm i }",
    "\\left [ \\check \\sigma , \\check g \\right].\\ ] ] eq.([eq12 ] ) holds even for internal fields @xmath46 for which the factorization @xmath28 is not possible , as long as one can assume @xmath47 . for more details",
    "see @xcite .    from the above eilenberger equation the expression for the charge and spin currents",
    "are readily obtained , since the fermi surface average @xmath48 of eq.([eq12 ] ) has the form of a continuity equation @xmath49 where we expanded the green function in charge and spin components , @xmath50 .",
    "for instance , the spin current with spin polarization along the @xmath51 axis reads @xmath52^k,\\ ] ] with @xmath53 .",
    "before considering explicitly the role of the boundaries , it is useful to see how the spin hall effect in the bulk may be analyzed in the present formalism . for a stationary and space independent case the equation for the keldysh component can be written in the following way ( @xmath54 ) @xmath55 in the above we have introduced the mean free path @xmath56 .",
    "the presence of the electric field , along the @xmath57 axis , is accounted for by the source term @xmath58 @xmath59,\\ ] ] which has been introduced in the eilenberger equation by exploiting the gauge invariance in the derivative terms . in the above",
    "@xmath60 is the fermi function .",
    "notice that spin - charge coupling effects arise at the order of @xmath61 . from the angular average of eq.([18 ] )",
    "one observes immediately that @xmath62 , i.e. no spin current with polarization along @xmath63 flows in the system .",
    "it is also instructive to first express @xmath64 in terms of the angle - averaged quantity @xmath65 and then multiply by @xmath66 and take the angular average .",
    "the spin current reads then @xmath67 when comparing to a calculation of the spin - hall conductivity within the standard kubo - formula approach , one realizes that the first term in square brackets corresponds to the simple bubble diagram , while the second term accounts for vertex corrections due to the spin - dependent part of the velocity operator .",
    "this second term is related to a voltage induced spin polarization in @xmath68 direction that was first obtained by edelstein @xcite , @xmath69 .    in summary",
    ", we find that under the very special conditions we considered here the spin - hall current is zero .",
    "we started from the rashba hamiltonian , that has a linear - in - momentum spin orbit coupling , we assumed that elastic scattering is spin - conserving , and finally we considered the stationary solution in the bulk of the two - dimensional electron system so that the spin density neither depends on space nor time .",
    "relaxing one or more of these conditions finite spin - hall currents are expected .",
    "the derivation of the boundary conditions for the quasiclassical green function is a delicate task , due to the fact that the boundary potential typically varies on a microscopic length scale which is shorter than the quasiclassical _ resolution_. therefore one must include the boundary effect in the very process of the derivation of the eilenberger equation .",
    "this is especially important for interfaces between two different materials , where transport occurs through a tunnel junction or a point contact .",
    "often a boundary with vacuum is simpler to describe since one couples only one incoming with one outgoing channel . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , the non - conservation of spin and in particular the beam splitting ,",
    "i.e. , one incoming channel with direction @xmath70 can be scattered into two outgoing channels @xmath71 , makes the problem more difficult and there is not yet a complete derivation of boundary conditions for the quasiclassical green function .    in the following we limit to two special types of boundary conditions and discuss their role as far as spin relaxation and the spin hall effect are concerned@xcite .",
    "the first type of boundary conditions requires spin conservation , i.e. the spin currents normal to the interface are zero .",
    "we refer to them in the following as _ hard - wall _ boundary conditions , ( see also @xcite ) . for smooth confining potential it has been pointed out , that specular scattering involves some spin rotation in such a way to keep the scattered particle in the eigenstate of the incoming one @xcite .",
    "we refer to this situation as _ soft - wall _ boundary conditions",
    ".    the matching condition for the quasiclassical green function can be obtained following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and reads @xmath72 where the matrix @xmath73 describes the scattering at the boundary .    to illustrate the role of boundaries , we consider the diffusive limit where a detailed analytical treatment is possible and which is also relevant for actual experiments .",
    "orientation of the boundary and the electric field.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we assume that our two - dimensional electron gas is limited to the half - space @xmath74 and that there is a uniform electric field along the @xmath75 direction , see fig .",
    "since the system is translational invariant along the @xmath75 direction , we consider only space dependence with respect to the @xmath76 direction .",
    "the diffusion equation reads @xmath77 with @xmath78 , @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the bulk spin polarization in the presence of an electric field , mentioned at the end of the previous section . a general solution of the diffusion equations ( [ 23]-[26 ] )",
    "can be found in the form @xmath83 where a static solution requires @xmath84 . in the absence of electric field ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) , as in optical spin excitation experiments ,",
    "the solution with longest lifetime has a finite wave vector in contrast to standard diffusion .",
    "the presence of boundaries does affect this result .",
    "with hard - wall boundary conditions @xmath86 where @xmath87 is in the @xmath0-direction , the mode with longest lifetime is localized at the boundary . with soft - wall boundary conditions",
    ", one has @xmath88 while the @xmath1-component of the spin is still conserved and therefore eq .  ( [ 30 ] ) remains valid .",
    "due to the decoupling , at the boundary , of the three spin components , the mode with longest lifetime is no longer confined to the boundary and has @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 with @xmath92 ( as in the bulk ) , where @xmath93 is the spin diffusion length . although the two types of boundary conditions have a different effect in a time - dependent optical spin - relaxation experiment , both imply that , in the absence of an electrical field , the only static solution of the diffusion equation is with vanishing polarization ( see ref.@xcite for further details ) .",
    "the presence of an electric field does not change this result provided the polarization in the @xmath76 direction is replaced by the difference @xmath94 , which enters both the diffusion equations ( [ 23]-[26 ] ) and the boundary conditions ( [ 28]-[31 ] ) .",
    "hence , in the presence of an electric field , the only static solution has @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , the second condition in ( [ 31 ] ) means that , with soft - wall boundary conditions and at the level of diffusive accuracy , the time - dependent approach to the static solution becomes infinitely fast at the boundary , in contrast to what happens in the bulk where relaxation occurs in a finite time .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of numerical results for both spin hall effect and spin accumulation in finite systems . in the following we consider the rashba hamiltonian on a rectangular strip of length @xmath98 and width @xmath99 which is connected to reservoirs at @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we impose soft - wall boundary conditions at @xmath102 and @xmath103 . at @xmath104 the electrical field @xmath105",
    "is applied in @xmath106direction . in order to solve the time - dependent eilenberger equation ( [ eq12 ] )",

    "our algorithm is exact to order @xmath109 and @xmath110 and yields stable solutions for arbitrary long times provided @xmath108 is chosen small enough .",
