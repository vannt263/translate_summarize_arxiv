    "recently , hoava proposed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) a model for quantum gravity which is power - counting renormalizable and hence potentially ultra - violet ( uv ) complete . the model is based on a scaling symmetry which treats space and time differently .",
    "hence , the model explicitly breaks lorentz ( and hence also general coordinate ) invariance .",
    "the action chosen by hoava is power - counting renormalizable with respect to the scaling symmetry . for a particular value of one of the coefficients in the lagrangian ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the infrared ( ir ) limit of the action reduces to that of einstein gravity .",
    "since it was proposed hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity , as this model is now called , has attracted a lot of attention ( for a complete list of references , the reader is referred in the recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "we will only mention some papers relevant to our study .",
    "initially , gravitational wave solutions in hl cosmology were studied @xcite .",
    "the first papers on the early universe cosmology of hl gravity are @xcite where it was realized that the analogs of the friedmann equations in hl gravity include a term which scales as dark radiation and contributes negatively to the energy density .",
    "thus , it is possible in principle to obtain a nonsingular cosmological evolution with the big bang of standard and inflationary cosmology replaced by a bounce . in this context",
    ", it becomes possible @xcite to provide a realization of the ",
    "matter bounce \" alternative @xcite to cosmological inflation for explaining the origin of an almost scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
    "as realized originally in @xcite the different ultraviolet behavior of the theory might provide an alternative to cosmological inflation for solving the problems of standard cosmology such as the horizon and flatness problems @xcite .",
    "the specific uv scaling of hl gravity could change the usual arguments for the origin of the scale - invariance of cosmological perturbations in inflationary cosmology , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dominant uv terms in the action may lead to the possibility of obtaining a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations in the expanding phase of hl cosmology without inflation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . to substantiate these conclusions , however , a careful analysis of the theory of cosmological perturbations in hl gravity",
    "is required , and this is the topic of the current paper .    a possibly more important reason to study cosmological perturbations in hl gravity are basic consistency issues of hl gravity itself . for a particular value of one of the parameters in the hl action , namely @xmath1 , the theory has its ir fixed point the action of gr .",
    "hl gravity has the same dynamical degrees of freedom as general relativity ( gr ) , but it does not have the complete diffeomorphism invariance of gr .",
    "spatial diffeomorphisms are still a symmetry , but space - dependent time reparameterizations are no longer allowed .",
    "thus , one loses one out of the four gauge modes of gr , and hence one extra physical mode is expected survive .",
    "this fact was already pointed out in @xcite and has been further discussed in @xcite .",
    "this extra physical mode , if dynamical , would lead to severe problems for hl gravity , since no effects of extra gravitational degrees of freedom have been observed , and since there are stringent limits on the presence of such degrees of freedom . in @xcite ,",
    "cosmological fluctuations in the absence of matter were considered .",
    "a new physical scalar gravitational mode was found . in the limit @xmath1 , this mode was claimed to be non - dynamical @xcite , although the constraint equation in both @xcite and @xcite showed a singularity in this limit .",
    "perturbations in the presence of matter were very recently considered in @xcite , where it was claimed that the extra gravitational degree of freedom is physical and becomes strongly coupled in the limit @xmath1 in which gr is to be recovered .",
    "these differing claims form our second motivation to perform a careful study of cosmological perturbations in the presence of matter in hl gravity .",
    "it is crucial to perturb about a dynamical friedmann universe as opposed to perturbing about minkowski space - time .",
    "our work builds on the paper @xcite in which the groundwork for the present study was provided .",
    "we start with the general metric including scalar metric fluctuations .",
    "we use the spatial diffeomorphism invariance to choose a gauge in which the spatial metric is diagonal ( we focus on the scalar metric fluctuations ) . making use of the perturbed constraint equations ,",
    "we determine the action for the remaining degrees of freedom of the cosmological perturbations . at this stage",
    "there are indeed two apparent physical degrees of freedom present . after expressing the action in terms of the usual sasaki - mukhanov variable @xcite ,",
    "the variable in terms of which the action for cosmological perturbations has canonical kinetic term , we find that the extra degree of freedom for scalar metric fluctuations is non - dynamical . in particular , there is no strong coupling problem for the fluctuations : consistently including cosmological expansion regulates the divergence found in @xcite . in the case of cosmological perturbations",
    ", the absence of new dynamical degrees of freedom holds for any value of @xmath2 , whereas for gravitational waves our analysis only covers the case @xmath1 , the most interesting case .",
    "the action for cosmological perturbations derived in this paper allows us to study the spectrum of curvature fluctuations in hl gravity .",
    "if the potential term in the hoava action is taken to be of  detailed balance \" form , we find a cancellation of the leading uv terms in the action .",
    "thus , unlike what happens in the case of hl matter on a fixed background , the initial spectrum of fluctuations is not scale - independent .",
    "scale invariance of the fluctuations in the uv region is maintained if we add terms which break the detailed balance condition .",
    "more generally , we study ways of obtaining a scale - invariant spectrum during the course of cosmological evolution .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we begin with a brief review of hl gravity . in section 3",
    "we discuss cosmological perturbations and show that no strong coupling problem arises . in section 4 , we compute the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations and discuss applications to inflationary cosmology .",
    "the final section contains a discussion and conclusions .",

    "higher order contributions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be eliminated making use of the equations of motion .",

    "hence , the strong coupling problem discussed recently in @xcite is not present in linear cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "let us discuss this result , a result which holds for any value of @xmath2 .",
    "the symmetry group of hoava - lifshitz gravity is that of  foliation - preserving \" diffeomorphisms , which is smaller than the full diffeomorphism group of gr .",
    "thus , one may naively expect that with smaller symmetry , we are left with less gauge artifacts and more physical modes . in particular , it was argued that there was an additional scalar dynamical degree of freedom in hoava theory , arising from the gravity sector itself .",
    "this sounds very different from the situation in gr , where gravity has only two physical degrees from freedom  the two polarization states of gravitational waves . according to the standard treatment of cosmological perturbation theory in gr",
    ", the quantum perturbations of the scalar sector are expected to be generated by scalar matter fields . in this case , if there is no matter , all perturbation modes are gauge artifacts .",
    "thus , if there is indeed one additional scalar dynamical degree of freedom from gravity itself in hoava theory , our traditional picture of cosmological perturbation would not apply .",
    "in fact , the extra dynamical degree of freedom would lead to serious problems for the theory , as stressed in @xcite .",
    "however , in this work , a detailed study of the perturbation theory shows that there is no additional dynamical scalar degree of freedom at all , when perturbations in the presence of matter are found by consistently expanding around the frw metric and not around the flat minkoswki one .",
    "furthermore , another point is that , in hoava s original formulation of the theory , the lapse function @xmath4 was restricted to being a function of time only @xmath9 , where the corresponding hamiltonian becomes non - local . in this work ,",
    "we relax this restriction . by assuming @xmath80 and starting from the most general expansion of the action",
    ", we see that the apparent additional degree of freedom is non - dynamical .",
    "is there a new dynamical degree of freedom in the absence of matter ?",
    "let us take the limit of our equations when @xmath81 and the energy density of matter tend to zero .",
    "since the coefficient of the kinetic term @xmath82 is proportional to the background scalar - field value @xmath83 ( see appendix [ app_coeff_2 ] ) , @xmath65 .",
    "thus if there is no matter field , all perturbation modes become non - dynamical , which is exactly the case in gr . however , the limit we are discussing is singular unless @xmath1 because if @xmath84 one of the coefficients in the action ( the @xmath85 coefficient ) blows up .",
    "thus , our work also shows that in the case @xmath1 , the case in which the action of hl gravity reduces to that of gr in the ir limit , there are no extra gravitational degrees of freedom in the vacuum .",
    "this result is in agreement with the conclusions in @xcite , where a scalar degree of freedom in the gravity sector was identified for @xmath84 , and where it was shown that this mode becomes non - dynamical when @xmath1 .",
    "our conclusions also agree with the recent analysis of @xcite .",
    "the extra scalar gravitational degree of freedom in the vacuum sector of the theory was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "that paper shows that there is a singularity for @xmath1 which is agreement with our conclusion that for this choice of @xmath2 there are no new gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) it was pointed out that a scalar field with hoava - lifshitz form ( [ scalar_action ] ) will obtain a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological fluctuations , and it was then argued that a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations may similarly result independent of the equation of state of the background .",
    "this result follows from the fact that the action contains terms with six space derivatives .",
    "these terms dominate in the uv and yield a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "in cosmology we are interested in the power spectrum of the induced curvature fluctuations .",
    "the formalism we established in the previous section now allows us to calculate this spectrum .",
    "we will show that for the gravitational potential ( [ dbalance ] ) of detailed balance form , the terms with six spatial derivatives cancel in the action for cosmological fluctuations .",
    "this happens independently of the detailed form of the coefficients of the higher derivative terms in the matter action .",
    "the reason for this result is that the terms in the gravitational action with six spatial derivatives ( the terms involving the constant @xmath17 ) do not enter the action for cosmological perturbations . if we add terms to the action consistent with power counting renormalizability which break the detailed balance condition , terms with six spatial derivatives in the action for cosmological perturbations will survive .",
    "if we keep the detailed balance condition on the potential , then the leading terms in the uv contain four spatial derivatives .",
    "thus , the initial power spectrum of curvature fluctuations is not scale - invariant .",
    "thus , scale - invariance of the late time power spectrum will only arise for specific background evolutions .",
    "e.g. for inflationary expansion ( as discussed later in this section ) or for a matter bounce @xcite background . if we drop the detailed balance condition , then an initially scale - invariant curvature power spectrum results .",
    "the action ( [ 2nd_action_zeta_only ] ) for a gravitational potential satisfying the detailed balance condition has the general structure : @xmath86 = \\int dt d^3x\\ , a^3 { \\left (   \\gamma\\ , \\dot{\\zeta}^2 - \\omega\\ ,          \\zeta^2           \\right ) } \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath87 where the @xmath75 s are defined in ( [ gamma ] ) . in order to write the action ( [ general_stru ] ) in canonical form",

    "note that the above result should be understood in momentum space , that is we must make the replacement @xmath93 .",
    "the classical equation of motion for the canonically - normalized variable @xmath94 is simply @xmath95 with @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are defined in ( [ gamma_omega ] ) and the variously introduced parameters can be found in appendix [ app_coeff_2 ] . we emphasize that in deriving the equation of motion ( [ master_equation])-([omega ] ) , no approximation ( beyond the restriction to linear perturbation theory ) has been made and that thus the equation is exact .",
    "one can use ( [ master_equation])-([omega ] ) as the starting point of a detailed investigation of the spectrum of scalar metric perturbations in hoava - lifshitz theory .    in the following",
    ", we shall first investigate the uv limit of the above equations in a general background , and then study the evolution in an inflationary background .",
    "to study the perturbations in the uv limit , i.e. for @xmath99 , we consider the terms with highest power of @xmath100 in the equation of motion for the fluctuations .",
    "first , we note that the leading terms in the @xmath75 s are @xmath101 where the @xmath68 sign means that we are writing down only the leading term in the uv limit ( but with the exact value of its coefficient ) .    inserting the coefficients ( see appendix [ app_coeff_2 ] ) : @xmath102 we find that 0 . in other words , the @xmath103 term in @xmath98 , which could be naively expected to arise in hoava - lifshitz theory based on the terms in the lagrangian ,",

    "the above cancellation of the @xmath103 term is not an accident .",
    "one can prove that even for more general high order derivative terms in the scalar field lagrangian , the above cancellation happens . to show that",

    "if one assumes that there are terms such as @xmath111 instead of @xmath112 in the scalar field lagrangian , then the above proof is no longer valid .",
    "it is then possible to generate scale invariant perturbations for a general background in this case .",

    "fluctuations obeying a modified dispersion relation very much like the one we have obtained above was studied in @xcite . however , in @xcite , the modified dispersion relation was not derived from any action principle but simply postulated .",
    "we have shown here that hl gravity yields a specific modified dispersion relation for scalar metric fluctuations .",
    "we will return to this point in a followup paper @xcite .",
    "note that in the case @xmath8 , the case in which the ir limit of hl gravity yields the einstein action , @xmath121 and thus the @xmath122 term in the equation of motion for the curvature fluctuations also vanishes .",

    "the figure also shows for comparison the power spectrum obtained with the standard gr mode function u_k ( ) = e^i ( + ) h_^(1)(-c_s k )  , which describes the fluctuation of a massive light scalar field in de sitter space - time .",

    "in one hubble time , the variation of @xmath60 is at most as large as the slow roll parameters .",
    "it is still possible for @xmath60 to receive @xmath148 corrections during about 60 e - folds of inflation .",
    "another possible contribution to @xmath60 on super hubble scales is the uv - ir transition .",
    "as the uv - ir transition happens at @xmath149 e - folds , it may also yield a @xmath149 contribution to @xmath60 .",
    "applications of the equation of motion for cosmological fluctuations in hl gravity to non - inflationary backgrounds will be left to a followup paper @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the ir limit behavior of perturbations as an important consistency check of perturbation theory in hoava gravity . in the ir limit ( @xmath150 ) , ( [ master_equation])-([omega ] ) takes the form @xmath151 where the expressions for @xmath152 and @xmath153 can be found in appendix [ appsec_cs_mass_ir ] .",

    ", in the ir limit , hoava theory reduces to gr with the following parameters : @xmath156 thus , setting the speed of light @xmath157 in the ir to @xmath158 corresponds to choosing @xmath159 in hoava theory . with this value of @xmath160 , from ( [ app_tilde_cs ] )",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath161 which is what we expected .",

    "one can check that when one further takes @xmath8 , we have @xmath163 , and @xmath162 is suppressed by slow roll parameters .",
    "so in the @xmath164 case in the ir limit , the perturbation theory completely returns to gr up to the leading order of slow roll approximation .",
    "this is a consistency check for our calculation .    to summarize",
    ", we have found several cases in which the perturbation equation takes the same form as that in gr : ( 1 ) in the uv limit with @xmath8 . in this case , the equation of motion has the same form with that in gr . however , the coefficients are different .",
    "( 2 ) in the ir limit with arbitrary @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", the equation of motion is the same with that in gr up to leading order in slow roll approximation .",
    "( 3 ) in the ir limit with @xmath8 . in this case ,",
    "the equation of motion should completely reduced to gr .",
    "in this paper we have studied the theory of linearized cosmological perturbations in hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity . in this study , it is important to expand about a dynamical background since the presence of matter implies that the average energy density does not vanish .",
    "we have found that the extra degree of freedom which could be expected to arise because of the reduced symmetry of hl gravity is in fact not dynamical .",
    "this conclusion holds for any value of @xmath2 . taking the flat space - time limit of our analysis",
    ", we can also show the absence of any new dynamical scalar metric degree of freedom in the absence of matter . our limiting procedure , however , only works in the special case @xmath1 , the case in which the hl gravitational action flows to the action of general relativity ( gr ) in the infrared .",
    "we thus do not see any evidence of the  strong coupling problem \" mentioned in @xcite .    starting from the most general metric including scalar cosmological perturbations , we have worked out the quadratic action for cosmological perturbations .",
    "it turns out that the distinguished dynamical variable for fluctuations is the usual sasaki - mukhanov variable . in terms of this variable , the kinetic terms in the action",
    "has canonical form .",
    "the second metric variable enters the action without kinetic term and is hence not a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "based on the action for cosmological perturbations , we can compute the spectrum of these fluctuations .",
    "rather surprisingly it turns out that the terms in the equation of motion for these fluctuations containing six spatial derivatives vanish if the potential term in the hl gravitational action is of detailed balance form .",
    "it is the presence of these terms which leads to the scale - invariance of the spectrum of hl matter @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that the spectrum of cosmological perturbations is not scale - invariant in hl cosmology ( with potential satisfying the detailed balance form ) , unlike the spectrum of spectator matter field fluctuations . however , the fact that spectator hl matter fields acquire a scale - invariant spectrum will likely make it possible to use the curvaton mechanism @xcite to induce scale - invariant fluctuations in hl cosmology independent of the expansion rate of space .    if the gravitational action is not of detailed balance form ( and this seems to be the preferred case @xcite if the ir limit of the theory is really to reproduce einstein gravity ) , then the @xmath103 terms in the action for cosmological fluctuations will persist , making it possible to have a scale - invariant initial spectrum of adiabatic cosmological perturbations along the lines suggested by @xcite .",
    "we would like to warn the reader that hoava - lifshitz gravity faces many challenges before it can be declared as a viable candidate theory for quantum gravity ( see @xcite for some potential problems ) .",
    "we have only addressed one of these problems - the strong coupling problem for additional fluctuation modes , a problem which has been considered fatal for the theory - and shown that in fact does not arise .",
    "other potential problems remain to be resolved .",
    "if they can be successfully resolved , then it becomes of great interest to explore applications of the equations of cosmological perturbations which we have derived here to non - inflationary backgrounds .",
