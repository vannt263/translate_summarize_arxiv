    "how does the complexity of nuclear physics arise from the relatively simple qcd lagrangian ? of the open questions in nuclear structure , this is one of the broadest and most fundamental .",
    "the long - range goal of nuclear - structure theory is indeed to calculate the properties of finite nuclei starting from the strong - interaction physics of qcd .",
    "although this goal is still several years away , a confluence of nearly parallel conceptual and computational developments is stirring unprecedented excitement about our ability to reach it .",
    "tremendous progress has been made in the last decade @xcite in our understanding of how nuclear structure arises from the properties of the interactions among nucleons inside a nucleus , even though these interactions are often modeled only in terms of _ ad hoc _ potentials . in the previous twenty years",
    "a number of many - body techniques has been developed for exactly solving the nuclear few - body problem @xcite .",
    "the application of these approaches to nuclei ranging in mass from @xmath0 to @xmath1 has clearly demonstrated how the structure of these light nuclei , _",
    "i.e. , _ binding energies , excitation spectra , electromagnetic moments , _ etc . , _ arise directly from the properties of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) , smaller three - nucleon ( nnn ) , and perhaps some tiny four - nucleon ( nnnn ) interactions .",
    "one of the most tantalizing current problems is how to extend the many - body approaches for light nuclei to medium- and heavy - mass systems .",
    "independently , a framework has been developed based on effective field theories @xcite to construct nuclear potentials that respect the symmetry pattern of qcd and produce observables in a systematic and controlled expansion in powers of momentum .",
    "these ingredients restrict the shape of nuclear interactions , particularly in the range of pion exchange , and encapsulate the complicated short - range physics into a number of `` low - energy constants '' .",
    "now , the first results are emerging @xcite , where the low - energy constants , so far simply fitted to data , can be calculated in full lattice qcd simulations . how can one link these results to nuclear properties ?    in this paper",
    "we map some of the landmarks and crucial crossings in the long road from qcd to nuclear structure .",
    "the general goal of microscopic nuclear - structure theory is to begin with the free inter - nucleon interaction and determine , using many - body quantum mechanics , the properties of finite nuclei . in principle , one would like to solve the many - body schrdinger equation for all @xmath2 nucleons , @xmath3 in the `` full '' hilbert space @xmath4 . here",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath5 where the first term involves the kinetic energies @xmath6 and the subsequent terms , the potentials among an increasing number of nucleons .",
    "it used to be assumed that only accurate nn interactions were required , although evidence has now accumulated for the need for nnn interactions @xcite ( and perhaps nnnn interactions ) .",
    "relativistic effects do not play a significant role in understanding low - energy nuclear structure , and can be included as corrections around the non - relativistic limit .    in general , eq .  ( [ eq : fullschr ] ) can not be solved in the full hilbert space @xmath4 , because of the infinite number of configurations , so the problem must be truncated to a smaller hilbert space @xmath7 of dimension @xmath8 ( called the shell - model basis space or simply the model space ) . because the full space has been truncated , full space operators can not be used , but must be replaced with effective operators appropriate for the given size of the model space . in this case , @xmath9 must be replace by the effective hamiltonian @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a projection operator from @xmath4 into @xmath7 , and the @xmath14 are a subset of dimension @xmath8 of the _ exact _ eigenvalues in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullschr ] ) .",
    "the projections @xmath15 are usually not orthogonal , so one must construct the biorthogonals @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 using the biorthogonals , one can easily obtain the @xmath10 that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : effschr ] ) , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath18 it should be noted that @xmath10 will usually be non - hermitian , because of the non - orthogonality of the @xmath19 .",
    "all other physical operators relevant to the nuclear system being investigated , _",
    "e.g. _ , the rms radius operator , the electromagnetic - moment operators , the transition operators , _ etc . _",
    ", must be renormalized in a similar manner for use in the given model space .    in heavy nuclei ,",
    "a drastic projection is needed in the standard nuclear shell model ( snsm ) , consisting of an inert , closed - shell core and a few valence nucleons .",
    "the theoretical construction of snsm effective interactions and operators , both empirically and microscopically , has an extremely long and large history in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the microscopic approach has been more - or - less unsuccessful due to problems connected with the convergence of the perturbation - theory expansion for the effective operators and because of the complexity of the calculations .",
    "a response to these difficulties was found in the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite , in which all @xmath2 nucleons in the nucleus are active . in its usual formulation ,",
    "the ncsm employs a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) single - particle basis of frequency @xmath20 , and nucleons are allowed to share a maximum number @xmath21 of oscillator quanta ( the maximum principal quantum number of the wave functions ) above the minimum - energy configurations .",
    "it is important to include all configurations up to some total energy .",
    "this guarantees that all spurious center - of - mass components will be projected from the final wave functions , when using the lawson procedure @xcite .",
    "the need for effective interactions and operators , in order to calculate nuclear properties , exists whether one is performing snsm or ncsm calculations .",
    "however , the physical nature of the required effective operators will be quite different in the two cases . in the simpler ncsm ,",
    "it involves only unitary transformations based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : trunschr ] ) @xcite .",
    "although the determination of the effective operators for ncsm calculations is more straightforward , the generated effective operators are still dependent upon the nature of the inter - nucleon interactions employed in the calculations @xcite , a low - body ( usually only two - body ) cluster approximation , and the size of the model space .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to find a better method for calculating these ncsm effective operators , which is not potential dependent , yet is directly related to the underlying qcd symmetries and can always be employed in small model spaces .",
    "the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) emerged in the late 1970s @xcite from the realization that , because in a quantum field theory any physics problem is a many - body problem , one _ never _ has access to the `` full '' hilbert space @xmath4 .",
    "it is always necessary to truncate the hilbert space so as to exclude states associated with energies beyond those we can confidently access experimentally and theoretically .",
    "this paradigm shift implies that interactions are only defined in the context of a model space : the platonic concept of `` the '' hamiltonian is not particularly useful in physics .",
    "what is needed is a method to construct effective interactions and operators whether or not the underlying , higher - energy physics is known . since relativistic quantum effects of arbitrary complexity exist unless they are forbidden by a symmetry , any effective interaction or operator with assumed symmetries should be included .",
    "still , the intrinsic connection between hamiltonian and model space would be problematic without a way to ensure that the arbitrariness in the choice of model space does not contaminate observables .",
    "the projector @xmath13 always contains at least one dimensionful parameter , the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath22 , for definiteness taken here to be a momentum .",
    "one thus requires that the hamiltonian @xmath10 depend on @xmath22 in such a way that observables at momenta @xmath23 are independent of how @xmath13 is chosen , and in particular , independent of @xmath22 .",
    "this is termed renormalization - group ( rg ) invariance .",
    "nuclear physics is a great arena for these ideas , because it is not easy to find solutions for qcd at momenta @xmath24 gev .",
    "yet we know the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "in particular , chiral symmetry plays an important role , even at low energies , thanks to the appearance of light pions , due to spontaneous and small explicit breaking .",
    "it is , thus , not difficult to write the most general hamiltonian with the appropriate degrees of freedom and symmetries @xcite , which is a generalization to systems with more than one nucleon of the lagrangian used in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "interactions among nucleons consist of pion exchanges and contact interactions , which subsume short - range dynamics ( say , exchange of heavier mesons ) . at very low energies",
    "even pion exchange can be treated as short ranged , leaving only contact interactions in the theory .",
    "the real challenge is ordering the infinite number of interactions so that observables can be calculated in an expansion in powers of @xmath25 .",
    "a guide is provided by the rg : a truncation of this expansion at any given order must respect rg invariance except for small errors contained in higher orders .",
    "this approach had mostly been applied in particle physics to systems where unitarity could be accounted for perturbatively . in nuclear physics , the leading order ( lo ) must contain non - perturbative physics to generate nuclear bound states and resonances . only subleading - order corrections , if truly corrections , should be treated in perturbation theory .",
    "most applications of eft in nuclear physics have been carried out using a continuum free - particle basis @xcite .",
    "this facilitates the study of reactions , in addition to structure , but unfortunately , with foreseeable computational resources , is limited to @xmath26 . to increase @xmath2 , we need to limit the number of accessible one - body states by introducing an additional , infrared ( ir ) momentum cutoff @xmath27 , which discretizes momentum .",
    "this is a traditional method in qcd itself , where simulations are carried out on lattices , and in addition to an uv cutoff @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the lattice spacing , there is also an ir cutoff @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the lattice size .",
    "lattice regularization can be , and has been , applied to nuclear eft as well @xcite , where it is particularly suited to the study of nuclear matter at finite temperature .",
    "the successes of the snsm suggest , however , that formulating the nuclear eft in an ho basis might be an efficient way to reach larger , finite nuclei .",
    "an uv cutoff equivalent to the cutoff used in a free - particle basis can be defined in an ho basis : if @xmath32 is the two - body reduced mass , @xmath33 is the momentum associated with the energy of the highest ho shell included explicitly in the two - body system in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the ho frequency @xmath20 defines an additional ir cutoff @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the ho length , which plays a role analogous to the box size @xmath31 in a lattice discretization @xcite .",
    "eft in an ho basis is essentially the ncsm formulated directly within the model space : eft provides the form of the effective interactions and operators needed in the ncsm .",
    "since ncsm is a full diagonalization approach in a basis constructed with ho wave functions , each model space is determined by two parameters : @xmath21 and @xmath20 , or alternatively , @xmath22 and @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , all low - energy constants are functions of these two parameters . as in any eft",
    ", they need to be determined either from some experimental data or , eventually , from qcd itself .",
    "enormous progress in lattice qcd has already produced @xcite nn scattering lengths , _ albeit _ at unphysical values of the pion mass .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the next few years will see scattering lengths at lower pion masses , effective ranges , other nn quantities , and perhaps even observables involving more nucleons .",
    "a key aspect of this work is the use of lscher s formula @xcite , where the energy levels inside a box are linked to scattering parameters .",
    "the drawback of formulating the eft in an ho basis is that the connection to scattering states becomes less obvious than when using a continuum free - particle basis . as we show in the rest of this paper , this is not an impassable roadblock , for two reasons .",
    "first , one can always determine the low - energy constants from bound - state data ( _ e.g. , _ binding energies ) .",
    "we illustrate the method in sec .",
    "[ lightnuclei ] , where we use data from a few bound states to fix the low - energy constants and then many - body theory in the form of the ncsm to calculate properties of larger systems @xcite .",
    "it is true , however , that as the eft order increases , the low - energy constants multiply , and it is desirable to determine them using the more abundant scattering ( experimental or lattice ) data .",
    "second , it _ is _ possible to connect the energies inside an ho well to scattering parameters in a way @xcite very similar to lscher s formula .",
    "we show how this can be done in sec .",
    "[ atoms ] in the simpler problem of spin-1/2 fermions without isospin @xcite , which is relevant for trapped two - state atoms close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "the first direct application of eft principles to the derivation of effective interactions in finite ncsm model spaces was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "we have opted for a theory without explicit pions for two reasons : ( i ) for very - low - energy processes ( involving momenta less that the pion mass ) the formalism becomes very simple , and ( ii ) the same techniques would be readily applicable to the pionful eft .    in pionless eft at lo ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effschr ] ) can be written as a sum of the relative kinetic energy , two contact interactions in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 nn channels , with corresponding parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and a contact three - body interaction in the @xmath40 nnn channel , with parameter @xmath41 : @xmath42}(\\vec p_i-\\vec p_j)^2 + c_0 ^ 1 \\sum_{[i < j]^1}\\delta(\\vec r_i-\\vec r_j ) + c_0 ^ 0 \\sum_{[i <",

    "unlike in the conventional ncsm approach based on a unitary transformation , in this approach the interaction in each model space has the same structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , matrix elements of the contact two- and three - body interactions .",
    "only the coupling constants differ in each model space ; they depend on @xmath21 and @xmath20 : @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the three coupling constants are fixed for each model space so that three observables , the deuteron , triton , and @xmath49he binding energies , are simultaneously reproduced . with the hamiltonian ,",
    "thus , defined , we have investigated the energy of the first @xmath50 excited state of @xmath49he as well as the @xmath51li ground - state energy .    because the errors associated with the terms neglected in the lo hamiltonian @xmath10 decrease with increasing the ultraviolet cutoff , large values of @xmath22 are desirable .",
    "while increasing @xmath21 makes the calculation impractical even for a small number of particles , increasing @xmath20 is not a good option either , as this would increase the errors associated with the infrared cutoff .",
    "instead , for fixed @xmath20 , we have calculated the energies of interest in the four- and six - nucleon systems for the maximum @xmath21 we were able to handle , extrapolating to other values of @xmath22 using @xmath52 , an expression motivated by a similar running in the two - body system in the continuum @xcite .",
    "then for fixed @xmath22 , we extrapolate energies to @xmath53 , which eliminates infrared errors , using a quadratic formula . using this approach ,",
    "we have predicted that the energy of the first @xmath50 excited state of @xmath49he is 18.5 mev , in very good agreement ( within 10% ) with the experimental value .",
    "( the agreement can be understood if we consider that this state is very close to the four - nucleon continuum threshold , a regime well within the limits of applicability of the theory . )",
    "a similar analysis for the @xmath51li ground state also produced results within 30% of the experimental level , with an underbinding of about 9 mev .",
    "better results can be obtained if one includes an extra term to the running , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath54 .",
    "while the extra term essentially does not change the result in the four - body system , for @xmath51li the new results overbind the system by only 15% . in fig .",

    "beyond lo ( or even at lo in the theory with pions @xcite ) , the procedure discussed in the previous section to determine low - energy constants becomes impractical : the number of required input observables increases rapidly , and an ever larger number of states in light nuclei is needed to adjust the interaction .",

    "<S> one of the central open problems in nuclear physics is the construction of effective interactions suitable for many - body calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a recently developed approach to this problem , where one starts with an effective field theory containing only fermion fields and formulated directly in a no - core shell - model space . </S>",
