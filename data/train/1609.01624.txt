    "beside simple metallic systems found with b.c.c and f.c.c structures , with few atoms per unit cells , many intermetallic alloys display more or less intricate structures with polytetrahedral type of packing , and possibly a large number of atoms in the unit cell , like in the so - called frank - kasper ( f - k ) phases@xcite . it is standard in that case to focus on the local atomic environments , the canonical @xmath2 cells ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] ) , the case @xmath4 corresponding to a local icosahedral environment .",
    "a long - standing question in quasicrystal studies is to relate the atomic order present in quasicrystalline phases with that of f - k phases , some of which being identified as rational approximants of the former ; dually , these quasicrystalline phases ( close in the phase diagram ) could then be thought as mere quasperiodic generalizations of the periodic f - k phases .",
    "the four main frank - kasper coordination polyhedra ( top figure ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath6 , represented also by their voronoi cells ( lower figures ) . frank - kasper lines ( or disclination lines ) , shown as black lines , start from the center of the coordination polyhedra and run through the black sites , or from the voronoi cell centres and go through hexagonal faces , defining a `` major skeleton '' in the structure . ]",
    "as will be detailed below , f - k structures can also be generated with an atomic decoration procedure applied on top of a plane tiling made of triangles and/or squares , building simple atomic layers .",
    "to go further , one should then understand how the f - k construction rules can be accommodated with an underlying quasiperiodic tiling ; it was therefore natural to investigate how well dodecagonal quasiperiodic tilings , made of squares and ( equilateral ) triangles , can be used as building frames to generate some f - k - like quasicrystalline structures .",
    "this is the main task of the work presented here .",
    "note that such tilings have been used to model dodecagonal quasicrystals found in metallic alloys related to frank - kasper phases @xcite and , more recently , in dendrimeric supramolecular liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "we show here how to produce two types of such structures , which are quasiperiodic in a plane and periodic in the third direction , and containing ( or not ) @xmath6 sites ( sites with 16 neighbours ) .    in a first step ,",
    "we detail the f - k rules for periodic systems .",
    "four parallel atomic layers are disposed with respect to a periodic planar frame made of triangle and squares .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath2 sites and periodic disclinated networks are direct consequences of these rules .    in order to generate quasicrystalline f - k - like structures ,",
    "we then start with a particular tiling with square and triangles , the dodecagonal square - triangle quasiperiodic tiling .",
    "we first recall a standard method to produce the 12-fold symmetric quasiperiodic tiling , the inflation / deflation approach ( see ref @xcite ) , for which we propose a new simplified algorithm .",
    "notice that a standard cut and project approach from a higher dimensional space is also possible , but operationally complex because the acceptance domain ( used to select the tiling points ) has a fractal shape in that case .",
    "we then return to the question of atomic decorations leading to close - packed configurations , and extend the f - k rules to this wider quasiperiodic domain .",
    "a particular such decoration , corresponding to the type of atomic order found in the crystalline f - k @xmath10 phase , was already used by gahler @xcite to model the first dodecagonal quasicrystalline alloys found in ni - cr , v - ni and v - si - ni alloys . notice a slight difference in that case since the underlying quasiperiodic tiling contained thin rhombuses in addition to the square and triangles ( in that case the acceptance domain is a regular dodecagon instead of a fractal shape , making the construction simpler ) .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for further developments . as for the periodic case ,",
    "four atomic layers are generated , with atomic positional order following that of the underlying quasiperiodic tiling , these quasicrystalline atomic layers being then repeated periodically . in the present work , we discuss two different decoration schemes to be applied on the square - triangle quasiperiodic tiling , leading to two types of @xmath9 sites ( in - plane or connecting different planes ) as well as a variable amount of @xmath6 sites .    beside the perfect 12-fold quasiperiodic tiling , a rich set of square - triangle tilings",
    "can also be derived , with either lower ( hexagonal ) symmetry or even forming random tilings . from any such tiling",
    ", an atomic decoration procedure could be applied , locally inspired by the f - k rules , leading to a large set of tetrahedrally close packed ( tcp ) structures . among these generalized structures",
    ", we shall discuss an interesting new set which can interpolate between the f - k @xmath11 phase , whose underlying tiling is a triangular one , and the @xmath12 phase with a square underlying tiling .",
    "this set is periodic along two directions , with , along the third one , a sequence of triangle and square rows which can take any form ( periodic , quasiperiodic , disordered ) .",
    "an explicit quasiperiodic example is described in the appendix .",
    "f - k structures are tetrahedrally close - packed periodic structures , first described by frank and kasper @xcite , and later studied extensively by many authors , among which notably d. and c. shoemaker @xcite .",
    "the atoms occupy ( so - called ) @xmath2 sites , where @xmath3 , the site coordination number , is equal to either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) , and have interpenetrating triangulated coordination polyhedra ; the @xmath2 sites voronoi cells have @xmath13 pentagons ( the @xmath7 voronoi polyhedron is a pentagonal dodecahedron ) and @xmath14 hexagons .    when icosahedral quasicrystals were discovered in intermetallic compounds ,",
    "the large cell structures found nearby in the phase diagram became of parallel interest , as they were now viewed as periodic approximant of the perfect quasicrystalline structure .",
    "the metallurgist community quickly considered that frank - kasper - like phases @xcite or related phases ( like @xmath15-mn or cacu@xmath16 for instance ) would be good models for these large cell periodic structures .",
    "indeed , they already present a high degree of local and medium range icosahedral configurations , like for instance in the bergman structure @xcite .",
    "quite rapidly , decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystalline structures were also discovered and further related to f - k structures .",
    "more recently , dodecagonal quasicrystals have also been found in soft matter systems , like in dendrimeric supramolecular liquid crystals @xcite , a particularly interesting discovery showing that metallic bonding is not a prerequisite for stable quasiperiodic order .",
    "note in addition that f - k phases were also observed in micellar structures @xcite .",
    "-free structures ( left part ) , or with @xmath6 sites ( right part ) , for the three types of tile interface : triangle - triangle ( a , d ) , triangle - square ( b , e ) and square - square ( c , f ) .",
    "let us first describe the left part ( a , b , c ) .",
    "sites located on the secondary layers at height @xmath17 and @xmath18 sit at the tile vertices and are shown in grey .",
    "we aim to discuss the decoration of primary layer ( at height @xmath19 ) with atoms located inside the triangular and/or square prisms formed by secondary layer sites . as explained in the text ,",
    "there are two sets of edges ( marked as dark or light - grey edges ) , with respect to their angular value ( modulo @xmath20 ) . edges of a given triangle will belong to one of the two sets , while adjacent edges of a square will alternate among the two sets .",
    "there are two different primary layer decoration rules ( called rules @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , at the vertical of a triangle of the secondary layer , depending on the triangle colour , and whether the primary layer is at height @xmath23 or @xmath19 .",
    "this point will appear more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : decoz15 ] .",
    "the figure displays rule @xmath21 , on the primary layer at height @xmath19 , with atoms inside triangular prisms ( with the triangles being of light - grey colour ) , or square prisms .",
    "these atoms are shown in blue ( colour on line ) , with the piece of disclination network to which they belong .",
    "they fall in the middle of the triangles , in the middle of the dark grey edges and displaced from the middle of the light grey edges by 1/4 of the square edge length .",
    "rule @xmath22 applies when the triangles have dark edges , in which case the decoration adds atomic sites on top of the edge centres .",
    "sites located on primary layers at height @xmath23 are also shown ( in red with colour on - line ) .",
    "note that these two rules for triangle decoration drive the decoration on top of the squares , with atomic sites on top of dark edges and slightly displaced for the light ones .",
    "sites at height @xmath19 in the triangular prism middle are @xmath9 sites , connected to @xmath8 sites through a triangle - square interface .",
    "sites falling on the dark grey mid - edge are @xmath7 sites .",
    "finally , grey sites on the secondary layers are all @xmath8 sites , connected by vertical disclination lines .",
    "now , for the primary layer at height @xmath23 , the decoration is similar , but with rules @xmath21 and @xmath22 reversed with respect to the edge colouring .",
    "let us turn now to the layer decoration with @xmath6 sites , shown on the right part ( d , e , f ) . as said in the text ,",
    "some edges are now `` double edges '' separating stripes . across these double edges ,",
    "rules @xmath21 and @xmath22 are reversed .",
    "this leads to connecting the disclination lines between two primary layers ( in blue and red on - line ) .",
    "a formerly @xmath9 ( resp . a @xmath8 ) site is turned into a @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "a @xmath9 ) site.,width=453 ]      frank and kasper showed that the structure complexity can be encoded by a network of lines , called by them the `` major skeleton '' , avoiding the @xmath7 sites , and joining the other atomic sites through the voronoi cells hexagonal faces .",
    "the edges of these networks are precisely those edges in the full structure simplicial decomposition sharing six tetrahedral cells . as a whole",
    ", the edge set of a f - k structure is therefore a subtle mixture of edges sharing five tetrahedra , and this network of edges sharing six tetrahedra .",
    "f - k phases provide an intermediate solution for the frustrated problem of sphere packing maximal compactness .",
    "best packing are well known to be given by fcc or hcp packings , with interstices not limited to tetrahedral ones , while a search for a better , but only local , solution would invite to attempt for a maximization of tetrahedral interstices .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that a perfect space tiling by regular tetrahedra is impossible , since the dihedral angle of a regular tetrahedron ( @xmath24 ) is not a submultiple  @xmath25 , although being close to @xmath26 ) : the problem is said to be geometrically frustrated .",
    "icosahedral local order is naturally generated in polytetrahedral packing , but a perfect packing of regular tetrahedra is only possible in a positively curved space @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "a polytetrahedral packing in @xmath28 will necessarily contain ( curvature carrying ) topological defects , like disclination lines , corresponding to regions in space where the local order differs from a perfect icosahedral one .",
    "starting with an edge sharing five tetrahedra , the simplest disclination line along this edge will place six tetrahedra around this edge .",
    "this corresponds to the f - k major skeleton rules , the latter being therefore identified as such a disclination network@xcite .",
    "this network has two types of sites : ( i ) edge sites , made of @xmath8 polyhedra , threaded by the edge through opposite points , and ( ii ) vertex sites , where disclinated edges meet by three at @xmath29 on @xmath9 sites , of by four at a tetrahedral angle on @xmath6 sites .",
    "one can show that these disclination lines can not be interrupted in the structure : they run throughout the volume , and possibly connect to other lines .",
    "one can distinguish several families of frank - kasper phases .",
    "a first main difference refers to whether or not atoms can be gathered into simple planes ( called , in the f - k terminology ,  primary layers \" , tiled with triangles , hexagons or pentagons , and `` secondary layers '' , with squares and/or triangles ) , see for instance @xcite@xcite .",
    "we shall describe here the atomic positions , and disclination network , by focusing on the three types of tile interfaces in the secondary layers , either triangle - triangle , square - square and triangle - square ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : discli_z15_z16 ] ) .    a nice example of a non - layered f - k phase is provided by the bergman structure @xcite , which shows , around symmetrical sites , an interesting nested sequence of clusters with icosahedral symmetry . among the layered f - k phases ,",
    "another criterion distinguishes between principal layers containing only hexagons and triangles ( like @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 phases @xcite ) , and those in which there are also pentagons ( leading to the presence of @xmath6 sites , as discussed below , like in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 laves phases @xcite .",
    "we shall mainly be interested here to extend these f - k layered phases to quasiperiodic order .",

    "the atomic positions on this primary layer at height @xmath19 are vertices of a tiling by hexagons and triangles , with the hexagon centres on top of the atomic positions of the secondary layer at height @xmath17 .",

    "two `` primary '' layers are positionned at height @xmath23 and @xmath19 , and two `` secondary '' layers at height at height @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is convenient , following j. sullivan@xcite , to start by considering a secondary layer , say at height @xmath17 , which is a tiling of squares and/or equilateral triangles ( the above heigths are given in terms of the tiles edge length ) .",
    "this tiling plays a central role since it determines the whole atomic structure , up to a decoration choice that will allow or not the presence of @xmath6 sites .",
    "in both cases , atoms ( or micelles ) are located at the vertices of the tiles in this secondary layer , as well as for the parallel other secondary layer located at height @xmath18 .",

    "those belonging to the two parallel secondary layers sit on the square - triangle tiling vertices .",
    "those on the primary layers eventually form horizontal tilings of triangles and hexagons .    with these decorations rules , many well known f - k phases",

    ", one defines stripes covering the triangle - square tiling , and delimited by edges which we shall call ( and draw as , in the figures ) double edges @xcite .",
    "the rule to follow is that no triangle should have two double edges and no squares two consecutive double edges .",

    "we have seen above that it can be obtained by decoration on top of a triangular tiling , leading to a structure with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites . but this phase can also be generated using the present rule , applied on an underlying square tiling ( in which case only @xmath9 sites are generated accross double edges ) . with @xmath41 infinite in the previous formula ,",

    "the decoration consists first in drawing stripes delimited by double edges , where the decoration rules swap and the disclination networks connect from a layer to another .",
    "this decoration is not unique ; we show here an example with a dense array of concentric stripes .",
    "the drawing does not show the @xmath7 sites on the primary layers and therefore only displays sites on the disclination networks on these layers : the @xmath8 sites , grey , in the secondary layers , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites in the primary layers .",
    "grey sites sites on the secondary layers are either @xmath7 sites if belonging to double edges , or @xmath8 sites on simple edges .",
    "disclination networks are drawn in red ( resp . in blue ) , colour on - line , for the primary layer at height @xmath23 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) .",
    "disclination segments crossing double edges ( and connecting the two primary layers ) appear in purple ( colour on - line ) . ]",
    "let us now describe quasiperiodic structures containing @xmath6 sites . as discussed above in the crystalline case ,",
    "the rule consists in defining stripes delimited by double edges , which form the locus where disclination networks connect between different layers .",
    "but , while simple dense periodic arrays of stripes were easy to define in the former case , this task is more complex here , and there are a priori multiple solutions .",
    "here , we display one such solution which consists in having a dense array of concentric stripes around the tiling centre ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dodecfkz16 ] ) .",
    "triangle - square tilings are known to provide very interesting templates for frank - kasper tetrahedrally close packed structures .",
    "we have given a detailed description of the decoration procedure which connect them , and focused in addition on the resulting disclination network geometry .",
    "two types of decorations are discussed , leading , or not , to structures with @xmath6 sites .",
    "the frank - kasper construction can be generalized to quasicrystalline order , as discussed in the second part of this paper for compact structures based on the 12-fold symmetric triangle - square tiling .",
    "this is quite interesting in view of a renewed interest due to the experimental finding of 12-gonal quasicrystalline soft - matter systems .",
    "we have described how to generate a self - similar such tiling , as well as ( in the appendices ) a related 6-fold symmetric tiling , and a square - triangle tiling which is quasiperiodic in one direction and periodic in the other . in all cases ,",
    "the decorations rules discussed in the periodic case can be used and produce quasicrystalline f - k phases with , as expected , a quasiperiodic disclination network .",
    "it is well known that topological disorder can be introduced in square - triangle tilings , via so - called  zipper moves \" @xcite .",
    "it would certainly be interesting to study these disordered f - k phases more in details    j - f sadoc is pleased to thank m. imperor , a. jaganathan and b. pansu for fruitful discussions    ( a ) square - triangle 6-fold symmetric quasiperiodic tiling , with all dodecagon decoration equally oriented ( first hierarchical step on top of a decorated dodecagon ) .",
    "this tiling has an exact 6-fold symmetry axis .",
    "( b ) acceptance domain for the same tiling but after a third hierarchical step ; the boundary has a fractal shape . ]",
    "in order to construct the above 12-fold symmetric square - triangle tiling , we have applied an iterative decoration procedure inside the dodecagon generated at each step , with a rule to decide among the two possible orientations modulo @xmath71 of the six central triangles .",
    "but we can also decide to decorate these dodecagons with a unique orientation . as a consequence ,",
    "a six - fold symmetric quasiperiodic tiling is generated , as displayed on the figure  [ fig : quasi6fold]-a with one direction choice .",
    "interestingly , the acceptance domain , shown on figure  [ fig : quasi6fold]-b , is less complex than that used for the 12-fold case , but still has a fractal boundary ( whose dimension can be calculated in that case ) .     a tiling by rows of squares and triangles , which is quasiperiodic in the direction perpendicular to the rows .",
    "it is obtained by a substitution rule on two letters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively for rows of squares and triangles , which reads : @xmath74 and @xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath76 in the matrix given in the text . recall that this matrix has been chosen in order to have an equal area covered by both squares and triangles , a characteristics which already rules out periodicity .",
    "the figure corresponds to three iterations starting from a row of triangles and a row of squares , schematized on the left.,width=377 ]",
    "interesting new structures can be defined , which interpolate between the f - k @xmath11 phase , whose underlying tiling is a triangular one , and the @xmath12 phase with a square underlying tiling .",
    "it amounts to have linear rows of squares and of triangles , which alternate with any sequence and relative densities .",
    "this set is periodic along two directions , with , along the third one , a type of order given by the considered sequence , which can take any form ( periodic , quasiperiodic , disordered ) .",
    "we now describe an explicit such square - triangle tiling , periodic in one direction and quasiperiodic in the orthogonal direction , which also shares with the above 12-fold symmetric tiling the characteristics of equal area covered by the squares and the triangles .",
    "we consider a structure made of two types of rows : an infinite row of squares ( with unit edge length ) , labelled @xmath72 , and an infinite row of triangles , of width @xmath77 , labelled @xmath78 .",
    "we define a substitution rule on the two letters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , such that a square row is replaced by @xmath79 square rows and @xmath80 triangle rows , and a triangle row is replaced by @xmath81 square rows and @xmath79 triangle rows .",
    "this is encoded in the following transfer matrix form to compute the vector @xmath82 , with @xmath83 ( resp .",
    "@xmath84 ) the number of square ( resp .",
    "triangle ) rows at the @xmath85 iteration : @xmath86 to the perron root ( @xmath87 ) of this matrix corresponds an eigenvector @xmath88 ; from this , we get an equal area covered by triangles and squares , for any value of the integer @xmath79 , and non - periodicity in the direction orthogonal to rows resulting from the irrationality of @xmath89 .",
    "a simple example is shown figure  [ fig : quasi1d ] corresponding to @xmath76 .",
    "a f - k decoration then leads to a structure which can be viewed as a quasiperiodic mixing of the @xmath12 and the @xmath11 phase .",
    "notice that @xmath90 differs from the above @xmath37 in that it counts row frequencies instead of tile frequencies .",
    "a triangle row contains alternating triangles of opposite directions , and twice as many triangles as squares , per unit row length . taking this into account",
    ", one recovers the same coordination number @xmath66 as for the above 12-fold f - k quasicrystal .",
    "notice that it is also possible , from the rows , to simply define double edges stripes in such a way as to produce @xmath6 sites . in that case , we obtain , using the expression detailed above , an average coordination @xmath91 , quite close to the celebrated value for the coxeter  statistical honeycomb \" @xcite .",
