    "since the late eighties there has been much interest in the study of @xmath0-meson production in @xmath5 and @xmath1 collisions at hadron colliders , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the first measurements were performed more than two decades ago by the ua1 collaboration at the cern @xmath6 collider @xcite operating at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath7 tev .",
    "more recent measurements were made by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the fermilab tevatron running at @xmath8 tev @xcite and 1.96 tev @xcite .",
    "just recently , the cms collaboration at the cern lhc collider published first results for inclusive @xmath9- @xcite , @xmath10- @xcite , and @xmath11-meson @xcite production in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath12 tev .",
    "@xmath9 mesons were reconstructed via their decay @xmath13 followed by @xmath14 , whereas @xmath10 mesons were identified through the observation of @xmath15 final states with the subsequent decays @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the case of @xmath11 mesons ,",
    "the reconstructed final states were generated by the decay chain @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "from all these measurements the differential cross sections @xmath21 and @xmath22 as well as the integrated cross section for @xmath23 gev ( for @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons ) or @xmath24 gev ( for @xmath11 mesons ) were reported .    the general - mass variable - flavor - number ( gm - vfn ) scheme provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of the inclusive production of single heavy - flavored hadrons , combining the fixed - flavor - number ( ffn ) @xcite and zero - mass variable - flavor - number ( zm - vfn ) @xcite schemes , which are valid in complementary kinematic regions , in a unified approach that enjoys the virtues of both schemes and , at the same time , is bare of their flaws .",
    "specifically , it resums large logarithms by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution of nonperturbative fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , guarantees the universality of the latter as in the zm - vfn scheme , and simultaneously retains the mass - dependent terms of the ffn scheme without additional theoretical assumptions .",
    "it was elaborated at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) for photoproduction @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite of charmed hadrons as well as for their production by @xmath3 annihilation @xcite .",
    "it was also applied to obtain predictions for @xmath0-meson hadroproduction @xcite , which could be compared with recent cdf data @xcite .",
    "an earlier implementation of such an interpolating scheme is the so - called fixed - order - next - to - leading - logarithm ( fonll ) approach , in which the conventional cross section in the ffn scheme is linearly combined , with the help of a @xmath4-dependent weight function , with a suitably modified cross section in the zm - vfn scheme implemented with perturbative ffs @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , nonperturbative ffs for the transitions @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is any parton , including @xmath2 and @xmath27 quarks , were extracted at nlo in the @xmath28 factorization scheme with @xmath29 flavors from the scaled - energy ( @xmath30 ) distributions @xmath31 of @xmath32 measured by the aleph @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations at the cern lep1 collider and by the sld collaboration @xcite at the slac slc collider . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , these ffs may be consistently used in our gm - vfn framework .",
    "working at nlo in the gm - vfn scheme with these @xmath0-meson ffs , we found excellent agreement with recent cdf measurements of @xmath21 for @xmath33 @xcite , especially in the upper @xmath4 range , @xmath34 gev @xcite .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we summarize our input choices of pdfs and @xmath0-meson ffs . in sec .  3",
    ", we compare the predictions of the gm - vfn scheme with the cms data from the recent lhc run at @xmath12 tev @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "as pdfs for the proton , we choose one of the most recent parametrizations of the cteq collaboration , set cteq6.6 m @xcite , which provides an improvement over the earlier version cteq6.5 m .",
    "both sets were obtained in the framework of a general - mass scheme using the input values @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 gev , and @xmath37 . in both set , the @xmath2-quark pdf has its starting scale at @xmath38 .",
    "the nonperturbative ffs describing the transition of the @xmath2 and @xmath39 quarks into a @xmath0 meson can be obtained only from experiment . in our earlier work on inclusive @xmath0-meson production at the tevatron @xcite , we constructed such ffs using as input recent precise measurements of the cross section of inclusive @xmath0-meson production in @xmath3 annihilation obtained by the aleph @xcite , opal @xcite , and sld @xcite collaborations .",
    "these data were taken on the @xmath40-boson resonance , so that finite-@xmath41 effects , being of relative order @xmath42 , are strongly suppressed , which means that we are in the asymptotic regime where the gm - vfn scheme is equivalent to the zm - vfn scheme .",
    "the combined fit to the three data sets was performed using the nlo value @xmath43 mev corresponding to @xmath44 , values adopted from ref .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales were chosen to be @xmath45 . in accordance with the chosen pdfs",
    ", the starting scale of the @xmath46 ff was taken to be @xmath38 , while the @xmath47 ffs , where @xmath48 denotes the light quarks including the charm quark , were taken to vanish at @xmath49 .    for fitting the data , we actually employed two different parametrizations for the @xmath50 ff at @xmath38 , namely the peterson ansatz @xcite and the simple power ansatz @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the peterson ansatz led to a very poor fit .",
    "therefore , we shall use in this work only the ffs obtained with the power ansatz , whose parameters at the starting scale are listed in table 1 of ref .",
    "a comparison of the fit performed using this ansatz with the three input data sets may be found in fig .  1 of that reference .",
    "we note that the data from opal and sld included all @xmath0-hadron final states , in particular those with @xmath51 hadrons , while , in the aleph analysis , only final states with identified @xmath52 and @xmath10 mesons were taken into account .",
    "our fit was based on the assumption that the ffs of all @xmath2 hadrons had the same shape .",
    "the branching fraction of @xmath53 was taken equal to that of @xmath54 and fixed to 0.397 . in our calculations for @xmath11-meson production to be presented below , we shall use the same ffs and rescale them by the factor @xmath55 , which uses the up - to - date values for the @xmath53 and @xmath56 branching fractions quoted by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that , in the analysis of the available @xmath3 annihilation data , the charged and neutral @xmath0 mesons were not separated .",
    "furthermore , the charged states @xmath9 and @xmath57 could not be distinguished .",
    "the ffs obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are , therefore , valid for the average of @xmath9 and @xmath57 and , similarly , for the average of @xmath10 and @xmath58",
    ".    the factorization scales related to the initial- and final - state singularities entering the pdfs and ffs , respectively , can in principle be chosen independently .",
    "we checked , however , that when estimating theoretical error bands by varying these scales by factors of 2 up and down , the extreme values are indeed obtained when the initial- and final - state factorization scales are identified .",
    "our default choice of renormalization and factorization scales is @xmath59 .",
    "theoretical uncertainties will be estimated by setting @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and varying @xmath62 and @xmath63 about their default values @xmath64 by factors of 2 up and down , restricting the ratio to the range @xmath65 .",
