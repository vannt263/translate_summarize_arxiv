    "the couplings of leptons and quarks to the z boson are of fundamental importance both in testing the standard model ( sm ) and in searching for , or setting limits on , physics beyond the sm .    the results available in the summer of 1995 @xcite showed some possibly significant differences from the sm expectations in the values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 ; where @xmath6 is the ratio of the z partial width to @xmath7 to the total hadronic width .",
    "these were about 3.1 and 2.4 standard deviations above and below the sm values for @xmath0 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the z@xmath1 vertex is a sensitive probe for new physics arising from vertex corrections .",
    "the above results , in particular those for @xmath0 , gave rise to considerable theoretical speculation on possible physics beyond the sm which could lead to such an increase .",
    "within the context of supersymmetry a possible explanation was the existence of light supersymmetric particles ( charginos , top - squarks ) , which could suitably enhance @xmath0 . however , the apparently low value for @xmath5 did not seem to have a straightforward interpretation .    since that time the data samples of z bosons analysed , both at the cern lep accelerator and at the slc",
    ", have considerably increased .",
    "the experimental techniques used in b and c - tagging have also improved significantly due to the advent of improved microvertex detectors and the implementation of new tags .",
    "the measurements of the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath2 for b - quarks at the z pole and of the _ polarisation parameter _",
    "@xmath3 , obtained using a polarised electron beam , have improved considerably in accuracy .",
    "the latest , but still largely preliminary , data are examined and values of the vector and axial - vector b - quark and c - quark z couplings are extracted .",
    "the left and right handed couplings are also extracted .",
    "these couplings are compared to those expected in the standard model .",
    "the hypothesis of _ lepton universality _ is built into the sm . in the fits to the current data",
    "set discussed below , the degree to which the data support this hypothesis is discussed .",
    "one important aspect of precision electroweak fits is on the constraints the data give on the standard model higgs boson .",
    "the sensitivity of the limits from electroweak fits to the higgs boson mass to the most sensitive data is examined . in these",
    "fits the precise value of the top - quark mass @xmath8  gev measured at fermilab by the cdf and d0 experiments@xcite is a very important constraint .",
    "the couplings of a fermion f to the z boson are specified by its effective vector and axial - vector couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "a useful quantity is the _ coupling _ or _",
    "polarisation parameter _ for fermion f @xmath11    the pole forward - backward asymmety of fermion f is given by @xmath12    since @xmath13 depends on the ratio @xmath9/@xmath10 , a measurement of @xmath14 depends on both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the effective couplings can also be written as @xmath17 where the mixing angle defined for _ leptons _ ( @xmath18 ) is used for reference .",
    "those defined for quarks have small shifts , due to sm plus any new physics  @xcite .",
    "the z partial decay width to @xmath19 is @xmath20 @xmath21.)m@xmath22 .",
    "this is taken into account in the fits discussed here . ]",
    "the results of measurements of the @xmath23 polarisation are very sensitive to the lepton couplings .",
    "the average @xmath23 polarisation gives a@xmath24 and the forward - backward asymmetry gives a@xmath25 .",
    "the results of the hadronic and leptonic cross - sections and the leptonic forward - backward asymmetries are expressed in terms of the five parameters : the mass and width of the z boson @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the hadronic pole cross - section @xmath28 , the ratio of the hadronic to leptonic widths @xmath29 and the pole forward - backward asymmetry for leptons @xmath30 .",
    "these are chosen to be largely uncorrelated experimentally .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the variables and their definitions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the five parameter formalism assumes _ lepton universality_. if this hypothesis is not imposed then the results are given separately for @xmath31 and @xmath30 for each lepton species ; a total of nine parameters .",
    "the above quantities have been accurately determined by the lep experiments using the large statistics gathered at , or close to , the z peak . at the slc",
    "the polarised electron beam gives additional information on the couplings from a measurement of @xmath32 where @xmath33(@xmath34 ) is the total cross - section for a left ( right ) handed polarised incident electron beam .",
    "this measurement is inclusive to any z final state .",
    "if the forward - backward asymmetry for a fermion f is also measured for the two polarisation states , giving the left - right forward - backward asymmetry @xmath35 , then the coupling @xmath13 can be directly extracted .",
    "measurements of all these quantities have been performed by the sld collaboration .",
    "all of these results can be combined and values of the individual couplings of the leptons and b and c quarks to the z can be extracted .",
    "the sld results give directly @xmath36 , @xmath3 and @xmath37 ; thus giving the ratios of the vector to axial - vector couplings without the use of other data .",
    "the @xmath23 polarisation gives directly values of @xmath36 and a@xmath24 the forward - backward asymmetries obtained using unpolarised beams give the product of @xmath36 and @xmath13 , so the extracted values of @xmath3 and @xmath37 depend on @xmath36 .",
    "the data collection at lep at , and around , the z - boson mass ( lep 1 phase ) finished in 1995 .",
    "although most of the data have been analysed , only preliminary results are generally available , so should be treated with a degree of caution .",
    "the total luminosity recorded by each lep experiment is about 160  pb@xmath38 ; corresponding to about 5 million z decays .",
    "the data used in the fits below are from @xcite .      the results of the nine and five parameter fits to the individual lep experiments are combined , taking into account common systematic errors .",
    "these are given in tables  [ t:9par ] and  [ t:5par ] respectively .",
    "the most important of these are the lep energy errors and the theoretical uncertainty on the luminosity . because of the complicated correlations between the experimental systematic errors between years and between energy points and also those of the lep energy@xcite , the evaluation of the components of the final errors on @xmath26 and @xmath27 arising from the lep energy uncertainty is not straightforward .",
    "however , an estimate of this has been made by the lep electroweak working group @xcite , giving @xmath39 1.7 mev and @xmath40 1.3 mev .",
    ".results and correlation matrix of the 9 parameter fit to the lep data .",
    "the @xmath41/df of the average is 28/27 , a probability of 41% . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the fits to all electroweak data give a central value for @xmath42 of 77  gev , and a one - sided 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit of 246 gev ; see table  [ t : higgs ] .",
    "the lower limit from direct searches of about 90 gev  @xcite is not used in the limits here .",
    "the upper limit does not take into account the theoretical uncertainty due to missing higher order terms .",
    "including an estimate of these ( as discussed in @xcite ) increases this limit increases to 262 gev ; that is , an increase of about 16 gev .",
    "it is of great importance , particularly in the consideration of the construction of new accelerators , to understand if these values are reliable",
    ". one can adopt ( at least ) two approaches to these fits :    * the overall @xmath41 of 14/13 d.f .",
    "= 35% ) for the fit to all data is reasonably good .",
    "the distribution of the pulls has a mean value of -  0.1  @xmath43 0.2 and an rms of 0.9 , and so is compatible with the expected gaussian distribution .",
    "the two measurements with the largest @xmath41 s ( @xmath2 and @xmath44 ) are just the expected `` tails '' of the distribution .",
    "however , these are the two most sensitive measurements to @xmath42 . * the quantities which are most sensitive to @xmath42 are , in order of current sensitivity , @xmath44 , @xmath2,@xmath27 , p@xmath24 , @xmath45 and @xmath30 . these 6 quantities contribute 7.5 to the @xmath41 .",
    "the individual values of the pulls for these 6 quantities are -1.7 , -1.8 , -0.8 , -0.4 , 0.3 and 0.7 respectively .",
    "the central value for @xmath42 is sensitive to which data are included .",
    "for example , if a fit is performed without the inclusion of @xmath44 , the most sensitive quantity to @xmath42 , then , as shown in table  [ t : higgs ] , the one - sided 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit increases to 410 gev , plus the theory error .",
    "however if @xmath2 ( alone ) is excluded from the fit , then the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit on @xmath42 becomes 172 gev .",
    "if both @xmath44 and @xmath2 are excluded , then the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit on @xmath42 becomes 348 gev .",
    "although the 6 most sensitive quantities to @xmath42 have a reasonable total contribution to @xmath41 , the two most sensitive quantities , @xmath44 and @xmath2 have a @xmath41 contribution of 6.0 . if the errors on these two quantities are scaled according to the particle data book recipe , then the 95% c.l",
    "upper limit on @xmath42 becomes 303 gev .    of particular interest",
    "is the extent to which the data indicate that the higgs is light . as can be seen from the fits above , the quantity most responsible for driving the limit higher is @xmath2",
    "however , there is no good reason the reject either the @xmath2 or @xmath44 measurements at the present time .",
    "the value of @xmath3 , which contributes to the b - quark couplings not being very compatible with the sm , has little influence on these fits ; apart from increasing the @xmath41 .",
    "for example , if the value of @xmath3 is set to the sm value instead of the experimentally measured value , then the higgs mass changes by less than 1 gev .    in summary ,",
    "the best estimate is that the higgs is relatively light .",
    "however , the data are not fully compatible , so some caution in intrepreting the data is necessary .",
    "the vector and axial - vector couplings of both the leptons and heavy quarks have been extracted from the most recent electroweak data .",
    "the lepton couplings support the hypothesis of _",
    "lepton universality_.    the c - quark couplings are compatible with sm expectations",
    ". however , those of the b - quark agree with the sm at only the 1% level .",
    "the main discrepancy is for the right - handed coupling of the b - quark .",
    "if real , this would not be easily interpreted in terms of the usual extension to the sm .",
    "however , it should be noted that the data used are mostly still preliminary and that the completed final analyses of all the lep data are eagerly awaited .",
    "possible future running of the slc would clearly be of great benefit in resolving these questions .",
