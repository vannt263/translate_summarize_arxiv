    "recent works on the thermodynamics of black holes have shown that one may enlarge the thermodynamic space to include the effective cosmological constant and other parameters of the gravitational theory as thermodynamic variables .",
    "for instance , in the case of reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) black hole @xcite , considering the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable proportional to the pressure : @xmath1 , its conjugate quantity will be the geometrical volume . in this case",
    "the black hole mass @xmath2 determines the enthalpy : @xmath3 which includes a contribution from the energy of formation of the system @xcite .",
    "also , from the point of view of consistency of smarr formula and first law of thermodynamics , one should extend the thermodynamic space to include the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable @xcite .",
    "the idea of including cosmological constant as the thermodynamic pressure have been studied in many papers ka , do2,do3,ce1,ur .",
    "although in the case of rn black holes the conjugate quantity @xmath4 is the geometrical volume , it is not necessarily needed to be a geometrical volume as it was revealed in the case of rotating black holes @xcite .",
    "in addition to the extension of the thermodynamic space to include the cosmological constant and its conjugate volume , one may extend this space to include other parameters of a black hole provided the mass is equated to the enthalpy .",

    "regards , the critical behavior of charged black holes of einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity in the presence of two liouville - type potentials which make the solution asymptotically neither flat nor ads has been explored in ref .",
    "it was found that the critical exponents are universal and are independent of the details of the system although the thermodynamic quantities depend on the dilaton coupling constant @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further generalize the studies on the extended thermodynamic space and critical behavior of dilaton black holes by investigating the critical behavior of the @xmath0-dimensional dilaton black holes coupled to nonlinear bi electrodynamics @xcite in an extended phase space with fixed charge . due to the fact that the bi lagrangian coupled to a dilaton field appears frequently in string theory ,",
