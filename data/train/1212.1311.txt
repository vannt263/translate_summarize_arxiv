    "the phase diagram in the one - dimensional spinless fermion model has been determinded by many researchers .",
    "it is well known that a transition from luttinger liquid to charge - density - wave phase occurs when the repulsive interaction is twice the hopping interaction .",
    "however , long - range coulomb interactions sometimes also play an important role in frustrated systems due to their geometrical structure .",
    "for example , a spinless fermion , including the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor repulsive interactions can describe the low - energy electronic state of @xmath0 double chains @xcite , and the repulsions plays a significant role in the charge - ordered - insulator - metal transition .",
    "the phases of spinless fermion including the nearest - neighbor as well as next - nearest - neighbor repulsive interactions are more complicated than one might expect .",
    "the model can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the hopping amplitude , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor coulomb interactions .",

    "this mapping can be done by using a jordan - wigner transformation , as both models have the same spectrum .",
    "the phase diagram for hard - core bosons is relevant to the corresponding spinless - fermion model , as is shown in refs .",
    "it is noted that the luttinger - liquid phase in the spinless - fermion model is relevant to the superfluid phase ( sf ) in the hard - core - boson model , and other phases have the same names in the hard - core - boson model and the spinless - fermion model .",
    "we also focus our analysis on the model ( [ eq2 ] ) at half filling .",
