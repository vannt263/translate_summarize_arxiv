    "beyond the shadow of a doubt , quantum theory is one of the most successful theories to date , showing exceptional empirical adequacy in numerous experiments .",
    "the very operational nature of the standard theory , however , has caused much controversy on what the theory actually says about the world beyond empirical predictions .",
    "for instance , such controversy has led to the celebrated paper by einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) @xcite , questioning the completeness of quantum theory as a physical theory .    for almost 30 years , the paradoxical situation raised by epr , and the possibility to complete quantum theory in the form of a local hidden - variable theory received almost no attention among the physics community , presumably considering the question metaphysical .",
    "it thus came as a surprise when bell showed that the empirical adequacy of all local hidden - variable theories , regardless of their details , is actually _",
    "falsifiable _ against the predictions of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "more precisely , bell showed that the correlations of measurement outcomes achievable in any _ bell - local _ theory  with local hidden - variable theories being an example  must satisfy some constraints in the form of inequalities , now commonly referred to as bell inequalities .",
    "moreover , there are probability distributions of measurement outcomes predicted by quantum mechanics that violate such inequalities .",
    "although some loopholes were always present , many independent experiments showed a clear violation of bell inequalities , most notably in the form due to clauser , horner , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) @xcite . therefore , _ there are experimental results that can not be accounted for by any bell - local theory_. despite that , the implications of these empirical observations and of bell s theorem itself are still highly debated ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the importance of the theorem lies in its generality , but this feature makes it also prone to different interpretations .    in this work we put forward the hypothesis that the correlations that appear after many runs of a bell - like experiment are the consequence of a process that takes places at every run of the experiment .",
    "then , using a recent result of colbeck and renner  @xcite , we show that any theory that accounts for such a process and is in accordance with quantum mechanics must violate parameter independence  @xcite .",
    "the connection of this nonlocality with the violation of outcome independence of quantum mechanics will also be discussed .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will begin by recalling bell s theorem in sec .",

    ". this empirical fact will stay regardless of what our best physical theory will be in the future .",
    "a source of many difficulties in appreciating bell s theorem is the fact that , using a certain theory to describe the experiment , an _ apparent _ violation of the bell - locality condition , eq .",
    ", can also happen due to the incompleteness of the theory at hand , a fact discussed at length by bell himself ( see for example chapters 16 and 24 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to understand the implications of bell s theorem ,",
    "let us start by getting a better insight into the meaning of bell - locality . to this end",
    ", we note that a very influential account of the meaning of bell - locality was given by jarrett  @xcite , who proposed to make eq .",
    "more explicit by substituting it with two conditions : _ parameter independence _ @xmath16 and _ outcome independence _ @xmath17 as a consequence of the identity @xmath18 the requirement of bell - locality is equivalent to the conjunction of these conditions  @xcite : @xmath19 a violation of bell - locality is thus a violation of at least one of the two independence conditions mentioned above .    the relation between parameter independence and locality is evident : if turning the knob that controls the setting @xmath0 , one is able to affect what happens in the region @xmath2 , although @xmath7 and @xmath2 are spacelike - separated , then a nonlocal influence is clearly present .",
    "note that a violation of parameter independence alone does not imply that it is practically possible to exchange superluminal signals between the regions @xmath7 and @xmath2 , for which one needs also complete control on @xmath6 , or that the violation of eq .",
    "is still present after averaging over all possible values of @xmath6 compatible with the preparation procedure .",
    "this averaged version of eq .   reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability of @xmath6 for a given preparation procedure .",
    "equation   is referred to as the _ signal locality _ condition in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the _ relativistic causality _ condition in ref .",
    "@xcite , and as the _ no - signaling _ condition in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is a weaker requirement than eq .  .",
    "the meaning of outcome independence is more intricate , as its violation can have different origins .",
    "the first one is the _ incomplete _ specification of the common past of the two subsystems .",
    "consider for example a theory such that the outcomes @xmath1 and @xmath4 are completely determined by the initial state @xmath6 , and therefore any influence between events in @xmath7 and @xmath2 can be excluded beyond any doubt .",
    "suppose for the sake of argument that we may split @xmath6 into two parts @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and consider a new description of the experiment in which @xmath23 is ignored .",
    "the outcome @xmath1 in @xmath7 will then conceivably disclose some information about @xmath4missing in the description of the state @xmath22 and useful to predict the outcome @xmath4that creates a correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "such a violation of outcome independence is due to the incompleteness of the description @xmath22 of the state of the joint system in the theory at hand , and can be overcome by considering an extended theory that recovers the missing information .",
    "however , a more fundamental violation of outcome independence is possible too .",
    "the determination of a particular value @xmath24 for the outcome @xmath1 is an event that happens in the spacetime region @xmath7 , as well as the determination of a value @xmath25 for @xmath4 is an event that happens in the region @xmath2 .",
    "these events could have an impact on each other  through some presently unknown physical mechanism  directly and independently of the past state @xmath6 , or they could both depend on some other event lying outside the common past of @xmath7 and @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , also a violation of outcome independence can be the signature of a nonlocal influence .",
    "bell - locality , parameter independence , and outcome independence are all notions relative to one specific theory : they all involve the description @xmath6 of the state of the system , that is clearly different for different theories . as a consequence , depending on the theory , the same phenomenon may have some account that is bell - local [ i.e. satisfying eq .  ] and some other that is not , some that fulfills parameter independence and some that does not , some that fulfills outcome independence and some that does not , independently of the actual presence of nonlocal influences .",
    "the problem is always the interplay of _ locality _ and _ completeness_. bell s theorem is of such great importance precisely because it is a statement that applies to any possible theory that accounts for the quantum violation , and more generally for the experimentally observed violation of bell inequalities :",
    "_ none _ of them is bell - local .",
    "bell and some of his commentators concluded from this that the incompleteness of a specific theory  something that can be eliminated by considering an extended theory  cannot be the exclusive cause of the correlations found in the outcomes , and a genuine nonlocal influence must be present .",
    "this is however not the unanimous view among physicists , as can be seen in the following passage by dickson ( from page 138 of ref .",

    "@xmath1 and @xmath4 depend exclusively on events that happened inside the common past @xmath8.[item : insidepast ]    in the first case ( for instance when the outcomes are entirely decided inside the regions @xmath7 and @xmath2 ) , the correlations are explained through a nonlocal influence directly intervening in the process that decides the outcomes .    in the second case",
    "there is no direct nonlocal influence between spacelike - separated events ; nevertheless , there is a process not localizable within spacetime that is able to influence the outcomes .",
    "since the measurement events are spacelike - separated , so this process is able to `` transcend '' spacetime and to act nonlocally .",
    "the last case is the only one in which the violation of outcome independence is not manifestly connected to nonlocality .",

    "consider a theory in which the quantum state is supplemented by the specification of these events .",
    "if the problem was solely due to missing information , then this extended theory would satisfy outcome independence , and therefore also bell - locality , but this is ruled out by bell s theorem and by the observed violation of bell inequalities .",
    "hence , the extended theory still needs to violate outcome independence or parameter independence .",
    "recall that the extended theory has been introduced to account for the correlations , therefore it must be able to deliver predictions more refined than those of quantum mechanics .",

    "@xcite implies that it is _ impossible _ to refine the predictions of quantum mechanics by supplementing the quantum state with whatever additional information without violating parameter independence ( maintaing always that no - conspiracy holds ) .",

    "summarizing , the hypothesis of accountability and the result of ref .",
    "@xcite imply that the only cases in which there can be an explanation that does not violate parameter independence are case  [ item : outsidepast ] and  [ item : outsidespacetime ] from the previous list .",
    "therefore , some nonlocal feature is always present .",
    "let us remark that a theory for which case  [ item : outsidepast ] or  [ item : insidepast ] are verified is easy to recognize ; not so for a theory realizing case  [ item : outsidespacetime ] .",
    "an example of the latter would be an extension of quantum theory that consists in taking literally the many worlds interpretation  @xcite . to see this ,",
    "consider a single world among the many ; when a measurement is performed , the considered world has to `` decide '' which outcome to present . the precise way in which this process works is not known , and one can imagine it to take place in the space of the possible outcomes , worlds , or in some other space , but clearly it is _ not _ a process that can be accounted for in the spacetime that we are familiar with . in our setting , when the measurement is performed in the regions @xmath7 and @xmath2 , the pointers of the respective apparatuses have to `` get in touch '' with the mentioned process that decides the outcomes in the considered world .",
    "therefore , the process of decision must be able to somehow influence both the regions @xmath7 and @xmath2 , exerting on them a nonlocal action .",
    "the same is true for consistent histories @xcite , provided the considered world is substituted by the actual history that is realized by a given run of the experiment .",
    "an analogous argument applies also to the interpretation according to which quantum mechanics is local because the two outcomes do not make sense separately , but only as a couple , generated together  ( cf .",
    "passage by dickson quoted at the end of section  [ sec : belllocal+implication ] ) .",
    "indeed , even if the two outcomes are generated together in some outcomes space , outside spacetime , they must still somehow be delivered to the regions @xmath7 and @xmath2 .    of course",
    ", it is conceivable that future physical theories do not satisfy eq .  .",
    "for instance , the analog of eq .   for newtonian and quantum mechanics would be @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are positions and @xmath35 momenta , that is clearly not the case .",
    "on the contrary , it is likely that future theories will reduce to quantum mechanics only in an approximate sense or only in some limit . in this case",
    "we can not make direct use of the result of ref .",
    "nevertheless , it is a fact that quantum mechanics is in very good agreement with the experimental results so far collected in bell - like settings . as a consequence ,",
    "any future theory , however different from quantum mechanics it may seem , must give predictions for bell experiments very close to those of quantum mechanics ; restricting the new theory to this specific kind of set - up , it is then possible to repeat our arguments .",
    "the validity of the hypothesis of accountability is fundamental for our general argument , yet it is not universally accepted among the physics community .",
    "some researcher maintains the view that correlations simply happen , and that no further account beyond the quantum measurement process is possible for the mechanism that gives rise to these correlations at every single run ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this position can not be excluded on a purely logical basis , but it is clearly against the spirit of physics itself , that constantly seeks for a deeper insight into the underlying cause of any observed phenomenon . regarding a phenomenon as non - accountable , in the authors opinion , represents a dangerous move in any scientific endeavor .",
    "if an observed phenomenon does not have an explanation in terms of accepted facts and principles of nature , it should be taken as a sign that some of these premises have to be revised .",
    "for sure , the progress of science would be extremely limited if renouncing the explicability of unexpected phenomenon were accepted as part of the scientific methods .    to summarize , under the assumptions that ( 1 ) measurement settings can be chosen freely independent of each other and of the prior state of the physical system to be tested , and ( 2 ) it is possible to explain the correlations of the data collected in many runs of a bell experiment in terms of what happens in each single run , we provided an explicit proof that every theory that accounts for the quantum violation of bell inequalities must violate parameter independence , thereby being clearly nonlocal .",
    "an analysis of the violation of outcome independence of quantum mechanics shows that it also is a manifestation of nonlocality .",
    "indeed , the only case in which this violation is not a direct consequence of a nonlocal process , is that in which it is caused by lack of information about the common past @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , a theory taking into account this information must necessarily violate parameter independence .    to conclude we wish to stress once more that , assuming that the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics are correct , the hypothesis of accountability implies that it is not complete .",
    "therefore , maintaining the completeness of quantum mechanics is equivalent to maintaining that a phenomenon exists , for which no account is possible .",
