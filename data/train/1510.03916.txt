    "beyond the main - sequence of a stellar population , a star with an initial mass less than 8  evolves to the red giant phase at which it ejects most of its mass through a slow and dense wind ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the intense mass loss process reaches its climax at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) with a rate of @xmath9 forming an extensive circumstellar envelope ( cse , @xmath10@xmath11 ) .",
    "such an evolutionary phase leads to the obscuration of the innermost envelope region near the stellar surface .",
    "consequently , information on the onset of dust formation and growth , the subsequent wind acceleration , the central engine governing the ( a)symmetric shapes of the entire cse , and the connection of these features with binary interactions and/or magnetic fields is very limited .",
    "the morphological diversity of the cses in evolved stellar phases is commonly assumed to be closely related to the possible binary nature of the system .",
    "in contrast to quasi - spherical shapes of cses at the agb , the majority of planetary nebulae ( pne ) or protoplanetary nebulae ( ppne ) bear bipolar or multipolar structures , often observed in ionized gas or dust scattered light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such bipolarity is a common feature of sources possessing accretion disks such as the protoplanetary jets coexisting with the accretion disks surrounding young stellar objects . in the outflowing cse of evolved giant stars , another gravitational potential ( e.g. , companion )",
    "is hypothesized to assemble material in the form of circumstellar or circumbinary disk to feed the observed bipolar outflow .",
    "the accretion disks may form during the agb phase in _ close _ binary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ wide _ binary systems also induce , albeit less vigorous , asymmetry in the form of spiral patterns .",
    "it is now theoretically well understood that binary orbital motion leads to a spiral - shell pattern propagating over the entire cse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the consequent wind anisotropy , caused by the binary orbital motion and the gravitational focusing of the wind material onto the companion , leads an overall flattened geometry of the cse @xcite .",
    "the binary - induced pattern and geometry of cse preserve the records of binary influence on the wind outflow . a well - defined spiral pattern of afgl 3068 found from dust scattered light and the binary separation inferred from near - infrared adaptive optics images @xcite were utilized to derive its binary stellar and orbital properties @xcite .",
    "the non - continuous shells within the cse of cit 6 , which appeared in a molecular line emission @xcite , were suggested to be a spiral - shell pattern when viewed with a large inclination from the orbital plane @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation may also be applicable to the multiple rings and arcs often found in the cses of agb stars and ppne , e.g. , irc+10216 @xcite and mira @xcite .",
    "in addition , within this framework , the wind properties derived from the circumstellar spiral pattern facilitated constraints on the mass loss history of r sculptoris @xcite .",
    "finally , the elliptical shapes of cses of agb stars in an optical imaging survey were suggested as a probe to infer that a significant fraction of agb stars may have hidden binary companions @xcite .",
    "in fact , substantial ppne may reveal evidence of the shape transition from outer rings and arcs formed in the cse during the previous agb phase to the inner region showing bipolar lobes developed by new vigorous ejections ( e.g. , egg nebula , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the ring - like patterns originated from binary orbital motion , the typical dynamical timescales of the observed patterns ( 1001000 years ) correspond to the orbital periods of wide binary systems with the companions locating at a few tens to hundred au .",
    "such separations between binary stars are far larger than radius of wind acceleration zone so that the wind speed is sufficiently fast in the vicinity of the companion ( if it is in a circular orbit ) , precluding formation of an accretion disk and consequently a bipolar outflow . whether a _ wide",
    "_ binary can create a bipolar outflow has not been well studied . the onset of the asymmetric outflow , the role of a binary companion on it , and ultimately the mass loss process may be addressed by sub - arcsecond resolution observations toward the sources in this phase transition from the agb to ppn .",
    "the extreme carbon star cit 6 is an excellent target to study the role of a companion on the transition from a quasi - spherical shell - like structure ( over @xmath12 ) found in a molecular line emission map @xcite to a nascent bipolar structure ( @xmath13 ) observed in the near - infrared polarization image @xcite .",
    "the companion candidate revealed in optical images is @xmath14 away from the carbon star at a position angle ( pa , from north to east ) of @xmath15 @xcite . at a distance of 400pc (",
    "* and references therein ) derived by using a period - luminosity relation from the pulsation period of the carbon star ( @xmath16yr ) , the projected binary separation corresponds to @xmath17au . the observed flux at 4500  suggests the candidate companion to be a main - sequence star of mass @xmath182  @xcite . on the other hand , the effective temperature @xmath19k @xcite and bolometric luminosity @xmath20 @xcite locate the carbon star cit 6 at the tip of agb of a star with an initial mass of @xmath21   ( current mass @xmath22 ) based on the stellar evolutionary model with solar metallicity using the code provided by @xcite .",
    "these photometric masses agree with the masses derived from a separate , parameter space analysis based on binary dynamics and the encoded circumstellar pattern @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar pattern of cit 6 was observed in the hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 line emission at a high resolution of @xmath23 with the karl g.  jansky very large array ( jvla ) .",
    "the pattern was modeled with spherical shells , resulting in a necessary displacement of shell centroids along the radius and across the line velocity channels ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for various hc@xmath0n and hc@xmath24n lines of cit 6 ) .",
    "this departure from spherical symmetry is consistent with the spiral - shell model induced by a binary motion , and @xcite indeed presented a spiral - shell model reproducing the observed hc@xmath0n pattern in all channels .",
    "previously , @xcite speculated a spiral structure of cit 6 from another hc@xmath0n @xmath2=54 emission map at a lower resolution of @xmath25 , which is now resolved into a few windings of the modeled spiral - shell pattern .",
    "nevertheless , the pattern geometry was left incomplete , because the observed hc@xmath0n pattern is broken with an absence of emission to the west and in the central @xmath26 region .",
    "verifying the pattern shape with a chemically stable molecule such as @xmath1co is necessary to infer the companion of cit 6 , to examine the binary characteristics , and to obtain a clue of the kinematic connection of the spiral pattern to the observed near - infrared bipolar nebula in the innermost region where the hc@xmath0n emission was absent .    in this paper",
    ", we report the submillimeter array ( sma ) observations toward cit 6 in the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 lines and the 226.2ghz and 350.6ghz continuum emission at sub - arcsecond resolutions .",
    "submillimeter telescope ( smt ) grid - mapping observations for the same lines are combined with the sma data to recover the extended cse emission .",
    "we describe the observations and calibrations in section[sec : obs ] .",

    "the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 lines and the adjacent continuum ( at 226.2 ghz ) have been simultaneously observed with the sma in four different configurations ( see table[tab : sma ] ) .",
    "these configurations provided the projected baselines ranging from @xmath27 m to @xmath28 m .",
    "the observations were carried out on five different dates . on 2013 jan .",
    "08 and feb .",
    "06 for extended and very extended configurations , two receivers were simultaneously setup with one receiver at @xmath29ghz covering @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 , and the other receiver at @xmath30ghz .",
    "each receiver has 2ghz if - bandwidth . on 2013 dec .   12 , 2014 feb .",
    "09 , and 2014 mar .",
    "11 , however , one 230ghz receiver was setup with 4ghz if - bandwidth .",
    "several lines were detected , but were spatially unresolved ; hence , in this paper , we focus on the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 lines .",
    "the primary beam sizes of the sma antenna are @xmath31 at 230ghz and @xmath32 at 350ghz , respectively .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated with the standard procedure using the mir package with two quasars 0854 + 201 and 0927 + 390 as the gain ( phase and amplitude ) calibrators , and a quasar , either 3c84 or 3c279 , as the bandpass calibrator .",
    "the flux calibrations were mainly based on the sma flux monitoring program of a large number of quasars , tabulated in the tools section of the sma observer center @xcite ; when titan or callisto is available , the fluxes of the observed quasars measured based on the planetary object were consistent with the monitoring records .",
    "the miriad packages were used for the inverse fourier transformation and image cleaning from the calibrated visibility data to the final channel maps .",
    "the synthesized beam size of the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 line emission map is @xmath33 with a pa of @xmath34 with the uniform weighting of the visibility data from all configurations listed in table[tab : sma ] .",
    "the velocity interval was set to be 1  in the imaging step .",
    "the noise level @xmath35 estimated from the line - free channels is 24  ( 2.2k ) at the velocity resolution of 1 .",
    "the continuum map at 226.2ghz was attained by averaging over the line - free channels of both sidebands ( separated by 10ghz ) with uniform weighting of the data from all sma configurations .",
    "its synthesized beam has a size of @xmath36 with a pa of 40 , and the noise level is 0.75  ( 76mk ) .",
    "the 350.6ghz continuum imaging is characterized by a synthesized beam of @xmath37 with a pa of 25  and a noise of 3.6  ( 330mk ) .",
    "the smt grid - mapping observations have been carried out to fill in the zero and short baselines of the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 lines using the 1.3 mm sideband - separating receivers with dual - polarization .",
    "the integration per pointing of the grid - mapping is 3min for @xmath1co and 6min for @xmath3co ( see table[tab : smt ] ) .",
    "deep single - point observations toward the central position were additionally performed ; the total integration for @xmath1co central pointing is 11min , and 392min for @xmath3co .",
    "a 1024-channel ( 2@xmath38512 ) backend with a 1mhz filterbank was employed .",
    "the on / off - integrations were repeated to correct the sky background variation via position - switching for the grid - mapping mode and beam - switching for the single - point mode .",
    "pointing corrections were monitored by observations of jupiter .",
    "the beam size of a single pointing is @xmath39 at 1.3 mm .",
    "using the class software package in gildas , we subtracted the linear baseline fits , and co - added the individual scans to achieve the final spectra .",
    "the temperature scales , @xmath40 , of @xmath1co and @xmath3co lines are 2.95k and 0.20k , respectively , at the peaks , comparable ( with @xmath4120% uncertainty ) to the values in earlier smt single - pointing observations ( 2.49k for @xmath1co and 0.22k for @xmath3co , by * ? ? ?",
    "the main - beam temperatures were derived by @xmath42 with the main - beam efficiency @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 noise levels of the grid - mapping data ( in @xmath46 ) are 17mk and 15mk for the @xmath1co and @xmath3co maps , respectively .",
    "the noise levels of central pointings with the long integrations are 11mk for the @xmath1co and 3mk for the @xmath3co .",
    "we used miriad to combine the sma interferometric and smt single - dish data following the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "visibilities from the smt single - dish images are generated by ( 1 ) deconvolving the smt maps with their gaussian beams ( fwhms of @xmath39 and @xmath47 for @xmath1co and @xmath3co frequencies , respectively ) , ( 2 ) attenuating these deconvolved smt images with the sma primary beams ( fwhms of @xmath31 and @xmath48 , respectively ) , and ( 3 ) generating visibilities from the above ( sma primary beam attenuated ) maps .",
    "we set the integration time per visibility equivalent to be the one per sma visibility .",
    "the number of smt visibilities was @xmath49 ; varying this number within a factor of a few does not change the final image as far as the uniform weighting is employed .",
    "these smt visibilities are combined with the sma visibilities from all configurations and fourier - transformed to dirty images by the miriad s invert task .",
    "figure[fig : uvl ] shows the flux consistency of the visibility data from the smt and the different configurations of sma .    after the deconvolution process with the miriad s clean task , we restored the clean components with the gaussian beams that have the same solid angles as their corresponding dirty beams .",
    "@xcite emphasized the importance of this process for conserving the total flux , in particular , when sources with extended low level emission are involved .",
    "conventionally in a restored image , the clean components are convolved with a synthesized beam ( defined as a gaussian function fitting the main lobe of the dirty beam ) , and the residuals ( in units of the dirty beam solid angle ) are added back .",
    "departure of the dirty beam from the gaussian shape leads to inconsistency in the beam solid angle between the dirty beam and the derived synthesized beam , resulting in an artificial mismatch of the total flux .",
    "the conventional method works well in the cases of compact sources , where the cleaning process results in negligible residuals . in our case , because of the extended nature of the cse and the non - gaussian shape of the dirty beam , we defined new gaussian beams having the same solid angles as the dirty beams , ensuring the total fluxes to be conserved after cleaning and restoring the images .",
    "the pas and beam axis ratios are set to the ones for the main lobes of dirty beams .",
    "finally , the combined images are corrected for the sma primary beam attenuation .",
    "more detailed description for combining the single - dish and interferometer data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final images of @xmath1co and @xmath3co have the beam sizes of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , with the pa of 37 .",
    "the noise levels are 25  ( 150mk ) for the @xmath1co map and 22  ( 140mk ) for the @xmath3co map .",
    "the position and flux of the continuum are determined by the uvfit task of miriad . in both 226.2ghz and 350.6ghz continuum ,",
    "the visibility amplitudes are fairly flat in the @xmath52 distance ( i.e. , projected baseline length in wavelengths ) range of 40400k@xmath53 ( see figure[fig : uvc ] ) , implying a spatially unresolved source . in this @xmath52 distance range , we have tried to find the best point , gaussian , or disk source model , resulting in the flux and positional offset almost independent on the models . moreover , the resulting gaussian and disk sizes are comparable to the sizes in our trial fit for a phase calibrator , essentially a point source ; therefore we adopt the point source model for the visibility data at 40400k@xmath53 .",
    "the 226.2ghz continuum visibility amplitudes from the subcompact and compact configurations of sma ( 450k@xmath53 ) are higher and increase toward the shorter baselines .",
    "the visibility data from all sma configurations are best fit with a two - component model in a combination of one point source and one extended component as denoted by a solid curve in figure[fig : uvc ] ( see table[tab : con ] ) .",
    "the residual image of the two - component model indeed shows a random noise distribution ( figure[fig : con](b ) ) , in contrast to the one - component model where unexpected structures remain in the residuals ( figure[fig : con](c)(d ) ) .",
    "given the uncertainty of visibility data , it is currently difficult to differentiate the gaussian and disk models for the extended component .",
    "figure[fig : sed ] presents the comparison of the sma continuum flux at 226.2ghz and 350.6ghz with various measurements known in the literature at different frequencies .",
    "the 226.2ghz and 350.6ghz flux of the unresolved continuum component ( together with a 36.5ghz continuum flux from another subarcsec - resolution observation with the jvla ) is described by a spectral index @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is defined by @xmath56 .",
    "this spectral index is expected for thermal blackbody radiation in the rayleigh - jeans limit . the compact nature and the spectral index close to @xmath57 in the millimeter and centimeter wavelengths",
    "may indicate that the unresolved component of the sma continuum emerges from a `` radio photosphere '' surrounding the stellar ( optical ) photosphere , which is introduced by @xcite for long - period variables .",
    "@xcite showed that the radio photosphere is about twice the size of the optical photosphere .    with an effective temperature ( @xmath19k ) of cit 6 from the observed na i d line at 5893  @xcite and its bolometric luminosity @xmath58 from the integrated infrared emission @xcite",
    ", the stefan - boltzmann law @xmath59 implies the stellar ( optical ) photosphere radius @xmath60au . adopting the radio photosphere to be twice the size of the stellar photosphere @xcite",
    ", we applied a diameter of 8au ( 20 mas ) and the corresponding radio photosphere brightness temperature of 2000k for a black body curve drawn by a solid line in figure[fig : sed ] .",
    "this line is consistent with the sma measurements for the unresolved continuum source .",
    "the radio photosphere size of cit 6 is comparable to that of irc+10216 ( 11au ) observed as a resolved disk at 43.3ghz continuum @xcite .",
    "the data from infrared to centimeter wavelengths are fitted to a spectral index of @xmath61 , confirming the result of @xcite via a fit over a wide wavelength range ( 0.51 mm ) .",
    "it presents the excess thermal emission from circumstellar dusts .",
    "the upper point at 226.2ghz ( 1.3 mm ) in figure[fig : sed ] is the total flux of the two - component ( point source and gaussian ) model given in table[tab : con ] . if the dashed line fit provides a rough estimate for the total flux at 226.2ghz , albeit not obvious with the large deviation of the accumulated data , the extended continuum component of our sma observations ( 34.5mjy , fwhm@xmath62 ) recovers about 50% of the total thermal dust emission .",
    "there might exist more extended dust emission , missed in the sma interferometric observations .",
    "the coordinate center in this paper corresponds to right ascension ( ra ) at 10@xmath6316@xmath6402259 and declination ( dec ) at @xmath6530341918 in j2000 coordinates , derived from the visibility fitting of the unresolved continuum emission of cit 6 at 226.2ghz .",
    "figure[fig : cen ] shows the comparison of this position at the epoch 2013.1 with the optical , hcn maser , and 90.7ghz continuum positions of cit 6 at the epochs 1955.3 , 1988.1 , and 1995.2 @xcite . from the center positions in the four measurements , we calculate the linear proper motion of ( @xmath66 , @xmath67)masyr@xmath68 , which is in accord with those from the direct measures of positional shifts with respect to reference stars in optical and infrared images ; ( @xmath69 , @xmath70)masyr@xmath68 @xcite , and ( @xmath71 , @xmath72)masyr@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "therefore , cit 6 is moving to the northwest direction with a projected speed of @xmath73 , which is also consistent with the speed derived from an astrospheric feature at @xmath74@xmath75 in far - ultraviolet images @xcite .",
    "figure[fig : spe ] illustrates the spectral profiles of @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 lines varying with integration radius .",
    "the @xmath1co spectra have a red - skewed doubly - peaked profile when integrated over the central region ( @xmath76 ) as shown in panel ( a ) , a flat - topped profile over @xmath77 region in ( b ) , and approximately parabolic profiles over larger @xmath39 and @xmath78 regions in ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "these parabolic and flat - topped shapes of @xmath1co line profiles are typical for an optically thick source when it is spatially unresolved and resolved , respectively @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath3co spectral profiles have double peak features regardless of the integration areas , although the spectrum in ( d ) integrated over the entire smt mapping area may be also interpreted as a flat - topped profile with the given noise . according to @xcite ,",
    "an optically thin source produces a double peak shape in the spectral profile when it is spatially resolved , and a flat - topped profile when unresolved ; hence , the @xmath3co line emitting region is likely similar to , or smaller than , the smt mapping area ( i.e. , the integrated area for ( d ) panel ) . the @xmath3co envelope is generally smaller than the @xmath1co envelope because of the self - shielding capability of the abundant @xmath1co molecules against photodissociation by interstellar ultraviolet radiation field . therefore , considering the nearly flat - topped shape of @xmath3co line together with the parabolic shape of @xmath1co line , our smt mapping area ( @xmath79 ) likely covers most of , if not all of , the entire cse of cit 6 in the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 line emission .",
    "we define the systemic velocity ( @xmath80 ) as the middle of two peaks of the @xmath3co @xmath2=21 spectrum from the central @xmath81 region , presented in ( a ) panel . the velocity @xmath82 hereafter represents the velocity with respect to the systemic velocity ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the @xmath3co spectrum in the central @xmath81 region is sharply doubly peaked at @xmath84 , beyond which the intensity levels quickly drop to zero within 2 .",
    "the outer parts of @xmath3co emission seem to have an extra velocity component around @xmath85 , as seen in ( b ) panel , in a comparable brightness temperature level with that of the @xmath86 component . in ( c ) and",
    "( d ) panels , this component predominates over the @xmath86 component that appears as a broader shelf in the blueshifted velocity range .",
    "in contrast , the red peak velocity does not change much with the integration radius .",
    "the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 spectral asymmetry depends on the integration area . in figure[fig : spe](a ) , the central region ( @xmath76 ) has a red - skewed doubly peaked spectrum with the redshifted peak ( at @xmath87 ) about 30% brighter than the blueshifted peak ( at @xmath88 ) . in order to quantify the spectral profile asymmetries varying with the integration area , we define the fraction of asymmetry as the emission excess of the positive velocity component ( at 0 to 16 ) beyond the negative velocity component ( at @xmath89 to 0 ) . in the central 1  region shown in ( a ) , the positive velocity emission is about 40% brighter than the negative velocity emission , i.e. , the fraction of asymmetry is 40% . as the integration area increases ,",
    "the fraction of asymmetry is reduced to 30% in the ( nearly ) flat - topped profile in @xmath90 region shown in ( b ) , and to 10% and 5% in ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "this decrease of the fraction of asymmetry with the integration radius implies that the source of spectral asymmetry is placed in the central region of the @xmath1co line emission . for comparison ,",
    "the fractions of asymmetry of the @xmath3co @xmath2=21 line spectra are within @xmath91 regardless of integration area .",
    "considering the cse of an agb star having radial flows with a nearly constant velocity , the channel at the expansion velocity exhibits emission integrated along the line of sight .",
    "hence , it is subject to an optically thick condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical depth at the systemic velocity channel , exhibiting the emission from the plane of the sky , is relatively small .",
    "therefore , in figure[fig : pro ] , we use the systemic velocity channel to compare the radial profiles of the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 brightness temperatures averaged over azimuthal angles .    in order to examine the brightness distribution from small to large scales ,",
    "we generate maps for four different combinations of sma and smt data : sma - only ( yellow ; beam size @xmath92 ) , joint of sma and smt ( black ; @xmath93 ) , joint of sma subcompact and compact configuration with smt ( blue ; @xmath94 ) , and smt - only ( red ; @xmath39 ) .",

    "the only significant deviation from the rest configuration data occurs in the sma - only profile , dramatically dropping beyond its maximum recoverable scale ( @xmath101 ) due to the finite minimum projected baseline ( @xmath27 m ) . despite such missing flux in the sma interferometry beyond the maximum recoverable scale , the minimum baseline of the sma - only data was sufficiently short so that the resulting brightness temperature reduction ( @xmath102k ) does not significantly change the profile within @xmath103 . indeed , the convolution of the sma - only map with a @xmath104-sized gaussian beam yields the peak and integrated brightness temperatures of 3.74k ( at @xmath105 ) and 98.0k , essentially identical with the values from a 23-beam single - dish observation .",

    "the overall profile to the west is 25% steeper than in all the other directions .",
    "this deficiency of the @xmath1co line emission to the west probably indicates a lower mass ejection along this direction due to , e.g. , anisotropic dust formation near the stellar surface , or non - constant orbital speed of the star .    the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams in figure[fig : pvd](a)(b ) better exhibit the pattern in a continuous and definitive shape .",

    "this change of arm interval can be due to a temporal decrease of the wind velocity .      upon a close inspection of the zoomed - in channel maps for the @xmath1co emission ( figure[fig : cpk ] ) ,",
    "the shape of emitting region is not circular and varies with channels .",
    "we further investigate the positional change of channel peaks by fitting the observed offsets along the axes of ra and dec with sinusoidal functions in the form of @xmath118 , as shown in figure[fig : fit](a)(b ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath119 represents the average emission peak position , @xmath120 the scale of maximum positional shift , and @xmath121 the channel velocity scale for which the positional variation of emission peaks occurs .",
    "here , we focus on the velocity range between @xmath122 and @xmath123 . the rapid change of peak positions at the high - end velocities ( related to a bipolar outflow ) is discussed in section[sec : jet ] .",
    "these separately fitted sinusoidal functions for ra and dec both have the same @xmath121 parameter of 17.7 , indicating that the emission peak position varies periodically in the scale of the expansion velocity of the envelope . because of the consistency of cycles in ra and dec , the combined fitting results lead to a closed ellipse as a function of channel velocity as shown in figure[fig : fit](c ) .",
    "it approximates an ellipse with an ellipticity @xmath124 and a major axis on the scale @xmath125 with the pa @xmath126 .",
    "the peak positions of channels at @xmath127 and @xmath128 become closer to the continuum peak position , which we defined as the coordinate center . in average , the channel peaks of the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 emission are located at the northwest side of the continuum peak position ( @xmath129 ; @xmath130 ) .",

    "the positional measurement uncertainty is given by the largest value amongst ( 1 ) the beam size divided by the peak signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath131 in most channels ; it increases to @xmath132 at the line edge channel ) , ( 2 ) the positional ( or phase ) uncertainty of the gain calibrators derived by the same method experiments ( @xmath133 ) , and ( 3 ) the image pixel size ( 003 ) .",
    "however , these provide a lower limit of the positional uncertainty as the @xmath1co emission is extended . a firm conclusion on the spatial change of the emission peak ( in a rotating sense ) with velocity and its relationship with the binary motion in an inclined orbital plane",
    "are the subject of higher spatial and spectroscopic resolution observations .      the @xmath1co spectrum in figure[fig : spe](a ) for the central 1   region exhibits a small bump at @xmath134 , distinguished from the main line by a valley at @xmath135 . such a feature is also found in p - v diagrams , appearing as an island located at @xmath136 ( see figure[fig : pvd](a)(b ) ) .",
    "this component contributes about 1.4% in the total flux .",

    "these spectral features were interpreted as an indication of heating due to shock interaction between the inner fast collimated winds and the outer slow nearly spherical winds ejected during the agb phase .",
    "the emission from the hot shocked region is vulnerable to self - absorption by the surrounding cooler medium . the blue bump feature , in addition to the depressed blue peak below the red peak in figure[fig : spe ] ,",
    "can be also induced in a perfectly spherical wind due to partial self - absorption of the central warmer emission by the outer cooler envelope @xcite .",
    "self - absorption was introduced by both @xcite and @xcite in explaining the blue bump features , but the geometry and physical mechanism of the hot inner source are different from each other .    as clearly seen in figure[fig : jet ] , the observed blue bump of cit 6 originates from a bipolar outflow .",
    "figure[fig : jet ] is the same as the highest velocity channels in figure[fig : chm ] , but in blue and red contours for the blueshifted ( @xmath138 ) and redshifted ( 19 ) components , respectively . for comparison , the emission peak at the systemic velocity",
    "is also plotted in green contours , showing its position significantly close to the continuum peak position ( gray - scaled image ) .",
    "in contrast , the high - velocity emission peaks are definitely offset from the continuum peak position to the northeast - southwest direction . with the directional similarity",

    "the @xmath138 component has an elongated shape to the northeast .",
    "it is distributed in a conical shape about the pa of 55 , which is consistent with the pa of the near - infrared reflection nebula ( 080 ) shown in @xcite .",
    "the size ( @xmath26 at @xmath114 ) of this component is comparable to the size of the near - infrared bipolar nebula .",
    "its conical shape has the vertex close to , but slightly south of , the continuum peak position . assuming that the continuum peak position coincides with the location of the visible red point source ( the probable carbon star ) in @xcite , the location of the visible blue point source ( possibly the companion , @xmath14 south of the red source ) is marked by a cross symbol in figure[fig : jet ] . with the current angular resolution , it is difficult to distinguish whether the conical outflow originates from the carbon star or the companion .",
    "the redshifted component is considerably smaller ( @xmath139 at @xmath140 ) than the blueshifted component .",
    "the redshifted component at @xmath141 extends to the south or southeast in figure[fig : jet ] . the central spectrum in figure[fig : spe](a )",
    "does not show any special feature at @xmath141 , unlike the blueshifted component appears as a small bump .",
    "however , figure[fig : cpk ] and [ fig : fit ] show that the position of emission peak in each channel beyond 16  gradually shifts to the southeast as the velocity increases .",
    "this shift is noticeable because the emission peak of each channel remains within the central 02 regime in most of velocity range ( @xmath122 to 16 ) .",
    "the 19  component appears to consist of two features , one in a pa of 190  and the other in 150 .",
    "this is most evident for the red contour corresponding to @xmath142 .",
    "the component along the pa of 190  is approximately in the direction opposite to the blue component .",
    "the presence of red component along the pa of 150  implies multipolar nature , together with a discrete blue component at @xmath140 level in the opposite ( northwest ) direction .",
    "we note a cometary - shaped silicate feature at 9.7@xmath143 m @xcite along the pa of @xmath144 with a large extension up to 7   ( at 1% of the peak intensity ) , which is exactly on the opposite side of our @xmath138 component .",
    "currently , however , there is no strong evidence to further relate the 9.7@xmath143 m feature to the redshifted component of the bipolar outflow .",
    "we have performed simple , one - dimensional , non - local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations using the sparx code to understand the overall distribution of the @xmath1co and @xmath3co molecules in the cse of cit 6 . since our focus here is on the overall cse distribution , the observed fine structures ( as described in section[sec : fin ] ) are ignored in the modeling ; see @xcite for a spiral - shell model for cit 6 , characterizing the hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 pattern in channel maps . in figures[fig : spe ] and [ fig : pro ] , we present a simple model for an agb envelope expanding with a constant expansion velocity @xmath145 , a mass loss rate @xmath146 , a temperature distribution @xmath147 , a stochastic velocity of 1 , constant fractional abundances of molecules ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) , and a distance of 400pc .",

    "the optical depth of the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 model at the systemic velocity is low ( @xmath150 ) at the center , increases to @xmath21 at @xmath101 , and decreases back to @xmath150 at @xmath151 . on the other hand",
    ", the expansion velocity channel has the large optical depth greater than 4 for almost all emitting regions with the peak value over 10 at @xmath152 . the over - predicted flux in figure[fig : spe](d )",
    "may indicate that the @xmath1co abundance in the outermost region is lower than in the inner region possibly because of photodissociation due to interstellar ultraviolet photons .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the radius at which the abundance drops to half of its photospheric value derived to be @xmath106 by e.g. , @xcite , based on @xcite .    the radial profile of @xmath3co @xmath2=21 ,",
    "however , is not achieved by merely changing the _ single _ molecular fractional abundance with the same fixed mass loss rate and temperature profile as in @xmath1co model . the @xmath3co modeled and observed",
    "spectra are not too far off in the inner part ( figure[fig : spe](a)(b ) ) ; but the outer envelope of cit 6 contains significantly more @xmath3co emission compared to the model ( figure[fig : spe](c)(d ) ) .",
    "in fact , as seen in figure[fig : pro ] , the @xmath3co radial profile of cit 6 is relatively flatter and more attributed by extended component than in @xmath1co .",
    "the significant difference in slopes of the @xmath1co and @xmath3co radial profiles may imply a variation of their abundance ratio with radius .",
    "the @xmath1co/@xmath3co abundance ratio 50 in the presented model is somewhat larger than the value @xmath153 in the literature . our choice for the @xmath3co fractional abundance results from matching the brightness temperatures in the inner region closely the observed values , at the expense of the outer region .",
    "we have checked that the modeled @xmath3co spectra with a ratio @xmath4 can reproduce the smt single - dish observational data ( i.e. , for figure[fig : spe](c)(d ) ) , consistent with the earlier models by e.g. , @xcite , but resulting in a mismatch in the inner envelope .",
    "it may indicate that @xmath1co/@xmath3co abundance ratio varies with radius .",
    "considering both the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 high resolution maps together , four to five windings of the spiral - shell pattern are found . in terms of their location , there are close agreements between the @xmath1co and hc@xmath0n patterns manifested in the channel maps ( figure[fig : chm ] ) and the p - v diagrams ( figure[fig : pvd ] ) .",
    "for example , to the west where the hc@xmath0n pattern is broken , the @xmath1co pattern is present and smoothly connects the hc@xmath0n segments from the north to the south .",
    "figure[fig : pvd](a ) and ( c ) show the @xmath1co and hc@xmath0n patterns along the pa of 10 , and their overlay in figure[fig : pvd](e ) demonstrates their coincidence .",

    "however , their overlay in ( f ) again shows a good correlation .    albeit there is a good correlation in the pattern locations",
    ", some differences can be found between the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 maps .",
    "the @xmath1co emission is omnipresent in the cse of cit 6 , while the hc@xmath0n line emission is absent toward the center and west sides ( see figure[fig : chm ] , e.g. , the panels for @xmath105 and 5 ) .",
    "the @xmath1co map exclusively reveals the first and second windings in the central 5  region , while their hc@xmath0n counterparts are missed .",
    "the p - v diagrams ( figure[fig : pvd](a)(b ) ) further exhibit the richness of the @xmath1co structure within the central 5 , where hc@xmath0n is lacking as shown in figure[fig : pvd](c)(d ) .",

    "the @xmath1co structures appearing at @xmath109 and @xmath103 in figure[fig : pvd](b ) are completely missed in the corresponding p - v diagram of hc@xmath0n , i.e. , figure[fig : pvd](d ) .",
    "to the west side where the hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 emission was absent , the @xmath1co @xmath2=21 arm pattern appears but its radial profile is steeper than in any other directions .",
    "it implies that the west side is indeed special in both molecules , probably indicating anisotropic mass loss .",
    "nevertheless , the complete non - detection of the western part of spiral arm pattern in hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 implies that the chemical effects on hc@xmath0n may be not negligible .",
    "the @xmath1co emission is seen in both the compressed spiral arm and the interarm region , whereas the hc@xmath0n emission seems to be mostly enhanced in the outer edge of the shock front as following . in the outer region where the hc@xmath0n pattern is prominent ( @xmath26 to 10 ) , the spiral - shell pattern appears better in hc@xmath0n with high arm - interarm contrasts .",
    "the hc@xmath0n pattern segments are narrow ( comparable to its synthesized beam size @xmath23 ) , while the @xmath1co arm pattern is broader and the arm - interarm contrasts are smaller . in addition , the hc@xmath0n emission peaks marked by red circles in figure[fig : pvd](e)(f ) tend to be located slightly outside of the @xmath1co emission peaks ( blue ) .",
    "all these features may indicate that hc@xmath0n is sufficiently excited at the edge of the spiral arm region tracing the shock front .    the critical density for a molecular line transition , at which the emission induced by molecular collisions dominates over spontaneous emission , gives an approximate lower limit on the gas density in the emitting region of such line transition .",
    "the critical density of @xmath1co @xmath2=21 is nearly independent of temperature ( @xmath154 ) , while that of hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 is higher ( @xmath155 for @xmath156k ) and drops with temperature .",
    "it implies that the hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 is a higher density tracer at the typical average temperatures of agb cses ( @xmath156k ) . in the radius range ( @xmath15710 ) where the hc@xmath0n pattern of cit 6 is observed ,",
    "a low interarm number density @xmath158@xmath159 and gas temperature @xmath160k are expected @xcite .",
    "therefore the lack of hc@xmath0n line emission in the interarm region is reasonable . within the spiral arm ,",
    "a number density of @xmath161@xmath162@xmath159 with a temperature of several hundreds kelvins is possible @xcite .",
    "hence , molecular collisions are sufficient for exciting hc@xmath0n @xmath2=43 , explaining the high arm - interarm contrast in the hc@xmath0n map . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical density of @xmath1co @xmath2=21 is independent of gas temperature , making this emission well excited in both arm and interarm regions , and reducing the contrast between the arm and interarm regions .",
    "the systemic velocity channel interestingly shows a double spiral feature in the central @xmath163 region , as shown in figure[fig : dsp ] ( see also the middle panel of figure[fig : chm ] for a larger field ) , which was not generated in the previous hydrodynamic simulation assuming a constant wind velocity of 17  @xcite .",
    "a slower wind at the locus of the companion may facilitate generation of another spiral ( see e.g. , figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provided that the flow velocity is less than the escape velocity from the companion s gravitational potential .",
    "the inner double spirals are expected to merge together within one to two windings because of their different pattern propagation speeds . this merging seems to occur at around 4  in cit 6 , leaving the one - armed spiral pattern in the outer part of figure[fig : chm ] ( middle panel ) as traced in the hc@xmath0n and co line emissions .    however , the projected binary separation of @xmath17au @xcite is far beyond several stellar radii , where dust grains form and stellar radiation pressures on them accelerate the cse flow to the terminal velocity @xcite .",
    "we speculate that a highly eccentric orbit may allow the companion to pass the acceleration zone , possibly forming a double spiral in the inner part of the cse of cit 6 .",
    "an orbit with the periastron closer than the acceleration zone radius ( assuming 20au ) and the apocenter at @xmath164au requires an eccentricity @xmath165 .    for an eccentric orbit ,",
    "the orbital speed of a mass - losing star is fastest at the periastron .",
    "therefore the accumulated mass ejection to this direction is lower than in other directions . the lack of @xmath1co interarm emission to the west ( along a pa of 270  in figure[fig : prf ] ) , closely resembles the column density map of a highly eccentric orbit model in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g. , the model with an eccentricity of 0.8 ) .",
    "the anisotropic mass loss due to the eccentric orbit alters the gas density particularly in the interarm region , which is similar to our finding from the @xmath1co brightness radial profiles . in this case",
    ", the periastron would be on the west side .",
    "@xcite further employed a concept of _ periodic _ mass loss enhancement triggered by a _ close _ fly - by companion in their piston model , creating a more complex pattern on the cse .",
    "if this strong tidal interaction model applies to cit 6 , the periastron , at which a larger mass loss could occur , would be on the opposite , east side leading to a higher average intensity .",
    "this situation is less likely for a wide binary like cit 6 , although the necessary binary separation for the strong tidal interaction between the stars is not well studied .",
    "we have observed cit 6 in all possible ( subcompact , compact , extended , and very extended ) array configurations of the sma from 2013 january to 2014 march , and combined with the smt mapping observations on 2015 january .",

    "<S> cit 6 is a carbon star in the transitional phase from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) to the protoplanetary nebulae ( ppn ) . </S>",
    "<S> observational evidences of two point sources in the optical , circumstellar arc segments in an hc@xmath0n line emission , and a bipolar nebula in near - infrared provide strong support for the presence of a binary companion . </S>",
    "<S> hence , cit 6 is very attractive for studying the role of companions in the agb - ppn transition . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out high resolution @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 observations of cit 6 with the submillimeter array combined with the submillimeter telescope ( single - dish ) data . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1co channel maps reveal a spiral - shell pattern connecting the hc@xmath0n segments in a continuous form , and an asymmetric outflow corresponding to the near - infrared bipolar nebula . </S>",
    "<S> rotation of the @xmath1co channel peak position may be related to the inner spiral winding and/or the bipolar outflow . </S>",
    "<S> an eccentric orbit binary is suggested for the presences of an anisotropic mass loss to the west and a double spiral pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of interarm emission to the west may indicate a feature corresponding to the periastron passage of a highly eccentric orbit of the binary . </S>",
    "<S> spatially - averaged radial and spectral profiles of @xmath1co @xmath2=21 and @xmath3co @xmath2=21 are compared with simple spherical radiative transfer models , suggesting a change of @xmath1co/@xmath3co abundance ratio from @xmath4 to @xmath5 inward in the cse of cit 6 . </S>",
    "<S> the millimeter continuum emission is decomposed into extended dust thermal emission ( spectral index @xmath6 ) and compact emission from radio photosphere ( spectral index @xmath7 ) . </S>"
