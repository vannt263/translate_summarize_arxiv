    "the rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars are magnetic main sequence stars that pulsate in high radial overtone p  modes with periods in the range of @xmath2min .",
    "they show broad - band photometric amplitudes less than 0.01mag , whereas rapid radial velocity variations in rare earth element lines can reach several kms@xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the roap stars are important targets for the study of the interactions among chemical anomalies , magnetic field and pulsations .",
    "these stars show abnormal atmospheric structure with chemical stratification ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsations of these stars also make them promising objects for interior model testing using asteroseismology ( @xcite ) .",
    "the roap stars were discovered by @xcite ; at present more than 40 such stars are known .",
    "interesting and surprising discoveries have been made in recent years , which give new insight in the study of pulsating ap stars .",
    "new ground is being broken with @xmath3mag precision photometric data from the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "@xcite discovered a roap star that pulsates in both high overtone pmodes and a low- frequency gmode , opening up the possibility of better modelling of the interiors of these most peculiar stars .    in 2007",
    "we started a high resolution survey of cool chemically peculiar stars based mostly on the photometric catalogue of @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of the survey is to select stars with high peculiarity and strong magnetic field , and to determine their fundamental parameters to select the most promising candidates to be roap stars .",
    "nearly 400 stars have been observed and many of them are good roap candidates for further high time resolution spectroscopic and photometric observations . for several of these stars",
    "we have obtained such observations and here we present the discovery of pulsations for two objects , hd69013 and hd96237 .",
    "both stars were in the list of stars with magnetically split spectral lines found by @xcite .",
    "hd69013 is a typical cool ap star ; hd96237 is more impressive with significant spectral variability .",
    "the physical parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 indicate that hd69013 and hd96237 are both main sequence stars , situated in the hr diagram where the instability strip crosses the main sequence . for many ap stars in this region of main sequence rapid oscillations",
    "have been detected , therefore both stars were promising objects for pulsation testing .",
    "high time resolution spectroscopic observations were carried out at the european southern observatory ( eso ) using the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) installed at unit telescope 2 ( ut2 ) of the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "for hd69013 , data were obtained during two high time resolution observing runs on 2008 january 17 and february 6 . for each run 34",
    "spectra were obtained with exposure times of 80s and readout and overhead times of @xmath6s , corresponding to a time resolution of @xmath7101s .",
    "for hd96237 we obtained 34 spectra on 2008 march 15 with the same exposure and readout times .",
    "the wavelength region observed is @xmath8 , with a small gap in the region around 6000  caused by the space between the two ccds .",
    "the average spectral resolution is about @xmath9 .",
    "the ccd frames were processed using the uves pipeline to extract and merge the echelle orders to 1d spectra that were normalised to the continuum .",
    "we also obtained photometric observations of hd69013 and hd96237 in january , february and may 2010 .",
    "these observations were obtained at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) in johnson @xmath10 filter with the 1-m telescope and saao ccd and ste4 detector and with the modular photometer at the 0.5-m telescope .",
    "the reduction of photometric observations was done with eso - midas software and with software developed at saao .",
    "the lists of the observations are shown in tables1 and 2 .",
    ".a journal of observations of hd69013 .",

    "for roap stars lines of rare earth elements show higher pulsation amplitudes , while the lines of other chemical species , including light elements and iron peak elements , show much smaller pulsation amplitude , or show none at all ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this strange behaviour is explained by stratification where rare earth elements concentrate in the upper layers of the stellar atmosphere where oscillation amplitudes reach a maximum , while most other chemical elements tend to concentrate in deeper layers where the pulsation amplitude is lower .",
    "lines of iron peak elements in roap stars show very low pulsation amplitude or none at all ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    to search for rapid radial velocity variability we performed cross - correlation of sections of the spectrum using eso - midas software .",
    "we also measured the central positions for profiles of individual spectral lines by the centre of gravity method .",
    "frequency analyses of radial velocity and photometric time series were performed using eso - midas s time series analysis and a discrete fourier transform programme by @xcite .",
    "cross correlation for the spectral band @xmath11  with an average spectrum taken as a template shows obvious rapid oscillations for hd69013 , as can be seen in fig.[69013:freq1 ] .",
    "for the two independent observing data sets that we obtained with the eso vlt telescope we find in the amplitude spectra highest peaks at @xmath12mhz and @xmath13mhz , correspondingly , with a full - width - half - maximum uncertainty of 0.07mhz . hence these two independent peaks are at the same frequency within the frequency error .",
    "the spectral lines of the rare earth elements also show pulsation with different amplitudes .",
    "the highest amplitude we detected was obtained for lines of priii , shown in fig.[69013:priii ] , while lines of ndiii reveal a smaller amplitude as shown in fig.[69013:ndiii ] .",
    "the other lines which belong to euii , ceii , laii also show pulsations with significant peaks in the amplitude spectra .    the pulsation amplitude is smaller for the second observing run , which suggests either rotational modulation or multiperiodicity .",
    "while many ap stars show rotational light variations caused by abundance spots usually associated with their magnetic poles , there is no such evidence yet found for hd69013 @xcite .",
    "this constraint is weak and does not rule out rotational modulation pulsation amplitudes .",
    "further observations are needed to study this question .",
    "the photometric observations of this star obtained at saao also show rapid oscillations , as can be seen in fig.[69013:saao ] .",
    "previous photometric observations by @xcite and @xcite did not detect variations in this star .",
    "the amplitude spectra of our saao photometric observations are shown in fig.4 .",
    "we obtained data on two nights .",
    "the first data sets shows a signal at the same frequency as for the radial velocity data , but there is no significant peak in the second data set , as can be seen in fig.4 .      the case for pulsation in hd96237",
    "is not as strong as for hd69013 , but all of the evidence together gives confidence that pulsation has been detected and this star is a roap star .",
    "the five panels of fig.[96237:ampspec ] show amplitude spectra for spectroscopic analysis of hd96237 .",
    "clear pulsation peaks were obtained from cross correlation for the spectral region @xmath14  using an average spectrum as a reference template , and for the core of the h@xmath0 line .    as mentioned above , the spectrum of hd96237 is very rich in rare earth element lines .",
    "we tried to measure pulsations for individual spectral lines which were identified by comparison with synthetic spectra calculated with the synth code of @xcite , but found that the pulsation amplitude is too low for clear detection in most individual lines , given the noise level in our spectra and relatively short observing run . in a few spectral lines of rare earth elements a peak corresponding the pulsation frequency detected by cross correlation",
    "is visible in the amplitude spectrum , as can be seen in the third panel of fig.[96237:ampspec ] for a single ceii line .",
    "the combination of several good spectral lines reduces the noise level and produces a more reliable picture .",
    "the two lower panels in fig.[96237:ampspec ] show amplitude spectra for combinations of five rare earth elements lines giving a clear peak . for twelve lines of fei and feii",
    "no pulsation is detectable , as is typical of the roap stars .    as a further test we examined a combination of several telluric lines and found that there is no signal above a noise level of 12ms@xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that the case that hd96237 is a roap star is good .",
    "further studies  particularly at the rotation phase where the pulsation amplitude is highest  will give more confidence .",
    "photometric observations were obtained at saao for additional testing of pulsations in hd96237 .",
    "the frequency analysis of the photometric data listed in table  1 is presented in fig.[96237:phot ] .",
    "the upper panel of this figure supports the pulsation period found by spectroscopy , but other photometric observations shown in the bottom four panels and by @xcite do not detect pulsation in this star .",
    "this can be understood in terms of rotational modulation in an oblique pulsator , and/or beating of multiple frequencies .",
    "the pulsation amplitudes in many roap stars are modulated with the rotation period of the star . thus some of the photometric observations may not have been in best aspect . to judge this",
    "the rotational period and ephemeris of hd96237 needs to be determined .",
    "from the all sky automated survey ( asas ) and hipparcos photometry , @xcite found photometric variations with a period of 20.91d , which may be the rotational period . using two seasons of data from the wasp ( wide angle search for planets ) project ( @xcite ) covering the intervals 2007 january 4 to 2007 june 3 and 2008 january 5 to 2008 may 28 we obtained a similar period . combining the wasp ( passband from 400 to 700 nm ) and asas ( v - band ) photometry we find the following rotational ephemeris for the photometric maximum :    @xmath15",
    "the rotational phases calculated from this ephemeris are also shown in fig.[96237:phot ] .",
    "the bottom panel is for data observed in the same rotation period as the upper panel , but does not display any pulsations .",
    "the spectral observations presented at fig.[96237:ampspec ] were also obtained at a similar rotation phase using the above ephemeris .",
    "assuming our case for pulsation in this star to be good , we suggest two possible solutions : 1 ) the rotation period may be not 20.91d , but double that .",
    "this ambiguity happens for some peculiar stars ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "longitudinal magnetic field measurements over the rotational period can resolve this ; 2 ) the star may be multiperiodic .",
    "there is some hint in fig.[96237:phot ] of a peak at 0.79mhz .",
    "additional observations are required to resolve these questions .",
    "the chemically peculiar magnetic star hd96237 is an interesting object which has a very peculiar spectrum with significant spectral variability .",
    "the star demonstrates large overabundances of rare earth elements . a high resolution spectrum obtained with the eso 2.2-m telescope and feros spectrograph resembles the spectrum of another highly peculiar star , hd101065 .",
    "abundances of ndii and ndiii determined from this spectrum are even higher than in hd101065",
    ". other rare earth elements also show large overabundances similar to those found in hd101065 .",
    "another spectrum of the star obtained with vlt uves was significantly different from the feros spectrum with much less intense spectral lines of the rare earth elements ( @xcite ) .",
    "the similarity of the spectra and chemical abundances of hd96237 to those of hd101065 , which was the first detected rapidly oscillating ap star , increases the interest of this star .",
    "it is not known what determines the pulsation amplitude of the roap stars .",
    "while the principal periods of hd96237 and hd101065 are similar ( 13.6min and 12.1min , respectively ) , their photometric and spectroscopic radial velocity amplitudes are very different .",
    "our results for hd69013 demonstrate clearly that this is a new roap star with a low pulsation amplitude .",
    "this star shows possible rotation modulation and may be a useful target to study pulsation behaviour over rotation period .",
