    "in recent years there is a surge of interest in studying mixed systems , with both regular and chaotic regions coexisting in phase space .",
    "mixed systems are important as a majority of dynamical systems found in nature fall in this category .",
    "one of the outstanding problems is to resolve how chaotic orbits are influenced by regular regions in the long time limit . in this direction of study ,",
    "two dimensional area - preserving maps are promising candidates as they exhibit many generic features",
    ". a text book paradigm of this kind is the standard map of kicked rotor @xcite . for certain values of system parameter",
    ", this map possesses special kind of orbits called _ accelerator modes _",
    "( am ) @xcite . if an initial state of the rotor corresponds to the am , then it is uniformly accelerated after each kick . in other words ,",
    "momentum of the rotor increases linearly with time .",
    "this is to be contrasted with generic chaotic orbits that diffuse in momentum , i.e. , momentum variance of an ensemble of chaotic orbits increases linearly in time leading to _",
    "normal diffusion_.    am are seen in phase space as small regular islands embedded in a chaotic sea .",
    "they are separated from chaotic region by cantori ( partial - barriers ) .",
    "if a chaotic orbit enters through the cantori , it sticks to the cantori for very long time and thus is accelerated along with the modes .",
    "considering @xmath0 as time , such a long excursion of a chaotic orbit is an example of _ lvy flight _ @xcite .",
    "lvy flight , some times called as _ super diffusion _",
    ", is characterized by @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "am assisted anomalous transport of this kind has been already studied with different motivations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the above mechanism of anomalous effect is numerically ascertained .",
    "further studies have shown that these modes influence corresponding quantum system as well @xcite .",
    "in particular , the existence of regular islands in chaotic sea significantly alter the localization of quasienergy states in angular momentum , leading to enhancement in quantum transport .",
    "developments on confining atoms in magneto - optical traps have opened experimental feasibility for atom - optics realizations of the kicked rotor .",
    "one such realization , in which an ensemble of cold cesium atoms are exposed to a periodically pulsed standing wave light , has shown that for certain values of the kick amplitude the momentum distribution of the atomic sample is non - exponentially localized @xcite .",
    "this then is shown as an effect of am in the quantum system , in contrast to the generic exponential localization .",
    "semiconductor based technological developments , on the other hand , have shown that it is possible to fabricate potential wells on atomic scales .",
    "motion of electrons in such quantum wells in presence of an external electromagnetic field has been studied for experimental signatures of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "a simple model of this kind is a particle confined in a one - dimensional infinite square well exposed to a time periodic pulse field .",
    "this system is known to be one generalization of the kicked rotor @xcite .",
    "the virtue of this generalization arises from two length scales of the system , namely , width of the well and field wavelength .",
    "if the well width is an integer multiple of the field wavelength , kick to kick dynamics of the particle is equivalent to that of the rotor .",
    "otherwise , the dynamics is described by a discontinuous map resulting in a new scenario for transition to chaos even for weak field strengths @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore this model in the context of am .",
    "we show that , our generalization leads to a larger parametric space , in comparison to the standard map , for existence of the am .",
    "we demonstrate that when the border of am ( which we call a `` beach '' ) exposes a chain of islands of a lower order resonance , `` stickiness '' of the beach increases significantly leading to anomalous transport .",
    "we also study the signature of such classical phenomena in the corresponding quantum system .",
    "let us consider a particle confined in an one - dimensional infinite square well potential @xmath3 of width @xmath4 and the hamiltonian is @xmath5    the particle is subjected to a time periodic pulsed field of period @xmath6 .",
    "the perturbed system is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are strength and wavelength of the field respectively ; a train of delta functions accomplishes the time periodic pulse .",
    "kick to kick dynamics of the particle can be described by the map @xmath10 p_{n+1}&=&{(-1)}^{b_n } p_n + { k\\over 2\\pi } \\sin(2 \\pi rx_{n+1 } ) \\ , , \\label{cmap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 $ ] ; @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 stand for integer part and sign of the argument respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the number of bounces of the particle between the walls during the interval between @xmath0th and @xmath15th kick .",
    "this dimensionless map is related to physical variables by the scaling : @xmath16    where @xmath17 is effective field strength and @xmath18 is ratio of two length scales of the system .",
    "henceforth we refer to the classical mapping ( [ cmap ] ) as the _",
    "well map_.    the well map can be studied by invoking a _ generalized standard map _ ( gsm ) @xmath19 { \\theta}_{n+1}&=&{\\theta}_{n}+j_{n+1 } \\hspace*{0.6 cm } ( \\mbox{mod}\\;\\;1 ) \\",
    ", , \\label{gsm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since time reversal of gsm and ( [ cmap ] ) are quantitatively related .",
    "gsm is defined on a cylinder @xmath20 and the standard map is a special case with @xmath21 .",
    "a detailed study of gsm can be found in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the gsm is highly chaotic for strong field strength ( large @xmath17 ) .",
    "in addition , it exhibits chaotic motion even for weak field strength ( small @xmath17 ) depending on the parameter @xmath18 . in order to study the am in the well map , we invoke the gsm which is amenable to a detailed analysis .",
    "periodicity of the gsm in @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( with unit period ) implies existence of am .",
    "these are located at ( @xmath24 ) : @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integers .",
    "they are also termed as step-@xmath28 am as the acceleration is @xmath28 at each iteration .",
    "fixed points belong to the family of am with @xmath29 . for stable am ,",
    "required stability condition is @xmath30    and using ( [ amc ] ) this becomes @xmath31    this inequality can also be rewritten as @xmath32 where @xmath33    for stable am @xmath34    where @xmath35 is an integer .",
    "thus the am are characterized by two integers @xmath27 and @xmath35 and we call them as @xmath36 type modes . since the cylindrical phase space of gsm has the constraint @xmath37 ( equivalent to restriction of the particle dynamics to between walls of the well ) , zero can not be lower limit in the above inequality .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 in gsm is recognized as frequency of the sinusoidal force term .",
    "as @xmath18 increases from zero @xmath38 decreases such that @xmath39 type modes first appear in the phase space followed by the @xmath40 type . in a similar way ,",
    "as @xmath18 decreases @xmath38 increases such that @xmath40 type is the first to disappear from the phase space while the @xmath39 type mode is the last to disappear . hence , lowest limit for the inequality ( [ amr ] )",
    "is set by the disappearance of @xmath39 type modes . from eqn .",
    "( [ theta ] ) , the constraint @xmath41 for @xmath39 becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 thus the inequality ( [ amr ] ) is replaced by @xmath44    we emphasize that both the inequalities ( [ amk ] ) and ( [ amrr ] ) must be simultaneously satisfied for existence of am in the phase space .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard map for which the inequality ( [ amk ] ) with @xmath21 itself is sufficient .",
    "thus the two control parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , provide a larger parametric space , in comparison to that of the standard map , for the existence of am . at @xmath45 , the lower bound of the inequality ( [ amk ] ) , @xmath46 and",
    "this is the minimum possible value of @xmath47 . in other words , for @xmath48 am do not exist .",
    "in fact , gsm is hyperbolic for @xmath48 and there are only unstable orbits in the phase space .",
    "since the well map and the gsm are quantitatively related , location of am are same for both the maps i.e. , @xmath49 and all the above arguments hold for well map also .",
    "however , am of the well map differ only in the following way due to the reflective boundary condition .",
    "when particle is on the am , @xmath0th kick causes the particle to undergo @xmath0 bounces between the walls .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd momentum changes its sign , in turn sign of the particle position is also flipped .",
    "phase space of a mixed system generally has many intricate structures .",
    "in particular , boundaries of regular region embedded in chaotic sea have structures at all scales and all of them are hard to discern .",
    "stable am islands are believed to be separated from the remaining chaotic region by cantori ( partial - barriers ) .",
    "phase space in the vicinity of the cantori is sticky as it retains long time correlations .",
    "when chaotic orbits explore all parts of the phase space , there are occasions that they pass through the cantori .",
    "when such an event occurs , chaotic orbits stick to the vicinity of cantori for long time .",
    "thus they are dragged along the modes ballistically @xcite .",
    "this is a mechanism which is known to enhance momentum transport .",
    "below we demonstrate that the beaches around the am island when occupied by a large resonance of small order are highly sticky .",
    "this in turn implies that the cantori surrounding these must have large gaps to allow larger penetration of itinerant chaotic orbits .",
    "is plotted with respect to the parameter @xmath18 for @xmath50 . to obtain the exponent , an initial ensemble of 10000 phase space points",
    "is iterated by the well map for 5000 time steps . for ( i ) the ensemble consists of points with @xmath51 and @xmath52 distributed uniformly between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the range of @xmath18 given by the eqn .",
    "( [ amrr ] ) with @xmath55 and @xmath56 is seen as @xmath57 due to ballistic evolution of the accelerating points contained in the ensemble .",
    "for ( ii ) the ensemble is chosen from chaotic region of the phase space .",
    "maximum exponent observed for @xmath58 , marked by circle , is due to the beaches around the am island . ]    before we dwell more on am assisted super diffusion , it is instructive to look at some of the modes of the well map .",
    "[ am6 ] shows islands for different @xmath18 values . in the given range of phase space",
    "we find one @xmath59 type mode for @xmath60 and 1 .",
    "as @xmath18 increases the islands move towards interior of the well . for @xmath61 ,",
    "one more mode just appears at boundary of the well .",
    "this is a @xmath62 type mode . for further large values of @xmath18 both the types",
    "fully appear and they move into the interior of the well . evidently , parameter @xmath18 also changes the size of the islands .    in order to quantify the role of @xmath18 in",
    "am assisted anomalous transport , we consider @xmath63 . here",
    "the angular bracket stands for an ensemble average and the exponent can be evaluated by iterating an ensemble of phase space points for long time under the well map .",
    "we perform numerical calculations for two different initial ensembles : ( i ) phase space points uniformly distributed along the line @xmath51 which correspond to _ both _ accelerator and chaotic orbits ;",
    "( ii ) phase space points from a chaotic region which include _ only _ chaotic orbits .",
    "the ensemble ( i ) contains more chaotic orbits than the regular ( accelerator ) orbits .",
    "chaotic orbits exhibit normal diffusion in momentum i.e. , like the random walk , until they are dragged along the mode . on the other hand , the accelerator orbits exhibit ballistic behaviour ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "hence , in the long time limit , evolution of accelerator orbits dominate the ensemble average .",
    "[ gama1](i ) , shows the characteristic exponent @xmath65 for different @xmath18 values . as we see , for the range of @xmath18 in eqn .",
    "( [ amrr ] ) @xmath57 , confirming the existence of am islands . here",
    "the lesser @xmath65 for @xmath66 is attributed to small size of am ( see fig .",
    "[ am6 ] ) . on contrary , for parameters outside the range of eqn .",
    "( [ amrr ] ) , diffusion is normal as there are no am in the phase space .",
    "[ gama1](ii ) corresponds to the ensemble which contains only chaotic orbits . within the parametric range where am exist ,",
    "the exponent @xmath65 shows large fluctuations .",
    "there are also occasions wherein presence of am does not enhance the diffusion significantly .",
    "it is natural to attribute the observed fluctuations to size of the islands and stickiness of their neighbourhood .",
    "that is , big am islands with very sticky neighbourhood can significantly enhance the transport .    for @xmath58",
    ", the exponent @xmath65 is found to be maximum ( @xmath67 ) . as seen from fig .",
    "[ am6 ] , in this case am island is surrounded by a chain of @xmath68 resonance zones .",
    "these zones are also step-1 accelerators and they are separated from chaotic region by their boundary , the so called `` beaches '' .",
    "dynamics on the beach is chaotic , but very sticky with longer classical staying time .",
    "if a wandering chaotic orbit happens to approach the beach region , it stays there for long time and thus gets accelerated along the modes resulting in very large enhancement in momentum transport .",
    "this maximum transport is a generic behaviour i.e. , independent of choice of the chaotic ensemble . from fig .",
    "[ am6 ] we note that , although size of the am for @xmath69 is larger than that for @xmath58 , exponent @xmath65 is maximum for the latter .",
    "this shows that the emergence of lower order resonance zones are chiefly responsible for the stickiness of the beach regions , leading to am assisted anomalous transport .",
    "thus the well map or equivalently gsm has a control parameter @xmath18 by tuning which am induced super diffusion can be maximized .",
    "more over , longer the period of resonance zones lesser the stickiness of associated beach regions . upon magnifying boundaries of",
    "am islands for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we found long chain of resonance zones and their beach regions .",
    "as seen from fig .",
    "[ gama1 ] ( ii ) , enhancement is limited for both these cases .",
    "further , we explore step-2 am which are smaller in size than the step-1 modes .",
    "we choose @xmath71 and step-2 modes exist in the range @xmath72 . nearly ballistic evolution in this range and the otherwise normal diffusion",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ gama2](i ) . in fig .",
    "[ gama2](ii ) the exponent exhibits large fluctuations . in order to appreciate the role of beach regions in large scale transport , we focus our attention on two distinct cases where the exponent shows a minimum and a maximum .     is plotted with respect to the parameter @xmath18 for @xmath71 .",
    "rest of the calculation details are similar to the fig .",
    "[ gama1 ] . in ( i ) the range of @xmath18 given by the eqn .",
    "( [ amrr ] ) with @xmath73 and @xmath74 is seen as @xmath57 . in",
    "( ii ) the exponents for @xmath58 and 0.9 are marked by circles .",
    "corresponding am islands for these two cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ am2 ] . ]    . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the am island is accompanied by a chain of @xmath76 resonance zones and sticky beaches . on the other hand ,",
    "am island for @xmath58 is not accompanied by any beach regions . ]    as we see from fig .",
    "[ am2 ] , when the enhancement is minimum ( or absent ) am islands do not have the surrounding beach regions . on the other hand , transport is maximum when am island is surrounded by short chain of resonance zones and their beach regions .",
    "these results reinforce that the expose of lower order resonance zones around the am are chiefly responsible for stickiness of the beach and thus the resulting enhanced momentum transport .",
    "analogous to the classical system , the kick to kick quantum dynamics can be studied using quantum map by solving schrdinger equation for one period @xmath6 as @xmath77    where @xmath78 with @xmath79 , being the effective field strength .",

    "is implemented with a finite , say n , number of unperturbed basis states . by obtaining the limit @xmath94",
    "we ensure that such a truncation of basis does not influence the quantum system .    as seen from eqn .",

    "this phenomenon is similar to that of the quantum kicked rotor @xcite .",
    "an earlier study has shown that quantum resonance of kicked rotor occurs when @xmath95 is rational multiples of @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this non - generic pure quantum phenomenon does not have any classical analogue . in order to investigate signatures of am in the quantum system ,",
    "it is necessary to suppress the resonance effect .",
    "this can be accomplished by taking @xmath95 as an irrational multiple of @xmath96 .",
    "one natural way to study the quantum signatures of the am is using the time evolution of an initial wave packet localized in chaotic region of the classical phase space .",
    "we take a gaussian wave packet confined in the square well as the initial state . in position representation",
    "it is given by @xmath102    where @xmath103 measures width of the wave packet , centred at @xmath104 with momentum @xmath105 .",
