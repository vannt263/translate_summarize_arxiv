    "black hole x - ray transient binary systems have attracted increasing attention in recent years since they can be used as a probe of the underlying physics of the accretion process in disks surrounding black holes over a wide range in luminosity .",
    "the x - ray spectral behavior of these systems is complex , exhibiting differing states and transitions .",
    "in particular , it is well known that two basic x - ray spectral states are present with a soft spectral state occurring at high luminosities and a hard spectral state occurring at low luminosities .",
    "the properties of these systems have been reviewed by tanaka & shibazaki ( 1996 ) and more recently by remillard & mcclintock ( 2006 ) and mcclintock & remillard ( 2006 ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that these two spectral states originate from different accretion modes dependent on the mass accretion rate .    at high luminosities ,",
    "black hole x - ray transients are characterized by a soft thermal spectrum described by a multi - color black body component dominant at about 1 kev .",
    "this has been interpreted as arising from an optically thick accretion disk extending to the innermost stable circular orbit ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "in contrast , at low luminosities , the systems are characterized by a hard spectral state where the spectrum is described by a power law with a typical photon index of about 1.7 .",
    "the emission is commonly thought to be produced by the compton scattering of soft photons with the hot electrons in an optically thin inner disk ( shapiro et al .",
    "1976 ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; pozdnyaknov et al .",
    "1983 ) . in these models ,",
    "the ions and electrons are described by a two temperature plasma . here , the ions are heated to high temperatures by viscous dissipation , the electrons to attain lower temperatures due to their strong interaction with radiation and weak coulomb coupling with ions .",
    "the initial models developed for this state ( shapiro et al .",
    "1976 ) were thermally unstable , and it has been recognized that the radial advection of internal energy can stabilize the flow ( see , for example , narayan 2005 ) . in this case , the internal energy is advected inward with the flow , resulting in an inefficient conversion of gravitational potential energy to radiation ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 ; narayan & yi 1995a , b ) .",
    "the radius of transition between the cool outer disk and the hot advection - dominated inner disk was not theoretically determined , but obtained by fits to the observational data ( see esin et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the transition between these states occurs at luminosities in the range of @xmath2 of the eddington value ( maccarone 2003 ) and is thought to be a consequence of a disk corona interaction ( meyer , liu , & meyer - hofmeister 2000b ) .",
    "more detailed observations and analyses indicated that , in addition to the soft and hard state , an intermediate state could occur during the rise or decay of an outburst between the hard and soft state . here , both a soft thermal spectrum and a hard power law spectrum are observed , likely indicating the coexistence of a hot optically thin and cool optically thick disk structure .",
    "such a disk structure can be envisaged if the optically thick disk is truncated by some evaporative process , leading to the formation of an inner hot geometrically thick , optically thin disk surrounded by an outer cool geometrically thin disk .",
    "originally , the idea of a two phase accretion structure was suggested by eardley et al .",
    "( 1975 ) and shapiro et al .",
    "such disk geometries have recently been calculated based on a proton bombardment model ( dullemond & spruit 2005 ) and a coronal evaporation model controlled by electron conduction ( liu et al . 1999 ,",
    "ranska & czerny 2000a , b ) . in the latter case a maximum evaporation rate",
    "was found which allowed an estimate of a smallest transition radius and a maximal mass flow rate for which the evaporation rate into the corona can still exceed the mass flow rate in the cool outer disk ( liu et al .",
    "alternatively liu , meyer , & meyer - hofmeister ( 2006 ) and meyer , liu , & meyer - hofmeister ( 2007 ) have suggested that a remnant cool inner disk formed during the thermally dominant ( soft ) spectral state , when the accretion rate declines just below the transition rate , can be maintained for times longer than a viscous diffusion time by condensation of matter from the corona .",
    "the accretion geometry then would be described as a cool inner and even cooler outer disk separated by a gap filled with an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( fig .",
    "[ f : dsk - cor.ps ] , see also mayer & pringle 2007 ) . here",
    ", the inner cool disk is responsible for the presence of the soft thermal component coexisting with the hard component formed in the coronal region .",
    "recently , evidence pointing to the possible presence of a cool inner disk during the low hard state of black hole transient systems has been provided by observations of gx 339 - 4 and swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( miller et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .",
    "in particular , miller et al .",
    "( 2006a ) find that a soft thermal component ( @xmath3 kev ) is required to fit the spectrum of j1753.5 - 0127 , with a normalization suggesting a small inner disk region .",
    "similarly , a soft thermal component characterized by kt @xmath4 kev was required for gx 339 - 4 ( miller et al .",
    "2006b ) . in this latter case",
    ", a broad fe k line was also required to fit the spectrum , providing additional evidence to support the hypothesis of cold matter lying close to the black hole .",
    "we note that this interpretation is model dependent since it is possible that the emission line may have formed in an outflowing wind ( laurent & titarchuk 2007 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of such an inner cold disk region is very suggestive .",
    "such a picture may be consistent with the accretion geometry envisaged by liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and meyer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , or cold clumps in luminous hot accretion flows ( yuan 2003 )",
    ". however , miller et al . ( 2006a ) find evidence for a soft component from a weak disk extending to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) at x - ray luminosities as low as 0.003 @xmath5 , significantly less than the luminosity corresponding to the transition between the high soft and low hard states .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the properties of a cool inner disk within the framework of the coronal evaporation and recondensation model , extending earlier work by liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and meyer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , to determine whether cool disks are present at low x - ray luminosities .",
    "in contrast to liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and meyer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we include the cooling effect associated with the inverse compton scattering of photons emitted by an underlying disk on hot thermal electrons for determining the thermal state of the corona . assuming that thermal conduction determines the energy and mass exchange between corona and underlying cool disk",
    ", we examine the range of conditions under which a cool inner disk forms and is maintained . in the next section we give an overview of the evaporation / condensation model , including the additional input physics . in ",
    "3 illustrative results are presented for the case where the cooling of electrons is dominated by heat conduction to the underlying disk and for the case where electron cooling is dominated by compton scattering of cool photons . to illustrate the potential applicability of these concepts to observed sources , we compare the numerical results to the x - ray observations of the black hole candidate source gx 339 - 4 and the recently discovered system swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( palmer et al . 2005 ) in  4 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and their implications in the last section .",
    "the formation of a corona above a geometrically thin disk may result from physical processes similar to those operating in the solar corona or from a thermal instability ( e.g. , shaviv & wehrse 1986 ) in the uppermost layers of a disk . as mentioned above , earlier work ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; meyer , liu , & meyer - hofmeister 2000a , liu et al .",
    "2002 ; raska & czerny 2000a , b ) revealed that a disk corona fed by the evaporation of matter from an underlying cool disk can be maintained as an accreting coronal flow .",
    "the description of the mechanism responsible for the evaporation is briefly described below .    in the corona",
    ", the viscous dissipation leads to ion heating , which is partially transferred to the electrons via coulomb collisions .",
    "this energy is assumed to be conducted into a lower , cooler transition layer .",
    "if the density in this layer is sufficiently high , the conductive flux is radiated away . on the other hand ,",
    "if the density is insufficient to efficiently radiate the energy , the underlying cool gas is heated and evaporation into the corona takes place .",
    "the evaporated matter carries angular momentum , and it gradually accretes onto the central black hole as a result of viscous transport . as the accreted gas is resupplied by the material evaporated from the cool disk , a steady accreting corona is formed above the disk in which a balance of evaporation and accretion is achieved .",
    "while the disk evaporation provides matter for accretion in the corona , the mass accretion through the cool outer disk is decreased and can even vanish at distances where the inflowing rate is lower than the evaporation rate , approximated by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the evaporation rate per unit area from the disk into the corona .",
    "numerical calculations ( meyer et al . 2000a ; liu et al .",
    "2002 ) reveal that the evaporation rate increases with decreasing distance to the central object until a maximum evaporation rate of about a percent of the eddington rate is reached at a distance of several hundred schwarzschild radii .",
    "the existence of such a maximum leads to a change in character of the accretion geometry .",
    "if the mass flow in the disk is below this maximum value , as in the quiescent state of black hole x - ray transients , the optically thick disk is truncated at the distance where all matter is evaporated , leaving a pure advection dominated coronal flow . as the mass flow rate increases ( e.g. , during the rise to an outburst ) , the edge of the cool optically thick disk moves inward .",
    "if the mass flow in the disk increases above the maximal evaporation rate , the disk can not be evaporated completely and , hence , the cool disk extends to the isco . during the decline from the peak of the outburst , the inner edge of the cool disk retreats outwards to greater distances from the central black hole .",
    "these variations in the accretion process during the outburst of a black hole x - ray transient system provide explanation for the hard and soft states in these systems ( meyer et al .",
    "recent investigations ( liu et al .",
    "2006 ; meyer et al . 2007 ) furthermore reveal that when the accretion rate is not far below the maximal evaporation rate an inner disk separated from the outer disk by a coronal region could also exist , leading to an intermediate state of black hole accretion .",
    "the onset of an intermediate state occurs as the accretion rate decreases just below the maximal evaporation rate . at this time",
    ", disk truncation by evaporation sets in near the region where the evaporation rate is maximal .",
    "a coronal gap appears and widens with a further decrease in the accretion rate with the inner cool disk reduced in extent .",
    "because of diffusion , the inner disk can not survive for a time longer than a viscous time ( which is only a few days in the inner disk ) unless matter continuously condenses from the adaf onto the cool inner disk . in the following",
    "we investigate the interaction between the disk and the corona / adaf , showing the conditions under which matter condenses onto the inner disk , thereby maintaining a cool disk in the inner region .",
    "the corona lying above an inner cool disk is similar to an adaf .",
    "the main physical differences between these two descriptions stem from the existence of vertical thermal conduction caused by the large temperature gradient between the corona and the disk and the presence of cool disk photons , which upon propagating through the corona remove energy by inverse compton scattering . at low accretion rates , neither conduction nor",
    "compton scattering is important for energy loss and the corona is described by an adaf . in this study",
    ", we assume that the corona above the cool disk can be described by an adaf , where the structure ( such as pressure , density , and ion temperature ) is determined by the mass of the black hole , the mass accretion rate , and the viscosity at a given distance ( narayan & yi 1995a ) .",
    "however , the cooling in such an adaf is assumed to be either dominated by the compton scattering of the disk photons or dominated by vertical heat conduction .",
    "that is , we implicitly assume that non - thermal ( e.g. , synchrotron ) processes are unimportant in the lowest level of approximation . as we shall see , such a simple model contains the ingredients necessary to provide an understanding of the soft spectrum in the low / hard state .",
    "the model allows an analytical description , revealing the dependence of the disk size , effective temperature , luminosity , and spectrum on the black hole mass , mass accretion rate , and disk viscosity .",
    "the condensation from a corona where cooling results mainly from conduction has been studied in earlier works by liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and meyer et al .",
    "we introduce the main results here for completeness and for comparison to the case where the cooling by the inverse compton scattering process is dominant ( see  2.3 ) . in the bulk of the corona the thermal state of the ions",
    "is not significantly affected by conductive cooling of the electrons until the electron temperature has become low enough near the base of the corona so that collisional coupling between the ions and electrons becomes effective . from this coupling interface",
    "down to the upper layers of the cool disk the ion temperature , @xmath8 , and electron temperature , @xmath9 , no longer differ .",
    "this results in a dramatic decline of @xmath8 , leading to a significant increase in density as the pressure in the vertical extent changes little in comparison to the change in temperature . as a consequence ,",
    "bremsstrahlung energy losses become much more important in this layer than in a typical adaf . henceforth , this layer is referred to as the radiating layer .",
    "the pressure in the adaf is of particular interest since it determines whether evaporation or condensation takes place .",
    "for example , at sufficiently high pressure , bremsstrahlung can be so efficient that not only is all the heat drained from the adaf by thermal conduction radiated away , but also the gas in the radiating layer is further cooled , leading to condensation onto the disk . on the other hand , if the pressure in the upper corona is sufficiently low so that the density in the radiating layer is too low to radiate away the conductive flux , disk matter is evaporated into the corona .",
    "we adopt for our analysis the values derived by narayan & yi ( 1995b ) .",
    "the adaf pressure , density , viscous heating rate , and sound speed depend on the viscosity parameter , @xmath10 , black hole mass , @xmath11 , the accretion rate , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 the distance from the black hole in the form ( see narayan & yi 1995b ) , @xmath14 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in units of solar mass , eddington rate ( @xmath15 g / s ) , and schwarzschild radius , respectively .",

    "as remarked earlier , the influence of the magnetic field on the vertical conduction is not discussed in our present analysis .",
    "furthermore , the effects of irradiation and disk reflection are assumed to be unimportant since it is not expected to be significant for the small size of the weakly emitting inner disk that is characteristic for the low / hard state although it can lead to additional heating of the disk ( see  5 ) .",

    ", we consider a system with a black hole mass of @xmath112 and a viscosity parameter @xmath131 , but assume a higher mass accretion rate @xmath132 . as discussed in  3.1 , compton cooling is expected to be an important cooling process in the inner region .",
    "calculations based on conduction alone would yield condensation from the isco up to @xmath133 , resulting in a condensation rate of @xmath134 times the eddington rate .",
    "this leads to a maximal effective temperature of the inner disk of 0.14 kev ( eq.[t_eff ] ) .",
    "at such a temperature , compton cooling becomes important from @xmath135 until @xmath136 ( as calculated from eq.[r_cmp ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the case of @xmath131 and @xmath132 , cooling in the corona is dominated by the compton scattering in the inner region and the vertical conduction in the surrounding region . by presuming a value for the disk effective temperature , we calculate the condensation rate from eqs.[r_cnd2]-[b ] and derive the effective temperature from eq.[t_eff ] .",
    "if this temperature matches the presumed value , the solution for the condensation rate is self - consistent . by iteration",
    "we find a consistent solution for the total condensation rate , @xmath137 , obtained by integration from an inner compton dominant region ( @xmath138 ) and an outer conduction dominant region ( @xmath139 ) , with a disk effective temperature @xmath74=0.15kev at @xmath92 .    in the above example",
    ", compton cooling is not very strong , leading to a slight increase in the rate of condensation .",
    "for very efficient compton cooling , the decrease in the conductive flux results in a significant increase in the condensation rate . to illustrate such a case we assume @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath93 .",
    "for this set of parameters , calculations based on the compton cooling model show that the coronal gas condenses into the disk from @xmath142 to @xmath143 , resulting in a mass condensation rate of @xmath144 .",
    "such a rate leads to a consistent effective temperature of @xmath145kev at @xmath92 .",
    "on the other hand , calculation based on the conduction model shows a condensation rate of only 0.003 , much smaller than predicted by compton cooling .",
    "further calculations of the compton dominant region show that the compton scattering dominates the coronal cooling nearly throughout the condensation - fed inner disk .",
    "examples for various values of the viscosity and accretion rate are listed in table  [ t : examples ] .",
    "it is shown that the conduction cooling leads to low condensation rates and hence low disk temperatures , while the compton cooling results in high condensation rates and hence high effective temperatures .",
    "for comparable viscosity values , the compton cooling becomes efficient at high accretion rates .",
    "neglecting the upper limit to the accretion rates , we show in fig.[f : comparison ] the dependence of the condensation rate on the mass accretion rate for the case of compton dominant cooling in the inner corona and conduction dominant cooling in the outer corona .",
    "condensation caused by conduction alone is also shown for comparison .",
    "it can be seen that the condensation is strong for compton cooling , though it only dominates over conduction in the inner region .",
    "to make a meaningful comparison between observations and theory it is important to recognize that the observations provide information on the luminosity rather than the mass accretion rate . in the case of an optically thick standard thin disk ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is deduced from the luminosity , @xmath146 by assuming an energy conversion efficiency of @xmath147 . however , in an adaf - like corona , @xmath148 is less than 0.1 and its variation depends on the structural disk parameters ( @xmath149 , @xmath9 , etc ) , and therefore is implicitly determined by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . for a compton cooling dominant corona the main contribution to the luminosity is due to inverse compton scattering .",
    "bremsstrahlung radiation from the radiation layer could also contribute , but as a small part .",
    "therefore , with observationally inferred mass and effective temperature , a value for viscosity , and a tentative @xmath12 , we calculate numerically the radiative luminosity from both compton scattering ( eq.[l_cmp ] ) and bremsstrahlung ( eq.[l_cnd ] ) . if the derived luminosity is not equal to the observed value , the accretion rate is varied and the calculation repeated until a consistent luminosity is obtained . in this way , the accretion rate can be found .",
    "the crucial issue in the modeling is whether a value for @xmath12 exists which predicts condensation rather than evaporation .    in the case of a corona dominated by thermal conduction ,",
    "the luminosity is due to bremsstrahlung radiation , and the mass accretion rate only depends on the observed luminosity and the assumed @xmath10 in the form @xmath150^{-3/5},\\ ] ] where the the factor @xmath151^{-3/5}$ ] is approximately unity as long as @xmath152 is not very small .",
    "the inner disk size @xmath57 , the condensation rate , and the effective temperature are thus determined from eq.[r_cnd1 ] , eq.[condensation_cnd ] and eq.[t_eff ] respectively .",
    "we note that the conduction model is based on the assumption that compton cooling is negligible and would only be consistent with the observations for condensation rates yielding low disk temperatures ( from eq.[t_eff ] ) .",
    "a constraint on the viscosity parameter can be obtained from the mass accretion rate corresponding to the transition between spectral states . as shown in previous work by meyer et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , the maximum evaporation rate , representing the hard - soft transition rate , roughly depends on the value of the viscosity parameter as @xmath153 . in the intermediate state",
    "discussed here , the mass accretion rate can not be larger than this transition rate for , otherwise , the optically thick disk extends to the isco without a coronal gap , resulting in a soft thermal dominated spectrum .",
    "based on the optical spectroscopy of gx339 - 4 during outburst , hynes et al .",
    "( 2003 ) infer an orbital period of 1.7557 days and a mass function of @xmath154 for the system . for a likely distance",
    "we take 8 kpc and for the black hole mass @xmath155 ( see zdziarski et al .",
    "recently , miller et al . ( 2006b ) observed gx 339 - 4 during the low hard state with xmm newton and found a soft component of @xmath156kev , interpreting it to arise from an inner disk extending to the isco .",
    "such a weak disk near the black hole is very difficult to explain within the framework of standard accretion disk models . as the density of the reflecting medium inferred from observations is low",
    "( miller et al .",
    "2006b ) , the inner disk must be spatially limited in extent . at these low temperatures , in contrast to the 1 - 2kev spectrum in the soft state , a small inner disk would also be necessary in order that strong irradiation by the corona can be avoided . given an unabsorbed flux of @xmath157 ( miller et al .",
    "2006b ) , the luminosity is @xmath158 . at this luminosity and the characteristic power - law spectrum of gx 339 - 4 in the low hard state",
    ", compton scattering could be dominant .",
    "upon comparing the electron temperature obtained from analysis for the two cooling mechanisms , we confirm that compton cooling is important from the innermost region @xmath159 up to @xmath160 ( by eq.[r_cmp ] ) . even if a colour correction of 1.7 ( shimura & takahara 1995 ) is assumed , the compton cooling is still dominant in the inner region to the distance of @xmath161 .",
    "hence , we consider gx 339 - 4 in terms of the compton dominant condensation model .    with the black hole mass , luminosity , and effective",
    "temperature taken from the observations , and a standard value 0.2 for @xmath10 , it is found that the accretion rate is @xmath162 .",
    "this yields an inner disk extending to a distance of 99.5 schwarzschild and a luminosity ratio of 21.8% between the disk and the corona .",
    "adopting a larger viscous value , @xmath60 , one obtains an accretion rate of 0.037 .",
    "the disk size is @xmath163 and disk luminosity fraction is 12.7% , smaller than the case of standard viscosity value .",
    "a further increase in the viscosity to @xmath140 leads to a smaller inner disk and a lower disk luminosity fraction .",
    "detailed fitting results are presented in table  [ t : fits ] , where for a given value of @xmath10 , a value for @xmath12 is found , which leads to a luminosity consistent with the inferred value .",
    "the corresponding spatial extent of the condensation region , the condensation rate , the effective temperature , as well as the ratio of the disk to corona luminosities are also listed .    by comparing modeling results , we find that a larger viscosity predicts a smaller disk size and disk contribution to the luminosity .",
    "we note that the condensation rate yields an effective temperature ( as shown in column 7 in table  [ t : fits ] ) , which is lower than observed .",
    "this may indicate a need for an additional energy source above that associated with the accretion of condensed gas .",
    "for example , other processes , such as irradiation , may lead to additional heating of the gas in the disk surface . notwithstanding the uncertainties in observationally determining the color temperature of the soft thermal component ,",
    "the lack of agreement may also imply a need for a color correction factor , although , in that case , compton cooling may not be as effective .",
    "we also can compare our model with the recent observations of j1753.5 - 0127 ( miller et al .",
    "2006a ) , however there are significant uncertainties in the distance and mass of the black hole .",
    "our comparisons , thus , should be only considered to be indicative and accurate modeling must await determinations of these parameters .",
    "xmm newton observations of j1753.5 - 0127 reveal a x - ray luminosity of @xmath164 in the range 0.5kev to 10kev and a hard x - ray spectral index of @xmath165 ( miller et al .",
    "2006a ) . extrapolating the luminosity to 100 - 200kev yields @xmath166 .",

    "the size of the inner disk is @xmath172 ( from eq.[r_cnd2 ] ) , while from eq.[r_cnd1 ] @xmath173 .",
    "this implies that condensation begins at @xmath174 due to conduction , while compton cooling sets in at @xmath175 and dominates to @xmath176 . in this case",
    ", the condensation rate is obtained from an integration from the outer conduction dominant region ( @xmath177 ) to the inner compton dominant region ( @xmath178 ) , yielding @xmath179 .",
    "the disk component contributes a relative large fraction ( 0.16 ) to the total luminosity .",
    "a fit to j1753.5 - 0127 with larger viscosities has also been carried out , and the relevant results are listed in table  [ t : fits ] .",
    "the calculations show that at a fixed effective temperature , for larger viscosities the conduction cooling to the corona is less efficient and hence the compton cooling becomes more important .",
    "specifically , the inner disk becomes smaller , the condensation rate decreases , and disk becomes weaker relative to the corona .",
    "future measurements of the disk luminosity fraction and the reflection component will provide further constraints on the viscosity .",
    "the evaporation / condensation picture for the accretion geometry of black hole x - ray transient systems has been investigated to determine its applicability to the weak soft thermal component observed in the low hard states of gx339 - 4 and j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "the model for the mass and energy exchange between the corona and an underlying disk developed earlier , based on the thermal conduction of energy , has been extended to include the effects of coronal cooling associated with the inverse compton scattering process of soft x - ray photons .",
    "the numerical solutions for the disk structure reveal that the compton dominated cooling region is more important for higher soft photon fluxes at all radii , with the radial extent @xmath108 of the region independent of the mass of the accreting black hole component in the system .",
    "in addition , it is found that cool inner disks , contributing a small fraction of the total x - ray luminosity ( @xmath180 ) , can exist in the low hard state of black hole transient systems gx 339 - 4 and j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "the fits to gx 339 - 4 and swift j1753.5 - 0127 reveal that the theoretical disk temperatures are lower than the observationally inferred values , indicating that additional heating of the disk is required .",
    "we suggest that this heating is associated with coronal irradiation .",
    "specifically , for a corona in the form of a slab lying above the disk , nearly half of the total coronal emission impinges on the optically thick disk and is reprocessed as blackbody radiation ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ; liu et al .",
    "the luminosity associated with the irradiation is close to the observed luminosity . for gx 339 - 4 ,",
    "this irradiating luminosity is about 0.03 times the eddington value .",
    "its corresponding heating is equivalent to viscous dissipation in the disk with an additional accretion rate of 0.03 of the eddington value , producing an effective temperature of about 0.27kev ( from eq.[t_eff ] ) .",
    "taking into account the viscous dissipation from the accretion of condensing matter , the inner disk temperature can be similar to the observationally inferred value of 0.3kev .",
    "similarly , for swift j1753.5 - 0127 , @xmath181 , and the disk is heated by irradiation to about 0.2kev , again , comparable to that observed .    the inclusion of irradiation does not affect the fits described in  4 since the disk temperature is fixed to the observed value .",
    "although the effective temperature established by viscous dissipation is lower than 0.3kev , the additional heating from irradiation can lead to improved comparisons between the theoretically derived and observed temperatures .      in the low hard state",
    "the luminosity range over which cool inner disks exist depends on whether condensation can occur . to determine the lower limit to the range we make use of the fact that the critical condensation radius should fulfill the condition that @xmath182 . in the case",
    "that conduction cooling dominates in the corona , this condition requires @xmath183 for a fixed viscosity parameter , @xmath59 , a lower limit to the accretion rate for an inner disk to exist is @xmath184 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity in this critical case is from a pure adaf luminosity ( rather than bremsstrahlung ) , which could be as small as @xmath185 , depending on the radiative efficiency of the adaf accretion . at an accretion rate",
    "slightly higher than the critical value , the disk component , as measured by the disk size or by the disk luminosity fraction for example , could be very weak and hence compton cooling is negligible .",
    "we note that this lower critical mass accretion rate is very sensitive to @xmath10 .    for cases in which compton cooling dominates in the corona , the lower limits to the accretion rate for condensation to a disk are greater than that given by the conduction model for @xmath186 .",
    "in particular , the lower limit to the accretion rate is 0.0245 ( 0.07 ) and to the luminosity is 0.008 ( 0.016 ) for @xmath187 .",
    "thus , the lower limit on the mass accretion rate or luminosity leading to the formation of an inner disk is set by the conduction model , which is found to depend on the viscosity parameter . for a @xmath188 black hole ,",
    "condensation could occur at an accretion rate as low as @xmath184 for a standard viscosity parameter @xmath59 .",
    "however , if observations suggest high - temperature soft component ( say , @xmath189kev ) , compton scattering must play a role in cooling of the corona , and the lower limit to the accretion rate is higher , corresponding to about 0.01@xmath190 , depending on the viscosity .",
    "hence , our considerations of the two cooling regimes suggest cool inner disks may be present for systems with x - ray luminosities as low as 0.001 - 0.01 @xmath5 .",
    "this is of particular interest for j1753.5 - 0127 since it remained in a hard state throughout its outburst , suggesting that a spectral transition from a hard state to a soft state during an outburst is not a necessary condition for the formation of an inner disk in the hard state .",
    "observations of j1753.5 - 0127 at even lower luminosity levels would be especially valuable in constraining the model parameters further . of particular interest , we note that the observations of different classes of systems suggest that the viscosity parameter is relatively high ( @xmath191 , see king et al . 2007 ; exceeding more than 0.5 from mhd simulation by sharma et al . 2006 ) , overlapping with the range of values inferred from our modeling .",
    "an upper bound on the luminosity for which an inner disk exists in the hard state can also be estimated .",
    "the luminosity given by the condensation model increases with increasing accretion rate and decreasing viscosity .",
    "thus , the upper bound is constrained by the highest accretion rate and lowest viscosity .",
    "for example , at a transition accretion rate of 0.02 ( 0.0675 ) , the upper bound to the luminosity is 0.003 ( 0.009 ) for @xmath192 .",
    "we point out that at the upper limit of @xmath193 suggested by narayan et al .",
    "( 1995b ) for the existence of an adaf , the lowest viscosity is 0.342 . a lower value for @xmath10 would correspond to a transition rate lower than 0.1 ( from @xmath153 ) , and the system would no longer lie in the low / hard state .",
    "hence , in this limit , an upper bound on the luminosity is 0.02 for this transition accretion rate .",
    "this is in good agreement with a hard - to - soft transition luminosity of 1%-4% found in x - ray binaries ( maccarone 2003 ) .",
    "it has been shown in previous investigations of the energy and mass exchange between the accretion disk and its corona that the results of both the evaporation process , i.e. , the eddington scaled evaporation rate ( @xmath194 ) and its distribution with respect to the scaled distance ( @xmath195 ) and the condensation process to a truncated inner cool disk are not dependent on the mass of the black hole ( liu et al .",
    "2002 ; liu et al .",
    "2006 ; meyer et al . 2007 ;",
    "see also eqs.[r_cnd1 ] and [ condensation_cnd ] ) . by including the effect of compton cooling in the present study",
    ", the condensation rate appears to depend on the mass of the black hole and the disk effective temperature , as shown in eqs.[r_cnd2 ] and [ condensation - cmp ] .",
    "if the accretion of the condensing matter is the only energy source for establishing the thermal properties of the disk , the effective temperature is no longer a free parameter , but is determined by eq.[t_eff ] .",
    "replacing @xmath196 in eqs .",
    "[ r_cnd2 ] , [ a ] , and [ b ] by eq.[t_eff ] , we find that the critical radius where condensation takes place , @xmath57 , and the quantities @xmath197 and @xmath198 only depend on the disk viscosity parameter and the mass accretion rate as given by          with above expression for @xmath57 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 we obtain from eq.[condensation - cmp ] a non - linear equation describing the condensation rate @xmath202 , which depends on @xmath10 and the eddington scaled accretion rate @xmath12 , but independent of @xmath11 .",
    "for any given accretion rate and viscosity parameter , the condensation rate is determined by eq.[condensation - cmp ] .",
    "likewise , the extent of the compton cooling dominant region , the electron temperature in the corona , and the compton luminosity are determined as @xmath203^{-2/3}\\le 846.71\\dot m_{\\rm cnd}^{2/3},\\ ] ] @xmath204^{-2/5},\\ ] ] @xmath205 thus the condensation process and the thermal state of the corona ( i.e. , the electron temperature ) are independent on the mass of the black hole . taking into account the mass - independent features of the previously developed model and its extension in this study , we conclude that the simple description of the accretion process within the framework of an evaporation / condensation picture can be applied not only to stellar mass black holes in x - ray binary systems , but also to supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei .",
    "the presence of a cool disk in the innermost regions surrounding a supermassive black hole in a low state would directly contribute to the ultraviolet and optical emission and possibly indirectly via reflected x - ray emission from a spatially extended inner disk .",
    "in addition , it would provide a natural site of cool material where neutral iron could be present for the production of fe fluorescent line emission at 6.4 kev ( e.g. tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ) . a more detailed study of the properties of such a cool disk would be especially illuminating for interpretations of fe line profiles based on general relativistic broadening , though at present it is difficult to observe such a line spectrum from low luminosity active galactic nuclei .",

    "<S> the condensation of matter from a corona to a cool , optically thick inner disk is investigated for black hole x - ray transient systems in the low hard state . </S>",
    "<S> a description of a simple model for the exchange of energy and mass between corona and disk originating from thermal conduction is presented , taking into account the effect of compton cooling of the corona by photons from the underlying disk . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a weak , condensation - fed inner disk can be present in the low hard state of black hole transient systems for a range of luminosities which depend on the magnitude of the viscosity parameter . for @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> an inner disk can exist for luminosities in the range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model is applied to the x - ray observations of the black hole candidate sources gx 339 - 4 and swift j1753.5 - 0127 in their low hard state . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that compton cooling is important in the condensation process , leading to the maintenance of cool inner disks in both systems . </S>",
    "<S> as the results of the evaporation / condensation model are independent of the black hole mass , it is suggested that such inner cool disks may contribute to the optical and ultraviolet emission of low luminosity active galactic nuclei . </S>"
