    "in this paper we study a queueing network served by a single shared server , that visits the queues in a cyclic order .",
    "each queue receives gated service .",
    "customers from the outside arrive at the queues according to independent poisson processes , and the service time and switch - over time distributions are general . after receiving service at queue @xmath0 ,",
    "a customer is either routed to queue @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 , or leaves the system with probability @xmath3 .",
    "this model can be seen as an extension of the standard polling model by customer routing , introduced and analyzed by sidi et al . @xcite .",
    "the possibility of re - routing of customers further enhances the already - extensive modeling capabilities of polling models , which find applications in diverse areas such as computer systems , communication networks , logistics , flexible manufacturing systems , robotics systems , production systems and maintenance systems ( see , for example , @xcite for overviews ) .",
    "applications of this type of customer routing can be found , for example , in manufacturing when products undergo service in a number of stages or in the context of rework .",
    "the present research can be seen as a unifying analysis for a variety of special cases ( besides polling systems ) , such as tandem queues @xcite , multi - stage queueing models with parallel servers @xcite , feedback vacation queues @xcite and many others .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we study exact heavy - traffic ( ht ) asymptotics of the system under consideration . under ht scalings",
    "we derive a closed - form expression for the joint queue - length vector at polling instants under ht scalings .",
    "this result , in turn , is shown to lead to a closed - form expression for the expected delay at a queue at an arbitrary moment .",
    "this expression is strikingly simple and shows explicitly how the expected delays depend on the system parameters , and in particular , on the routing probabilities @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , we derive a closed - form approximation for the mean delay for arbitrary loads , based on an interpolation between the light - traffic ( lt ) and ht limits .",
    "numerical results are presented to assess the accuracy of this approximation .",
    "we would like to note that the analysis of the present paper can be extended in several directions , for example different server routing policies or service disciplines . for reasons of compactness",
    ", these results are however not discussed .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ modelsection ]",
    "we describe the model in further detail .",
    "this model is analyzed under ht scalings in section [ analysissection ] . in section [ approxsection ]",
    "we develop an approximation based on the lt and ht limits for the mean waiting times and give a numerical example .",
    "in this paper we consider a queueing network consisting of @xmath4 infinite buffer queues @xmath5 .",
    "external customers arrive at @xmath6 according to a poisson arrival process with rate @xmath7 , and have a generally distributed service requirement @xmath8 at @xmath6 , with mean value @xmath9 $ ] , and second moment @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the queues are served by a single server in cyclic order .",
    "whenever the server switches from @xmath6 to @xmath11 , a switch - over time @xmath12 is incurred , with mean @xmath13 .",
    "the cycle time @xmath14 is the time between successive moments when the server arrives at @xmath6 .",
    "the total switch - over time in a cycle is denoted by @xmath15 and its first two moments are @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "indices throughout the paper are modulo @xmath18 , so @xmath19 actually refers to @xmath20 .",
    "all service times and switch - over times are mutually independent .",
    "each queue receives gated service , which means that only those customers present at the server s arrival at @xmath6 will be served before the server switches to the next queue .",
    "this queueing network can be modeled as a _ polling system _ with the specific feature that it allows for routing of the customers : upon completion of service at @xmath6 , a customer is either routed to @xmath21 with probability @xmath2 , or leaves the system with probability @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath22 for all @xmath0 , and that the transition of a customer from @xmath6 to @xmath21 takes no time .",
    "the model under consideration has a branching structure , which is discussed in more detail by resing @xcite .",
    "the total arrival rate at @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath23 , which is the unique solution of the following set of linear equations : @xmath24 the offered load to @xmath6 is @xmath25 and the total utilisation is @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the system is stable , which means that @xmath27 should be less than one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the total service time of a customer is the total amount of service given during the presence of the customer in the network , denoted by @xmath28 , and its first two moments by @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the first two moments are uniquely determined by the following set of linear equations : for @xmath31 , @xmath32    for each variable @xmath33 ( which may be a scalar , a vector or a matrix ) that is a function of @xmath27 , we denote its value _ evaluated at _ @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "also , we will be taking ht limits , letting @xmath36 . to be precise",
    ", the limit is taken such that the arrival rates @xmath37 are increased , while keeping the service and switch - over time distributions , the routing probabilities and the _ ratios _ between these arrival rates fixed .",
    "also , an @xmath18-dimensional vector @xmath38 has components @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the @xmath18-dimensional vector that describes the joint queue length at a visit beginning at @xmath20 .",
    "sidi et al .",
    "@xcite show that the joint queue - length process at successive visit beginnings to @xmath20 constitutes an @xmath18-dimensional multi - type branching process ( mtbp ) with immigration in each state . in this section",
    "we focus on the limiting behavior of @xmath41 as @xmath27 goes to 1 .",
    "the joint queue - length vector at polling instants at @xmath20 has the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath42 with @xmath43/\\sum_{j=1}^n\\lambda_j,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath44 is a gamma - distributed random variable with shape parameter @xmath45 and scale parameter 1 .    for reasons of compactness",
    "we omit the proof , noting that the basis for the proof is given by the general framework as proposed in @xcite .",
    "next , we focus on the workload in the individual queues . to this end",
    ", we note that simple balancing arguments can be used to show that @xmath46=r/(1-\\rho)$ ] , which does not depend on @xmath0 . to obtain ht - results for the amount of work in each queue",
    ", we use the heavy traffic averaging principle ( htap ) for polling systems @xcite .",
    "when the system becomes saturated , two limiting processes take place .",
    "the scaled total workload tends to a bessel - type diffusion whereas the work in each queue is changing at a much faster rate than the total workload .",
    "this implies that during the course of a cycle , the total workload can be considered as constant , while the workloads of the individual queues fluctuate according to a fluid model .",
    "the htap relates these two limiting processes .",
    "the fluid limit of the per - queue workload is obtained by dividing by @xmath47 and letting @xmath36 . for our model , the fluid model for the workload at @xmath6",
    "is a piecewise linear function .",
    "more precisely , it is easy to show that the fluid limit of the mean amount of work at @xmath6 at the beginning of a visit to @xmath21 is @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , in the fluid limit the probability that at an arbitrary moment the server is visiting @xmath21 is @xmath52 . combining these observations",
    ", one can obtain the following expression for @xmath53 , defined as the fluid limit of the average amount of work at @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath31 , @xmath54    note that in the classical case where @xmath55 for all @xmath56 we have @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , it is easily verified that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is defined in .",
    "subsequently , the diffusion limit of the _ total _ workload process and the workload in the individual queues can be related using the htap . to this end",
    ", we start with the cycle - time distribution under ht scalings .",
    "[ lemmacycletime ] for @xmath31 , @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath14 no longer depends on @xmath0 in the ht limit .",
    "the proof can be found along the same lines as in @xcite .",
    "lemma  [ lemmacycletime ] implies that the ht limit of the _ mean _ ( scaled ) amount of work found by an arbitrary customer is @xmath63 $ ] , where @xmath64 is the _ length - biased _ cycle time , with limiting distribution @xmath65 .",
    "again , see @xcite for more details",
    ".    the ( ht limit of the ) mean waiting time of an arbitrary customer in @xmath6 can be found by application of little s law to the mean queue length at @xmath6 , which is simply the mean amount of work in @xmath6 divided by the mean total service time .    for @xmath31 , @xmath66 \\rightarrow \\left(r+\\frac{{\\tilde{b}}^{(2)}}{2\\delta{\\tilde{b}}^{(1)}}\\right)\\frac{\\delta_i}{{\\tilde{b}}_i\\hat\\gamma_i } , \\qquad ( \\rho\\uparrow1 ) .",
    "\\label{ewht}\\ ] ]    equation reveals a variety of properties about the dependence of the limiting mean delay with respect to the system parameters .",
    "the mean waiting times @xmath67 $ ] are independent of the visit order of the server , depend on the switch - over time distributions only through @xmath68 , and depend on the service - time distributions only through @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the lt limit of @xmath67 $ ] can be found by conditioning on the customer type ( external or internally routed ) .      in light traffic",
    "we ignore all @xmath72 terms , which implies that we can consider a customer as being alone in the system .",
    "equation can be interpreted as follows .",
    "an arbitrary customer in @xmath6 has arrived from outside the network with probability @xmath73 . in this case",
    "he has to wait for a residual total switchover time with mean @xmath74 .",
    "if a customer in @xmath6 arrives after being served in another queue , say @xmath21 ( with probability @xmath75 ) , he has to wait for the mean switch - over times @xmath76 .",
    "subsequently , we construct an interpolation between the lt and ht limits that can be used as an approximation for the mean waiting times . for @xmath31 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the lt and ht limits respectively , as given in and .",
    "because of the way @xmath80 is constructed , it has the nice properties that it is exact as @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , it satisfies a so - called pseudo - conservation law for the mean waiting times , which is derived in @xcite .",
    "this implies that the @xmath80 yields exact results for symmetric ( and , hence , single - queue ) systems .",
    "we do not aim at giving an extensive numerical study to assess the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "instead , we give one numerical example that indicates the versatility of the model that we have discussed , and shows the practical usage of the approximation . to this end , we use an example that was introduced by katayama @xcite , who studies a network consisting of three queues .",
    "customers arrive at @xmath20 and @xmath83 , and are routed to @xmath84 after being served .",
    "this model , which is referred to as a tandem queueing model with parallel queues in the first stage , is a special case of the model discussed in the present paper .",
    "we simply put @xmath85 and all other @xmath2 are zero .",
    "we use the same values as in @xcite : @xmath86 , service times are deterministic with @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the server visits the queues in cyclic order : 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 ,  .",
    "the only difference with the model discussed in @xcite is that we introduce ( deterministic ) switch - over times @xmath89 .",
    "we assume that no time is required to switch between the two queues in the first stage , so @xmath90 . in table",
    "[ numericalresults ] we show the mean waiting times of customers at the three queues and their approximated values . from this table",
    "we can see that the accuracy is best for values of @xmath27 close to 0 or 1 , but the overall accuracy is very good in general .",
