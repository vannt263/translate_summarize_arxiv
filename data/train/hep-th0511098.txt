    "one of the main problems in physics now is to know the nature of the dark matter and the understanding of the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "these two phenomena have been observed in the last years and now there are a number of observations supporting the existence of the dark matter @xcite and the accelerated expansion of the universe as well @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "one of the main problems of superstring theory is that there is not a real phenomenology which can support the theory .",
    "usually , superstring theory is supported only by its mathematical and internal consistency , but not by real experiments or observations . for some people , like the authors , one way of how superstring theory can make contact with phenomenology is through the cosmology @xcite . in the last years , a number of new observations have given rise to a new cosmology and to a new perception of the universe ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "in superstring theory there are 6 extra dimensions forming a compact internal calabi - yau manifold @xcite .",
    "size and shape of this manifold manifests , at the four dimensional low energy effective field theory , a series of scalar fields ( moduli of the theory ) many of which apparently have not been seen in nature . in particular , two fields , the _ dilaton _ and the _ axion _ , are two very important components of the theory which can not be easily fixed .",
    "in fact , one should find a physical interpretation for these fields or give an explanation of why we are not able to see them in nature .",
    "one interpretation is that there exist a mechanism for eliminating these fields during the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "recently , one of the most popular interpretations for the dilaton field is that it can be the dark energy of the universe , @xmath1 a quintessence field @xcite .",
    "these last interpretations have been possible because after a non trivial compactification , the dilaton field acquires an effective potential .",
    "this effective potential makes possible to compare the dilaton field with some other kinds of matter @xcite . in this work",
    "we are giving the dilaton a _",
    "different _ interpretation supposing that it is the dark matter instead of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "such attempts have been carried over in the past with other dilaton potentials @xcite . here",
    ", we will be very specific starting with an effective potential derived recently from the type iib supergravity theory .",
    "the main goal of this work is to show that this interpretation could be closer to a realistic cosmology as the interpretation that the dilaton is the dark energy .",
    "we will see that the late cosmology is very similar to the @xmath0cdm one with this alternative interpretation .",
    "nevertheless , we will also see that it is necessary to do something else in order to recover a realistic cosmology from superstring theory . on the other hand ,",
    "a great deal of work has been done recently , in the context of string compactifications with three - form fluxes ( r - r and ns - ns ) on the internal six - dimensional space and the exploration on their consequences in the stabilization of the moduli fields including the dilaton @xmath2 and axion @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "moduli stabilization has been used also in string cosmology to fix other moduli fields than the volume modulus including dilaton+axion and kahler moduli @xcite . for a description of more realistic scenarios ,",
    "see @xcite .    in the context of the type iib supergravity theory on the @xmath4 orientifold with a self - dual three - form fluxes",
    ", it has been shown that after compactifaying the effective dilaton - axion potential is given by @xcite v_dil&= & h^2e^-2_i_i , [ eq : poteff ] where @xmath5 .",
    "here @xmath6 are the ns - ns integral fluxes , the superscript @xmath7 in the fields stands for the fields in the vacuum configuration and finally @xmath8 with @xmath9 are the overall size of each factor @xmath10 of the @xmath4 orientifold ( in @xcite there is a mistprint in the potential [ eq : poteff ] ) . here",
    "we will simplify the system supposing that the moduli fields @xmath8 are constant for the late universe .    for the sake of simplicity in the derivation of the potential ( [ eq : poteff ] )",
    ", some assumptions were made @xcite .",
    "one of them is the assumption that the tensions of d - branes and orientifold planes cancel with the energy @xmath11 at @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "an assumption on initial conditions is that the dilaton is taken to deviate from equilibrium value , while the complex structure moduli are not .",
    "it is also assumed that ( [ eq : poteff ] ) has a global minimum @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 . also that , the complex moduli are fixed and only the radial modulus @xmath16 feels a potential when the dilaton - axion system is excited .",
    "these assumptions make the model more simple , but still with the sufficient structure to be of interest in cosmological and astrophysical problems .    in order to study the cosmology of this model , it is convenient to define the following quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the string coupling @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the reduced plank mass @xmath24 . with this new variables ,",
    "the dilaton potential transforms into v_dil&= & v_0 ( ( ) -1)+v_0e^ _ 0 ^ 2 ^ 2 + & = & v_+e^ v_. [ eq : v ] in some works the scalar field potential ( [ eq : v ] ) is suggested to be the dark energy of the universe , that means , a quintessence field @xcite@xcite . in this work we are not following this interpretation to the dilaton field . instead of this",
    ", we will interpret the term @xmath25 as the dark matter of the universe@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the remaining term in @xmath11 contains the contribution of the axion field @xmath3 .",
    "this is what makes the difference between our work and previous ones .",
    "this interpretation allows us to compare the cosmology derived from the potential ( [ eq : v ] ) with the @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model .",
    "the rest of the fields coming from superstrings theory can be modeled as usual , assuming that this part of the matter is a perfect fluid .",
    "this perfect fluid has two epochs : radiation and matter dominated ones . in order to consider both epochs we write the matter component as matter and radiation , with a state equation given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for modelling the dark energy we can take the most general form supposing that it is also a perfect fluid with the equation of state given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is smaller than 1/3 and can even be negative in the case it represents a phantom energy @xcite field .",
    "it is just zero if @xmath30 represents the cosmological constant @xmath31 .",
    "now , we proceed to describe the different epochs of the universe using this new interpretation .",
    "we can easily distinguish two behaviors of the scalar field potential : the exponential and the power laws . in the early universe the exponential behavior dominates the scalar fields potential . in this case",
    "we have the following analysis .    _",
    "inflation.- _ in this epoch , the scalar field potential can be written as @xmath32 because the exponential dominates completely the scenario of the evolution of the dilaton potential .",
    "the distinctive feature during this period is that the presence of the fluxes generate a quadratic term in the friedman equation .",
    "the scalar field density @xmath33 appears quadratic in the field equations , h^2=(1 + ) . under this conditions",
    "it is known that these potentials are always inflationary in the presence of these fluxes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , exponential potentials are inflationary without branes , in the traditional friedman cosmology , only if @xmath34 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , if we suppose that @xmath35 , the dilaton potential ( [ eq : v ] ) is not inflationary without the quadratic density term .",
    "thus , as the universe inflates , the quadratic term becomes much more smaller than the linear term and we recover the friedman equation @xmath36 , where the exponential potential is not inflationary anymore .",
    "for these values of @xmath21 this gives a natural graceful - exit to this scalar field potential @xcite .",
    "it remains to study which is the influence of the axion potential to this epoch @xcite .",
    "evolution.- _ the evolution of the densities is quite sensible to the initial conditions .",
    "let us study the example of evolution shown in fig.[fig : completo1 ] .",
    "as in the @xmath0cdm model , here also the recombination period starts around the redshift @xmath37 .",
    "the first difference we find between @xmath0cdm model and the iib superstrings theory is just between the redshifts @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where the interaction between the dilaton and matter gives rise to oscillations of the densities .",
    "it is just in this epoch where we have to look for observations that can distinguish between these two models . in this epoch",
    "the scalar field is already small @xmath39 and approaches the minimum of the potential in @xmath40 .",
    "thus , potential ( [ eq : v ] ) starts to behave as a power low potential , simulating a type @xmath41 field .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that this potential mimics very well the dark matter behavior . in the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "dark matter is modeled as dust and it is well known that power low potentials mimics dust fluids as they oscillate around the minimum of the potential @xcite . in figures fig.[fig : completo1 ] and fig.[fig : completo2 ] this behavior is confirmed .",
    "nevertheless , for redshifts bigger than @xmath42 , there are remarkable differences between the superstring model and the cdm one .",
    "the interaction of the dilaton field with matter provokes to be very difficult that radiation dominates the universe , thus big bang nucleosynthesis never takes place , at lest in a similar way as in the cdm paradigm .",
    "let us explain this point .",
    "the dilaton field interacts with matter through the factor @xmath43 , being @xmath44 the field strength of the matter contents .",
    "thus , lagrangian for the superstrings system is @xmath45 where we have differentiated the scalar field potential coupling constant @xmath21 from the axion - dilaton coupling constant @xmath46 in order to generalized and clarify the cosmology of the system .",
    "in ( [ eq : poteff ] ) both are the same @xmath47 .",
    "the individual lagrangians for the dilaton and axion fields respectively are ,    @xmath48    thus , in a flat friedman - robertson - walker space - time the cosmological field equations are given by @xmath49 where the dot stands for the derivative with respect to the cosmological time and @xmath50 is the hubble parameter @xmath51 . in order to analyze the behavior of this cosmology",

    "@xmath73 the system contains many critical points , some of them are atractors with dark matter dominance , other with dark energy dominance .",
    "@xmath74 the system depends strongly on the initial conditions .",
    "one example of the evolution of the densities is plotted in fig.[fig : completo1 ] and fig.[fig : completo2 ] , where we show that the densities behave in a very similar way as the corresponding ones of the @xmath0cdm model before redshifts @xmath38 , which seem to be a generic behavior .",
    "the free constants @xmath21 , @xmath75 and @xmath46 are given in each figure .",
    "on the other side , we can see that after redshifts @xmath76 one finds that @xmath77 and oscillating goes to zero , such that its exponential is bounded @xmath78 see fig .",

    "the scalar field starts from big values and riches very fast its minimum where it starts to oscillate .",
    "we plot @xmath80 , for @xmath81.,width=340 ]    however , there is one fact that takes our attention in fig[fig : completo1 ] .",
    "we see from the behavior of the densities on the early universe after redshifts @xmath82 , that radiation does not dominates the rest of the densities as it is required for big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "this fact can also be seen as follows . in a radiation dominated universe",
    "we might set @xmath83 , in that case we can see by inspection of ( [ eq : x])-([eq : w ] ) that there is no way that radiation remains as a dominant component of the system .",
    "the situations radically change if we put @xmath84 in system ( [ eq : x])-([eq : w ] ) , in this case radiation has no problems to be dominant somewhere . in order to show how the dilaton and axion interaction with matter work , we study the particular case @xmath84 and let us artificially drop out the matter interaction from the dilaton equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) . in what follows",
    "we study this toy model .",
    "for this one it is convenient to change the variable @xmath68 for @xmath85 , with the definition of the potentials @xmath86 such that @xmath87 .",
    "thus , equations ( [ eq : x])-([eq : w ] ) transform into the new system @xmath88 the quantity @xmath59 is now defined as @xmath89 and the new friedman constriction ( [ eq : friedman ] ) reads x^2+a^2+y^2+z^2+u^2+l^2+(u+v)^2w^2=1 .",
    "[ eq : constriccion_old ] the density quantities @xmath90 now are @xmath91 where we have used the constriction ( [ eq : constriccion_old ] )",
    ". equations ( [ eq : w_old ] ) are now a new dynamical system .",
    "the evolution of this one is shown in fig[fig : pegado ] .",
    "from here we can see that now radiation dominates the early universe without problems and that the behavior of the densities is again very similar to the @xmath0cdm model but now for all redshifts .",
    "the only difference is at redshifts @xmath92 , where the densities oscillate very hard .",
    "unfortunately this time corresponds to the dark age , when the universe has no stars and there is nothing to observe which could give us some observational clue for this behavior .",
    "finally , if the set both coupling constant @xmath93 , we recover a very similar behavior of the densities to the @xmath0cdm model , this behavior es shown in fig.[fig : cosh ] .",
    "observe here that the densities have not oscillations any more , as in the @xmath0cdm model , supporting the idea that it is just the coupling between dilaton , axion and matter which makes difficult that the string theory reproduces the observed universe .",
    "plot of the dynamics of the @xmath65 s in the type iib superstring theory with fluxes .",
    "observe how this theory predicts a similar behavior of the matter content of the universe as the @xmath0cdm model , even for redshifts beyond @xmath94 . here",
    "radiation dominates the universe for values less than @xmath95 and big bang nucleosynthesis takes place as in the cdm model .",

    "all the coupling constants of the superstrings model @xmath93 , @xmath99 , the initial values of the dynamical variables at redshift @xmath66 are the same as in fig[fig : completo1 ] . observe how this theory predicts an extremely similar behavior of the matter content of the universe as the @xmath0cdm model , for all redshifts .",
    "each curve contains over @xmath100 points.,width=340 ]    _ structure formation.- _ as shown in figures fig.[fig : completo1 ] and fig.[fig : pegado ] the axion field can be completely subdominant , but it can dominates the universe at early times as in fig.[fig : completo2 ] . at late times ,",
    "@xmath101 , the structure formation is determined by the dilaton field @xmath79 and its effective potential ( [ eq : v ] ) . in @xcite it was shown that the scalar field fluctuations with a cosh potential follow the corresponding ones of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model for the linear regime .",
    "there , it is shown that the field equations of the scalar field fluctuations can be written in terms of the ones of the @xmath0cdm model , in such a way that both models predict the same spectrum in the linear regime of fluctuations .    _ galaxies formation.- _ other main difference between both models , the cdm and type iib superstrings is just in the non - linear regime of fluctuations . here",
    "numerical simulations show that the scalar field virialize very early @xcite , causing that in the superstring model galaxies form earlier than in the cdm paradigm .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the scalar field does not have a cuspy central density profile @xcite .",
    "numerical and semi - analytic simulations have shown that the density profiles of oscillations ( collapsed scalar fields ) are almost flat in the center @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it has been also possible to compare high and low surface brightness galaxies with the scalar field model and the comparison shows that there is a concordance between the model and the observations , provided that the values of the parameters are just @xmath102 , @xmath103 @xcite . with this values of @xmath104 and @xmath21 , the critical mass for collapse of the scalar field is just @xmath105 @xcite , as it is expected for the halos of galaxies .",
    "these two features of the scalar field collapse might give distinctive features to superstring theory .",
    "at the present time there is a controversy about the density profiles of the dark matter in the centers of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "this model of the superstring theory predicts that the center of the galaxies contains an almost flat central density profile .",
    "we are aware that this result corresponds to the particular compactification @xmath106 , but it could be a general signature of string theory , in the sense that it could survive in a more realistic compactification ( including branes and fluxes ) , that give rise to models that resemble the standard model . in this case , if the cuspy dark matter density profiles are observed or explained in some way , this model would be ruled out .",
    "but if these profiles are not observed , it would be an important astrophysical signature of string theory .",
    "in this work we propose an alternative interpretation of the dilaton field in the type iib supergravity on the @xmath4 orientifold model with fluxes @xcite .",
    "this alternative interpretation allowed us to compare this model with the @xmath0cdm one , which has been very successful in its predictions .",
    "the result is that , at lest in this model , radiation seems to be subdominant everywhere , provoking difficulties to explain big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "even when we see that in this particular toy model , the behavior seems to be generic for all strings theories . if this is the case , it is possible that the dilaton and axion fields could not be able to be interpreted as dark matter or dark energy , thus ether we should seek other candidates and explain why we do nt see the dilaton and axion scalar fields in our observations , or we have to explain big bang nucleosynthesis using the conditions given by superstrigs theory we showed here , or we have to look for a mechanism to eliminate the coupling between dilaton and axion with matter at very early times .",
    "this last option is maybe more realistic .",
    "even if we solve the radiation dominance problem , there are some differences between @xmath0cdm and superstrings theory between @xmath92 , because string theory predicts around 16 millon years of densities oscillations during the dark age . nevertheless , both models are very similar at late times , between @xmath107 , maybe the only difference during this last period is their predictions on substructure formation and galaxies centers .",
    "while cdm predicts much more substructure in the universe and very sharp density profiles , scalar fields predict few substructure and almost constant density profiles in centers of galaxies .",
    "the confirmation of this observations could decide between these two models .",
    "we are aware that this is orientifold model is still a toy model and it would be interesting to study more realistic compactifications ( including brane and orientifold configurations ) and see if our results , including that of the dark matter density profiles , survive and become a general feature of string theory . if this is the case , this alternative interpretation of the fields of the theory might permit to establish a contact of string theory with the astrophysics phenomenology of dark matter , @xmath1 , its a contact with future astrophysical and cosmological observations .",
    "we conclude that this interpretation can give us a closer understanding of superstrings theory with cosmology .    ",
