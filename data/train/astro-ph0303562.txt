    "over the past decade there has been a dramatic confirmation of the basic paradigm in which agn are energized by the accretion of matter onto massive black holes ( mbhs ) .",
    "massive black holes ( mbhs ) detected in the centers of many nearby non - active galaxies ( kormendy and richstone 1995 , kormendy & gebhardt ( 2002 ) ) show an approximately linear relation with the luminosity of the host bulge , inferring the black hole mass is 0.001 - 0.002 of the bulge .",
    "in addition to the mbhs detected by techniques of stellar and gas kinematics , the masses of about three dozen mbhs in agns have been estimated by reverberation mapping of the broad emission - line region .",
    "high quality reverberation data and virial bh mass estimates are presently available for 20 seyfert 1 nuclei ( wandel , peterson and malkan 1999 , hereafter wpm ) and 17 pg quasars ( kaspi 2000 ) . the virial estimate has been shown to be consistent with the real bh mass ( peterson & wandel 1999 ; 2000 ) .",
    "previous work suggested that mbhs of active galactic nuclei ( seyfert galaxies and quasars ) follow a similar relation ( laor 1998 ; ho 1999 ; wandel 1999 ) .",
    "new and updated data for agn confirm that agn and quiescent galaxies have the same bh - bulge mass relation ( wandel 2002 ; mclure & dunlop 2003 ) .",
    "a strong and tight relation was found between the bh mass and the central stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy : ferrarese and merritt ( 2000 ) and gebhardt ( 2000a ) have found that mbhs of inactive galaxies is better correlated with the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge than with the bulge luminosity .",
    "apparently this relation holds also for agns : the few seyfert galaxies with stellar velocity data and reverberation bh mass estimates seem to be consistent with the bh - velocity dispersion relation of inactive galaxies ( gebhardt 2000b ) , a conclusion strengthened by recent observations of the velocity dispersion in mapped seyfert galaxies ( ferrarese 2001 ) .",
    "we combine new and updated data to yield a data base of 55 agns ( 28 quasars , 18 seyfert 1 galaxies and 9 narrow line agns ) .",
    "most of these objects have mapping masses and almost all of them have the bulge luminosity measured directly by using bulge / disk decomposition ( mclure & dunlop 2000 ) . our results ( figure [ fig1 ] ) indicate that broad - line agns ( wandel 2002 ) follow the same bh - bulge relation as ordinary ( inactive ) galaxies ( kormendy and gebhardt 2002 ) , while narrow line agns have significantly lower bh / bulge mass ratios .",
    "we find that broad line agns have an average black hole / bulge mass fraction of @xmath0 with a strong correlation ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this bh - bulge relation is consistent with the bh - bulge relation of quiescent galaxies and tighter than previous results .",
    "we define narrow line agns as having relatively narrow fwhm regardless of their other properties ( e.g. x - ray spectra ) .",
    "however , the limit between narrow and broad line objects is somewhat arbitrary , and as we show below , the results do not really depend on where one places the border line . also , some of the narrow line objects may have a poorly resolved broad component , hence not being intrinsically narrow .",
    "narrow line agns ( narrow line seyfert 1s and quasars , defined here as agns having permitted lines narrower than 2200km / s ) appear to have a lower bh / bulge ratio , @xmath2 .",
    "a similar suggestion was made by mathur et al ( 2001 ) on the basis of bh masses estimated mainly from accretion disk fitting .",
    "it is not obvious that the lower bh / bulge ratio of narrow line agns reflects also in the @xmath3 relation : the few narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies with measured stellar velocity dispersion seem to be consistent with @xmath3 ratio as broad line agns and quiescent galaxies .",
    "we use the faber - jackson relation to predict the velocity dispersion of agns and combine it with the measured bh masses to give the @xmath3 relation for over 50 agns",
    ".      the lower bh / bulge ratios of narrow - line agn seems to be part of a continous trend : we find that the @xmath4 ratio in agn is strongly correlated with the emission - line width , @xmath5        this tight correlation is not surprising - it is probably reflecting the virial relation @xmath6 . combining the two relations and cancelling out the dependence on the line width ( velocity ) on both sides of the equation we find a new , independent relation : @xmath7    a very tight correlation between bulge luminosity and blr size ( fig.[fig2 ] ) the best fit to all 55 agns in our sample is @xmath8 with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 .",
    "this is a non trivial correlation , as it relates two independent observables : on the one hand the bulge luminosity , a global galactic property on a scale of kpc , and on the other hand the distance of the line - emitting ionized gas from the central continuum source - the broad line region ( blr ) size measured by reverberation mapping - on a scale of few light days .",
    "the correlation may be caused by the blr radius scaling with the agn luminosity via the eddington ratio , but it is much stronger than the bh - bulge relation which supports the possibility of this new relation being more fundamental .",
    "interestingly , narrow line agns are not different from broad line agns in this new relation .",
    "we find that in agns with `` narrow '' boad lines ( e.g. h@xmath9 ) the /bulge ratio seems to be significantly smaller than in broad line agns and in normal galaxies . yet ,",
    "in earlier works seyfert galaxies seem to be consistent with the @xmath10 relation of inactive galaxies ( gebhardt 2000b ; merritt & ferrarese 2001b ) .",
    "the question whether nlans have smaller bh masses can therefore be approached by looking more carefully at their location in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "the bulge velocity dispersion is measured for only 11 seyfert 1 galaxies and one radio galaxy . of these",
    "4 can be classified as having narrow lines ( mrk 110 , mrk 590 , 3c120 and ngc 4051 ) and 8 as broad - line seyferts .    ) .",
    "blue triangles are broad line seyferts , pink squares denote nls1s and red circles denote quasars .",
    "solid symbols dennote seyferts with measured @xmath11 , open ones denote seyferts for which @xmath11 has been estimated from the faber - jackson relation ( see text ) .",
    "the dashed and solid lines show the @xmath12 relation of galaxies ( gebhardt 2000a and ferrarese & merritt 2000 , respectively ) . , width=548,height=340 ]    in figure [ fig3 ] the bh mass is plotted against the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we see that broad line agns are consistent with the @xmath13 relation of inactive galaxies ( @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ; gebhardt ( 2000a ) find @xmath163.65 and merritt and ferrarese ( 2001a ) give 4.72 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous results of smaller agn samples ( gebhardt 2000b , merritt & ferrarese 2001b ) .",
    "we can now determine whether narrow line agns follow the same @xmath13 relation ( which would be in odds to their lower @xmath17 ratios ) or they lie below the broad line agns in the @xmath13 relation as well .",
    "if we look carefully at the locations of the nls1s in figure [ fig3 ] ( modifiied version of fig 7 in wandel 2002 ) we see that out of the four narrow line seyfert 1s with measured @xmath11 denoted by solid pink squares in figure [ fig3 ] ) , three ( mrk 590 , 3c120 and ngc 4051 ) do have lower mbh than the @xmath13 relation of quiescent galaxies and broad line seyferts .",
    "these nls1s ( and particularely 4th , mrk 110 ) have larger bulge luminosity than the average `` @xmath18 relation '' defined as the best linear to all the seyfert galaxies with measured bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion ( fig . 6 of wandel 2002 ) . therefore , part of the reason for the smaller @xmath19 ratios of nlans could be their relatively larger bulges .      for agns without a direct velocity dispersion measurement the relation between the narrow line width and the velocity dispersion ( nelson 2000 ) may be used to estimate the velocity dispersion in the bulge .",
    "interestingly , a tight linear relation seems to exist between the virial mass derived from the doppler width and the ionization parameter of the narrow [ oiii ] line and the bh mass in seyfert galaxies ( wandel and mushotzky 1986 ) .",
    "here we use the faber - jackson ( f - j ) relation to estimate the velocity dispersion of other agn with measured or estimated bulge luminosity .",
    "this is useful to locate those agns ( mainly quasars ) which do not have a measured stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "although the f - j estimates of the velocity dispersion are less certain since the f - j relation has a large scatter , it is encouraging that they lie reasonably well within the same relation as the measured agns .",
    "the standard f - j relation is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a luminosity coefficient determined by a linear fit with a slope of 4 to the observed seyfert galaxies with measured stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "using this relation one may enlarge the sample and increase the dynamical range by including also quasars , for a better estimate of the @xmath10 relation for agn .",
    "we note that the nls1s with measured @xmath11 have a significantly larger luminosity coefficient than broad line ones ( fig 6 of wandel 2002 ) : while for broad line seyfert 1 galaxies @xmath23 , for nls1s galaxies @xmath24 .",
    "we thus use the best linear fit with imposed slope of 4 , @xmath25 .",
    "doing this we see that all narrow line agns added in this manner ( open pink squares in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) have lower bh masses than the value expected from the @xmath10 relation . in wandel ( 2002 )",
    "a different conclusion is obtained because a larger @xmath22 is used for narrow line agns .",
    "we conclude that the lower @xmath26 relation of narrow line agns ( defined here merely by their relatively narrow h@xmath9 lines ) is a result of a lower bh mass ( relatively to the broad line agns ) - which may be reflected also in a lower @xmath27 ratio .",
    "part of the effect may be due to a relatively larger @xmath28 ratio ( relative to broad line seyferts ) .",
    "six out of the eight nlans with estimated @xmath11 from the f - j relation ( open pink squares in fig . [ fig3 ] ) lie below the @xmath13 relation ( smaller bh masses ) .",
    "the lower bh mass of nlans may be intrinsic or apparent , e.g. if the emission lines of nlans seem narrower as a result of inclination , if the blr has a flattened geometry and is viewed nearly face on .",
