    "this warning against instances of inconsistency due to ill - advised nonparametric priors was reiterated in the literature many times over , for example , in cox @xcite and in diaconis and freedman @xcite .",
    "however , general conditions for bayesian consistency were formulated by schwartz as early as 1965  @xcite ; positive results on posterior rates of convergence in the same spirit were obtained in ghosal , ghosh and van der vaart  @xcite ( see also , shen and wasserman  @xcite ) .",
    "the combined message of negative and positive results appears to be that the choice of a nonparametric prior is a sensitive one that leaves room for unintended consequences unless due care is taken .",

    "if @xmath28 is a credible set in @xmath29 ,  ( [ eqassertbvm ] ) guarantees that posterior coverage and coverage under the limiting normal for @xmath28 are ( close to ) equal .",
    "because the limiting normals are _ also _ the asymptotic sampling distributions for efficient point - estimators ,  ( [ eqassertbvm ] ) enables interpretation of credible sets as asymptotically efficient confidence regions . from a practical point of view",

    "first , consider the required existence of a least - favorable submodel in @xmath19 . in many semiparametric problems ,",
    "the efficient score function is _ not _ a proper score in the sense that it corresponds to a smooth submodel ; instead , the efficient score lies in the @xmath143-closure of the set of all proper scores .",

    "it may therefore be hoped that the result remains largely unchanged if we turn  ( [ eqrepara ] ) into a sequence of reparametrizations based on suitably chosen approximately least - favorable submodels .",
    "second , consider the rate @xmath69 , which must be slow enough to satisfy condition ( iv ) and is fixed at ( or above ) the minimax hellinger rate for estimation of the nuisance with known @xmath5 by condition ( ii ) , while satisfying ( i ) and ( iii ) as well . conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) also arise when considering hellinger rates for nonparametric posterior convergence and the methods of ghosal et al .",
    "@xcite can be applied in the present context with minor modifications . in addition",
    ", lemma  [ lemudom ] shows that in a wide class of semiparametric models , condition ( iii ) is satisfied for _ any _ rate sequence @xmath69 .",
    "typically , the numerator in condition ( iv ) is of order @xmath144 , so that condition ( iv ) holds true for any @xmath145 such that @xmath115 .",
    "the above enables a rate - free version of the semiparametric bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem ( corollary  [ corsimplesbvm ] ) , in which conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) above are weakened to become comparable to those of schwartz  @xcite for nonparametric posterior consistency .",
    "applicability of corollary  [ corsimplesbvm ] is demonstrated in section  [ secplr ] , where the linear coefficient in the partial linear regression model is estimated .",
    "third , consider condition ( v ) of theorem  [ thmsbvmone ] : though it is necessary [ as it follows from  ( [ eqconvtv ] ) ] , it is hard to formulate straightforward sufficient conditions to satisfy ( v ) in generality .",
    "moreover , condition ( v ) involves the nuisance prior and , as such , imposes another condition on @xmath146 besides ( i ) . to lessen its influence on  @xmath146 , constructions in section  [ secmarg ] either work for all nuisance priors ( see lemma  [ lemlehmann ] ) or require only consistency of the nuisance posterior ( see theorem  [ thmrocbayes ] ) .",
    "the latter is based on the limiting behavior of posteriors in misspecified parametric models  @xcite and allows for the tentative but general observation that a bias [ cf .",
    "( [ eqnearstraight ] ) ] may ruin @xmath30-consistency of the marginal posterior , especially if the rate @xmath69 is sub - optimal . in the example of section  [ secplr ] ,",
    "the `` hard work '' stems from condition ( v ) of theorem  [ thmsbvmone ] : @xmath147 hlder smoothness and boundedness of the family of regression functions in corollary  [ corsmoothplr ] are imposed in order to satisfy this condition . since conditions ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "appear quite reasonable and conditions ( iii ) and ( iv ) are satisfied relatively easily , condition ( v ) should be viewed as the most complicated in an essential way .",
    "to conclude , consistency under perturbation ( with appropriate rate ) is one of the sufficient conditions , but it is by no means clear in how far it should also hold with necessity .",

    "in particular , it is possible that ( [ eqilan ] ) holds with a less - than - efficient score and fisher information , a result that would have an interpretation analogous to suboptimality in hjek s convolution theorem .",

    "we conclude from the above that besides sufficiency of prior mass , the crucial condition for consistency under perturbation is the existence of a  test sequence @xmath14 satisfying  ( [ eqnuistest ] ) . to find sufficient conditions , we follow a  construction of tests based on the hellinger geometry of the model , generalizing the approach of birg  @xcite and le cam  @xcite to @xmath30-perturbed context .",
    "it is easiest to illustrate their approach by considering the problem of testing / estimating @xmath70 when @xmath5 is known : we cover the nuisance model @xmath169 by a minimal collection of hellinger balls @xmath170 of radii @xmath69 , each of which is convex and hence testable against @xmath31 with power bounded by @xmath171 , based on the minimax theorem  @xcite .",
