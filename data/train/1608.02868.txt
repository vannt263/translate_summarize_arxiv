    "fermi gases in optical lattices offer an interesting alternative where the system parameters can be freely adjusted . in the following",
    "we show that square / brick - wall bilayers can be generated using an extension of the optical lattice setups already used to realize brick - wall @xcite and double - well lattices @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of the experimental implementation that we propose is a laser setup generating an optical lattice potential which alternates between square and brick - wall lattice structures when moving along the @xmath180 direction .",

    "superimposing a standard square lattice potential in the @xmath10 plane @xmath192 results in the desired succession of brick - wall and square planes for @xmath193 and @xmath194 respectively ( where @xmath109 is an integer index ) when choosing adequate values of the single - beam lattice depths .",

    "could be obtained by observing interference peaks in time - of - flight images after sudden release from the optical lattice @xcite . however , attaining the required temperatures in the hubbard regime remains challenging .",
    "the repulsive case is more favorable , and recent experiments have already demonstrated the emergence of short - range magnetic correlations in various dimensionalities ( although long - range magnetic order has not yet been observed ) .",
    "the experiments use either site merging @xcite , bragg scattering @xcite , or high resolution in - situ imaging @xcite to directly measure the singlet fraction , the spin structure factor , and spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "they thus allow for a comprehensive characterization of the magnetic properties of each layer , as well as of the singlet correlations expected between them in the limit of very large interlayer coupling .",

    "the dirac points stemming from the brick - wall layer are shifted both energetically and in @xmath218-space . in an increased brillouin zone , the equivalence between different dirac points is lifted . for strong coupling @xmath219 , dirac points pairwise merge , and a gap",

    "additional dirac points arise from the intersection of brick - wall and square lattice dispersion .",
    "a gap above these dirac points is opened for @xmath220 .",
    "second , we have studied superfluidity of the system in the case of attractive interactions , using a mean - field approach . similar to a single brick - wall layer at half filling , we find a semi - metal to superfluid transition of the bilayer at filling 1/3 or 2/3 . upon increasing the interlayer coupling",
    ", the system undergoes transitions between re - entrant superfluid phases .",
    "third , we have studied the case of strong repulsive interactions , in which the half - filled system is in the mott phase , and can be mapped onto a heisenberg antiferromagnet . using the quantum monte carlo method",
    ", we have studied the behavior upon tuning the interlayer coupling . for @xmath221",
    ", we find a phase transition from magnetic long - range order within the planes to a valence bond crystal with strong dimers between the layers .",
