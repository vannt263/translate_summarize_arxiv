    "galactic - scale winds are important in rapidly star - forming galaxies .",
    "they are the primary mechanism by which energy and metals are ejected from galaxies and deposited into the intergalactic medium , and they are a product of the feedback mechanisms at work in regulating star formation .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been proposed for launching galactic superwinds , including energy and momentum deposition by supernovae ( sn ) , radiation pressure on dust , and cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter cc85 ) developed a one - dimensional ( 1d ) spherically - symmetric model for a very hot wind created by supernova energy injection with two controlling parameters : the thermalization efficiency with which sn energy is converted into thermal energy , and the mass - loading efficiency .",
    "numerical simulations show that this analytic model provides a good approximation in describing the hot wind fluid properties and emission from axisymmetric disk - like configurations ( @xcite ) , or in three - dimensional starburst models ( @xcite ) .    the thermalization efficiency and , in particular , the mass - loading efficiency are the crucial parameters that determine the overall importance of hot winds in driving matter and metals out of galaxies .",
    "higher thermalization efficiencies imply higher velocities and higher temperatures , and larger mass - loading rates imply more hot wind momentum available to accelerate cold clouds . despite their importance",
    "these parameters are difficult to determine observationally . both low ( e.g. , @xcite ) and high thermalization efficiency ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "have been inferred .",
    "constraints on the mass - loss rate of the hot flow ( @xmath0 ) in individual galaxies by observation are few , e.g. , ngc 1569 ( @xcite ) , and m82 ( @xcite ) .    one method to constrain the hot wind properties directly is by x - ray observations .",
    "recently , @xcite constrained the wind parameters in the archetypal nearby starburst galaxy m82 using hard x - ray observations of its central region , finding a high thermalization efficiency ( @xmath8 ) and a mass - loading efficiency of @xmath9 .",
    "however , superwinds in other galaxies with star formation rates ( sfrs ) of @xmath10 yr@xmath6 at both low and high redshift are much less well studied , and a more generic approach needs to be introduced to constrain the hot wind properties and to understand their dynamical importance for rapidly star - forming galaxies .",
    "therefore , we apply the cc85 model across a wide range of galaxies from dwarf starbursts to ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) . by using the observed x - ray properties of galaxies we constrain the thermalization efficiency and mass loading of hot winds",
    ".    star - forming galaxies are luminous x - ray emitters .",
    "in particular , the x - ray luminosities of star - forming galaxies exhibit a tight linear correlation with their sfrs over about four orders of magnitude from @xmath11 yr@xmath6 to @xmath12 yr@xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are the benchmark x - ray tracers that give rise to this linear correlation , but the total x - ray luminosity @xmath13 also has contributions from young sn remnants , neutron stars , the warm / hot ism , and potentially the very hot coronal gas of a cc85-like galactic outflow .",
    "the most recent normalization of the linear correlation between the _ total _ @xmath13 and the sfr is given by @xcite , who find that kev ) and sfr , including ( in unit of erg s@xmath6/@xmath14 yr@xmath15 ) @xmath16 ( @xcite ) , @xmath17 ( @xcite ) , @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , @xmath19 ( @xcite ) and @xmath20 ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath21 where the x - ray emission is from 0.5 kev to 8 kev . among the multiple contributors to the x - ray emission of galaxies , it is the diffuse emission from hot gas that is of special interest here . as we show in section [ model ] , considering only x - rays produced by thermal emission , the cc85 model predicts that the diffuse hard x - ray emission from hot wind gas should scale as @xmath22 at fixed thermalization and mass - loading efficiency .",
    "because the observed correlation is @xmath2 this provides an observational limit on the contribution of hot diffuse x - ray emission , which can then be used to constrain the wind model .    in section [ model ]",
    "we introduce the cc85 model and calculate the hard x - ray emission from the hot wind fluid . in section [ sect_lxsfr ]",
    "the observed @xmath23sfr relation is used to constrain the thermalization and mass - loading efficiency of hot winds . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss whether our results change with different parameters in the model and different forms of the observed @xmath23sfr correlation .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the analytic spherically - symmetric hot flow solution derived by cc85 depends on three parameters : the energy input rate @xmath24 , mass loss rate @xmath0 , and the outflow launch radius @xmath25 which can be de - dimensionalized either by m82 s parameters ( e.g , cc85 model ) or the sfr of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for simplicity ,",
    "two dimensionless parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 are introduced to normalize the energy input and mass - loading efficiency by @xmath28 the cumulative net energy input from sne @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 ergs is the energy injected by an individual sn , sfr@xmath32sfr@xmath33 yr@xmath15 , and @xmath34 is the number of sne per unit mass of star formation , where typically one sn occurs per @xmath35 of stars produced , i.e. , @xmath36 . for a salpeter or chabrier stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus we use @xmath39 to parameterize the energy injection rate . here",
    "@xmath40 could in principle be as high as a few , depending on the imf model , and the contribution to the total heating by stellar winds .",
    "we take @xmath41 in this paper .",
    "equation ( [ parameter1 ] ) is then rewritten as @xmath42    the solution to the cc85 model is given in appendix [ cc85appendix ] .",

    "the diffuse x - ray continuum emission from the hot wind fluid is @xmath68}=\\int n_{e}n_{\\rm h}\\lambda_{\\rm n}^{[\\nu_{1},\\nu_{2}]}(t , z)dv\\ ] ] where @xmath69}(t , z)$ ] is the emissivity at temperature @xmath43 , metallicity @xmath70 , and in the energy band between two ( x - ray ) frequencies @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the hydrogen and electron number density respectively .",
    "standard free - free bremsstrahlung emission dominates the cooling rate @xmath75 for @xmath76 k ( @xmath8 kev ) . a better cooling model should include line emission from ions .",
    "following @xcite , we use the spex package ( version 2.03.03 ) to calculate @xmath75 of a hot plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "cie is a valid assumption if the plasma is dominated by collisional processes and the cooling timescale is longer than the recombination or ionization timescale , otherwise non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) treatments should be taken into account .",
    "@xcite found that it is justified to use cie treatment in m82 , and @xcite discussed that the differences between nei and cie emission are quite small for @xmath77 k. therefore we adopt cie treatment .",
    "figure [ fig_cooling ] shows the @xmath78 kev , @xmath79 kev , @xmath80 kev , and the total cooling functions by integrating over the energy range from 0.1 ev to 1 mev .",
    "solar abundances from @xcite are assumed in this calculation , thus the total cooling function is slightly different from @xcite who adopted solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "the total cooling curve has an order of @xmath81 erg s@xmath6 @xmath82 for @xmath77 k , while the cooling functions at @xmath78 kev and @xmath79 kev reach maximum @xmath83 erg s@xmath6 @xmath82 at @xmath84 k.    the densities @xmath73 can be calculated using cc85 model equation ( [ winddensity ] ) , assuming the mass fraction of hydrogen for solar abundances @xmath85 .",
    "the ionization fraction @xmath86 is also calculated by spex ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the total x - ray luminosity between two frequencies @xmath71 and @xmath72 is written as @xmath87}&\\approx&1.5\\times10^{8}l_{\\odot}\\;x_{\\rm h}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\beta^{3}}{\\alpha}\\frac{\\textrm{sfr}_{0}^{2}}{r_{200\\rm pc}}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\int_{0}^{\\infty}dr_{*}\\;r_{*}^{2}\\rho_{*}^{2}\\lambda_{\\rm n,-22}^{[\\nu_{1},\\nu_{2}]}\\left(\\frac{n_{e}}{n}\\right),\\label{lxhot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88}=\\lambda_{\\rm n}^{[\\nu_{1},\\nu_{2}]}/10^{-22}$ ] erg s@xmath6 @xmath82 , other variables are denoted in section [ sectcc85model ] .",
    "note the scaling of @xmath89 with sfr , and that equation ( [ winddensity ] ) gives @xmath58 sfr .",
    "thus equation ( [ lxhot ] ) shows that x - ray emission from the hot wind fluid scales as @xmath90 significantly steeper than the observed linear relation @xmath91 sfr for star - forming galaxies .",
    "in this paper we focus on the diffuse x - ray emission from the hot wind fluid . because the fraction of the observed hard x - ray emission that is actually due to diffuse gas rather than other sources is uncertain , we adopt the following relation between the diffuse emission at @xmath78 kev and sfr based on the discussion in section [ intro ] : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the fraction of the diffuse emission in x - rays due to the hot wind fluid , and @xmath94 is the observed mean relation between total x - ray emission and sfr . in general , we expect @xmath95 , as seen in m82 ( @xcite ) , but higher and lower values are considered throughout this paper . in section [ discussion ] we discuss constraints on @xmath96 based on some well - studied starbursts .",
    "theoretical constraints on the hot wind fluid from the observed diffuse x - ray emission can then be obtained by combining equations ( [ lxhot ] ) and ( [ diffuse ] ) such that @xmath97 where the hard x - ray emission is from 0.5 kev to 8 kev ( i.e. , @xmath98 kev and @xmath99 kev in equation [ [ lxhot ] ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_cooling ] ) .     between 0.5 - 8 kev ( upper ) , galactic center temperature @xmath100 ( middle ) and the ratio of the cooling and dynamic timescale @xmath101 ( lower ) as a function of @xmath27 for fixed @xmath40 .",
    "the wind launching radius @xmath102 pc and sfr @xmath103 yr@xmath6.,width=377 ]                there are five parameters in equation ( [ constraint ] ) : @xmath40 , @xmath27 , sfr , @xmath25 , and @xmath96 . using equation ( [ constraint ] )",
    ", the relation between any two of the five parameters can be constrained by the other three parameters . however , the constraints on the cc85 model , in particular , the parameter set of @xmath104 are of particular interest , since @xmath40 and @xmath27 determine the importance of the hot gas for driving matter out of the galaxy directly , and for driving swept up cold gas clouds out of the galaxy via ram pressure .",
    "if we fix @xmath96 in equation ( [ constraint ] ) , with a fixed @xmath25 ( or apply an independent model of @xmath105 ) , we can solve for the relation between @xmath40 , @xmath27 , and sfr .",
    "figure [ fig_lx ] shows x - ray luminosities @xmath89 as a function of sfr with some given values of @xmath104 ( black lines ) , compared with the diffuse luminosity @xmath106 with different @xmath96 ( blue lines ) .",
    "the radius @xmath25 is fixed at @xmath102 pc for illustrative purposes .",
    "other values of @xmath25 give similar results .",
    "the slope of @xmath89 is steeper than @xmath106 , due to the different scaling between bremsstrahlung emission from the hot wind @xmath107 sfr@xmath108 , and the observed x - ray luminosity @xmath91 sfr ( equations [ [ lxhot ] ] and [ [ diffuse ] ] ) .",
    "each point of intersection between two lines @xmath89 and @xmath106 for any value of @xmath96 gives a certain parameter set of @xmath40 , @xmath27 and sfr .",
    "for example , for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , figure [ fig_lx ] shows that @xmath89 intersects @xmath106 at sfr @xmath111m@xmath112 yr@xmath6 , implying that for @xmath109 , @xmath110 is only allowed for galaxies with sfr @xmath113m@xmath112 yr@xmath6 ; for sfr @xmath114m@xmath112 yr@xmath6 , @xmath110 produces too much diffuse x - ray emission . similarly , note that @xmath115 is completely ruled out because it always produces too much diffuse x - ray emission",
    "one might expect that in general higher values of @xmath27 ( i.e. , larger mass loading ) would always lead to higher diffuse x - ray luminosity and tighter constraints on the allowed range of sfr , but the @xmath116 lines for @xmath117 ( thin lines ) show that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , @xmath106 for @xmath118 falls below other lines with lower @xmath119 and 1 , this is because the temperature of the flow for @xmath120 is so cool that only a small amount of the emission from the wind fluid is in the x - ray band .",
    "in fact , multiple solutions for @xmath27 exist at fixed @xmath40 and sfr .",
    "for example , for @xmath109 and @xmath117 , both @xmath121 , and @xmath122 are valid solutions in the cc85 model for @xmath123m@xmath112 yr@xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig_lxhot ] makes the solutions for @xmath27 more explicit . for fixed",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath89 in equation ( [ lxhot ] ) has a maximum as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig_lxhot ] shows that @xmath89 is thereby peaked as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "for a given @xmath89 below the peak , there are two solutions for @xmath27 , one low , and another high .",
    "as shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig_lxhot ] , the low value of @xmath27 corresponds to high @xmath43 , and high @xmath27 to low @xmath43 .",
    "however , not all solutions of @xmath27 are physically realizable in the cc85 model , because of radiative cooling .",
    "the cc85 model assumes that the flow is adiabatic for @xmath124 and fluid cooling is not important throughout the wind profile . if the cooling timescale in a mass loaded wind @xmath125 becomes smaller than the local dynamical timescale @xmath126 , then this assumption is invalidated and the cc85 model must break down .",
    "the wind dynamical timescale is @xmath127 the total energy is @xmath128 , thus the cooling timescale is estimated by @xmath129 .",
    "note that the ratio of @xmath130 of the hot wind has its lowest value at @xmath131 ; thus we can focus on @xmath130 at @xmath131 as the strongest timescale constraint .",
    "if we take bremsstrahlung emission from the pure hydrogen gas as a lower limit for the cooling rate @xmath132 , we obtain an analytic upper bound on @xmath27 : @xmath133 the lower panel of figure [ fig_lxhot ] shows the numerical results for @xmath130 at @xmath131 , which decreases strongly with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath134 at high @xmath27 , these high-@xmath27 solutions are not physical in cc85 adiabatic wind model .",
    "figure [ fig_sfr1 ] shows both the solution for @xmath27 from equation ( 13 ) as a function of sfr , and constraints from radiative cooling .",
    "the thick lines in each panel are solutions for fixed @xmath109 for two different models of @xmath25 : @xmath102 pc and @xmath135 sfr@xmath136 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and fixed @xmath137 ( left panel ) and 0.1 ( right panel ) .",
    "the thin solid and dashed lines show the critical condition @xmath138 at @xmath131 from equation ( [ betaconstraint ] ) , where we have used the total emissivity @xmath139 from figure [ fig_cooling ] . above the line @xmath134 , the wind is radiative outside the host galaxy , and the cc85 model breaks down .",
    "for @xmath117 , there are two solutions for @xmath27 , but the high-@xmath27 solutions are excluded by the radiative cooling constraint ( equation [ [ betaconstraint ] ] ) . below the solution curves @xmath140 , and above these curves @xmath141 .",
    "importantly , one finds that compact rapidly star - forming galaxies should in general have relatively low @xmath27 . taking @xmath137 and @xmath102 pc ,",
    "we see that for @xmath4m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 that @xmath142 . for lower @xmath117 ,",
    "the limit on @xmath27 decreases to @xmath143 .",
    "thus , it does not appear possible for the cc85 alone to account for @xmath144 , as seems to be required in galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) shows that @xmath144 is required to match the observed galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "note that for lower assumed values of @xmath40 or @xmath145 all of the solution curves move down in @xmath27 , making the limits on @xmath27 even stronger .",
    "constraints on @xmath27 for a broader range of @xmath40 are showed in the @xmath146 plane in figure [ fig_sfr2 ] , which shows contours of solutions of @xmath147sfr@xmath148 yr@xmath15 by equation ( [ constraint ] ) , with fixed @xmath109 , and @xmath102 pc and @xmath135 sfr@xmath136 .",
    "for example , taking sfr@xmath103 yr@xmath6 , we see that @xmath142 for @xmath137 and @xmath149 for @xmath150 . also , we find that larger @xmath25 yields a smaller allowed @xmath104 space for the same sfrs .",
    "note that the cooling constraint equation ( [ betaconstraint ] ) is independent of equation ( [ constraint ] ) . combining equations ( [ constraint ] ) and ( [ betaconstraint ] ) by solving sfr by equation ( [ constraint ] ) as a function of @xmath40 , @xmath27 , @xmath25 and @xmath96 ,",
    "the cooling constraint becomes a function of @xmath96 .",
    "thus @xmath151 takes the form @xmath152}\\left(\\frac{n_{e}}{n_{\\rm h}}\\right)\\geq1,\\label{betaconstraint2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is independent of @xmath25 .",
    "the grey region above the thick solid diagonal line ( @xmath138 at @xmath131 ) in figure [ fig_sfr2 ] denotes radiative winds excluded by equation ( [ betaconstraint2 ] ) .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath27 are seen to decrease rapidly for lower @xmath40 and sfr at fixed @xmath96 .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite ignored the effect of gravity , because they focused on solutions for m82 with @xmath153 , and thus they derived a terminal velocity of the m82 outflow of @xmath154 km s@xmath6 , much higher than the escape velocity from the galaxy @xmath155 of a few hundred km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "if we consider the general constraint that requires @xmath156 for an unbound outflow we find that @xmath157 for @xmath158 km s@xmath6 , this criterion is not restrictive , but for deep gravitational potentials ( @xmath159 km s@xmath6 ) , this limit on @xmath27 becomes close to the constraints produced by the critical lines of @xmath138 in figures [ fig_sfr1 ] and [ fig_sfr2 ] .",
    "there are several parameters in our model for the difuse x - ray emission associated with galactic winds , including the diffuse fraction @xmath96 , the normalization factor for the observed @xmath23sfr correlation , and the selected x - ray energy range .",
    "it is important to investigate whether our constraints on @xmath40 and @xmath27 change with changing parameters in the model .",

    "another starburst with diffuse x - ray data is ngc 253 , which has an unabsorbed @xmath80 kev luminosity of @xmath169 erg s@xmath6 ( @xcite ) . taking the total sfr of ngc 253 as 5 @xmath166 yr@xmath6 ( @xcite )",

    "the middle and lower contour panels in figure [ fig_discuss ] show that the hard x - ray constraint is weaker than the soft x - ray constraints from equation ( [ lxsoft ] ) , but our basic conclusion that large @xmath27 is excluded in the cc85 model is not changed qualitatively .",
    "it is worthwhile to highlight the limitations of the cc85 model .",
    "note that the breakdown of the adiabatic cc85 model at large @xmath27 as a result of radiative cooling highlighted in section [ sect_lxsfr ] is consistent with @xcite , who showed that an adiabatic stationary solution of the wind does not exist with @xmath24 or @xmath0 larger than a critical value .",
    "too large @xmath0 produces a so - called bimodal solution of the flow ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which the densest inner regions immediately radiate away the deposited energy while the outer zones develop a strongly radiative wind .",
    "we compute the ratio of @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the volumetric heating rate inside the galaxy . since @xmath186 decreases as a function of radius inside the galaxy , we focus on the ratio @xmath186 at the center of the host galaxy ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "if @xmath188 at the center , the hot fluid becomes radiative and unstable as discussed by @xcite and their series of papers , and again the assumptions of the cc85 model break down .",
    "although the thick solid line in figure [ fig_sfr2 ] corresponds to @xmath138 , we find that it gives a similar bound to @xmath189 at @xmath65 , so that for @xmath27 above this line we expect an unstable and radiative hot fluid inside the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the cc85 model also has some other simplifications .",
    "in particular , it assumes spherical symmetry and radius - independent energy thermalization and mass - loading efficiency densities ( i.e. , constant @xmath190 and @xmath191 in the cc85 model , see appendix [ cc85appendix ] ) .",
    "the issue of spherical symmetry has been addressed by @xcite , who find that it is possible to use the spherical analytical cc85 model to predict the wind fluid properties and x - ray emission from a disklike starburst for m82-like systems .",
    "similarly , one might imagine that a more realistic volumetric energy thermalization and mass - loading efficiency densities that are functions of radius would change the properties of the wind solutions and call our results into question .",
    "for simplicity if we assume a radius - dependent energy and mass injection density @xmath192 and @xmath193 in the cc85 model , the solutions of the hot wind ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) change inside the galaxy @xmath194 ( see equations [ [ powerlaw1 ] ] , [ [ powerlaw2 ] ] and [ [ dimenless24 ] ] in appendix [ cc85appendix ] as the solutions ) .",
    "for example , the mach number of the wind becomes @xmath195}$ ] at @xmath196 for @xmath197 , which is different from the case of @xmath198 that @xmath199 at @xmath196 .",
    "for the purpose of this paper we focus on integrated constraints @xmath40 and @xmath27 given by equations ( [ parameter2 ] ) and ( [ parameter3 ] ) .",
    "for example , we find that for @xmath137 , the constraint on @xmath27 for sfr @xmath200 yr@xmath6 changes by less than a factor of 50% as a function of @xmath201 in the range of @xmath202 . for a wide range of @xmath41 , the basic conclusion in this paper that @xmath180 for sfr@xmath203 yr@xmath6 in the cc85 model still holds .",
    "of course real galaxies are clumpy , with a complex ism .",
    "it is worthwhile to study the effects of multiphase and clumpy nature of wind on the dynamics and x - ray emission of the wind .",
    "some hydrodynamical simulations with more realistic and complex wind structure ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) showed comparisons between x - ray emission in the model and observations , as well as estimate on mass - loading efficiency .",
    "however , these works are mostly applied for m82-like and dwarf starbursts .",
    "more detailed x - ray comparisions between models and observations should be done for starburst galaxies across a wide range of sfrs in the future .",
    "in this paper we constrain the properties of any potential hot galactic wind from galaxies varying from dwarf starbursts to ulirgs using the adiabatic hot wind model of @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that this model provides a good description of the hot wind fluid ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use the observed total x - ray luminosities of galaxies to constrain the efficiency @xmath40 ( i.e. , energy input rate ; eq .  [ parameter2 ] ) and the mass - loading efficiency @xmath27 ( eq .  [ parameter3 ] ) of the hot wind .",
    "we first showed that the diffuse hard x - ray luminosity from any putative hot outflow should scale as @xmath107 sfr@xmath108 for fixed @xmath40 and @xmath27 ( eq .",
    "[ lxhot ] ) .",
    "however , observations show a linear relation between the total galactic x - ray luminosity and sfr ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lx ] ) .",
    "if we attribute a fraction ( @xmath204 ) of this total emission to the hot wind fluid we derive constraints on @xmath40 and @xmath27 as a function of sfr and the wind launching radius @xmath25 ( figs .",
    "[ fig_sfr1 ] and [ fig_sfr2 ] ) .",
    "we showed that for fixed @xmath145 there exist multiple solutions for @xmath27 ( one low and one high ) as a function of @xmath40 and sfr ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lxhot ] ) .",
    "we highlight the importance of radiative cooling for the heavily mass - loaded high-@xmath27 solutions , which invalidates the adiabatic cc85 model ( eq . [ betaconstraint ] ) .",
    "the breakdown of the cc85 model at large @xmath27 is consistent with @xcite , who showed that the adiabatic stationary solution of the wind does not exist with @xmath24 or @xmath0 larger than a critical value . as a result",
    ", we showed that only moderate mass - loading is allowed in the cc85 model .",
    "for example , as figure [ fig_sfr2 ] gives , for reasonable values of the thermalization efficiency @xmath205 , and for @xmath4m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 we find that @xmath180 ; higher values of @xmath27 would require that significantly more of the total x - ray luminosity of star - forming galaxies be attributable to the hot flow , in conflict with observations that find that the x - ray luminosities of galaxies are dominated by compact objects .",
    "these conclusion do not change for reasonable variations about our fiducial model ( fig .",
    "[ fig_discuss ] ) .    our result that @xmath180 for sfr@xmath203 yr@xmath6 shows that it does not appear possible for an adiabatic cc85 model alone to account for @xmath144 as seems to be required by integrated constraints on the efficiency of stellar feedback in galaxies @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) show that @xmath144 is required to match the observed galaxy stellar mass function .",
    "however , it remains possible that the swept up cold gas carries most of the mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or that other wind driving mechanisms such as momentum deposition by supernovae and radiation pressure on dust ( @xcite ) or cosmic rays ( @xcite ) dominate wind driving .",
    "finally , there are several additional studies that can further constrain and explain hot winds .",
    "first , since the cc85 model assumes a radius - independent energy input and mass - loading efficiency densities in the wind , it is worthwhile to investigate the effects of multiphase and clumpy nature of winds on their dynamics and x - ray emission across a wide range of galactic sfrs .",
    "we encourage more detailed multi - dimensional simulations like those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but for massive starbursts like arp220 and other ulirgs to assess their integrated x - ray emission for comparison with observations .",
    "second , the inclusion of a model of cold cloud acceleration and destruction in the cc85 model may further constrain the hot wind model .",
    "note that a traditional way to explain the cold gas in galactic winds is that the cold gas clouds enter the sn - heated hot wind flow at relatively low velocity and are accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot wind . in a future work",
    ", we will combine a model of cold cloud acceleration and destruction with the cc85 model to constrain energy thermalization and hot - wind mass - loading efficiency in individual systems that have measured cold cloud velocities , incorporating the constraints on the hot wind determined in this paper .",
    "lastly , it is clear that radiative cooling is important for the dynamics of outflows across a wide range of parameter space of thermalization input and high mass - loading efficiency . formulating radiative solutions for high@xmath206 winds and comparing with observations is an important direction for future work .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for comments that have allowed us to improve our paper . d.z .",
    "and t.a.t .",
    "thank smita mathur and david weinberg for helpful discussions on the cooling functions of x - ray emission and wind mechanisms . t.a.t .",

    "cc85 present a spherical thermal winds where gravitational forces can be ignored .",
    "assuming inside the radius of the starburst region @xmath25 hte total mass and energy input are @xmath0 and @xmath24 respectively , with an averaged injected efficiencies per unit volume in the galaxy being @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the one - dimensional hydrodynamic equations for the hod fluid are @xmath210=q.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solutions for the mach number @xmath211 of the hot wind fluid are given in cc85 by ( see also @xcite ) @xmath212^{(1+\\gamma)/[2(1 + 5\\gamma ) ] } \\left[\\frac{3\\gamma+1/m^{2}}{1 + 3\\gamma}\\right]^{-(3\\gamma+1)/(5\\gamma+1)}=\\frac{r}{r},\\ ] ] for @xmath194 and @xmath213}=\\left(\\frac{r}{r}\\right)^{2}.\\ ] ] for @xmath124 .",

    "if we assume a power - law distributed @xmath190 and @xmath191 for radius - dependent energy - injection and mass - loading efficiencies , i.e. , @xmath193 and @xmath192 with @xmath217 , the solutions for the mach number @xmath211 for @xmath194 becomes @xmath212^{(1+\\gamma)/[2(1 + 5\\gamma-\\xi-\\xi\\gamma ) ] } \\left[\\frac{(3-\\xi)\\gamma+(1-\\xi)/m^{2}}{(1-\\xi)+(3-\\xi)\\gamma}\\right]^{-(1 + 3\\gamma-\\xi-\\xi\\gamma)/[(1-\\xi)(1 + 5\\gamma-\\xi-\\xi\\gamma)]}=\\frac{r}{r},\\label{powerlaw1}\\ ] ] for @xmath218 , and @xmath212^{(1+\\gamma)/8\\gamma}\\textrm{exp}\\left[\\frac{1}{4\\gamma}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{m^{2}}\\right)\\right]=\\frac{r}{r},\\label{powerlaw2}\\ ] ] for @xmath219 . and",
    "the dimensionless equation ( [ dimenless22 ] ) becomes @xmath220 while other solutions are the same as the case of the uniformly distributed @xmath190 and @xmath191 . using these models of @xmath221",
    ", we have calculated the constraint on @xmath27 for comparison with the results presented in this paper .",
    "for example , for the same @xmath25 , sfr , @xmath96 and @xmath137 , but varying @xmath201 from 0 to 3 , we find that constraints on @xmath27 for sfr @xmath200 yr@xmath6 change by less than a factor of 50% . for a wide range of @xmath41 , the basic conclusion in this paper that @xmath180 for sfr@xmath203 yr@xmath6 in the cc85 model is not changed .",
