    "the prevailing approach to quantum computation evolved from classical reversible algorithmic computation ( bennett 1979 , fredkin and toffoli 1982 ) , where a stored program drives a sequence of elementary logically reversible transformations .",
    "in reversible - algorithmic computation a time - varying hamiltonian drives a sequence of unitary transformations ( benioff 1982 , feynman 1985 ) .",
    "it was then found ( first by deutsch 1985 ) that entanglement , interference and measurement yield in principle dramatic speed - ups over the corresponding classical algorithms in solving some problems .    in spite of this important result ,",
    "this form of computation faces two possibly basic difficulties .",
    "its speed - ups rely on quantum interference , which requires computation reversibility .",
    "decoherence may then limit computation size below practical interest .",
    "only two speed - ups of practical interest have been found so far ( factoring and database search ) , and none since 1996 .",
    "reversible - algorithmic computation is not the most general form of quantum computation .",
    "its limitations justify reconsidering quantum ground - state computation ( castagnoli 1998 , farhi et al .",
    "2001 , kadowaki 2002 , among others ) , a formerly neglected approach still believed to be mathematically intractable .",
    "quantum ground - state computation evolved from classical ground - state computation ( kirkpatrick & selman 1994 , among others ) , a well - developed approach competitive with algorithmic computation for solving boolean networks .",
    "a boolean network is a set of nodes ( boolean variables ) variously connected by gates and wires that impose relations on the variables they connect ( fig .",
    "1 ) . a boolean assignment satisfying all gates and wires is a network solution .",
    "roughly speaking , all np problems can readily be converted to the problem of solving a boolean network .    in quantum ground - state computation ,",
    "one sets up a quantum network whose energy is minimum when all gates and wires are satisfied . in quantum annealing , one form of ground - state computation ,",
    "coupling the network with a heat - bath of suitably decreasing temperature relaxes the network to its ground state , a mixture of solutions ( we assume with no significant restriction that there is at least one ) . measuring the node variables ( hermitian operators with eigenvalues @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) yields a solution .",
    "it is believed that quantum annealing yields a ( still ill - defined ) speed - up over its classical counterpart .",
    "quantum tunneling reduces the risk that the network , in its way toward the absolute energy minimum , remains trapped in local minima ( e.g. kadowaki 2002 )",
    ". however , long simulation times seriously limit research on this approach .    here",
    "we develop a hybrid mode of computation .",
    "we implement wires by ground - state computation .",
    "we implement gates as algebraic identities resulting from quantum symmetries and statistics .",
    "we show that relaxation - computation time is comparable with that an easier ( more loosely constrained ) logical network where all the gate constraints implemented by quantum symmetries are removed .",
    "the comparison is based on a special projection method .",
    "we show that the relaxation of the actual network can be obtained as a special projection of the relaxation of the easier comparison network .",
    "this projection method shortcuts mathematical complexity and sheds light on the nature of this form of computation .",
    "we conjecture that for this computation mode all hard - to - solve ( np ) networks become easy ( p ) and support this conjecture with plausible estimates .",
    "decoherence is not expected to be as serious a problem for this computation model as for algorithmic computation since the network state is intentionally a thermal mixture during most of the computation .",
    "this discussion of quantum computation still belongs to the realm of principles , like other literature on quantum ground - state computation , while algorithmic - reversible computation is now almost a technology .",
    "nevertheless it is worth starting over with a new approach that might overcome fundamental limitations of algorithmic computation .",
    "we use a network normal form composed just of wires and triodes ( fig.1 ) . each triode @xmath2  properly a partial gate  connects three nodes labeled @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( replaced by collective indices in fig.1 ) with the sum-2 relation @xmath6 where @xmath7 s are boolean variables and @xmath8 denotes arithmetical sum .",

    "using a different @xmath203 for each @xmath142 , with average value @xmath204 , yields the same result : @xmath205 in @xmath206  should be  replaced by @xmath207 .",

    "this form of quantum computation is expected to be robust , since it relies on thermal mixtures , not pure states , and is plausibly conjectured to be fast , turning all np problems in principle into p. as in quantum algorithmic computation , the speed - up is due to the extradynamical character of the computation ( castagnoli & finkelstein 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "this model of computation highlights the conceptual difference between how structures can be assembled in the classical and quantum domain .",
    "quantally it is as though one could assemble a jigsaw puzzle simply by piling the pieces up and letting gravity lower them into mutual positions that solve the puzzle , analogously to quantum wire relaxation .",
    "classically this way of assembling the pieces would be plagued by local energy  minima .",
