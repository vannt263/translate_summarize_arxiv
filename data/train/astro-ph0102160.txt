    "the power spectrum is one of most important statistical measure to quantify the clustering features of large scale mass density distribution traced by galaxies .",
    "it directly reflects the physical scales of the processes that affect structure formation .    in paper",
    "i ( fang & feng 2000 ) , the method of measuring galaxy power spectrum with the multiresolution analysis of discrete wavelet transformation ( dwt ) is developed .",
    "it has been shown that the dwt analysis provides a lossless estimation of the power spectrum .",
    "the dwt power spectrum estimator is optimized in the sense that the spatial resolution automatically adapts to the perturbation wavelength under consideration .",
    "since the dwt analysis has strong capability of suppressing the off - diagonal components of the covariance of density fluctuations , the dwt estimator is convenient to deal with data sets with a large volume and complex geometry .",
    "moreover , the dwt estimator can fully avoid the alias effect which appears in usual binning schemes . because poisson process possesses diagonal covariance in the dwt representation , the poisson sampling and selection effects on the power spectrum are suppressed to a minimum .",
    "besides these technical advantages of the computation of power spectrum , the dwt space - scale decomposition provides a physical insight into the clustering behavior in phase space , i.e. scale plus physical position . even for second order statistics , i.e. the covariance of density fluctuations , the space - scale decomposition can reveal some clustering behaviors , such as two - point correlation in phase space , which can not be measured by decomposition with modes non - localized in phase space .",
    "moreover , the covariance in dwt representation can avoid the difficulty caused by the central limit theorem ( fan & bardeen 1995 . )    the algorithm developed in paper i is mainly for 1-d sample .",
    "many algorithms for 1-d sample can directly be generalized into 3-d .",
    "a problem especially for 3-d dwt power spectrum estimator is on rotational invariance .",
    "3-d dwt modes is given by the direct product of 1-d dwt modes , and therefore , each of the 3-d dwt modes is described by three positive integers @xmath6 corresponding to the scales of the mode in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions , respectively .",
    "thus , there are two types of modes : diagonal mode with @xmath10 ; off - diagonal mode for which the three numbers @xmath6 are not the same",
    ". the dwt estimator can provide two types of power spectra : 1 . diagonal power spectrum given by the powers on diagonal modes , 2 . off - diagonal power spectrum given by the powers on off - diagonal modes .    because the two types of modes have different spatial invariance , the diagonal and off - diagonal dwt power spectra are very flexible to deal with configuration - related problems in the power spectrum detection . in this paper",
    ", we will study both diagonal and off - diagonal power spectra with the las campanas redshift survey galaxies , and relevant simulation samples and mock catalogues .",
    "the purpose is to demonstrate how the two types of power spectra are applied to estimate the uncertainties of power spectrum measurement caused by various anisotropies of the sample .",
    "it includes , for instance , the irregular geometry of the survey with very low filling factor , the scale - dependence of redshift distortion , and the inhomogeneity caused by the selection function .",
    "these results insure that the dwt estimator is capable of providing a stable measurement of the lcrs galaxy power spectrum and the best - fitting parameters of bias and velocity dispersion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "the dwt power spectrum estimator is briefly introduced with the emphasis on the property and algorithm for the off - diagonal dwt power spectrum . ",
    "3 describes the real and mock samples of galaxies .",
    "the applications of the diagonal and off - diagonal power spectra to the configuration - related problems are presented in  4 .",
    "the results of the dwt power spectra of the lcrs , both diagonal and off - diagonal , and their error estimation are given in  5 .",
    "the best - fitting values of the bias parameters and velocity dispersion are given in  5 as well .",
    "finally , conclusions are stated in  6 .",
    "if the position measurement is perfectly precise , the observed galaxy number density distribution can be written as @xmath11 where coordinate @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the total number of galaxies , @xmath14 is the position of the @xmath15th galaxy , @xmath16 is its weight , and @xmath17 the 3-d dirac @xmath18 function . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider the sample which is contained in a spatial box with spatial ranges of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is not necessary that the box @xmath22 is fully filled by sample , i.e. , allows @xmath23 within some areas inside the box .",
    "the observed galaxy number density distribution is considered to be a realization of a poisson point process with an intensity @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 is selection function , and @xmath26 the density contrast fluctuation on the underlying matter field .",
    "the goal of power spectrum measurement is to estimate the power spectrum of the density fluctuations @xmath27 - 1 $ ] from the observed realization @xmath28 - 1 $ ] .",
    "different power spectrum estimators adopt different decomposition of @xmath29 .",
    "the dwt decomposition is based on the orthogonal and complete set of 3-d wavelet basis @xmath30 , which can be constructed by a direct product of 1-d wavelet basis as @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 .",
    "the wavelet @xmath35 is localized in phase ( scale and physical position ) space , i.e. it is non - zero mainly in a volume @xmath36 , and around the position @xmath37 ( fang & thews 1998 . ) the bases eq.(2 ) are orthonormal with respect both @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "the dwt decomposition of @xmath42 - 1 $ ] is then given by @xmath43\\psi_{\\bf j , l}({\\bf x})d{\\bf x},\\ ] ] since wavelets are admissible , i.e. @xmath44 , eq.(3 ) becomes @xmath45 thus the fluctuations in galaxy number density can be described by the wavelet function coefficients ( wfc ) @xmath46 , which is the density fluctuation on scale @xmath47 localized at the position @xmath48 .      for a given scale @xmath38",
    ", there are totally @xmath49 wfc variables .",
    "all second order statistics on the scale @xmath38 can be drawn from the covariance of these wfcs @xmath50 it has been shown in paper i that the power of the fluctuations on the modes with the scale index @xmath38 can be estimated by @xmath51 where @xmath52 ^ 2,\\ ] ] and @xmath53 the physical meaning of eq.(6 ) is clear .",
    "the term @xmath54 is the mean power of @xmath38 modes measured from the observed realization @xmath55 , and the term @xmath56 is the power on @xmath38 modes due to the poisson noise . for a volume - limited survey ,",
    "the mean galaxy density @xmath57 is independent of the redshift .",
    "the poisson noise power is thus simply @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is usually referred to as the dwt power spectrum .",
    "paper i showed that for 1-d sample in space @xmath60 the dwt power spectrum @xmath61 is a band averaged fourier spectrum given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fourier power spectrum with wavenumber @xmath64 ( for simplicity , we refer to @xmath65 as the wavenumber below ) , and @xmath66 is the fourier transform of the basic wavelet @xmath67 @xmath68 which is orthogonal to the monopole , i.e. @xmath69 and localized in wavenumber space .",
    "for the daubechies 4 wavelet ( daubechies 1992 ) , @xmath70 has symmetrically distributed peaks with respect to @xmath71 .",
    "the first highest peaks are non - zero in two narrow ranges centered at @xmath72 with width @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . besides the first peak , there are  side lobes \" in @xmath70 ( see also fig .",
    "however , for the daubechies 4 the area under the  side lobes \" is not more than 2% of the first peak .",
    "therefore @xmath61 is good estimation of the band - averaged fourier power spectrum centered at wavenumber @xmath74 with the band width as @xmath75 for 1-d sample of ly@xmath76 forests , the dwt power spectrum is found to be smoothly related to the fourier power spectrum by eqs.(11 ) and ( 12 ) ( feng & fang 2000 . )",
    "it is straightforward to generalize eq.(9 ) to 3-d .",
    "we have @xmath77 because the cosmic density field is isotropic , the fourier power spectrum @xmath78 is dependent only on @xmath79 obviously , the dwt power spectrum is invariant with respect to the cyclic permutation of index as @xmath80    considering eq.(11 ) and ( 14 ) , we can formally define a band center wavenumber @xmath81 corresponding to the 3-d mode @xmath38 as @xmath82 for an isotropic random field , the fourier modes with the same @xmath65 [ eq.(14 ) ] are statistically equivalent .",
    "however , the dwt modes with the same @xmath81 [ eq.(16 ) ] are not statistically equivalent , because the dwt modes are not rotationally invariant . a fourier mode @xmath83",
    "can be obtained by a rotation of mode @xmath84 as long as @xmath85 .",
    "however , the dwt modes do nt have the same property .",
    "generally , one can not transform a mode @xmath86 to @xmath87 by a rotation , even when @xmath88 .",
    "because of different configurations [ eq.(2 ) ] between them , the condition @xmath89 generally does not imply @xmath90 this invariance holds only when @xmath86 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath87 .    with this property , one can define two types of the dwt power spectra : 1 . the diagonal power spectrum given by @xmath59 on diagonal modes",
    "@xmath91 , and 2 . off - diagonal power spectrum given by other modes .    from eq.(13 ) , the diagonal power spectrum @xmath92 is related to the fourier power spectrum by @xmath93 where the window function @xmath94 is @xmath95 with the normalization @xmath96 it should be emphasized that the window function @xmath94 does not contain any free parameters , and is completely determined by the basis used for the dwt decomposition .",
    "therefore , it is different from the ordinary convolution with filter containing adjustable parameters .",
    "eq.(11 ) shows that in the scale space the window function @xmath94 is localized around @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the diagonal power spectrum @xmath61 is a band - average of the isotropic fourier power spectrum @xmath63 with the central frequency @xmath98 . as an example , fig .",
    "1 demonstrates the linear diagonal dwt power spectra in three typical cosmological models , i.e. the @xmath5 cold dark matter , ( @xmath5cdm ) , @xmath99cdm , and the standard cdm ( scdm ) .",
    "they are calculated by eq.(18 ) , in which the @xmath63 are taken to be the correspondingly linear isotropic fourier power spectra ( bardeen et al .",
    "the wavelet filter @xmath70 [ eq.(10 ) ] is displayed in a small frame box .",
    "for off - diagonal modes , one can also calculate the linear non - diagonal dwt power spectrum @xmath100 via eq.(13 .",
    ") however , in this case , @xmath100 can not simply be identified as a band average of the isotropic fourier power spectrum @xmath63 centered at @xmath101 .    nevertheless , @xmath81 is useful to calibrate the physical scale of a given @xmath38 .",
    "since we use the dwt decomposition , it is convenient to label the spatial scale in figures by @xmath102 .",
    "however , the spatial scale for a given @xmath38 actually is dependent on the size of the sample @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , for samples with different @xmath60 , the same @xmath102 do not have the same physical scale . to avoid the possible confusion caused by this , we label the figures on the top with the wavenumber @xmath104 .",
    "we use the las campanas redshift survey ( shectman et al . 1996 ) to demonstrate the dwt power spectrum estimator , including both diagonal and off - diagonal modes .",
    "the lcrs consists of 26418 redshifts of galaxies , covering over 720 square degree in six @xmath105 strips .",
    "three each of the strips are in the north and south galactic caps , respectively .",
    "the galaxies in the lcrs are selected from a ccd catalog obtained in r - band .",
    "the luminosity function has been shown to be best - fitted by a schechter function with @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 h@xmath109mpc@xmath110 for the absolute magnitude of @xmath111(lin et al .",
    "1996 . )",
    "we first convert the heliocentric redshifts of galaxies to comoving distances @xmath112 in a einstein - de sitter universe . as the survey depth is not very large ,",
    "the differences among the distances given different models are less than 2% .",
    "this correction has been taken into account in our calculation .",
    "analysis is carried out for the sample with upper cut - off of the recession velocity 51000kms@xmath2 , which is approximately the survey depth @xmath113 450 h@xmath2 mpc . to perform dwt power spectrum analysis",
    ", we further enclose each strip into a cubic box with size of 500 h@xmath2 mpc .",
    "accordingly , the spatial size resolved by one - dimensional mode on a scale @xmath102 is @xmath114 h@xmath2 mpc .",
    "a slice - like geometry of the strips fills only a very small fraction of the cubic volume .",
    "we define a filling factor by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the volume occupied by the survey sample , and @xmath117 is the length of the box . for a given scale @xmath118 , there are totally @xmath119 dwt modes .",
    "since the wavelet @xmath120 is localized in physical space , the wfcs of modes located in the empty regions will be zero .",
    "consequently , for the scale @xmath118 , only @xmath121 modes contribute to the dwt power spectrum . in this case , the summations overing @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 in eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) run only for the @xmath121 modes , and the normalization factor @xmath125 is replaced by @xmath121 .    the effect of the boundary can be estimated with the so - called  influence \" cone ( pando & fang 1998 . )",
    "that is , if the base @xmath126 is well localized in the interval @xmath127 , then the wfcs @xmath128 corresponding to position @xmath129 will only measure fluctuations in the interval @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath129 is at the boundary , the wfcs @xmath128 measures the difference between the density contrasts inside and outside the boundary .",
    "thus , for a zero padding of the empty regions , the power on the boundary mode would be statistically overestimated .",
    "hence , the uncertainty ( most likely overestimation ) of the power spectrum caused by the boundary modes would be of the order of @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the number of boundary modes on scale @xmath38 .",
    "one can also pad the empty regions with galaxies created by a poisson sampling according to the same radial selection function as the lcrs . in this case ,",
    "the difference between the density contrasts inside and outside the boundary is erased , so contribute little to the dwt power spectrum and will cause small underestimation . for small scales",
    "@xmath133 , the boundary effect is negligible for both zero padding and poisson sampling .",
    "to access the accuracy of recovering power spectrum with the dwt , we construct mock lcrs samples .",
    "first we produce ten realizations of the n - body simulation for each model of the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) , low density flat model ( @xmath5cdm ) , and a variant of scdm model ( @xmath99cdm ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath134 are taken to be ( 1.0,0.0,0.5,0.55 ) for scdm , ( 0.3,0.7,0.21,0.85 ) for @xmath5cdm , and ( 1.0,0.0,0.25,0.55 ) for @xmath99cdm .",
    "the linear power spectrum is taken from the fitting formula given in bardeen et al .",
    "we use modified ap@xmath109 m code ( couchman , 1991 ) to evolve @xmath135 cold dark matter particles in a periodic cube of length 256h@xmath2mpc . for the scdm model ,",
    "the starting redshift is taken to be @xmath136 , and for lcdm and @xmath99cdm , @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "the force softening parameter @xmath138 in the comoving system decreases with time as @xmath139 .",
    "its initial value is taken to be @xmath140 h@xmath2 kpc , and the minimum value to be @xmath141 h@xmath2 kpc , corresponding to 15% and 5% , respectively , of the grid size .",
    "for the single - step integration of time evolution , we use the `` leap - frog '' scheme , the total number of integration steps down to @xmath142 is 600 .",
    "we first assume an unbiased galaxy distribution relative to underlying dark matter .",
    "the mock catalogues are then constructed proceeding in the following steps . 1 .",
    "we locate the observer randomly in the simulation box .",
    "since the survey depth and width of the lcrs are larger than our simulations , we replicate the slice sample periodically be extending to redshift @xmath143 .",
    "3 . from the space coordinate of the galaxy ,",
    "work out its redshift and galactic coordinates , for which the angular mask of the lcrs is further applied .",
    "4 . according to r - band luminosity function and the average sampling rates respectively for 50-fiber and 112-fiber subset of the observation data , we determine whether the galaxy is admitted into the mock sample using poisson sampling . similar to the estimation of fourier power spectrum in the lcrs catalogue ( lin et.al . , 1996 ) , the uneven sampling rate has little effect on measurements of the dwt power spectrum . finally in step 5 , the photometric catalog is then generated by assigning each galaxy a specific absolute magnitude .",
    "in order to demonstrate the reliability of the dwt power spectrum estimator , we first calculate the diagonal dwt power spectrum for the simulation ensembles in the scdm , @xmath5cdm , and @xmath99cdm models .",
    "the sample is in a @xmath144 h@xmath110 mpc@xmath109 box .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "2 . for comparison ,",
    "2 also plots the non - linear dwt power spectrum calculated by eq.(18 ) , in which the fourier power spectrum is taken from the peacock & dodds s fitting formulae ( 1996 . ) obviously , the dwt power spectrum estimator is excellent to recover the analytic models over a wide wavenumber range resolved by our simulations , i.e. @xmath145 h mpc@xmath2 .    for the magnitude - limited mock samples of the lcrs in real space with size @xmath146 h@xmath110 mpc@xmath109 ,",
    "the estimated diagonal dwt power spectrum are shown by solid squares in fig .",
    "the error bars are given by standard 1-@xmath0 deviations taken over 10 realizations .",
    "comparing with the power spectrum calculated by eq.(18 ) , one finds that the dwt power spectrum estimator can successfully recover the non - linear spectra of the mass fields on scales @xmath147 , i.e. , @xmath148 h mpc@xmath2 , while the power is systematically underestimated for @xmath149 h mpc@xmath2    recall that the fourier power spectrum also shows a suppression of power spectrum on large scales .",
    "it is generally believed that the suppression of the fourier spectrum is due to the following two reasons : 1 . the uncertainty in determination of mean density ( peacock & nicholson 1991 ; tadros & efstathiou , 1996 ) ; 2 . the finite volume of the survey .",
    "the large scale suppression of the dwt power spectrum have different reasons .",
    "for the dwt power spectrum estimator , the overall mean density is not needed .",
    "the uncertainty of the mean density does nt affect the dwt power spectrum . as a numerical test",
    ", we computed the dwt power spectrum in an arbitrary selected thin slab in the simulation box with the same filling factor as that of the lcrs .",
    "we found that the scatter of the dwt power spectra from different slabs is much less than the suppression shown in fig .",
    "2 . accordingly , the uncertainty of the overall mean density is _ not _",
    "responsible for the suppression of the dwt power spectrum on large scales .",
    "the suppression of the dwt power spectrum on large scales is because the diagonal mode @xmath150 can not match with the slice - like geometry of the survey . for the lcrs",
    ", the average thickness in declination is estimated to be @xmath151 h@xmath2 mpc , i.e. only @xmath152 3% of the side lengths in the other two dimensions .",
    "therefore , the perturbations on scales @xmath153 h mpc@xmath2 , or @xmath154 , in the dimension of declination are poorly sampled .",
    "this leads to an underestimation of power spectrum with @xmath154 in the direction of declination (  3.1 ) . based on above discussions , for mock samples with the lcrs survey geometry , the diagonal power spectrum @xmath91 are capable of recovering the non - linear power spectrum on scales @xmath155 , but suffers an underestimation on scales @xmath154 .",
    "this geometric effect could also be fixed by the off - diagonal power spectrum as demonstrated in next subsection .      assuming that @xmath156 points along the direction of declination , @xmath157 the r.a . and @xmath158 the radial or redshift direction , the modes @xmath6 which can fit with the lcrs slice - like geometry are @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "we use the off - diagonal power spectrum @xmath161 with a fixed @xmath162 .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the off - diagonal dwt spectrum @xmath163 measured from subsets of the sample in a @xmath164 slab for scdm and @xmath5cdm models respectively , in which redshift distortion and selection effect have not been taken into account .",
    "clearly , it shows that the off - diagonal dwt power spectrum @xmath163 estimator is capable of reproducing the non - linear power spectrum on large scales .",
    "this power spectrum is in good agreement with the theoretical curves on large scales as @xmath165 h mpc@xmath2 .",
    "figure 5 plots the off - diagonal dwt spectra @xmath166 and @xmath163 in real space measured for the mock lcrs samples in the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "it again shows that the systematical underestimation of the powers on large scales is significantly erased .",
    "the off - diagonal dwt spectra @xmath163 and @xmath166 can be used for recovering the non - linear power spectrum of the mass field on scales as large as @xmath167 h mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of introducing selection function @xmath168 is to eliminate the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of mean number density of galaxies caused by the sampling of the survey .",
    "that is , the distribution with uniformly mean number density of galaxies can be recovered by weighting a galaxy at radial coordinate @xmath169 by factor @xmath170",
    ".    however , the effects of selection function actually are two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", it is to eliminate the inhomogeneity of the mean number density of the galaxy distribution . on the other hand",
    ", it causes an inhomogeneity in the correlations of the power spectrum .",
    "the later can be seen from the band - band correlation in the paper i , which showed that , if the selection function is slowly varying , the observed auto - correlation of power @xmath59 is @xmath171,\\ ] ] where @xmath172 is the power - power correlation before the poisson sampling , and therefore , cyclic invariant with respect to @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath173 the number @xmath174 in eq.(22 ) is the mean of @xmath175 in cell @xmath176 . since @xmath177 depends only on @xmath9 , the last term in the r.h.s . of eq.(22 ) violates the permutation invariance .",
    "that is , the correlations @xmath178 are on longer cyclic invariant . in other words , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath59 is anisotropic .    to estimate this effect , we calculate the off - diagonal power spectra @xmath179 and @xmath180 vs. @xmath102 for @xmath5cdm simulation sample in real space , and the selection function is taken to be that for the lcrs galaxies , but in plane parallel approximation .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "the two spectra @xmath179 and @xmath180 show some difference , which is not significant on all scales @xmath181 within 1-@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , with the dwt estimator , the effect of the anisotropy given by the lcrs selection function can be ignored at least for the power measurement on scales similar to @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "usually , the redshift distortion is considered to have two effects on the power spectrum measurement : 1 .",
    "the enhancing of power on large scales due to the linear effect of redshift distortion ; 2 .",
    "the suppressing of power on small scales due to the random motions of galaxies inside virialized groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the general theory of the two effects on the dwt power spectrum is given in appendix .",
    "an interesting result is that the effect of the galaxy random velocity field @xmath182 upon the power on mode @xmath38 is mainly given by the power of the pairwise velocity dispersion of the same mode .",
    "therefore , the dwt power spectrum can be employed for extracting information of the scale dependence of galaxy velocity fluctuations .",
    "recall that in the recovery of the real space fourier power spectrum from redshift distorted measurement , it is usually assumed that the peculiar velocity dispersion is scale - independent .",
    "however , theory and measurement of galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion do not indicate a scale - independent , but weakly scale - dependent velocity field .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to estimate the uncertainty caused by the assumption of the scale - independence of the velocity fluctuations .",
    "let s use the plane parallel approximation . in this case , the redshift distortion is determined by the @xmath9-component of the galaxy velocity field , i.e. @xmath183 . subjecting @xmath183 to a dwt decomposition , we have @xmath184 the wfcs of the velocity field , @xmath185 , describes the radial velocity difference with spatial separation on scale @xmath38 at position @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , it is the pairwise velocity on scale @xmath38 at position @xmath39 .",
    "the redshift distorted dwt power spectrum @xmath186 is approximately given by ( see appendix ",
    "a.2 ) @xmath187 where @xmath188 is determined by the geometry of the mode @xmath189 @xmath190 and @xmath191 is the power of the pairwise velocity dispersion on scale @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath192 therefore , comparing @xmath186 with @xmath59 , we are able to determine @xmath191 .    as an example",
    ", we study the assumption of the scale - independence of galaxy velocity fluctuations .",
    "one can show that , if the power of pairwise velocity is scale - independent , we have @xmath193 therefore , the scale - dependence of the velocity fluctuations can be detected by off - diagonal dwt power spectrum with a fixed @xmath158 ( redshift direction ) .",
    "figure 7 plots @xmath194 vs. @xmath102 in redshift space for the @xmath5cdm simulation samples .",
    "it can be seen clearly from fig . 7",
    "that the dwt power spectrum @xmath194 in redshift space is almost parallel to the theoretical non - linear spectrum in real space .",
    "the difference between the redshift distortion suppressions of mode @xmath195 and @xmath196 is no more than a factor of 2 .",
    "that is , the suppressing factor @xmath197 const , and therefore eq.(28 ) approximately hold in the scale range of spectrum @xmath194 .",
    "similar results are obtained for models scdm and @xmath99cdm models .",
    "the assumption of a scale independent power of the pairwise velocity seems to be reasonable at least for the dwt power spectrum of the lcrs sample .",
    "figure 7 also presents the off - diagonal power spectra @xmath198 .",
    "obviously , @xmath198 significantly differs from @xmath194 in both shape and amplitude of the power . comparing to @xmath194",
    ", the amplitude of @xmath198 is enhanced on large scales and suppressed on small scales .",
    "the difference between the spectra @xmath194 and @xmath198 in redshift space is worth while to look at .",
    "for an isotropic velocity field , @xmath199 is cyclically invariant with respect to the index @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath200 the difference between @xmath198 and @xmath194 is simply given by the geometric factors @xmath188 , which are not cyclically invariant @xmath201 therefore , using the difference between @xmath198 and @xmath194 in redshift space we are able to directly measure the power spectrum of galaxy velocity field , @xmath202 or @xmath203 .",
    "with the preparations given in last sections , we can measure the dwt power spectrum of the lcrs galaxies . as discussed in  4.1",
    ", the diagonal power spectrum could provide a robust measurement of the non - linear power spectrum on scales of @xmath148 h mpc@xmath2 . in fig .",
    "8 , we present the results for the lcrs , where the diagonal dwt power spectra measured in the six slices are plotted by scatter symbols as indicated in the figure . the average value over the six strips , and over the three north as well as three south strips are also displayed by the connected lines , respectively .",
    "although the geometry of the six strips are actually quite different , and the filling factor is only about 0.9% , fig .",
    "8 indicates that the scatter of the power on scales of @xmath204 h mpc@xmath2 is rather small . comparing with fig .",
    "3 , we find that the scatter of the power in fig . 8 is within the range of 1-@xmath0 deviations given by the mock lcrs samples",
    ". therefore , most of the scatters in fig . 8 are probably from the cosmic variance .",
    "this result implies that the dwt power spectrum estimator is insensitive to the geometry of survey and filling factor .",
    "this feature allows us to directly compare the dwt power spectrum measurements from different surveys , or different region in a survey .    as indicated in fig .",
    "8 , the dwt power spectrum is capable of probing the fluctuation power on scales as small as @xmath205 h mpc@xmath2 ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "this is partially because the dwt decomposition is free from the  aliasing effect \" which may lead to underestimation of power on the scale of grid size ( jing 1992 , baugh & efstathiou , 1994 ) . at the scale @xmath207 , the number of effective modes is @xmath208 comparable to galaxy number in each slice , and thus the error bars for @xmath209 are mainly from the poisson noise . even on the smallest scale @xmath206",
    "the poisson correction is still much smaller than the detected power .",
    "therefore , the diagonal dwt power spectrum from @xmath210 to 2 h mpc@xmath2 is qualified for model discrimination .      in order to find the best values of the bias parameter and velocity dispersion , we compare the detected lcrs diagonal dwt power spectrum ( fig .",
    "8) with the fitting spectrum in redshift space , @xmath186 , given by eq.(13 ) , i.e. @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the fourier power spectrum in redshift space . for typical cdm models",
    ", @xmath212 can be taken from the fitting formula given by peacock and dodds ( 1994 ) .",
    "it is @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the non - linear mass power spectrum in real space , @xmath215 is redshift distortion parameter , @xmath216 the scale - independent linear biasing parameter , @xmath4 is 1-d peculiar velocity dispersion .",
    "@xmath217 describes the suppression of redshift distortion .    exactly speaking , one can not simply generalize eq.(13 ) to eq.(31 ) , because the redshift distortion of the dwt power spectrum is different from the fourier power spectrum .",
    "the pairwise velocity suppression of the dwt modes should be calculated based on eq.(25 ) , rather than via the fourier modes . moreover , eq.(32 ) is given by averaging over the directions of fourier modes , and therefore , it does nt match the anisotropic mode @xmath6 of eq.(31 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fitting of eq.(31 ) will provide worth information for diagonal modes , as the power of the galaxy random velocity field is approximately scale - independent (  4.4 ) .",
    "we treat @xmath216 and @xmath4 in eq.(31 ) as free parameters , and fit the power spectrum eq.(31 ) to the detected dwt power spectrum of lcrs . the result is shown in fig .",
    "9 , in which the 1-@xmath0 error bars of the observed dwt power spectrum are given by the scatter over the observed 6 slices themselves . as have been discussed in  4.1 , the dwt power spectrum at large scales ( @xmath218 ) are underestimated due to the slice - like geometric effect .",
    "we approximately compensate this effect in the observed dwt power spectrum by using the fractional damping of amplitude calculated from the mock samples in redshift space relative to the expected values from the non - linear fitting formula ( eq.(32 ) ) in each model respectively .",
    "the least square best fitting parameters @xmath216 and @xmath4 for each of models are presented in table 1 .",
    "table 1    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the scdm and @xmath5cdm parameter @xmath3 given in the table 1 is about the same as other measurements , such as @xmath219 for the 1.2jy iras survey ( cole et al .",
    "1995 ) ; @xmath220 ( tadros et al . 1999 ) and @xmath221 ( hamilton et al . 2000 ) for iras point source catalog redshift survey ( pscz ) .",
    "actually , our estimated @xmath3 in each cdm model is very close to the linear value @xmath222 .",
    "this result is consistent with the theory of redshift distortion in the dwt presentation , which shows that the linear effect on the diagonal dwt power spectrum is about the same as that given by eq.(32 ) ( see , appendix  a.1 . )",
    "the 1-d velocity dispersions given in table 1 look lower than other measurements in the lcrs galaxies .",
    "they are @xmath223kms@xmath2 ( jing et al . 1998 ) , and @xmath224 km s@xmath2 ( landy , szaley and broadhurst 1998 ) . yet",
    ", the first measurement is based on _ a priori _ infall model of galaxies . in the second measurement @xmath225",
    "is given by the width of an exponential distribution , or a lorentzian distribution in @xmath226 space .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath4 in eq.(31 ) is assumed to be the variance of a gaussian distribution of pairwise velocity . to fit a given power suppression by lorentzian and gaussian distributions",
    ", @xmath225 will always be larger than @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , if the suppression factor is equal to about 3 as shown by the spectra of fig . 7 .",
    "@xmath227 will be @xmath228 .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath4 given by the fitting of the scdm and @xmath5cdm basically are consistent with the second measurement .      as an example we detected the off - diagonal spectrum @xmath229 of the lcrs galaxies .",
    "the result is presented in fig . 10 .",
    "as mentioned in last section , eq.(31 ) can not be used to fit with off - diagonal dwt power spectrum , as @xmath230 is isotropic .",
    "one can expect that the fitting parameters of the spectrum eqs.(31 ) and ( 32 ) with an off - diagonal power spectrum would be systematically different from those of the diagonal power spectrum .",
    "this systematic difference actually contains valuable information .",
    "the best fitted spectra of @xmath229 for models",
    "scdm , @xmath99cdm and @xmath5cdm are also shown in fig .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are given in table 1 , which clearly show the difference between the parameters of diagonal and off - diagonal spectrum .",
    "now we analyze the physical meaning of the difference .    from appendix a.1 ,",
    "the linear redshift distortion of spectrum @xmath59 is determined by the factor @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is a geometric factor given by eq.(a4 ) .",
    "the linear redshift distortion is significant on large scale .",
    "moreover , the geometric factor satisfies @xmath233 therefore the spectrum @xmath229 is less affected by the linear redshift distortion than @xmath234 . thus , if fitting both @xmath234 and @xmath229 with the _ same _ fitting formula eq.(31 ) , the best - fitting @xmath3 for @xmath229 will be lower than those of @xmath234 .",
    "table 1 shows the systematic lowering of @xmath235 than @xmath236 .",
    "the effect of galaxy pairwise velocity on spectrum @xmath59 is determined by the power @xmath237 ( appendix a.2 ) .",
    "if the power of pairwise velocity is approximately scale - independent , we have @xmath238 that is , the spectrum @xmath229 is strongly affected by the random velocity field than @xmath234 .",
    "thus , if fitting both @xmath234 and @xmath229 with the same fitting formula eq.(31 ) , the best - fitting @xmath4 for @xmath229 will be larger than those of @xmath234 .",
    "this is shown in table 1 .",
    "the significant difference between the best - fitting results of @xmath234 and @xmath229 shows that the off - diagonal power spectrum has the capability of measuring the galaxy velocity field from the observational data .",
    "the dwt power spectrum estimator is studied with the galaxy distributions of the las campanas redshift survey , and the relevant mock and simulation samples in models of the scdm , @xmath99cdm and @xmath5cdm .",
    "the dwt estimator for 3-d samples provide two types of spectra with respect to diagonal and off - diagonal modes , respectively .",
    "the two types of the dwt local modes have different configuration and invariance , and therefore , the diagonal and off - diagonal dwt power spectra are flexible for studying direction - dependent properties .    using mock and simulation samples , we studied the effect of the irregular geometry of the survey , the inhomogeneity caused by the selection function , the scale - dependence of the redshift distortion due to the random velocity field of galaxies etc . to estimate the uncertainty and errors caused by these effects , the localization of the dwt modes in phase space are essential .",
    "for instance , the off - diagonal power spectra are capable of measuring the statistical features of the random velocity field of galaxies on mode @xmath38 , because the dwt power on mode @xmath38 is mainly affected by the power of the velocity fluctuations on mode @xmath38 .",
    "the dwt power spectrum from the six slices of the lcrs galaxies are very stable over the scale range @xmath239h mpc@xmath2 , in spite of the fact that the filling factor of the lcrs galaxies is only about 0.9% ( in comparison , sdss s filling factor is about 17% . ) to fit the lcrs dwt power spectrum with cdm models , we find that the redshift distortion parameter @xmath3 and the 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath4 are consistent with results of the fourier power spectrum . therefore , the dwt estimator can give a robust measurement of the banded fourier power spectrum .",
    "more interesting , the differences between the best - fitting parameters of lcrs diagonal and off - diagonal dwt power spectra are found to be significant .",
    "this shows that the redshift space behaviors of the diagonal and off - diagonal dwt power spectra are different . with the diagonal and off - diagonal dwt power spectra , we would be able to compare the pairwise velocity dispersion on different modes",
    ". therefore , the difference between diagonal and off - diagonal power spectra would be valuable to constrain models .",

    "we thank anonymous referee for helpful comments .",
    "if the density field is viewed in redshift space , the observed radial position is given by the radial velocity consisting of the uniform hubble flow and the peculiar motion @xmath182 .",
    "in the linear regime of clustering , the effect of redshift distortion can be described by a linear mapping from density contrast @xmath26 in real space to redshift space @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the linear redshift distortion operator . in plane - parallel approximation , it is @xmath242 where @xmath3 is the redshift distortion parameter , and @xmath9 is on the direction of redshift .",
    "the differential operator in eq.(a2 ) is quasi - diagonal when decomposed into the dwt basis ( farge et al .",
