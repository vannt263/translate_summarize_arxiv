    "here , the inverted cheerios effect is observed with sub - millimeter drops of ethylene glycol on a pdms gel .",
    "the gel is a reticulated polymer formed by polymerizing small multifunctional prepolymers ",
    "contrary to hydrogels , there is no liquid phase trapped inside .",
    "the low shear modulus of the pdms gel gives an elasto - capillary length @xmath2 sufficiently large to be measurable in the optical domain .",
    "the interaction between two neighboring liquid drops is quantified by tracking their positions while they are sliding under the effect of gravity along a soft layer held vertically .",

    "[ fig1 ]  c , we report @xmath3 as a function of the separation @xmath5 , defined as the shortest distance between the surfaces of the drops . the drops ( @xmath6 ) exhibit attraction when sliding down a thick layer ( @xmath7 , black curve ) , while they are repelled on a thin layer ( @xmath8 , red curve ) .",
    "@xmath3 is larger at close proximity , signaling an increase in the interaction force .",
    "spontaneous merging occurs where drops encounter direct contact .",
    "importantly , these interactions provide a new mechanism for droplet coarsening ( or ordering ) by coalescence ( or its suppression ) that has no counterpart on rigid surfaces .",
    "the interaction force @xmath9 can be inferred from the relative velocities between the drops , based on the effective  drag \" due to sliding on a gel .",
    "we first calibrate this drag by considering drops that are sufficiently separated , so that they do not experience any mutual interaction .",
    "the motion is purely downward and driven only by gravitational force @xmath10 , and inertia is negligible .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ]  d shows that the droplet velocity @xmath11 is nonlinear , and approximately scales as @xmath12 .",
    "this force - velocity calibration curve is in good agreement with viscoelastic dissipation in the gel , based on which one expects the scaling law  @xcite : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the rheological exponent that emerges from the scale invariance of the gel network @xcite , while @xmath15 is a characteristic timescale . the parameter values @xmath16 and @xmath17 are calibrated in a rheometer ( see methods ) .",
    "equation is valid for @xmath18 below the characteristic rheological speed , @xmath19  this is justified here since @xmath20 for the silicone gel , while the reported speeds reach up to @xmath21 .",
    "the presence of a large viscoelastic dissipation in the gel exceeds the dissipation within the drop by orders of magnitude , and explains these extremely slow drop velocities observed experimentally  @xcite . the force - distance relation for the inverse cheerios effect",

    "figure  [ fig2 ]  b shows the interaction force between drops on thin layers .",
    "the dominant interaction is now repulsive ( @xmath32 ) , see supplementary video 2 .",
    "intriguingly , we find that the interaction is not purely repulsive , but also displays an attractive range at very small distance .",
    "it is possible to access this range experimentally in case the motion of the individual drops are sufficiently closely aligned ( supplementary video 3 ) .",
    "the  neutral \" distance where the interaction force changes sign appears when the separation is comparable to the substrate thickness @xmath33 , suggesting that the key parameter governing whether the drops attract or repel is the thickness of the gel .",
    "we explain the attraction versus repulsion of neighboring drops by computing the total free energy of drops on gel layers of different thicknesses .",
    "in contrast to the normal cheerios effect , which involves two rigid particles , in the current experiment an additional element of complexity is present : both the droplet and the elastic substrate are deformable , and their shapes will change upon varying the distance @xmath5 . hence , the interaction force involves both the elastic and the surface tension contributions to the free energy that emerge from self - consistently computed shapes of the drops and elastic deformations",

    "the free energy is minimized under the constraint that the nearest contact lines are separated by a distance @xmath5 .",
    "this constraint is imposed by adding the term @xmath43 to the free energy , where @xmath44 is the inner contact line position ( see supplementary information ) . with this convention",
    "attractive forces correspond to @xmath45 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath46 is the external force necessary to prevent the drop from moving towards each other , yielding an external work @xmath47 when varying the spacing between the drops .",
    "the energy minimization reveals the mechanism of drop - drop interaction : the interaction force @xmath42 appears in the boundary condition for the contact angles , @xmath48 where the angles are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ] .",
    "equation can be thought of as an  imbalance \" of the usual neumann boundary condition . for a single droplet ,",
    "the contact angles satisfy neumann s law , which is with @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ]  a ) . on a thick elastic layer ,",
    "the overall shape of the wetting ridge is of the form @xcite @xmath50 where the horizontal scale is set by elasto - capillary length based on the typical solid surface tension @xmath51 .",
    "the origin of @xmath42 can be understood from the principle of superposition . due to the substrate deformation of a single drop ,",
    "a second drop approaching the first one will see a surface that is locally rotated by an angle @xmath52 .",
    "the elastic meniscus near the inner contact line of this approaching drop gets rotated by an angle @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ]  b ) .",
    "importantly , changes in the liquid angle @xmath53 exhibit a weaker dependence @xmath54 , which for large drops can be ignored . as a consequence",
    ", this meniscus rotation induces an imbalance of the surface tension forces according to , which for small rotations yields @xmath55 , where @xmath34 follows from the single drop deformation .",
    "there is no resultant interaction force from the stress below the drop , which , due to deformability of the drop , provides a uniform pressure .",
    "the inverted cheerios effect is therefore substantially different from the cheerios effect between two particles floating at the surface of a liquid .",
    "apart from the drop being deformable , we note that the energy driving the interaction is different for the two cases : while the liquid interface shape is determined by the balance between gravity and surface tension in the cheerios effect , the solid shape is determined by elasto - capillarity in the inverted cheerios effect .",
    "another difference is the mechanism by which the interaction is mediated .",
    "the cheerios effect is primarily driven by a change in gravitational potential energy which implies a vertical displacement of particles : a heavy particle slides downwards , like a bead on a string , along the deformation created by a neighboring particle @xcite .",
    "a similar interaction was recently discussed for rigid cylinders that deform an elastic surface due to gravity @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the inverted cheerios effect discussed here does not involve gravity and can be totally ascribed to elasto - capillary tilting of the solid interfaces  as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ]  manifesting the interaction as a force near the contact line .",
    "the rotation of contact angles indeed explains why the drop - drop interaction can be either attractive or repulsive . on a thick substrate , the second drop experiences solid contact angles that are rotated counter clockwise , inducing an attractive force ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ]  b ) . by contrast , on a thin substrate the elastic deformation induced by the second drop has a non - monotonic profile @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to volume conservation : the lifting of the gel near the contact line creates a depression at larger distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism ]  c ) . at large distance",
    ", the rotation of the contact angles thus changes sign , and , accordingly , the interaction force changes from attractive to repulsive .",
    "naturally , the relevant length scale for this phenomenon is set by the layer thickness @xmath33 .",
    "the extension of the theory to three dimensions is straightforward and allows for a quantitative comparison with the experiments . for the three dimensional case",
    "we compute the shape of the solid numerically , by first numerically solving for the deformation field induced by a single using an axisymmetric elastic green function @xcite . adding a second drop on this deformed surface gives an intricate deformation that is shown in fig .",
    "the imbalance of the neumann law applies everywhere around the contact line : the background deformation induces a rotation of the solid contact angles around the drop . according to",
    ", these rotations result into a distribution of force per unit length contact line @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the radial direction associated with the interacting drop and @xmath58 the azimuthal angle along the contact line ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the resultant interaction force @xmath59 is obtained by integration along the contact line , as @xmath60 ( see supplementary information ) . by symmetry , this force is oriented along the line connecting the two drops .     is obtained by integration of the horizontal force @xmath35 ( indicated in red ) related to the imbalance of the neumann law around the contact line .",
    "parameter values are set to @xmath61 , @xmath62 . ]",
    "the interaction force obtained by the three - dimensional theory is shown as the red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ab .",
    "the theory gives an excellent description of the experimental data without adjustable parameters .",
    "the quantitative agreement indicates that the interaction mechanism is indeed caused by the rotation of the elastic meniscus .",
    "in summary , we have shown that liquid drops can exhibit a mutual interaction when deposited on soft surfaces .",
    "the interaction is mediated by substrate deformations , and its direction ( repulsive versus attractive ) can be tuned by the thickness of the layer .",
    "the measured force / distance relation is in quantitative agreement with the proposed elasto - capillary theory .",
    "the current study reveals that multiple `` pinchings '' of an elastic layer by localized tractions @xmath0 lead to an interaction having a range comparable to @xmath63 .",
    "the key insight is that interaction emerges from the rotation of the elastic surface , providing a generic mechanism that should be applicable to a wide range of objects interacting on soft media .    in biological settings",
    ", elasto - capillary interactions may play a role in cell - cell interactions , which are known to be sensitive to substrate stiffness @xcite .",
    "in addition , the elastic interaction could also play a role in cell - extracellular matrix interactions , as a purely passive force promoting aggregation between anchor points on the surface of adhered biological cells .",
    "for example , it has been demonstrated that a characteristic distance of about @xmath64  nm between topographical features enables the clustering of integrins .",
    "these transmembrane proteins are responsible for cell adhesion to the surrounding matrix , mediating the formation of strong anchor points when cells adhere to substrates @xcite . assuming that the topographical features `` pinch '' the cell with a force likely comparable to the cell s cortical tension , which takes values in the range @xmath65 @xcite , and an elastic modulus of @xmath66 in the physiological range of biological tissues @xcite , one predicts a range of interaction consistent with observations .",
    "more generally , substrate - mediated interactions could be dynamically programmed using the responsiveness of many gels to external stimuli ( ph , temperature , electric fields ) .",
    "possible applications range from fog harvesting and cooling to self - cleaning or anti - fouling surfaces , which rely on controlling drop migration and coalescence .",
    "the physical mechanisms revealed here , in combination with the fully quantitative elasto - capillary theory , paves the way for new design strategies for smart soft surfaces .",
