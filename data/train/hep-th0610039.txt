    "coset spaces are widely used in a variety of contexts , for example as target spaces within string theory or more generally within non - linear sigma models . for supersymmetric theories of this kind ,",
    "a thorough understanding of the geometry of super coset spaces is therefore essential . on the other hand , supersymmetric theories with coset spaces as the base",
    "naturally have a superspace formulation in terms of super coset spaces , the most prominent examples being supersymmetric theories in flat space .",
    "these can be formulated in terms of flat superspace , which is the quotient of the super poincar group by its lorentz subgroup .",
    "we aim to provide in this paper a firm mathematical basis for the geometry of super coset spaces , collating and making rigorous results often only sketched in the literature and extending results only discussed for ordinary coset spaces to the supersymmetric case .",
    "the geometry of a ( super ) coset space @xmath0 , i.e.  its frame and connection , can be determined in terms of the geometry of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , it is well known that by pulling back the maurer - cartan one - form on the group @xmath1 to the base @xmath0 one can obtain the frame and connection on the base , see e.g.  @xcite . while this is often stated in the literature a geometric explanation of this",
    "is usually omitted . treating the super lie group @xmath1 as a principal bundle over @xmath0",
    "we give a self - contained account of the geometry of coset spaces focussing in particular on the relation between the geometry in the bundle and the geometry in the base .",
    "coset spaces are characterized by high symmetry ; most of their isometries can be derived from the left action of @xmath1 on the coset space and as such the isometry group of @xmath0 contains @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the isometries of the coset space can be determined directly from its geometry : in the case of ordinary space the infinitesimal isometries , i.e.  the killing vector fields , are defined as the directions along which the metric tensor is dragged into itself . in the case of superspace  where the tangent space group of the supermanifold under consideration must correspond to the even grassmann extension of the tangent space group of the body of the supermanifold , i.e.  to @xmath2  such a definition is no longer feasible .",
    "this is as , in this case , there exists no physically natural superspace generalization of the concept of metric @xcite : if one were to introduce a supermetric the tangent space group of the supermanifold derived from this would be too large , and hence would not correspond to the even grassmann extension of @xmath2 , thus rendering the theory unphysical . while this problem is often noted in the literature its relevance to the definition of killing supervectors is seldom elucidated .",
    "one aim of this paper is therefore to make rigorous and clarify the notion of killing supervector fields in the context of superspace . as we shall see it is possible to define killing supervector fields as those infinitesimal transformations that leave the frame and connection invariant up to a gauge transformation , see",
    "also @xcite .",
    "this condition can be rephrased in terms of the commutator of some generalized lie derivative and the covariant derivative , cf .",
    "@xcite . in the case of super coset spaces",
    "we shall see that this definition reproduces the killing supervectors derived from the left action of the group on the super coset space which justifies this definition also for more general spaces .",
    "derivations such as the covariant derivative and generalized lie derivative are an integral part of the geometry of coset spaces .",
    "we give a geometric interpretation to derivations such as these on @xmath0 by defining them in terms of maps on the bundle @xmath1 and associated bundles .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : first we briefly review the construction of @xmath1 as a principal bundle over the coset space @xmath0 .",
    "we then discuss the geometry of @xmath1 focussing in particular on its invariant vector fields and the maurer - cartan form in the bundle . in sections",
    "[ sec : connection][sec : curvature ] we discuss in detail how the geometry in the base , i.e.  connection and frame , torsion and curvature , can be obtained from the geometry in the bundle . in section [ sec : bundle ] we introduce associated bundles and briefly review some aspects of supertensor bundles that will be important when discussing derivations on associated bundles .",
    "we then introduce those ( local ) bundle maps that will allow us to define in section [ sec : derivations ] derivations on supertensor bundles , such as the covariant derivative , the lie derivative and the so - called @xmath3-covariant lie derivative . as we shall see in section [ sec : killing ] , killing supervectors , i.e.  the supervectors associated to infinitesimal isometries , can be defined in terms of a so - called generalized lie derivative which combines an arbitrary transformation in the base with an arbitrary gauge transformation in the bundle , and which we require to commute with the covariant derivative .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : example ] , we shall apply the concepts and methods introduced in the previous sections to flat superspace as an example .",
    "consider a super lie group @xmath1 with super lie subgroup @xmath3 .",
    "a super lie group shall be defined in the sense of dewitt , see @xcite , as a group which is also a supermanifold and which has a differentiable group multiplication .",
    "we define the super coset space @xmath0 via the equivalence of group elements in @xmath1 under right multiplication by an element of @xmath3 , @xmath4 the coset space @xmath0 naturally inherits a supermanifold structure from the supermanifold @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the coset space @xmath0 is also inherited from @xmath1 . to study this we consider @xmath1 as a principal bundle over @xmath0 with fibre @xmath3 .",
    "the construction in the non - supersymmetric case @xcite is directly transferred to the supersymmetric case .",
    "first we have the bundle projection map @xmath5 the inverse image @xmath6 of a point @xmath7 in the base gives us the fibre above that point which is clearly isomorphic to @xmath3 . to define the local trivializations of the bundle we consider charts @xmath8 on the base .",
    "within a particular chart it is always possible to choose a local section . by a local section we mean a map @xmath9 which satisfies @xmath10 .",
    "the local section @xmath11 provides us with a coset representative @xmath12 for any @xmath13 . using this local section we define the canonical local trivialization for the bundle @xmath14 note that the inverse is easily constructed as @xmath15 .",
    "the transition functions for @xmath16 are defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the map @xmath19 is clearly just left multiplication by an element of @xmath3 , and we shall use the notation @xmath20 .",
    "the trivializations are then related as @xmath21 the structure group is therefore @xmath3 and acts on the fibre @xmath3 by left multiplication .",
    "we thus have that @xmath1 is a principal bundle over @xmath0 with structure group @xmath3 .",
    "we denote this as @xmath22 .",
    "let us denote the super lie algebra associated to the super lie group @xmath1 by @xmath23 .",
    "the generators of @xmath23 will be denoted by @xmath24 , @xmath25 ; they have definite parity , either even or odd and we will set @xmath26 for @xmath24 even and @xmath27 for @xmath24 odd .",
    "the index in the exponent of @xmath28 is as such to be understood as taking the values @xmath29 or @xmath30 according to whether it is even or odd .",
    "a general element of the super lie algebra is then expanded in the generators as @xmath31 , where the @xmath32 are pure supernumbers chosen such that @xmath33 is even .",
    "as such the super lie algebra consists of even elements only , in fact @xmath23 can be viewed as the even part of a larger berezin superalgebra @xcite .",
    "the super lie group @xmath1 can then be obtained from its super lie algebra via the exponential mapping .    for each element of the algebra @xmath34 we can construct two different supervector fields , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , defined by their action on a function @xmath37 on @xmath1 as    @xmath38&{\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}}\\left(f\\left(ge^{ta}\\right)\\right)\\big|_{t=0}\\\\ \\label{eqn : flat}a^\\flat\\big|_g[f]&{\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}}\\left(f\\left(e^{ta}g\\right)\\right)\\big|_{t=0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we have thus obtained two maps from the algebra @xmath23 to the space of vector fields on @xmath1 given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "clearly these maps are linear .",
    "the definition of the vector fields given above may be modified in the case that @xmath41 is an odd element of the berezin superalgebra simply by choosing the parameter @xmath42 to be an odd supernumber .",
    "this ensures that @xmath43 is still a group element .",
    "this way it possible to define the supervectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 for all @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath35 is a left - invariant vector field , whereas @xmath36 is right - invariant :    @xmath46    here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the group operations of left and right multiplication by @xmath49 , the lowered asterisk ( @xmath50 ) is used to denote the corresponding induced map on vector fields ( the pushforward ) .",
    "the vector fields also satisfy    @xmath51    here @xmath52 is the adjoint action of the group on its algebra which is induced from the adjoint action of the group on itself . for the latter we also use the notation @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath55&=[a , b]^\\sharp\\\\ \\label{eqn : flatalgebra } [ a^\\flat , b^\\flat]&=-[a , b]^\\flat\\\\ [ a^\\sharp , b^\\flat]&=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the bracket occurring on the right is the super lie algebra bracket .",

    "we will occasionally work in a matrix representation where it is more convenient .",
    "in this section we will construct a connection on the coset space @xmath0 .",
    "we will see that this connection is naturally induced from the group @xmath1 , in particular from the maurer - cartan form .",
    "a connection on a fibre bundle is defined quite abstractly in terms of a decomposition of the tangent space into so - called vertical and horizontal subspaces . while this definition may not be the definition of connection familiar from physics it will provide us with a deeper insight into the geometry . in section [ sec : localcon ] we will review how this abstract definition relates to the familiar notion of connection in physics .",
    "geometrically a connection on the bundle @xmath1 can be thought of as a decomposition of the tangent space to the super lie group , @xmath61 , into vertical and horizontal subspaces , respectively .",

    "in the previous section we have discussed how the connection one - form on the bundle @xmath1 can be taken to be the vertical part of the maurer - cartan one - form .",

    "so let us expand @xmath145 in the basis of the @xmath151 as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 are therefore arbitrary supernumbers of parity @xmath41 since @xmath145 is even .",
