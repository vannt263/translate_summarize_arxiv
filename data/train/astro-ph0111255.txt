    "the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) is a long - term planet detection program which aims to perform extra - solar planet detection and measurement at the highest possible precision .",
    "together with programmes using similar techniques on the lick 3 m and keck i 10 m telescopes @xcite , it provides all - sky planet search coverage for inactive f , g , k and m dwarfs down to a magnitude limit of v=7.5 .",
    "initial results from this programme demonstrate that aaps acheives long - term , systematic velocity precisions of 3ms@xmath1  or better @xcite .",
    "aaps is being carried out on the 3.92 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , using the university college of london echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) and an i@xmath2 absorption cell .",
    "ucles is operated in its 31linesmm@xmath1 mode . prior to 2001",
    "september , it was used with a mit / ll 2048@xmath34096 15@xmath4 m pixel ccd , and since then has been used with an eev 2048@xmath34096 13.5@xmath4 m pixel ccd .",
    "our target sample includes 178 fgk stars with @xmath5  and v@xmath67.5 , and a further 23 m and metal enriched stars with v@xmath611.5 . where age / activity information is available from r@xmath7  indices ( see e.g. , @xcite ) we require target stars to have r@xmath7@xmath6 @xmath8 ( corresponding to ages greater than 3gyr ) .",
    "the observing and data processing procedure follows that described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hd142 ( hr6 , hip522 , gj4.2a , lhs1020 ) is a chromospherically inactive ( r@xmath7=@xmath9 ) g1iv star @xcite .",
    "its hipparcos parallax of 39.0@xmath100.6mas implies absolute magnitudes of m@xmath11=3.66@xmath100.03 @xcite and m@xmath12=5.55@xmath100.05 @xcite .",
    "the fundamental parameters of hd142 have been examined via spectroscopy @xcite and strmgren @xmath13 photometry ( see the compilation of @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopy derives [ fe / h]=@xmath14 and t@xmath15=6025k , while the photometry suggests [ fe / h]=@xmath16 , which is in agreement with the spectroscopy to within uncertainties .",
    "based on interpolation between the evolutionary tracks of @xcite , the mass of hd142 is estimated to be 1.15@xmath100.1m@xmath17 .",
    "figure [ ca_line ] shows the h line region for hd142 , together with the quiet sun and hd23079 .",
    "the absence of significant emission confirms that this star is chromospherically inactive .",
    "hd23079 ( hip17096 , ltt1739 ) is an inactive dwarf with a r@xmath7=@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "@xcite classify it as f8/g0v ( i.e. intermediate between f8 and g0 ) .",
    "its hipparcos parallax is 28.9@xmath100.6mas , giving it m@xmath11=4.42@xmath100.05 and m@xmath12=4.25@xmath100.05 @xcite .",
    "no metallicity information is available for this star , so mass estimation will be less precise . at [ fe / h]=+0.25 , 0.0 and @xmath19 , the models of @xcite would indicate m=1.25 , 1.10 and 1.0m@xmath17  ( respectively ) .",
    "for the most likely metallicity range of this f / g - dwarf , its mass lies in the range 1.0 - 1.25m@xmath17 , and we therefore adopt m=1.10@xmath100.15m@xmath17 . both hd142 and hd23079 were seen to be photometrically stable over the life of the hipparcos mission at a 95% confidence level of @xmath60.018 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "twenty - seven observations of hd142 are listed in table [ vel142 ] .",
    "the column labelled `` uncertainty '' is the velocity uncertainty produced by our least - squares fitting .",
    "this fit simultaneously determines the doppler shift and the spectrograph point - spread function ( psf ) for each observation made though the iodine cell , given an iodine absorption spectrum and an `` iodine free '' template spectrum of the object @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty is derived from the ensemble of velocities from each of four hundred useful spectral regions ( each 2  long ) in every exposure .",
    "this uncertainty includes the effects of photon - counting uncertainties , residual errors in the spectrograph psf model , and variation in the underlying spectrum between the template and `` iodine '' epochs .",
    "all velocities are measured relative to the zero - point defined by the template observation . only observations where the uncertainty is less than twice the median uncertainty are listed .",
    "these data are shown in figure [ hd142_rv_curve ] .",
    "the figure shows the best - fit keplerian model for the data , with the resultant orbital parameters listed in table [ orbits ] .",
    "the residuals about the fit are slightly higher than the 3 - 4ms@xmath1  average level of `` jitter '' expected in a g1 star with hd142 s level of activity @xcite , but is within the typical range seen in even inactive stars .",
    "the thirteen observations of hd23079 are listed in table [ vel23079 ] , and they are shown in figure [ hd23079_rv_curve ] along with a keplerian fit to the data with the orbital parameters listed in table [ orbits ] .",
    "the rms scatter about this fit of only 3.08ms@xmath1  demonstrates the extra - ordinary control over long term systematics which the iodine cell technique can deliver for stars with suitable intrinsic velocity stability .",
    "it also demonstrates the suitability of the ucles spectograph at the aat for radial velocities at the highest precisions  even for a v=7.1 star near our v=7.5 current survey limit .",
    "the resultant minimum companion mass for hd142 is m@xmath20=1.03@xmath100.19m@xmath21 , with an orbital semi - major axis @xmath22=1.0@xmath100.1au   at an eccentricity of @xmath23=0.37@xmath100.1  a roughly jupiter - mass giant planet in an earth - like , but eccentric , orbit .",
    "an interesting feature of hd142 is that its metallicity is only marginally enriched over solar .",
    "this planet , at least , has not formed in a metal - enriched system , as has been suggested for many of the extra - solar planets ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the minimum companion mass and orbital parameters derived for hd23079 ( m@xmath20=2.5@xmath101.1m@xmath21 , @xmath22=1.5@xmath100.2au , @xmath23=0.04@xmath100.18 ) indicate the presence of a planet with significantly larger mass than jupiter , in a mars - like orbit with eccentricity consistent with zero . together with the extra - solar planetary companions to @xmath0ret @xcite , hd4208 @xcite , 47umab&c @xcite , and possibly the companions to hd114783 and hd10697 @xcite , hd23079 forms a new class of extra - solar planets , which we name after the prototype object @xmath0ret .",
    "the region of the log(@xmath23 ) versus log(@xmath24 ) diagram these `` @xmath0ret - like '' planets occupy is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ eversusa ] .",
    "it is worth remembering that prior to about 12 months ago the highlighted region of this plot was empty ",
    "though many extra - solar planets had been discovered , none shared orbital properties with the planets of our own solar system . the `` @xmath0ret - like '' planets , therefore , join with the `` 51peg - like '' and eccentric giant planets in filling out the bestiary of extra - solar planets . prior to their detection , it was unclear whether giant planets in circular , or near - circular , orbits outside 0.1a.u",
    ". would be found _ at all _ outside the solar system .",
    "their discovery points the way to the detection of solar system analogs ( in the form of jupiter - like - planets in jupiter - like - orbits ) once data sequences at better than 2 - 3ms@xmath1  span the necessary 10 - 12 year periods .",
    "we present results for the detection and characterisation for two new extra - solar planets with orbital periods of one year or greater around the stars hd142 and hd23079 .",
    "the planet around hd23079 is particularly interesting  it represents the detection of a new member of the class of `` @xmath0ret - like '' giant planets in near - circular orbits outside 0.1a.u .. the continued detection by high precision doppler searches of these gas giants , in solar system - like orbits , gives added impetus that the continuation of these searches to the 10 - 12 year periods where analogs of the gas giants in our own solar system may become detectable around other stars .",
    "the anglo - australian planet search team would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of dr brian boyle , director of the aao , and the superb technical support which has been received throughout the programme from aat staff - in particular e.penny , r.patterson , d.stafford , f.freeman , s.lee , j.pogson and g.schafer .",
