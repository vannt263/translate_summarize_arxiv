    "the phase of an electromagnetic field is not a quantity that can be directly measured .",
    "all phase - measurement schemes rely on measurement of some other quantity , which necessarily introduces an excess uncertainty in the phase estimate .",
    "the standard method of measuring the phase of a single mode is to combine it with a strong local - oscillator field , which is detuned from the signal ( so the phase changes linearly with respect to the signal phase ) .",
    "this is called the heterodyne scheme , and introduces an excess uncertainty scaling as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mean photon number .",
    "if the signal phase is known approximately beforehand , the introduced phase uncertainty can be reduced greatly by using a local - oscillator phase that is @xmath12 out of phase with the signal ( homodyne measurements ) .",
    "if there is no estimate for the phase available beforehand , it is still possible to reduce the excess phase uncertainty by adjusting the local - oscillator phase during the measurement so as to approximate a homodyne measurement @xcite . the mark ii dyne measurements considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite introduce an excess phase uncertainty scaling as @xmath13 .",
    "it is even possible to attain the theoretical limit , scaling as @xmath14 , using a more sophisticated feedback scheme @xcite .",
    "the case of interferometry is quite similar . in interferometry",
    "we wish to measure the phase shift in one arm of an interferometer by counting photons in the output ports .",
    "if a phase shift varying linearly in time is introduced into the other arm ( analogous to the heterodyne case ) , there is a large introduced phase variance scaling as @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "if feedback is used to adjust the auxiliary phase shift adaptively , the introduced phase variance is greatly reduced @xcite .",
    "these studies are all based on single - shot measurements , where the measurements are made on a single ( one- or two - mode ) pulse with finite duration and a single fixed phase . in practice , if we wish to transmit information via a beam , a time - varying phase would be more convenient .",
    "a time - varying phase may also arise through random fluctuations , and we may wish to keep track of the phase as well as possible .",
    "it is also possible to model a broadband signal that carries information by random fluctuations .",
    "we therefore consider the case of a phase subject to white noise in this paper .",
    "we consider cw measurements for both dyne measurements and interferometry .",
    "for the former , we consider both coherent beams and broadband squeezed beams . for interferometry",
    "it is not clear if there is a cw analog to the optimal two - mode states derived in refs .",
    "therefore , we consider only the case of a coherent input into one port .",
    "first , we will consider the case of cw dyne measurements on a single beam with a varying phase .",
    "it is simplest to consider a coherent beam with amplitude @xmath16 $ ] having a constant magnitude , but varying phase .",
    "the magnitude is scaled so that @xmath17 is the photon flux ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "as explained above , the phase is assumed to diffuse in time , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is a wiener increment satisfying @xmath21 .",
    "the spectrum for the coherent beam is a lorentzian of linewidth ( full width at half maximum ) @xmath22 .    as in the single - shot case ,",
    "a quadrature of the field is measured by combining the mode to be measured with a large - amplitude local - oscillator field at a 50:50 beam splitter and measuring the outputs with photodetectors .",
    "the photocurrent is then defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the outputs from the photodetectors and @xmath26 is the local - oscillator amplitude . for a continuous coherent beam",
    "this yields @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the phase of the local oscillator , and @xmath29 is a wiener increment independent of @xmath30 .    in making adaptive phase measurements the phase of the local oscillator is usually taken to be @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is some estimate of the system phase @xmath33 @xcite . with this , the signal becomes @xmath34 dt + dw(t).\\ ] ]      provided that the estimated system phase is sufficiently close to the actual system phase , we can make the linear approximation @xmath35dt +   dw(t).\\ ] ] rearranging this equation , we see that @xmath36 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath33 based on the data obtained in the infinitesimal time interval @xmath37",

    "this is because we are using the linear approximation .",
    "the noise in the estimate @xmath41 is due entirely to the photocurrent noise , rather than the noise in the phase @xmath44 itself .",
    "since @xmath29 is independent of all previous noise , the updated best estimate @xmath45 will be a weighted average of the instantaneous phase estimate @xmath41 and the estimate from all the previous data @xmath39 .",

    "explicitly , the weighted average is @xmath56 solving this as a differential equation gives @xmath57 therefore , this method corresponds to a simple negative exponential scaling of the weighting .",
    "we can also consider a more general negative exponential scaling given by @xmath58 note that with this more general scaling , @xmath39 is no longer necessarily the best phase estimate .",
    "for most of the remainder of this paper , @xmath39 will be used in this more general sense , rather than as specifically the best phase estimate .",
    "the best phase estimate will be found by finding the optimum value of @xmath59 .",
    "taking the derivative of this expression with respect to time gives @xmath60 this means that this method is again a weighted average , except with a weighting that is not optimum .",
    "if we find the variance of both sides of this equation and solve for @xmath46 we obtain @xmath61 this equation has a minimum of @xmath62 for @xmath63 , reproducing the result found more directly above .",
    "the results of the previous section are all using the linear approximation ( [ linearapprox ] ) .",
    "although this approximation is very useful for obtaining the asymptotic value of the variance , it does not directly tell us what to do in the exact case . in the exact case for single - shot measurements @xcite , rather than averaging phase estimates from each time interval , we determine @xmath64 and @xmath65 , defined ( for scaled time @xmath66 $ ] ) as @xmath67 and obtain the phase estimate from @xmath68 the intermediate phase estimate in the simplest ( mark ii ) case @xcite was @xmath69    we seek cw analogues of these formulas , that should reproduce the above linearized results in the appropriate ( large @xmath9 ) regime . guided by sec .",

    "note that from this derivation it naturally emerges that we should use the same exponential in the integrand for @xmath77 as for @xmath78 . from eq .",
    "( [ expanda ] ) it can be shown that @xmath79 taking the expectation value gives @xmath80 if the local oscillator phase is independent of the photocurrent record , then this is exact . in the case of feedback",

    "the probability distribution for the time between detections is given by the exponential distribution @xmath214 in the results that will be presented here , the time between detections , @xmath215 , was determined according to this probability distribution .    now in order to determine the effect of this phase diffusion on the probability distribution between detections , we must first consider the effect over some very small time interval @xmath216 .",
    "this is necessary because the probability distribution for the change in the system phase over time @xmath215 does not go to zero for @xmath217 .",
    "this means that the probability distribution will not be exactly gaussian , due to the overlap .",
    "in contrast , if we look at a very small time interval @xmath216 , the change in the phase will have a normal distribution with a variance of @xmath218 .",
    "explicitly the probability distribution is @xmath219    the probability distribution for the phase after time @xmath216 will be the convolution of the initial probability distribution with the gaussian described by eq .",

    "the effect of the variation of the system phase on the probability distribution is , therefore , @xmath223    in order to take account of the effect of the phase diffusion on the probability distribution over some significant time interval @xmath224 , this time interval can be thought of as comprising @xmath225 small time intervals @xmath216 .",
    "then we find that the coefficients are just multiplied by @xmath225 terms of @xmath226 .",
    "this is equivalent to a single term of @xmath227 , which is very easy to implement .    as time passes the effect of eq .",

    "in addition we consider feedback that is equivalent to that considered in the single - shot case in ref .",
    "@xcite . rather than using an intermediate phase estimate as in the dyne case",
    ", we use the full power of bayesian statistics to choose the feedback phase @xmath164 so as to minimize the _ expected _ holevo phase variance after the _ next _ detection .",
    "this is achieved by choosing @xmath230 to minimize the value of @xcite @xmath231 the values of @xmath232 can be obtained , except for a normalizing constant that is common to @xmath233 and 1 , by using eq .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the phase uncertainty at equilibrium can be estimated using a similar approach as was used for the single - mode case .",
    "let us assume that the equilibrium variance in the best estimate for the system phase is @xmath46 .",
    "after time @xmath215 , the variance in this phase estimate with respect to the new system phase , @xmath238 , will be @xmath239 . in the equilibrium case",
    "this increase in the variance should , on average , be balanced by the decrease due to the next detection .",
    "we now wish to estimate the equilibrium variance based on a weighted average with the previous best phase estimate , and a phase estimate from the new detection .",
    "if we use the actual variance for a phase estimate based on a single detection , then we do not get accurate results .",
    "this is because the variance for a single detection is large , so the weighted average does not accurately correspond to the exact theory . in order to make the theory based on weighted averages accurate , we need to assume an _ effective _ variance for the single detection , that is different from the actual variance .    in the case where there is no variation in the system phase , the phase variance after @xmath240 detections is approximately @xmath241 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that , if we assume that each detection has an effective variance of 1 , then we will obtain the correct result .",
    "this is , in fact , equal to the variance as estimated using @xmath242 ( this measure is used , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . applying this to the case with a varying system phase gives @xmath243",
    "simplifying this to solve for @xmath46 , we find @xmath244 . on average ,",
    "the time between detections is @xmath245 , so the approximate value of the variance should be @xmath246",
    "in order to verify this theoretical result , the equilibrium phase variance was determined numerically for a variety of parameters . in this case",
    "there is only one dimensionless parameter , @xmath9 . in the case of dyne measurements",
    "there was the additional parameter @xmath118 describing how the latest results were weighted as compared to the previous results . in this case",
    "we do not have this parameter , as the phase estimates are not determined in that way .",
    "the calculations were run for @xmath247 detections ( or @xmath248 for the maximum value of @xmath9 ) , and the phase error was sampled every detection after @xmath249 detections .",
    "this was done 100 times for each value of @xmath9 .",
    "the equilibrium phase variance was determined in this way for the nearly optimum feedback scheme described above .",
    "in addition we tested a nonadaptive measurement scheme with @xmath250 where @xmath251 is a random initial phase .",
    "when the value of @xmath9 was 1 or less this was modified to @xmath252 to prevent @xmath253 being constant ( modulo @xmath182 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the nonadaptive scheme in the single - shot case used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is analogous to heterodyne measurement .",
    "the reason for the factor of @xmath254 is that the effective number of detections used for the phase estimate is @xmath255 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the phase variance is approximately @xmath256 .",
    "a minor problem with cw adaptive measurements is that the number of probability coefficients @xmath257 needed to determine the probability distribution for the phase rises indefinitely with the number of detections .",
    "the narrowing effect of the varying system phase , however , means that the probability coefficients fall approximately exponentially with @xmath228 .",
    "the probability distribution can , therefore , be approximated very accurately by keeping only a certain number of coefficients .",
    "for the results presented here all probability coefficients with a magnitude above about @xmath258 were used .    the holevo phase variances for the two measurement schemes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ runintlog ] .",
    "as can be seen , the results for both cases are very close to the theoretical result of @xmath256 for the larger values of @xmath9 . for values of @xmath9 closer to 1 the results for the nonadaptive scheme are noticeably above the theoretical values . for small values of @xmath9 ( less than 1 )",
    ", the variance converges to 3 for both the feedback schemes .",
    "this is what can be expected , as the system phase is randomized between detections .",
    "this means that the measurements are equivalent to phase measurements with a single photon , for which the holevo phase variance is 3 .",
    "the feedback has no effect , as there is no information on which to base it .    to see the differences more clearly ,",
    "the phase variances are plotted as ratios to the theoretical values in the inset of fig .",
    "[ runintlog ] .",
    "the adaptive scheme gives phase variances that are very close to , and slightly below , the theoretical values for moderate values of @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , the results for nonadaptive measurements are all above the theoretical values ( for @xmath259 ) . for small values of @xmath9",
    "the variance for both schemes is below @xmath256 , as the variance is converging to 3 .    .",
    "the numerical results for adaptive and nonadaptive measurements are shown as the crosses and pluses , respectively , and the theoretical values are shown as the continuous line . the inset shows the phase variance as a ratio to the theoretical value of @xmath254 .",
    "the results for adaptive and nonadaptive measurements are shown as the continuous line and dotted line , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    these results show that there will be a significant improvement in using an adaptive scheme over a nonadaptive scheme only if the time scale for the system phase variation is comparable to the time between detections .",
    "this can be expected from the results for the single - shot case with all photons in one port , where there was a significant improvement in using an adaptive scheme only if the photon number was small .",
    "the maximum improvement here is about 24% for @xmath260 .",
    "this study considered the problem of cw phase measurements , where the phase is being varied randomly in time and the aim is to follow this variation with the minimum possible excess uncertainty .",
    "we considered three different situations : dyne measurements on a coherent beam , dyne measurements on a ( broadband ) squeezed beam , and interferometric measurements using a coherent beam input .",
    "the relevant dimensionless parameter is @xmath9 , the number of photons per coherence time ( the characteristic time for the phase diffusion ) . under optimum conditions",
    ", we found the analytical results , confirmed numerically , shown in table [ table ] .",
    "previous results obtained for single - shot measurements on a pulse containing @xmath240 , or @xmath55 on average , photons are also shown for comparison .",
    "a number of regularities are evident from this table . with coherent light ,",
    "the variance reduction offered by adaptive measurements is at most a multiplying factor . with nonclassical light , nonadaptive measurements scale in the same way as for coherent light , but adaptive measurements offer an improvement in the scaling . in all cases ,",
    "the variance reduction ( by a change in the prefactor or the scaling ) is less in the cw case than in the pulsed case .",
    "this is because in order to obtain the best phase estimate , as @xmath9 increases , the memory time for the estimate is reduced .",
    "this is needed to keep the contribution to the variance from the varying system phase ( which increases with memory time ) comparable with that from the quantum uncertainty ( which decreases with memory time ) .",
    "this means that the effective number of photons used for the estimate is the number per memory time , rather than the number per coherence time , @xmath9 .    in the case of dyne measurements on a coherent beam",
    ", it was found that good results were obtained using a simple feedback phase ( @xmath71 ) , similarly to mark ii single - shot measurements @xcite . in the cw case",
    ", the feedback simplifies to a form even simpler than for the single - shot case . specifically , the feedback phase is simply adjusted proportional to the photocurrent .",
    "when the correct proportionality constant is selected , a minimum equilibrium phase variance is found that scales as @xmath261 .",
    "this is only @xmath6 times smaller than the phase variance for heterodyne measurements .    for the case of dyne measurements on broadband squeezed states",
    ", the situation is considerably more complicated .",
    "the change in the phase can not be taken to be proportional to the current , but rather is a functional with two parameters . with the degree of squeezing to be optimized as well",
    ", there are three parameters that must be varied to find the minimum phase variance .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to obtain an analytic result that agrees with the numerical results in its scaling ( although predicts the wrong multiplying factor ) .",
    "specifically , it was found that the minimum phase variance varies as @xmath7 , compared to @xmath8 for a coherent beam .",
    "this contrasts with heterodyne measurements on broadband squeezed states , for which the minimum variance is only about 7% below the corresponding result for a coherent beam .",
    "the case for interferometry is more difficult to treat , as it does not work with any simple feedback scheme .",
    "the feedback used was based on minimizing the expected variance after the next detection , similarly to the single - shot case . despite this",
    ", it was found that it is possible to determine an approximate theory that agrees reasonably well with the numerical results for the case where a coherent beam enters one port of the interferometer .",
    "similarly to the dyne case with a coherent state , the phase variance is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "when a linearly changing feedback phase was used ( analogous to the heterodyne scheme ) , it was found that the phase variance is above that for the adaptive feedback , but the difference is very small except for @xmath9 of order unity .",
    "this is as can be expected , as the difference is also very small for large photon numbers in the single - shot case .    in comparison with our previous pulsed results ,",
    "the cw results obtained in this paper are probably more relevant to , and in some cases easier to implement in , a quantum - optics laboratory .",
