    "in a vast range of applications , critical decisions depend on the output of complex computer simulation models , with examples including weather and climate predictions and the management of floods , wildfires , air quality , and groundwater contaminations .",
    "there is a strongly increased recognition of the need for quantifying the uncertainty in the model output , as evidenced by the creation of pertinent american statistical association ( asa ) and society for industrial and applied mathematics ( siam ) interest groups , and by the recent launch of the siam / asa journal on uncertainty quantification . as",
    "siam president nick @xcite notes succinctly ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` an answer that used to be a single number may now be a statistical distribution .

    "while our data examples all concern weather forecasting , where the recognition of the need for uncertainty quantification can be traced at least to @xcite , the methods and principles we discuss apply in much broader contexts , both predictive and in other settings , where one seeks to quantify the uncertainty in our incomplete knowledge of current or past quantities and events .    ]    ]    focusing attention on the setting of our case study , accurate predictions of future weather are invaluable for society .",
    "medium - range weather forecasts , with lead times up to two weeks , are obtained by numerically solving the partial differential equations that describe the physics of the atmosphere , with initial conditions provided by estimates of the current state of the atmosphere @xcite . in order to account for the uncertainties in the forecast , national and international meteorological centers use ensembles of numerical weather prediction ( nwp ) model output , where the ensemble members differ in terms of the two major sources of uncertainty , namely , the initial conditions and the parameterization of the nwp model @xcite . to give an example ,",
    "figures [ fig : ens.temp ] and [ fig : ens.precip ] illustrate forecasts of surface temperature and six - hour precipitation accumulation over germany issued by the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) as a part of its 50-member real - time ensemble , which operates at a horizontal resolution of approximately 32 km and lead times up to ten days .",
    "while the goal of nwp ensemble systems is to capture the inherent uncertainty in the prediction , they are subject to systematic errors , such as biases and dispersion errors .",
    "it is therefore common practice to statistically postprocess the output of nwp ensemble forecasts , with state of the art techniques including the ensemble bayesian model averaging ( bma ) approach developed by , and the non - homogeneous regression ( nr ) or ensemble model output statistics ( emos ) technique proposed by .",
    "to illustrate the idea , let @xmath0 denote the weather quantity of interest , such as temperature at a specific location and look - ahead time , and write @xmath1 for the corresponding @xmath2 ensemble member forecasts .",
    "the ensemble bma approach employs mixture distributions of the general form @xmath3 where the left - hand side refers to the conditional distribution given the ensemble member forecasts . here",
    "@xmath4 denotes a parametric probability distribution or kernel that depends on the ensemble member forecast @xmath5 in suitable ways , with the mixture weights @xmath6 reflecting the members relative contributions to predictive skill over a training period .",
    "bma postprocessed predictive distributions based on the 50-member ecmwf ensemble are illustrated in figure [ fig : pred.pdf.temp ] for temperature , where the kernel is normal , and in figure [ fig : pred.pdf.precip ] for precipitation , where the kernel comprises a point mass at zero along with a power transformed gamma distribution for positive accumulations .    ,",

    "for example , @xmath8 could be normal with the mean an affine function of the ensemble member forecasts and the variance an affine function of the ensemble variance .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=51.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    statistical postprocessing techniques such as ensemble bma and nr have been shown to substantially improve the predictive skill of the nwp ensemble output @xcite .",
    "frequently , they apply to each weather variable at each location and each lead time individually , and thus they may fail to take cross - variable , spatial and temporal interactions properly into account .",
    "nwp models rely on discretizations of the equations that govern the physics of the atmosphere and multivariate dependence structures thus tend to be reasonably well represented in the raw ensemble system",
    ". however , these structures may fail to be retained if the univariate margins are postprocessed individually . in low - dimensional or highly structured settings , parametric approaches to the modeling of multivariate dependence structures in the forecast errors",
    "are feasible , such as in the recent work of @xcite , and on wind vectors , or in the approach of and that relies on geostatistical models in spatial settings .",
    "however , the statistical postprocessing of a full nwp ensemble forecast poses extremely high dimensional problems .",
    "for instance , we might be interested in five weather variables at @xmath9 grid boxes , ten vertical levels and 72 lead times , a total of 900 million variables . while not all of them may need to be considered simultaneously , critical applications , such as air traffic control @xcite , air quality and flood management , depend on physically realistic probabilistic forecasts of spatio - temporal weather trajectories and therefore may entail much higher dimensions than",
    "can readily be incorporated into a parametric model .    to address this challenge , we propose and review a general multi - stage procedure called ensemble copula coupling ( ecc ) , originally hinted at by @xcite and @xcite , and recently investigated and developed by @xcite .",
    "the ecc approach allows for the multivariate rank dependence structure of the raw nwp ensemble to be preserved in the postprocessed ensemble , proceeding roughly as follows .",
    "+   +    univariate postprocessing : :    apply statistical postprocessing techniques , such as ensemble bma or    nr , to obtain calibrated and sharp marginal predictive distributions    for each weather variable , location and look - ahead time individually .",
    "quantization : :    draw a discrete sample of the same size as the raw ensemble from each    univariate , postprocessed predictive distribution .",
    "ensemble reordering : :    arrange the sampled values in the rank order structure of the raw    ensemble , to obtain the ecc postprocessed ensemble .",
    "an illustration of the ecc approach is given in figure [ fig : ecc ] , a dynamic version of which is available in the online supplement . here , the setting is four - dimensional .",
    "we consider surface temperature and sea level pressure in berlin and hamburg , respectively .",
    "the scatterplot matrix in the top panel illustrates the 50-member ecmwf ensemble forecast at a 24 hours lead time .",
    "clearly , there are dependencies between the margins ; for example , there is a positive association between temperature in berlin and temperature in hamburg , and there are negative associations between temperature and pressure .",
    "the scatterplot matrix in the middle panel is constructed from samples of the individually bma postprocessed predictive distributions . here",
    ", the systematic errors in the margins have been corrected , at the cost of a loss of the error dependence structure .",
    "the bottom panel elucidates the effects of the ecc ensemble reordering ; while the margins remain unchanged from the middle panel , the rank dependence structure of the raw ensemble is restored .    owing to the intuitive appeal and striking simplicity , which incurs essential no computational costs beyond the marginal postprocessing , approaches of ecc type are rapidly gaining prominence at weather centers worldwide , with variants recently having been implemented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and , among others .",
    "our goal here is to interpret , fuse and consolidate these and other , seemingly unrelated advances within the framework of ecc .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the common thread of the approaches lies in the adoption of the empirical copula of the raw ensemble , thereby restoring its rank dependence structure and justifying the term ensemble copula coupling .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : univariate ] we review and discuss statistical postprocessing techniques for univariate nwp ensemble output .",
    "general copula approaches to the handling of multivariate output are discussed in section [ sec : copulas ] , with subsequent focus on the ecc approach in section [ sec : ecc ] , where we distinguish the ecc - q , ecc - r and ecc - t variants , depending on the use of quantiles , random draws or transformations at the quantization stage .",
    "section [ sec : data ] turns to a case study on probabilistic predictions of temperature , pressure , precipitation and wind over germany , based on the ecmwf ensemble .",
    "the paper closes in section  [ sec : discussion ] , where we discuss benefits and limitations of the ecc approach and return to the general theme of uncertainty quantification for high - dimensional output from complex simulation models with intricate dependence structures .",
    "following the pioneering work of @xcite , various types of statistical postprocessing techniques for the output of nwp ensemble forecasts have been developed , with @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite providing critical reviews .",
    "as noted , postprocessing aims to correct for biases and dispersion errors in the ensemble output , and state of the art techniques for doing this can roughly be divided into mixture approaches , building on the ensemble bayesian model averaging ( bma ) approach of , and regression approaches , such as the nonhomogeneous regression ( nr ) method put forth by .    specifically , consider a univariate weather quantity of interest , @xmath0 , and write @xmath1 for the corresponding @xmath2 ensemble member forecasts . as noted , the ensemble bma approach uses mixture distributions of the general form @xmath10 where the left - hand side refers to the conditional distribution of @xmath0 given the ensemble member forecasts @xmath1 , and @xmath11 is a parametric distribution that depends on @xmath5 only .",
    "the mixture weights @xmath12 are nonnegative and sum to 1 ; they reflect the corresponding member s relative contributions to predictive skill over a training period .",
    "in contrast , the nr predictive distribution is a single parametric distribution of the general form @xmath13 where the right - hand side refers to a parametric family of probability distributions , with the parameters depending on all ensemble members simultaneously .",
    "the particular choice of a parametric model for the bma kernel @xmath14 or the nr distribution @xmath8 depends on the weather quantity at hand .",
    "table [ tab : bma ] sketches ensemble bma implementations for temperature and pressure , where the kernel @xmath15 is normal with mean @xmath16 and variance @xmath17 , precipitation , wind speed @xcite , wind direction , and visibility @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ensemble bma implementations are available for fog @xcite , visibility and ceiling @xcite .",
    "frequently , the parameters in the specifications for the mean and the variance of the kernels are subject to constraints ; for example , the variance parameters are often assumed to be constant across ensemble members .",
    "if the ensemble is generated in such a way that its members are statistically indistinguishable or exchangeable , as in the case of the ecmwf ensemble , the bma weights as well as the bma mean and variance parameters are assumed to be constant across ensemble members @xcite .",

    "that said , figure [ fig : spatial.temp ] illustrates the strongly positive effects of ecc on temperature field forecasts , where dependencies at short and moderate distances are of critical importance .",
    "here we consider the 1,221 nwp model grid boxes over germany , with the forecast made a day ahead for 2:00 am on april 25 , 2011 , for what promises to be a pleasant , unusually warm spring night .",
    "the postprocessing uses a single bma model of the form ( [ eq : bma.temp ] ) , which is trained on spatially pooled pairs of ensemble forecasts and corresponding nowcasts from the previous 20 days .",
    "the unprocessed raw ecmwf ensemble appears to capture spatial structure fairly well , but it has an overall negative bias , especially in the mountainous alpes region in the south and in the central east of the country . while the bma postprocessing addresses biases , and the use of a single bma model avoids inconsistencies between the univariate postprocessed predictive distributions themselves , the independent samples result in noisy and incoherent spatial structure .",
    "the ecc postprocessed ensemble inherits the bias - corrected marginals from the independent bma postprocessed forecast and simultaneously maintains the @xmath34 variate dependence structure in the raw ensemble .",
    "the nowcast that serves as grid based ground truth is the relevant initialization of the ecmwf s so - called control run .",
    ", scaledwidth=102.0% ]    while these examples concern the spatial case only , ecc is equally well suited to handling temporal and cross - variable dependencies , with figure [ fig : ecc ] illustrating the latter aspect . to generate physically realistic and consistent ensemble forecasts of temporal trajectories ,",
    "constraints can be put on the bma or nr parameters , so that they vary smoothly across lead times , which ensures the temporal consistency of the postprocessed marginal predictive distributions .",
    "then , the ecc approach can be used to account for dependence structures across lead times .",
    "these settings are being investigated in ongoing work , and we expect to report quantitative results in due time .",
    "the intensified attention to the quantification of uncertainty in the output of complex simulation models poses major challenges in a vast range of critical applications . in this paper , we have introduced the general uncertainty quantification framework of ensemble copula coupling ( ecc ) , which we have illustrated on the key example of numerical weather prediction ( nwp ) .",
    "the approach is conceptionally very simple and straightforward to implement in practice .",
    "starting from raw ensemble output , ecc employs standard techniques to obtain postprocessed predictive distributions for each of the univariate margins individually .",
    "then we quantize the postprocessed predictive distributions and adopt the rank dependence structure of the raw ensemble , as embodied by its empirical copula .",
    "the defining feature of the ecc approach , namely , the adoption of the rank order structure of the raw ensemble , also sets its limitations .",
    "the number of members in the ecc postprocessed ensemble equals that of the raw ensemble , which typically is small , and ecc operates under a perfect model assumption with respect to the multivariate rank dependence structure .",
    "however , for state of the art nwp models such an assumption seems reasonably adequate in practice and can be comfirmed by diagnostic checks , as we have illustrated in figure [ fig : motivation ] .",
    "currently , approaches of the ecc type are being investigated and tested by weather centers internationally ; see , for example , the recent work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we applaud these developments and call for case studies and quantitative comparisons to the schaake shuffle , which also admits an empirical copula interpretation . in ecc , the multivariate dependence structure of the forecast errors derives from the ensemble forecast ; in the schaake shuffle , it derives from a record of historical weather observations .",
    "judiciously designed combinations of the ecc and the schaake shuffle approaches might well lead to improved predictive performance .",
    "if the model output under consideration is low - dimensional or strongly structured , parametric copula approaches become available , which may allow for the correction of any systematic errors in the ensemble s representation of conditional dependence structures . here",
    ", the most prominent option lies in the use of gaussian copulas , as in the general approach of and in the temporally or spatially structured settings of and . in such situations ,",
    "it is to be expected that parametric techniques outperform the ecc approach and the schaake shuffle , and comparative studies of the predictive abilities and relative merits of the various methods are strongly encouraged . given its intuitive appeal and simplicity of implementation , the ecc approach offers a natural benchmark .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spatial.temp ] we have given an example of how ecc can be used to restore spatial consistency in weather field forecasts directly on the model grid .",
    "the aforementioned parametric gaussian approaches of and can achieve this , too , but require elaborate spatial statistical models to be fitted .",
    "in contrast , the computational and human resources necessitated by ecc are nearly negligible , and ecc can also handle temporal and cross - variable dependencies , for model output of nearly any dimensionality .    while we have focused on weather forecasting in this paper , the general framework of ecc as a multi - stage approach to the quantification of uncertainty in the output of complex simulation models with intricate multivariate dependence structures is likely to be useful in a vast range of applications .",
    "essentially , ecc can be applied whenever an ensemble of simulation runs is available , the ensemble is capable of realistically representing multivariate dependence structures , and training data for the statistical correction of the univariate margins are at hand . in this general",
    "setting of uncertainty quantification , the goals articulated by @xcite continue to provide guidance , in that we seek to gauge our incomplete knowledge of current , past or future quantities of interest by means of joint probability distributions , which ought to be as sharp as possible , subject to them being calibrated , in the broad sense of reality being statistically compatible with the postprocessed distributions .",
    "a dynamic version of figure [ fig : ecc ] is provided in the online supplement .",
    "the ensemble reordering step in the ecc approach is elucidated when switching back and forth between pages .",
    "we are indebted to colleagues at heidelberg university , the university of washington , the german weather service ( dwd ) , the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) and elsewhere , including but not limited to konrad bogner , jonathan flowerdew , renate hagedorn , tom hamill , alex lenkoski , martin leutbecher , florian pappenberger , pierre pinson and david richardson , who have graciously shared their thoughts and expertise . in particular ,",
