    "an image of the milky way , taken by an observer in another galaxy would probably reveal a spiral structure dotted with many bright hii regions .",
    "the milky way is believed to be spiral galaxy , and a best `` educated guess '' is that it is a barred sb to sc galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , since we are inside the milky way , it has proved very difficult to properly characterize its structure @xcite .",
    "originally , studies of hi emission offered the opportunity to map the structure of the milky way @xcite .",
    "hi emission on longitude - velocity plots clearly demonstrated that there were some coherent , large - scale structures , which were probably spiral arms in the milky way .",
    "however , determining accurate distances to hi clouds proved problematic , and this made the task of turning longitude - velocity data into a true plan - view of the milky way very uncertain @xcite .",
    "later , millimeter - wave observations of molecules , such as co , also revealed coherent , large - scale structures with higher contrast than seen in hi @xcite .",
    "but , again , uncertain distances to molecular clouds precluded making a true map of the milky way with sufficient accuracy map the spiral structure of the milky way .",
    "@xcite published a `` plan - view '' model of the spiral structure of the milky way . this approach involved combining optical observations of young stars and radio data of hi cloud and hii region emissions .",
    "luminosity distances to nearby stars were used where available and kinematic distances elsewhere , mostly for more distant hii regions .",
    "more recently , @xcite have modeled pulsar dispersion measures to refine the georgelin & georgelin model . while subject to very significant uncertainties from kinematic distances , the georgelin & georgelin model has remained the basis for the `` standard '' model of the spiral structure of the milky way for over 30 years .",
    "the primary goal of our project is to reinforce the foundations of models of the spiral structure of the milky way by measuring distances directly to regions of massive star formation across large portions of the milky way .",
    "this paper is the first ( paper i ) in a series , including papers ii through v @xcite published in this volume .",
    "we are using the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) to determine trigonometric parallaxes of strong methanol maser sources , which are associated with regions of massive star formation and their attendant hii regions . sampling spiral arms roughly every kpc",
    "should determine the true locations of arms , and allow us to use other databases to `` interpolate '' between the star forming regions measured with masers .",
    "with accurate distances to some of the largest star forming regions , we should be able to verify the existence and determine the locations of the postulated perseus , carina ",
    "sagittarius , crux ",
    "scutum , and norma spiral arms .",
    "ultimately , we hope to extend these measurements with a larger sample , including a similar study in the southern hemisphere , and produce a map of the 3-dimensional structure of bright material associated with massive young stars that defines spiral structure .",
    "in addition to distances , the observations used to determine trigonometric parallaxes yield excellent measurements of secular proper motions , with accuracies of @xmath4  @xcite . combining radial velocity measurements with proper motions ( and distances ) yields full 3-dimensional velocities , relative to the motion of the sun . thus , through this project and other vlbi efforts , notably the japanese project vera @xcite",
    ", we hope to determine the full kinematics of massive star forming regions in the milky way , which will accurately define the rotation curve of the milky way and , in turn , its enclosed mass as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "finally , we should be able to show how material in spiral arms actually moves , to characterize kinematic anomalies ( such as in the perseus arm ) and , hopefully , to understand why these anomalies occur .",
    "methanol ( ) masers are excellent astrometric targets for parallax measurements . class ii methanol masers ( 6.7 and 12  ghz transitions ) are widespread and associated with newly formed stars in regions of high - mass star formation .",
    "the masers generally are compact ( @xmath6  mas ) , slow moving , and vary slowly , which minimizes the possibility of brightness variations mimicking position shifts . while the 6.7  ghz masing transition is generally stronger than the 12  ghz transition ,",
    "there are dozens of 12  ghz sources with peak flux densities @xmath7  jy , which is sufficient to serve as a phase - reference for the vlba . also , the 12  ghz transition is at a high enough frequency to offer minimal sensitivity to unmodeled ionospheric fluctuations and to minimize interstellar scatter broadening .",
    "however , once all 12  ghz masers have been measured , the 6.7  ghz methanol masers will be attractive targets .",
    "we note that 22  ghz  masers are also good astrometric targets ; they are compact , strong , widespread , and the high frequency of the transition minimizes ionospheric fluctuations and interstellar scattering problems . however ,  masers can be variable on time scales as short as weeks to months and , since parallax observations are best made over a timespan of 1  yr , this can be problematic .",
    "water masers are generally associated with high - velocity outflows from young stellar objects . since , for well - planned measurements ,",
    "parallax and proper motion are essentially uncorrelated , parallax estimates should not be affected by the magnitude of the proper motion .",
    "however , one of the most astrophyscially interesting by - products of maser astrometry is the determination of the full space - motions of the associated young stellar objects .",
    "if there are fast internal motions , then one needs to understand details of the outflows in order to transform from measured maser motions to a frame tied to the central stellar object .",
    "the accuracy of this transformation is typically better than a few for slowly expanding methanol masers @xcite , but can be of order 10  for the rapidly expanding  masers @xcite .      since astrometric accuracy is enhanced by finding background sources ( ie , qsos ) as close in angle to the maser sources as possible , we first conducted surveys for background sources near potential maser targets . using the sustainable recording rate of 128 mbits s@xmath8 of the vlba in 2006 (",
    "which is being substantially upgraded ) , we are able to use background sources as weak as a few mjy .",
    "we identified candidate background sources by selecting all sources in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) that were nearly unresolved ( at @xmath9 resolution ) and within @xmath10 of a maser target .",
    "typically we found @xmath11 candidates stronger than @xmath12  mjy for any maser target .",
    "these candidate sources were observed in snap - shot mode with the vla at 8 and 15  ghz to determine a spectral index and further test compactness .",
    "candidates that remained unresolved with these observations and displayed a synchrotron spectral index are likely to be extragalactic and have compact cores that can be imaged with vlba observations .",
    "typically we find between 1 and 3 suitable qsos within about 1.5 degrees of a target methanol maser source @xcite . when possible we re - observed with these sources with the vla a- or b - configurations to determine absolute positions to better than 30  mas .",
    "the main source of systematic error for cm - wave phase - referenced observations is uncompensated interferometric delays introduced by the earth s atmosphere and ionosphere .",
    "the model used in the vlba correlator is a seasonally - averaged calculation that does not take into account variations in atmospheric pressure , total water - vapor content , nor the delay induced by the ionosphere . at a frequency of 12",
    "ghz the correlator model will typically be in error by about 0.2 to 0.4 nsec of delay , corresponding to 5 to 10  cm of excess path length , for sources at high elevation angles .",
    "substantial gains in reducing systematic errors owing to atmospheric mis - modeling can be obtained by directly measuring and removing these effects .    for the last decade",
    ", we have been working to understand better our sources of systematic error and to find methods of correcting our data for these errors @xcite currently , we use observations of extragalactic sources spread over the sky to measure broad - band delays . for sources with well determined positions ( better than 1  mas )",
    ", residual delays measured by the vlba will be dominated by the effects of atmospheric mis - modeling .",
    "typically , we observe @xmath13 such sources over a range of source azimuths and elevations in rapid succession over a time span of about 40 min .",
    "the choice of sources and the observing sequence were determined by computer code with the following procedure : we generated a candidate source list starting with the icrf catalog @xcite and keeping only the 60 sources that had been observed @xmath14 times , had coordinate uncertainties @xmath15  mas , and had little structure at 8 ghz (  structural indexes of 1 or 2 ) .",
    "trial schedules were generated by randomly skipping though the candidate source list ; we required that a source was above an elevation of @xmath16 at a minimum of 6 vlba stations and that no station missed more than a total of 5 sources . for each trial schedule , we generated fake data and performed a least - squares fit solving for zenith atmospheric delays and clock offsets for all stations .",
    "we generally examined 1000 trial schedules and chose the one that minimized the largest of the formal zenith delay uncertainties among the 10 stations .",
    "we placed these `` geodetic '' blocks before the start , in the middle , and after the end of our phase - reference observations , in order to monitor slow changes in the total atmospheric delay for each telescope .",
    "the data were taken in left circular polarization with eight 4-mhz bands that spanned 480 mhz of bandwidth between 12.10 and 12.58 ghz ; the bands were spaced in a `` minimum redundancy configuration '' to uniformly sample , as best as possible , all frequency differences .",
    "this was accomplished with bands spaced by 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 15 , 22 , 32 and 34 times 14 mhz .",
    "the data were correlated , corrected for ionospheric delays using total electron content measurements @xcite , and residual multi - band delays and fringe rates were determined for all sources .",
    "the multi - band delays and fringe rates were modeled as owing to a vertical atmospheric delay and delay - rate , as well as a clock offset and clock drift rate , at each antenna .",
    "owing to the short ( 1  min ) integration times , the fringe rates are fairly uncertain and the multi - band delays carry most of the weight in the solutions . in order to protect the fitting process from occasional bad data , we used an iterative approach that down - weights outliers relative to the previous solution . specifically , after each iteration , the uncertainty assigned to the each delay or fringe rate datum was increased by a factor of @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the post - fit residual divided by the original uncertainty .",
    "this procedure heavily down - weights @xmath19 outliers . typically , only a few percent of the input data were significantly down - weighted .",
    "sample data , model , and residuals from our first epoch observations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fit_geodetic ] .    in some cases ,",
    "the delay residuals indicated departures from the linear ( in time ) model ; an example can be seen in the non - zero mean delay residuals ( _ red crosses _ ) in fig .",
    "[ fit_geodetic ] for the interferometer baseline formed by vlba antennas ov and pt .",
    "we believe this is due to unusually large , quasi - random , changes in the zenith delay at antenna 8 during this observation . in order to improve the calibration",
    ", we then solved for zenith delays and clock offsets for each 40-min block separately .",
    "calibration of the phase - referencing data was done by linearly interpolating between these three solutions .    using our least - squares fitting program , we estimated zenith atmospheric path - delays with accuracies typically @xmath20  cm ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "independent comparisons of our technique with those using global positioning system ( gps ) data and an image - optimization approach confirm this accuracy @xcite .",
    "correction for atmospheric delays results in significant improvement in relative position accuracy , compared to observations that rely solely on the vlba correlator model . finally , using more than one background reference source , at different offsets and position angles with respect to the target maser source , when phase - referencing further reduces sensitivity to any residual systematic errors from atmospheric mis - modeling .",
    "when conducting phase - referenced observations , it is important that the position of the reference source is well determined @xcite . a position error , @xmath22 , for the reference source results in residual phases shifts that are sinusoidal with a 24 hour period and an amplitude of @xmath23  turns , where @xmath24 is the interferometer fringe spacing .",
    "when applied to a target source , offset from the reference source by @xmath25 , the reference phases can no longer be perfectly modeled as a position shift ( at the position of the target source ) .",
    "this results in a second - order position shift of @xmath26 , as well a degradation of the imaging . while the second - order position shift , in principle , can be constant from epoch to epoch and not affect a parallax measurement",
    ", the image degradation can be serious and even preclude detection of a weak source .",
    "we attempted to determine the absolute positions of our sources to better than @xmath27  mas accuracy .",
    "the 12 ghz methanol masers for which we sought to measure parallaxes contain some bright , compact spots that serve as good astrometric targets .",
    "since we used strong maser signals as the phase reference , in order to allow the detection of weak background sources close in angle on the sky , we needed to measure the maser positions . because the 12 ghz methanol masers are often spread over a region of @xmath28 , we had to determine their positions from our vlba data .",
    "we accomplished this in one of two ways .",
    "if one of the background sources had a well determined position ( @xmath29  mas ) and we could image it after phase referencing to the maser ( even with a poorly determined _ a priori _ maser position ) , then we iteratively refined the maser position to a similar accuracy .    when the maser position can not be measured against a known source by phase referencing",
    ", one can take advantage of the excellent correlator model and map of a strong maser spot by simply fourier transforming the data , following amplitude calibration and atmospheric model correction , but _ without _ phase referencing ( after calibration `` step 3 '' describe in  [ calib ] ) .",
    "this produces a very crude image , which resembles optical speckles , owing to the large phase excursions introduced mostly by short - term fluctuations in the atmospheric delay . for our data ,",
    "the brighter speckles were concentrated in a region of about 50 to 100  mas radius , and we were able to estimate the centroid of the speckle distribution to an accuracy of about 10 to 20  mas .",
    "table  [ table : positions ] lists the absolute positions the maser and background continuum sources , as well as the observed brightness and restoring beam sizes at the first epoch .",

    "a similar sequence was used for the  block ; however , with only two background sources , we used eight repetitions of such a cycle .",
    "we used the methanol maser as the phase - reference source , because it is considerably stronger than the background sources and could be detected on individual baselines in the available on - source time .",
    "we placed observations of two strong sources ( j0530 + 1331 and j0555 + 3948 ) near the beginning , middle and end of the observations in order to monitor delay and electronic phase differences among the if bands . in practice , however , we found minimal drifts and used only a single scan for this calibration .",
    "we also used data from these strong sources to check the variations in phase across the bandpasses and found them to vary by @xmath38 across the central 90% of the band . since the masers were observed near band center and we discarded the outer channels for the continuum sources , we made no bandpass corrections .",

    "the raw data recorded on tape ( or more recently on transportable disks ) at each antenna were shipped to the vlba correlation facility in socorro , nm . the data from individual antenna pairs were cross - correlated with an integration time of 0.92  sec .",
    "integration times were kept short to allow position shifting of the data to accommodate a priori uncertainties in the maser positions . at this integration time",
    ", we could not process all eight frequency bands in one pass with sufficient spectral resolution for the maser band , without exceeding the maximum correlator output rate .",
    "thus , we correlated the data in two passes .",
    "one pass was processed with 16 spectral channels for each of the eight frequency bands .",
    "this data was used for the geodetic blocks ( to determine atmospheric delays and clock drifts ) and for the background continuum sources observed in rapid - switching ( phase - referencing ) mode .",
    "another pass was processed with 256 spectral channels , but only for the single ( dual - polarized ) frequency band containing the maser signals , giving a velocity resolution of 0.38  , assuming a rest frequency of 12178.597  mhz for the @xmath44  e transition of methanol .",
    "we calibrated the correlated data using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the calibration sequence included four steps .",
    "step 1 involved correction of interferometer delays and phases for the effects of diurnal feed rotation ( parallactic angle ) , for errors in the values of the earth s orientation parameters used at the time of correlation , and for any small position shifts in the a priori coordinates of either the maser or background sources . since the vlba correlator model includes no ionospheric delays , we used global total electron content models to remove ionospheric effects . at this point",
    ", we also corrected the data for residual zenith atmospheric delays and clock drifts ( determined from the geodetic block data ) .",
    "in step 2 we adjusted interferometer visibility amplitudes for the small ( few % ) effects of biases in the threshold levels of the data samplers at each station .",
    "we also entered system temperature and antenna gain curve information into calibration tables , which allow conversion of correlation coefficients to flux density units .    in step 3",
    ", we performed a `` manual phase - calibration '' to remove delay and phase differences among all eight 4-mhz bands .",
    "this was done by selecting one scan on a strong calibrator , fitting fringe patterns to the data for each frequency band , and then shifting delays and phases to remove offsets . at this point ,",
    "the interferometer data had delay errors less than @xmath45  nsec ( @xmath46  cm of excess path ) for sources observed at high elevations .",
    "finally , we shifted the frequency axes of the maser interferometer spectra to compensate for the doppler shift caused by changing projection of the earth s orbit and spin toward the source , in order to keep a constant  in any given spectral channel .",
    "after step 3 , the visibility phases are calibrated for all known effects and residual phases are typically dominated by short - term atmospheric variations of @xmath47  cm and nearly constant absolute position errors usually less than @xmath47  mas ( see  [ abs_pos ] and table  [ table : positions ] ) .",
    "atmospheric variations cancel , to first order in the source separations ( typically @xmath48 or 0.02 radians on the sky ) , when constructing phase differences ( `` phase - referencing '' ) between the target maser and the background continuum source .",
    "absolute position errors are largely constant over our observations and cancel over time when fitting for a parallax .",
    "( only the time - variable position changes , owing to parallax and proper motion , will not cancel in time .",
    "typical galactic proper motions of @xmath46  result in differential position shifts of typically 0.02  mas , when the galactic source ( maser ) is used as the phase reference . )",
    "the final calibration , step 4 , involved selecting a maser phase - reference .",
    "we used a single spectral channel of the maser source , selected to be strong on the longest interferometer baselines , and hence compact .",
    "the reference phases from spectral channel 128 at @xmath49  of  are shown in fig .  [ s252_phases ] .",

    "after calibration , we fourier transformed the gridded , using the aips task imagr , to make images of the maser emission in all spectral channels and the background continuum sources .",
    "the images were deconvolved with the point - source response using the clean algorithm . in order to provide the data needed to measure parallax and proper motions , we fitted an elliptical gaussian brightness distribution to the brightest maser spots and the background continuum sources at all four epochs , using the task jmfit",

    "the choice of data and their weighting in the parallax and proper motion fitting is complicated by two issues .",
    "firstly , some maser spots are blended in position and frequency and the intensity of the blended components can vary with time . generally , we fitted positions in all spectral channels where the maser spots looked to be good candidates for astrometry (  compact emission , minimal blending , etc . ) .",
    "we then fitted a parallax and proper motion to each spot separately in order to assess its astrometric quality , based on the magnitude of the post - fit residuals .",
    "usually only a small number of maser spots were passed along for final fitting .",
    "secondly , the formal position uncertainties were often unrealistically small , since ( a priori unknown ) sources of systematic error often dominate over random noise .",
    "the north - south components of relative positions often have greater uncertainty than the east - west components , because ( 1 ) interferometer beams are generally larger in the north - south direction and ( 2 ) systematic errors from unmodeled atmospheric delays usually are more strongly correlated with north - south positions @xcite . in order to allow for such systematic errors",
    ", we assigned independent `` error floors '' to the east - west and north - south position data and added these floors in quadrature with the formal position - fitting uncertainties .",
    "trial parallax and proper motion fits were conducted and a separate reduced @xmath53 ( per degree of freedom ) statistic was calculated for the east - west and north - south residuals .",
    "the error floors were then adjusted iteratively so as to make the reduced @xmath54 for each coordinate .",
    "individual maser spots were allowed to have different proper motions , owing to internal motions that are typically a few  for 12-ghz methanol masers . however , since we expect no detectable proper motion for the extragalactic sources , in the cases where we had more than one extragalactic source , we constrained the proper motion of any given maser spot to be the same when measured against all extragalactic sources .",
    "note that we used a single east - west and north - south error floor in any least - square fit and these floors are the same for the combined and the individual fits .",

    "the dirty beam was about 8 by 3  mas at a pa of @xmath86 . because of the limited interferometer data for this low declination source , we used a restoring beam equal to the fwhm of the dirty beam .    in fig .",

    ", the proper motions correspond to @xmath90  and @xmath91   eastward and northward , respectively .    unlike for , where we had multiple spots and background sources , for  we found only one maser and one background source suitable for astrometric measurements .",
    "the vlba calibrator survey shows that in 2002 at 8.6 ghz the background source , j07351735 , had a second component of @xmath92  jy beam@xmath8 separated by @xmath93  mas at a position angle of @xmath94 east of north from the strongest component of @xmath95  jy beam@xmath96 at 12.2  ghz we found j07351735 to be dominated by a single component with peak brightnesses of 0.29 , 0.24 , 0.31 and 0.32  jy beam@xmath8 at our four epochs .",
    "the apparent variations in brightness are small and consistent with a nearly constant brightness source that is imaged in the presence of typical calibration errors , especially variable phase - referencing coherence losses at different epochs .    in light of the potential limitations of a single background source and a single maser spot , and",

    "in order to study the 3-dimensional motion of the maser sources in the galaxy , we need to convert their radial and proper motions from the equatorial heliocentric reference frame in which they are measured into a galactic reference frame .",
    "a convenient galactic frame is one rotating with a circular velocity @xmath98 at the position of the source : ie , a `` local standard of rest '' at the location of maser",
