    "in a previous series of investigations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the clustering properties of  and  absorbers have been investigated , using an extensive catalog of heavy  element absorption  line systems drawn from the literature .",
    "these authors used a line  of  sight correlation function analysis and found evidence for strong ( and evolving ) power  law clustering on comoving scales of 1 to 16   of a form that is consistent with that found for galaxies and clusters at low redshift , and of amplitude such that absorbers are correlated on scales of clusters of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , there also appears to be superclustering on scales of 50 to 100  ( quashnock  1996 ) , suggesting that these absorbers are biased tracers of the higher  density regions of space , and that agglomerations of strong absorbers along a line of sight are indicators of clusters and superclusters .",
    "this relationship is supported by recent observations of so  called `` lyman break '' galaxies ( @xcite ) that were found to be concentrated in coherent structures of size @xmath3 .",
    "these structures were found to contain metal ",
    "line systems . also",
    ", the amplitude of the correlation function of these lyman break galaxies at @xmath4 ( @xmath5=@xmath6  [ @xmath7 ; @xcite ) is consistent with that found for  absorbers ( @xmath5=@xmath8 ; @xcite ) . while the exact relationship between high  redshift galaxies and heavy  element absorbers is unclear ,",
    "it does appear that these systems are tracing the richer agglomerations of the clustering network , perhaps one that is similar to that found in detailed three  dimensional numerical investigations of the distribution of the richest ly@xmath9 absorbers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus it is of great interest to measure and characterize the clustering of the absorbers , over as broad a range in scale as possible and with special attention given to the largest scales , using the best statistical tools that are at hand .",
    "quashnock  ( 1996 ) were unable to relate the superclustering found on very large ( @xmath10 100 ) scales with the power ",
    "law clustering found later on smaller scales ( @xcite ) , nor locate the approximate scale dividing these two regimes , because they used a two  point correlation function analysis requiring bins too large ( 25 ) for this purpose .    here",
    ", we examine the line  of  sight clustering of qso heavy  element absorption  line systems , using a new measure of clustering , called the _ reduced second moment measure _ , @xmath0 , that directly measures the mean over  density of absorbers on scales @xmath1 .",
    "this measure  while closely related to other second  order measures such as the correlation function or the power spectrum  has a number of distinct statistical properties which make possible a continuous exploration of clustering as a function of scale .",
    "it has been well  studied by statisticians ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and recently astrophysicists ( @xcite ) , and several estimators have been developed for it .",
    "the absorber catalog , with a total of over 2200 absorbers listed over 500 qsos , permits exploration of clustering over a large range in scale ( from about 1 to over 100 ) and redshift ( @xmath11 from about 1 to 4 ) .",
    "ultimately , we are interested in a three  dimensional description of the absorber distribution ; nevertheless , much of the useful information about this distribution lies in the one  dimensional distribution of the absorption  line systems along the lines of sight to qsos ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the large number of such lines of sight makes it possible to make some inferences about three ",
    "dimensional clustering from one  dimensional statistical measures .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in   2 we define the reduced second moment measure , present the estimator we have used for it , and discuss its statistical properties . in ",
    "3 we present our results for the reduced second moment measure , using a large sample of  absorbers with median redshift @xmath2 . in   4 we discuss the implications of these results on our picture of absorber clustering .",
    "here we assume that the clustering of absorbers is stationary ( does not depend on time ) and homogeneous ( does not depend on direction or location ) .",
    "the first assumption is likely not to be strictly true , since growth of the correlation with decreasing redshift has been detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus our results here are averages for our sample , which has a characteristic redshift given by the median @xmath12 .",
    "we follow the usual convention and take the hubble constant , @xmath13 , to be 100@xmath14  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 and take @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "consider the process of absorber locations along some line of sight , and let @xmath18 be the mean number of absorbers per unit comoving length .",
    "define the _ reduced second moment measure _",
    ", @xmath0 , as the conditional expectation , or average  given that there is an absorber at @xmath19  of the number of absorbers ( other than the one at @xmath19 itself ) , @xmath20 , that are within a comoving distance @xmath21 of @xmath19 , normalized by @xmath18 : @xmath22 \\ ;   .\\ ] ] because of our assumption of homogeneity , the expected number of absorbers in equation  ( 1 ) does not depend on @xmath19 . with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the comoving distance @xmath21 between two absorbers at redshifts @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 is @xmath25 .    in terms of the two  point correlation function @xmath26 ( @xcite ; 1993 ) ,",
    "the reduced second moment measure is given by @xmath27 if no correlations are present , then @xmath28 .",
    "simply put , in this case the number of surrounding absorbers within distance @xmath21 of @xmath19 would not depend on the fact that there is an absorber at @xmath19 , and would simply be equal to @xmath29 .",
    "( the factor 2 arises because we consider distinct absorbers within a distance @xmath21 , or in the interval ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) around any given absorber . )",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is then a measure of the relative mean density of absorbers around other absorbers , averaged over scales less than @xmath21 .",
    "the relative mean _ over  density _ ,",
    "@xmath33 , can be written in terms of the power spectrum , @xmath34 , the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath26 , or equivalently , in terms of the dimensionless power per logarithmic wavenumber , @xmath35 : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the sine  integral .",
    "thus the reduced second moment measure , @xmath0 , is closely related to other second  order measures such as the correlation function or the power spectrum , and it directly measures the mean over  density of absorbers on scales less than @xmath21 .",
    "however , it has a number of distinct and desirable statistical properties which we examine below in   2.3 .",
    "let @xmath38 be the comoving length of the @xmath39th line of sight , i.e. , the section of the @xmath39th qso spectrum which has been effectively searched for absorbers . in figure  1 , we show the cumulative distribution of the comoving lengths of 274 qso lines of sight ( over an approximate redshift range @xmath40 ) in the vanden berk et al .",
    "almost all of the lengths are shorter than 400 , but the median length @xmath41 350 , meaning that there is information on the clustering of the absorbers on scales of 100  or more .",
    "let @xmath42 be the number of absorbers found in the @xmath39th line of sight at positions @xmath43 .",
    "if there are a total of @xmath44 lines of sight , then the total comoving length and number of absorbers are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "an estimate for the mean number of absorbers per unit comoving length is @xmath47 .    from equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "a natural estimate of the reduced second moment measure , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this estimate sums over pairs of absorbers that are on the same line of sight and within distance @xmath21 of each other .    however , this estimator is biased low , because neighboring absorbers that lie outside the line of sight can not be counted .",
    "one way to remove the bias due to edge effects is to use the _ rigid motion corrected _ estimator ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which corrects for these edge effects by weighting the summand in equation ( 4 ) by a factor @xmath51 which depends on the separation @xmath52 relative to the lengths @xmath38 of the lines of sight .",
    "this factor is the probability , given that there is a first absorber somewhere on some line of sight , that a second absorber of fixed separation from the first would also be contained within the same line if sight .",
    "we find that this probability is @xmath53 ( where the @xmath54 superscript indicates that a summand is included in the sum only if it is positive ) , so that the edge  corrected estimator we use is @xmath55      this estimator has the following statistical property : @xmath56 $ ] = @xmath57 _ exactly _ under any homogeneous and isotropic model for the absorbers .",
    "furthermore , while @xmath48 is not an exactly unbiased estimator for @xmath0 , it is a consistent estimator for @xmath0 in the sense that @xmath48 tends to @xmath0 in probability as @xmath44 increases .",
    "let us contrast this estimator with the quantity @xmath58 used in quashnock  ( 1996 ) to measure clustering .",
    "for an interval @xmath59 , @xmath58 is the number of pairs of absorbers whose separation is in the interval @xmath60 divided by the number of pairs that would be expected in @xmath60 if the @xmath61 absorbers were randomly distributed , minus  1 .",
    "this statistic has the desirable property that it tends to 0 as @xmath44 increases if @xmath26 is identically 0 on @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , positive values of @xmath58 indicate clustering over the range of distances in @xmath60 . however , it does not provide an appropriate estimate of @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , @xmath63 $ ] does not tend to @xmath62 as @xmath44 increases .",
    "for example , if all lines of sight were of equal length @xmath64 , it is possible to show that as @xmath65 , @xmath66 the fact that this limit generally depends on @xmath64 is undesirable for purposes of obtaining a quantitative assessment of the clustering of absorbers .",
    "when @xmath67 is nearly constant on @xmath60 , the limit in equation  ( 6 ) is approximately @xmath68 , as one would hope .",
    "unfortunately , the moderate size of this data set requires the use of rather wide bins , and quashnock  ( 1996 ) use values of @xmath69 of 25  and greater . using the relationship between @xmath67 and @xmath70 in equation  ( 2 )",
    ", we can easily obtain a consistent estimator of @xmath62 as @xmath44 increases .",
    "specifically , @xmath71/2 $ ] converges in probability to @xmath62 as @xmath44 increases .",
    "by examining @xmath48 as a function of @xmath21 , we can make a _ continuous _ exploration of clustering as a function of scale , without the binning required when using a correlation function analysis .",
    "in particular , this permits a more detailed examination of the relationship between small  scale clustering ( @xcite ) and the superclustering found by quashnock  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the reduced second moment measure estimator ( eq .  [ 5 ] ) is easy to compute and has well  understood statistical properties .",
    "we have used equation ( 5 ) to estimate the reduced second moment measure , @xmath48 , for 274 qso lines of sight , obtained from the vanden berk et al .",
    "a total of 352  absorbers have been selected from this heterogeneous catalog , using selection criteria ( quashnock  1996 ; @xcite ) designed to obtain as homogeneous a data set as possible .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers for a detailed description of the selection criteria .    in figure  2 , we show our results for the quantity @xmath72 _ ( solid line ) _ for this sample .",
    "this quantity has expectation value unity , if there is no clustering of absorbers along lines of sight ( see eq . [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we have constructed 1000 data sets of 352 absorbers uniformly distributed along the 274 qso lines of sight , these lines having the same distribution of comoving lengths as in our actual data sample ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the 95% region of variation of @xmath73 for these 1000 simulated data sets , about the expectation value of unity , is also shown in figure  2 _ ( dashed lines)_. our estimated value of @xmath73 for the  absorber data set is much greater than the upper limit of this band , for values of @xmath21 between 1 and 20 .",
    "for example , for @xmath74  our estimate is more than 12@xmath75 above unity , meaning that a simulated data set with uniformly distributed absorbers would essentially never have a @xmath76 as large as is measured .",
    "thus  absorbers cluster significantly on these scales .",
    "we compare these results for @xmath73 with those of quashnock & vanden berk ( 1998 )  who found that the correlation function of  absorbers on scales of 1 to 16  is consistent with a power law of the form @xmath77 , with @xmath78 and @xmath79  by substituting this form of the correlation function into equation ( 2 ) . in figure  2 _",
    "( light line ) _ , we show the value of @xmath80 if absorbers have this power  law correlation function . on scales smaller than 1   ( @xcite ) , eq .  [ 2 ] implies that @xmath0 in this power ",
    "law case is determined only to within an additive constant . here",
    ", we have fixed @xmath0 to its measured value at @xmath21 = 5 . ]",
    "this form of clustering appears to describe the estimated reduced second moment measure @xmath48 reasonably well , out to scales @xmath81 20 ; afterwards , there appears to be a break in the form of @xmath73 .",
    "we have investigated the significance of this excess by examining the quantity @xmath82/[2(r-20 ) ] = [ \\int_{20}^r \\xi(u)\\ , du]/(r-20 ) \\equiv \\delta_{20}(r)$ ] , shown in panel  _ a _ of figure  3 _ ( solid line ) _ for the same sample of  absorbers as in figure  2 . from equation ( 2 ) , @xmath83 also has expectation value of unity , if the correlation function is zero on scales greater than 20 . from figure",
    "3 , it appears that @xmath83 is greater than unity on scales @xmath84 30 .",
    "we have estimated the error in the estimate of @xmath83 by a bootstrap resampling method in which we randomly pick 274 qso lines of sight from the actual data sample , with replacement , i.e. , allowing for the same line of sight to be picked multiple times ( see @xcite , or @xcite , for a review of bootstrap methods for estimating errors ) .",
    "this method ensures that the distribution of lengths of the resampled data sets is the same as that of the actual sample ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in panel  _ a _ of figure  3 _ ( dashed lines ) _ , we also show the bootstrap  estimated 95% pointwise ( i.e. , for each value of @xmath21 ) confidence region for @xmath83 . while there is some uncertainty in the estimate of this quantity ,",
    "it does appear that there is significant excess clustering on scales @xmath85 30 .",
    "for example , when resampling data sets by the bootstrap method , @xmath86(50  ) is greater than unity 99.998% of the time .",
    "the bootstrap procedure for obtaining confidence intervals we have employed here has the desirable property that its validity does not require any special assumptions about the nature of the absorber distribution along a line of sight .",
    "more specifically , because it uses lines of sight as the sampling unit in the resampling scheme , it only requires that the location of absorbers on _ different _ lines of sight are independent .",
    "since the majority of lines of sight are not within 100  of any other line of sight , this independence assumption is reasonable . by using a resampling in which groups of lines of sight are resampled rather than individual lines",
    ", we believe it should be possible to detect if this independence assumption is appropriate .",
    "we plan to investigate this possibility and other refinements of the bootstrapping procedure in future work .",
    "the procedures used by quashnock & vanden berk ( 1998 ) and quashnock  ( 1996 ) also assume that absorber locations on different lines of sight are independent .",
    "in addition , they both make use of further approximations about the absorber location process within a line of sight .",
    "quashnock & vanden berk ( 1998 ) obtain approximate confidence intervals for the line  of  sight correlation function up to distances of 16  by assuming that every pair of points whose separation is in the interval @xmath60 is independent of every other such pair .",
    "this assumption may be a good approximation when @xmath69 is small , although simulations in stoyan , bertram , & wendrock ( 1993 ) suggest that such an assumption may often lead to overoptimistic confidence intervals .",
    "on larger scales , for which quashnock  ( 1996 ) have used fairly wide bins ( greater than 25  wide ) , assuming independence between pairs with distance in @xmath60 may be problematic . there , the confidence intervals are based on assuming that one can ignore correlations beyond second  order in absorber locations along a line of sight . while we have no evidence that such an assumption is wrong , the bootstrapping procedure we employ is valid whether or not this assumption is reasonable .    we have also searched for clustering on scales greater than 50 , 100 , and 150 , by examining the quantities @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , shown _",
    "( solid lines ) _ in panels _ b _ , _ c _ , and _",
    "d _ , respectively , of figure  3 .",
    "again we also show the bootstrap  estimated 95% confidence region for each quantity _ ( dashed lines)_. we find that @xmath87 is significantly greater than unity , for scales @xmath90 50 , meaning that there is significant clustering on those scales .",
    "namely , when resampling data sets by the bootstrap method , @xmath91(100  ) is greater than unity 99.91% of the time .",
    "however , @xmath89 is statistically consistent with unity for all @xmath92 150 , and @xmath88 is consistent with unity everywhere except ( marginally ) for @xmath93 200 .",
    "this supports the conclusion of quashnock et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that at present there is no significant evidence for clustering of absorbers on scales greater than 100 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the line  of  sight clustering of qso heavy  element absorption  line systems can be examined using a new measure of clustering , called the reduced second moment measure , @xmath0 , that directly measures the mean over  density of absorbers on scales @xmath1 . by estimating @xmath0 , we find that the absorbers are strongly clustered on scales from 1 to 20 , in a manner that is consistent with a power  law correlation function of the form found by quashnock & vanden berk ( 1998 ) .",
    "the form and amplitude of this clustering strongly suggests that the absorbers are tracing the large  scale structure seen in the distribution of galaxies and clusters .",
    "however , because we have only examined the clustering of absorbers in one dimension , along the line of sight , there remains the possibility that some or all of the excess clumping is due to velocity effects , i.e. , groups of component absorbers spread out in redshift due to velocity dispersion . (",
    "note that at redshift @xmath12 , 1  corresponds to velocity differences @xmath94 = 180  in the rest frame : the flattening in @xmath95 seen near 1  in figure  2 may be due to velocity dispersion , as well as limited spectral resolution . )",
    "this has been argued by crotts , burles , & tytler ( 1997 ) , who explore the spatial clustering of  systems along adjacent lines of sight , and claim that it is significantly weaker than clustering along a line of sight .",
    "quashnock & vanden berk ( 1998 ) have shown that , whether due to peculiar motions inside clusters , or to actual spatial clustering on megaparsec scales , that the scale , the form , and the amplitude of the clustering are all indicative of an association of strong absorbers with clusters .",
    "such an association is also supported by observations of `` lyman break '' galaxies ( see   1 ) .    in figure  2",
    ", there is a sharp break in the form of @xmath48 at 20 .",
    "it thus appears that ( for @xmath16 ) this is the scale marking the boundary of power ",
    "law clustering on smaller scales . using the reduced second moment measure has permitted an approximate determination of this break . from figure  3",
    "( panels _ a__d _ ) there is evidence for clustering on scales of up to 100   but not on larger scales  in excess of that which would be expected from a smooth transition to homogeneity .",
    "one possible interpretation of this excess is that it is due to superclustering on scales of 50 to 100   ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; quashnock  1996 , and references therein ) , much like what is seen locally in the distribution of galaxies : if true , this means that these absorbers are biased tracers of the higher  density regions of space , and that agglomerations of strong absorbers along a line of sight are indicators of clusters and superclusters .",
    "however , richards  ( 1999 ) have recently claimed that there may be evidence in the data catalogs that the number of  absorbers along the line of sight depends on the intrinsic properties of the qso .",
    "these authors argue that there may be a significant contamination of true intervening systems along the line of sight by absorbers that are actually associated with the qso , and that such a contamination may extend to relative velocities as great as 75000  from the qso . in this work",
    ", we have adopted the standard cutoff and excluded absorbers that are closer than 5000 to the qso ( @xcite ; this corresponds to comoving distances of about 30  in this work ) .",
    "it is possible that such a contamination is present in the large  scale excess @xmath96 in figure  2 .",
    "a more detailed analysis of this possible effect will require an indicator capable of distinguishing , at least statistically , associated absorption ",
    "line systems from true intervening ones .",
    "while the exact nature of this large  scale excess is still uncertain , its existence on scales of 20  has been unambiguously revealed by the present analysis .",
