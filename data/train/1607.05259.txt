    "the fact that two - photon states generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) are entangled in transverse spatial modes with high schmidt numbers opens a possibility of encoding information in two - photon states using larger alphabets @xcite . to this end",
    ", it is of importance to understand whether the transverse mode correlation is still present in any extent after the down - converted two - photon states have propagated through a turbulent medium . among the many possible sets of orthogonal higher - order optical beam modes , the best known are the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) and hg modes .",
    "lg modes are of particular interest as their helical phase front structures carry orbital angular momentum ( oam)@xcite . due to this complex spatial distribution , lg modes",
    "can not be efficiently coupled to single - mode fibers . in order to detect higher - order modes ,",
    "computer generated holograms shall be used to transform the higher - order modes to the zero - order ones which are further coupled to single - mode fibers @xcite .",
    "computer generated holograms can also be used to project superposition states of lg modes to a particular state defined by the hologram necessary for verification of entanglement @xcite . as the hologram and the single mode fiber configuration is sensitive to the radial distribution of the source ( characterized by the mode number @xmath0 ) ,",
    "measurements of only the spiral spectrum of entangled two - photon states have been carried out @xcite . in the presence of turbulence ,",
    "the evolution of entanglement in the three dimensional lg mode basis has been observed using a single phase screen model for one of the photons , either signal or idler @xcite .",
    "recently , an experiment on transmission of oam modes of light over a distance of 143 kilometers has been performed @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric fourth - order correlation function for the spdc process , when the field of pump represents any of hg or lg modes as well as a partially coherent field has been calculated analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that the joint probability for detection of the signal and idler photons in different positions is considerable after propagation for more than five kilometers . in this letter",
    ", we go a step forward and calculate the joint probability to detect the photons in different hg modes ( see eq .",
    "( [ final_expression ] ) ) which is a product of functions , which mixes the indices of signal and idler implying that the entanglement is preserved .",
    "our results also show that some pairs of modes are more robust to the crosstalk due to atmospheric propagation than others which can be beneficial for free space quantum communication purposes .",
    "full spatial entanglement has been accessed experimentally with feasible radial detection modes with negligible cross correlations in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the expected perfectly ( anti)correlated pure state from spdc has the form @size8@mathfonts @@@#1 @xmath1 where the coefficients @xmath2 are the probability amplitudes to detect a signal photon in the @xmath3 mode and an idler photon in the @xmath4 mode .",
    "in contrast to the azimuthal modes , their radial counterparts do not necessarily represent schmidt modes , however , there has been found non - zero quantum correlations of detected modes with different @xmath0 @xcite . instead of the basis of the lg modes , mathematically",
    ", it is less costly to make use of the hg modes .",
    "as the hg modes form a complete set , one can expand the two - photon state as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the state prepared in spdc process and @xmath7 are the coefficients of expansion representing the probability amplitudes of detecting signal and idler photons in hg modes with mode indexes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the joint detection probability , @xmath10 , for signal and idler photons each in some transverse mode propagating in vacuum has been calculated before @xcite .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we write the joint probability for two photons in modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in the representation of the configuration space variables which facilitates accounting for the atmospheric effects on the state @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the two - photon state generated by spdc @xcite , while @xmath15 represents the two photon wavefunction . experimentally , the modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent phase holograms , say , to be coupled with a detection system . the frequency degenerate spdc state is of our specific interest , that is , @xmath18 expression ( [ prob_transverse_modes ] ) is independent of positions of detectors due to the fact that the fields , whose modal expansion is made up of arbitrary weighted hg modes , are shape - invariant @xcite .",
    "the shape - invariant property will no longer hold due to distortions caused by turbulence .",
    "the two photon wavefunction @xmath19 thus can be taken in the far field approximation important for calculating the probability ( [ prob_transverse_modes ] ) by taking the effects of turbulence into account .",

    "@xmath61    fig.[fig1 ] shows that forbidden probabilities , imposed by the selection rules ( [ selection - rules ] ) , increase due to the crosstalk between modes caused by atmosphere .",
