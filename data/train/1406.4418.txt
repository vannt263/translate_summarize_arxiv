    "<S> the price to pay for such a high rate of secret key generation is that the accessible information criterion does not guarantee unconditional and composable security . </S>",
    "<S> our protocol guarantees composable security under the assumption that alice and bob know that the coherence time of eve s quantum memory is no larger than @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , the key generation rate is independent on the value of @xmath36 , as long as alice and bob know this value ( though large values of @xmath36 would make the protocol unpractical ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one should also ensure that the qdl is robust under leakage to eve of a small fraction of the key or the message . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as a small key allows one to ( un)lock a disproportionate amount of information , it could very well happen that the leakage to eve of a few bits may allow her to uncover a much larger portion of the message . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has been recently addressed in  @xcite , where it is shown that there exist qdl protocols that can be made resilient to loss of a given amount of information by increasing the secret key consumption by a proportional amount . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions of  @xcite may be straightforwardly generalized to the protocol discussed here , and hence applied to guarantee the robustness of our qdl protocol for noisy channels .    </S>",
    "<S> the qdl states and unitaries in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ft ] ) and  ( [ uphase ] ) are particularly suitable for quantum optics applications , where a qudit can be encoded by coherently splitting a single photon over @xmath0 modes ( e.g. , path , temporal , linear momentum , orbital angular momentum ) and then by applying i.i.d .  </S>",
    "<S> random phases to the different modes by modulating an array of phase shifters . </S>",
    "<S> for example , this kind of transformation can be implemented by group velocity dispersion and our protocol can be realized by a simple modification of standard @xmath0-dimensional quantum key distribution protocols , see e.g. ,  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in  @xcite this requires passive linear optical transformations and photo detection . in the unary encoding of a single photon over @xmath0 modes , </S>",
    "<S> linear losses are modeled by a qudit erasure channel , and the depolarizing channel model provides a standard benchmark for assessing the performance of quantum key distribution . </S>",
    "<S> different channel models reflect different collective attacks conducted by the eavesdropper . </S>",
    "<S> while the final key generation rate may depend on the channel model , the security of our qdl protocol ( which holds in the strong locking sense ) does not depend on the details of the channel , and it also holds in the case of coherent attacks . </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us remark that unlike previous qdl protocols the one presented here does not require @xmath0 to be arbitrarily large . </S>",
    "<S> instead , our protocol requires an increasing number of channel uses ( as typical of i.i.d .  information theory ) while it is sufficient to assume @xmath38 .    _ </S>",
