    "gliomas as a group are the most frequent type of primary brain tumors . with few unfrequent exceptions",
    "aside , these tumors remain a challenge for medicine since therapies can not eradicate them due to their infiltrative nature .",
    "patients diagnosed with gliomas typically die because of the complications related to the tumor evolution .",
    "low grade glioma ( lgg ) is a term used to describe who grade ii primary brain tumors of astrocytic and/or oligodendroglial origin @xcite .",
    "they represent a subgroup of gliomas with moderate incidence that are diagnosed mostly in young adults .",
    "these tumors have a slow growth but are highly infiltrative and generally incurable , the median survival time being of about @xmath0 years @xcite .",
    "while some patients present with easy to control seizures and remain stable for many years , others undergo soon the so called malignant transformation and progress rapidly , with increasing neurological symptoms , to a higher - grade tumor .",
    "management of lgg is controversial because many of these patients present few , if any , neurological symptoms .",
    "recent evidences support that the early use of surgery results in a better outcome than the historically used watch and wait approach @xcite .    the decision as to whether a patient with lgg should receive resection , radiation therapy ( rt ) , or chemotherapy",
    "is based on a number of factors including age , performance status , location of tumor , and patient preference @xcite .",
    "since lggs are such a heterogeneous group of tumors with variable natural histories , the risks and benefits of each therapy must be carefully balanced with the data available .    as to rt , the clinical trial by @xcite showed the advantage of using radiotherapy in addition to surgery . however , the timing of radiotherapy after biopsy or debulking is debated @xcite .",
    "it is now well known that immediate radiotherapy after surgery increases the time of response ( progression - free survival ) , but does not seem to improve overall survival @xcite . at the same time the therapy induces serious neurological deficits as a result to normal brain damage .",
    "thus , radiotherapy is usually offered to patients with a combination of poor risk factors such as age , sub - total resection , or diffuse astrocytoma pathology @xcite or those suspicious of having undergone the malignant transformation .",
    "mathematical modeling has the potential to help in selecting lggs patients that may benefit from radiotherapy and in developing specific optimal fractionation schemes for selected patient subgroups .",
    "the increasing availability of systematic and quantitative measurements of tumor growth rates provides bench examples and typical features of the dynamics providing key information for the development and validation of such models ( see e.g. @xcite for lggs ) .    most of the mathematical research on gliomas has been focused on the study of high - grade gliomas @xcite .",
    "most of these models add different layers of complexity on top of the basic fisher - kolmogorov reaction diffusion equation @xcite to be described in detail later .",
    "the role of radiotherapy has also been studied mostly o high - grade tumors @xcite . as to lggs",
    "there have been very few relevant works using mathematical models to describe the response to rt .",
    "@xcite developed a model based on ordinary differential equations describing the response of low - grade glioma to different therapies with a number of undetermined parameters that can be fit to describe the individual patient s response with a good qualitative agreement .",
    "more recently @xcite have developed a simple spatial model able to describe the known phenomenology of the response of lggs to rt including the observations from @xcite .",
    "also @xcite have found that small variations of the standard dose distributions and/or changes in the fractionation lead only to minor improvements at the best , in agreement with clinical experiences .",
    "however it is not clear from the biological point of view that current scheduling of radiotherapy is optimal considered from a more global point of view .",
    "the fact that radiation doses are given in a very short period of time ( i.e. one dose per day during five weeks with breaks in the weekends ) comes from the idea of reducing the tumor load as much as possible in order to kill every clonogenic cell without allowing the tumor to regrow between doses .",
    "while this is a reasonable practice when radiation therapy is used with curative intentions , it is not obvious that an incurable tumor such as a lgg should receive doses in the same way .",
    "indeed lgg grow very slowly , with a very low number of mitoses seen per field what means that only a small fraction of tumor cells is proliferating at a given time and is sensitive to radiation therapy .",
    "thus , it may be reasonable to enlarge the distance between fractions , i.e. to restort to a protracted therapeutical scheme , to allow for more tumor cells to enter the cell cycle rendering radiation fractions more effective .",
    "this idea opens the door to substantially modified schedules that will be studied using mathematical models in this paper .",
    "our plan in this paper is as follows .",
    "first in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present the mathematical models to be used through the paper .",
    "next in sec .",
    "[ results ] we find the optimal therapeutical protocols and discuss the expected gain as a function of the parameters .",
    "explicit formulas are found providing the spacing between doses as a function of the biological parameters of the tumor in very good agreement with the results of full three - dimensional simulations . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we discuss the implications of our results and summarize our conclusions .",
    "to fix the mathematical model we have to describe what is : ( i ) the dynamics of the tumor , ( ii ) the response of the tumor to radiation , and ( iii ) the optimization criterion to be used in designing the dose scheduling .      for",
    "the tumor cell dynamics we will use the simplest model accounting for the growth of a spatio - temporal density @xmath1 of tumor cells in units of a maximal cell number that proliferate with a typical time @xmath2 and have a characteristic mobility ( diffusion ) coefficient @xmath3 , namely the fisher - kolmogorov equation @xcite    [ conc ] @xmath4 on a domain @xmath5 of the brain supplemented with initial data @xmath6 and no - flux boundary conditions @xmath7    this model has been extensively used to describe the dynamics of low grade gliomas @xcite .",
    "let us note ( see e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an upper bound for the tumor amplitude solving @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to providing an upper bound for the tumor cell density , eq .",
    "( [ sim ] ) has also been proven to provide the evolution of the tumor amplitude @xmath12 with good accuracy in one - dimensional scenarios @xcite .",
    "since we will be dealing with low grade gliomas the focus of the therapy will be on limiting disease symptoms and delaying the most its transformation into a higher - grade tumor .",
    "it has been discussed that high density cell foci may lead to tumor transformation @xcite , thus , in this paper we will first focus on understanding and controlling the dynamics of eq . in secs . [",

    "next , in sec .",
    "[ results:3d ] we will complete our study with a comparison of our findings with the results for the full dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ conc ] ) in three - dimensional scenarios .",
    "radiotherapy is given in a short time ( typically about 10 minutes ) in comparison with typical cellular proliferation times in low - grade gliomas , what allows us to assume the effect of rt to be instantaneous .",
    "following the standard practice in radiotherapy we will assume the damaged fraction of tumor cells to be given by the classical linear - quadratic ( lq ) model @xcite .",
    "thus for a radiation dose @xmath13 given at a time @xmath14 , we will take the survival fraction @xmath15 , i.e. the fraction of cells that are not lethally damaged to be given by @xmath16 the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the linear and quadratic coefficients for _ tumor _ cell damage of the lq model .",
    "the full treatment consists of a total dose @xmath3 split in a series of @xmath19 radiation fractions with doses per fraction @xmath20 given at irradiation times @xmath21 .",
    "the tumor cell density of functionally alive tumor cells @xmath1 at the irradiation times will then satisfy @xmath22 what reflects directly on a similar equation for the tumor amplitude @xmath9 : @xmath23      damage to normal tissues caused by radiotherapy can be estimated using eq . but taking instead the parameters of the normal tissue @xmath24 with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable that any radiotherapy fractionation should keep the damage to the normal tissue equal or below that of the standard fractionation , what can be quantified , given a certain set of doses @xmath26 as ( see e.g. @xcite pp .",
    "@xmath27 = \\alpha_h \\left(d + \\frac{1}{\\alpha_h/\\beta_h } \\sum_{j=1}^n d^2_j\\right).\\ ] ]    in addition , acute tissue reactions and other secondary effects depend : ( i ) on the total volume irradiated ( the so - called volume effect ) and ( ii ) on the maximal dose per fraction @xmath28 used",
    ". we will not be interested in this paper on spatial aspects of radiation therapy or other complications @xcite and thus will assume that all tumor cells within the tumor receive the same ammount of radiation .",
    "mathematical optimization has the potential to help in finding optimal therapeutic schedules , spatial dose distributions , etc .",
    "to do so once a particular tumor evolution model has been chosen and paired with a model for the response to radiation we must choose a cost functional related to the optimization objective .",
    "in the case of high grade brain tumors , where there is no metastatic spreading it has been hypothesized that death occurs in high grade tumors after the tumor reaches a critical diameter of about 6 - 7 cm @xcite . however , high grade gliomas are very aggressive tumors that due to the formation of necrotic areas result is a complete loss of functionality in areas affected by macroscopic tumor @xcite .    in lggs",
    "the situation is different . because of the low density of the tumor the tissue affected is still partially functional and the slow tumor growth allows the brain to remap",
    "continuously the affected functionality into healthy brain areas .",
    "the most harmful effect of the lgg is its potential to transform into a high - grade tumor .",
    "so the optimal therapy would be the one delaying the most the malignant transformation of the tumor while at the same time helping to keep the disease symptoms under control .",
    "one of the driving forces of the malignant transformation is an increase of mutation rates originated by the changes in tumor microenvironment due to the continuous density increase .",
    "these include vessel damage , generation of hypoxic foci , the stabilization of hypoxia dependent signaling molecules such as hif-1@xmath29 and the increase of genomic instability @xcite .",
    "thus , we will design the therapy to maintain the tumor density below a critical level @xmath30 for the longest time possible , i.e. , to make the time @xmath31 such that @xmath32 as large as possible .",

    "( [ isoeffect ] ) is a mathematical optimization problem that can be solved for the number of doses @xmath19 , irradiation times @xmath34 and doses @xmath35 .",

    "( [ t2 ] ) as the time to malignant transformation ( tmt ) .    in this paper we will not study the full optimization problem and",
    "our focus will be on demonstrating a theoretical proof of concept of the extreme protaction strategy for lggs , thus grounding mathematically a radically different approach to the planning of radiotherapy for lggs .",
    "as such we will fix the number of radiation doses and doses per fraction to be exactly those of the most extended radiotherapy protocols for these tumors , i.e. take the number of fractions @xmath36 and doses per fraction @xmath37 gy , what keeps the value of the functional @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ isoeffect ] ) and satisfies the restriction that @xmath39 gy .",
    "our only optimization parameter will be then the time spacing between doses .      in the problem to be studied in this paper there",
    "remain few biological parameters describing at a macroscopic level the essentials of the lgg dynamics and response to therapy .",
    "first , proliferation rates for lggs have been estimated to be around 0.003 day@xmath40 in @xcite what gives doubling times of the order of one year . from the most indolent tumors to those more aggressive within the class of lggs the full range may comprise an order of magnitude .",
    "the surviving fraction @xmath41 for doses of 1.8 gy is harder to estimate .",
    "it is known that gliomas are very radioresistant tumors with high surviving fractions in - vitro and mixed response to radiation in - vivo .",
    "we will follow the approach of @xcite that estimate this value from the radiological response fitting the typically observed dynamics of the mean tumor diameter @xcite what gives values in the range @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the tumor cell densities leading to relevant symptoms and disease detection ( @xmath43 ) and the threshold density beyond which harmful symptoms appear and/or promoting the malignant transformation ( @xmath30 ) , are difficult to estimate .",
    "normal brain tissue has low cellularity and the cell density leading to symptoms is probably dependent on the location of origin of the tumor .",
    "however , most lggs are supratentorial and appear in the white matter .",
    "we will take the initial density to be around @xmath44 what means that symptoms arise when 30% of the space is occupied by tumor cells , a number well beyond the normal physiological value that may be around 10 - 15% .",

    "while it is clear that within the framework of our model the choice for the spacing between doses @xmath83 will lead to a longer time to the malignant transformation than the customary choice @xmath84 day , it is interesting to quantify this improvement in lifetime quantitatively .",

    "( [ td ] ) ( e.g. the ones depicted in fig .",
    "[ comparisont ] ) , but still substantial and about one year for the two sets of parameters studied .",
    "both the three - dimensional data and the bounds are very close for values of @xmath65 close to the optimal ones . what it is more interesting is that the value for @xmath65 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ optfin ] ) predict very accurately the correct optimal values of the optimal dose interspacing found from the full three - dimensional simulations .",
    "it is remarkable that such a simple formula can provide the optimal values for",
    "in this paper we have found simple equations providing the optimal dose interspacing in radiotherapy protocols for low - grade gliomas , under the assumptions of equal doses per fraction and fixed spacing between doses .",
    "the predictions are obtained within the framework of a simple model but have been found to have an excellent agreement with the numerical results from fully spatio - temporal three - dimensional mathematical models .    from the point of view of applications ,",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that it may be possible to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy as an upfront therapy for the management of low grade gliomas .",
    "specifically , the basics for improvement consists on enlarging substantially the interval between doses from the typical choice @xmath100 day to larger values obtained through eq .",
    "( [ optfin ] ) .",
    "thus , the results of sec . [ results ] provide a theoretical support for extremely protracted therapies for low grade gliomas .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the results have a very clear biological meaning .",
    "since tumor regrowth is known to be faster for small tumor densities , what it is called the _ accelerated repopulation _ phenomenon , it pays out to leave the tumor density grow while keeping its damage under control .",
    "our logistic growth term captures this phenomenon to some extent .",
    "indeed , the effect of radiation over a population of tumor cells with so - small fraction of proliferating cells would be minimal and thus a more effective way of using this therapy would be to delay fractions in time to hit new tumor subpopulations once they continue through the cell cycle . these effects , not accounted for in our model , may be incorporated by including two cell subpopulations , one quiescent and another proliferative coupled with the first one , i.e. a compartment of stem cells that in high grade glioma have a crucial role in the response to therapies @xcite    a relevant fact is that taking @xmath65 above the optimal value @xmath83 leads to a sharp drop of the gain in time to the malignant transformation and even a worse outcome than the choice @xmath84 ( see figs .",
    "[ rteffect ] and [ 3dfig ] ) .",
    "thus , to exploit the full power of our approach it may be necessary to have good estimates for the tumor proliferation @xmath101 and radiosensitivity @xmath41 parameters . in principle",
    "it may be possible to estimate those parameters from mri measurements of the response to a set of doses of radiation @xcite , thus a two - step strategy may be designed where a first batch of radiation doses ( e.g. one - two weeks ) are given intensively ( @xmath100 ) to treat sympthoms and characterize the tumor parameters from the response on mri and later the remaining set of fractions are given optimally according to the found tumor parameters @xmath102 .",
    "another possibility is to take conservative values of @xmath103 day that would lead to improvements , though non - optimal , for most tumors except for those very aggressive ( large @xmath101 ) and then in case of radiological confirmation of tumor control after some period of time ( e.g. one year ) enlarge the interval between fractions .    in this paper we have tried only to make a first approach to the problem through a proof of concept of the basic idea .",
    "further gains may be possible by solving the full optimization problem were the number of doses @xmath19 , treatment times @xmath14 and individual doses @xmath13 are variables to be choosen to maximize the malignant transformation time ( [ t2 ] ) . while the mathematical problem is interesting and we intend to address it in the future , complex strategies depending too much on the values system parameters might be difficult or even impossible to validate and implement due to parameter uncertainty and may have no impact on the clinical management of these tumors .",
    "thus we have opted for a simpler approach easier to validate in animal models and to translate into current clinical practice .    can the extreme protraction concept be exported to other therapies such as chemotherapy for low grade gliomas ?",
    "currently , the most used chemotherapeutical scheme consists of a week treatment ( an oral dose per day ) per month , being repeated for several cycles ( months ) .",
    "although this scheme is already more extended in time , there might be benefit either in enlarging the interval between cycles or in extending the interval between doses within a given cycle . since side effects in chemotherapy are systemic instead of mostly local for rt , different models and/or restrictions are to be used for that problem , that will be considered in the future .",
    "we hope our results will motivate research on animal models of low - grade gliomas and a further translation to the clinical practice if sucessful , on the benefit of patients of this lethal disease .",
