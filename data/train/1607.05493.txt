    "the notion of chaos control was introduced in @xcite , chaos control being the concept of stabilization of unstable periodic orbits of non - linear systems by small controlling impacts that however totally change the nature of the motion .",
    "the aim of such control is either synchronization of a chaotic motion or chaotization of a regular motion .",
    "later on several other methods of chaos control were suggested .",
    "the most popular turned out to be the dfc method by pyragas @xcite .",
    "the idea of the method is introduction of linear feedback with delay of the size of period .",
    "the pyragas method got its popularity in many respects due to its constructive simplicity .",
    "further , the method was developed and generalized in many papers , c.f .",
    "there are known other various approaches to control , e.g. @xcite-@xcite . however , each of them has significant deficiency @xcite .",
    "thus the problem of development of new methods of chaos control still remains .",
    "+ in @xcite , to stabilize periodic orbits the application of non - linear feedback with several delays of size proportional to the period were suggested . developing this methodology , in this paper",
    "is suggested a new method of solving the problem of optimal stabilization of cycles in families of discrete autonomous systems .",
    "this method involves mixing the previous stages of the system or functions of these stages . in particular cases the method of mixing coincides with control by means of delay feedback @xcite .",
    "+ _ the goal of this paper _ is a construction of algorithms of chaos suppression in non - linear discrete systems , based on a newly considered class of problems of physical principles .",
    "+ _ the issue _ is in the choice of structure and parameters of the control system , that locally stabilize a priori unknown cycles of given length .",
    "let us consider the vector nonlinear discrete system that without control has a form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a differentiable vector function of appropriate dimension .",
    "+ it is assumed that the system has invariant convex sets @xmath2 i.e. if @xmath3 then @xmath4 it is also assumed that this system has one or several unstable @xmath5 cycles @xmath6 , where all vectors @xmath7 are pairwise distinct and belongs to the invariant set @xmath2 i.e. @xmath8 . + the multipliers considered for the unstable cycles are determined as eigenvalues of a product of jacobi s matrices @xmath9 with @xmath10 dimension .",
    "+ it is required to construct the system @xmath11 where @xmath12 the goal of control is to make locally stable all ( or at least some ) @xmath5 cycles of the system .",
    "it is important that the convex set @xmath13 still invariant for the system as well , i.e. if vectors @xmath14 are contained in set a , then the vector @xmath15 is contained in the set @xmath13 too .",
    "this follows from the definition of the convex combination of the vectors . on a top of",
    "that the system has same @xmath16-cycles that is in the system . + a physical meaning of the control is in the following :",
    "the expression @xmath17 can be interpreted as inside mixing of system states @xmath18 while the expression @xmath19 can be interpreted as outside mixing .",
    "thus , + @xmath20 is a combined mixing . note that control with outside mixing is equivalent to the delayed feedback control @xcite .",
    "+ let us apply the following linearization to construct jacobi matrices for the system and its characteristic equation .",
    "this scheme was justified in @xcite .",
    "+ it is clear that @xmath21 solution of the system ( 3 ) can be written in the form @xmath22 let us substitute the solution ( 4 ) in ( 3 ) assuming that values @xmath23 are so small in the neighborhood of a cycle that the assumptions of the theorem by first approximation is valid @xcite .",
    "+ let @xmath24 . then @xmath25 separating the linear part and given that @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 the system ( 5 ) is linear therefore the solutions are exponents , i.e. @xmath29 that after substitution in ( 5 ) give us a system @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is identity matrix and @xmath33 is a null matrix of dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "+ the standard methods of analyzing @xmath16-cycle stability is verification that the location of all zeros of the determinant of system ( 7 ) is in the central unit disc of the complex plane @xmath34 . in our case",
    "the determinant of system ( 7 ) is equal to @xmath35 where @xmath36 are eigenvalues of matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath16-cycle stability condition of system ( 2 ) is a requirement that all roots of the equation @xmath38 are in the central unit circle .",
    "corresponding , the problem of chaos control in system ( 1 ) by mixing values of system s state and function of this values in previous moments of time is formulated in the follwing way : _ for given cycle length @xmath16 and given set of multipliers localization define the coefficients of inside mixing @xmath39 , and outside mixing @xmath40 , such that cycle of length @xmath16 will be locally asymptotically stable ; the magnitude of using prehistory should be minimum possible .",
    "_    in other words , in equation ( 8) it is necessary to find the coefficients @xmath41 such that all roots of this equation lie in the central unit circle , and the value @xmath42 should be the minimum possible .",
    "+ clearly , the solution of problem depends on the localization of multipliers @xmath43 .",
    "+ we will consider two possibilities : either all multipliers are real @xmath44 or are in the left half - plane @xmath45 for each of these cases the algorithm of finding minimum @xmath42 and optimal coefficients @xmath46 consists of the following steps @xcite :    * compute nodes : @xmath47 in the case @xmath48 we let @xmath49 , while in the case @xmath50 we let @xmath51 ; * construct auxiliary polynomials @xmath52 @xmath53 * compute coefficients of auxiliary polynomials @xmath54 * construct optimal coefficients @xmath55 * in case @xmath56 compute values @xmath57^{t},\\;\\mbox{$n$ even}\\ ] ] @xmath58^{t},\\ ; \\mbox{$n$ odd};\\ ] ] the optimal value of @xmath42 is computed as minimal positive integer that satisfies the inequality @xmath59 ; * in case @xmath50 compute values @xmath60^{t},\\;\\mbox{$n$ even},\\ ] ] @xmath61^{t},\\;\\mbox{$n$ odd;}\\ ] ] the optimal value of @xmath42 is computed as minimal positive integer that satisfies the inequality @xmath62 .",
    "if the optimal coefficients are found then the mixing coefficients can be found from the system ( 6 ) , which can be conveniently written as @xmath63 if we add normalization condition than the system takes the form",
    "@xmath64 let us note that the optimal coefficients are determined uniquely while mixing coefficients are not necessary unique .",
    "let us consider a few examples .",
    "+ let @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 - kroneker s symbol . then ,",
    "from ( 9 ) we get @xmath68 .",
    "the system ( 2 ) takes the form @xmath69 the system is controlling by the outside mixing @xcite .",
    "+ let @xmath70 , then @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the system ( 2 ) takes the form @xmath74 the system is controlling by inside mixing .",
    "+ let @xmath75 ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 ; @xmath76 , @xmath73 ; @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath73 , @xmath80 .",
    "then the system ( 2 ) takes the form @xmath81 we determine the optimal values of coefficients of outside mixing @xmath82 . in this case",
    "the system ( 9 ) takes the form    @xmath83 the general solution of this system is represented as the sum of the partial solution of the inhomogeneous system and the general solution of the homogeneous system @xmath84 given that @xmath85 , @xmath80 , we get @xmath86 . finally the system ( 2 ) takes the form @xmath87 where @xmath86 .",
    "the system is controlled with help of combined mixing .",
    "when @xmath88 we do outside mixing , when @xmath89 we do inside mixing .",
    "the systems appears e.g. in diffusion chaos theory , c.f . @xcite .",
    "in this section we will focus on the possibility of controlling the chaos by stabilizing @xmath90-cycles with mixing , determined by the dynamic system ( 2 ) , @xmath91 .",
    "each point @xmath16-cycle is a fixed point of the @xmath16-iterated mapping @xmath92 : @xmath93 the problem of the cycle stability is reduced to the question of the fixed points stability of the mapping @xmath94 , that generates the cycle of length @xmath16 .",
    "note , that the value of cycle multiplier does not depend on the choice of the fixed point that is included in the considered cycle , and that the fixed points of the mapping @xmath94 are also fixed points of the mapping @xmath95 , if @xmath96 with @xmath97 being an integer .",
    "thus , the problem of stabilization of @xmath16-cycles of system ( 1 ) can be reduced to the problem of stabilization of @xmath16-cycles for the system @xmath98 mixing will be organized as following . + the mixing of the first level : @xmath99    then the mixing of the second level : @xmath100    then the mixing of the third level : @xmath101    the mixing of the higher levels is determined similarly .",
    "+ thus , the control system for the stabilization of cycle length @xmath16 is represented as the following @xmath102 in the system ( 10 ) , all coefficients have to satisfy the normalization conditions , thus define the convex combinations .",
    "+ the mixing coefficients can be considered as components of tensors . to stabilize cycles of length @xmath16",
    "the control system should consist of @xmath103 levels of mixing , the outside level is determined by the vector of the mixing coefficients of the @xmath104 dimension , the next level is determined by the mixing coefficients matrix of the @xmath105 dimension , etc .",
    "each level is determined by the tensor of the corresponding order coefficients .",
    "all tensors must satisfy the folding conditions , in which sequential folding of the coefficients tensors from the first mixing level to @xmath106 level should give a vector of optimal coefficients @xmath107 it is clear that the optimal mixing coefficients are determined not always in one way .",
    "for example , one possible system of stabilization of the cycle length @xmath108 can be the system @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "note important differences between the stabilization method considered in this paper and the most known methods .",
    "control is applied at all points in time , and not just in a neighborhood of the desired cycle  _ the cycle to know in advance is not necessary_. moreover , our control allows to stabilize at once all cycles of a given length with multipliers lying in the left half - plane , real or complex . to stabilize the specific cycle is sufficient for the sequence of initial points to lie in the basin of attraction of this cycle .",
    "different initial sequence will generate sequences of solutions converging to the different cycles of a given length .",
    "one of the possible applications of the proposed method is to check the existence of periodic orbits of a given nonlinear mapping , the unstable orbits can be detected by their stabilization .",
    "consider the mapping @xcite @xmath111 generating a dynamic system of `` sudden occurrence of chaos '' ( soc ) @xmath112 in @xcite to stabilize ( locate ) the cycles of lengths from 1 to 6 the predictive control @xcite was used .",

    "+ for the system ( 11 ) the invariant set is @xmath113;$ ] the equilibrium is point @xmath114 + let us find 3-cycle of system ( 11 ) . to do that",
    "let us consider the control system @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "figure 1 - dynamics of solutions of system ( 12 ) in @xmath117 and in @xmath118 planes .",
    "we can see that system ( 12 ) has two equilibrium positions : @xmath119 and @xmath120 the first equilibrium position is the equilibrium position for the original system ( 11 ) , but the second defines a 3-cycle system of the system ( 11 ) : @xmath121 .",
    "+ similarly , we can find the 7-cycle system ( 11 ) .",

    "there is a locally stable equilibrium position , which is also the equilibrium position of the original system ( 11 ) , and a locally stable 3-cycle @xmath132 .",

    "suppose , for example , one needs to find cycles of length 15 .",
    "we choose several starting points and consider their dynamics in accordance with the equation @xmath138 take 400 iterations of this system , and in step 401 we start the mixing process ( 12 ) . in this case",
