    "detailed imaging of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) of seyfert galaxies with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has revealed its complex morphology and velocity field .",
    "recently , observations of ngc 4151 indicated the presence of emitting clouds with velocities ranging from + 846 to -1716 ( winge et al .",
    "1997 , kaiser et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "ngc 4151 is a nearby barred galaxy , usually classified as a seyfert type 1 , although it has already been considered as a seyfert 1.5 ( osterbrock & koski 1976 ) and has also shown the characteristics of a seyfert 2 galaxy ( penston & prez 1984 ) .",
    "ngc 4151 is one of the most observed active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , from radio to x - rays .",
    "the recent hst longslit emission - line data ( nelson et al . 2000 ) , coupled to iso data ( alexander et al . 1999 ) , offer an excelent opportunity to improve our understanding of the nlr physical conditions with the added effect of the velocity field .",
    "the kinematics derived from the long slit observations ( nelson et al .",
    "2000 , crenshaw et al .",
    "2000 ) show evidence of three components : a low velocity system , consistent with normal disk rotation , a high velocity system in radial outflow at a few hundred and an additional high velocity system with velocities up to 1400 , as previously found from stis slitless spectroscopy ( hutchings et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 , kaiser et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the authors see the signature of a radial outflow , with no interaction with the radio jet .",
    "however , high velocity components , shifted up to about 1500  from the systemic velocity , are also seen by winge et al ( 1997 ) associated with individual clouds located preferentially along the edges of the radio knots .",
    "such association suggests a cloud - jet interaction , which definitively may influence the morphology and the physical conditions of the nlr .",
    "the high spatial resolution permits to see that the emission line ratios vary substantially on scales of a few tenth of an arcsecond , indicating that the density and ionization state of the emitting gas are strongly influenced by the local conditions , hence suggesting that shock fronts may be at work .",
    "the presence of high velocity clouds in the nlr of active galaxies has been predicted from the modeling of the emission - line and continuum spectra of the seyfert 2 objects ngc 5252 and circinus ( contini , prieto & viegas 1998a , 1998b ) , as well as suggested from the more general analysis of the optical - ultraviolet continuum of a relatively large sample of seyfert 2 galaxies ( contini & viegas 2000 ) .",
    "high velocity clouds are also invoked in an alternative model based on a multiwavelength analysis of the emission - line and continuum spectra of the source ( contini & viegas 1999 ) , which explains the soft x - ray excess in ngc 4051 .    in all of these models",
    "the physical conditions of the high velocity clouds are usually shock - dominated .",
    "the shocks contribute to the high ionization emission - lines and to the continuum emission , mainly by providing efficient heating of dust , contributing to reproduce the observed middle - infrared emission , and to the observed soft x - ray spectrum which originates in the high temperature post - shock zone .",
    "yet , the interpretation of the ngc 4151 emission - line and continuum spectra is so far residing exclusively on photoionization models .",
    "all the authors agree that , given the simplicity of the models , the observed line ratios can be reproduced .    in ngc 4151",
    "the high velocity clouds are directly observed .",
    "velocities of @xmath1 1500  could be theoretically explained extrapolating to the nlr the arguments about high velocity clouds raised by weymann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . here , however , in order to obtain a large range of velocities collisions are invoked .",
    "although photoionization models reproduce within better than a factor of 2 the most important line ratios ( schulz 1988 , 1990 ; kraemer et al .",
    "2000 ; alexander et al .",
    "1999 ) , some questions remain still open , as for example the mere fact of the influence of the velocity field in the cloud spectrum .",
    "thus , in this paper we will look for the signature of the high velocity gas in the emission - line spectrum , as well as in the radio to x - rays continuum spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we present a new type of single - cloud modeling based on the spatial distribution of the observational data in the optical range ; then , a multi - cloud model is proposed to explain the emission lines in the ir .    as was done previously in modeling other objects ( ngc 5252 , circinus ) , the multi - cloud model issued from the analysis of the emission lines",
    "is then constrained by fitting the continuum sed in a large frequency range .",
    "this is possible only with composite models ( shock + photoionization ) , because the gas heated only by the radiation from the active center can not reach temperatures high enough to fit the bremsstrahlung emission and dust reradiation in the large range of the observed frequencies .",
    "a review focused in the successes and problems of photoionization models is presented in sect .",
    "the composite models , coupling photoionization and shocks , are described in sect .",
    "the optical emission - line spectrum is discussed in sect .",
    "4 , while the infrared lines are presented in sect . 5 , and",
    "the results for the ultraviolet lines appear in sect .",
    "the observed and calculated sed are compared in sect .",
    "7 , and the conclusions appear in sect .",
    "most recently , photoionization models for the nlr of ngc 4151 have been proposed by alexander et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and kraemer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the observed emission - line ratios are reproduced within a factor of 2 .",
    "both set of authors use , however , different modeling approach : the matter distribution adopted is different . in alexander s",
    "( 1999 ) models ( hereinfter called type a ) , the best fit is found with a single cloud component with a filling factor less than unity ; in kraemer s et al .",
    "( 2000 ) models ( type b ) , a multi- cloud is used , namely a less dense matter - bound component is added to a dense radiation - bounded component .",
    "we note that alexander et al .",
    "discarded this latter solution arguing that a matter - bounded component implies three free additional parameters , whereas the introduction of a filling factor their case implies only one .",
    "nevertheless , let us recall that a matter - bounded component favors the high ionization lines , while ( radiation - bounded ) models with filling - factor less than unity mimic a lower average density , leading to a larger ionized zone and favoring the low - ionization lines .",
    "thus , models assuming a filling factor less than unity are not a good physical representation of a clumpy zone ; yet , the spatial distribution of [ sii ] ratios across ngc 4151 extended emission line region reveals instead a rather clumpy region with regions of higher and lower density at different points along the hst slit ( nelson et al . 2000 ) . regarding both type",
    "a and type b models , the authors agree that `` the fit of the line ratios is good _ taking into account the simplicity of the models _ '' .",
    "simplicity has always been a strong argument in favor of photoionization models applied to nebular regions in agns , in addition to the undisputable presence of a strong central radiation source .",
    "however , in science it is usually from the attempt to explain the `` imperfections '' of a model , ( those data not explained by it ) , that a more realistic scenario can be drawn . with that in mind we list below the discrepancies between the above proposed photoionization models and the observational data of ngc 4151 .    due to the various difficulties to have a self - consistent data set ( data from different epoch , different resolutions and apertures ) , alexander et al .",
    "( 1999 ) use several criteria to select the set of emission - lines to be reproduced by type a models .",
    "one of the criteria excludes lines emitted by ions that _ `` can be easily ionized by other processes''_. the set of emission - lines excluded includes some usually used in the diagnostic diagrams of nebular gas : he ii 4686 , [ o iii ] 4363 , [ o i ] 6300 , [ n ii ] 6548 + 6584 and the density indicator [ sii ] 6716 , 6731 doublet , in addition to the high - ionization fe lines : [ fe x ] 6734 and [ fe xi ] 7892 .",
    "the final set of lines used for modeling , that includes uv , optical , and ir lines , is reproduced within a factor of 2 by their best fit models .",
    "discrepancies larger than two are derived for [ fe vii ] 5721 , [ fe vii ] 6086 , [ ne ii ] 12.8 and [ ne iii ] 36.0 which are underpredicted , and for [ s iii ] 9069 , [ ne v ] 14.3 , [ s iii ] 18.7 , [ ne v ] 24.3 , and [ s iii ] 33.5 that are overpredicted .    regarding the sed implied by models , the presence of a _ big blue bump _ in the ionizing radiation spectrum , peaking at 50 ev ,",
    "is excluded by their best - fit model because its effect would be _ to overproduce the low - ionization lines and underproduce the high - ionization lines_. however , this is the net effect produced by imposing a filling factor less than unity , as adopted in their best - fit model .",
    "kraemer et al . models ( type b ) use hst / stis low - dispersion long - slit data at position angle p.a .",
    "= 221@xmath2 .",
    "thus , their data set includes uv and optical lines , but no infrared lines that are the basis of type a models by alexander et al .",
    "their model results are compared with observed emission - line ratios derived at different positions along the slit .",
    "the large majority of the lines are reproduced within a factor of 2 .",
    "divergencies larger than 2 are often found for the high ionization lines : [ fe vii ] lines , and the uv lines n v 1240 , [ ne iv ] 2423 , and niv ] 1486 , although in the latter case the signal - to - noise is very low . at some locations of the emitting nebulae , the calculated c iii ] 1909 , cii ] 2326 , [ o iii ] 4363 , and",
    "the [ s iii ] lines also largely diverge from the data .",
    "notice , however , that ciii ] and cii ] are blended and that , in the case of the [ s iii ] lines the discrepancy may be due to an instrumental effect as pointed out by kraemer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "several interpretations for the above discrepancies are discussed by kraemer et al .",
    "our assumption is that those discrepancies may be revealing the presence of an additional ionizing mechanism , which is not the dominant process , but that shows its signature through particular observational features .",
    "this point of view is adopted here assuming that the additional mechanism is due to the presence of shocks .",
    "faint high velocity emission regions intermingled with brighter emission clouds are shown in ngc 4151 imaging ( hutchings et al .",
    "we consider this observational fact as an indication that the extended nlr of ngc 4151 is a mixture of low velocity radiation - dominated clouds and high velocity shock - dominated clouds , all contributing to the emission - line spectrum . accordingly",
    ", composite models accounting for the coupled effect of the central ionizing radiation and shock excitation due to cloud motions are assumed .",
    "numerical simulations for single clouds are obtained with the suma code ( see , for instance , viegas & contini 1994 ) .",
    "notice that the simulations apply whether the shocks originate from an interaction of the emitting clouds with the radio jet or from a radial outflow of the clouds .",
    "the input parameters are the shock velocity , , the preshock density , 0 , the preshock magnetic field , 0 , the ionizing radiation spectrum , the chemical abundances , the dust - to - gas ratio by number , d / g , and the geometrical thickness of the clouds , d. a power - law , characterized by the power index @xmath3 and the flux , , at the lyman limit , reaching the cloud ( in units of @xmath4 s@xmath5 ev@xmath5 ) is generally adopted . for all the models , 0 = @xmath6 gauss , @xmath7 = 1.5 , and @xmath8=0.4 , and cosmic abundances ( allen 1973 ) are adopted .",
    "the basic models are calculated with d / g = @xmath9 , however , this value is changed a posteriori to better fit the continuum sed .",
    "shock dominated models ( sd ) are calculated assuming that the effects of the shock prevail on radiation ( = 0 . ) .",
    "radiation dominated models ( rd ) , however , are composite , i.e. they account both for photoionization and shocks up to = 500 , but photoionization dominates the physical conditions of the emitting gas .    the grid of models which are actually used for modeling is presented in an accompanying paper by contini & viegas ( 2001 , hereafter referred to as cv01 ) . in the following ,",
    "calculated emission - line ratios from a selected number of models in the grid are compared to the hst log - slit optical data at p.a.= 221@xmath2 ( nelson et al .",
    "2000 and kraemer et al .",
    "2000 ) and to the iso integrated aperture sws data by sturm et al .",
    "models are selected on the basis of the physical conditions of the emitting gas dictated by the observations , e.g. the fwhm of the line profiles for .    in models which account for shock effects ,",
    "the density downstream is determined by compression , which depends on the shock velocity , and changes considerably with distance from the shock front ( cv01 , figs .",
    "5a , 6a , and 7a ) .",
    "therefore , the preshock density and the shock velocity chosen define a distribution of the density across the cloud , which must be adequate to provide a good fit to the density sensitive lines , e.g. , [ oii ] 3727 , [ ni ] 5200 , [ nii ] 6548 ( [ sii ] 6716 + is not very significant because s can be locked in dust grains ) .",
    "moreover , in the nlr the density of the clouds follows the gradient of the cloud velocity , decreasing with the distance to the center . for each cloud",
    ", the observed [ s ii ] 6717/6730 line ratio ( which does not depend on s / h ) is used as a first test for the choice of 0 and v@xmath10 .",
    "then , the intensity of the ionizing radiation , the physical conditions calculated by the model , and the geometrical thickness of the cloud are deduced from the line spectrum , as a whole .",
    "the [ o iii]/  line ratio is an indicator for .",
    "on the other hand , wide clouds are optically thick , leading to stronger low ionization level lines , while narrow clouds are matter - bounded , with fainter low - ionization lines .",
    "thus the choice of d is then constrained by the best fit of a large number of line ratios , particularly , the ratio of the low ionization lines to .",
    "_ modeling the spatial distribution _",
    "because of the availability of spatially resolved emission - line spectra in different regions of ngc 4151 , a new modeling approach is followed in this work .",
    "the most significant optical emission lines are modeled accounting for their spatial distribution across the nlr .    in each position we check the consistency of the prevailing models explaining several line ratios , including those that are poorly reproduced by the photoionization models .",
    "the observed and calculated emission - line intensities relative to  are presented in a series of figures ( figs .",
    "1 - 4 ) , where the emission - line ratios are shown as a function of the projected nuclear distance , including both the sw data ( on the left ) and the ne data ( on the right ) at p.a.= 221@xmath2 .    in order to determine the intensity of the power - law radiation flux in the nlr edge closer to the nucleus a preliminary estimate",

    "thin lines refer to a narrow cloud ( d=10@xmath11 cm ) and thick lines to wider clouds ( d = 10@xmath12 cm ) .",

    "the fit of both [ oiii]/  and [ oii]/  data is acceptable only in the bottom diagrams ( notice that in these diagrams the flux is not fully symmetric , indicating that the sw and ne regions are slightly different ) .",
    "so , for consistency we chose the bottom case to model also the other line ratios .    since we are investigating the intensity of ionizing radiation from the active center ( ac ) and the velocity distribution in the central region of ngc 4151 , both  and  are shown in figs . 2 - 4 diagrams . in this way",

    "1 . panels b and e show the solid lines corresponding to sd models ( cv01 , tables 1 - 10 ) for which the maximum value of the velocity distribution is = 700  in the central region , while diagrams c and f correspond to the results with a maximum velocity of = 1400 .    because shock dominated models for narrow and wide clouds",
    "give very similar results , these models are represented by one line ( model results overlap ) , corresponding to one serie of results .",
    "we draw attention to the thin and thick lines in the two bottom diagrams which refer to reduced and full intensity line ratios , respectively , and not to models calculated by small and large d , as shown in the top diagrams .",
    "the model results shown in figs .",
    "2 - 4 cover most of the data consistently for the [ oiii ] 5007 + 4959/ , [ oii ] 3727/ , [ oi ] 6300 + 6363/ , [ siii ] 9069/ , [ sii ] 6713 + 6731/ , and [ fevii ] 6086/  line ratios .",
    "the first three ratios are related to the ionization state of the gas , while the other three are chosen because they are not well reproduced by pure photoionization models .",
    "the ranges and the spatial distributions of  were chosen phenomenologically by the fit , particularly , of the [ oiii]/  and [ siii]/  ratios , while the ranges and the distributions of  were chosen by fitting the low ionization ( [ oii]/ , [ sii]/ ) and neutral ( [ oi]/ ) line ratios .",
    "the data corresponding to the high ionization line ratio [ fevii]/  are not enough to constrain the models .",
    "we adopt a velocity field decreasing from the center of the galaxy outwards .",
    "the observed velocity field is , however , complex , so , two different shock velocity distributions are shown , one with a maximum @xmath1 700  in the central region ( middle diagrams ) , and another with a higher maximum , up to 1400  ( bottom diagrams ) .",
    "two different lines represent the sd models in both middle and bottom diagrams .",
    "the thick one corresponds to the calculated models , the thin one to the models downwards shifted by a factor of 3 ( middle diagrams ) and of 2 ( bottom diagrams ) .",
    "the shift in the middle diagram is dictated by the fit of the [ oi]/  ratios ( see sect 4.1 ) and in the bottom diagram by the [ fevii]/  ratios ( see sect .",
    "these shifts do not represent lower abundances of the elements relative to h , but they indicate that in a multi - cloud model corresponding to the weighted sum of single - cloud models , the weights of the sd high velocity ( @xmath13 300 ) clouds is reduced ( see sect .",
    "5 ) . indeed",
    ", by modeling the data on a large scale , this solution may look arbitrary , particularly considering faint lines ( e.g. [ oi ] ) , and lines affected by the presence of dust ( e.g. [ siii ] , [ sii ] , etc . ) .",
    "if reducing the weights of the sd models , the fit of all the emission - lines is consistently improved , we can conclude that this reduction is sound and sd models corresponding to high velocities in the nuclear region have lower weights .",
    "the relative weight accounts for the relative number of clouds in the conditions determined by the model , for the dilution factor ( i.e. , the square ratio between the distance of the cloud from the galaxy center ) and the distance of the galaxy from earth .",
    "notice that the middle and bottom diagrams in figs .",
    "2 - 4 refer to `` high velocities '' in the nuclear region of the galaxy ( between 1500 - 700 and about 300 ) .",
    "indeed , nelson et al ( 2000 , fig .",
    "5 ) show that the bulk of cloud velocities is within 300 .",
    "so , the reduction of the weights in the sd diagrams indicates that the number of high velecity sd clouds is small .",
    "recall that observational data result from the integration along the line of sight , which may include different clouds .",
    "thus , a more realistic fit should be obtained by a multi - cloud average ( see sect .",
    "a compromise between a consistent picture over a large spatial distribution of several emission lines and the precision of the fit must be achieved .",
    "_ observed features _    in several cases there are two or more emission lines within the passband , so that different velocities are sampled for the different lines ( hutchings et al .",
    "these are the [ oii ] 3727 and [ sii ] doublets , as well as [ nii ] lines plus h@xmath3 at about 6548  .",
    "the [ oiii ] image covers velocities between -1200 and -860 .",
    "high velocity material in this velocity range is much fainter than the main bright clouds showing low velocities .",
    "it is seen on both sides of the nucleus and outside the main biconical emission regions .",
    "the high velocity gas is weak in h@xmath14 and [ oii ] lines and seems to be associated with highly ionized material .",
    "ionization of oxygen is higher along radial locations on both sides of the nucleus .",
    "generally , there is an association of high velocity clouds with high ionization gas , however , there are regions of high ionization ( mainly to the e side ) with no known high velocity gas .",
    "nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) claim that the high velocity components generally account for a small fraction of the total flux in the [ oiii ] emission lines . in several cases",
    "they find clouds with multiple velocity components .",

    "different models are selected to fit the data as expected from the multiple structure of the observed lines ( kaiser et al .",
    "2000 ) . as shown in fig .",

    "2 a ) with velocities of 200 - 300  contribute preferentially in the inner 1 arcsec region , while those with velocities of 100  appear at larger distances from the center , in agreement with winge et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "the contribution to [ oiii]/  line ratios from rd clouds with @xmath1 500  is small .    regarding the sd clouds ( fig .",
    "2 b and c ) , the high velocity ones ( @xmath13 500 ) are responsible for only a few percent of the central region emission , while a larger contribution at 3  from the center comes from the low velocity clouds ( @xmath15 500 ) .",
    "the situation is markedly different regarding [ oii]/  ( figs .",

    "the trend of [ oii]/  is nicely explained by sd models with  between @xmath1 400 and 700  ( thick line ) .",
    "recall that the contribution of high velocity clouds to the [ o ii]/  line ratio is due to the diffuse radiation generated at the high temperature post - shock zone reaching the low ionization zone . in order to illustrate this ,",
    "the distribution of the temperature as well as the fractional abundance of oxygen ions downstream are plotted in fig . 5 for an sd model with = 700 .",
    "notice , however , that explaining the [ oii]/  line ratio only with sd clouds may not be acceptable in a global picture for the nlr , since rd clouds must be present and contributing to other emission lines .",
    "indeed , the reduction by a factor of 3 is not only dictated by the fit of the [ oi]/  data ( fig . 3 b ) , but is consistent with a general scenario .",
    "regarding the [ oi]/  line ratio , notice that sd models overpredict the observed [ o i]/  data by a factor of @xmath1 3 .",

    "accordingly , the emitted radiation gets absorbed in the cloud itself between @xmath1 13.6 ev and 500 ev , hence the emission gap in this region shows up in figs . 7 and 8 .",
    "the high velocity model 6 has however a lower column density ( @xmath15 10@xmath41 @xmath4 ) because is radiation - bounded .",
    "in fact , due to strong compression , the temperature rapidly decreases downstream at a distance @xmath44 cm from the shock front .",

    "however , the x - ray data in the frequency range @xmath45 and @xmath18 hz impose a limit on the relative constribution of this model 6 ( see below ) .",
    "all together , the fit of the continuum at the uv range is obtained with model 2 . the dust - to - gas ratio that characterizes this model is d / g = @xmath46 . the other models ( models 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) underpredict the data .",
    "the summed sed which better explains the observations is shown in fig .",
    "the main components are summed separately : radio emission , reradiation by dust in the ir , gas bremsstrahlung , and the flux from the active source . moreover , as was found for many seyfert galaxies ( see contini & viegas 2000 ) a black - body with temperature of @xmath1 3000 k is used to roughly represent the optical continuum due to the stellar population ( thick solid line ) .",
    "notice that we are interested in the bulk contribution of the stars rather than the detailed shape of their continuum emission .",
    "thus , although we could use the spectrum of an early - type galaxy or the spectrum of the central region of a sa galaxy to get a more realistic fit of the stellar contribution , it would not change our conclusions .",
    "for instance , malkan & filippenko ( 1983 ) find that about 1/10 of the emission at 5500 and @xmath1 1/3 at 9000 are due to stars ( in aperture of 10 \" , just the same aperture of the optical and ir data used in this paper ) , namely they estimated the stellar emission to be 14 mjy at 5500  .",
    "we have added the corresponding value to fig . 7 ( star )",
    ". accounting for the errors in the observations and models , notice the good agreement ( within 30% ) with the black body emission curve .",
    "the bump in the ir is rather wide , representing the sum of contributions from different models . in previous papers ( e.g. contini et al .",

    "is assumed in model 6 , indicating that high velocity material is rather dusty .",
    "a shock velocity of 1500  produces a post shock region at a temperature of 3.4 @xmath48 k , in agreement with the hot plasma temperatures derived from the x - ray data . indicating that high velocity material is rather dusty .",
    "shocked clouds with @xmath1 700  produce lower temperatures , @xmath1 10@xmath49 k , which are still within the range of values estimated from x - ray data ( e.g. george et al .",
    "these velocities are also revealed by optical lines (  4 ) .    yet",
    ", the contribution of a model with = 1500  in the sed should be taken with a relative small weight ( @xmath17 2.9 @xmath50 ) , because the data in the soft x - ray range constrain the model . as a consequence ,",
    "the contribution of this model to the ir lines is very low .",
    "thus , a signature of these high velocity clouds is not expected to be seen in the infrared emission - line spectrum .    in the radio range , pedlar et al .",

    "they interpreted the emission as due to thermal free - free emission from the nlr . in the present modeling ,",
    "the radio data are instead well explained by synchrotron radiation with spectral index -0.75 , generated by fermi mechanism at the shock front ( bell 1978 ) .",
    "notice that self - absorption of the bremsstrahlung emission at these radio wavelengths may be important , hence its contribution is negligeble ( see , for instance contini et al 1998b ) .",
    "in this paper we have modeled the narrow emission - line and continuum spectra of ngc 4151 with particular attention to the large range of velocities indicated by the line profiles .",

    "2000 , kraemer et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is found that the contribution of each cloud to a given line may show a large variation from line to line .    in the central region high velocity clouds revealed by the observations ( hutchings et al .",

    "quantitative modeling of the ne and si infrared lines from different ionization levels leads to more results .",
    "notice , however , that the observations give the integrated flux from all the galaxy , so that it is not possible to understand which type of clouds prevail in different regions .",
    "sd clouds with = 300 strongly contribute to all ne lines corresponding to different ionization levels ( table 2 ) , while rd clouds with velocities of 500  and reached by a strong radiation flux ( log = 12.7 ) contribute particularly to the [ neiii ] and [ sivii ] ir lines . due to the high postshock temperature , high velocity clouds (= 1500 ) would overpredict the [ siix ] 3.94 line .",
    "therefore , the contribution of these clouds is low .",
    "a large contribution to [ nev ] and [ siii ] lines come from low velocity ( 100 ) clouds reached by an ionizing radiation characterized by log = 11 .",

    "this would imply that the time scale for the agn phase in ngc 4151 should be larger than 5 @xmath58 years .",
    "the modeling is based on the coupled effect of shocks and photoionization operating in the narrow emission line gas . as such",
    ", it implies the existence of emitting clouds with velocities and densities in a large range .",
    "an emitting - cloud distribution in the velocity / density space is precisely what is revealed by the hst observations of this galaxy .",
    "this together with the fair fitting of the line and continuum spectra obtained in this work reinforces our hypothesis that shocks and photoionization are effectively coupled in the nlr of agn .",

    "<S> the multiwavelength emission spectrum and associated velocity field of the seyfert prototype ngc 4151 is modeled . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 4151 has been since the thirties subject of extensive modeling , nuclear photoionization being the basic approach considered by all authors . </S>",
    "<S> hst data has impressively revealed the existence of a large range of velocities ( 100 - 1500 ) dominating the emitting clouds in the extended emission line region of the galaxy . following this observational result , a revision of the photoionization modeling approach applied to ngc 4151 </S>",
    "<S> is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that a mixture of radiation dominated clouds and shock dominated clouds are required to explain the multiwavelength line and continuum spectra of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the relative contribution of shock excitation versus photoionization is consistently modeled along the nebulae taking into account the spatial variation of both flux and velocity of main optical and uv lines . </S>",
    "<S> the multiwavelength continuum spectrum of ngc 4151 is then nicely accounted for by a combination of nuclear emission at high energy , gas bremsstrahlung , and dust emission . </S>",
    "<S> the last two phenomena are directly linked to the composite shock and photoionization excitation of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> the radio sed is found however dominated by synchrotron emission created by fermi mechanism at the shock front . in addition , a 3x10@xmath0 k black body component accounts for the host galaxy contribution . as a result of the modeling , silicon is found depleted by a high factor and included in dust grains , while n / c abundance ratio is found compatible with cosmic values . </S>"
