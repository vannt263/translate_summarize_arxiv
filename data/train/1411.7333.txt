    "]    because the tight - binding fitting method has been successfully applied to period four transition metal oxides , such as lanio@xmath18@xcite , we first tried to fit the dft results for bulk y@xmath1ir@xmath1o@xmath2 to a tight binding model that included both direct and indirect hopping between the local @xmath6 orbitals of the ir@xmath7 ions .",
    "the hopping matrix elements were generated using slater - koster ( sk)@xcite integrals .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : tb_fit ] above , in order to obtain even a semi - quantitative fit for the @xmath14 bands ( upper 4 ) one must include at least out to third - neighbor hoppings . even in this case , however , the lower @xmath15 bands are fit rather poorly .",
    "the failure of the tight - binding fitting reveals the complexity of @xmath4 orbits , and their much larger spatial extent compared to the @xmath19 orbitals . in order to obtain an satisfactory model",

    "the spin - orbit coupling can be treated in two different ways based on wannier projection .",
    "one route is to first perform a dft calculation and wannier projection without soc , and then add an onsite soc ( @xmath48 ) term  by hand \" whose strength is determined through least - square fitting of the wannier+soc bands to the dft bands with the soc _ turned on_@xcite . alternatively , one can perform a dft calculation with soc turned on and then obtain a direct wannier projection of the soc coupled states @xcite .    in those wannier projections ,",

    "this approach should be able to capture the main character of the phases when interactions are further treated at the hartree - fock level . by comparison ,",

    "<S> the non - magnetic electronic band structure along with wannier fits are shown in fig.[fig : films ] ( d ) for the bilayer and in fig.[fig : films ] ( e ) for the tkt trilayer , which indicates both systems are metallic . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the bulk electronic band structure shown in fig.[fig : bulk_bands ] ( b ) , the quality of the wannier fit is less good for the films . </S>",
    "<S> ( see supplemental for details . ) </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the lower symmetry of the films compared to the bulk and the fact that the iridium @xmath4-orbitals are rather extended . </S>",
    "<S> as we show in the supplemental information , a _ tight - binding fit _ to the bulk band structure that includes out to third neighbor hopping yields a rather poor fit to the dft results . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the iridium @xmath4-orbitals in the bilayer and trilayer films have a spatial extent that is at least comparable to the film thickness and therefore the @xmath4-orbitals are influenced by the  capping \" y@xmath1hf@xmath1o@xmath2 layers and experience a local environment of reduced symmetry . while this leads to a slightly less good wannier fit than we obtained for the bulk , the bands and the density of states around the fermi energy are reasonably close . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect there to be little numerical difference in a hartree - fock calculation that makes use of the wannier fit shown , and one that makes use of a fit that better approximates the dft result . </S>",
    "<S> we note that since the bilayer breaks inversion symmetry , the bands in fig.[fig : films ] ( d ) are non - degenerate , while the bands of the inversion symmetry - preserving tkt layer in fig.[fig : films ] ( e ) are two - fold degenerate . as we mentioned earlier </S>",
    "<S> , the larger spatial extent of the @xmath4-orbitals compared to the @xmath19-orbitals is expected to make tmo films with heavy transition metals less susceptible to interfacial strain  a quality that might enhance the robustness of theoretical predictions for topological phases in thin - film systems with heavier elements .    after obtaining a _ non - interacting _ hamiltonian in a local ( @xmath6-like wannier ) basis for the bilayer and tkt trilayer , @xmath20 we studied the full hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 within hartree - fock theory . in eq . and </S>",

    "<S> the rotationally invariant form allows the hartree - fock calculation to be performed in any basis , and allows us to extend most previous studies on the iridates by explicitly including the full @xmath6 subspace and keeping the spin - orbit coupling finite , as opposed to working in a strong ( infinite ) spin - orbit coupling limit with only @xmath14 states in the hilbert space . the main approximation made in the form of the interaction given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> is the neglect of the hund s coupling . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this restricts our results to low - spin configurations on the iridium ions , which is consistent with prior work@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the self - consistent calculation generates a local minimum of the total energy through the variation of the coupling constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which are determined by the eigenstates below the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 and chern invariants are calculated as described in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> the hartree - fock results for the [ 111]-grown bilayer and tkt trilayer are shown in fig.[fig : phase_diagram ] , where the strength of @xmath17 is varied . because @xmath17 is an effective interaction parameter within the @xmath6 manifold , it is difficult to determine its precise value from experiment or theory . </S>",
    "<S> estimates in the literature range from 0.4 - 2.0 ev@xcite , so we include this range in our calculations .    based on the band structures shown in fig.[fig : films ] , </S>",
    "<S> the small-@xmath17 behavior is expected to be metallic , and we indeed find this is the case . from figs.[fig : films ] ( d ) , ( e ) one can see that the band width of the states closest to the fermi energy are on the order of 0.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one expects possible transitions when @xmath17 is of the order of 0.5 ev , and one again finds that in both systems time - reversal symmetry in spontaneously broken ( _ i.e. _ , magnetism sets in ) for interactions of this rough magnitude . by investigating the small @xmath17 metallic phases in both cases , we find that the metallic state in the bilayer is actually a topological metal@xcite : while the direct gap is finite throughout the brillouin zone , the indirect gap is negative . </S>",
    "<S> the finite direct gap allows one to compute the @xmath5 invariant for the lowest 20 bands , and we find that it is topologically non - trivial . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> if one were able to deform the bands so that the direct gap remains open while the indirect gap is made positive , one would obtain a @xmath5 topological insulator . because the change in energy of states near the fermi energy required to do this is of the order of a few tens of mev , a judicious choice of substrate in experiment </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : phase_diagram ] ]    a closer examination of the tkt trilayer also reveals a topological metallic phase , the chern metal around @xmath37 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the situation in this case is qualitatively similar to the topological metal in the bilayer , except that the chern metal has broken time - reversal symmetry : the chern metal has a finite direct gap throughout the brillouin zone , but a negative indirect gap such that the lowest bands have a total chern number of 1 so that a deformation of the hamiltonian that keeps the direct gap open but makes the indirect gap positive would result in a chern insulator . </S>",
