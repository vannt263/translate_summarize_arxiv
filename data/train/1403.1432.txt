    "x - ray reflection is a common phenomenon in accreting x - ray sources .",
    "x - rays originating from the neutron star ( ns ) , in flares above an accretion disc or at the bottom of a jet irradiate the disc .",
    "some of this x - ray radiation is then reflected off the disc leading to an x - ray continuum spectrum and emission lines formed in the fluorescent and recombination process .",
    "the shape of the reflected continuum spectrum is determined by photoelectric absorption which is dominant at lower energies , electron scattering which is dominant at higher energies , and the continuum emission from the reflecting material itself .",
    "if the reflection spectrum originates close to the compact object relativistic effects such as gravitational redshift and the relativistic doppler effect broaden the reflection signatures in a characteristic way @xcite . by modeling the relativistically broadened reflection spectra",
    "one can in principle infer the inner radius of the accretion disc .",
    "the signatures of x - ray reflection such as the relativistically broadened fe k - shell emission line have been observed in the x - ray spectra of a number of accreting compact objects e.g. active galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and x - ray binaries @xcite . + the most frequently used reflection models : reflionx @xcite and xillver @xcite are best suited for spectra of agn or x - ray binaries in the low ( luminosity ) , hard ( spectrum ) state .",
    "these models assume a power - law incident spectrum and solar abundances in the accretion disc ( with the sole exception of the fe abundance which can vary ) .",
    "x - ray reflection in x - ray binaries in the high ( luminosity ) , soft ( spectrum ) state was considered by @xcite . in this model",
    "the disc is no longer assumed to be cold like it is assumed in e.g. reflionx but its emission is described by a black body with a variable temperature .",
    "a chemical composition of the accretion disc that differs from solar has not yet been considered when calculating the reflection spectra ( with the said exception of fe ) .",
    "given that there is a growing number of sources showing x - ray reflection signatures from a disc with non - solar composition , there is need for reflection models which would be able to describe these reflection features self - consistently .",
    "+ in this study we consider two sources : 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 that likely belong to the subclass of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) called ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) .",
    "ucxbs consist of a white dwarf donor star that transfers mass to a ns or a black hole ( bh ) accretor .",
    "they have an orbital period of @xmath7 min .",
    "the accretor in the case of 4u  0614 + 091 is a ns given the presence of type i x - ray bursts @xcite . in the case of 4u  1543@xmath0624 the nature of the accretor is uncertain ( it could either be a ns or a bh ) .",
    "for the two sources studied in this paper tentative periods have been suggested : @xmath8 min for 4u  0614 + 091 ( shahbaz et al .",
    "2008 ) and @xmath9 min for 4u  1543@xmath0624 @xcite .",
    "the optical spectra of both of these sources show emission lines of carbon and oxygen indicating that the donor star is either a carbon - oxygen ( co ) or an oxygen - neon - magnesium ( onemg ) white dwarf @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite have discovered a relativistically broadened o viii ly@xmath1 reflection line in the x - ray spectra of these two sources .",
    "+ the aim of this study is to investigate the potential changes in the properties of the reflected emission when considering co - rich discs instead of disc material consisting of elements with solar abundances . the first sample of reflection models assuming co - rich reflecting material are compared to archival as well as new observations of 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 obtained using the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ satellites .",
    ".the range of xillver@xmath10 parameters calculated in the grid 1 and grid 2 tailored to model the spectra of 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 , respectively .",
    "the parameters of this model include the power - law index @xmath11 , the power - law cutoff energy @xmath12 , the temperature of the black body representing the disc emission @xmath13 , the fraction of the flux of the power - law divided by the flux of the black body @xmath14 , the abundance of c and o : @xmath15 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath16 parameter fixed during fitting      [ fig : edge ]    we find that the fit using the relativistically broadened xillver to the data of 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 requires an overabundance of neutral ne in order to describe a strong absorption edge around 14   present in the data .",
    "the ne i k - edge originating partly in the ism and partly in csm has already been suggested by @xcite in the data of both sources and confirmed by e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . however , we have found ( see sec 4.1 and 4.2 ) that the fit to the data of 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 using the fit model which includes the new xillver@xmath10 model is causing the abundance of ne in the tbnew model to decrease compared to the fit using only the continuum model .",
    "the position of the ne i k - edge ( @xmath17  ) is close to the position of the o viii k - edge ( @xmath18  @xmath19 kev ) and looking at the best - fit xillver@xmath10 models obtained when fitting the data of 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 the o viii k - edge is evidently present together with the o viii ly@xmath1 emission line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model_0614 ] ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the relativistic broadening included in the fit model can smear the o viii k - edge significantly as is the case in the fit to the rgs and epic - pn data and hence fails to fully describe the sharp edge around 14   present in the data . +",
    "we investigate whether the xillver@xmath10 reflection model would be able to provide a self - consistent description of the o viii ly@xmath1 line and the o viii k - edge without the need of an overabundance of neutral ne in 4u  0614 + 091 .",
    "we fit the tbnew*(powerlaw+rdblur*xillver@xmath10 ) model to the rgs data of observation 1 only in the wavelength range @xmath20   ( @xmath21 kev ) .",
    "we find the best - fit with @xmath22 for 1289 d.o.f . and the parameters of the fit : @xmath23 ( for @xmath24 @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 kev , @xmath31 .",
    "the best - fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edge ] .",
    "the abundance of ne decreases further with respect to the fit obtained using rgs and epic - pn data , however , it is still not consistent with the solar value . furthermore , we note , that the abundance of fe in this fit is @xmath32 . the tbnew model uses solid - state cross - section measurements for fe @xcite .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the fe l - shell absorption ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is difficult to constrain the abundance of fe using the tbnew model only .",
    "we have taken the first steps to adapt the xillver model @xcite to the case of reflection in ucxbs with co - rich accretion discs .",
    "we have increased the abundances of all the elements except he and allow the abundance of c and o to vary during the fit . additionally , we have considered a cutoff power - law incident spectrum with a cutoff energy in the range @xmath33 kev .",
    "as expected , the new reflection model ( xillver@xmath10 ) shows stronger c and o emission lines . on the other hand the strength of the other emission lines e.g. ne ,",
    "si , s , fe is decreased .",
    "in contrast to the xillver model which assumes the reflecting material to be cold , the reflecting material in the new xillver@xmath10 model has a higher temperature which provides a better physical description of the gas in the accretion disc in x - ray binaries . + we have tested the modified reflection model xillver@xmath10 using archival and new _ xmm - newton _ spectra of 4u  0614 + 091 and _ chandra _ spectra of 4u  1543@xmath0624 . in the case of 4u  0614 + 091",
    "we find that the new reflection model can describe the reflection signatures in the spectra and it indicates an overabundance of c and o of @xmath34 with respect to the solar photospheric value of @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the current xillver@xmath10 model is preliminary as it has a limited number of grid points .",
    "we have found that some of the parameters of this model e.g. @xmath13 , @xmath35 , @xmath15 settle on the upper or lower limit values in the current grid which suggests that more grid points will need to be calculated before robust conclusions about the various parameter values can be drawn . additionally , given that there are no significant c emission lines visible in the rgs and letgs spectra of the studied sources , it is difficult to establish whether the overabundance of c is also required in order to describe the reflection spectra .",
    "we note that the xillver@xmath10 model absorbed by the ism also does not show significant c emission lines for the best - fit @xmath15 abundance .",
    "hence , it is possible that the c emission is not strong enough if the c is overabundant .",
    "+ considering the parameters of the relativistic broadening obtained when fitting the xillver@xmath10 model to observations 1 , 2 and 3 of 4u  0614 + 091 , we find that the value of the inner radius of the accretion disc is close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) @xmath36 in both low / hard and high / soft states .",
    "this result contradicts the standard accretion disc model @xcite in which the accretion disc is truncated further from the isco in the low / hard state .",
    "it needs to be mentioned , however , that it is possible that the properties of the reflecting material assumed in the xillver@xmath10 ( e.g. the abundances of elements or ionization structure of the disc ) still deviate from the properties of the accretion disc in the ucxb 4u  0614 + 091 which prevent us from obtaining a self - consistent description of the data .",
    "additionally , as mentioned above the caveat about the incomplete grid applies here as well .",
    "+      we confirm the presence of a strong absorption edge at @xmath6   in the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of 4u  0614 + 091 obtained in 2013 and letgs spectra of 4u  1543@xmath0624 obtained in 2012 found before by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the absorption edge at @xmath6   can be partly described by the ne i k - edge present in the neutral absorption model and partly by the o viii k - edge present in the xillver@xmath10 model .",
    "the possible presence of an o viii k - edge or radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) in the x - ray spectra of 4u  0614 + 091 has been suggested before by @xcite .",
    "we find that the abundance of ne decreases when the xillver@xmath10 model is used .",
    "the best - fit parameters suggest , however , that the overabundance of ne with respect to the solar photospheric value of @xcite is still required .",
    "it is important to stress that the value of the ne abundance can be uncertain , given the difficulty in measuring the abundance of this element in the sun .",
    "we measure @xmath37 with respect to the solar photospheric value of @xcite when fitting the rgs data ( see sec .",
    "however , the solar photospheric abundance of ne in @xcite is for example lower by a factor of @xmath38 and @xmath39 with respect to the solar abundance of ne in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "hence , it is possible that the measured @xmath40 is much closer to ( or even consistent with ) the abundance of ne in the ism",
    ". additionally , we note that part of the ne in ism is thought to be in the ionized form ( e.g. ne ii , ne iii , see * ? ? ? * ) which is currently not taken into account in the tbnew model . as a result the measurement of the neutral ne abundance could be affected to some degree .",
    "we have found that the combination of a cutoff power - law with a cutoff energy of @xmath41 kev and a black body with a temperature of @xmath42 kev can describe the letgs data of 4u  1543@xmath0624 .",
    "these characteristics of the spectrum of 4u  1543@xmath0624 appear similar to the characteristics of spectra of ultra - luminous x - ray sources when observed in the ultraluminous state @xcite .",
    "accretion near the eddington limit can happen in ucxbs when the system comes into contact @xcite .",
    "theory predicts that this stage happens in bh or ns ucxb for orbital periods of around @xmath43 min depending on the type of the accretor and the influence of the thermal pressure on the donor star radius ( lennart van haaften , private communication ) .",
    "this limit on the orbital period is around half of the period observed so far in the lightcurve of 4u  1543@xmath0624 ( @xmath44 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the unabsorbed flux of the ucxb 4u  1543@xmath0624 measured using the letgs spectra is @xmath45 ( @xmath46 kev energy range ) .",
    "assuming that this source is accreting near the eddington limit @xmath47 , we estimate the distance to the source to be @xmath48 .",
    "given the source galactic coordinates ( @xmath49 ) and the estimated distance , 4u  1543@xmath0624 could be in the outskirts of the galaxy and possibly belong to a halo population of lmxbs , implying that this source was kicked out of our galaxy at formation .",
    "+ we note that if 4u  1543@xmath0624 is indeed accreting near the eddington limit , the @xmath50 parameter measured using the relativistically broadened reflection model might not represent the true inner radius of the accretion disc .",
    "an optically thick corona present above the inner part of the accretion disc can modify the reflection spectrum ( through absorption and multiple scattering events ) in a way that will destroy the characteristic , inner - disc signatures .",
    "we have taken the first steps into describing the x - ray reflection spectra of ucxbs with co - rich disc . however , apart from the issues already mentioned before in this section such as the limited number of grid points in the new model there are still questions remaining on the details of the x - ray reflection process and accretion disc physics in ucxbs",
    ". those questions will need to be addressed before we are able to provide robust constraints on e.g. the geometry of the accretion disc or the abundances of elements in the accretion disc using x - ray reflection signatures .",
    "+ for example , we have no robust observational constraints on the hydrogen number density in the inner regions of the accretion discs in ucxbs . therefore , we have assumed in this analysis a hydrogen number density of @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "however , the ionization state of the reflecting material and hence the shape of the reflection spectrum depends on this parameter .",
    "given the quality of the current data , introducing the density as a free parameters would probably reveal many degenerate solutions for the same dataset . however , future missions e.g. _ astro - h _ , _ athena+ _ with higher spectral resolution and effective area than _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ will reveal more details of the x - ray reflection signatures observed in the spectra and potentially be able to constrain the density of the reflecting material along with the currently considered parameters .",
    "+ another concern is the underabundance of h in the accretion disc of ucxbs . in our analysis",
    "we mimic the underabundance of h by increasing the abundance of all the other elements . given the uncertainly on the exact abundance of h in ucxbs and the capabilities of the currently available reflection models we fixed the abundance of all the elements except he , c and o at ten times the solar value .",
    "however , future reflection models should be able to provide reflection spectra for the abundances of h even lower with respect to the other elements than currently assumed .",
