    "the formulation of a mathematically consistent quantum theory of gravity whose predictive power extends down to arbitrarily small distances continues to be one of the major challenges of modern theoretical physics @xcite . even though the first attempts at quantizing the gravitational field date back to the 1930s @xcite the various approaches available today are still plagued by considerable technical and conceptual problems . on the conceptual side ,",
    "the `` background independence '' @xcite of classical general relativity and of the yet to be constructed theory of quantum gravity is at the heart of many difficulties . in the asymptotic safety approach to quantum gravity",
    "@xcite the gravitational degrees of freedom are described by a metric @xmath2 , as in general relativity , and the standard rules of quantum mechanics are applied to it .",
    "nevertheless , because of the requirement of `` background independence '' , the resulting quantum field theory of gravity has many features which are rather different from the familiar matter field theories on a fixed , non - dynamical spacetime .",
    "these unusual features emerge because the theory is supposed to dynamically explain the origin of the spacetime it `` lives '' on as a kind of ground state property , and as a result , in its construction no metric should be distinguished from any other a priori .",
    "most investigations of the asymptotic safety scenario are based upon the effective average action for gravity @xcite . in this approach",
    "the requirement of `` background independence '' in the above sense of the word is met , somewhat paradoxically , by means of the background field technique @xcite . even though , formally , the gravitational average action obtains by a similar wilsonian mode cutoff and coarse graining operation as its counterpart for ordinary matter field theories @xcite there is a conceptually crucial difference : the metric determines all physical ( proper ) length and mass scales",
    "; in particular it fixes the physical coarse graining scale which is to be attributed to the cutoff parameter @xmath3 built into the average action @xmath4 .",
    "hence in quantum gravity the problem is that the field that is `` averaged '' or `` coarse grained '' by itself has to define the physical meaning of this coarse graining operation .",
    "if one was to use a rigid metric for this purpose the parameter @xmath3 would have no physical interpretation ; hence @xmath4 hardly could be used for `` renormalization group improving '' classical solutions or field equations @xcite , for instance .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , henceforth referred to as [ i ] , we explained in detail how the use of the background field technique , besides making @xmath4 a diffeomorphism invariant functional , can make the average action and its renormalization group ( rg ) flow `` background independent '' in the sense that nowhere in the construction any preferred ( rigid ) metric occurs . in order to disentangle this problem from the gauge fixing issues which are the usual motivation for the background method we considered the `` conformal reduction '' of quantum einstein gravity ( qeg ) in which only the conformal factor of the metric is quantized and all other degrees of freedom",
    "are discarded . performing the conformal reduction on top of the usual einstein ",
    "hilbert truncation one is led to quantize an action of the familiar @xmath5-type . as we saw in [ i ]",
    "the rg flow in this conformally reduced einstein ",
    "hilbert ( or `` creh '' ) truncation is different from that in a standard scalar matter field theory , the reason being that in the gravitational case the mode suppression term @xmath6 in the functional integral defining @xmath4 must have a specific background field dependence in order to comply with the requirement of `` background independence '' .",
    "this extra field dependence of @xmath7 is absent in the matter field theory . as a consequence ,",
    "gravity in the creh approximation has an rg flow which is very different from that of a standard @xmath5-theory . including the extra field dependence turns the merely logarithmic running of the cosmological constant ( earlier discussed by polyakov @xcite and by jackiw et al .",
    "@xcite ) into the expected @xmath8-running , for instance .",
    "( similar observations had been made by floreanini and percacci @xcite in a different theory . )",
    "remarkably , the rg flow of the creh approximation turned out to be qualitatively identical to the full einstein ",
    "hilbert flow where all degrees of freedom are quantized .",
    "in particular it has a non - gaussian fixed point ( ngfp ) suitable for the asymptotic safety construction .",
    "the counterpart of the creh approximation on the side of the standard matter theories is symanzik s asymptotically free @xmath5-theory with a negative quartic coupling @xcite .",
    "this theory has a potential which is unbounded below , and it is notorious for the resulting infrared instability . in the context of qeg",
    "this instability is not an issue , however . in the full theory",
    "it is presumably cured by higher derivative terms .",
    "in fact , it is known @xcite that a @xmath9-term , added to the einstein ",
    "hilbert action , stabilizes the kinetic term of the conformal factor at high scales ; cf .",
    "also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the upshot of the analysis in [ i ] was that the quantum fluctuations of the conformal factor alone seem to be typical of the full set of degrees of freedom in @xmath2 as far as their impact on the rg flow is concerned .",
    "this suggests that also in more general truncations the conformal factor should play a representative role . since the scalar  like reduced theory is technically much simpler than full - fledged qeg it suggests itself as a tool which should allow us to probe regions of theory space which are too difficult computationally in the full theory .    in the present paper",
    "we start this program with the local potential approximation , or `` lpa '' , which includes arbitrary non - derivative terms in the truncation ansatz . in fact",
    ", the creh truncation ( in @xmath10 euclidean dimensions ) obtains by inserting metrics of the form @xmath11 into the einstein ",
    "hilbert action .",
    "here @xmath12 is a fixed reference metric .",
    "the result is a kinetic term for @xmath13 which , apart from its sign , is of the standard form @xmath14 , as well as a potential with two terms , proportional to @xmath15 and @xmath5 , respectively : @xmath16 ( here @xmath17 is the curvature scalar of @xmath12 . ) the idea of the lpa @xcite is to retain the standard kinetic term from the creh approximation but to allow for arbitrary non - derivative terms : @xmath18 & = + \\int \\!\\!{\\mathrm{d}}^4 x \\ , \\sqrt{{\\widehat}g\\,}~u_k ( \\phi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the running potential @xmath19 may develop any @xmath13-dependence ; it is no longer restricted to be a quartic polynomial .",
    "the lpa has played an important role in the rg analysis of standard scalar theories , in particular in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the approach to convexity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore the obvious next step in the analysis of conformally reduced qeg .",
    "the relevant theory space is infinite dimensional now ; the corresponding flow equations will include a partial differential equation for @xmath20 .",
    "clearly the lpa can not be a numerically precise approximation to the full theory , even if the fluctuations of @xmath13 have always a `` typical '' impact on the rg flow .",
    "nevertheless it should provide us with some qualitative understanding and conceptual insights into the general properties of qeg .",
    "the ( relative ! ) technical simplicity of the reduced theory comes at a certain price , however . in general",
    "it will not be possible to relate terms in @xmath19 to invariants @xmath21 $ ] depending on the full metric in a unique way .",
    "typically there will be many invariants contributing to a given term in the potential when we insert @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , the lpa is sensitive to a certain projection ( or `` shadow '' ) of the invariants @xmath21 $ ] which make up the general @xmath23 $ ] . if @xmath12 is the metric on a curved space , @xmath19 encodes information about higher derivative terms , for instance .",
    "if we consider a series expansion in the curvature scalar , for instance , @xmath24 & = \\sum_n c_n ( k ) \\",
    ", \\int \\!\\ ! { \\mathrm{d}}^4 x \\ , \\sqrt{g\\,}~r(g)^n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and choose @xmath12 to be the metric on a unit @xmath10-sphere , then the corresponding potential @xmath25 \\ ,",
    "/ \\!\\int { \\mathrm{d}}^4 x \\ , \\sqrt{{\\widehat}g\\,}$ ] reads @xmath26 the constant term in , @xmath27 , descends from the invariant @xmath28 , but also @xmath29 or @xmath30 would contribute to the constant piece in @xmath19 , as would many non - local terms .",
    "similarly , the monomial @xmath31 receives contributions from @xmath32 and the goroff ",
    "sagnotti term @xmath33 @xcite , among others .",
    "despite these limitations the experience with conventional field theories suggests that the lpa is a powerful tool for a first exploration of regions in theory space which are computationally inaccessible otherwise . in the present paper",
    "we shall employ it in order to analyze and illustrate several conceptual issues related to the renormalization group flow of @xmath4 which are as to yet too computationally demanding to be studied in the full theory .",
    "in particular we focus on the following three topics .",
    "[ [ a ] ] ( a ) + + +    in the lpa we have the possibility to obtain information about the non - gaussian fixed point of the gravitational average action on an _ infinite dimensional theory space_. we shall find that the rg flow on the space of ( dimensionless ) potential functions and newton s constant admits both a gaussian and non - gaussian fixed point .",
    "we compute the fixed point potentials and perform a linear stability analysis in each case .",
    "the scaling dimensions of the gaussian fixed point ( gfp ) will be seen to characterize the difference between a standard scalar and the conformal factor in a particularly clearcut way .",
    "the scaling fields and dimensions ( critical exponents @xmath34 ) of the ngfp are of interest for the asymptotic safety construction .    the relevant scaling fields , those with @xmath35 , decay for @xmath36 , while the irrelevant ones , with @xmath37 , blow up in this limit .",
    "an asymptotically safe quantum theory is specified by any rg trajectory that hits the ngfp for @xmath36 .",
    "we define the _ ultraviolet ( uv ) critical manifold _",
    "@xmath38 to be the set of all points in theory space which are pulled into the ngfp under the inverse rg flow ( i.e. , for increasing @xmath3 ) . in the simplest case @xmath38 is a smooth submanifold of theory space .",
    "every complete rg trajectory which lies inside @xmath38 defines a possible quantum theory .",
    "hence , with @xmath39 the dimensionality of the critical manifold , there exists a @xmath40-parameter family of asymptotically safe quantum field theories ; which one is actually realized in nature must be decided by an experimental determination of exactly those @xmath40-parameters whose values are not predicted by theory .",
    "if @xmath38 is indeed a smooth manifold , and the ngfp has no marginal scaling fields ( @xmath41 ) , then @xmath40 equals the dimensionality of a subspace of the tangent space to @xmath38 at the ngfp , namely the one spanned by the relevant scaling fields , i.e.  those whose critical exponents @xmath34 have a positive real part . therefore the number of relevant scaling fields is related to the degree of predictivity that can be achieved .",
    "( see @xcite for a more general discussion . )    within the lpa we will be able to study @xmath38 near the ngfp in great detail .",
    "we shall find that the value of @xmath40 depends sensitively on the space of functions in which allowed scaling fields are supposed to `` live '' .",
    "it turns out that in principle there could be infinitely many relevant ones , but as we shall see this question can not be decided on the basis of the lpa alone .",
    "[ [ b ] ] ( b ) + + +    using numerical methods we shall analyze the rg evolution of @xmath19 also in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we are particularly interested in phase transitions , triggered by a variation of @xmath3 , in which the global minimum of @xmath19 either jumps , or continuously evolves from a value @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "we interpret this as a transition from the familiar phase of gravity with broken diffeomorphism invariance to a _ phase with unbroken diffeomorphism invariance_.    we are considering metrics of the form @xmath22 where @xmath13 is the expectation value of the quantum conformal factor and @xmath12 is a non - degenerate classical reference metric .",
    "if the expectation value @xmath13 , interpreted here as the minimum of @xmath44 , is nonzero the expectation value of the metric , @xmath45 , is non - degenerate as well .",
    "but if @xmath43 then the metric has a vanishing expectation value .",
    "( more precisely , in view of @xmath46 and since @xmath22 depends on @xmath13 quadratically , it is the vielbein @xmath47 that has a vanishing expectation value . )",
    "the situation where @xmath43 can be thought of as the restoration of a spontaneously broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "the relevant local symmetries are the spacetime diffeomorphisms .",
    "if the quantum state is such that @xmath48 the group of diffeomorphisms is spontaneously broken down to the stability group of @xmath49 . if @xmath50 , say , this stability group is the poincar group .",
    "the broken phase of gravity is the one we are familiar with .",
    "it is conceivable though that the symmetry breaking effectively disappears at very small distances .",
    "this is exactly what happens in spontaneously broken yang ",
    "mills theories , in the standard model , say . if we study phenomena involving momentum scales far above the w - mass , the full @xmath51 symmetry appears unbroken .",
    "technically this symmetry restoration can be inferred from the running higgs potential @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "we are going to analyze the running potential of the conformal factor in the same spirit .",
    "we shall find that typical trajectories in @xmath38 , for @xmath3 sufficiently large , describe a phase of unbroken diffeomorphism invariance in the sense that the metric has a vanishing expectation value there .",
    "[ [ c ] ] ( c ) + + +    while the beta functions implied by the functional rg equations do not refer to any special metric they do depend on the _ topology _ of the manifold which carries the metrics @xmath54 , @xmath2 , @xmath55 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon by discussing in parallel the two cases where the topology of the ( euclidean ) spacetime manifold is that of a sphere @xmath56 and of flat space @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the beta functions ( or rather , functionals ) of @xmath20 are different in the two cases since they depend on the spectrum of the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator built from the corresponding @xmath12 .",
    "the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we review and expand on conformally reduced qeg ; in particular we show how the background field method achieves `` background independence '' , and we introduce two types of background ",
    "quantum field split symmetries .",
    "the lpa is introduced in section [ s3 ] then and the corresponding flow equations are derived for the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 topologies . in section [ s3s ]",
    "we analyze various general properties of the lpa flow , and section [ s4 ] is devoted to its fixed points ; for both the gaussian and the non - gaussian fixed point we determine the fixed point potential and perform a linear stability analysis in order to determine the local tangent space to the uv critical manifold . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we solve the partial differential equation for the running potential numerically and describe various scenarios for the phase transition to a phase of ( conformally reduced ) qeg with unbroken diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ s6 ] .",
    "in the construction of the full - fledged gravitational average action @xcite there are three different metrics that play a role : the microscopic metric , i.e.  the integration variable in the path integral , @xmath54 , its expectation value @xmath58 , and the background metric @xmath59 . in conformally reduced gravity [ i ] all three of them",
    "are assumed conformal to the same , fixed reference metric @xmath12 .",
    "we write the conformal factor of @xmath54 and @xmath59 as @xmath60 and @xmath61 where , in @xmath62 dimensions , @xmath63 .",
    "the motivation for the exponent @xmath64 is that in this way the einstein ",
    "hilbert action provides a standard kinetic term for @xmath65 .    in the approach of [ i ] the original path",
    "integral over @xmath54 is reduced to an integral over @xmath66 only , and the resulting scalar  like theory is then reformulated using the background field method .",
    "the `` microscopic '' conformal factor @xmath65 is decomposed as @xmath67 and the @xmath65-integral is replaced by an integral over @xmath68 .",
    "we denote the expectation values of @xmath68 and @xmath65 by @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "thus the following metrics are to be distinguished : @xmath71 since @xmath72 in general , we are performing a _ nonlinear _ background split here which causes the fields @xmath2 and @xmath73 to be different . in this respect the correspondence between the full and",
    "the conformally reduced theory is not perfect . in the full theory one",
    "performs the _ linear _ background split @xmath74 , integrates over @xmath75 , and defines @xmath76 . in the latter case there is no distinction between @xmath2 and @xmath77 : @xmath78    in [ i ] we explained in detail why , both in the full and the reduced theory , the background field is indispensable if one wants to implement `` background independence '' in the sense of @xcite and give a physical interpretation to the rg parameter @xmath3 .",
    "one expands the path integral in eigenmodes of the covariant laplacian @xmath79 which is constructed from @xmath59 and then introduces @xmath3 as a cutoff in the spectrum of @xmath79 . in this manner",
    "the typical length scale displayed by the @xmath79-eigenmode with eigenvalue @xmath80 , the `` last '' mode integrated out , is an approximate measure for the proper ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath59 ) coarse graining scale .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) cutoff is built into the path integral by adding an appropriate cutoff action @xmath81 $ ] to the bare action .",
    "it is a quadratic form in @xmath68 which involves a @xmath82-dependent integral kernel @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "( see [ i ] for further details . )    in the full theory , for vanishing ghost fields , the gravitational average action is a functional of the expectation value and the background field , respectively : @xmath84 \\equiv \\gamma_k [ g_{\\mu \\nu } , { \\overline}{g}_{\\mu \\nu}]$ ] . in the reduced setting , @xmath4 depends likewise on @xmath85 and @xmath82 or alternatively on @xmath86 and @xmath82 : @xmath87 \\equiv \\gamma_k [ \\phi , { \\chi_{\\text{b}}}]$ ] . even though it is kept fixed usually , it is sometimes important to keep in mind that @xmath4 also depends on the reference metric @xmath12 .",

    "we explained in detail how it has to be constructed in order to be `` background independent '' and to take account of the fact that the metric itself determines the proper coarse graining scale .",
    "the reference metric @xmath12 is unphysical and , in fact , has no counterpart in the full theory .",
    "a weyl rescaling of @xmath12 can always be absorbed by a suitable redefinition of the conformal factor .",
    "this is formalized by saying that the `` physical '' metrics @xmath54 , @xmath59 , @xmath2 , and @xmath73 are invariant under the following background ",
    "quantum field split symmetries :    [ 2.100 ] @xmath92 @xmath93    since the decomposition of @xmath54 as a conformal factor times @xmath12 is completely arbitrary , the quantum theory of the conformal factor must respect the split symmetry .",
    "in particular we require the cutoff action @xmath94 $ ] to be invariant under the `` @xmath95-transformations '' , as we shall call them .",

    "the relative simplicity of the resulting system of flow equations , a partial differential equation coupled to an ordinary one , allowed us detailed investigations which at present are prohibitively complicated in the full theory . while at first sight reminiscent of the rg equations for standard scalar theories , the requirement of a `` background independent '' quantization results in crucial differences . in the infinite dimensional space of potential functions we found both a gaussian and a non - gaussian fixed point ; they generalize the fixed points known from the ( conformally reduced ) einstein ",

    "we studied in detail the linearized rg flow near the ngfp and we found that for some choices of the space of scaling fields infinitely many relevant directions can arise .",

    " huang directions at the gfp of conventional scalar field theory . as to yet , their status and implications for the actual predictivity of the theory is not understood , not even in the case of standard scalars . at least in gravity",
    "the lpa is not sufficient in order to meaningfully address this question ; in particular it is unclear whether the halpern  huang - like scaling fields can descend from invariants built from the full metric which occur in the fixed point action .    in qeg the beta functions , by construction ,",

    ", we see no `` shadows '' of invariants with negative powers of the curvature . leaving aside the possibility of cancellations among invariants of the same dimension",
    ", this result suggests that terms of the form @xmath732 , @xmath733 , should not occur in rg trajectories on @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , recently machado and saueressig @xcite have analyzed @xmath734-parameter truncations where a single term of this type was added to the einstein ",

    "and indeed for moderate @xmath410 it turned out that on this @xmath734-dimensional theory space no satisfactory uv fixed point could be found . in the light of the present results",
    "the natural explanation which suggests itself is that the trajectories of @xcite are not on @xmath38 when the non - local invariant is included .",
    "the same remark applies to @xmath735 which produces a term @xmath736 which likewise grows faster than @xmath243 and , exactly as expected , spoils the ngfp .",
    "( the actual motivation in @xcite for including these invariants was the hope that they would improve the ir behavior , and this indeed turned out to be the case . )    in the opposite limit @xmath330 , the ngfp potential @xmath485 was found to be regular .",
    "we also saw that after appropriately constraining the scaling fields even the running potential @xmath279 is regular along all trajectories in @xmath38 .",
    "we can interpret this regularity by saying that @xmath373 contains no `` shadows '' of the invariants @xmath737 for @xmath738 .",
