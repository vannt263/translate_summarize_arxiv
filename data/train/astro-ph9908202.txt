    "the origin of extra solar cosmic rays ( cr ) is one of the important unresolved astrophysical questions .",
    "galactic shell type supernova remnants ( snr ) have been proposed as plausible acceleration sites for cosmic rays up to energies of several pev ( @xcite ) and - for very massive sn progenitors - to even higher energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently direct experimental evidence for electron acceleration in these objects has been found in the x - ray ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and tev @xmath8-ray range ( @xcite ) . somewhat surprisingly , similar searches for evidence of hadron acceleration have only yielded upper limits on the expected @xmath8-ray emission from the interaction of the hadrons with interstellar matter up to now ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . +",
    "an indirect approach to distinguish between different theoretical models aiming to describe the acceleration of charged cosmic rays ( cr ) is to measure the energy spectrum and composition of cr and compare the results with model predictions . here",
    "the energy regime around the so called `` knee '' between 1 and 10pev is especially interesting(@xcite ) . in this energy range the all - particle cr energy spectral slope - that is constant within measurement errors for lower energies - suddenly increases .",
    "the riddle of the origin of the knee and of the cosmic radiation with energies exceeding it , is not yet finally resolved .",
    "the following general solutions have been discussed : + 1 .",
    "the change in index is due to some propagation effect in an `` original '' cosmic - ray population that displays an unbroken power law from low energies up to energies above the knee .",
    "the most popular idea is that the energy dependence of the diffusion constant of cosmic rays in the galaxy could change in the knee region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . because of the dependence of the diffusion constant on the nuclear charge z a modest decrease in the fraction of `` light '' elements ( hydrogen and helium )",
    "would be expected . in the simplified chemical model we use below ( heavy elements modelled by 65 @xmath9 oxygen and 35 @xmath9 iron , light elements by 40 @xmath9 hydrogen and 60 @xmath9 helium ) the fraction of light elements",
    "would be expected to decrease from an assumed value of 60 % below the knee to 43 % above the knee .",
    "in such a model ( barring a special cancellation of effects ) the knee is expected to be a relatively smooth feature , extending over about a decade in energy .",
    "a principal problem with this approach is that no plausible galactic source of cosmic rays has been identified which is quantitatively capable of producing the `` original '' cosmic - ray population .",
    "the knee signals in some way the maximum energy for the sources responsible for low energy cosmic rays .",
    "the cosmic rays at higher energies could be `` re - accelerated '' low energy cosmic - rays , e.g. at the shock front of a galactic wind ( jokipii @xmath10 morfill 1987 ) or an ensemble of shock fronts in clusters of massive stars ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "a phenomenology similar to the diffusion model in the previous paragraph would be expected .",
    "alternatively , above the knee a completely new population of cosmic rays dominates . in this case typically",
    "dramatic changes in chemical composition are expected , e.g. to pure hydrogen in the extragalactical model of protheroe ( @xcite ) and nearly pure heavy elements ( fraction of light elements @xmath11 0.3 far above the knee ) in a model with special snrs by stanev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the special properties of these new sources could in principle allow to understand a knee relatively `` sharp '' in energy .",
    "+ to definitely discriminate between a composition changing as expected in models with an energy dependent diffusion constant ( discussed above under 1 . ) and an unchanging composition , it is necessary to achieve an error of smaller than @xmath4 10 @xmath9 in the experimental determination of the fraction of light elements in the total cosmic radiation above the knee . + while the cosmic - ray composition and energy spectrum are well known from direct balloon and space - borne observations up to energies of about 100tev , no general agreement has been reached at higher energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained for cr around the `` knee '' suffer seriously from the fact that due to the low flux of cr above 1pev , only large ground based installations observing the extensive air showers ( eas ) induced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere can provide experimental data",
    ". however the sensitivity of eas observables to the mass of the primary cr is weak .",
    "the analyses are rendered even more difficult due to theoretical uncertainties concerning the high energy interactions in the atmosphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ here we present an analysis of eas between 300tev and 10pev which restricts to observables related to the electromagnetic shower component . in the following sections the experimental setup ( section [ sec_exps ] ) , the monte - carlo simulations ( section [ sec_mc ] ) , the event reconstruction ( section [ sec_reco ] ) and analysis methods ( section [ sec_anal ] ) are described .",
    "sections6 presents the results concerning the cr energy spectrum and the coarse mass composition .",
    "a more detailed study of the systematic errors and a discussion of methods to analyse the composition without relying on the absolute penetration depth are discussed in section 7 .",

    "( 790g/@xmath5 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the present analysis",
    "only data of the scintillator array and part of the airobicc array were used .",
    "the former consists of 243 huts with plastic scintillators of an area of 0.96 m@xmath13 , covered with 5 mm of lead on a grid with 15 m spacing ( with a denser part with 10 m spacing in the centre of the array ) .",
    "the part of the latter used in this analysis is formed by 49 open photo - multipliers fitted with winston cones , restricting the viewed solid angle to 0.835 sr and measuring the air cherenkov light of eas on a grid with 30 m spacing .",
    "the gain nonlinearity of all components in the cherenkov - light measurement was carefully checked , both with a led light source with variable light intensity and a direct charge source .",
    "while the used cherenkov light photomultiplier tubes were found to be linear , the used amplifier showed an antilinearity ( gain rises with input amplitude ) which was corrected in the data analysis . above 10 pev",
    "the amplifier begin to show signs of saturation and therefore no data above 10 pev are included in the present analysis .",
    "the trigger conditions used for the data analysed here demand a signal from at least 14 scintillator or 6 airobicc stations within 150ns .",
    "this corresponds to an energy threshold for primary protons and iron nuclei of 25 and 80tev respectively .",
    "eas events were simulated using the corsika code in its versions 5.20 with the qgsjet / gheisha options ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ) .",
    "this generator is based on the quark - gluon string model ( qgs ) with an allowance for semihard processes ( jet ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "complex nuclei were treated with the `` complete fragmentation '' ansatz . the energy cutoff for particles of the electromagnetic cascade",
    "was set to 3mev .",
    "proton , helium , oxygen and iron induced showers were produced at zenith angles of 0@xmath14,6@xmath14 , 12@xmath14 and 18@xmath14 at discrete energies between 300tev and 10pev ( 4400 independent showers of which 1000 are above 1 pev ) as well as an independent sample with a continuous energy distribution at zenith angles of 6@xmath14 and 12@xmath14 between 50 tev and 1pev ( 4330 independent showers ) and following a power law of e@xmath15 between 2.5 pev and 6.5 pev ( 240 showers ) .",
    "the events continuously distributed in energy were spectrally weighted and used in the fits to infer the chemical composition ( section [ chempos ] ) , while the samples with discrete energies were employed to develop the reconstruction methods and to correct the results obtained with biased estimators of the primary energy ( section [ erecmethods ] ) .",
    "note that the simulation of an eas induced by a 1pev primary proton including the cherenkov light production requires about 3h cpu time on a 300mhz pentium - ii pc ( during the same time the hegra experiment registers more than 350 showers with energies larger than 1pev ) .",
    "+ the detector performance was modelled with two independent detector simulations : a full detector simulation ( @xcite ) , and an empirical simulation using measured response functions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "each independent generated eas was used 20 times with core positions inside and outside the hegra area to take into account the detector related fluctuations of observables and to check the event selection criteria . with the standard cuts described below , each shower was used on the average two times in the discrete and once in the continuous mc sample .",
    "+ special care has been taken to simulate the density profile and absorption features of the atmosphere above lapalma correctly .",
    "weather balloon measurements as well as comparisons between tev photon data registered by the hegra system of imaging air cherenkov telescopes and simulations were employed for this purpose ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "the shower development and light emission were modelled with the u.s .",
    "standard atmosphere , and the light propagation was then simulated with a special program elba ( @xcite ) , assuming a tropical maritime atmosphere for the summer .",
    "this atmosphere is a good approximation for the conditions at tenerife , an island neighbouring the experimental site ( @xcite ) .",
    "the core position of an eas is reconstructed independently from the data of the scintillator matrix and from airobicc where the latter data allow to tag core positions beyond the hegra boundary .",
    "if the core position lies inside the area covered with detector elements the scintillator derived core coordinates have a resolution of @xmath16 for protons ( iron ) at energies above 300tev ( a little more accurate compared to airobicc mainly due to the smaller grid distances of the scintillator huts ) .",
    "= 8.8 cm    the direction of the primary particle is reconstructed nearly independently from the scintillator and airobicc arrival time data ( where the scintillator derived core position is used here ) .",
    "+ the particle density measured by the scintillator array is fitted by the nkg formula ( @xcite ) with a molire radius of 106 m , yielding the shower size @xmath17 and an _ age _ value .",
    "@xmath17 is a factor @xmath181.6 larger than @xmath19 ( the `` true '' shower size at detector level , denoting the number of charged particles above a kinetic energy of 3mev ) due to coverage of the detector huts with a lead layer and the fact that the nkg function does not correctly parametrise the electromagnetic part of hadronic showers .",
    "+ the dependence of the cherenkov photon density @xmath20 , as measured by airobicc , on the distance r from the shower axis can be well described by an exponential in the region 20 m @xmath21r@xmath11100 m ( @xcite ) : @xmath22 the parameter _ slope _ ( in units of [ 1/m ] ) is the most important one in our analysis methods . as an illustration fig.[showerpic ] shows the lateral charged - particle and cherenkov - light distributions for a single shower .",
    "+ the amplitude calibration of the scintillator array is done for samples of 50000 events by comparing the adc spectra of the individual huts - which display a single peak essentially corresponding to the energy deposited by minimum ionising electrons and muons - with the result of mc simulations for identical conditions .",
    "the absolute amount of the air cherenkov light registered by airobicc was calibrated by comparing the energy inferred from the lateral cherenkov light density in the spectral range from 300 nm to 500 nm registered at a shower core distance of 90 m ( referred to as @xmath23 in the following ) and the energy derived from @xmath17 and _ slope _ in the interval @xmath24 ( refer to section [ erecmethods ] below for energy reconstruction methods ) .",
    "the absolute cherenkov - light calibration thus depends on the cr mass composition , because we do not apply a primary - mass independent energy reconstruction here .",
    "we used the low - energy composition at 100 tev as specified by wiebel - sooth et al.(@xcite ) ( 60 @xmath9 light elements , see below section [ chempos ] for details ) for this calibration .",
    "if a pure proton ( iron ) composition is assumed the energy reconstructed from cherenkov light alone is shifted by 3 ( 13)% to higher ( lower ) energies .",
    "+ to select well - reconstructed events the eas core positions and directions as reconstructed with airobicc and the scintillator matrix are demanded to be consistent .",
    "additional cuts ensure the quality of the directional as well as the fits to the lateral particle and cherenkov light density distributions . events with the true shower - core position within the hegra array boundaries for the detector components used in this analysis ( distance to edge of array @xmath25 10 m ) and a zenith angle below 15@xmath26 are used for the further analysis .",
    "the efficiency to select eas events with true core positions in the regarded 160@xmath12160m@xmath13 area is about 98% for primary energies above 300tev ( independent of the primary mass ) . the contamination of the sample with eas , where the true shower cores lay beyond the hegra boundary but which were erroneously reconstructed to fulfil the cuts is less than 1% from our simulations .",
    "+ nights with perfect weather conditions are selected by data of the carlsberg meridian cycle ( @xcite ) and by comparing the cherenkov light measurements with data from the scintillators for samples of 50000 events ( accumulated in about one hour with the used setup and trigger conditions ) .",
    "the data set solely contains nights without any technical problems of the used detector stations . in total",
    "it comprises ( dead - time corrected ) an on - time of 208h .",
    "this corresponds to about 150000 events after all cuts with an energy above about 100tev and a zenith angle below 15@xmath26 .",
    "monte carlo simulations revealed that the distance @xmath27 between detector and shower maximum ( defined as the point in the shower development with the maximal number of charged particles ) can be reconstructed independently of the primary mass with the shape parameter _",
    "slope _ of the lateral cherenkov light density distribution : @xmath28 { \\rm \\,g / cm^2}. \\label{dimax}\\ ] ] from this relation the distance to the shower maximum is determined with a resolution ( i.e. root mean square ( rms ) of a ( d@xmath29(true)-d@xmath30(reconstructed ) distribution ) ranging from 40g/@xmath5 at 300tev to 20g/@xmath5 at 10pev ( including all detector effects but no systematic error in the mean d@xmath29 ) .",
    "the most important technical improvement in the data presented here to previous experiments is that these values are distinctly smaller than the width of natural shower fluctuations of proton induced showers in the atmosphere ( see below table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this makes the shape of the penetration - depth distribution a sensitive parameter for the chemical composition ( see section [ sec_reli ] ) .",
    "simple geometrical relations permit to infer @xmath31 , the depth of the shower maximum in the atmosphere , from @xmath32 .",
    "relation [ dimax ] is only weakly energy dependent ( @xcite ) .",
    "this dependence is neglected here .",
    "methods have been developed to reconstruct the primary cr energy from the scintillator and airobicc data _ independently _ of the primary mass with an accuracy better than 35% ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , these methods lead to a relatively strong correlation between reconstructed energy and @xmath31 ( showers with a maximum position that fluctuated to smaller values compared to the mean @xmath31 , are reconstructed with higher energies ) . in order to infer the chemical composition , a careful modelation of the response function between the variables @xmath17 ( or @xmath23 ) and _ slope _ on the one hand and energy and composition ( or penetration depth ) on the other hand ( e.g. via two - dimensional regularised unfolding ) is then necessary .",
    "such procedures have been employed in some analyses of hegra data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "two reasons lead us to prefer to circumvent the mentioned problem with the use of two simpler energy estimators here .",
    "+ one reason is that the methods described below are based on physically transparent properties of air - showers inferred from the monte - carlo simulations . whether these properties really hold , is tested to some degree using different energy estimators with different biases and comparing the obtained results .",
    "these consistency checks are an important advantage over more refined and complete methods when it is doubtful how well the monte - carlo simulation describes the data .",
    "the other reason is that the monte carlo statistics at the highest energy is still rather limited and mean shower properties are inferred with higher certainty than a complete response matrix .",
    "the mass independent energy reconstruction methods will be applied to the data in a forthcoming publication together with a discussion of the influence of different eas simulations .",
    "the energy estimators used in this paper and described below are based on @xmath33 and _ slope _ , or @xmath34 .",
    "both estimators are used under the assumption that all primary cr are either protons or iron nuclei .",
    "these extreme assumptions lead to a bias which then has to be corrected for .",
    "+ using @xmath33 and _ slope _ the energy of the primary cosmic - ray nucleus is reconstructed in two basic steps here ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) : first _ slope _ ( a measure of the distance to the shower maximum ) is combined with @xmath33 to estimate the number of particles in the shower maximum which is proportional to the energy contained in the electromagnetic component of the eas . in the second step a specific primary mass",
    "is assumed ; with the assumption of primary proton ( iron ) we denote the methods as 1 ( 2 ) .",
    "this allows to calculate the primary energy from the energy deposited in the electromagnetic component .",
    "the following relation was used in our analysis : @xmath35 ) = a \\cdot log(n_s({\\rm max } ) ) + b.\\ ] ] here @xmath36 were obtained from the discrete monte carlo data as 0.965,@xmath372.545 ( 0.890,@xmath372.010 ) for protons ( iron ) .",
    "@xmath38 is the shower size at the maximum of shower development and is inferred from @xmath17 as : @xmath39 with @xmath40 given as ( 0.57833,-85.146,6181.8,-71054 ) for all primary nuclei .",
    "this procedure is valid because the shape of the shower development is only weakly dependent on the mass of the cr nucleus a , especially after the shower maximum ( @xcite ) .",
    "only the fraction of the total energy fed into the electromagnetic cascade depends on a for a given energy per nucleus .",
    "the comparison of the results assuming initially proton and iron primaries is a consistency check for the dependence of shower size at the maximum of shower development on the energy per nucleon .",
    "+ alternatively the energy is reconstructed from the airobicc data alone ( method 3 ( 4 ) with the assumption of proton ( iron ) primaries ) . here",
    "it turns out that @xmath23 is a good estimator of the energy contained in the electromagnetic eas cascades . from simulations",
    "the relation @xmath41 ) = a \\cdot log(l_{\\rm 90}[{\\rm photons / m^2 } ] ) + b\\ ] ] was derived , where the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given as 0.958,@xmath371.810 ( 0.840,@xmath371.061 ) for primary protons ( iron ) .",
    "_ slope _ ( the parameter used to estimate the primary mass composition , see next section ) is not involved in this energy reconstruction .",
    "for ease of reference the four energy - reconstruction methods are summarised in table [ taberec ] .",
    ".summary of the energy reconstruction methods 1 - 4 as discussed in the text . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the last two of these publications , we tried to lessen the dependence of our composition result on the correct absolute @xmath31 values by allowing a free `` shift parameter '' ; the fit to the @xmath31 was then performed with two free parameters : the ratio of light to all nuclei and an overall shift in penetration depth of all mc distributions . in this way the result is mainly determined by the _",
    "shape _ of the @xmath31 distributions ( in first order its width , i.e. rms value ) .",
    "this width depends only weakly on a systematic uncertainty in the determination of _ slope _ , relative to the expected difference of a purely light or heavy composition .",
    "+ fig.[d2chi ] displays the result of such an attempt in a two dimensional plot showing the reduced @xmath44 for various `` fraction of light nuclei '' - `` shift parameter '' combinations for the data lowest and highest in energy .",
    "the shift is varied in an interval @xmath4 30 g/@xmath5 , estimated from the likely systematic uncertainty of our detector and the monte carlo code .",
    "while in the low energy bin small ( p+@xmath45)/all ratios lead to unsatisfactory @xmath44 values for all shift values , in the highest energy bin - well above the knee - practically all fractions give acceptable @xmath44 values for appropriate shifts as seen in fig.[d2chi ] .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that - given the small number of events in the high - energy bin - the @xmath31 distribution can be fitted both with the relatively broad predominantly light composition shifted to larger depths in the atmosphere and a mixed heavy/ light composition ( where the difference in mean penetration depth of the heavy and light component contributes to the total width ) shifted to small penetration depth .",
    "we have to conclude that it is not reliably possible to determine the composition based mainly on the width of the @xmath31 distribution .",
    "we found in numerical experiments that with this method , and assuming a monte - carlo simulation describing the experimental data well , together with a statistics increased by about a factor of 100 ( which is difficult but not impossible to reach in future experiments ) it will just be possible to reach the desired precision of 10 % mentioned in the introduction on a 2@xmath46 level beyond the knee .",
    "the results of this paper demonstrate that our data seem to be well described by the qgsjet hadron generator within the corsika program : the energy spectra derived with different air - shower observables and assumptions about the chemical composition of cr differ only within the estimated systematic errors .",
    "this is an argument in favour of the contention that the `` knee '' is a feature in the primary flux of cosmic rays , rather than some new effect in the interaction of cosmic rays at very high energies .",
    "such a new effect would probably lead to inconsistencies in the data analysed by a generator that does not take them into account .",
    "+ up to the knee we find a mixed composition and an energy - spectrum power law index consistent with the results of direct experiments at energies around 100 tev .",
    "the data favour a gradual enrichment in heavy elements at energies above the knee but the systematic errors of our experiment do not allow to rule out a constant composition .",
    "an abrupt change of composition or a substantial enrichment in light elements at the knee is ruled out .",
    "we find an elongation rate of about 78 g/@xmath5 and a mean penetration depth consistent with other experimental data on cr with energies higher than studied here ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thank the instituto de astrofisica de canarias ( iac ) and the orm observatory for support and excellent working conditions .",
