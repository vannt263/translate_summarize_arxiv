    "a tidal disruption event ( tde ) by a massive black hole ( mbh ) occurs when a star comes closer than its tidal radius ( approximately given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass of the mbh , @xmath2 is the mass of the star and @xmath3 is its radius ) .",
    "the star is then pulled apart by the tidal forces by the mbh , part of its material is ejected away and part is accreted on the mbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the explosive disruption itself , and the later accretion on the mbh likely give rise to transient energetic phenomena potentially observable ( with more than ten potential detections to date ) with current and future telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "mbhs are thought to exist in a significant fraction of all galactic nuclei . due to their high mass ( @xmath4 )",
    ", they dominate the gravitational potential in the nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) which typically host them ( at least at the @xmath5 @xmath6 mbh mass regime ) ; the orbits of stars in the central parsecs around mbhs are therefore governed by the potential of the mbhs .",
    "the long - term dynamical evolution of the stars in the region of influence of the mbh is also determined by their interactions and mutual gravitational scatterings with other stars in the nsc .",
    "these can be modeled using a fokker - planck ( fp ) approach to describe the diffusive behavior of stars in nsc .",
    "( @xcite ) , where the close approaches of stars to the mbh leading to their tidal disruption can be modeled as a sink - term in the fp equations .",
    "tde rates calculated following such an approach typically give rise to rates of the order of @xmath7 up to @xmath8 per galaxy in the local universe , assuming some steady state condition of the nsc ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .    since the 1980 s tidal disruption of stars by mbhs were suggested to occur in galactic nuclei and produce luminous transient events with unique signatures @xcite .",
    "the signatures can teach us both on the dynamics in galactic nuclei as well as on the conditions very close to mbhs , and their properties .",
    "such tdes have since been extensively studied theoretically , and a significant observational effort has been put in their detection @xcite .",
    "many studies have estimated the rates of tdes ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) in the local universe , and several estimates have been derived based on direct observations of tde - candidates in recent years ( @xcite ) . since the structure and the properties of nscs vary with time , it is expected that the tde rates will change accordingly .",
    "moreover , the change of tde rates can be used as a proxy for characterizing the properties of nscs and/or the history of the build - up of mbhs and nscs in the universe . in particular",
    ", future deep surveys may allow the detection of tdes from earlier stages of cosmological evolution arising from younger galaxies , and potentially provide a handle on the tde history @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution of tde rates with time and their dependence on the nsc and star - formation history and evolution have been little studied .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the tdes history ( tdh ) by studying the rate of tidal disruption of stars in nscs .",
    "we simulate the evolution of nscs in several types of galaxies by fp analysis as well as n - body simulations .",
    "we obtain the tde rates as a function of their evolutionary history , and find that they are affected by the nsc structure and its build - up history . by integrating the tde rates from galaxies of each type we obtain the total galaxy averaged tdh of the universe expected to be observed .",
    "we thereby provide a first global estimate of the tdh accounting for nsc build - up , albeit with simple models .    in the following we begin by a brief description of the fokker - planck analysis and n - body simulations of evolving clusters .",
    "we describe our approach of evaluating a sink term from fp analysis for calculating the tidal disruption rate .",
    "we then present the tdh and its dependence on the mbh mass and the nsc build - up history in different types of galaxies . finally , we consider the global , galaxy averaged , tdh of the universe evaluated by integrating the tde rates arising from the different types of galaxies ( and their correspondent evolutionary histories ) and relevant mbh masses .",
    "we note , that our model is based on typical nscs that undergo basic processes and their dynamics are dominated by two - body relaxation . the model can be expanded , and future works may include other processes and properties in nsc such as non uniform stellar mass , self - consistent potential , non - spherical nscs etc . here",
    "we provide a first study of the history of tdes using simple models .",
    "in our work we explore the tidal disruption rates in nscs through their evolution in time .",
    "we focus on simple , spherical nscs that evolve through in - situ star formation ( sf ) @xcite , and study other cases of nscs that are built - up through consecutive infalls of massive clusters or evolve from a pre - existing stellar cusp . the main analysis method used in our work",
    "is based on the numerical solution of the fp equation , complemented by n - body simulations of nscs evolution .",
    "our model includes a stellar cluster , the nsc , harboring a central mbh .",
    "it focuses on the stars in the central few parsecs of the nsc , and in particular in the range between the tidal radius - @xmath9 below which regular stars are disrupted by the mbh , and the radius of influence where the stellar motions are dominated by the mbh potential , defined by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the typical radius and mass of stars in the nsc , respectively ; and @xmath13 is the velocity dispersion of stars just outside the nsc . for @xmath14 the original model following ( *",
    "* hereafter bw ) assumes the existence of a `` thermal bath '' which supplies stars to the inner region of the galactic nucleus .",
    "the stellar orbits within @xmath15 are assumed to be keplerian in this range .",
    "the relaxation time , that dominates the timescale of the stellar cluster , is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stellar density , and @xmath18 is the coulomb logarithm , a factor which is related to the scale of the system ( @xmath19 .",
    "the fp model , extensively used in our work , consists of a time and and energy - dependent , angular momentum - averaged particle conservation equation .",
    "it has the form :    @xmath20    where @xmath21    the term @xmath22 $ ] is related to the stellar flow , and plays an important role in the evolution of the stellar cluster .",
    "it presents the flow of stars in energy space due to two - body relaxation , it is defined by :    @xmath23    the addition of the source term that represents the sf has the form :    @xmath24    @xmath25 is a rectangular function , which boundaries correspond to the region where new stars are assumed to from ; @xmath26 is the source term amplitude ; and @xmath27 is a power - law function with a slope @xmath28 , defining the sf distribution in phase space . for a detailed description of the fokker - planck analysis see @xcite where the same analysis was used for studying the evolution of nscs with in - situ sf .",
    "note that the sink term @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fokker_planck ] is used for evaluating the tidal disruption rates in our models .",
    "this term represents stars with energies in the interval @xmath30 that flow into the mbh ( mostly due to angular momentum change ; the sink - term represent the effective loss in energy space ; see @xcite ) , and are therefore lost from the system ( see @xcite for detailed overview of loss cone analysis ) .    for modeling tidal disruption through n - body simulations ,",
    "we follow the same methods and similar assumptions , as well as make the same use of the same code in @xcite and @xcite , where the tde rates are evaluated . for a detailed method explanation along with the initial conditions of the infalling clusters and tdes estimation ,",
    "see @xcite . in brief , we run direct n - body simulations ( using the @xmath31grape code , @xcite ) of the consecutive infall and merging of a set of 12 single - mass globular clusters each with mass of @xmath32 m@xmath33 , inspiralling from a galactocentric distance of 20pc .",
    "in our study , we explore the tdh through two formation / evolutionary models of nscs : in - situ star formation and cluster infall .",
    "the study is done by using the fp analysis to simulate an evolving nsc with an addition of extra source term ( see @xcite for the full analysis ) . in the in - situ sf model we consider two possible cases : nscs that are entirely built - up from the in - situ sf , and nscs that evolve from an initial steady state bw distribution ( hereinafter `` built - up sf '' origin and `` primordial cusp origin '' , respectively ) . in both of the scenarios , the initial density profile is determined from an arbitrary initial distribution function ( df ) . for the bound stars inside the radius of influence in the primordial cusp scenario",
    "the df takes the form of @xmath34 ( corresponding to the bw steady - state cusp which has the form of @xmath35 ) .",
    "the normalization of the number density at the radius of influence for each scenario is given in table [ table_dens_mbh_mass ] .",
    "we consider different masses for the hosted mbh in their centers , where the density profiles of the nscs are normalized in the same way as done in @xcite ( 2004 ) , where the parameters were taken from typical galaxies ( e.g. ngc 4551/4621 ) . the velocity dispersion ( is evaluated from the m - sigma relation : @xmath36 , @xcite .",
    ".density profile at @xmath15 of nscs for different mbh masses [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_dens_mbh_mass ]    in the built - up sf scenario the initial df is evaluated according to the term @xmath27 ( eq . [ eq : sf_sourcet ] ) , where the initial number density is equal to the added number density every time step . for both of the scenarios , the chosen slope of the sf function",
    "is motivated by the observed power - law ( @xcite ) distribution of young stars observed in the young stellar disk in the gc .",
    "the df of the unbound stars ( @xmath37 has the form of a maxwellian distribution .",
    "we study the tde rates throughout the evolution of nscs and for each scenario we tested several types of sf history corresponding to the galaxy type studied ( see section [ sub : tdes - in - different ] ) .",
    "though we use the fp approach for our modeling of the tdh , we also complement our analysis with n - body simulations of the cluster - infall scenario . as discussed later on",
    ", we find that models of in - situ sf in the outer regions of an nsc evolve very similarly to those of cluster infall , since the clusters shed their material in the same regions , effectively providing a source term similar to that arising from sf . therefore our models of in - situ sf in the outer regions of an nsc effectively well capture models of cluster - infall , at least in terms of the tde rates under the assumptions made in our study .",
    "we followed the evolution of several types of galaxies with different sf scenarios . for each type of galaxy and",
    "sf scenario we evaluated the tde rates and their evolution .",
    "we considered the following simplified cases : ( 1 ) an elliptical galaxy with sf occurring only at the early stages of the evolution of the nsc ; and ( 2 ) spiral galaxy with either continuous sf or repeating bursts of sf occurring throughout the evolution of the nsc to present days .",
    "the correspondence between galaxy type and its typical sf history follows . we used a simplified model to describe the non - continuous sf star - burst scenario , where we assume the bursts occur at equally spaced time intervals ( gyr ) , at ten times the rate of the continuous sf models , but only for 100 myrs ( as to have the same total sf averaged rate ) .",
    "we summarize the types of galaxies and the sf scenarios simulated in our work in table [ tab : galaxies_prop ] .",
    "note , that we also study different scenarios for the regions where sf may occur ; either in the range between @xmath38 or in the range @xmath39 from the mbh .",
    "the ranges that were chosen for sf in our work are motivated by the observed existence of a possibly star - forming circumnuclear gaseous disk in the range of 2 - 5pc in the galactic center ( similar young stellar populations are observed in other galactic nuclei , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most of the presented sf scenarios are based on these observations .",
    "the close - in sf region ( @xmath40 ) is motivated by the existence of a nuclear stellar disk of young stars very close to the mbh in the galactic center ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the averaged rates of sf were set to @xmath41 , motivated by the observed number of stars in the central parsecs of galactic nuclei , as to obtain a total mass of @xmath42m@xmath33 comparable to the masses of nscs derived from observations of the gc and extragalactic nscs ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we note that the range of of @xmath38 is also representative of the range where a disrupted cluster dispenses its stars close to the mbh , thereby building - up the nsc stellar population ( e.g. @xcite ; the exact cluster tidal radius depends on the mbh and nsc mass and could have a slightly larger range ) . finally , we also considered different rates of sf in the nsc to access their overall effects on the tdh .",
    "all models used are summarized in table 1 .",
    "note that bursting sf models where sf occurs in the outer regions also serve as good proxies for the cluster infall model , as we discuss later on .",

    "each studied mass of mbh the appropriate relaxation time corresponding to the velocity dispersion ( evaluated from m - sigma relation , @xcite ) was determined , and used to produce the primordial clusters considered in the relevant models .",
    "the rates of tidal disruptions were then evaluated throughout the nsc evolution .",
    "the evolution of nscs hosting mbhs of higher masses is not discussed in this work , since the tidal radius for ms stars falls below the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore , mbh with higher masses would not contribute to the tde rates of typical main - sequence stars .",
    "lower mass mbhs may also exist , though there is little observational evidence for their current existence , but this is likely due to current observational limitations .",
    "nevertheless , such low mass mbhs may give rise to tdes with significantly different observational signatures , and we therefore limit our study only to more massive mbhs .",
    "the disruption rates of stars by mbhs depend both on the nsc properties as well as on several possible physical processes .",
    "these processes include for example the presence of massive perturbers , that refill the loss cone ( e.g. @xcite ) , the evolution of central mbhs binaries and the effects of non spherically symmetric potentials in the nucleus ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "some of these processes are efficient in increasing the tde rates , but typically operate only on short timescales ( e.g. binary mbh mergers ) , while the level of non - sphericity of galactic nuclei is not well known .",
    "our model focuses the tdes for number of sf scenarios including different rates and different ranges .",
    "a similar tde history model was suggested by @xcite whose work was based on different evolution scenarios of nscs which does not include sf .",
    "a comparison between merritt s work and this study results is discussed in section [ sub : cluster - infall - and sf ] .",
    "another important assumption is that the mbhs in our models evolve and change their mass .",
    "this change is done by adding the mass of the disrupted stars to the mbh during the evolution of an nsc .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the growth of the mbh mainly affects the tde rates in the lower rates of sf scenarios and for initial low masses of mbh , in which cases the total added mass becomes comparable to the initial mass of the mbh . in these cases ,",
    "the tde rates decline with time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution - of - tde_lower - rates - sf ] ) , while the tde rates grow with time for the more massive mbhs .",
    "we continuously change the nsc structure up to the radius of influence according to the evolution of the fp models .",
    "as the mass of the mbh grows we change the velocity dispersion @xmath13 assuming the m-@xmath48 relation holds at any given time .",
    "the radius of influence ( eq . [ eq : r_h ] ) is then changed according to the updated mass and velocity dispersion , and the outer boundary condition of the thermal bath also change accordingly , following @xcite .",
    "we note and caution that this is not a trivial assumption ; its advantage is in consistently relating the mbh , the velocity dispersion and the stellar density outside the nsc , and therefore , by definition producing a final nsc and environmental configuration which is in accordance with the observed @xmath49 relation today ( though the relation is defined in the context of the velocity dispersion at larger radii ) .",
    "the disadvantage is in using an ad - hoc assumption in which the @xmath49relation is continuously kept at all times ; whether this holds is currently unknown . to the best of our knowledge",
    "previous studies used either a constant outer boundary conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or had self - consistently evolving open outer boundaries @xcite ; in this latter case the initial conditions determined the velocity dispersion and the density in the nsc outer region .",
    "since no additional boundary conditions or an outer thermal bath were introduced , the conditions in the outer regions ( where relaxation is slow ) hardly changed ( see below ) , and the nscs was effectively described as isolated system , unrelated to the larger scale evolution of the galaxy .",
    "thereby it could not reproduce a configuration based on the @xmath49 relation today , unless arbitrarily put by hand as initial conditions .",
    "given these limitations and the debated understanding of mbh feedback and the origin of the @xmath49 relation , we believe the ad - hoc assumption we use is quite reasonable , and compared with other choices it introduces a plausible relation between the nsc and the larger scale environment consistent with current observations .",
    "* *    our modeling accounts for the nsc stellar population ( the density profile ) up to the radius of influence in the evolving nsc , while the stellar population outside the region is assumed to be consistent with the large scale galactic bulge , as described above .",
    "we assume the potential is dominated by the mbh and neglect the contribution from the stellar population of the nsc , i.e. the contribution of the stellar component up to the radius of influence is neglected , similar to the original bw study . up to the radius of influence",
    "this simplifying assumption is justified , while far from the mbh it breaks down . nevertheless , at these regions the relaxation time becomes larger than the hubble time , and the background does not change due to the nsc internal evolution .",
    "the intermediate regions beyond the radius of influence , in which relaxation time can still be significantly shorter than a hubble time are small , and therefore our simplified modeling should still well capture the overall dynamics of the nsc .    for our final integrated tdh results ( see section [ sub : a - global - model ] ) , we extended the range of mbhs masses between @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 by using the interpolated power - law function that describes the dependence between tde rates and mbh mass ( eq . [ eq : integ_fin_eq ] ) .",
    "we do not consider tdes from lower mass mbhs , or tdes of evolved stars , which could be relevant even for mbhs above this mass range .",
    "here we only consider simple models of spherical nscs hosting non - evolving mbhs of given masses with relaxation dominated by two - body scattering of low mass ( sun - like ) stars .",
    "other models are beyond the scope of this initial study and will be explored elsewhere .",
    "stellar clusters infalling into the nuclear regions are typically disrupted and shed their stars at scales of a few pc from the galactic center , due to their disruption by the potential of the mbh and the existing nsc ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is also evidence for star - formation , young stellar populations and dense star - forming clumps in these regions ( e.g. the nuclear stellar disk in the galactic center , and young stellar populations in many galactic nuclei , @xcite ) .",
    "together , these suggest that both in - situ sf and cluster infall scenarios give rise to a source term of stars in regions at a few pc from the mbh . in the following",
    "we present the results of fp calculations , where star - formation / cluster infall scenarios are assumed to introduce new stars , a `` source term '' in the fp models , in the regions between 2 - 3.5 pc .",
    "note that we use the term sf throughout the following discussion , but it effectively also represents a source term of stars from infalling clusters .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , we have explored the tde rates as a function of the sf rate and characteristics .",
    "figures [ fig : cusp_3_galaxies_low_rate ] and [ fig : sf_3_galaxies_high_rate ] show the evolution of the tde rates with time for various models of the nscs .",
    "as expected , the tde rates grow with time as the nsc stellar population and the density of the nscs increase due to star - formation .",
    "the early times tde rates in the models of early star - formation ( ellipticals ) are significantly higher than the corresponding rates in the models with long term sf ( spirals ) . however , at later times the nscs in both cases saturate to similar levels as the nscs reach similar densities at late times ( in cases of the same total cumulative sf throughout the evolution ) .",
    "the tde rates in nscs with initial primordial cusps are generally higher , since the overall stellar populations are larger .",
    "the rise in the tde rates is not linear as in the built - up nscs models as relaxation processes are more pronounced already at early stages . since typical relaxation times",
    "are longer than the length of sf bursts in our models , it is not surprising that the sf bursts models behave very similarly to those with continuous sf ( with same averaged sf rates ) .",
    "henceforth we omit the results for sf burst models , which are essentially the same as those in the continuous sf models .",
    "the high sf during the first gyr in the elliptical galaxies models give rise to a significant increase of the stellar population in the nsc , and correspondingly leads to shorter relaxation times , and higher densities . in turn",
    "the tde rates rapidly increase during this epoch , due to these effects , and the increase becomes shallower only at later times after the end of the sf epoch .",
    "nevertheless , the rates continue to grow in time even after 10 gyr of evolution as stars from the galaxy slowly diffuse into the nsc . in the spiral galaxy models",
    "sf is continuous throughout the evolution , and the tde rates similarly increase in a more continuous manner .",
    "in addition to the comparison between tdes in different types of galaxies , we compare the tde rates for different masses of mbhs ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "we present the behavior of each scenario and for each of the mbh masses along with the evolution of the total mass of the nsc ; see figures [ fig : mbh_tde1 ] and [ fig : mbh_tde2 ] .",
    "these probe the dependence of the tde rates on the mass of the mbhs .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the tde rates decrease with the mass of the mbh .",
    "this result has already been discussed by @xcite , and can be well understood from loss cone analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have discussed the evolution of tde rates with time in the case of a non - sf nsc .",
    "though our models always include sf , the evolution of models of pre - existing nscs in which only an early sf epoch occurs , evolve very similarly to the models explored in @xcite , after the end of the sf .",
    "such models generally predict a global decrease of tde rates over time . . a different trend exists in the evolution of tde rates in models with long - term sf , in which the tde rates slowly increase with time as the nsc keeps growing due to sf .",
    "[ fig : evolution - of - tde_lower - rates - sf ] shows the tde rates for the models with lower sf rates and low mbh masses .",
    "note that in the models with mbhs masses of @xmath43 and @xmath53 the tde rates decay with time . in these cases",
    "the restive increase in the mbh mass significantly increase the relaxation time leading to lower tde rates , even though the total masses of the nscs increase .",
    "in addition to the tdh presented above , corresponding to sf at a distance of @xmath54 , we also studied the tdh in a different scenario , where sf is assumed to mainly occur in the inner regions of nscs .",
    "evidence for such more nucleated sf can be found in our own galaxy , where a young stellar population is observed in the inner @xmath55pc near the mbh ; though it is not clear if such sf is typical ( such regions can not yet be resolved in other galaxies ) , we consider this possibility for completeness .",
    "we * * followed the same conditions used in the previous scenarios , but we changed the range of sf to correspond to distances of @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ fig : tdes - diff_rng ] presents the tdes history for sf rate of @xmath56 and @xmath57 for elliptical and spiral galaxies , respectively . on the right panel",
    "we notice a different behavior * * of the tdh for elliptical galaxy compared with the outskirt sf scenarios : while there is a rapid growth in the disruption rates during the epoch of sf , the rates decreases with time once the * * sf process is quenched . since the stellar densities increase on relatively short times as many stars are formed close to the mbh , the nsc is initially far from its steady state configuration .",
    "the inner regions are `` over - populated '' and relaxation processes take time to redistribute these stars throughout the nsc . since stars in these regions are more susceptible to being tidally disrupted ( larger loss cone ) , the tde rates increase rapidly , before the nsc structure re - equilibrates .",
    "the long - term sf occurring in spiral galaxies allows for relaxation processes to redistribute the stars , and the tde rates increase more slowly , as the nsc is built - up .",
    "in addition to the tdhs of nscs evolving through an early sf epoch or through continuous sf ( described in table [ tab : galaxies_prop ] ) , we also studied models in which the sf follows the global universal sf history ( i.e. ) in such global models early sf is more significant , and then it gradually decrease by an order of of magnitude ( ) .",
    "such models are therefore expected to be more similar to the early sf epoch models ( `` elliptical galaxies '' ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution - of - tde - global ] we show the results from thee models , which confirm these expectations ; these models show similar trends as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution - of - tde - global ] .          following the cluster infall study ( described in @xcite ) , we evaluated the disruption rates of stars based on data obtained from n - body simulations .",
    "this provides us with a complimentary approach to the fp calculations , through a different type of analysis .",
    "as we show in the following the fp calculation for models with sf in the nsc outskirts and the calculations based on n - body data are generally comparable .",
    "note that the n - body calculations are computationally expensive , and therefore we show only a single case , while our general main results ( shown in the previous sections ) are based on the fp calculations .",
    "note that direct calculation of the tde rates from an n - body simulation requires appropriate resolution , number of particles and calibration .",
    "we have followed a more simplified approach where the n - body simulations only provide us with the effective radial density profile at any given point in time , from which we then calculate the tde rate semi - analytically , similar to the approach used in mastrobuono - battisti , perets & loeb ( 2014 ) .",
    "this avoids the obstacles arising from the direct calculations of tde rates in n - body simulations , at the cost of a less accurate result , and the use of the simplifying assumption of an isotropic distribution .    in the cluster - infall scenario clusters",
    "are added to the system on equally spaced time intervals .",
    "they then inspiral and disrupt , and their stars build - up the nsc .",
    "to a large extent this is captured by the fp models which introduce stars in the nsc outskirts ; since the infalling clusters disperse in the same distance scales ( few pcs ) , they introduce stars in the same manner as assumed in these fp models .",
    "we therefore compare the result of these two scenarios in figure [ fig : n - body_rand_fp ] .",
    "as can be seen , both scenarios provide very similar results , suggesting that the fp calculations can also be used to model the cluster - infall scenario .    ]",
    "as described in the previous sections , we have followed the evolution of the disruption rates of stars for different types of galaxies and evolutionary / sf - history scenarios . combining the rates we obtained for each galaxy type with the observational information about the fraction of each morphological galaxy type can provide a general prediction for the tdh of the universe .",
    "this analysis is done as follows ; for each type of hosted mbh mass we obtain the global tdh by integrating the rates we obtained for the different galaxies and mbh mass , weighted by their relative fraction    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the tde rate for the @xmath60-th galaxy type with an mbh of mass @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is its fraction of such galaxies in the local universe . the data for the fraction of each galaxy type is taken from observations ( @xcite ) and the mbh mass function is based on @xcite .",
    "note that in practice we use a sum over the mbh masses for which we have made the full calculation , rather than a continuous mass function .",
    "we generally find that the tde rate dependence on the mbh mass goes approximately as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "we separate the rate dependence results for each galaxy type , and find that the mbh mass goes as @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , for elliptical and spiral galaxies respectively .",
    "these findings of lower tde rates obtained for higher mass mbhs are not surprising and have already been seen and discussed in depth in other studies .",
    "previous models had not considered continuous sf , however our models for early burst of sf ( elliptical galaxies ) with no later sf are the most comparable . indeed in those cases we find consistent results ; @xmath65 ; where the range of the power law dependence found in previous studies is @xmath67 ( e.g. @xcite ) .     and @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig : integrated_mass_total ] ]",
    "in our work we provide a first theoretical study of the tde rate history which considers star - formation and cluster infall scenarios as models for nuclear stellar cluster formation and evolution .",
    "we find that in most scenarios the tde rates grow with time , due to the growth of the nscs stellar density during their evolution , where the tde rates decrease inversely with the mass of the mbh they host .",
    "we explored two different origins of the nsc : pre - existing nsc cusp that forms very early in the galaxy evolution or an nsc that grows more slowly through star formation or cluster infalls .",
    "nscs with primordial cusps have initially larger stellar populations .",
    "the overall tde rates they produce are therefore higher than those calculated for the cases of nsc which are built - up on longer timescales , and they are non - negligible already at early times .",
    "consideration of different types of sf histories , corresponding to elliptical and spiral galaxies , also show a similar trend : the earlier the sf occurs ( e.g. in elliptical where most sf is assumed to occur at the first gyr ) , the faster the nsc is built , and the faster the tde rates increase .",
    "we also compared our disruption rates for nscs with sf which occurs in the inner parsec , and found that in such sf scenarios a the tde histories show a different behavior where : during the sf epoch the tde rates rapidly grow , but then decrease and decay to a much lower level on a timescale of a few gyrs .    finally , to complement our main results from the fokker - planck models",
    ", we also modeled the tdh using data from full n - body simulations of the cluster - infall scenario .",
    "we found a good match between these rates and the fp results corresponding to a source term of stars in the nsc outskirts , further confirming the more simplified fp analysis .",
    "our results are mainly based on simple 1d fokker - planck models .",
    "although these appear to be able to well capture the results of n - body simulations ( at least for the cluster - infall scenario modeled through n - body simulations ) , they did not include a detailed galaxy merger history , and more complex non - spherical structures of nscs .",
    "the role of these aspects and their effects on the tdh are not well determined , and should be considered in future work    future surveys of tdes ( e.g. using the lsst data ) would be able to provide not only better estimate of the tde rates in the local universe , and their dependence on the host galaxy , but also the history of tdes . as we have shown here , the tdh can provide us with information on the overall evolution of nuclear stellar clusters and the star - formation history and properties in galactic nuclei through the combination of the observational data and the theoretical studies .",
    "we would like to thank clovis hopman for the use of the basic components in his fp code for developing the fp code used in our simulations .",
    "we would also like to especially thank the anonymous referee for important comments and suggestions that considerably improved the manuscript .",

    "<S> the tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole ( mbh ) is thought to produce a transient luminous event . </S>",

    "<S> we use a 1d fokker - planck approach to explore the evolution of mbh - hosting nscs , and obtain the disruption rates of stars during their evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we complement these with an analysis of tdes history based on n - body simulation data , and find them to be comparable . </S>",
    "<S> we consider nscs that are built - up from close - in star - formation ( sf ) or from sf / clusters - dispersal far - out , a few pc from the mbh . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore cases where primordial nscs exist and later evolve through additional star - formation / cluster - dispersal processes . </S>",
    "<S> we study the dependence of the tde history on the type of galaxy , as well as the dependence on the mbh mass . </S>",
    "<S> these provide several scenarios , with a continuous increase of the tde rates over time for cases of far - out sf and a more complex behavior for the close - in sf cases . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we integrate the tde histories of the various scenarios to provide a total tde history of the universe , which can be potentially probed with future large surveys ( e.g. lsst ) . </S>"
