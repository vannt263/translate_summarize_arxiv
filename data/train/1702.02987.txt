    "higher magnetic anisotropy makes the system stable by getting rid of thermal fluctuation of spins .",
    "the problem associated with higher pma is higher coercivity .",
    "this offers a new challenge for writing the media within the limited field of the existing write heads . to circumvent the problem , heat assisted magnetic recording has been investigated , where the magnetic anisotropy is tailored to be locally weak by laser heating to switch the media with a lower external magnetic field . however , the implementation of this method in a portable device is not very straight forward .",
    "so , the search for different methods of anisotropy tuning by external perturbations has gained an active interest of contemporary research .",
    "gdfe is a very popular material system due to its interesting property of tunable pma in amorphous as - deposited condition .",
    "it has been the centre of attraction of the research community around the globe since last few decades due to its applicability in magneto optical recording .",
    "the reason behind the evolution of pma and reverse spin re - orientation transition ( srt ) with respect to film thickness and temperature has still been debated . from the existing literature , the contribution of the magnetic dipolar interaction behind the determination of pma can be evidenced  @xcite .",
    "the role of structural parameters and their correlations to the magnetic properties have been discussed there .",
    "the surface srt in gd films on fe in presence of magnetic fields was elaborately explained by camley exploiting mean field theory and atomistic model  @xcite .",
    "the phase transition to a twisted spin state for anti - ferromagnetically coupled gd and fe sublattices at higher field has also been shown by the same researcher  @xcite .",
    "the generic sources of pma in amorphous rare earth - transition metal ( re - tm ) alloy systems has been pointed out in the light of fundamental electro - magnetic theory  @xcite .",
    "the experimental studies confirm that the sources are material specific and vary with deposition process parameters  @xcite . from the point of view of application in magneto - optical recording with different re - tm alloys ,",
    "an excellent review has been provided by mieklejohn  @xcite , followed by hansen _",
    "on magneto - optical properties of gd , tb , fe , co based binary re - tm alloys  @xcite .    the purview to the domain imaging in gd - fe alloy or in gd / fe multilayer system started to a great extent in the beginning of 21st century .",

    "has been carried out by mangin et al .",
    "@xcite . in the most recent scenario ,",
    "the re - tm alloy thin films have gained interest in the field of studies of ultrafast magnetization dynamics due to the different temporal response of the respective sub - lattices  @xcite .",

    "100 nm thick gd - fe films were deposited by electron beam evaporation at room temperature on si  @xmath4 substrates under background pressure of @xmath5 torr .",
    "the deposition rate was optimized to be @xmath6 employing an alloy target with composition @xmath7 .",
    "the substrate has been rotated with a constant speed of 10 rpm to ensure uniformity in deposition .",
    "a 3  nm thick capping layer of cr was used to protect the films from oxidation .",
    "the thickness values mentioned here are recorded from the quartz crystal monitor associated to deposition unit .",
    "rtp experiments have been performed at @xmath0 under high vacuum for different annealing times _ viz .",
    "_ , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 minutes ( min ) with a rtp furnace , where the ramp rate of heating was optimized at @xmath8 .",
    "the structural information was obtained by grazing incidence x - ray diffraction ( gi - xrd ) using cu @xmath9 radiation at an angle of incidence @xmath10 .",
    "the microstructure of the films has been characterized by cross - sectional transmission electron microscope ( xtem ) , high - angle annular dark - field scanning transmission electron microscopy ( haadf - stem ) , energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) , using fei , tecnai g2 f30 , s - twin microscope operating at 300  kv .",
    "field emission scanning electron microscope ( fesem ) equipped with eds was used to study the surface morphology along with the overall composition .",
    "the composition was further checked by rutherford backscattered spectroscopy ( rbs ) technique using carbon ( @xmath11 ) beam of energy 6991  kev , derived from 3  mv tandetron accelerator ( hvee , europa ) .",
    "the scattering angle was set at @xmath12 and passive implanted planar silicon ( pips ) detector was utilized to carry out the experiment in a vacuum level of @xmath13 torr inside the sample chamber .",
    "the room temperature magnetization measurements have been carried out with vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) were performed simultaneously by using cocr coated antimony doped si tip at room temperature without any external magnetic field .",
    "the e - beam evaporated 100  nm thick gd - fe film shows a smooth surface with no identifiable features as in fig .  [ fig.1](a ) .",
    "the overall composition ( atomic % ) of the film has been found to be @xmath14 employing eds , associated with fesem .",
    "this has been checked at different places of the films and seen to be similar which ensures the homogeneity in composition for the films .",
    "the amorphous nature of the as - prepared film has been confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction ( saed ) pattern , taken along the cross - section , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](b ) .",
    "the film - substrate interface is very sharp , devoid of any diffusion or intermixing .",
    "the eds line profile has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](d ) , obtained across line 1 in the cross - sectional stem - haadf image ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) ) and the elemental composition is estimated to be @xmath15 .",
    "the eds spectrum from area 2 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](c ) ) has also been depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](e ) .",
    "no other source of contamination has been evidenced from the eds spectrum , except the presence of oxygen . for the as - prepared sample ,",
    "the presence of oxygen has been observed with increasing time , but the magnetic property does not change considerably .",
    "[ fig.2](a ) and ( b ) exhibits respectively the afm and mfm images of the as - prepared sample , which shows that the magnetic phase is free from topographic influences .",
    "mfm reveals elongated , periodic stripe domain pattern with high magnetic phase contrast .",
    "the domains are essentially the self organization of magnetization into alternating up - down magnetized bands .",
    "they are formed due to the competition between the exchange and anisotropy energies which favor a single domain state with magnetization perpendicular to the film plane , with long ranged demagnetizing field that favors the creation of in - plane ( ip ) domain walls by breaking the system into multi - domain state .",
    "the domain periodicity has been calculated from the 2d isotropic power spectral density ( psd ) profile as in fig .",
    "[ fig.2](c ) , estimated from the fourier transform of the mfm image .",
    "this allows us to obtain the periodic distribution of the mfm image ( twice the domain size ) and their relative weight  @xcite .",
    "the peak of the psd curve points out the wavelength of the most predominant feature in the image  @xcite .",
    "the psd is fitted with a lorentzian to point out the mean value and standard deviation which account for the domain periodicity and the associated error bar respectively .",
    "the domain size turned out to be around 122 ( @xmath16 )  nm by inverting the frequency of the 1st order peak .",
    "the presence of the other lower order peak designates the long range domain ordering .",
    "similar kind of domains in as - prepared gd - fe films has also been reported  @xcite .",
    "but , the magnetic properties are very sensitive to the processing conditions  @xcite such as temperature , pressure , deposition time and internal stress as well .",
    "we have reported the domain evolution as a function of film thickness for identical system  @xcite .",
    "this kind of sub-200  nm sized domains are usually the signature of the development of pma in thin films and results in a slanted hysteresis loop with almost zero remanence when measured along the out - of - plane ( oop ) direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2](d ) . similar feature of domains and hysteresis loop has also been reported for co / pt multilayer  @xcite and also in gd - fe thin films  @xcite . while the coercivity for the ip ( 51 gauss ) and oop ( 43 gauss ) loops are comparable , the remanence is more for the ip loop as observed from fig .",
    "[ fig.1](d ) .        as our interest involves anisotropy tuning in gd - fe thin films , so we have performed rtp at @xmath0 for different time intervals which results a global change in material properties , unlike local modifications by laser  @xcite or focused ion beam irradiation  @xcite .",
    "while the as - prepared film shows amorphous nature , rtp induces crystallinity in the films , degree of which increases upon increasing processing time , as observed from fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "the appearance of the peak at @xmath17 corresponds to the highest intensity peak of fe from ( 110 ) plane ( jcpds card number : 00 - 006 - 0696 ) .",
    "this designates the nucleation of crystalline fe over the amorphous gd - fe matrix .",
    "further , this has been verified by xtem images , performed on the samples after rtp of 20  min ( fig .  [ fig.4](a ) ) . a clear indication about the presence of fe can be observed from the eds line profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4](f ) ) of the cross - sectional stem - haadf image in fig .",
    "[ fig.4](e ) , mostly near the top and bottom surfaces .",
    "the composition is estimated to be @xmath18 along the depth .",
    "the top surface is rough due to the nm - sized crystalline growth of iron , which is evident from the selected area electron diffraction ( saed ) pattern ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.4](a ) ) .",
    "the d - spacings calculated from the diameter of the rings match with the reflections of bcc fe phase and the presence of spots confirms that the fe nanocrystals are distributed over the amorphous phase of gd - fe .",
    "further , one of the crystalline fe particle at the top surface has been shown in the hrtem image of fig .",
    "[ fig.4](b ) . the lattice spacing estimated to be 2.03   from the ifft image of the selected area as in fig .",
    "[ fig.4](b ) .",
    "this matches with [ 110 ] inter planar spacing of bcc fe with lattice constant of 2.867 .",
    "as rtp is a non - equilibrium process with very high ramp rate of heating , so the crystallization of fe is expected to be favorable due to its smaller atomic radius compared to gd .",
    "besides , the xtem image in fig .",
    "[ fig.4](a ) also confirms the presence of fe nanocrystal at the reacted film - substrate interface .",
    "similar observation of the crystallization of feco alloy over amorphous tbfeco matrix has been reported in  @xcite .",
    "on top of that , elemental mapping ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4](i))has been performed using stem - haadf - eds technique along the area shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4](h ) .",
    "this essentially verifies the presence of fe and gd over the considered area .     with different time interval ( mentioned in respective places).,width=336,height=302 ]        while the as - prepared film shows a feature - less smooth surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1](a ) ) , the presence of island - like granular microstructure has been evidenced in the surface fesem micrographs over a large field of view , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] .",
    "it can be qualitatively observed that the distribution of the grains in the surface is irregular and the grain size increases with the increase in rtp time . at 20",
    "min rtp time , the size becomes maximum with highest irregularity in the distribution .",
    "the measurement of the overall composition by eds , performed for the rtp samples showed a very little increment of the rare - earth metal upon increasing the rtp time and this is listed in table  [ table_1 ] .",
    "further study of composition has been carried out with rbs technique which provides higher resolution compared to eds .",
    "the experimental and the simulated rbs data along with the simulation model has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] .",
    "the overall composition for the as - prepared film has been estimated to be @xmath19 , from the area under the experimental curve in fig .",
    "[ fig.6](a ) .",
    "this turned out to be very similar with the eds data . for depth",
    "profiling of the elemental composition , the experimental data has been simulated with various model having different layer compositions .",
    "the best fitted model for the as - prepared film has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.6](c ) , which shows inhomogeneous distribution of gd and fe throughout the depth of the film by considering five intermediate layers .",
    "now the complexity arises after performing rtp for 10 min and the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.6](b ) .",
    "the composition calculated from the area under the curve is again comparable to the eds data , mentioned in table  [ table_1 ] .",
    "but the best - fit model shows us the real picture of the rtp effect by considering ten intermediate layers .",
    "it seems that the cr capping layer has been oxidized and presence of fe can be evidenced in the top and bottom layers , whereas for the middle layers , the presence of gd - fe alloy is observed .",
    "apart from that , the diffusion of si into the film may lead to the formation of alloy of fe and si at the film - substrate interface , which is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig.6](d ) .",
    "the results of rbs experiments also match with the findings of xtem , where we get an extra information on the crystalline state of fe at the top and bottom surfaces .        to probe the topography microscopically with higher resolution , afm measurement has been carried out for all the samples , which is shown in the series of fig .  [",
    "fig.7](a ) .",
    "similar findings of increasing nanocrystalline grain growth has also been noticed with increasing rtp time . to get quantitative information from the afm images , roughness , grain diameter and most probable threshold height of the topographic feature",
    "have been estimated and mentioned in table  [ table_1 ] .",
    "it has been observed that the surface roughness increases monotonically with rtp time and reaches almost 4.25 times when the rtp is performed for 20  min compared to that for 5  min . due to the increasing rtp time , the crystalline grain diameter increases , but the size distribution gets broader ( as the error is very high ) for 20  min sample .",
    "this can be attributed to the increase in non - uniformity in the distribution of the crystallites over the film surface which has also been qualitatively understood from the fesem images ( fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] ) . from the point of view of scanning probe microscopy",
    ", threshold height is an important criterion which designates the average height of the topographic feature with respect to the maximum height in the depth histogram analysis .",
    "the most probable threshold height turns out to be maximum for the sample with processing time of 15  min and again drops down at 20  min .",
    "but comparatively higher value of the full width half maxima ( fwhm ) essentially proves again the non - uniform growth of the crystallites for the films with rtp time of 20  min .",
    ".variation of overall elemental composition , roughness , grain size and threshold height of grains with rtp time interval .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table_2 ]    in the light of the magnetic microstructure and magnetization measurements , it is evident that the magnetic anisotropy is getting modified due to rtp .",
    "but the experimental limitation hindered us to image the domain structure without topographic influence .",
    "this has been complemented by 3d micromagnetic simulation , which directly shows the variation of magnetic domains as a function of anisotropy value as well as its ip tilt along the @xmath1 plane .",
    "the simulations of magnetic domains are carried out by oommf software  @xcite which performs the minimization of the total magnetic energy of the system , starting from a random state with uniform vertical ( @xmath20 ) magnetization .",
    "the input parameters used for the simulations have been taken from  @xcite which include saturation magnetization ( @xmath21 ) = @xmath22 , uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constant ( @xmath23 ) = @xmath24 and the exchange stiffness constant ( @xmath25 ) = @xmath26 .",

    "[ fig.9](a ) shows the domain structure ( @xmath30 component of the magnetization vector ) for a 100  nm thick gd - fe films , specified by the mentioned input parameters .",
    "the two different contrasts ( red and blue ) in the image represent oppositely magnetized alternating up - down domains having magnetization parallel or anti - parallel to the surface normal .",
    "the total area of simulation ( @xmath31 ) is much greater than the characteristic feature of the domains , so the effect of truncation can be neglected .",
    "the domain in the first image of fig .",
    "[ fig.9](a ) shows a perfect demagnetized state with connected stripes and that can be considered to be comparable to the domain pattern of the as - prepared sample as in fig .",
    "[ fig.2](b ) .",
    "line scans over the different areas of the domains show the average domain size to be 107 ( @xmath32 5 ) nm , which is comparable to the domain size obtained from the experiment . on top of that ,",
    "the domain wall ( @xmath33 component ) width turned out to be 26 ( @xmath32 2 ) nm which matches very close to the theoretical value of 28  nm ( @xmath34 ) . in order to study the effect of anisotropy in oop to ip transition of the magnetization",
    ", we have systematically decreased the anisotropy value at an interval of 10% of the original value , mentioned above .",
    "the variation of domain size and domain wall width as a function of anisotropy value has been depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.10](a ) .",
    "the simulated domain size decreases with decreasing the anisotropy value and simultaneously the domain wall width increases .",
    "finally , at @xmath35 ( 50% less compared to the original ) , ip components come into the picture and as a result of that the elongated stripe pattern tries to shrink to a closed circular - like domains to minimize the magnetostatic energy .",
    "the comparable values of domain size and domain wall width at the same anisotropy value ( fig .",
    "[ fig.10](a ) ) also signifies a strong competition between the ip and oop components of the magnetization .",
    "similar observations on domain pattern were also reported for co / pt multilayer in response to ultrafast laser pulse and was also verified by micromagnetic simulations  @xcite . the series of images in fig .",
    "[ fig.9](b ) shows the effect of anisotropy tilt along the @xmath1 plane . the first image in fig .",
    "[ fig.9](b ) series shows the domain configuration at @xmath36 tilt angle with respect to the original one , as in the first image of fig .",
    "[ fig.9](a ) . with increasing tilt angle ,",
    "the domain structure is getting modified and the random stripe domain pattern is converted to irregular discrete bubbles and patches , trying to orient along the longitudinal direction .",
    "this effect is very clear from the domain image with a tilt angle of @xmath37 onwards .",
    "moreover , the contrast variation in the normalized images confirms that the pma decreases and the resulting anisotropy does not energetically favor the formation of elongated periodic stripe pattern which has also been evidenced from the experimental results .",
    "while the irregular domain pattern with different color contrast hinders to estimate the domain size properly , the energetics of the system ( fig .  [ fig.10](b ) ) clearly throw light towards the micromagnetic phenomena .",
    "the monotonic decrease in total energy of the system is followed by the decrease in other magnetic energies , namely uniaxial anisotropy energy ( @xmath38 ) , exchange energy ( @xmath39 ) and demagnetization energy ( @xmath40 ) with increasing tilt angle .",
    "but the maximum variation of @xmath38 is calculated to be 75% whereas the other two energies show a negligible variation up to the tilt angle of @xmath2 .",
    "this may be considered as the threshold value of the tilt angle in this material system to offer a spin re - orientation after which ip component of magnetization becomes stronger . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 drops down to 84% and 62% respectively .",
    "thus , our simulation results correlate the effect of magnetization tilt in magnetic microstructure as well as the energetics of the system .",
    "detailed study on structure , microstructure and magnetic properties have been performed on gd - fe thin films , subjected to rtp at different time interval .",
    "100  nm thick amorphous as - deposited film shows elongated stripe domains with higher magnetic phase contrast which symbolizes the development of pma in the material . rtp treatment at @xmath0 for different time intervals induce the nucleation of fe nanocrystals over amorphous gd - fe matrix .",
    "the detailed structural study by xtem reveals the presence of nanocrystalline iron in the top and bottom surfaces , quantification of which has been provided by rbs .",
    "fesem surface micrographs and afm show the irregular distribution of island - like grains on the surface , characteristic size of which increases with increasing annealing time .",
    "the magnetization studies explain that the films behave to be magnetized in the plane of the surface upon different time interval of rtp , which can be corroborated to the crystallization of fe , that gives an ip tilt to the magnetic moment .",
    "special thrust has been given to understand the magnetic microstructure with the increase in annealing time .",
    "the decrease in magnetic contrast and simultaneous growth of topographic feature limit us to get a topography free magnetic contrast by mfm . to unravel the modification of domain structure ,",
    "3d micromagnetic simulations have been carried out which successfully explains the change in the domain pattern , their size , orientation and micromagnetic energetics of the system under the modification of anisotropy value and its direction .",
