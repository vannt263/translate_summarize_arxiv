    "tomographic information about the evolution of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in a high - energy nuclear collision is commonly extracted by jet - quenching observables which , however , depend on the details of both the jet - medium dynamics , @xmath1 , as well as the bulk temperature and flow velocity fields .",
    "recently , phenix @xcite compared their measured data on the nuclear modification factor in- and out - of - plane to different perturbative qcd ( pqcd)-based and one ads - cft motivated jet - energy loss model , considering a longitudinal and transverse expanding hydrodynamic background .",
    "their result strongly suggest that only the ads - inspired model explains _ both _ the nuclear modification factor and the high-@xmath2 elliptic flow accessible through @xmath3 .",
    "while the yield of nuclear modification factor could as well be described by the pqcd - based amy , ht , and asw models considered , their high-@xmath2 elliptic flow is significantly too low .",
    "this is in line with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , showing that the pqcd ( d)glv energy loss prescription coupled to either the 3d mpc parton transport model @xcite or the ( 2 + 1)d transverse expansion of vish2 + 1 @xcite applying a temperature - independent running coupling lead to a high-@xmath2 elliptic flow that is by a factor of @xmath4 smaller than the measured data , while the @xmath5 can well be reproduced .",
    "the aim of the present work is to braden the phenix analysis by considering a wider class of @xmath6 models coupled to different flow fields and by extending the analysis to a simultaneous description of rhic and lhc .",
    "we study models based on pqcd , conformal and non - conformal ads holography , as well as a phenomenological prescription with an enhanced jet - energy loss around the transition temperature of @xmath7  mev ( referred to as sltc @xcite ) .",
    "each model is coupled to different bulk qgp collective fields as given by ( 1 ) vish2 + 1 @xcite , ( 2 ) the rl ( romatschke - luzum ) hydro @xcite , and ( 3 ) a simple @xmath8 transverse blast wave model @xcite .    the generic energy - loss model considered @xcite",

    "@xmath16 describes quark ( gluon ) jets .    in the following ,",
    "we particularly distinguish four different cases : ( 1 ) a running coupling qcd energy loss qcdrad @xmath17 , ( 2 ) an elastic jet - energy loss @xcite qcdel @xmath18 , ( 3 ) a scenario characterized by a conformal falling string @xcite ads @xmath19 , and ( 4 ) a @xmath20-dominated energy loss @xcite with @xmath21 sltc @xmath17 . for each scenario ,",

    "the most striking result in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "is that in contrast to the phenix results @xcite _ all _ scenarios based on a ( viscous ) hydrodynamic background describe the measured @xmath24  gev data within the present error bars . only the @xmath23 transverse blast wave background leads to an in / out asymmetry with a factor of two below recent phenix data .",
    "the qualitative difference to the phenix results , in particular to the different slope of the @xmath25 , is due to various details of the hydrodynamic simulation and the jet - energy loss precription . in the study shown by phenix",
    ", the flow field was computed with an ideal ( non - dissipative ) hydrodynamic code assuming a bag model first - order phase transition while the vish2 + 1 code considered here is based on a smoothed ( sm - eos q ) equation of state ( eos ) and the viscous rl hydro employs a more realistic continuous crossover transition .    given this difficulty of untangling the background and jet - energy loss effects at one particular @xmath26 , we continue by exploring the dependence of the jet asymmetry on the collision energy and study lhc conditions , see fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] , for the four jet - energy loss scenarios and the three background fields introduced above .",
    "however , in contrast to rhic data , at lhc energies the nuclear modification factors and the high-@xmath2 elliptic flow are only issued separately ( i.e.  not as @xmath25 ) .",
    "therefore , we have to split up the lhc results into two subplots for each scenario ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .    for the pqcd - based scenarios qcdrad and qcdel , we assume a running coupling effect @xcite .",
    "i.e.  the jet - medium coupling @xmath27 is reduced by @xmath28 as compared to @xmath29 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a1 ) and ( a2 ) , qcdrad reproduces both the nuclear modification factors and the high-@xmath2 elliptic flow within the uncertainties of the bulk space - time evolution given , amongst others , by the initial condition , the shear viscosity over entropy ratio ( @xmath30 ) , and the initial time @xmath13 .",
    "this running coupling qcd energy loss , however , appears to be preferred over the elastic jet - energy loss qcdel [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b1 ) and ( b2 ) ] .",
    "in contrast to those pqcd cases discussed in fig .  [ fig2](a ) and ( b ) , we do _ not _ consider a qcd running coupling effect for the ads - inspired energy loss and the sltc model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and ( d ) but assume that @xmath31 . in the ads case ,",
    "the reason is that _ conformal _ ads / cft implies scale invariance and thus does not allow for a running but only a fixed coupling . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2](c1 ) , this fixing of the jet - medium coupling at rhic energies leads to the well - known overquenching of the nuclear modification factor @xcite and thus to an enhancement of the high-@xmath2 elliptic flow as compared to the pqcd scnearios .",

    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig2](d1 ) and ( d2 ) proofs that for a more realistic ( 2 + 1)d expanding medium the temperature dependence of the jet - medium coupling around a critical temperature of @xmath33  mev is not sufficient to describe the nuclear modification factor at lhc energies .    while we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c1 ) and ( c2 ) that _ conformal _ ads / cft is ruled out by the data , a recent non - standard ads / cft formulation of  shooting \" strings @xcite leads to an analytic jet - energy loss formula that interpolates between the above discussed extremes of qcdel and ads ( because the path - length dependence within this prescription is itself temperature dependent ) .",
