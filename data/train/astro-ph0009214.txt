    "nearly forty years after their discovery , it is still not clear what determines the degree of radio emission from quasars .",
    "although quasars were first discovered at radio wavelengths @xcite , it has long been known that most quasars emit a very small fraction of their total power in the radio @xcite . when radio observations had limited sensitivity , it made sense to talk about two populations : radio - loud and radio - quiet .",
    "however , @xcite detected about 90% of objects in the mostly low redshift palomar - green bright quasar survey ( bqs ) .",
    "this survey revealed that ( a ) the radio luminosity range of the bqs is almost disjoint with that of radio - selected quasars , ( b ) the ratio of radio to optical power is continuous and spans at least five orders of magnitude , and ( c ) while most quasars are radio - quiet , few if any are truly radio - silent .    in the absence of a physical understanding of the radio emission in most quasars ,",
    "it is not clear how best to define radio - loudness .",
    "many workers have used the ratio of radio - to - optical power , @xmath4 , to characterize the degree of radio emission @xcite .",
    "this has an advantage as a distant - independent quantity , but its interpretation is only physically meaningful if radio and optical luminosity are correlated .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that this is unlikely to be the case .",
    "another common definition of radio - loud is based on a radio luminosity boundary , @xmath5 w hz@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "radio luminosity can be interpreted in terms of a physical model .",
    "the choice of log @xmath6 for radio - loud is convenient since it corresponds to a typical @xmath7 mjy detection limit for a quasar with @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "radio - loudness is an arbitrary concept in the sense that no one has convincingly demonstrated that the distributions of either radio luminosity or radio - to - optical power are bimodal .",
    "demographic studies of the radio emission from quasars are affected by the fact that the upper bounds in a detection experiment are correlated with redshift .",
    "different samples must therefore be combined to break the degeneracy between luminosity and redshift .",
    "the only way to study low luminosity quasars at high redshift is to combine a faint optical survey with extremely sensitive radio observations .",
    "we have chosen to do this in the direction of the northern hubble deep field ( hdf ) , a small region of sky which is at the locus of a wide range of extragalactic studies @xcite . in",
    " 2 of this paper , we use a recently published deep radio survey to measure the radio luminosities of quasars found in a one square degree region centered on the hdf . in  3 , we combine this sample with other quasar surveys to study the radio - loud fraction as a function of redshift and luminosity .",
    "we present conclusions in  4 .",
    "modelling of quasar evolution and speculation as to the nature of the radio emission mechanism is deferred to a future paper .",
    "we use @xmath10 kms@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) throughout for the calculation of luminosity .",
    "the northern hubble deep field , along with its southern twin , has motivated a broad array of projects designed to measure the luminous content of the universe out to high redshift .",
    "we have been carrying out multi - color surveys of optically faint quasars in one square degree regions centered on each of the deep fields .",
    "the quasars will be used to thread these volumes with absorption sightlines , and to compare the location of the absorbers with the large scale structures measured by pencil beam redshift surveys of galaxies @xcite .",
    "our first paper reported 30 quasars in the magnitude range @xmath13 and the redshift range @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "an independent group is working on quasar selection in a smaller region centered on the hdf @xcite , and they find an additional 4 quasars with @xmath15 .    to complement the optical imaging with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ,",
    "@xcite have carried out a deep radio survey of the hdf down to a 5@xmath16 limit of 9 @xmath17jy at 8.5 ghz .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a catalog of 372 radio sources ( 1.4 ghz ) within 20 arcmin of the hdf , with a 3@xmath16 sensitivity limit ranging from @xmath18jy at the center of the field to 230  @xmath17jy at a radius of 20 arcmin .",
    "the strongest sources in the sky are radio galaxies and quasars in roughly equal numbers . at flux levels",
    "a million times lower , the radio source population is likely to be composed primarily of star - forming disk galaxies , with a relatively small component of quasars and other agn @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such a sensitive radio survey for our purposes is the fact that quasars at redshifts of @xmath19 can be detected down to the traditional boundary between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of hdf radio sources from @xcite , plotted as open circles , along with the distribution of spectroscopically confirmed quasars , plotted as stars .",
    "there are 34 quasars within a one square degree area centered on the hdf , 30 of which come from @xcite and 4 of which are added from @xcite .",
    "since both studies used a uvx selection technique and found almost all their quasars in the magnitude interval @xmath20 , it is appropriate to combine them .    in a detection experiment such as this , we must bear in mind the fact that the hdf is not a truly random patch of sky in terms of numbers of strong radio sources @xcite . to allow very deep radio observations ,",
    "the field was chosen such that there was no source stronger than 1 mjy in the primary beam of the vla at 8.5 ghz .",
    "the full sample of @xcite has 29 sources within 4.6 arcmin of the hdf center .",
    "however , our experiment is carried out over the substantially larger field of the 1.4 ghz observations @xcite . for the observed median spectral index of 0.63 @xcite , 1  mjy at 8.5",
    "ghz corresponds to 3.1 mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "there are 9 sources stronger than 3.1 mjy over the 1.4 ghz field of view , or a surface density of 0.0072 sources per square arcminute .",
    "the expected number of sources in the smaller region of the 8.5 ghz data is therefore only 0.48 .",
    "thus the pre - ordained absence of a source in the central region is not a large perturbation on the statistics of our experiment .",
    "in addition , the central region is only 5.3% of the total area of our identification experiment .",
    "a potentially more serious issue is incompleteness in the quasar surveys .",
    "the radio survey is uniform down to a particular flux limit , but multicolor quasar selection is not perfectly efficient , and not all candidates brighter than @xmath21 have had confirming spectroscopy .",
    "this means that the region could contain radio sources identified with unrecognized quasars , which would bias the identification process to lower radio - to - optical flux ratios . in practice , we believe this is not an important effect . the uvx technique is known to be efficient out to @xmath22 , which encompasses the quasars used in this study @xcite .",
    "the observed surface density of 34 deg@xmath23 is in excellent agreement with the highest surface densities ever measured down to this magnitude level @xcite .",
    "there are 12 quasars in the region sampled by the deep vla observations , as outlined by the circle in figure 1 .",
    "these quasars can be identified by positional coincidence with the radio sources .",
    "the rms astrometric errors on the radio and optical positions are 0.03@xmath24 and 0.5@xmath24 , respectively @xcite . with accurate positions and a low surface density of quasars and radio sources",
    ", there is a small probability of a chance coincidence within three times the rms positional error .",
    "however , figure 1 shows that the hdf sources are centrally concentrated , due to attenuation by the primary beam pattern .",
    "a statistical test confirms that the radial distribution of radio sources departs from the expectation for a random distribution at more than the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "by contrast , the quasar distribution within one square degree is consistent with a random distribution .",
    "this means that the probability of a chance coincidence is higher towards the center of the hdf , and it indicates that we should carry out a more rigorous procedure before declaring a radio counterpart .",
    "the results of the identification procedure are summarized in table 1 . for each of",
    "the 12 confirmed quasars within the circular region measured by the vla , we select the nearest radio source as a potential counterpart .",
    "the first five columns of table 1 give the name , j2000 position , @xmath25 magnitude and redshift of the 12 quasars .",
    "the simulation procedure takes into account the different surface densities of quasars and radio sources and the fact that the radio source distribution shows a radial gradient .",
    "we randomly reposition the 34 quasars within the one square degree and repeat this 1500 times . the radial distance to the field center , @xmath26 , and the angular distance to the nearest neighbor radio source , @xmath27 , are saved for each of these 51,000 random quasar placements .",
    "then , for each of the 12 quasars , we form the distribution of @xmath27 for random quasars falling in an annulus 100 arcseconds wide centered on the radial distance of each quasar from the center of the hdf .",
    "the nearest neighbor distributions for this random experiment are shown in figure 2 .",
    "each panel in the figure is labelled with four items .",
    "the first is the quasar name .",
    "the second is the radial distance of that quasar from the center of the hdf .",
    "the histograms show how the mean nearest neighbor distance depends on @xmath26  the surface density of radio sources is highest near the hdf , so the nearest neighbor distances will on average be smallest .",
    "the overall number of trials was chosen so that there were at least 1000 measurements in each histogram .",
    "the third item labelled is the actual offset of that quasar from the nearest radio source , @xmath27 ( column 8 in table 1 ) , marked by a vertical dotted line in the figure .",
    "the fourth item is the fraction of trials in the random placement experiment where the quasar had an angular distance of @xmath27 or smaller from the nearest radio source .",
    "equivalently , it is the probability , @xmath28 , that the actual nearest neighbor is a chance counterpart .",
    "this number can easily be converted into a percentage confidence limit on the identification , ( @xmath29)/100 .",
    "three out of 12 of the quasars have weak radio sources within 1.5 arcseconds , or within three times the sum of the radio and optical position errors added in quadrature .",
    "these quasars are therefore identified with greater than 99.5% confidence .",
    "it is clear that the identification procedure is robust , since none of the other nine quasars have radio sources within 15 arcseconds .",
    "the probability @xmath28 is strongly bimodal ; three quasars have @xmath30 ( taking into account the statistical accuracy due to the number of points generated for each monte carlo histogram ) , and the other nine have @xmath31 . to ensure uniqueness , we inspected the 2nd and 3rd nearest neighbors for the three quasars with close companions .",
    "the nearest neighbor is by far the most likely true counterpart with @xmath32 in all cases , except for the 2nd nearest neighbor to j123800 + 6213 which has @xmath33 .",
    "radio fluxes for the three new identifications are listed in the last column of table 1 .",
    "the other nine quasars are assigned a 3@xmath16 upper bound based on the quoted formal completeness limit of @xmath18jy with a scaling by the instrumental gain as presented in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found no quasar or agn identifications with sources from their 8.5 ghz survey .",
    "we can use our results to put an approximate upper bound on the quasar component of the 1.4 ghz survey .",
    "only 3 out of 372 , or about 1% , faint radio sources are identified with quasars .",
    "we can scale this number up by a factor of 6 to account for 50% incompleteness due to color selection , and at most a factor of 3 increase in optical quasar counts down to @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "thus , we predict no more than @xmath35 of ultrafaint radio sources can be quasars of _ any _ optical brightness .",
    "this conclusion is firm because the optical survey is deep enough to have seen all the way through the quasar luminosity function for all reasonable cosmologies , and our existing identifications and limits are near the lower bound of the distribution of radio - to - optical flux ratios .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we prefer to characterize quasars by their radio luminosity rather than their radio - to - optical luminosity ratio , since emissions in the two wavelength regimes appear to not be closely related .",
    "early workers suspected that there were distinct radio - loud and radio - quiet categories of quasars @xcite . however , the onset of the radio - quiet population happens to correspond to the typical flux limit of a vla snapshot , so the evidence for bimodality was never compelling .",
    "as sample sizes have increased , the evidence for two populations has weakened @xcite .",
    "@xcite established the procedure that has become standard for most papers in this field , defining a monochromatic radio luminosity in the rest frame and assuming that the radio emission is isotropic , with units of w hz@xmath1 .",
    "radio luminosity is a continuous variable in the quasar population , but @xmath5 w hz@xmath1 is a useful definition of radio - loudness , because it corresponds to the beginning of the tail of the distribution .",
    "it is also roughly equivalent to the definition of @xcite , @xmath36 w hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 .    in this section , we combine the hdf quasar sample with other samples to explore the dependence of the radio - loud fraction on redshift and luminosity .",
    "the calculation of all distance - dependent quantities assumes @xmath10 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and @xmath11 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "rest frame radio luminosities are calculated for an observed flux at 5 ghz .",
    "this matches the frequency of bqs data ; radio k - corrections for other samples assume a radio spectral index @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "rest frame absolute magnitudes for the bqs are adopted from @xcite .",
    "the calculation of rest frame absolute magnitude for all other samples uses the k - corrections calculated by @xcite using a composite lbqs spectrum .",
    "the typical uncertainty in these derived quantities for a particular quasar are @xmath40 mag for @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath42 for log @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the large uncertainty in optical luminosity is due to source variability and the large dispersion in rest frame uv to optical spectral indices .",
    "we note that these uncertainties are small compared with the overall range of radio ( @xmath44 ) and optical ( @xmath45 ) luminosity .",
    "figure 3 shows the coverage of the various samples in terms of linear look - back time and optical luminosity .",
    "equivalent values of redshift are also plotted .",
    "the diamonds show the 114 quasars of the optically bright bqs @xcite .",
    "the open circles show the 367 quasars with radio measurements from the lbqs @xcite .",
    "we choose not to augment this with additional matches in large area surveys like first @xcite and nvss @xcite , because those surveys have 2 - 6 times lower sensitivity limits .",
    "the stars show 87 quasars from the edinburgh survey @xcite , which covers a similar region of the redshift - luminosity plane to the lbqs .",
    "the twelve new hdf quasars are shown as filled circles in figure 3 .",
    "the dotted lines show the plane divided up into equal sized regions of look - back time and absolute magnitude .",
    "the highest redshift slice encompasses the epoch of maximum quasar space density .",
    "the lower redshift slices span the time over which the space density has declined by two orders of magnitude to the present epoch .",
    "the radio - loud fractions in these intervals of look - back time and optical luminosity are investigated in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the intercomparison of samples with bright and faint optical limits allows us to break the degeneracy between redshift and luminosity which exists for any single , flux - limited sample . with a bright magnitude limit and wide area sky coverage ,",
    "the bqs includes some of the most optically luminous quasars known .",
    "however , evidence that the bqs is incomplete @xcite , along with the possibility that the incompleteness depends on radio properties @xcite , leads us to be cautious in drawing conclusions that depend only on the bqs .",
    "the lbqs is a homogeneous survey with a well understood selection function @xcite .",
    "compared to the bqs , the lbqs reaches lower optical luminosities at a given redshift and higher redshifts at a given optical luminosity . even though the hdf sample is small , figure 3 shows that it covers an important range of parameter space at low optical luminosity and moderate redshift .",
    "figure 4 shows absolute magnitude plotted against radio luminosity for the three samples that cover approximately the same redshift range : the hdf , lbqs and edinburgh samples .",
    "symbols are the same as in figure 3 .",
    "upper limits are plotted as arrows for the hdf quasars ; a box outlines the region containing the upper limits for lbqs and edinburgh quasars .",
    "two conclusions can be drawn from this plot .",
    "first , the hdf quasars are extremely weak radio emitters .",
    "all twelve are below the traditional threshold for a radio - loud quasar , @xmath46 w hz@xmath1 . in fact ,",
    "all but one of the twelve are a factor of ten weaker than this limit , and 2 out of 12 are about a factor of 100 weaker than this limit .",
    "it is clear from figure 4 that the great sensitivity of the hdf radio survey pushes the parameter space of radio luminosity for moderate redshift quasars . also , there is no strong correlation between radio and optical luminosity for these samples .",
    "we have identified six regions in figure 3 for investigating the demographics of the radio - loud fraction . the sequence from 1 to 2 to 3 represents the cosmic evolution of the radio - loud fraction , in equal bins of one third of the look - back time , in the low luminosity range @xmath47 .",
    "the sequence from 1 to 4 to 6 represents the change in the radio - loud fraction with increasing optical luminosity by a factor of a thousand , in the redshift range @xmath48 .",
    "we include the bqs sample in this comparison , noting that these quasars only contribute to the bin at low redshift and low luminosity ( region 3 ) and the bin at high redshift and high luminosity ( region 6 ) .",
    "table 2 shows the statistics from these four samples combined , for three different definitions of the radio - loud fraction : log @xmath49 , log @xmath50 , and log @xmath51 w hz@xmath1 .",
    "all of the radio surveys have upper limits , but log @xmath49 is above the limits in any of the surveys we are using .",
    "the criterion log @xmath50 matches the most common definition in the literature , and it is immune from the nature of the radio non - detections for quasars less luminous than @xmath52 ( see dashed box that defines upper limits in figure 4 ) .",
    "we note that all but one of the hdf quasars are radio - quiet at the level of log @xmath53 , but the nature of the upper limits becomes important above a luminosity of @xmath54 .",
    "the footnotes in table 2 give the number of quasars for which the designation radio - loud or radio - quiet is uncertain because the detection upper limit lies above the selected boundary in @xmath43 .",
    "a lower limit on the radio - loud fraction can be estimated by assuming all of the uncertain quasars are radio - quiet  these values are also included in the footnotes to table 2 .",
    "the data in the table show no trend for evolution in the radio - loud fraction of low luminosity quasars with cosmic time .",
    "a low radio - loud fraction of 0.05 - 0.10 is seen at all epochs ( for @xmath55 ) . in agreement with @xcite",
    ", we see an increase in the radio - loud fraction with increasing optical luminosity . in the redshift interval @xmath56 , the radio - loud fraction rises by a factor of 3 - 4 over a span of a factor of a thousand in optical luminosity .",
    "the low luminosity hdf quasars provide the strongest tether on this result , because 1/9 are radio - loud at any of the three radio thresholds .",
    "we have identified quasars selected from a multi - color survey with radio sources from a very deep catalog of a region centered on the northern hubble deep field .",
    "the identification procedure accounts for the non - uniform radial distribution of radio sources over this region . although limited by small number statistics , the result of the comparison is new information on the radio properties of low luminosity quasars at moderate redshift .",
    "we reach the following conclusions :    \\(1 ) twelve optically selected quasars with @xmath57 and @xmath58 are in the region within 20 arcmin of the hdf , which was covered in the deep radio survey of richards ( 1999 ) .",
    "three of the quasars are identified with weak radio sources at greater than a 99.9% confidence level .",
    "the remaining nine are below a @xmath59 limit of 40 to 230 @xmath17jy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "\\(2 ) the hdf quasars are extremely weak radio - emitters .",
    "all but one of the twelve have radio luminosities more than an order of magnitude below the traditional boundary between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , @xmath60 w hz@xmath1 .",
    "two of the twelve are about two orders of magnitude below that boundary , and are the lowest radio luminosity quasars ever measured at these redshifts .",
    "\\(3 ) there is no strong evidence that radio and optical luminosity are correlated , a conclusion that is essentially independent of the nature of the radio non - detections .",
    "if we make a plausible assumption about the completeness of the optical quasar selection , no more than @xmath61% of the radio source population above @xmath62jy can be quasars at any optical brightness level .",
    "\\(4 ) the fraction of quasars more radio luminous than 10@xmath63 w hz@xmath1 is 3 - 5% ( or 5 - 10% above @xmath64 w hz@xmath1 ) , independent of redshift over the range @xmath48 .",
    "the fraction of quasars above @xmath65 w hz@xmath1 in radio luminosity shows slight evidence for an increase with increasing redshift . while the quasar space density evolves over two orders of magnitude , the probability of a quasar being a strong radio source is independent of epoch .",
    "\\(5 ) the radio - loud fraction of quasars shows a marginally significant increase by a factor of three , going from low to high optical luminosity .",
    "this modest effect , combined with the lack of any strong correlation between radio and optical luminosity , means that the quasar radio luminosity function can not be much flatter than the optical luminosity function .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with pippa goldschmidt , eric hooper , charles liu , and eric richards .",

    "<S> we combine this information with other radio surveys of quasars so as to break the degeneracy between redshift and luminosity . in the redshift range @xmath2 , the radio - loud fraction increases with increasing optical luminosity , consistent with some degree of correlation between the non - thermal optical and radio emissions . </S>",
