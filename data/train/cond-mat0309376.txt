    "one learns two things : firstly , @xmath22 does not depend on the choice of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . secondly ,",

    "a simple phenomenological explanation for this is the following : if the place of the measurement is far from the voltage drop the particles have to travel a long distance and hence one has to wait a long time , before one can determine @xmath22 .",
    "we can now place both the voltage drop and our current measurement at the middle of the system , but this should not help much .",
    "the problem is that the particles still have to travel a long distance until they see the leads .",
    "hence @xmath43 will be unaffected by the introduction of leads if @xmath44 is sufficiently large .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by the qmc - data presented in fig .",
    "[ leads ] . in this figure the exponential decay of @xmath43 at small @xmath44 is apparent , and the curves illustrate clearly that this decay is induced by the length scale @xmath106because it becomes stronger with increasing @xmath106 .",
    "it is this decay that prevents us from discussing larger @xmath106 .",
    "if we increase @xmath106 the decay becomes stronger , hence we need to evaluate @xmath43 for more ( and smaller ) frequencies in order to extract @xmath89 reliably .",
    "but smaller frequencies are only available at smaller temperatures .",
    "as we can not decrease @xmath0 much below @xmath108 we restrict ourselves to @xmath109 . if we considered a system with @xmath110 ( at @xmath111 ) we would not see any difference from a system without leads , because the difference occurs at small @xmath44 .    the data presented in fig .",
    "[ leads ] clearly indicates an upturn of @xmath43 for @xmath112 , indicating that @xmath89 is unaffected by the interaction in the low - temperature limit .",
    "our result may , however , not be totally convincing , since we can only analyze relatively small interacting regions .",
    "one might argue that the enhanced conductance is not due to the leads but simply to the reduced `` mean '' interaction  which is close to zero as only few sites interact . to invalidate this argument we considered another model .",
    "we have performed qmc - simulation of a system where we attach a lead only at _",
    "one _ side such that we obtain a chain which is non - interacting in one half and interacting in the other .",
    "for this system we found no deviation at all imaginary frequencies from the situation where the interacting region extends over the whole chain , even though there are as many interacting as interaction - free bonds .",
    "monte carlo simulations allow the inclusion of long - range hopping , and thus breaking the integrability of the pure @xmath1-hamiltonian , as long as the resulting system is not frustrated .",
