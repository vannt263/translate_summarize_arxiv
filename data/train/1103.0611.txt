    "among the mysteries of nature is the number of generations . we observe three generations , however there could be a fourth generation if the masses of the quarks and leptons are beyond our present experimental reach .",
    "data from the tevatron ( under some circumstances ) restricts the masses of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks in a fourth generation to be greater than about @xmath8 .",
    "for some recent studies see @xcite .",
    "a strong constraint on the masses of fourth generation quarks comes from precision electroweak physics .",
    "heavy fourth generation quarks contribute to the @xmath9 parameter and to the @xmath10 parameter .",
    "their large contribution to the @xmath9 parameter rules out a fourth generation with degenerate @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks .",
    "however they also contribute to the @xmath10 parameter and kribs _ et .",
    "_ showed that an acceptable combined fit to precision electroweak data can be achieved , for example , with a mass splitting of about @xmath11 between fourth generation quarks in the mass range @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "see also the earlier work in @xcite .",
    "large splitting may also be possible @xcite . for a more recent discussion of electroweak",
    "fits see @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a `` unitarity upper limit '' on fourth generation quark mass of about @xmath13 @xcite . this does not , however , necessarily forbid heavier quark masses .",
    "rather it indicates that higher order perturbative corrections become important at this mass @xcite .",
    "dynamical considerations rather than unitarity give an upper bound of about @xmath14 .",
    "this is similar to the upper bound on the higgs scalar mass @xcite .",
    "a heavy fourth generation can destabilize electroweak symmetry breaking ( see @xcite for a review ) . according to the recent work in @xcite ,",
    "if there is no new physics ( apart from the fourth generation ) below a @xmath15 , the higgs mass should be roughly equal to or larger than fourth generation quark mass in order to avoid the instability .",
    "of course there could be new particles beyond the fourth generation fermions below a @xmath15 that get a large part of their masses from electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "for example , scalars @xmath9 that have a term in the scalar potential @xmath16 get a contribution to the squares of their masses equal to @xmath17 @xmath18 and such interactions could help stabilize the higgs potential .",
    "it is easy to imagine simple physical mechanisms that suppress the mass mixing between the heavy fourth generation quarks and the three generations of standard model quarks . for example",
    ", the fourth generation quarks and leptons could have a different value for @xmath19 than the standard three generations .",
    "( here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are baryon number and lepton number . )",
    "if @xmath19 violation is small then the mixing between fourth generation quarks and the standard three generations is suppressed .",
    "for example , a fourth generation of quarks and leptons with both baryon and lepton number minus three times those of the ordinary three generations of quarks and leptons can cancel the baryon and lepton number anomalies allowing those symmetries to be gauged @xcite .",
    "heavy fourth generation quarks feel a strong attractive force from higgs exchange in both the @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels that gives rise to bound states @xcite .",
    "if the fourth generation quarks have a very small mixing with the ordinary quarks , they can be long enough lived that bound @xmath22 states decay through @xmath24 annihilation and not via @xmath1 decay to a lower generation quark and a @xmath25 boson . in this case",
    "the production of these bound states at the lhc may have important experimental consequences .",
    "furthermore the @xmath26 bound states may be long very lived .",
    "references @xcite discuss some other interesting possible physical consequences of a heavy fourth generation .    in this paper we focus on the physics of the @xmath27 states . here",
    "we explore the role of perturbative corrections suppressed by @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( here @xmath4 is the number of color and @xmath29 is strong coupling constant ) , as well as relativistic corrections on the the spectrum and wave functions of the @xmath22 bound states .",
    "we find that the perturbative and relativistic corrections have a significant impact on wave functions and spectrum of @xmath22 bound states .",
    "the @xmath22 bound states can be in a color singlet or color octet configuration . for the color octet states we find the lightest fourth generation quark masses for which a bound state exists . in any color singlet configuration",
    "there is always a bound state .",
    "therefore we discuss the impact of the higgs couplings to the heavy quarks on the shape of the wave functions for the bound states and the bound state binding energies . in the numerical analysis , we sometimes show results for values of @xmath30 that are below the experimental limit of @xmath8 or above @xmath31 where we expect perturbation theory to be of limited use .",
    "our excursion in to these regimes is for pedagogical reasons and does not mean we dismiss the constraints from experiment or the limitations imposed by perturbativity .",
    "since precision electroweak physics favors a small value for @xmath32 ( here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are masses of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively ) , we work in the limit where the heavy fourth generation quark masses are equal , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath35 .",
    "it is straightforward to add in the effects of the difference between the heavy fourth generation quark masses .",
    "( we discuss the impact of a fourth generation quark mass splitting at the end of this paper . )",
    "then the leading order hamiltonian for heavy quark bound states from higgs scalar exchange is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are momentum and relative coordinate in the center of mass frame , and @xmath39 is the higgs scalar mass . in momentum space",
    "the leading potential from tree - level higgs exchange is @xmath40 here we have expressed the heavy quark yukawa coupling , @xmath2 , in terms of the fermi constant @xmath41 and the heavy fourth generation quark mass . using the variational method based on a trial wave function @xmath42 @xcite and taking , for example , @xmath43",
