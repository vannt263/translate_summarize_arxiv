    "in the last decade and a half , a quite effective tool is emerging for solving the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse)@xcite directly in minkowski space , i.e. avoiding to look for solutions in the euclidean space by exploiting the wick rotation @xcite .",
    "the novel approach is based on the nakanishi integral representation ( nir ) of the @xmath0-leg transition amplitudes , that was proposed long time ago  @xcite . in particular , the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) amplitude can be formally written like the nir for the @xmath1-leg amplitude , namely a proper folding of an unknown nakanishi weight function and a denominator that contains the analytic structure @xcite . to be practical ,",
    "let us quickly mention the main features of the nir for the bs amplitude : ( i ) the weight function is real and smooth for bound states ( see @xcite for the zero - energy scattering states ) , and ( ii ) it depends upon real variables , of which one is non - compact and the others are compact ; ( iii ) the denominator must depend only upon the independent scalars that can be constructed from the external momenta .",
    "assuming the validity of the nir for the bound - state case , and taking advantage of the above mentioned features , one can exactly project onto the null - plane ( see , e.g. @xcite ) the bs amplitude integrating over the light - front ( lf ) variable @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and formally obtain the so - called lf _ valence wave function _",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. the amplitude of the component with the lowest number of constituents when the lf fock expansion of the interacting - system state is considered .",
    "remarkably , within the nir approach , the lf valence wave function is given by a non - singular integral involving the nakanishi weight function .",
    "this suggests to integrate on @xmath5 both sides of the bse , getting an integral equation for the nakanishi weight function .",
    "if there exist solutions for this integral equation ( this validates a posteriori the previous assumption ) , then the bs amplitudes of bound states can be reconstructed . in particular , when the above procedure is applied to the bse with the irreducible kernel in ladder approximation , a generalized eigen - equation for the nakanishi weight function",
    "is obtained ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for the lf case ) , while for the cross - ladder case one has to deal with a non - linear eigen - problem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . notice that in refs .",
    "@xcite solutions of the scalar bse in ladder approximation have been obtained by using ( i ) standard variables ( and not the lf ones ) , and ( ii ) exploiting the uniqueness of the nakanishi weight function .",
    "aim of the present work is to carefully study both spectrum and 3d structure of the bound states , obtained by solving the ladder bse for a system composed by two massive scalars interacting through a massive scalar .",
    "such an investigation is a natural extension of the previous analysis of only the ground state @xcite .",
    "in particular , the structure is studied by means of the 3d representation of the lf valence component , both in momentum and impact - parameter ( ip ) spaces .",
    "one of the motivations for starting a detailed analysis of the non - perturbative features of an interacting system in momentum and ip spaces ( see , e.g.@xcite for an introduction ) is given by the increasing interest on this topic in hadronic physics , where the valence component plays an important role in determining the dynamical properties of hadrons .",
    "for instance , the valence component is an important dynamical ingredient for evaluating parton transverse - momentum distributions , which depend upon both the bjorken momentum fraction @xmath6 and the transverse components of parton momentum  @xcite , or parton density distributions in ip space , that can be related to the generalized parton distributions ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "[ end ] , conclusions are drawn and some perspectives presented .",
    "let us recall the general formalism we have adopted to solve the bse in minkowski space . as it is well known the bse in momentum space for a relativistic bound state is given by the following homogeneous integral equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the interaction kernel that contains all two - body irreducible diagrams , @xmath9 is the total momentum with the bound state mass given by @xmath10 . in the present approach",
    "we do not consider the self - energy contribution , so that @xmath11 is the product of two free propagators , @xmath12 } \\frac{{\\rm i}}{\\left[(p/2-k)^2 -m^2 + { \\rm i}\\epsilon\\right ] } , \\ ] ] with @xmath13 the constituent mass .",

    "according to @xcite , we have solved eq .",
    "( [ nakie ] ) by using a basis function expansion of the nakanishi weight function , composed by laguerre polynomials @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) for describing the @xmath31-dependence ( where @xmath32 is an appropriate parameter , as discussed in @xcite ) and even gegenbauer polynomials @xmath33 for the @xmath34 one ( with @xmath35 ) .",

    "this last choice is dictated by the symmetry property of the nakanishi weight function @xmath40 , that is requested by the bosonic nature of the adopted constituents .",
    "it should be recalled that a definite statistical property of the bs amplitude avoids the so - called abnormal solutions of bse , namely the ones with negative norm @xcite , that are associated with excitations in relative time of the bound states ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a more recent discussion of the issue ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath41 dependence of @xmath42 entails a symmetry of the valence wave function , namely @xmath43 .    in our numerical approach ,",
    "accurate convergence was achieved for the ground state by using 14 laguerre ( @xmath44 ) and 10 gegenbauer ( @xmath45 ) polynomials .",
    "for the excited states , the convergence was reached with 26 laguerre and 10 gegenbauer polynomials . after introducing the basis function expansion and the ladder approximation eq .",
    "( [ ladder - ker ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ nakie ] ) turns into the matrix form of a generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "in particular , one can symbolically write @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the eigenvector . differently from the familiar non - relativistic case , in the eigen - equation ( [ symbnak ] ) the role of eigenvalue",
    "is played by the coupling constant @xmath48 , while the mass of the system @xmath49 is a parameter that can be assigned , after fixing the exchanged - scalar mass @xmath28 . in the standard way of analyzing the bse within the nir framework @xcite , one introduces the binding energy as @xmath50 which constrains the range of @xmath51 to the interval between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 , avoiding in this way the well - known instability of the @xmath55 model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our nir studies of the ladder bse , eq . ( [ symbnak ] ) has a pivotal role .",

    "the choice of such a large binding energy is motivated by the fact that strongly - bound states should be affected by large relativistic effects .",
    "first , we have verified that the values of @xmath57 for the binding energy of the ground state of @xmath64 , obtained with euclidean- and minkowski - space calculations are the same within our numerical accuracy .",
    "then , we have computed the excited state energies given in table [ comparison ] , achieving a very satisfactory agreement between the results evaluated in the two spaces . as a remark on the numerical procedure ,",
    "it should be pointed out that for values of @xmath65 smaller than 0.05 or @xmath66 the convergence is quite slow , and it is needed an extrapolation of the results with respect to @xmath67 , in order to accurately determine the eigenvalues .",
    "it is also important to show the behavior of energy ratios , @xmath68 with @xmath69 , for small @xmath51 and @xmath70 . for a bound state composed for two spinless bosons exchanging a massless scalar boson ,",
