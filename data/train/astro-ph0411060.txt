    "studies on ultra - high energy photons as primary cosmic rays have the potential to discern between different models of origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) .",
    "many top - down scenarios predict a dominance of photons in the cr flux above 10@xmath0  ev ( for a review see  @xcite ) , while according to classical acceleration scenarios in this energy range the cr flux should consist mainly of hadrons .",
    "thus , any experimental conclusions about a fraction of photons in uhecr , e.g. an upper limit on this fraction , are expected to provide constraints for the models of uhecr origin .",
    "presently , there are few experimental upper limits on photon fraction estimated on the basis of cosmic rays of energies above 10@xmath1  ev ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they are plotted in fig .",
    "[ plot - shin02-ul - ph ] and compared to the predictions of the three exemplary top - down models : super heavy dark matter ( shdm )  @xcite , z - bursts ( zb ) and topological defects ( td )  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the available limits are not very constraining since below 5@xmath210@xmath1  ev a typical predicted photon fraction is still low . above 10@xmath0",
    "ev , where the photon fraction predictions are larger , there is no experimental upper limit , although there are a few well documented cosmic ray events of such extremely large energies .",
    "while large amount of uhecr data from next generation giant cosmic - ray detectors is still on their way , in this work the available data of extensive air showers detected by the agasa experiment are analysed to derive an upper limit on the photon fraction in uhecr . in order to determine the probability of an event being initiated by a photon",
    "the muon densities measured on ground , which are expected to be good indicators of primary mass  @xcite , were compared to the simulations .",
    "among the 11 cosmic ray events above 10@xmath0  ev recorded by the agasa experiment  @xcite in 6 cases the muon densities at a distance of 1000 m from the shower core ( @xmath3 ) were measured and published in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see table  [ tab - agasa - sim ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath3 was evaluated to be @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the published energies and arrival directions were used for the simulation of photon - induced air showers .",
    "the effect of pre - cascading of photons in the geomagnetic field ( preshower effect )  @xcite and the subsequent air shower simulations were performed with use of the corsika package  @xcite with coupled preshower code  @xcite . for each of the 6 events with available experimental @xmath3 values ,",
    "100 photon - induced showers were simulated .",
    "this allowed obtaining 6 distributions of simulated muon densities @xmath5 at the observational level .",
    "the exact values of the reconstructed primary energies @xmath6 were published in ref . @xcite and updated on the agasa web page  @xcite .",
    "these values were obtained with accuracy of 25% , assuming that all the showers were initiated by hadrons . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , for photon - induced showers , @xmath6 underestimates the real primary energy by about 20% .",
    "this 20% correction was applied in all the photon - induced shower simulations presented here .      the basic approach to determine the probability of a primary photon origin of an individual event is quite similar to the one outlined in ref .",
    "the simulated distributions of @xmath5 were compared to the experimental values in the following way .",
    "it is assumed that the uncertainties connected to the measurements of the muon density @xmath3 for each agasa event follow the gaussian distribution with the uncertainty @xmath7 .",
    "the simulations for the energy and arrival direction of the j - th recorded event gave @xmath8 expected values @xmath9 , where index @xmath10 denotes the i - th simulated shower .",
    "the probability @xmath11 that @xmath12 differs by more than @xmath13 from the expected muon density @xmath9 is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the gaussian distribution .",
    "since @xmath16 , @xmath17 has a small ( less than 1% of @xmath18 ) contribution from negative values of muon densities @xmath19 .",
    "this contribution was accounted for by a simple renormalization of @xmath11 .",
    "the probability for the j - th event being initiated by an uhe photon , @xmath20 , was obtained by taking the average @xmath11 values . the experimental data",
