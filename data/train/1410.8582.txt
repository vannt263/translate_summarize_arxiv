    "conjecture [ op1 ] is equivalent to the assertion that @xmath623 a.s .",
    "it is known that the ordinary [ microscopic ] hausdorff dimension of the range of a lvy process is always equal to its ordinary [ microscopic ] _ lower _ minkowski dimension , and not always the upper minkowski dimension .",
    "if conjecture [ op1 ] were correct , then it would suggest that large - scale dimension theory of random walks is somewhat different from its small - scale counterpart .",
    "our next problem is an attempt to understand this difference better .",
    "barlow and taylor @xcite have introduced two other notions of macroscopic dimension that are related to our present interests .",
    "namely , they define the [ macroscopic ] _ lower minkowski dimension _ of @xmath524 and the _ lower hausdorff dimension _ of @xmath524 respectively as and @xmath624 in place of our @xmath625 and @xmath626 . ]",
    "@xmath627 one has @xmath628 and @xmath629 for all @xmath529 .",
    "it is easy to obtain a nontrivial upper bound for the lower minkowski dimension of @xmath17 , valid for every transient random walk @xmath9 on @xmath0 .",
    "namely , by and fatou s lemma , @xmath630      { \\leqslant}\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty } 2^{-n\\gamma } u({\\mathcal{v}}_n),\\ ] ] for every @xmath631 . from this we readily can deduce that @xmath632 we believe that this is a sharp bound , and thus propose the following .",
    "[ op2 ] with probability one , @xmath633    admittedly , we have not tried very hard to prove this , but it seems to be a natural statement .",
    "there are two other good reasons for our interest in conjecture [ op2 ] .",
    "first of all , it suggests that , as far as random walks and their analogous lvy processes are concerned , the more natural choice of `` macroscopic hausdorff dimension '' is @xmath634 and not @xmath7 , in contrast with the proposition of @xcite .",
    "also , if conjecture [ op2 ] were true , then together with theorem [ th : dim_m ] and proposition [ pr : gamma_c ] it would imply that regardless of whether or not conjecture [ op1 ] is true , @xmath29 always lies in the nonrandom interval @xmath635.$ ] the extrema of this interval are typically not hard to compute ; therefore , we at least will have easy - to - compute bounds for @xmath29 .",
    "let us state a third conjecture that is motivated also by conjecture [ op1 ] .",
    "choose and fix an arbitrary integer @xmath612 , and define @xmath636 to be @xmath431 independent copies of a symmetric , transient random walk @xmath9 on @xmath0 whose green s function satisfies the barlow ",
    "taylor condition for some @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "we can define an @xmath431-parameter _ additive random walk _ @xmath637 as follows ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) : for every @xmath638 , @xmath639 let @xmath640 denote the _ range _ of the random field @xmath641 .",
    "[ op3 ] suppose @xmath642 and @xmath643 .",
    "then for all nonrandom @xmath524 :    1 .   if @xmath644 , then @xmath645 is a.s .",
    "unbounded ; 2 .   if @xmath646 , then @xmath645 is a.s .  bounded .",
    "proposition [ pr : bt ] implies that conjecture [ op3 ] is correct if @xmath431 were replaced by @xmath107 ; the case @xmath643 has eluded our many attempts at solving this problem .",
    "it is possible to adapt the arguments of @xcite in order to derive conjecture [ op1 ] from conjecture [ op3 ] .",
    "we skip the details of that argument . instead",
    ", we conclude with two problems about the `` continuous version '' of corollary [ cor : main ] , which we recall , contained our hausdorff dimension formula for the range of a walk .",
    "let @xmath615 be a transient , but otherwise general , lvy process on @xmath154 whose characteristic exponent is @xmath647 , normalized as @xmath648 to be concrete .",
    "is there a formula for the a.s .- constant quantity @xmath649 that is solely in terms of @xmath647 ?",
    "before we state our last question let us define the _ upper minkowski dimension _ of a set @xmath650 as follows : define @xmath651 to be the union of all dyadic cubes @xmath652 of sidelength one that intersect @xmath65 .",
    "the _ macroscopic upper minkowski dimension _",
    "@xmath653 is defined , via the barlow ",
    "taylor upper minkowski dimension , as follows : @xmath654    the same proof that worked for @xmath529 works to show that @xmath655 for all @xmath534 .",
    "although we have not checked all of the details , we believe that the method of proof of theorem [ th : dim_m ] can be adapted to the continuous setting in order to produce @xmath656 where @xmath657 for all borel sets @xmath534 .    can one write an expression for @xmath658 solely in terms of @xmath647 ?    finally , we mention that conjecture [ op3 ] is likely to have a lvy process version wherein the role of the @xmath659s are replaced by that of isotropic @xmath68-stable lvy processes .",
    "we leave the statement [ and perhaps also a proof ! ] to the interested reader .",
