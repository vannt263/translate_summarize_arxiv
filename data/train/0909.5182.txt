    "numerous observational studies have shown that the population of massive galaxies at @xmath0 1.5 - 2.5 is significantly more compact than local galaxies of similar mass ( e.g. , daddi et al . 2005 ; trujillo et al .",

    "simple arguments based on the light profiles of these compact galaxies ( e.g. , bezanson et al .",
    "2009 , hopkins et al .",
    "2009 ) , as well as the evolution of their space density ( e.g. , van der wel et al .",
    "2009 , saracco et al .",
    "2009 ) suggest that these galaxies may be the progenitors of local early - type galaxies being assembled from the inside out , and these arguments are supported by recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , naab et al .",
    "thus far , little effort has been focused on how well - determined the stellar masses ( m@xmath4 ) of these galaxies are .",
    "indeed , claims about the total size growth of the galaxies , as well as explanations for the method of size growth based on their space density require us to associate these galaxies to local galaxies of a particular mass .",
    "it is well known that there can be serious systematic effects in photometrically - determined m@xmath4 s caused by assumptions about metallicity , the galactic extinction law , or the method of stellar population synthesis ( e.g. , maraston et al .",

    "2009 , longhetti & saracco 2009 , muzzin et al .",
    "furthermore , most models of high - z galaxies assume only simple star formation histories ( sfh ; usually parameterized by an exponentially - decreasing sfr with timescale @xmath3 ) . as suggested by earlier authors ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "2008 , hopkins et al .",
    "2009 , la barbera & de carvalho 2009 ) , if the compact galaxies have multi - age stellar populations with different spatial distributions , this may complicate our interpretation of their evolution . in this letter",
    "we investigate how robust the m@xmath4 of @xmath0 2.3 compact galaxies are , and how the uncertainties on these masses affect our interpretation of their size evolution .",
    "our sample of galaxies consists of the nine compact galaxies with strongly suppressed star formation presented in kriek et al .",
    "( 2006 ; 2008 ) .",
    "the relatively low star formation rates of these galaxies have been recently reconfirmed both by ultradeep spectroscopy ( kriek et al . 2009 ) , and sed modeling that includes the rest - frame nir ( muzzin et al .",
    "these galaxies have effective radii ( r@xmath5 ) of @xmath6 1 kpc as measured from nicmos h@xmath7-band imaging by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . the combination of accurate r@xmath5 s from space - based imaging , as well as the spectroscopic redshifts and well - sampled seds make this the best sample for testing the effect of assumptions in sed modeling of m@xmath8 on the inferred size evolution of massive galaxies . for these galaxies",
    "we adopt two methods for fitting the seds . in order to test the effects of metallicity , dust law , and sps code on the m@xmath4 we fit the galaxies to models with exponentially declining sfhs , hereafter `` @xmath3-models '' . in these models",
    "@xmath3 , age , and a@xmath9 are fit as free parameters .",
    "the sed fitting is performed using a @xmath10-minimization routine and the errors in m@xmath8 are determined using monte carlo simulations .",
    "details of the sed fitting procedure and parameter error estimation are described in muzzin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in attempt to isolate variables",
    "we adopt the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ; bc03 ) with solar metallicity , the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dust law , and a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf as the control model .",
    "this combination of models and parameters has been used extensively in previous studies of compact galaxies , and was the default model for the van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2008 ) study , making it the obvious choice for a control model .",
    "we compare the m@xmath4 from the control model to those determined with the dust law from the smc ( prvot et al .",
    "1984 ) and milky way ( fitzpatrick et al . 1986 ) , a subsolar ( 0.2z@xmath11 ) and supersolar ( 2.5z@xmath11 ) metallicity , as well as m@xmath4 from the sps codes of maraston ( 2005 ; hereafter m05 ) , and charlot & bruzual ( in preparation , hereafter cb07 ) .",
    "we also test the effects of a two - component stellar population on the m@xmath4 of the galaxies .",
    "the seds are fit with a linear combination of a `` young '' and `` old '' component .",
    "the young component has @xmath3 , age , and a@xmath9 as free parameters , but age restricted to @xmath12 0.5 gyr .",
    "the old component is a maximally old stellar population with no dust , and therefore has no free parameters .",
    "we perform the fitting three times , varying the amplitude of the old component between 10 , 20 , or 30% of the total observed h@xmath7-band light .",
    "we note this does not define the full range of m@xmath4 that could be allowed from two - component models ; however , the primary purpose of fitting these models is to explore the possibility of components with very different m / l ratios that could plausibly explain the sizes of the compact galaxies using age gradients .",
    "in the left panels of figure 1 we show the effects of the different assumptions in the sed modeling on the m@xmath4 of the compact galaxies by comparing their location in the r@xmath5 vs. m@xmath4 plane to galaxies from the sdss ( adapted from kauffman et al .",
    "2003 ; franx et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the right panels we show the mean observed sed of the entire sample as well as the mean fit .",
    "the @xmath13 of all fits are similar demonstrating that even with these high quality seds it is not possible to fit sps code , metallicity , dust law , or multiple components as free parameters .",
    "compared to the bc03 control model , the masses from the sps codes of m05 and cb07 are systematically lower by 0.13 dex . assuming a subsolar or supersolar metallicity systematically reduces the @xmath14m@xmath15 by 0.10 and 0.16 dex compared to their control values , respectively . the milky way dust law reduces the @xmath14m@xmath15 by 0.03 dex , whereas the smc dust law increases it by 0.06 dex .",
    "figure 1 shows that although all the sed modeling assumptions cause systematic differences in the m@xmath4 of the galaxies , none of them are large enough to change the fact that the galaxies are significantly more compact than local galaxies of similar mass .",
    "in fact , even if we combine the most extreme assumptions in the sed modeling , e.g. , the m05 models with supersolar metallicity , and the milky way dust law , the mean m@xmath4 is only 0.18 dex lower than the default modeling assumptions .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 1 shows the effect of the two - component models on m@xmath4 . adding an old stellar component to the modeling increases the overall m@xmath4 by 0.08 to 0.22 dex .",
    "interestingly , two - component fits from the models of bc03 have a better @xmath16 than from the m05 and cb07 models . in the left panel of figure 2",
    "we plot two - component fits using all three sps codes . in the right panel",
    "we plot the average old and young components of the fits using the bc03 models .",
    "two - component fits from m05 and cb07 models are probably poorer descriptions of the data because of the increased contributions from the tp - agb stars in those models .",
    "these stars contribute significantly to the rest - frame nir flux in young populations ( 0.2 - 2 gyr ) , and therefore , in these models the sed of both the young and old component have significant flux in the rest - frame nir , and their linear combination can not reproduce the overall sed shape .",
    "this suggests that models that explain the dramatic size evolution of these galaxies using age gradients in local galaxies ( e.g. , la barbera & de carvalho 2009 ) are unlikely to be compatible with our observed seds if interpreted with the m05 and cb07 models .",
    "for the single - component @xmath3-models , it is clear that changes in the sed modeling assumptions produce m@xmath4 values that are typically smaller on average than the default model .",
    "in particular , if we believe the newer sps models of m05 and cb07 provide more accurate masses than the bc03 models , then it has two implications for the method of size growth for these galaxies .",
    "first , assuming our sample of galaxies increase in m@xmath4 by a factor of @xmath17 2 from @xmath0 2.3 to @xmath18 0 , then to match the sizes of local galaxies they would have to increase in size by a factor of @xmath17 5 using the default model , and a factor of @xmath17 4 for the newer sps models .",
    "recent numerical simulations show size growth of a factor of @xmath6 3 , with an m@xmath4 increase of a factor of @xmath6 2 since @xmath19 = 2 ( e.g. , naab et al . 2009 ) , and therefore are in modestly better agreement with the size - mass relation from the newer sps models .",
    "second , the lower m@xmath4 from the m05 and cb07 models also allow for more simultaneous mass and size growth in the galaxies .",
    "bezanson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argued that given the m@xmath4 and number density of the @xmath0 2.3 galaxies , minor mergers are the best candidate for increasing the size of these galaxies because they increase the size faster than the m@xmath4 .",
    "if the compact galaxies have an @xmath14m@xmath15 that is 0.13 dex lower , the mass and number density argument still favors minor merging as the best candidate for size growth ; however , it would permit some fraction of the population to grow in size from major mergers .",
    "recently , mancini et al . (",
    "2009 ) claimed that using the newer sps models would reduce the offset of our galaxies from the local relation by a factor of @xmath6 3 , and inferred that this could significantly alter our interpretation of their size evolution .",
    "our modeling shows that this offset is only a factor of @xmath6 1.2 , and hence does not significantly alter the compact galaxy `` problem '' .",
    "mancini et al . (",
    "2009 ) also claimed that with the newer masses and a 25% systematic underestimate in sizes that some of the galaxies in our sample may follow the local relation ; however , figure 1 shows that this is not the case , and that even the galaxies that lie closest to the local relation are still a factor of @xmath17 2 off the relation .",
    "if the two - component models provide the correct masses , they suggest very different scenarios for size growth . assuming the spatial distribution of the old and young components is identical , then the size growth at fixed mass would be significantly larger than previous estimates , a factor of @xmath6 9 .",
    "furthermore , these galaxies would be roughly as massive as the most massive galaxies in the local sample , which means that the size growth would have to be extremely efficient , resembling a pure expansion model .",
    "such efficient size growth may not be required if the old component is significantly more extended than the young component .",
    "if so , the mass - weighted size of the galaxies could be much larger than its light - weighted size . in our sed fits",
    "the old component of these galaxies contain 10 - 30% of the total light",
    "( by construction ) , yet it contains 50 - 80% of the total stellar mass .",
    "indeed , we can not rule out the possibility that if the old component has an r@xmath5 of @xmath6 10 kpc and 50 - 80% of the mass , that we may be looking at fully formed early - type galaxies with compact , centrally concentrated poststarburst component in the center .",
    "however , local early - type galaxies tend to have only modest color gradients , most of which can be attributed to metallicity ( see e.g. , franx & illingworth 1990 , sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "2007 , kormendy et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these color gradients imply that galaxies have decreasing mass - to - light ratios with radius , and are therefore more compact in mass than in light , not the converse .",
    "it is possible that a combination of mergers and low - level star formation could mix the composite populations and create the locally - observed color gradients ; however , with the two - component sed modeling the @xmath0 2.3 galaxies are already as massive as the most massive local galaxies , leaving little room for structural changes caused by processes that require additional mass growth .",
    "another effect that could account for the extreme r@xmath5-m@xmath4 relation of the distant galaxies is an imf that becomes increasingly bottom - light at higher redshift .",
    "such an imf has been suggested for high redshift early - type galaxies ( van dokkum 2008 ) .",
    "if we fit our galaxies using the m05 models and the van dokkum ( 2008 ) bottom - light imf we find that the @xmath14m@xmath15 is lower by 0.30 dex .",
    "however , even with masses this low , these galaxies would still be a factor of @xmath6 3 smaller in size than local galaxies of similar mass .",
    "it is also worth noting that none of the compact galaxies show an observed 8@xmath2 excess ( rest - frame @xmath63@xmath2 ) above the best - fit sed template .",
    "these excesses are not uncommon in high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , labb et al .",
    "2005 ; donley et al .",
    "2008 , mentuch et al .",
    "2009 , muzzin et al . 2009 ) and could be caused by an agn .",
    "combined with the fact that none of the galaxies show emission lines , it suggests that the size measurements of these galaxies are not contaminated by an unresolved point source ( see also kriek et al .",
    "overall , our modeling shows that despite the numerous systematic uncertainties involved in determining photometric m@xmath4 s , the most extreme masses of the @xmath0 2.3 compact galaxies are 0.18 dex different from our nominal estimates using a normal imf , and 0.30 dex different using a bottom - light imf . from this",
    ", we conclude that on average these galaxies lie a factor of @xmath6 3 - 9 below this size - mass relation of local galaxies , depending on the sed models used",
    ". this range could be slightly larger because our comparisons have been made to the default sdss model .",
    "although using different sps models is unlikely to affect the m@xmath4 of the sdss galaxies because at old ages the bc03 and m05 models produce similar masses ( e.g. , m05 ) , and the dust content of the massive sdss galaxies should be negligible , there could be small systematic offsets between the sdss m@xmath4 and our m@xmath4 because of technical issues such as fiber aperture corrections , or the method of measuring total magnitudes .",
    "we note that other systematic effects may play a role . in particular",
    ", there may be systematic differences in the measurement of effective radii between the high and low redshift samples .",
    "van dokkum et al.(2008 ) , van der wel et al.(2008 ) , and hopkins et al .",
    "( 2009 ) show that biases due to surface brightness effects are probably small , but deeper data at high redshift would obviously be helpful .",
    "the low redshift data also have significant uncertainties : interestingly , guo et al.(2009 ) find that the sizes of the most luminous galaxies in the sdss nyu - vagc ( blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) are likely underestimated , which would imply somewhat stronger evolution than the factor 3 - 9 that we find here . with our data we still can not rule out age ( and hence m / l ) gradients in these galaxies , which could bias the size measurements of these galaxies ; however , such two - component models are disfavored by our data using the most recent sps codes .",
    "a two - component model is still compatible with our seds when using the bc03 models , therefore measuring color gradients in these galaxies out to large radii will be valuable for understanding if the luminosity - weighted sizes of these galaxies are comparable to their mass - weighted sizes .",
    "although the range of allowed photometric - m@xmath8 is only a few tenths of a dex , it is large enough that we advise caution when using the number density of galaxies larger than a given mass to identify the descendants of these galaxies at various redshifts .",
    "these galaxies sit on the exponential tail of the mass function ( e.g. , marchesini et al .",
    "2009 ) and therefore small , systematic differences in their photometric - m@xmath4 like those shown here could result in significant errors in their space density .",
    "ultimately , dynamical measurements are needed to calibrate photometric - m@xmath8 s at high redshift .",
    "early results suggest the agreement between the two is reasonable ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "2009 , cappellari et al .",
    "2009 ) ; however , it will be very important to extend these to large samples with a range of properties .",
