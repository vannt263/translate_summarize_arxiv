    "let @xmath6 be the surface with genus @xmath1 and @xmath7 boundary components ( when @xmath8 , we denote the surface by simply @xmath0 ) , and let @xmath9 .",
    "the _ curve complex _ of this surface , @xmath10 , is a simplicial complex whose vertices are isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves ( scc ) in @xmath6 . the vertices @xmath11 span a @xmath12-simplex if @xmath13 for each @xmath14 , where @xmath4 is the geometric intersection number .",
    "in other words , there is a representative curve of each isotopy class such that each pair of curves is disjoint from one another .",
    "we frequently equivocate between  a vertex of the curve complex , \"  an isotopy class of essential scc s , \" and  a representative of such a class . \"",
    "if @xmath15 , the _ arc and curve complex _ , @xmath16 , is defined similarly : its vertices are isotopy classes of essential scc s _ and _ isotopy classes of essential proper arcs ( isotopies do not necessarily fix the endpoints of an arc on @xmath17 ) ; simplex - spanning is defined in the same way .",
    "note that ( unsurprisingly ) the curve complex is a subcomplex of the arc and curve complex .",
    "the number @xmath18 is referred to as the _ complexity _ of the surface . if @xmath19 is a set of pairwise disjoint ( nonisotopic ) essential scc s on @xmath6 , then @xmath20 ( such a set of maximal size is known as a _ pants decomposition _ of the surface ) .",
    "we will be interested in the case where @xmath8 and @xmath21 .",
    "harvey introduced the curve complex in 1978 s @xcite , and it has become an important tool in the study of the mapping class group ( e.g. , @xcite ) , 3-manifolds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and teichmller space ( e.g. , @xcite , and it s original use in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in the _ curve graph _ , @xmath22 ( the 1-skeleton of the curve complex ) , two vertices are joined by an edge if they are disjoint .",
    "if we define each edge to have length 1 , then the curve graph is a metric space , where the distance @xmath23 is the minimum length of an edge - path from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( if such a path exists ) , or @xmath26 ( if it does not ) . since the curve complex is connected ( first proved in @xcite ) , every pair of vertices has finite distance , and the curve graph is a _ _ geodesic space__@xmath27i.e . , there is a path of minimal length ( a _ geodesic _ ) connecting any two vertices .",
    "although distance is defined in terms of intersections , there is not a strict relationship between intersection number and distance . broadly speaking",
    ", large distance implies large intersection number ( specifically , @xmath28 + 2 $ ] ( @xcite ) ) ; curves with large intersection number will generally have large distance , but this need not be the case .",
    "there are some facts that we can assert in simple cases , however .",
    "if @xmath29 is 1 or 2 , then @xmath30 ( if we take an annular neighborhood of @xmath31 , the components of its boundary will be disjoint from both curves , and at least one of them will be essential ) .    the pair @xmath2 is a _ filling pair _ if no essential scc is disjoint from @xmath32i.e .",
    ", any essential scc must intersect at least one of the pair .",
    "it s clear from the definition that @xmath33 if and only if @xmath2 is a filling pair .    in a closed surface @xmath0",
    ", @xmath2 is a filling pair if and only if @xmath34 is a union of disks .",
    "these disks are shaped like polygons with alternating @xmath24-and @xmath25-edges ; the curves partition each other into arcs and , when we cut the surface apart into disks , we produce two copies of each arc .",
    "if one of these disk - regions has two edges which are copies of the same arc then , by connecting them , we produce an essential scc which intersects one of the pair @xmath2 once and is disjoint from the other : by fact 2 , it follows that @xmath35 .",
    "it can be shown that , for a filling pair on @xmath0 , we have @xmath36 and that , in the case of minimal intersection number , @xmath35 ( see proposition 3.1 ) .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the surface @xmath0 together with a minimally - intersecting filling pair .",
    "let mod(@xmath0 ) denote the _ mapping class group _ of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the group of homotopy _ classes _ of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms ( _ mappings _ ) on @xmath0 .",
    "this group acts on @xmath0 and we identify curves in the surface according to this action@xmath27thus _ an _ @xmath37 is @xmath0 with a particular filling pair , and a homeomorphically different filling pair on the same surface is a _ different _ @xmath37 . in their 2015 paper @xcite , aougab and",
    "huang addressed the following questions :    1 .",
    "for which genera @xmath1 does an @xmath37 exist ? 2 .",
    "how many @xmath37s are there for a given @xmath1 ?",
    "they showed that an @xmath37 exists for every genus @xmath5 , and then demonstrated upper and lower bounds on the number of distinct @xmath37s .",
    "specifically , they proved the following :    let @xmath38 be the number of @xmath37s ( the number of mod(@xmath0)-orbits of minimally - intersecting filling pairs on @xmath0 )",
    ". then there exists a function @xmath39 such that @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "to prove these bounds , they introduced a means of representing the filling pair @xmath2 on @xmath37 by a permutation @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the symmetric group on @xmath44 symbols ( this @xmath45 is known as a _ filling permutation _ of @xmath2 ) .",
    "it will be useful to note here that a defining feature of @xmath45 is that it satisfies the equation    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are permutations defined in section 2 below .",
    "they then demonstrated that the mod(@xmath0)-orbit of @xmath2 corresponds to a special conjugacy class of @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely :    let @xmath2 and @xmath49 be minimally - intersecting filling pairs on @xmath0 , and let @xmath50 be filling permutations for the two pairs , respectively .",
    "there is a subgroup @xmath51 such that @xmath2 and @xmath49 belong to the same mod(@xmath0)-orbit if and only if @xmath45 and @xmath52 are conjugate by an element of @xmath53 .",
    "this @xmath53 is independent of the pair @xmath2 : all homeomorphic filling pairs have filling permutations which are conjugate by an element of @xmath53 .",
    "the upper bound , then , is simply the maximum number of such conjugacy classes : the maximum number of possible filling permutations divided by the minimum possible order of @xmath53 .    to prove the lower bound ( as well as the mere existence of _ any _ @xmath37s ) , aougab and huang produced an explicit construction",
    "this construction involves producing a higher - genus @xmath54 from one of lower genus by iteratively attaching  @xmath55-pieces \" : copies of a fixed surface @xmath55 of genus 2 , together with a filling pair that intersect six times .",
    "see figure [ zfig ] .     with curves @xmath24 ( shown in red ) and @xmath25 ( shown in black ) .",
    "the green vertex is adjacent to all four regions.[zfig ] ]    a @xmath55-piece is attached to an @xmath37 by connected sum : delete a disk neighborhood from each surface , and then identify the boundary curves produced by this deletion .",
    "this produces the surface @xmath56 . producing a minimally - intersecting filling pair on this new surface requires a particular choice of the deleted disks .",
    "the filling pair on @xmath55 has a distinguished intersection which is adjacent to each of the ( four ) complementary regions of the filling pair ( throughout this paper , we will refer to this intersection as the  green vertex \" ) . by deleting a disk neighborhood of the green vertex from @xmath55 and a disk neighborhood of _ any _ intersection of @xmath37 , we create boundary in the curves : they become arcs .",
    "when we identify the boundaries of the surfaces ( circles ) , we simultaneously identify the boundaries of these arcs ( endpoints on the circles ) .",
    "this produces a filling pair on @xmath56 with exactly the minimum number of intersections on the new surface@xmath27i.e .",
    ", it produces an @xmath57 .",
    "figures [ cutsurfacesfig ] and [ f3fig ] illustrate the case @xmath58 .     and @xmath59 with appropriate disks removed .",
    "the curves @xmath24 and @xmath25 on @xmath55 and @xmath59 are now arcs.[cutsurfacesfig ] ]    ]    this splits the existence problem into two cases : odd genus and even genus . to show , for arbitrary @xmath1 , that an @xmath37 exists , it suffices to show that an @xmath59 exists ( if @xmath1 is odd ) or an @xmath60 exists ( if @xmath1 is even ) ; it follows by induction that an @xmath37 exists .",
    "there is an obvious candidate on @xmath61namely , the longitudinal and meridional curves of the torus , which intersect @xmath62 time@xmath27and so existence follows for all odd genera .",
    "it turns out that there is no @xmath63if @xmath2 is a filling pair on @xmath64 , then @xmath65however , this is the only defect in the result : there exists an @xmath66 and , therefore , existence follows for all even genera @xmath67 .    because the construction allows us to select any intersection on @xmath37 at which to attach a @xmath55-piece ,",
    "there are ( usually ) many different ways to produce a filling pair on the same surface @xmath0 ; moreover , each time we attach a @xmath55-piece , we add four new intersections , which means we increase the number of choices of attachment point for each successive @xmath55-piece . in light of this observation",
    ", it makes sense intuitively that the lower bound will be exponential in @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain it ( up to asymptotic equivalence ) by taking the _ minimum _ number of filling permutations that can be constructed by successive additions of @xmath55-pieces divided by the _",
    "maximum _ order of @xmath53 .",
    "it is a vital factor in counting the minimum number of possible filling permutations that @xmath55-pieces can always be removed _ cleanly _ : given an @xmath37 with @xmath68 , if it is possible to decompose @xmath37 in more than one way into a connected sum@xmath27say , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , with @xmath71then @xmath55 and @xmath72 can overlap only on the boundary curves where each piece is attached to the larger surface : the interiors of the two surfaces must be disjoint ( note that the  remainder \" surfaces @xmath73 and @xmath74 may be different ) . by successively removing @xmath55-pieces , we could ( in principle , at least ) decompose an @xmath37 uniquely into an irreducible  kernel \" surface with @xmath55-pieces attached at specified points .",
    "this hints at a more general phenomenon , and prompts us to ask a number of questions :    1 .",
    "is @xmath55 the only piece ? that is ,",
    "does there exist an @xmath37 that decomposes as @xmath75 , where the filling pairs on @xmath64 and @xmath55 are _ not _ homeomorphic ? 2 .",
    "are there higher - genus pieces ?",
    "is it possible to perform constructions or obtain decompositions of surfaces of the form + @xmath76 + where @xmath77 has genus @xmath12 with @xmath78 ?",
    "is there a criterion that will determine when a surface admits a decomposition like that in ( [ decompeqn ] ) , and that will indicate how to perform the decomposition ?    each of these questions is answered below in the affirmative . perhaps unsurprisingly",
    ", the decomposition criterion depends on filling permutations . specifically :    let @xmath37 be a surface of genus @xmath41 together with a filling pair @xmath2 which intersect @xmath79 times , and let @xmath42 be a filling permutation for @xmath2 . then @xmath37 admits a decomposition of the form ( [ decompeqn ] ) if and only if there exist  appropriately separated \" numbers @xmath80 which satisfy a list of six permutation equations involving @xmath81 , and @xmath48 .    see theorem 5.1 below for the full statement of the result .    as we have said",
    "( see fact 4 ) , if @xmath2 is the filling pair on an @xmath37 , then @xmath35 . by extending @xmath37 into an @xmath57 , we map this pair of vertices in @xmath82 to a pair @xmath83 in @xmath84 with the same distance ( since the new pair intersects minimally on the new surface ) .",
    "but we achieved this extension by performing a surgery in a disk neighborhood of one point of @xmath85 ; since we can isotope any other scc in @xmath37 away from this neighborhood , it follows that no other curve is affected by the extension .",
    "thus the map @xmath86 acts as inclusion on every other curve in @xmath37 ; we therefore have an embedding of one curve graph into the other which does not increase distance : all intersection numbers among curves in @xmath37 other than @xmath24 and @xmath25 are preserved ( including intersections of either @xmath24 or @xmath25 with any _ other _ curve ) , and so any path in @xmath87 connecting two such vertices is embedded in @xmath88 .",
    "we have a similar embedding @xmath89 .",
    "a surface @xmath90 is an _ essential subsurface _ of @xmath0 if @xmath91 and every boundary component of @xmath90 is an essential curve in @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath90 is not an annulus , we have the following map on 0-skeleta , @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 denotes the power set ) : for a vertex in @xmath94 , take a representative @xmath95 of its class that intersects @xmath90 minimally ; then @xmath96 .",
    "the image of @xmath95 is a ( possibly empty ) union of disjoint curves and/or arcs@xmath27the segments of @xmath95 where it cuts through the subsurface .",
    "this map @xmath97 is the _ subsurface projection_.    @xmath98 ( the surface with one of its vertices removed ) can be thought of as an essential subsurface of @xmath57 ; for every curve @xmath95 in @xmath37 other than @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath99 ( since @xmath100 is completely contained in @xmath98 ) , and so the subsurface projection sends @xmath100 to @xmath95 : @xmath101 is the identity on all vertices of @xmath82 except @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( and similarly for @xmath97 and @xmath102 , where @xmath90 is @xmath55 with the green vertex removed , viewed as a subsurface of @xmath57 ) .",

    "thus , filling permutations in @xcite are always a single cycle , while our definition allows them to have more than one cyclic factor .",
