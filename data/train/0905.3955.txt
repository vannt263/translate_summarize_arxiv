    "while our understanding of the physics of electron correlation has matured , there are still intriguing avenues that are yet to be fully explored .",
    "one such avenue is strongly correlated electron systems in nonequilibrium situations .",
    "while there are a body of intense studies on nonequilibrium states in strong ac fields such as strong light sources that can trigger photo - induced insulator - to - metal transitions ( see @xcite and refs therein ) , or nonequilibrium states in strong dc electric fields that can introduce pair - creation of electron and holes in dielectric breakdown @xcite , here we pursue yet another situation , where nonequilibrium states are conceived for an open , correlated electron system coupled to electrodes ( fig.[fig : phasediagram ] ( a ) inset ) .",
    "two effects are expected to arise from the bias voltage @xmath0 across the electrodes .",
    "one is bi - carrier doping , i.e. , electrons and holes are simultaneously doped , since two fermi energies exist due to the two electrodes .",
    "naively one might guess that this can make the system superconducting with cooper pairs formed by electrons or holes at half - filling , but this has to be tested .",
    "there is in fact the second effect , i.e. , the electron - electron scattering in nonequilibrium that makes the originally sharp fermi surface to be smeared .",
    "the smearing is expected to degrade magnetic orders @xcite , which in our case implies that the smearing should act to reduce antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the natural question then is : will this also destroy the @xmath1-wave superconducting state ?",
    "here we study this problem , which is motivated by two recent experimental developments .",
    "one is the fabrication of functional structures with oxides @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , properties such as superconducting transition in a clean electron gas formed at an interface of two insulating oxides was studied , while ueno _ et al .",
    "_ have succeeded in controlling the superconducting transition in an electrolyte - srtio@xmath2 system by changing the applied voltage .",
    "nonlinear transport properties near the mott transition at interfaces have also been theoretically studied in @xcite .",
    "the second motivation comes from an experimental observation by pothier _",
    "_ of a nonequilibrium electron distribution  the double - step fermi distribution  in a mesoscopic copper wire attached to two electrodes @xcite .",
    "they showed that the step in the fermi distribution is rounded due to electron scattering .",
    "such a smearing effect is expected to be even stronger in correlated electron systems , so that it is theoretically imperative to develop a method for dealing with the nonequilibrium distribution of quasi - particles in a self - consistent manner in order to examine the nature of nonequilibrium phase transitions in correlated systems .",
    "here we perform this by using the keldysh method , while the interaction is treated within the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) @xcite .",
    "the superconductivity transition is studied with the linearized eliashberg equation .",
    "we briefly comment on the past studies on superconductivity transition out of equilibrium . in a pioneering work by chang and scalapino @xcite who have solved the electron - phonon model self - consistently ,",
    "it was pointed out that nonequilibrium conditions such as irradiation of light can cause the quasiparticle distribution function to deform , and , under certain conditions , can lead to higher @xmath3 as observed in conventional @xmath4-wave superconductors @xcite . in more recent attempts , critical properties near an insulator - superconductor transition",
    "were studied in @xcite followed by several authors @xcite .    here",
    "we adopt the hubbard model , a prototype in the study of magnetism , superconductivity and other phase transitions in correlated electron systems .",
    "in the two - dimensional square lattice near half - filling , the groundstate is the mott insulator with an antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "when chemically doped with carriers ( electrons or holes ) , it is believed that cooper pairs are formed with @xmath1-wave symmetry and the system becomes superconducting , @xcite as also discussed phenomenologically in @xcite .",
    "so the question here is what happens in nonequilibrium .",
    "we consider a thin layer of strongly correlated material described by the two - dimensional hubbard model which is coupled to electrodes . here we have assumed for simplicity the top and bottom electrodes ( fig.[fig : phasediagram ] ( a ) inset ) , since we want to single out the effect of different chemical potentials between the two electrodes , while a lateral attachment of the electrodes would cause a change in the spatial symmetry of the phases .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hubbard hamiltonian with the hopping integral @xmath7 ( taken to be the unit of energy hereafter ) and the repulsive interaction @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is the system - electrode coupling where we label the top ( bottom ) electrodes with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the electrode hamiltonian .",
    "the electrode electrons ( created by @xmath12 ) are free fermions having correlators @xmath13 with @xmath14 the fermi distribution function with electrode - dependent chemical potential @xmath15 . the effect of the electrode can be taken into account with the schwinger - dyson equation , where the self - energy , @xmath16 consists of the contributions from the electrodes and those from the interaction . here",
    "@xmath17 denote , respectively , the retarded , advanced , lesser , greater , and keldysh components ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the electrode self - energy becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the coupling strength between the system and the electrodes@xcite , @xmath15 the respective chemical potential of the electrodes , and the energy dependence in the density of states is neglected .",
    "here the temperature @xmath20 of the two electrodes is kept to be the same , and we adopt @xmath21 . we note that if the coupling is too strong ( @xmath22 ) , no ordering takes place .",
    "nonequilbrium phase transitions can be studied by combining the keldysh formalism with the flex to examine instabilities of the nonequilbrium normal state against magnetic and superconducting states .",
    "the self - energy arising from the electron interaction is given , in nonequilbrium , by @xmath23 where @xmath24 are momenta , @xmath25 the frequency , and @xmath26 the number of @xmath27-points considered .",
    "the retarded component of the self - energy is determined from @xmath28 where the real part is obtained via kramers - kronig s relation .",
    "such relations between the lesser , greater and retarded components exist for other quantities as well .",
    "the fluctuation - mediated interaction , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 represent the spin ( charge ) susceptibilities , whose retarded components are @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the irreducible susceptibility , @xmath34 the lesser and greater components of spin and charge susceptibilties @xmath35 are determined by solving the dyson equation . for @xmath36 , it is expressed by @xmath37 obtained with aid of the langreth rules and can be solved by @xmath38 similar expressions exist for @xmath39 .",
    "finally , green s function is determined from the self - energy through the schwinger - dyson equation , @xmath40 for the retarded and advanced components , and @xmath41 for the keldysh component@xcite with the bare green s function @xmath42 the process is repeated until a self - consistent solution is obtained . the _ nonequilibrium distribution function _",
    "@xmath43 can be extracted@xcite from the relation , @xmath44 we seek for a self - consistent solution of the above equations with iteration until the self - energy converges . in the calculation",
    "we take a 64 @xmath45 64 grid for the square brillouin zone , while an almost logarithmic mesh @xcite with 301 points for the @xmath25-axis is used .",
    "we shall see that the distribution function @xmath43 deviates significantly from its non - interacting form ( double step fermi function ) , @xmath46/(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2 ) , \\label{eq : f0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath47 being the fermi - dirac distribution ) as an effect of the strong interaction .",
    "the superconducting transition is studied in terms of the linearized eliashberg equation , here extended to nonequilibrium .",
    "to this end , we iteratively ( @xmath48 ) obtain the anomalous self - energy @xmath49 and anomalous green s function @xmath50 using @xmath51 , @xmath52 obtained in the previous step . with a random initial guess for @xmath53 , green s function",
    "is determined from the linearized nambu - gorkov equation , @xmath54/2,\\\\ x&=&[\\sigma^r(\\omega)+(\\sigma^{r}(-\\omega))^*]/2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the keldysh component is calculated with the generalized distribution function , @xmath55 we assume here that the distribution for the anomalous component is the same as that for the normal component .",
    "finally , we plug this into the eliashberg equation , @xmath56 where the effective interaction in the spin - singlet channel is @xmath57 the eigenvalue of the linearized eliashberg equation is obtained as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the norm .",
    "the superconducting transition takes place when @xmath60 exceeds unity .    before moving on to the results , we comment on the applicability of the flex on the magnetic transition . in our formalism , we have used the rpa expression for the susceptibility combined with the flex following ref.@xcite . in equilibrium",
    ", this approximation gives a phase diagram for magnetic and superconducting transitions where the superconducting phase cuts the af dome .",
    "the formalism has limitations in that ( a ) it can not describe the mott physics or the pseudo - gap , and ( b ) the magnetic transition is not recovered when one uses the flex spin susceptibility instead of the rpa form ( see @xcite ) . thus the approach developed here should be considered to be limited to the weak - coupling regime .",

    "we have applied the above formalism to obtain the nonequilibrium phase diagram for the two - dimensional ( square lattice ) hubbard model attached to two electrodes by numerically solving the equations self - consistently . in equilibrium",
    "the phase diagram within flex as obtained in @xcite has an antiferromagnetic phase when the doping level @xmath75 is small , which is taken over by a @xmath1-wave superconductivity as @xmath76 is increased . so the interest is how the nonequilibrium situation modifies these .",
    "we first plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : statedata](a ) the spin susceptibility @xmath77 for @xmath62 and a doping level @xmath63 the result shows that the antiferromagnetic fluctuation remains strong near half - filling , for which we have four incommensurate peaks around @xmath78 in @xmath27-space , as in equilibrium .",
    "the effect of increased bias is that the peak height is reduced , and the peak position on energy axis shifts upwards as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : statedata ] ( c ) , where @xmath66 for @xmath79 is plotted .",
    "we notice that no features such as dip or hump appear around @xmath80 . the dominant superconducting solution in fig .",
    "[ fig : statedata](b ) is again similar to the equilibrium case , that is , the @xmath1-wave gap has the largest @xmath70 for the linearized eliashberg equation .",
    "however , the critical temperature @xmath3 at which @xmath70 reaches unity depends on @xmath0 , as shown by the temperature dependence of @xmath70 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : statedata](d ) .",
    "so the bias @xmath0 reduces @xmath3 , until finally the superconducting state no longer exists even at zero temperature when the bias becomes too strong .",
    "we define this as the _ critical bias _",
    "@xmath81 . for the region of the band",
    "filling for which the antiferromagnetic order dominates over the superconducting state , we can define the bias - dependent nel temperature @xmath82 as the temperature at which the spin susceptibility diverges@xcite .",
    "the spin susceptibility is reduced as the bias in increased , until the antiferromagnetic order vanishes even at zero temperature beyond the ",
    "critical nel bias \" @xmath83 .",
    "the doping dependence of the nel bias and the critical temperatures for a fixed bias is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ( a ) .",
    "we can see that , while the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase is relatively persistent , the superconducting ( sc ) region rapidly shrinks with the bias @xmath0 and disappears at @xmath84 .",
    "the phase diagram at zero - temperature is plotted on the @xmath73 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ( b ) .",
    "the nel bias , peaked at the undoped point with @xmath85 , decreases with the doping , and the af phase is replaced with the sc phase around @xmath86 with a maximum critical bias for sc @xmath87 .",
    "as we further increase the doping , the sc phase finally disappears .",
    "figure [ fig : phasediagram ] ( c ) schematically summarizes the phase transitions in the @xmath74 space .",
    "as was experimentally found in a tunneling measurement in a mesoscopic wire of copper by pothier _",
    "et al._,@xcite the nonequilibrium electron distribution becomes smeared from the simple , double - step fermi distribution @xmath88 due to electron scattering . in correlated materials with a strong electron - electron interaction , we expect a greater smearing effect to take place .",
    "indeed , as we shall reveal below , the key feature to understand the nonequilibrium phase diagram for the open hubbard model may be captured by the way in which the nonequilibrium distribution function is rounded by the interaction effect .     or @xmath89 , at half filling ( @xmath90 ) .",

    "( c ) the smearing parameter @xmath93 against the bias @xmath0 for various values of @xmath76 and fixed @xmath64 and @xmath94 .",
    "fitting errors are smaller than the size of each symbol . ]",
    "figure [ fig : distribution ] ( a ) plots the effective distribution @xmath43 defined in eq.([eq : feff ] ) obtained self - consistently for two values of the bias @xmath0 .",
    "the temperature in the electrodes , hence in @xmath88 , is set to zero . if we compare the result with the corresponding noninteracting distribution function @xmath88 ( eq.([eq : f0 ] ) )",
    "( dashed lines ) , @xmath43 is seen to significantly deviate from @xmath88 .",
    "more importantly , we find here that the _ effective temperature approximation breaks down _ , that is , we can not fit @xmath43 to @xmath88 with the temperature as a fitting parameter .",
    "instead , the best fit to the data is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the fitting parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath93 having the dimension of energy represents the extent to which the distribution is smeared from the double - step function .",
    "we have found in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] ( b ) that the fitting function eq.([eq : fit ] ) is adequate in the present open hubbard model in that all the data for various values of the parameters ( @xmath98 ) are reproduced within the numerical errors . if we specifically plot the bias - dependence of the smearing parameter in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] ( c ) , we can see that they fall upon an universal curve . when @xmath0 is small",
    ", one can approximate this with a linear relation , @xmath99 the proportionality constant depends on the interaction strength @xmath8 and the coupling @xmath100 to the electrodes , but not on the filling @xmath76 as seen from the figure .",
    "the constant is reduced when the coupling to the electrode becomes stronger .    from the viewpoint of the smeared distribution",
    ", we can conceive the bias - driven phase transitions in the following way .",
    "we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ( b ) that the af ( sc ) orders die out at @xmath101 ( @xmath84 ) respectively . in terms of eq.([tauproptov ] ) , these values correspond to the smearing parameters @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we can then note that these values are similar to the highest nel ( critical ) temperatures in the zero bias phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ( a ) , upper panel ) .",
    "thus , the transition takes place when the smearing parameter @xmath93 attains a value ( _ depth _ of each phase in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ( c ) as translated to @xmath93 ) that is similar to the transition temperature ( _ height _ in the same phase diagram ) .",
    "af spin fluctuations are suppressed in finite bias voltages in this manner , which is similar to what happens in itinerant electron magnets @xcite .",
    "we have obtained a nonequilibrium phase diagram for the two - dimensional hubbard model , and pointed out the possibility of controlling the phases in strongly correlated heterostructures ( i.e. , electrode - system - electrode ) by external bias .",
    "both of af and sc regions shrink with the bias @xmath0 , which we attribute to the smearing of the nonequilibrium distribution function . while the smearing can be reduced if we make the system more strongly coupled to the electrodes ( in e.g. a thinner sample ) , this will lead to the destruction of orders because a larger coupling @xmath100 to electrodes will make the spin fluctuations weaker .",
    "thus we conclude the smearing of the distribution function is an important property characterizing correlated electron systems out of equilibrium , and an experimental verification of this should be interesting .",
    "we have to make a caution that flex employed here has limitations in that it ignores the vertex correction , and can not address , due to its weak - coupling nature , the behavior close to the mott insulator point , as mentioned . effects of electrodes ( on e.g. the pairing symmetry ) when they are attached laterally are also intriguing .",
    "a more ambitious future problem is a possibility of bi - carrier induced superconductivity in nonequilibrium , for which the present formalism may serve as a starting point ."
