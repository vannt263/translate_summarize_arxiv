    "<S> we study strongly coupled lattice qcd with @xmath0 colors of staggered fermions in @xmath1 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> while mean field theory describes the low temperature behavior of this theory at large @xmath0 , it fails in the scaling region close to the finite temperature second order chiral phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the universal critical region close to the phase transition belongs to the 3d @xmath2 universality class even when @xmath0 becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to gross - neveu models where the critical region shrinks as @xmath0 ( the number of flavors ) increases and mean field theory is expected to describe the phase transition exactly in the limit of infinite @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our work demonstrates that close to second order phase transitions infrared fluctuations can sometimes be important even when @xmath0 is strictly infinite .    </S>",
    "<S> mean field techniques provide a simple but powerful approach to gain qualitative insight of the underlying physics in a variety of field theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) solution to superconductivity is a well known application of such a technique . </S>",
    "<S> wilson s renormalization group shows that when correlation lengths @xmath3 , associated with the fluctuations of the field , become large compared to the microscopic length scale @xmath4 of the problem , mean field techniques become exact in dimensions greater than four . </S>",
    "<S> however , in lower dimensional systems infrared fluctuations can become important when @xmath5 and invalidate the mean field arguments . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the mean field approach must be used with care close to second order phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the region close to the critical point where mean field theory fails is usually referred to as the ginsburg region @xcite . using field theoretic techniques sometimes it is possible to estimate the ginsburg region . in conventional superconductors the ginsburg region </S>",
    "<S> is known to be suppressed by some power of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the critical temperature and @xmath8 is the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> mean field theory is believed to be reliable outside the ginsburg region . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why bcs is a good approach to understand the physics of superconductivity for all temperatures except very close to @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are certain limits in which the infrared fluctuations can be naturally suppressed even in low dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example consider a theory containing a field with @xmath0 components . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 is large a saddle point approximation can be used to solve the theory and the leading term is nothing but the mean field solution . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical physicists often use this feature to solve a physical theory by increasing the number of components of the field artificially . by solving the theory in the limit of large number of components and computing the leading corrections they can sometimes estimate realistic answers in the physical theory . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of field theories can be studied in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although large @xmath0 approach to field theories has been very successful , in this article we show that not all large @xmath0 limits lead to the suppression of infrared fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast two models , the gross - neveu ( gn ) model involving @xmath0 species of fermions studied recently @xcite and strongly coupled @xmath9 lattice qcd with staggered fermions ( sclqcd ) studied here . </S>",
    "<S> both these models contain a global symmetry which is spontaneously broken at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> further , the symmetry group and the breaking pattern is not affected by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these models undergo a second order phase transition to a symmetric phase at a finite critical temperature @xmath7 . in the large @xmath0 limit </S>",
    "<S> they can be solved exactly using mean field techniques at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question then is whether the mean field description is valid even close to @xmath7 when @xmath0 becomes infinite .    </S>",
    "<S> it was discovered in @xcite that indeed in the gn model the critical behavior near @xmath7 belongs to the landau - ginsburg mean field universality class at large @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the ginsburg region , where the critical behavior is governed by a non - trivial universality class that depends on the symmetry group and the breaking pattern in a dimensionally reduced theory , has a zero width at large @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it was later shown in @xcite that indeed the ginsburg region is suppressed by a factor @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> although a @xmath11 symmetric gn model was analyzed in @xcite , there are reasons to believe that the arguments would hold for continuous symmetries as well @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as we will demonstrate here , in contrast to the gn model , the ginsburg region does not shrink in sclqcd in the large @xmath0 limit . </S>",
    "<S> while mean field theory is indeed a good approximation at low temperatures , the finite temperature phase transition is not described by mean field theory even at infinite @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe our results should be of interest to a wide range of physicists since our model can be mapped into a theory of classical dimers . </S>",
    "<S> dimer models have a long history @xcite . in the 1960s </S>",
    "<S> these models attracted a lot of attention when it was shown that the ising model can be rewritten as a dimer model @xcite . in the late 1980s they gained popularity again in their quantum version @xcite as a promising approach to the famous resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) liquid phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , this approach has gained momentum again since it was shown that the rvb phase was indeed realized on a triangular lattice but not on a cubic lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus physicists attempting to use large @xmath0 techniques in dimer models can benefit from our results .    </S>",
    "<S> the partition function of sclqcd is given by @xmath12 [ d\\psi d\\bar\\psi]\\ \\exp\\left(-s[u,\\psi,\\bar\\psi]\\right ) , \\label{unpf}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 $ ] is the haar measure over @xmath9 matrices and @xmath14 $ ] specify grassmann integration . </S>",

    "<S> unfortunately , since the algorithm was inefficient at small quark masses , the finite temperature chiral phase transition was never studied in the large @xmath0 limit . recently </S>",
    "<S> a very efficient cluster algorithm was discovered to solve the model at any value of @xmath0 @xcite . using this algorithm it was shown with great precision that for @xmath45 the finite temperature phase transition belonged to the 3d @xmath2 universality class @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the solid lines represent the fit to @xmath66 which is expected from 3d xy model . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath67 for different @xmath0 are given in the text.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one might think that it is quite easy to explain why the mean field theory breaks down close to @xmath7 . since @xmath7 grows as @xmath0 , the large @xmath0 theory does not know about the existence of a finite @xmath7 unless the @xmath49 corrections are included . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed these corrections and have found that they do not improve the situation much . perhaps one needs to develop a new mean field expansion where one holds @xmath68 fixed as @xmath0 becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> let us refer to this as the finite @xmath26 mean field theory ( ftmft ) . </S>",
    "<S> although we have not yet developed this mean field theory , we will argue that it is bound to fail close to @xmath7 since the ginsburg region where the 3d @xmath2 universality class is observed does not shrink with @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> the inset shows the same graph for a larger range of @xmath65 for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the text describes the physics of this plot.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    since @xmath67 decreases with increasing @xmath0 one might argue that @xmath67 will vanish in the limit @xmath77 . in that case </S>",
    "<S> some higher order term will become dominant in the large @xmath0 limit and it is not possible to rule out mean field behavior . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not think this is the case and attribute the change in @xmath67 to a renormalization effect as a function of @xmath0 . in order to justify this , </S>",
    "<S> we next focus on a correlation length scale which does not need renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> if correlation lengths in the theory indeed scale with @xmath0 , we would expect the correlation lengths to be the same at any fixed @xmath65 . in our model @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> can be defined as one such inverse correlation length scale . </S>",
    "<S> this implies @xmath78 , where @xmath79 in the 3d @xmath2 model @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we plot @xmath55 as a function of @xmath65 for @xmath80 . when @xmath81 all the points at a fixed @xmath65 but at different @xmath0 fall on top of each other . further , when @xmath71 , all the data points fit extremely well to the form @xmath82 , with @xmath83 with a @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this is strong evidence that even at infinite @xmath0 the phase transition belongs to the 3d @xmath2 universality class . outside the ginsburg region one would expect ftmft to be valid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , when @xmath85 we find that the data fits to the form @xmath86 with @xmath87 with a @xmath88 , suggesting @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we suspect that the ftmft in our model is similar to the mean field theory in 3d @xmath90 models which yields @xmath91 . the cross over to mean field theory occurs when @xmath92 so that the correlation length is @xmath93 in lattice units .    </S>",
    "<S> one often hears the lore that in the large @xmath0 limit sclqcd is solvable using mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> while this is true in certain cases , in this article we have demonstrated that the finite temperature chiral phase transition belongs to the 3d @xmath2 universality class even in the large @xmath0 limit . in an earlier study we found similar results in two spatial dimensions @xcite . in two dimensions </S>",
    "<S> continuous symmetries can not break at any finite temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however an @xmath40 symmetry is special and a phase transition in the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) universality class is possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bkt prediction for our model is that @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a function of temperature @xmath96 when @xmath97 . at the critical temperature @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> we found all this to be true even at large @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , according to witten a large @xmath0 mean field theory would find @xmath99 @xcite . while our results agree with this observation at a fixed temperature @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that if @xmath65 is held fixed then @xmath95 approaches a non - zero value in the predicted range showing that the mean field approach again breaks down in the large @xmath0 theory close to the phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the large @xmath0 limit may not always be able to suppress infrared fluctuations close to second order phase transitions . in a sense </S>",
    "<S> this is an indication that the perturbation expansion starting from a mean field solution breaks down . in other words a careful analysis of the ftmft </S>",
    "<S> should be able to reveal this . </S>",
    "<S> this has not yet been done and is a useful project for the future . </S>",
    "<S> it can help us classify the types of large @xmath0 models where mean field theory can break down . </S>"
