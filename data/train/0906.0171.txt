    "even before the pioneer and voyager missions evidence for a global jovian magnetic field had been obtained through the observations of decametric radio waves by @xcite .",
    "the subsequent discoveries of the magnetic fields of saturn , uranus and neptune have been highlights of the exploration of the solar system by space probes .",
    "while jupiter and saturn possess magnetic fields which are dominated by a dipole part that is nearly aligned with the axis of planetary rotation , uranus and neptune exhibit magnetic fields that do not show such an alignment and are also characterized by a strong quadrupolar component .",
    "this latter property has been interpreted in earlier papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) as a result of the thin shell to which the dynamo process is assumed to be confined .",
    "this explanation is not entirely convincing , however , since @xcite argue convincingly that the dynamo process in jupiter and saturn is also confined to thin fluid shells .",
    "as will be pointed out in section 5 magnetic fields without a dominant axis - aligned dipole are a rather common feature of numerical simulations of planetary dynamos .    in the following we",
    "shall first briefly introduce the mathematical background for numerical dynamo simulations . at the present stage it appears to be appropriate to introduce only a minimum of physical parameters in order to obtain an overview of the parameter dependence of planetary dynamos .",
    "hence we shall not even consider the compressibility of the fluid in the giant planets and restrict the analysis to the boussinesq approximation .",
    "an alternative approach has been used by @xcite ( see also article by glatzmaier in these proceedings ) where a fairly accurate representation of the compressibility of jupiter has been attempted .",
    "for the equations describing convection driven dynamos in the frame rotating with the angular velocity @xmath0 we use a standard formulation which has also been used for a dynamo benchmark ( @xcite )",
    ". a more general static state will be assumed with the temperature distribution @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the ratio of inner to outer radius of the spherical shell and @xmath3 is its thickness .",
    "@xmath4 is the temperature difference between the boundaries in the special case @xmath5 . in the case",
    "@xmath6 the static temperature distribution @xmath7 corresponds to that of a homogeneously heated sphere with the heat source density proportional to the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the gravity field is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the position vector with respect to the center of the sphere and @xmath11 is its length measured in units of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to @xmath3 , the time @xmath12 , the temperature @xmath13 and the magnetic flux density @xmath14 are used as scales for the dimensionless description of the problem where @xmath15 denotes the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath16 its thermal diffusivity , @xmath17 its density and @xmath18 its magnetic permeability .",
    "the boussinesq approximation is used in that @xmath17 is assumed to be constant except in the gravity term where its temperature dependence given by @xmath19 const .",
    "is taken into account .",
    "the dimensionless equations of motion , the heat equation for the deviation @xmath20 of the temperature field from the static distribution and the equation of magnetic induction thus assume the form @xmath21",

    "the rayleigh numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the coriolis parameter @xmath29 , the prandtl number @xmath30 and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath31 are defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a typical value of the magnetic diffusivity @xmath34 which we allow to vary as a function of the distance @xmath11 from the center in contrast to the other material properties .",
    "such a variation reflects the often significant variation of the electrical conductivity @xmath35 with radius according to the relationship @xmath36 . while @xmath37 is often assumed with the argument that all effective diffusivities are equal in turbulent media we keep @xmath30 as a parameter .",
    "since the velocity field @xmath38 as well as the magnetic flux density @xmath39 are solenoidal vector fields , the general representation in terms of poloidal and toroidal components can be used , @xmath40 by multiplying the ( curl)@xmath41 and the curl of equation ( 6a ) by @xmath10 we can obtain two equations for @xmath42 and @xmath43 which will not be given here explicitly ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the equations for @xmath44 and @xmath45 are obtained through the multiplication of equation ( 2.4 ) and of its curl by @xmath10 , @xmath46\\nabla^2 l_2 h = p_m [ \\partial_t l_2 h - { { \\bf r } } \\cdot \\nabla \\times ( { { \\bf v } } \\times { { \\bf b } } ) ] \\ ] ] @xmath46\\nabla^2 l_2 g + 2(1-a)r^{-1}\\partial_r(rg ) = p_m [ \\partial_t l_2 g - { { \\bf r } } \\cdot \\nabla \\times ( \\nabla \\times ( { { \\bf v } } \\times { { \\bf b } } ) ) ] \\ ] ] where the @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 in ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) a linear dependence @xmath49 $ ] has been introduced such that @xmath50 at the middle of the layer , @xmath51 .",
    "either rigid boundaries with fixed temperatures as in the benchmark case ( @xcite ) , @xmath52 or stress - free boundaries with fixed temperatures , @xmath53 are frequently used .",
    "the latter conditions allow to cover numerically a larger region of the parameter space since the thin ekman layers at the boundaries are nearly absent .",
    "the radius ratio @xmath54 is often used in the simulations since it provides a good compromise for the study of both , the regions inside and outside the tangent cylinder .",
    "the latter is the virtual cylindrical surface touching the inner spherical boundary at its equator . for the magnetic field it is convenient to employ electrically insulating boundaries such that the toroidal component of the field vanishes there ,",
    "while the poloidal function @xmath44 must be matched to the function @xmath55 which describes the potential fields outside the fluid shell , @xmath56 alternatively an infinitely conducting inner boundary can be assumed , @xmath57 but computations for the case of an inner boundary with no - slip conditions and an electrical conductivity equal to that of the fluid are also often done .",
    "the numerical integration of equations ( 2.3 ) , ( 2.7 ) , ( 2.8 ) , ( 2.9 ) and ( 2.10 ) together with boundary conditions proceeds most often with the pseudo - spectral method as described by @xcite and @xcite which is based on an expansion of all dependent variables in spherical harmonics for the @xmath58-dependences , i.e. @xmath59 and analogous expressions for the other variables , @xmath60 and @xmath45 .",

    "the @xmath11-dependence expansions in chebychev polynomials are used .",
    "it should be emphasized that the static state @xmath62 represents a solution of equations ( 6 ) for all values of the rayleigh numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but this solution is unstable except for low or negative values of the latter parameters .",
    "similarly , there exist solutions with @xmath63 , but @xmath64 , for sufficiently large values of either @xmath27 or @xmath28 or both , but , again , these solutions are unstable for sufficiently large values of @xmath31 with respect to disturbances with @xmath65 .",
    "dynamo solutions , as all solutions with @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 are called , are thus removed by at least two bifurcations from the basic static solution of the problem .",
    "past research on convection driven dynamos in rotating , self - gravitating spherical shells has shown that the properties of convection in the absence of a magnetic field do change quantitatively , but not qualitatively after the lorentz force enters the force balance .",
    "it is thus important to understand the properties of non - magnetic convection .",
    "a rough idea of the dependence of the critical rayleigh number @xmath68 for the onset of convection on the parameters of the problem can be gained from the expressions derived from the annulus model ( see recent review of @xcite )    r_c = 3 ( ) ^ ( _ m)^ r_m^- 2 ^ - , + m_c = ( ) ^ ( r_m _ m ) ^ 2 ^ - , _",

    "the azimuthal wavenumber of the preferred mode is denoted by @xmath74 and the corresponding angular velocity of the drift of the convection columns in the prograde direction is given by @xmath75 .",
    "while expressions ( 3.1 ) correspond to motions in the form of columns aligned with the axis of rotation , convection in the form of  banana cells \" is realized in less rapidly rotating or thinner spherical shells as experimentally visualized in figure 1 .",
    "an analytical theory of the  banana cells \" which includes the differential rotation generated by their reynolds stresses was first derived by @xcite . at low prandtl numbers , namely for @xmath76 inertial convection in the form of equatorially attached cells",
    "becomes prevalent ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "its name reflects the fact that it can be described as a small modification of certain inertial waves ( @xcite ; @xcite ) a third form of convection is realized in the polar regions of the shell which are defined as the two fluid domains inside the tangent cylinder . since gravity and rotation vectors are nearly parallel in these regions ( unless @xmath77 assumes a value close to unity ) convection resembles the kind realized in a horizontal layer heated from below and rotating about a vertical axis . because the coriolis force can not largely be balanced by the pressure gradient in this case",

    ", height=240 ]    more important than its influence on the onset of convection according to relationships ( 3.1 ) is the effect of the prandtl number on convection at finite amplitudes .",
    "typical features of low and high prandtl number convection are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the columnar nature of convection does not vary much with @xmath30 as is evident from the two plots on the left side of the figure . at prandtl numbers of the order unity or less , - but not in the case of inertial convection-",
    ", the convection columns tend to spiral away from the axis and thereby create a reynolds stress which drives a strong geostrophic differential rotation as shown on the right side of the figure .",
    "this differential rotation in turn promotes the spiral tilt and a feedback loop is thus created . at high values of @xmath30",
    "the reynolds stress becomes negligible and no significant mean tilt of the convection columns is apparent in the middle plot of the lower row . in this case",
    "the differential rotation is generated as a thermal wind caused by the latitudinal gradient of the axisymmetric component of @xmath20 .     for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( implying @xmath93 ) and values of @xmath31 as indicated in the boxes .",

    "p = ( r ) ^2 , _ t = r ^2 ,    where the angular brackets indicate the average over the fluid shell and @xmath97 refers to the azimuthally averaged component of @xmath42 , while @xmath98 is defined by @xmath99 .",
    "analogous definitions hold for the magnetic energy densities where @xmath100 etc .",
    "are replaced by @xmath101 etc .",
    ", in figure 3 energy densities have been plotted for convection with and without magnetic fields .",
    "dynamos are generated by convection in rotating spherical shells for all parameter values as long as the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath102 is of the order @xmath103 or higher and the fluid is not too turbulent where the kinetic energy density @xmath104 is defined by @xmath105 . in planetary cores",
    "@xmath31 assumes values of the order of @xmath106 and less , but numerical simulation have achieved so far only values somewhat below @xmath107 .",
    "an important feature demonstrated in figure 3 is the change in the structure of the magnetic field with increasing prandtl number . while for low values of @xmath30 the mean poloidal field is small in comparison with the fluctuating components , this situation reverses as @xmath30 increase .",
    "this change is associated with the transition from the geostrophic differential rotation to the thermal wind type differential rotation caused by a latitudinal temperature gradient .",
    "while the magnetic energy @xmath96 may exceed the total kinetic energy @xmath104 by orders of magnitude in particular for high prandtl numbers , ohmic dissipation is usually found to be roughly comparable to viscous dissipation or less in numerical simulations .",
    "this may be due to the limited numerically accessible parameter space , however .    ,",

    "exhibit a dipolar or a quadrupolar character unless the non - axissymmetric components by far exceed the axisymmetric components of the field as sometimes happens for high values of @xmath113 or low values of @xmath30 .",
    "in addition dynamos of hemispherical character are often found , for which the field in the northern half is much weaker than in the southern half or vice versa .",
    "quadrupolar and hemispherical dynamos typically oscillate .",
    "dipolar dynamos often oscillate as well , but sometimes these oscillations can not be identified at a distance of a radius or more as is evident in the example of figure 4 .",
    "it is obvious from the preceding sections that numerical simulations are still far removed from realistic descriptions of dynamo processes in the giant planets .",
    "there are even more basic issues that need to be resolved .",
    "since the proudman - taylor - theorem holds for barotropic fluids the strong differential rotations observed at the surface of the planets must be expected to continue for a considerable distance into the planetary interiors . because the poloidal electric current density will be of the order @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a typical zonal velocity , say @xmath116 , and @xmath117 measures the strength of the poloidal field the density of ohmic dissipation becomes of the order @xmath118 .",
    "when this expression is integrated over a reasonable domain inside the planet it turns out ( @xcite ) that it exceeds easily the net luminosity of jupiter as well as that of saturn when the value of @xmath35 for metallic hydrogen is used . accordingly",
    "@xcite argue that the dynamo is located in a region where not only the strong zonal flows penetrating from the surface have been truncated , but where also @xmath35 is as small as is compatible with a magnetic reynolds number of the order of a few @xmath119 .",
    "such a region would lie at a depth of less than @xmath120 @xmath121 of the planetary radius of jupiter ( saturn ) where hydrogen is still a semiconductor ( @xcite ) .",
    "a consequence of the latter property is a strong temperature dependence of @xmath35 which translates into a high radial increase of @xmath34 .",
    "it will be of interest to see how these properties and constraints can be accommodated in dynamo simulations producing magnetic fields similar to the observed ones .",
    "the dynamos operating in uranus and neptune are similarly constrained ( @xcite ) .",
    "traditionally an ionic electrical conductivity has been assumed for the dynamo regions of these planets , but recent measurements ( @xcite ) indicate that water is semiconducting under the relevant conditions .",
    "( left ) and @xmath122 ( right ) .",
    "the values @xmath123 , @xmath91 and @xmath124 are the same in both cases .",
    "the plots show lines of constant @xmath125 on the surface @xmath126 ( upper row ) and @xmath127 ( lower row),height=192 ]      we close with some remarks on the unusual form of the magnetic fields of uranus and neptune .",
    "the properties that dipole components of the magnetic fields are relatively weak in comparison with other components and that the dipoles are not aligned with the axes of rotation are not especially unusual .",
    "magnetic fields of such character can often be found in simulations of convection driven dynamos .",
    "it seems that they are more often found when the diffusivity varies with radius . in figure 6",
    "some typical examples are shown which seem to resemble the observed magnetic fields of the icy planets ."
