    "@xmath8 is the luminosity of the star and @xmath9 is the maximal or eddington luminosity of the same .",
    "it is also seen that @xmath10 increase with @xmath1 and saturates to a maximal value of @xmath11 .",

    "the chemical composition and @xmath15 is solar mass ( @xcite ) . in order to have a `` radiation pressure supported star ''",
    ", one must have @xmath16 .",
    "then the above equation demands that @xmath17 .",
    "such stars are known as ( newtonian ) supermassive stars . but this picture changes dramatically when we allow for the likely occurrence of extreme relativistic situations with @xmath18 when ( @xcite ) @xmath19 because of the presence of @xmath1 on the rhs , now a radiation supported quasistatic state ( @xmath16 ) can occur for arbitrary value of @xmath20 .",
    "for instance an object with @xmath21 with a value of @xmath22 will have @xmath16 and on the other hand , a fireball of energy 1 tev created by two colliding elementary particles in a lab collider with @xmath23 could attain a radiation dominated quasistatic state with @xmath24 ! in both the cases , the radius of the object would be practically same as those of corresponding ( supposed ) bhs .",
    "such a large value of @xmath1 may sound unphysical .",
    "but , actually , it is not so because continued collapse is supposed to proceed to a true bh state with @xmath25 and all finite numbers including @xmath26 are _ infinitely smaller than _ @xmath27 .",
    "it has been also shown that , as physical gravitational collapse must be radiative ( @xcite ) and @xmath1 keeps on increasing relentlessly during continued collapse , the quanta of collapse generated radiation quanta must eventually move in _ almost _ closed circular orbits and be quasitrapped even before an _",
    "absolute _ trapping would occur by the formation of trapped surfaces or event horizon ( eh ) .",
    "it is this quasitrapping of radiation which causes @xmath16 and also @xmath28 .",
    "since such states correspond to @xmath11 , ecos are formed much before a true bh state ( @xmath25 ) would be formed . since the life time of this relativistic radiation dominated state is @xmath29 yr and @xmath30 as @xmath31 ecos are _ eternally collapsing _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "as the ecos evolve , their eos @xmath32 and the gravitational mass @xmath33 where @xmath34 is proper volume element ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the eventual bh mass @xmath2 and thus the observed bhs with @xmath35 , either discussed in this conferences or elsewhere , can not be true bhs and must be ecos .",
    "this conclusion that true bhs have @xmath36 has been also obtained by using the basic differential geometry property that proper spacetime 4-volume is coordinate independent ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and non - occurrence of trapped surfaces and eh ( @xcite , @xcite ) . since astrophysical plasama is endowed with intrinsic magnetic field the super compact ecos must have strong intrinsic magnetic fields and hence they are also called magnetospheric ecos or mecos .",
    "in contrast a true uncharged bh with an eh has no intrinsic magnetic field .",
    "thus mecos can be observationally distinguished from true bhs by using this physical property .",
    "and there are strong circumstantial evidences that the bh candidates in ( i ) x - ray binaries ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or the ( ii ) the compact object at the galactic centre ( @xcite ) are mecos with physical surfaces rather than any eh . most importantly , detailed microlensing aided mapping of the central engine of the one of the most well studied quasar has directly revealed that it is a meco and not a bh ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed magnetic field of mecos will however be smaller by a factor of ( @xmath37 ) and could be well below pulsar values .",
    "because of joint effect of gravitational redshift and time dilatation , the observed luminosity of the ecos would be also also extremely small , @xmath38 erg / s even though they are shinging at thir respective eddington values .",
    "this feeble quiesent eco quiesent radiation could be in the microwave range and is yet to be detected for any individual case .",
    "since eco formation is a generic effect due to inevitable quasi - trapping of collapse generated radiation , continued collapse can not give rise to any mysterious phase transition resulting in negative pressure or `` gravstars '' .",
    "since chandrasekhar mass limit pertains to _ cold _ objects , it is irrelevant for _ hot _ ecos whose local mean temperature is @xmath39 mev .",
