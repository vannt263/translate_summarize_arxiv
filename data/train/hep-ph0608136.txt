    "while the phase transition from hadronic degrees of freedom to partonic degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions is a central focus of recent experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , data on baryon and hyperon production has revealed interesting and unexpected features that may be of novel dynamical origin . as an example , a _ baryon / meson anomaly _",
    "@xcite is observed as a large enhancement of the baryon to meson ratio and as a large difference of the nuclear modification factor ( nmf ) between total charged @xcite and neutral pions ( @xmath6 ) @xcite at moderate ( intermediate ) transverse momenta ( @xmath7 gev/_c _ ) .    in previous papers",
    "@xcite we studied the possible role of topological baryon junctions , @xcite , and the effects of strong color field ( scf ) @xcite in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "we have shown , in the framework of hijing / bb v2.0 model , that junction - antijunction ( @xmath8 ) loops with an enhanced _ intrinsic transverse momentum _ @xmath9 1 gev/_c _ , a default string tension @xmath10 = 1 gev / fm , and a diquark suppression factor ( @xmath11=0.07 ) provide a partial explanation of the baryon / meson anomaly @xcite .",
    "that model provides an alternative dynamical explanation of the data to recombination models @xcite . within hijing / bb v2.0 @xcite",
    "one of the main assumptions is that strings could survive and fragment @xcite , and in particular populate the mid to low @xmath12 range .",
    "in contrast , in the recombination picture @xcite or in the hydrodynamical approach @xcite all coherent strings are assumed to become rapidly incoherent resulting in a rapid thermalization .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions the color charge excitations",
    "may be considerably greater than in nucleon - nucleon collisions due to the almost simultaneous interaction of several participating nucleons in a row @xcite and could be important even in the case of few binary collisions .",
    "molecular dynamics models have been used to study the effects of color ropes as an effective description of the non - perturbative , soft gluonic part of qcd @xcite .",
    "recently , the effects of gluon field generated in the wake of hard processes and through primordial fluctuations of the color charges in the nuclei have been investigated@xcite .",
    "the physical situation immediately after the collision bears close analogy to string models of high energy collisions .",
    "it was shown that the initial electric and magnetic fields produced in high energy hadronic collisions are longitudinal and leads to a novel string - like description of the collisions and a large topological charge density after the collisions @xcite . in our model ,",
    "hijing / bb v2.0 , there are longitudinal electric fields induced by a collision , which subsequently decay by quantum pair production .",
    "the effects of longitudinal magnetic fields are taken into account by a specific ( like _ mercedes star _ )",
    "topology for junction anti - junction @xmath8 loops @xcite .",
    "strangeness enhancement @xcite , strong baryon transport @xcite , and increase of intrinsic @xmath13 @xcite are all expected consequences of scf .",
    "these are modeled in our microscopic models as an increase of the effective string tension that controls the quark - anti - quark ( _ q_@xmath14 ) and diquark - anti - diquark ( qq@xmath15 ) pair creation rates and the strangeness suppression factors @xcite .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite we have focused on longitudinal rapidity distributions and transverse mass ( or momentum ) spectra of hadrons and hyperons in au+au collisions at rhic energies",
    ". however , the benchmark test of microscopic models are _",
    "p_+_p _ and _ p_(_d_)+_a _ data . the results from _ p_+_p _ collisions are used as a base line reference to obtain nuclear modification factor _ r_@xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we explore further dynamical effects associated with long range coherent fields ( i.e strong color fields , scf ) , including baryon junctions @xcite and loops @xcite , in the framework of hijing / bb v2.0 @xcite , with emphasis on the novel baryon and hyperon observables measured at rhic in _ p_+_p _ and _ d_+au collisions . using this model",

    "ii we review the hijing / bb v2.0 ( with scf ) model . for clarity , we repeat here some of the basics out - line that has been already presented in refs .  @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss theoretical predictions in comparison with recent rhic experimental data .",
    "finally summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "hijing is a model that provides a theoretical framework to extrapolate elementary proton - proton multiparticle phenomena to complex nuclear collisions as well as to explore possible new physics such as energy loss and gluon shadowing @xcite .",
    "our analysis are performed in the framework of the hijing / bb v2.0 model that is based on hijing / bb v1.10 @xcite , @xcite and hijing @xcite .    in hijing @xcite the soft beam jet fragmentation",
    "is modeled by diquark - quark strings as in @xcite with gluon kinks induced by soft gluon radiations .",
    "the mini - jet physics is computed via an eikonal multiple collision framework using pqcd pythia 7.3 to compute the initial and final state radiation and hard scattering rates . in pythia",
    "the cross section for hard parton scatterings is enhanced by a factor _ k _ = 2 in order to simulate high order corrections .",
    "hijing extends pythia to include a number of new nuclear effects .",
    "besides the glauber nuclear eikonal extension , shadowing of nuclear parton distributions is modeled .",
    "in addition dynamical energy loss of the ( mini)jets is taken into account through an effective energy loss , @xmath18 @xcite .    in hijing / bb v1.10 @xcite the baryon junction mechanism was introduced as an extension of hijing / b @xcite in order to try to account for the observed longitudinal distributions of baryons(_b _ ) and anti - baryons(@xmath19 ) in proton nucleus ( _ p_+_a _ ) and nucleus - nucleus ( _ a_+_a _ ) collisions at the sps energies . however , as implemented in hijing / bb v1.10 the junction loops fails to account for the observed enhanced transverse slope of anti - baryons spectra at moderate @xmath12 in _ a_+_a _ @xcite .",
    "this is due to limitations of the @xmath12 algorithm adopted in version 1.10 that includes kinematic constraints that worked to oppose the predicted enhancement in the baryon junction loop @xcite . in hijing",
    "/ bb v2.0 we replaced that algorithm with one that implements @xmath8 loops @xmath12 enhancement directly .",
    "this is done by specifying the intrinsic ( anti)diquark @xmath12 kick in any standard diquark - quark string ( qq-_q _ ) that contains one or multiple @xmath8 loops .",
    "in addition , we introduced a new formula ( see eq.(1 ) below ) for generating the probability that a given diquark or anti - diquark gets an _ `` enhanced @xmath12 kick '' _ from the underlying junction mechanism .",
    "we emphasize that while there is very strong evidence from a variety of data that the source of the observed baryon @xmath12 enhancement arises more naturally from collective hydrodynamic flow @xcite , elliptic flow of heavy hyperons @xcite argues strongly for a dominant partonic collective flow as the origin of the baryon anomaly .",
    "most of the initial baryon radial @xmath12 could theoretically arise from the production mechanism , while its elliptic deformation would arise from final state interactions .",
    "nevertheless , our purpose here is to explore more fully without the kinematic limitations of version 1.10 , the theoretical problem of how much of the baryon anomaly could be due to the postulated baryon junction dynamics @xcite at rhic energies and how well is described ( _ p_)_d_+au collisions with emphasis on strangeness production .",
    "the details of this new implementation of @xmath8 loops are described below .",
    "multiple hard and soft interactions proceed as in hijing . before fragmentation",
    ", we compute via jetset @xcite the probability that a junction loop occurs in the string .",
    "a picture of a juction loop is as follows : a color flux line splits at some intermediate point into two flux lines at one junction and then the flux lines fuse back into one at a second anti - junction somewhere further along the original flux line . the distance in rapidity between these points",
    "is chosen via a regge distribution as described below .",
    "for single inclusive baryon observables this distribution does not need to be specified .",
    "the probability of such a loop is assumed to increase with the number of binary interactions , n@xmath20 , that the incident baryon suffers in passing through the oncoming nucleus .",
    "this number depends on the relative and absolute impact parameters and is computed in hijing using the eikonal path through a diffuse nuclear density .",
    "we assume that out of the non single diffractive _",
    "n__n _ interaction cross section , @xmath21=@xmath22 , a fraction of events @xmath23 excite a junction loop ( where @xmath24 is single diffractive cross sections ) .",
    "the probability after @xmath25 that the incident baryon has a @xmath8 loop is : @xmath26 we take @xmath27=17 mb , @xmath28 10 mb , and @xmath29 42 mb for the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section at nucleon - nucleon ( _ n__n _ ) centre of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy @xmath30=200 gev .",
    "these cross sections imply that at @xmath30=200 gev , a junction loop occurs in _ p_+_p _ collisions with a rather high probability @xmath31 and rapidly approaches 1 in _",
    "a_+_a _ collisions . in",
    "p_+_s _ where @xmath32 there is an 80% probability that a junction loop occurs in this scheme .",
    "thus the effects of loops is taken here to have a very rapid onset and essentially all participant baryons are excited with @xmath8 loops in _",
    "a_+_a _ collisions at rhic . however , the actual probability is modified by string fragmentation due to the threshold cutoff mass @xmath33 gev , which provides sufficient kinematical phase space for @xmath34 pair production .",
    "we investigated the sensitivity of the results to the value of parameters @xmath8 and found no significant variation on pseudo - rapidity distributions of charged particles produced in au+au collisions at @xmath30=200 gev , assuming cross sections @xmath27 , 15 mb @xmath35 25 mb and a cutoff mass @xmath36 , 4 gev @xmath37 6 gev .",
    "light ion reactions such as , _ p_+_a _ or _",
    "d_+au should show more sensitivity to @xmath27 . in hijing / bb v2.0 , we introduced @xcite the possible topology with two junctions @xcite and a new algorithm where @xmath8 loops are modeled by an enhancing diquark @xmath12 kick characterized by a gaussian width of @xmath38 , where _ f _",
    "is a broadening factor , and @xmath39=0.350 gev / c ( consistent with pythia @xcite default value ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we concluded that a value _ f _ = 3 best reproduced the ( anti)proton @xmath12 spectra in au+au collisions at @xmath30=200 gev .",
    "this implementation of the @xmath8 loops mechanism marks a radical departure from that implemented in hijing / bb v1.10 .",
    "while the above procedure allows baryon anti - baryon pairs to acquire much higher transverse momentum in agreement with observation , the absolute production rate also depends on the diquark / quark suppression factor @xmath11 ( see sec .",
    "the factor _",
    "f _ modifying the default value @xmath39=0.350 gev / c may depend on beam energy , atomic mass number ( _ a _ ) , and centrality ( impact parameter ) .",
    "however , we will show that a surprising good description of a variety of observables is obtained with a constant value , _",
    "the sensitivity of the theoretical predictions to this parameter is discussed in sec .",
    "finally , we remark that baryon anti - baryon correlations studies in _ p_+_p _ and _ p_(_d_)+au collisions at rhic energies could eventually help us to obtain more precise values of @xmath8 loops parameters ( mainly : @xmath40 , regge intercept @xmath41 , and parameter _ f _ ) .",
    "phenomenological descriptions are currently based on regge trajectory which gives the appropiate relationship between the mass _ m _ of the hadrons and its spin @xmath42 : @xmath43 , where @xmath41 is the regge intercept , and @xmath44 is the regge slope .",
    "the value of the regge slope for baryons is @xmath45 gev@xmath46 @xcite that yields a string tension ( related to the regge slope , @xmath47 ) @xmath481.0 gev / fm .",
    "the multi - gluon exchange processes dominated by pomeron exchange in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions could be described by a regge trajectory with a smaller slope @xmath49 0.45 gev@xmath50 @xcite , leading to an increase of string tension to @xmath51 .",
    "the contribution to the double differential inclusive cross section for the inclusive production of a baryon and an anti - baryon in nn collisions due to @xmath8 exchange is given by @xcite :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is an unknown function of the transverse momentum and @xmath54 ( junction+pomeron+baryon ) couplings @xcite . the predicted rapidity correlation length ( @xmath55 depends upon the value of the regge",
    "intercept @xmath41 .",
    "a value of @xmath56 @xcite leads to rapidity correlations on the scale @xmath57 , while a value @xmath58 @xcite is associated with infinite range rapidity correlations .",
    "thus , it is important to study rapidity correlations at rhic energies where very high statistics data are now available .      in the case of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )",
    "creation it is necessary to modify the dynamics of particle vacuum production at short time scales and the abundance of newly produced particle may deviate considerably from the values obtained assuming a constant field @xcite .",
    "two possible processes that lead to an increase of strangeness production within the framework of the schwinger mechanism are : i ) an increase in the field strength by a modified string tension @xmath59 @xcite , or ii ) a drop in the quark masses due to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite .",

    "recently , non - perturbative gluon and quark - antiquark pair production from a constant chromoelectric field with arbitrary color index via vacuum polarization have been also investigated in a qcd formalism @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath12 dependence of the rate of production is different because of the presence of the nontrivial color generators in qcd , the integration over @xmath12 , reproduced also schwinger s result for total production rate used here to estimate the suppression of heavier flavors .    the real fields emerging in heavy - ion collisions , could be inhomogeneous , with a space - time dependence .",

    "@xcite , and we have to consider a time - dependent homogeneous field . taking a soliton - like field , the production probability for strange quarks is 1.5 times larger than in stationary case @xcite , and therefore , the abundance of newly produced multi - strange particles may considerably deviate from the values obtained for the constant field .    in hijing",
