    "the deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) data are used for extraction of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in nucleon starting from the advent of the bjorken scaling phenomena ( for the most recent studies see refs .",
    "however since new dis data appear permanently and the theoretical basis for their analysis is being developed alongside , those analysis should be updated in order to improve the experimental and theoretical errors on the extracted pdfs . in this paper",
    "we give such update of the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite aimed to extract pdfs , the high - twist ( ht ) contribution to the structure functions @xmath6 , and the value of strong coupling constant @xmath7 from the existing data on dis of charged leptons off the proton and deuterium targets .",
    "one of the improvements of our analysis is replacement of data by the h1 @xcite and the zeus @xcite collaborations by their more recent data @xcite obtained in the 1996 - 97 run of the hera collider , when these experiments accumulated about 5 times more events than before .",
    "another improvement is account of the nnlo qcd corrections , which have been known with a good precision after calculation of the mellin moments of the nnlo splitting functions up to 14-th  @xcite .",
    "this new input significantly decreases the uncertainty of pdfs due to the higher - orders ( ho ) qcd corrections  @xcite and together with more precise data allows to produce the nlo and nnlo pdfs sets with reduced total uncertainty .",
    "the particular features of the analysis @xcite as compared to the global fits of refs.@xcite are :    * data on the differential cross sections are used that allows to use experimental constraints on the structure function @xmath8 ; * corrections for the effects of target mass ( tm ) and for the nuclear effects in deuteron are applied to the data , the both were calculated in the fits iteratively using the current pdfs ; * comprehensive account of the experimental errors and their correlations is performed ; * impact of main sources of the theoretical errors is analyzed .",
    "all these features are also kept in the present analysis .",
    ".the numbers of data points ( ndp ) for separate experiments and the corresponding renormalization shifts @xmath9 obtained in different fits . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : als ]    values of @xmath10 obtained in different orders of pqcd are given in table  [ tab : als ] .",
    "for comparison in the nnlo analysis of the existing data for dis of charged leptons off proton the value of @xmath11 was obtained @xcite .",
    "this value is comparable with our result , but one is to note that , despite the low @xmath12 data were used in the fit , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite was performed with the ht terms fixed at zero .",
    "meanwhile the values of @xmath7 and @xmath13 at large @xmath14 are strongly anti - correlated . from the trial fit with the constraint @xmath15",
    "we obtain the value of @xmath16 , i.e. their value is much larger and their error is much smaller than in the fit with the ht terms fitted . from this comparison we conclude that in fact our result for @xmath7 is in disagreement with the result of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , value of @xmath7 obtained in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite rises from the nlo to the nnlo , in contrast with our results .",
    "our nlo pdfs evolved in the vfn scheme are compared to the recent cteq and mrst parameterizations in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfcomp ] .",
    "the comparison is made at @xmath17 , which is the lowest scale for the hard processes at the hadron colliders . at this scale",
    "we observe the largest deviations of our pdfs from the cteq gluon distribution at large @xmath14 , the mrst gluon distribution at small @xmath14 , and the quark distribution of both groups at small @xmath14 .",
    "the observed differences in particular can be due to the data on drell - yan process and jet production were used in the cteq and mrst analysis . to clarify this point thorough analysis of universality of the pdfs in different processes",
    "is necessary , but any way these differences can have impact on the calculated cross sections of hard processes at the hadron collider , e.g. on the k - factor for the higgs boson production .",
    "the discrepancy with the mrst gluon distribution , which is the lowest of the three considered pdfs sets , is especially important since at small @xmath14 it gets negative at small @xmath12 . at larger @xmath12",
    "the difference between the different pdfs sets is smaller due to focusing properties of the qcd evolution @xcite .",
    "recently the cteq collaboration estimated the errors in their pdfs and we can compare those estimates with the errors in our pdfs",
    ". the comparison can not be completely sensible since due to technical difficulties cteq did not take into account the impact of the normalization errors in data .",
    "indeed , the account of normalization errors essentially increase the point - to - point correlations for many subsets and leads to amplification of the numerical instability of the calculations .",
    "the value of @xmath18 , which is indicator of these correlations ( see sec.[sec : pdfexp ] ) , rises essentially if normalization errors are included into the covariance matrix . in particular , for the bcdms data @xmath18 is 0.68/0.29 with / without normalization errors taken into account .",
    "meanwhile account of the normalization errors leads to increase of the pdfs uncertainties up to factor of 5 ( see fig.[fig : pdfsys ] ) . in the analysis of cteq the value of @xmath19 for some data subsets",
    "deviates off 1 much more than this is statistically allowed .",
    "these fluctuations may be caused by several reasons , including inaccuracies in the model of data , such as inaccount of the ht terms , the target mass corrections , the nuclear corrections , and the ho qcd corrections . to avoid this problem cteq scaled their pdfs errors by the `` tolerance '' factor , which was selected equal to 10 in order to provide comparability of all data subsets .",
    "effectively , the application of such tolerance factor leads to the crude account of all sources of uncertainties , including theoretical ones , since the scaled errors cover the total range of possible variation of the fitted parameters . in our analysis",
    "we need not introduce the tolerance factor since deviations of @xmath19 for separate data subsets off 1 fit to the possible statistical fluctuations ( see table  [ tab : chi ] ) .",
    "the errors in cteq6 pdfs are compared to ours in fig .",
    "[ fig : err ] . for all pdfs ,",
    "excluding the sea quarks distribution at @xmath20 the cteq pdfs errors are larger than ours . the difference is especially pronounced for the gluon and sea distributions at small @xmath14 and for the @xmath21- and @xmath22-quark distributions at large @xmath14 . from this comparison",
    "follows that use of the variety of data for the pdfs extraction not necessarily leads to the decrease of the pdfs errors since improvement in experimental accuracy can be accompanied by the growth of theoretical errors ( at least one is to take care about accurate estimation of the later ) .",
    "the pdfs obtained in our analysis are available through the www pagealekhin / pdfa02/ ] .",
    "we placed in this page the pdfs generated in the lo , nlo , and nnlo ; in the vfn and ffn schemes , including special sets with shifted values of the @xmath23-quark mass and the sea suppression factor to allow account of the corresponding theoretical uncertainties in pdfs .",
    "the pdfs are supplied by the experimental uncertainties , which can be conveniently taken into account in the calculation .",
    "this can be performed both using propagation error formula based on the pdfs derivatives and by generating random pdfs .",
    "the later way is most convenient in the monte - carlo calculations and was adopted in les houches interface for the pdfs with uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 bands for the first mellin moments of the parton distributions at different @xmath25 calculated using this code are given in fig.[fig : pmom ] .",
    "the typical uncertainties in the momentum carried by different species is generally less than 0.01 , being the largest for the gluon distribution .",
    "the experimental errors in typical parton luminosities @xmath26 for the antiproton - proton collisions at @xmath27 ( fermilab collider ) and the proton - proton collisions at @xmath28 ( lhc collider ) are given in fig.[fig : lum ] .",
    "in the kinematical range relevant for the studies of hard processes the relative errors in parton luminosities for the lhc are in the range of @xmath29% ; for the fermilab collider they are comparable with the lhc ones at @xmath30 and are much larger at @xmath31 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath4-boson production cross section due to errors in pdfs is @xmath1% for the both colliders ; for the higgs boson production cross section it is @xmath1% for the lhc and varies from 2% to 10% for the fermilab collider under variation of the higgs boson mass from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the pdfs extracted from the dis data only are precise enough : the estimated uncertainties in the parton luminosities including all sources of experimental errors in data are @xmath32 in the kinematical region feasible at the lhc collider and @xmath33 at the fermilab collider .",
    "the theoretical errors in pdfs are under control and generally do not exceed experimental ones , therefore the dis pdfs can be used for conclusive searches of deviation from the standard model in other processes and/or checks of the universality of pdfs .",
