    "in our previous paper @xcite , we calibrated the peak energy - peak luminosity relation of grbs with 33 nearby events ( @xmath3 ) whose luminosity distances were estimated from those of large amount of sneia @xcite .",
    "this calibrated yonetoku relation , derived without assuming any cosmological models , can be used as a new cosmic distance ladder toward higher redshifts .",
    "then we determined the luminosity distances of 30  grbs in @xmath4 using the calibrated relation and calculated the likelihood varying @xmath5 .",
    "we obtained @xmath6 for a flat universe , which is consistent with the concordance cosmological model within one sigma level .",
    "our logic to obtain a new distance ladder is similar to that for sneia , that is , we calibrate a new distance indicator ( yonetoku relation ) at low redshifts ( @xmath3 ) using the well established indicators ( sneia )",
    ". then we assume the new relation holds at high redshifts ( @xmath7 ) , although more detailed analysis is needed for possible selection bias and evolution effects in the relation @xcite .",
    "currently the number of grbs with @xmath7 is relatively small ( @xmath8 ) and the statistical and systematic errors of the yonetoku relation are not so small compared with sneia .",
    "even then , grbs are still effective to probe dark energy , especially for dynamical dark energy whose energy density becomes large at high redshifts , because the mean redshift of grbs is higher than that of sneia @xcite .",
    "there would be many ways to characterize the time variation of dark energy .",
    "here we adopt a simple phenomenological model as @xcite @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constants and @xmath12 is the scale factor of the universe . for this model , grbs would give strong constraints on @xmath11 which represents the time dependence of dark energy .    in this letter , we present constraints on cosmological parameters such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 using both sneia with @xmath13 and grbs with @xmath14 . in   2",

    "in our previous paper @xcite , we calibrated the yonetoku relation @xcite using 33  events with the redshift @xmath3 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the peak luminosity and the peak energy of the spectrum of a certain grb event in a comoving frame , respectively .",
    "fig . 1 of the previous paper shows",
    "that the linear correlation coefficient of the above relation in logarithmic scale is 0.9478 and the chance probability is @xmath24 .",
    "however the data distribution has a larger deviation around the best fit line compared with the expected gaussian distribution .",
