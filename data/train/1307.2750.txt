    ", the intermediate @xmath11 region of non - zero susceptibility ( above the susceptibility jump ) and no long range order ( below the specific heat anomaly ) was termed `` renormalized classical phase '' .",
    "it was speculated that there a small number of excitations behave as free particles in the two - dimensional magnetic planes .",
    "clearly , no signatures of such a phase are present in our measurements , where the susceptibility jump always coincides with the specific heat divergence",
    ". the cause of the discrepancy can not be unambiguously identified .",
    "however , the almost complete lack of a thermal broadening of @xmath14 curves in ref . may indicate a sample thermalization problem in the pulsed field experiment of stone _",
    "et al_.      the first step in understanding the role of br substitution is to identify its precise influence on the crystal structure of ( c@xmath0h@xmath1n@xmath2)cu@xmath2(cl@xmath4br@xmath5)@xmath3 .",
    "the most obvious effect is a systematic increase of lattice constants and unit cell volume with increasing nominal br content @xmath23 , as shown in fig.[xrd]a , which is based on the results of single crystal x - ray diffraction measurements .",
    "interestingly , the largest effect is on the @xmath24 and @xmath15 lattice constants .",
    "this is consistent with the layered structure of phcc,@xcite where the magnetic ions and superechange - carrying halide ions form well - connected networks in the @xmath25 plane and are loosely stacked along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "our x - ray diffraction data were complete enough to also determine the local cl / br occupancies on each of the three crystallographically inequivalent halogen sites .",
    "the three refined br occupancies are plotted vs. nominal br content in the starting crystal growth solution in fig .",
    "the immediate conclusion is that br ions primarily affect the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor superexchange pathways along the @xmath15 axis of phcc ( fig .",
    "[ xrd]c ) . in the nomenclature of ref .  , it is the exchange constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the actual br insertion rates into the superexchange bonds along that @xmath24 axis are less than half of the nominal .",

    ", the overall trend of increased disorder appears similar to that of finite temperature : the susceptibility jump broadens and moves to higher fields .",
    "the overall upward shift is clearly a consequence of the increase of the spin gap in br - substituted samples.@xcite the broadening , on the other hand , is easy to understand in the framework of bg physics . as discussed in refs .   and references therein",
    ", the appearance of non - zero uniform magnetic susceptibility below the critical field of 3-dimensional ordering is one of the key signatures of the bg .",
    "it represents a finite compressibility of the bosonic matter in the absence of bec . by analogy with previous studies on ( ch@xmath32)@xmath2chnh@xmath32cu(cl@xmath4br@xmath33)@xmath32 , @xcite in our case of phcx ,",
    "this regime is to be associated with the field range where @xmath14 increases steadily from a small value , just below the transition field , i.e. , @xmath34  t.    a more careful look at the data reveals important additional peculiarities .",
    "first , we note that the sharp susceptibility cusp that in the pure sample we identified with 3-dimensional ordering becomes progressively broadened when disorder is introduced in phcx .",
    "this is in contrast to the finite-@xmath35 effect on phcc discussed above , where the kink remains sharp at all temperatures .",
    "a second very interesting feature is that in all disordered samples , at low temperature , we observe additional magnetic susceptibility _ inside _ the gapped phase ( i.e. , below the critical field ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ chiath ] ( circles ) , the zero - field susceptibility increases monotonically with br content .",
    "this contribution is _ not _ due to paramagnetic impurities . indeed , in a magnetic field of 4  t ( triangles )",
    "it remains practically unchanged . at @xmath7  k , under these conditions",
    ", paramagnetic @xmath36 impurities would be already close to saturation , with the susceptibility reduced by a factor of 4 compared to zero field .",
    "we conclude that the observed extra susceptibility below 4  t is of a van vleck character . at still higher fields ,",
    "the trend is reversed in that the susceptibility decreases with increased br concentration ( fig .",
    "[ chiath ] , squares for @xmath37  t ) .",
    "this is clearly due to the contribution of the susceptibility jump at the critical field , which simply moves out to higher field with increased br content .",
    "it appears that the van vleck contribution at lower fields has a different origin , of which we can only speculate about at this stage .",
    "the simplest explanation is that each interstitial br distorts the local ionic environments of the cu@xmath31 ions , affecting the gyromagnetic ratios of nearby cu@xmath31 ions . in this situation ,",
    "applying a uniform magnetic field will result in a non - uniform spin field . while the uniform magnetic susceptibility of an isotropic spin liquid is zero ,",
    "the non - uniform one is not . just as an illustration , consider the toy model of a simple @xmath36 dimer with a singlet - triplet gap @xmath38 , where the gyromagnetic factors @xmath39 and @xmath40 are different for the two spins .",
    "an external uniform magnetic field @xmath41 will induce both a uniform and a staggered component of the spin field , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . at @xmath44 ,",
    "the susceptibility of the antiferromagnetic dimer to the first field is zero since a uniform field conserves total spin .",
    "however , the staggered spin susceptibility is non - zero and equal to @xmath45 . as a result",
    ", the net uniform magnetization will be @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding _ uniform _ magnetic susceptibility will be van vleck like in that it will be temperature and field independent for @xmath47 .",
    "a similar effect will most certainly be present in phcx , even though the exact nature of the spin liquid ground state is not known due to multiple exchange interactions.@xcite this mechanism is due to the local , `` differential '' influence of br ions , so it makes perfect sense that the resulting van vleck term scales roughly linearly with br content .     orientation .",
    "arrows indicate the local susceptibility maxima . ]     at 0 , 4 and 8 t fields , respectively . the solid line is a guide for the eye . ]",
    "one of the main results of this study are measurements of the magnetization of phcx in pulsed magnetic fields , all the way up to the saturation field . for a discussion of the results , it is more useful to focus on the differential susceptibility @xmath48 , derived from the as - measured magnetization curves .",
    "representative data collected at @xmath49  k are shown in fig .",
    "[ hfchi ] .",
    "the result for parent compound are in good qualitative agreement with previous measurements by stone _",
    "et al._.@xcite for all br concentrations , one clearly sees the typical top - hat shape , that spans across the `` compressible '' bec phase .",
    "the inherent noise in the data , primarily due to the small sample sizes , precludes a quantitative analysis . despite that , for all concentrations",
    "it is still possible to roughly determine the upper and lower critical fields in order to establish a phase diagram . for these estimates",
    ", we took the intersection of linearly extrapolated data on either side of each of the two transitions .",
    "the thus obtained critical fields are plotted versus nominal br content in fig .",
    "[ hfchimap ] ( triangles ) , laid over a false color plot of the measured susceptibilities . for comparison",
    ", we also show the critical fields determined from the cusp in ac susceptibility at 2k and from the positions of specific heat anomalies at t=1.5  k.@xcite     orientation.,width=302 ]    the thus obtained field - concentration phase diagram is reminiscent of the field - temperature phase diagram determined in ref .  .",
    "with increasing br concentration the domain of the bec phase shrinks , with the upper and lower critical fields decreasing and increasing , respectively .",
    "this behavior is fully consistent with the previously observed reduction of magnon bandwidth with br substitution.@xcite at least two mechanisms could be liable for this behavior .",
    "first , disorder itself will limit the coherent propagation of quasiparticles and thereby reduce the bandwidth . in its nature , this effect is very similar to the reduction of bandwidth seen in spin liquids at a finite temperature due to magnon - magnon collisions ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is not related to disorder at all , but to the mean `` chemical pressure '' produced by br interstitials .",
    "this pressure is manifested in the expansion of the crystal lattice and in this sense is _ negative _ , and is linear with br concentration ( see fig .",
    "[ xrd ] ) .",
    "direct hydrostatic studies of phcc have demonstrated a linear decrease of the gap energy with applied ( positive ) pressure.@xcite if we interpret the concentration dependence of the critical fields in terms of br - induced chemical pressure , we then naturally explain the linear behavior of the phase boundaries on fig .  [ hfchimap ] .",
    "note that these linear boundaries are the main distinction with the field - temperature phase diagram of the parent compound .",
    "there , both boundaries are curves , roughly corresponding to the bec crossover critical exponent @xmath50.@xcite",
    "we have performed a systematic study of bulk magnetic properties of the gapped quantum magnet phcc and it s chemically disordered derivatives phcx .",
    "contrary to previous reports,@xcite for phcc , our experiments show no evidence of any crossover phase intermediate to spin liquid and long range ordered states . in phcx the ordered phase shrinks roughly linearly with br concentration .",
    "in addition , the transition to the magnetized phase becomes progressively broadened with increased disorder , not inconsistent with expectations for the bg regime .",
    "finally , we detect an additional disorder - induced van vleck like contribution to low - field susceptibility that appears not to be directly related to the field - induced transition .",
