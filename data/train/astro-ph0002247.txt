    "quasars have provided us with a unique probe of the high redshift universe .",
    "these bright point sources shine like a flashlight through space , revealing the presence of baryonic matter through the light it absorbs .",
    "thus every quasar spectrum contains a one - dimensional map of the distribution of matter along the line of sight .",
    "the extraordinary quality of the spectra obtainable with the hires spectrograph on the keck telescope , enables us to extract the wealth of information that has been collected by the quasar s light along its journey through space and time .",
    "computer simulations of structure formation have been remarkably successful in reproducing these observations .",
    "they show that the physics governing the high redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which is responsible for the low column density absorption lines ( the so - called ly@xmath0  forest ) is relatively simple .",
    "the igm , which contains most of the baryons in the universe , is photoionized and photoheated by the collective uv radiation from young stars and quasars . on large scales",
    "its dynamics are determined by the gravitational field of the dark matter , while on small scales gas pressure is important .",
    "the availability of superb data and a detailed physical model , have made the ly@xmath0  forest into a powerful probe of the high - redshift universe .",
    "since shock heating is unimportant in the low - density igm , most of the gas follows a simple temperature - density relation which is the result of the interplay of photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling due to the expansion of the universe . for densities around the cosmic mean ,",
    "this relation is well - described by a power - law , @xmath3 ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) . at reionization",
    "the gas is reheated , resulting in an increase in @xmath4 and a decrease in @xmath5 ( provided that the gas is reionized on a timescale short compared to the hubble time ) . in ionization equilibrium",
    ", @xmath4 decreases and the slope of the effective equation of state steepens ( i.e.  @xmath5 increases ) .",
    "however , because the timescale for recombination is long , the gas retains some memory of how and when it was reionized ( miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) .",
    "the distribution of line widths ( @xmath6-parameters ) depends on various mechanisms .",
    "thermal motions of the hydrogen atoms broaden the hi  absorption lines and other processes , such as the differential hubble flow across the absorbing structure and bulk flows , also contribute to the line widths .",
    "however , the minimum line width is set by the temperature of the gas , which in turn depends on the density . a standard way of analyzing ly@xmath0  forest spectra is by decomposing them into a set of voigt profiles . since the minimum line width ( @xmath6-parameter ) depends on the temperature , and",
    "since column density ( @xmath7 ) correlates strongly with physical density , there is a cut - off in the @xmath8 distribution which traces the effective equation of state of the igm ( schaye et al .",
    "1999 ; ricotti , gnedin & shull 2000 ; bryan & machacek 2000 ) .",
    "we have used this relation to measure the thermal evolution of the igm from a set of nine ly@xmath0  quasar absorption line spectra .",
    "this work is more fully described and discussed in a forthcoming publication ( schaye et al .",
    "we have measured the @xmath8 cut - off for a set of nine high - quality ly@xmath0  forest spectra , spanning the redshift range 2.04.5 , eight of which were taken with the hires spectrograph of the keck telescope .",
    "we used hydrodynamic simulations to calibrate the relations between the @xmath8 cut - off and the temperature - density relation . except for the two lowest redshift quasars ,",
    "the ly@xmath0  forest spectra were split in two in order to take into account the significant redshift evolution ( @xmath9 ) and signal - to - noise variation across a single spectrum .",
    "the calibration was done separately for each half of each observed spectrum .",
    "the synthetic spectra were processed to give them identical characteristics ( resolution , pixel size , noise properties , mean absorption ) as the real data .",
    "the same voigt profile fitting package ( an automated version of vpfit ( webb 1987 ) ) was used for both the simulated and the observed spectra .",
    "the measured evolution of the temperature at the mean density and the slope of the effective equation of state are plotted in figure  1 . from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , @xmath4 increases and the gas becomes close to isothermal ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this behavior differs drastically from that predicted by models in which helium is fully reionized at higher redshift .",
    "for example , the solid lines correspond to a simulation that uses a uniform metagalactic uv - background from quasars as computed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) and which assumes the gas to be optically thin . in this simulation , both hydrogen and helium are fully reionized by @xmath13 and the temperature of the igm declines slowly as the universe expands .",
    "such a model can clearly not account for the peak in the temperature at @xmath2 ( reduced @xmath14 for the solid curves are 6.9 for @xmath4 and 3.6 for @xmath5 ) .",
    "instead , we associate the peak in @xmath4 and the low value of @xmath5 with reheating due to the second reionization of helium ( heii  @xmath15 heiii ) .",
    "this interpretation is supported by measurements of the siiv / civ  ratio ( songaila 1998 , but see also boksenberg , rauch , & sargent 1998 and giroux & shull 1997 ) and direct measurements of the heii  opacity ( heap et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  1 are for a model that was designed to fit the data ( reduced @xmath14 is 0.24 for @xmath4 and 1.38 for @xmath5 ) . in this simulation , which has a much softer uv - background at high redshift",
    ", heii  reionizes at @xmath16 . before reionization , when the gas is optically thick to ionizing photons , the mean energy per photoionization is much higher than in the optically thin limit ( abel & haehnelt 1999 ) .",
    "we have approximated this effect in this simulation by enhancing the photoheating rates during reionization , so raising the temperature of the igm .",
    "since the simulation assumes a uniform ionizing background , the temperature has to increase abruptly ( i.e.  much faster than the gas can recombine ) in order to make @xmath5 as small as observed . in reality",
    ", the low - density gas may be reionized by harder photons , which will be the first ionizing photons to escape from the dense regions surrounding the sources .",
    "this would lead to a larger temperature increase in the more dilute , cooler regions , resulting in a decrease of @xmath5 even for a more gradual reionization .",
    "furthermore , although reionization may proceed fast locally ( as in our small simulation box ) , it may be patchy and take some time to complete . hence the steep temperature jump indicated by the dashed line , although compatible with the data , should be regarded as illustrative only .",
    "the globally averaged @xmath4 could well increase more gradually which would also be consistent with the data .",
    "more data at @xmath17 is needed to determine whether the temperature rise is sharp or gradual . on the theoretical side",
    ", more realistic models should include radiative transfer effects , which are important during reionization .    together with measurements of the heii  opacity , which probe the ionization state in the voids , the thermal history of the igm provides important constraints on models of helium reionization .",
    "furthermore , the temperature of the igm before the onset of helium reionization can be used to constrain the redshift of hydrogen reionization , which marks the end of the dark ages of cosmic history .",
