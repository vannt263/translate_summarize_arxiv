    "the isotropic model ( @xmath11 ) has direct applications to compounds like sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 where copper - oxygen chains form along one crystal axis and the coupling between these chains is very weak making them effectively one dimensional .",

    "however , the calculation of correlation function by ba is a difficult task and only limited results have been obtained so far . on the other hand , it is known that the low - energy effective theory for the hamiltonian ( [ xxz ] ) is just a free boson model .",
