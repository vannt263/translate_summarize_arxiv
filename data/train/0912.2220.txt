    "the yield of binary events in the full momentum transfer reactions with massive nuclei ( @xmath0 ) at the near coulomb barrier energies is the dominant process in comparison with the formation of the evaporation residues . at synthesis of superheavy elements in the hot fusion reactions with massive nuclei",
    "the authors try to choose pair of projectile - target and beam energy to reach the maximum yield of evaporation residues because the observed cross sections are about or less than 1 pb ( 10@xmath1 @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "a formation of the compound nucleus ( cn ) is the necessary condition leading to yield of evaporation residues in competition with fission .",
    "therefore , there is a necessity to estimate as possible the correct value of the complete fusion cross section . because if there is no cn we can not observe an evaporation residue too .",
    "so , if we have the heated and rotating cn as a result of the complete fusion , the possibility to observe the evaporation residues depends on the competition between cooling by emission neutrons , protons , @xmath3-quanta or charged particles and fission of cn . in the dinuclear system ( dns )",
    "concept @xcite the evaporation residue cross section at collision energy @xmath4 is factorized as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the partial cross section of capture of the projectile by the target nucleus ; @xmath7 is the strength of hindrance to formation of cn at stage of competition between complete fusion and quasifission ; @xmath8 is the survival probability of the heated and rotating nucleus at formation of the evaporation residue ; @xmath9 is the value of angular momentum at which the fission barrier of the corresponding cn disappears : @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath12 by increasing the excitation energy is determined by the increase of number of competition cascades between fission and emission of particles .",
    "the synthesis of superheavy elements with @xmath13 may be realized in the  hot fusion \" reactions at excitation energies of cn @xmath14 mev which take place in collisions of relatively light nuclei ( for example , @xmath15ca ) on transactinide targets ( u , am , pu , cm , bk and cf ) . in this kind of reactions the number of formed compound nuclei are much larger than in  cold fusion \" reactions ( @xmath16 mev ) where the total number of compound nuclei is small due to the strong hindrance to complete fusion caused by quasifission .",
    "but the probability of the evaporation residue formation @xmath12 is large because of small values of @xmath17 .",
    "the very hard experiment to synthesis of the superheavy element @xmath18 in the @xmath19zn+@xmath20bi reaction have shown that the use of  cold fusion \" reactions exhausted its potentialities @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( california , usa ) @xcite and gsi ( darmstadt , germany ) @xcite the experiments with  hot fusion \" reactions are performed as in the flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions ( dubna , russia ) @xcite .",
    "the study of the  cold fusion \" mechanism was relatively easy because the target - nuclei were nearly spherical and the number of open channels is small .",
    "the number of partial waves contributing to complete fusion was not large because of small size of the potential well @xcite in the interaction potential for the more symmetric system .",
    "the entrance channel of the  hot fusion \" reactions is mass asymmetric .",
    "therefore , the size of the potential well in nucleus - nucleus interaction is larger in comparison with the one in case  cold fusion \" .",
    "consequently , the large number of partial waves can contribute to capture and complete fusion processes .",
    "consequently , the large lifetime of dns at small excitation energies and the population of the large angular momentum can allow dns to rotate on more large angles . as a result the angular distribution of quasifission products can be even isotropic .",
    "this means that if the mass distribution of quasifission products formed at decay of dns rotating on large angles could reach mass symmetric region , then they are confused with the products of the fusion - fission reactions . in this case",
    "we have ambiguity in determination of the complete fusion cross section from the measured fission products .",
    "the actinides used in ",
    "hot fusion \" reactions are deformed nuclei and the role of the orientation angle of their symmetry axis should be taken into account in study of the reaction mechanism @xcite .",
    "the method of the calculation of quasifission contribution to the fissionlike allows us to separate pure fusion cross section from the measured cross section of the fissionlike product yields .",
    "our calculations showed that the partial cross section of quasifission component of the binary fragments are distributed in the whole range of the angular momentum values leading to capture @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is maximal value of @xmath23 leading to full momentum transfer ( capture ) reaction ( see fig .",
    "[ difspin ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is different from the assumption that quasifission occurs in the range @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the upper limit of angular momentum leading to complete fusion @xcite .",
    "the calculated angular momentum distributions for the compound nucleus and dinuclear system going to quasifission may overlap : competition between complete fusion and quasifission takes place at all values of initial orbital angular momentum .",
    "the method based on the assumption that quasifission component is associated only with the highest partial waves can lead to incorrect quantitative results for the fusion - fission cross section and anisotropy in the angular distribution of the fusion - fission fragments . as a result",
    "the analysis of the observed angular anisotropy of products by the transition saddle point model may be ambiguous if the contribution of the quasifission in the measured data for the fissionlike fragments is large .",
    "this means that some part of the quasifission fragments are considered as the fusion - fission fragments , consequently , the fusion cross section is overestimated at analysis of the experimental data .",
    "the experimental and theoretical studies showed the mass distribution of the quasifission fragments has local maximums around magic numbers of protons @xmath26=20 , 28 , 50 , 82 or neutrons @xmath27=50 , 82 , 126 .",
    "total kinetic energy ( tke ) distribution is very close to the viola systematic as for fusion - fission : tke=@xmath28 or tke may be higher if the angular momentum of the splitting dns was large .",
    "[ ymasdiss ] shows the evolution of the mass distribution as a function of the dns lifetime calculated in the dns model for the @xmath15ca + @xmath29sm reaction .",
    "the quasifission process events are observed at reaction times longer than @xmath302@xmath31s .",
    "the maximum of mass distribution of quasifission products can be located around or far from the initial masses of colliding nuclei in dependence on the peculiarities of the shell structure of the initial and being formed nuclei . therefore , mass distribution of the quasifission products are different in the @xmath15ca + @xmath29sm and @xmath15ca + @xmath32sm reactions .",

    "[ ymasdiss ] and [ masdis154 ] .    from the analysis of the experimental data in reactions induced by the ca , ti , and cr projectiles on the actinide targets @xcite the authors concluded that the only peaks in the mass distribution between mass symmetric region @xmath33 and mass of the projectile - like fragments belong to the quasifission products .",

    "@xcite compared the results of the above mentioned reactions with the @xmath36o+@xmath37w reaction . in this reaction , a peak of fissionlike products which is significative of the presence of quasifission was not observed in the expected area of the mass distribution .",

    "@xcite concluded that there is no components of quasifission in this reaction too . from our point of view",
    "the quasifission components are mixed with projectile - like and target - like products .",
    "but they excluded from the analysis the reaction products with masses @xmath38 and corresponding conjugate heavy fragments @xmath39 assuming that there is no quasifission components with masses @xmath38 .",
    "we think that the experimentalists underestimate capture and quasifission cross sections and , therefore , they lost information about reaction mechanism ignoring the products with masses @xmath38 .",
    "there is a mixing of products of the quasifission and deep - inelastic collisions near the projectile - like and target - like fragments masses ( see fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and figs . [ ymasdiss ] and [ masdis154 ] of this paper ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that in the @xmath15ca + @xmath40pb reaction the part of the quasifission products are concentrated near masses of the projectile - like and target - like products due peculiarities of the shell structure in the colliding double magic nuclei .",
    "the part of the quasifission products mixed with the ones of deep - inelastic collisions should not be ignored at analysis of the experimental data and the attempts to extract an information from the studies of these products lead to new results about capture reactions at low energies .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the quasifission fragments can be mixed with the fusion - fission products in the mass symmetric region . the symmetric region is reachable for the mass distribution during evolution of dns at more high energies before its decay into two quasifission fragments ( see fig .",

    "we will discuss in the next section .",
    "the characteristic feature for the fusion - fission products is the isotropic angular distribution .",
    "the observed anisotropy in their angular distribution can be described by the transition saddle state model @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the variance of the @xmath43 ( projection of total spin of the fissioning nucleus on its symmetry axis ) distribution ; @xmath44 is the effective moment of inertia for the cn and its value is determined in the framework of the rotated finite range model by sierk @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath56 used in the analysis was determined from the measured total fission cross sections for which the fission probability is assumed to be equal 1 .",

    "the comparison of the experimental and theoretical values of the @xmath61 ratio as a function of @xmath62 shows that for some reactions like @xmath63s+@xmath40pb it is impossible to reach agreement between the corresponding values @xcite : the theoretical values underestimate noticeably the experimental data ( @xmath64 is the rigid moment of inertia for a sphere of equal volume ) .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite explained the deviation from the standard theoretical description of the experimental anisotropy by the contribution of quasifission components .",
    "so it was qualitatively recognized the perceptible contribution of the quasifission events in the yield of the @xmath63s+@xmath40pb reaction products .",
    "the rotational angles of the dns during capture and before its decay into two fragments can be calculated in our model presented in ref .",
    "for the given initial values of beam energy and orbital angular momentum @xmath65 the capture probability is found by solving the equation of motions @xcite .",
    "if we neglect the decrease of the angular momentum of the dns by emission of light particles ( gamma quanta , neutrons , _ etc .",

    "we should note that @xmath23 is less than the initial orbital angular momentum @xmath65 due to dissipation during capture @xcite .",
    "knowing of @xmath23 and moment of inertia @xmath66 of the dns allows us to find its angular velocity @xmath67 . at the considered beam energies ,",
    "the dns is formed when the interacting nuclei are trapped into potential well : the relative kinetic energy decreases due to the dissipation and it becomes not enough to overcome the quasifission barrier by the classical dynamical way ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "the characteristic lifetime of dns at quasifission is large than @xmath68s which is time for the deep inelastic collisions . to find the angular distribution of the quasifission fragments we estimate the rotational angle @xmath69 at break - up of the system : @xmath70 it can be found if we know the lifetime ( @xmath71 ) of the rotating dns which is heated up to the effective temperature @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the excitation energy of dns : @xmath74 .",

    "the theoretical results ( solid line ) overestimate noticeably the experimental quasifission cross section ( solid triangles ) . how this difference can be explained ?",
    "the first reason is the exclusion of the fissionlike products having mass numbers outside of the mass range @xmath108 from their analysis by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "but the increase of beam energy leads to formation of dns with large angular momentum and the products of its decay can have isotropic angular distribution . therefore ,",
    "such events were considered as a fusion - fission fragments although they belong to quasifission .",
    "some part of the dns mass distribution moves to the mass symmetric region due to the increase of excitation energy of dns .",
    "our theoretical results showing the increase in the quasifission fragment yields in the mass symmetric region are presented in the right panel of fig .",

    "[ compcross ] that the sum of the experimental values of the fusion - fission and quasifission cross sections are very close to our theoretical results at @xmath119 mev although the proportion of the contributions are different .",
    "the mixing of the quasifission and fusion - fission products causes ambiguity at the reconstruction of the complete fusion cross section from the registered fission products .",
    "this is a reason why our theoretical results for quasifission events overestimate the corresponding experimental data and why our theoretical results for fusion - fission products underestimate the corresponding data presented by authors .",
    "we showed that the partial cross section of quasifission component of binary fragments are distributed in the whole range of the angular momentum values leading to capture @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the angular momentum distributions of the compound nucleus and dinuclear system going to quasifission overlap because competition between complete fusion and quasifission takes place at all values of initial orbital angular momentum .",
    "our conclusion is different from the assumption that quasifission occurs in the range @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the upper limit of angular momentum leading to complete fusion @xcite .",
    "but the partial cross section of fast fission process is distributed in the angular momentum range @xmath120 where the fission barrier for the cn is equal to zero .",
    "calculations of lifetime of the rotating dinuclear system demonstrated that at the near coulomb barrier energies the angular distribution of the quasifission fragments with the projectile - like masses can reach large angles . the maximum of the angular distribution moves to the forward ( backward for conjugate fragment ) angles by the increase of the beam energy due to the decrease of the lifetime of the dinuclear system .",
    "the calculation of the mass distribution of the quasifission products showed that during its evolution it can reach the mass symmetric region .",
    "so , if the angular distribution fragments of this region becomes isotropic then it is impossible to separate them from fusion - fission components . as result",
    "the quasifission components which could be considered as fusion - fission products lead to overestimation of the probability of the compound nucleus formation .",
