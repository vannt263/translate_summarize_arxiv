    "we will describe our results .      while considering the dynamical features , we observe three classes of impacts which are common both to vesta s and ceres impactors . the first class is composed by the isl primordial impactors : is characterised by low impact velocities , always inferior to @xmath153 km / s , and a continuous mass spectrum over the range we considered ( see figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the second class is composed by the isl resonant impactors : this class too has a continuous mass spectrum , but the characteristic velocities are systematically higher than those of the first class , ranging between @xmath159 km / s ( see figs . [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the third class of impacts is due to the bsl impactors : there is no evident distinction between the impacts due to bsl resonant and non - resonant planetesimals , with the only exception of the ceres @xmath18 migration scenario .",
    "the bsl impactors globally tend to cluster towards higher mass values as a consequence of the mass - heliocentric distance relationship assumed in the model ( eq . [ masslaw ] ) .",
    "the impact speeds of bsl impactors mostly overlap the same range of values of the resonant isl impactors but , depending on the migration scenario , a fraction can hit the asteroids with velocities higher than @xmath151 km / s ( see figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ) . in one case",
    "we recorded an impact velocity value of about @xmath160 km / s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , bottom right panel ) .",
    "+      while considering the craterisation due to the impacts , we observe that isl and bsl planetesimals form two different classes . as a general rule",
    ", isl - related craters completely dominate the crater distributions on the two asteroids up to sizes of @xmath161 ( see figs . [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "bsl - related craters , whose sizes are generally distributed between @xmath162 and @xmath163 , are responsible for the high - end tail ( @xmath164 ) of the simulated crater distributions ( see figs . [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] taking into account that the isl - related crater frequencies are divided by @xmath165 ) . more in detail , for both asteroid we observe the following interesting result . in jupiter s no - migration scenario the high - end tail ( @xmath166 ) of the crater size distribution is completely due to bsl - related impacts ( see figs . [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] , top left panels ) . for increasing values of the displacement of jupiter s formation region from its present position , we expect only few bsl - related craters with size greater than @xmath167 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] [ fig12 ] , top right and bottom left panels ) . at the same time",
    ", the high - end tail of the isl - related crater distribution partially overlaps with the bsl - related crater distribution ( ibid ) . in the @xmath18 migration scenario ,",
    "the high - end tail of the isl - related crater distribution completely overlap with the bsl - related one , cancelling its contribution in terms of crater frequency ( see figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] , bottom right panels ) . in ceres case",
    ", we observe that in this migration scenario the contribution of bsl impacts could survive only for crater sizes higher than @xmath168 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , bottom right panel ) .      to evaluate the effects of isl and bsl impacts on the internal structure of the asteroids , we computed the ratio between the energy delivered by the impacts and the self - gravitation energies of vesta and ceres ( see figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] ) . in vesta s case",
    "the delivered energy spans in the range @xmath169 ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) while in ceres case , due to the greater size of the latter , the range is shifted by an order of magnitude , i.e. between @xmath170 ( fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) .",
    "bsl impactors near the frequency peak in their distribution generally deliver @xmath146 orders of magnitude more energy than isl impactors at their corresponding peak ( see figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] ) . in analogy to what we observed for the surface cratering , in jupiter s",
    "no - migration scenario isl impacts dominate the low - energy tail of the distribution while bsl impacts are mainly responsible of the high - energy tail ( ibid ) . for increasing values of jupiter s radial displacement , however , the high - end tail of the isl distribution shifts toward higher energy values , incresingly overlapping to the bsl distribution ( ibid ) .",
    "the contribution of bsl impactors thus become more and more negligible for increasing values of jupiter s radial displacement and is completely masked by that of isl impactors in the @xmath18 migration scenario ( ibid ) .",
    "this effect hold true also in ceres case , where the bsl population of impactors is enhanced due to the excitation of a mean motion resonance with jupiter . from our results",
    "it is clearly visible as , due to its smaller size , impacts would deliver on vesta an higher amount of energy per units of self - gravitation energy ( the high - energy tail being of the order of @xmath157 , see fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) and are more likely to shatter or significally fracture the asteroid .",
    "our results suggest that the cratering histories of vesta and ceres should be strongly correlated to the timescale of jupiter formation and to its radial displacement .",
    "if vesta or ceres formed before jupiter s core reached its critical mass , the expected crater distribution on the surfaces of the two asteroids should show different effects at different times . at the beginning ,",
    "the crater distribution is dominated by impacts of small rocky bodies that should have lead to an intense and uniform craterisation .",
    "these low - velocity impacts could have contributed to the accretion of the asteroids .",
    "after jupiter starts to accrete gas , a second phase of more energetic impacts takes place . due to their lower number ,",
    "bsl planetesimals contribute less to the craterisation but , with their higher impact energies , they affect the resurfacing and the thermal histories of the asteroids .",
    "a significant fraction of resonant isl bodies should have impacted the asteroids at supersonic speed , contributing to their excavation and fragmentation .",
    "jupiter s migration should have important effects on this picture , changing the impact speeds and the relative abundances of isl and bsl populations .",
