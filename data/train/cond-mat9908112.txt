    "due to the interplay of spin , charge , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom the doped perovskite manganites ( la@xmath11me@xmath12mn@xmath11mn@xmath13o@xmath2 ; me = ca , sr , pb , and ba @xcite ) reveal a variety of interesting phenomena , among which colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) @xcite , which also can be induced by an electric field @xcite , magnetic - field induced structural phase transitions @xcite and photo - induced metal to insulator transitions @xcite can be found .",
    "this variety of very unusual phenomena corresponds to a complex ( x , b , t)-phase diagram exhibiting magnetic order , which strongly depends on the hole concentration @xcite , orbital order @xcite , charge order @xcite and different structural phases , which depend on the tolerance factor and on long - range jahn - teller distortions @xcite .",
    "the ground - state properties of the manganites arise from the orbital degeneracy with a strong hund s coupling and are derived from a strong competence of super - exchange @xcite and double - exchange @xcite interactions and by the concomitant appearance of charge order and long - range jahn - teller distortions .    a phase diagram for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 for strontium - doping concentrations @xmath14 0.2 has been published recently by paraskevopoulos et al",
    ". @xcite . in accordance to an early investigation @xcite the sequence rhombohedral @xmath5 to orthorhombic @xmath15 ( at a transition temperature of 1020 k ) and then to another orthorhombic @xmath16 structure ( at 760 k ) was observed in pure lamno@xmath2 , which is electrically insulating and displays antiferromagnetic ordering of the mn@xmath9 ions at the neel temperature @xmath17 = 140 k. the three octahedral mn - o lengths are strongly anisotropic in the @xmath16 phase , due to a long - range jahn - teller distortion , and become almost equal in the @xmath15 phase . with increasing doping concentration @xmath7 the conductivity of the manganites increases .",
    "this can be attributed to the growing amount of holes in the lattice on mn@xmath18 sites .",
    "owing to the strong hund s coupling , the hopping of an e@xmath10 electron between mn@xmath9 and mn@xmath18 sites is the dominating mechanism for the conductivity of manganites in the paramagnetic regime @xcite . driven by an increasing concentration of mobile holes , at low temperatures the insulating and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structure passes to a purely metallic and ferromagnetic state for @xmath19 .",
    "close to @xmath20 the ground state is a ferromagnetic ( fm ) insulator .",
    "the jahn - teller distortions of the @xmath16 phase become suppressed for @xmath21 , where the undistorted @xmath15 phase extends to the lowest temperatures .",
    "the competition between ferromagnetism and anitferromagnetism causes a complicated ground state . at the moment ,",
    "the coexistence of antiferromagnetic spin correlations along with the conventional ferromagnetic spin correlations is explained either within the framework of a canted antiferromagnetic ( ca ) state or with a mixed two - phase state .",
    "the existence of a phase separation was reported in the lightly doped la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 samples from a computational analysis in the framework of the two - orbital kondo model with jahn - teller polarons @xcite .",
    "a phase separation was found to occur between ( i ) hole - undoped antiferromagnetic and hole - rich paramagnetic regions and ( ii ) antiferomagnetic and ferromagnetic phase with low , respectively high , hole concentration .",
    "recent neutron scattering@xcite , optical@xcite , and nmr @xcite measurements on manganites can be interpreted in the framework of this theoretical model .",
    "the perovskite manganites show intense electron - spin - resonance ( esr ) signals with a large variation of the esr - line parameters as a function of the temperature @xcite .",
    "several controversial approaches have been made to explain the esr data in manganites . in the paramagnetic state",
    "the esr spectrum consists of a single resonance line with a g value near 2.0 .",
    "the broad esr line in pure lamno@xmath22 ( esr linewidth @xmath23 2.5 koe at room temperature ) was ascribed to mn@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the linear temperature dependence of the linewidth in la@xmath24sr@xmath25mno@xmath2 and la@xmath26bi@xmath27ca@xmath25mno@xmath2 was related to contributions from spin - phonon relaxation @xcite .",
    "the characteristic differences observed in esr intensity and linewidth in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath7=0.1 ; 0.2 ) ceramic samples were attributed to a model , in which a bottlenecked spin relaxation takes place from mn@xmath18 ions via mn@xmath9 jahn - teller ions to the lattice @xcite .",
    "the authors argue that the esr signal is due to mn@xmath18 only , but renormalized by the exchange coupling to mn@xmath9 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that all mn spins contribute to the esr signal in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath7 = 0.1 ; 0.2 ; 0.3 ) single crystals .",
    "the authors suggest that the linewidth increases linearly as a result of spin - lattice relaxation involving a single phonon .",
    "finally , causa et al.@xcite showed that all mn spins contribute to the resonance in perovskite compounds a@xmath24me @xmath25mno@xmath2 ( a = la , pr ; me = ca , sr ) due to spin - spin interactions , and not only the mn@xmath18 or some spin clusters , with no evidence of a spin - phonon contribution to the experimental linewidth .",
    "therefore , it is very important to perform esr measurements on manganites in an extended concentration and temperature range in order to clarify the situation and to correlate the results with different theoretical models .",
    "there are extremely few publications devoted to the esr studies on manganites in the low doped region with only several doping concentrations of @xmath7 @xmath28 0.2 @xcite .    in the present paper we report on our systematic esr study in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath7 = 0 ; 0.05 ; 0.075 ; 0.1 ; 0.125 ; 0.15 ; 0.175 ; 0.2 ) single crystals in the paramagnetic regime in attempt to compare the temperature dependence of the width and intensity of the esr lines with a detailed and complete phase diagram",

    "particular attention is devoted to the discussion of the linewidth in the jahn - teller distorted phase .",
    "single crystals of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 were grown by the floating - zone method with radiation heating in air atmosphere , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . the purity of the chemicals used for sample preparation ( la@xmath29o@xmath2 , srco@xmath2 and mn@xmath2o@xmath30 ) was not less than 99.99% .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction proved that the grown materials were of single phase .",
    "however , two dimensional x - ray tv topography of the crystals has revealed a twin structure .",
    "esr measurements were performed with a bruker elexsys e500 cw - spectrometer at x - band frequencies ( @xmath31 9.2 ghz ) equipped with continuous gas - flow cryostats for he ( oxford instruments ) and n@xmath29 ( bruker ) in the temperature range between 4.2 k and 680 k. small crystals of 0.6 - 3.7 mg were chosen for our esr experiments to avoid the sample - size effects @xcite .",
    "the samples were placed into quartz tubes and fixed with either paraffin ( at low temperatures 4 k @xmath32 300 k ) or nacl ( at 300 k @xmath32 680 k ) .",
    "we have restricted our experiments to the paramagnetic regime ( @xmath33 ) only , because within the magnetically ordered regime the esr behavior is very sample dependent , which is attributed to magnetic inhomogeneity of the samples in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases due to local variations of oxygen stoichiometry and chemical composition @xcite .",
    "electron - spin resonance detects the power @xmath34 absorbed by the sample from the transverse magnetic microwave field as a function of the static magnetic field @xmath35 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra is improved by recording the derivative @xmath36 with lock - in technique .",
    "esr spectra , which are characteristic for the three structural phases of the paramagnetic regime , are presented in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , illustrating their evolution with sr concentration @xmath7 ( left column ) and temperature @xmath37 ( right column ) . within the whole paramagnetic regime",
    "the spectrum consists of a broad , exchange narrowed resonance line , which is well fitted by a dysonian line shape @xcite . as the linewidth @xmath38 is of the same order of magnitude as the resonance field @xmath39 in the present compounds , one has to take into account both circular components of the exciting linearly polarized microwave field .",
    "therefore the resonance at the reversed magnetic field @xmath40 has to be included into the fit formula for the esr signal , given by @xmath41 this is an asymmetric lorentzian line , which includes both absorption and dispersion , where @xmath42 denotes the dispersion - to - absorption ratio .",
    "such asymmetric line shapes are usually observed in metals , where the skin effect drives electric and magnetic microwave components out of phase in the sample and therefore leads to an admixture of dispersion into the absorption spectra . for samples small",
    "compared to the skin depth one expects a symmetric absorption spectrum ( @xmath42 = 0 ) , whereas for samples large compared to the skin depth absorption and dispersion are of equal strength yielding an asymmetric resonance line ( @xmath42 = 1 ) .    at low sr concentrations or at low temperatures the spectra are nearly symmetric with respect to the resonance field in accordance with pure absorption spectra with @xmath42=0 .",
    "with increasing @xmath7 or @xmath37 they become more and more asymmetric corresponding to an increasing parameter @xmath42 . to check , whether the skin effect is the reason for the asymmetric line shape , we have to estimate the skin depth @xmath43 from the electric resistance @xmath44 and the microwave frequency @xmath45 ghz ( @xmath46 vs / am ) . using the resistance values determined by mukhin @xcite - for example @xmath44 = 0.2 @xmath47 cm for @xmath48 at room temperature - we find a skin depth @xmath49 0.16 mm . within the whole paramagnetic regime",
    ", the resistance values decrease by at least two orders of magnitude with increasing temperature or increasing sr concentration .",
    "therefore the skin depth is larger than the sample dimensions at low @xmath37 or @xmath7 and becomes comparable to or even smaller than the thickness of the sample as these parameters increase in accordance with the increasing asymmetry of the esr spectra .",
    "the resonance field of all compounds under investigation yields a g value slightly below the free - electron value , which is usual for transition - metal ions with a less than half filled d shell @xcite .",
    "this g value is found to be nearly isotropic @xmath50 in both the orthorhombic @xmath15 and the rhombohedral @xmath5 phase , but it reveals a weak anisotropy 1.94 @xmath51 1.98 within the jahn - teller distorted @xmath16 phase . finally approaching the ordering temperature from above , the whole resonance becomes seriously distorted and is strongly shifted to lower or higher fields dependent on the orientation of the sample .",
    "this is caused by internal fields due to the onset of magnetic order .",
    "more detailed information on the different phases is obtained from the resonance linewidth and the esr intensity , which are presented in the following subsection .      in fig .",
    "[ hwhmvst ] the esr linewidth @xmath38 is plotted versus temperature for all investigated samples . here the orientation of the single crystals was adjusted to the most pronounced temperature dependence , which could be found within the jahn - teller distorted @xmath16 phase and is described in more detail below . only for the pure sample",
    "@xmath52 it was impossible to find an unequivocal orientation as it is presumably a twinned crystal . on the other hand ,",
    "the crystals with sr concentrations @xmath53 had not been oriented , because they never reach the jahn - teller distorted regime and their paramagnetic spectra are isotropic .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath38 is approximately constant in the whole temperature range 150 k @xmath54 650 k in pure lamno@xmath2 , because the structural transition into the @xmath15 phase takes place close to 800 k @xcite .",
    "however , in all doped samples the temperature dependence of @xmath38 exhibits a number of deviations from a monotonic behavior , which we identified with different magnetic and structural phase transitions .",
    "at lowest temperatures of observation ( 150 k @xmath54 200 k ) @xmath38 passes a minimum , as the temperature approaches @xmath17 from above , and then increases abruptly near @xmath17 .",
    "this dependence indicates the transition from the paramagnetic regime into the magnetically ordered structure and is connected with the strong shift of the resonance field mentioned above .",
    "the typical features of the linewidth obtained within the different paramagnetic regimes can be summarized as follows :    \\(a ) orthorhombic strongly jahn - teller distorted @xmath16 phase : a strongly anisotropic linewidth was observed in the lightly doped samples with @xmath55",
    "[ dhsr005 ] depicts the temperature dependence of the linewidth for the three main orientations of the external magnetic field @xmath35 in la@xmath56sr@xmath27mno@xmath2 .",
    "if the magnetic field is found within the a - b plane , the linewidth passes a maximum with increasing temperature , whereas the linewidth remains nearly constant , if the field is parallel to the c axis . at @xmath37 = 600 k , where the structural transition to the @xmath15 phase takes place , the values of @xmath38",
    "coincide for all directions .",
    "the angular dependence of the linewidth , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ angle ] , can be commonly described by @xmath57 . at the temperature of maximal anisotropy ( @xmath37 = 400 k ) we found the ratio @xmath58 .",
    "\\(b ) orthorhombic @xmath15 phase : the upper temperature limit of the anisotropy in the linewidth is changing in the @xmath59 doped samples from 600 k ( @xmath7 = 0.05 ) to 260 k ( @xmath7 = 0.125 ) .",
    "this coincides quite well with the @xmath60 transition from the strongly jahn - teller distorted orthorhombic structure to the weakly distorted orthorhombic pseudocubic one . in this phase ,",
    "the linewidth @xmath38 exhibits a linear temperature dependence with a typical slope of about 2 oe / k .",
    "\\(c ) rhombohedral @xmath5 phase : again , a linear temperature dependence of the linewidth is observed for all samples investigated in this phase ( @xmath61 ) up to 600 k. its slope is comparable to the @xmath15 phase . for @xmath62 there is a slight kink at the @xmath63 transition .",
    "finally , the data points at the highest temperatures of this investigation @xmath64 indicate a tendency to saturation of @xmath38 .",
    "the integrated intensity @xmath65 of the resonance line measures the spin susceptibility @xmath66 of the esr probe . for ferromagnetically",
    "coupled ions its temperature dependence usually follows a ( @xmath67 curie - weiss law , where @xmath68 is the curie - weiss temperature .",
    "if all spins take part in producing the esr signal , it is reasonable to plot @xmath69 versus @xmath37 and to expect a linear behavior all over the paramagnetic regime .",
    "however , as one can obtain from fig .",
    "[ intens ] , this procedure does not yield a unique linear temperature dependence at all .",
    "only lamno@xmath2 behaves linearely with a curie - weiss temperature @xmath70 87 k in the complete temperature range under consideration . for sr concentrations 0.05 @xmath71 0.125",
    "we observe a distinct kink near the structural phase transition @xmath60 , just at the temperature where the anisotropy of the linewidth starts to decrease with increasing temperature . below this kink",
    ", the inverse intensity shows a linear temperature dependence with a similar slope as in lamno@xmath2 .",
    "the respective curie - weiss temperatures increase with increasing sr concentration up to @xmath72 208 k. to analyze the origin of the esr signal , we compared its intensity at temperatures below the kink to the esr intensity of the so called green phase gd@xmath29bacuo@xmath73 , which exhibits an esr signal with a similar linewidth .",
    "the respective compound , in which all gd@xmath9 spins contribute to the esr signal , shows a curie - weiss susceptibility with @xmath74 k @xcite .",
    "starting with pure lamno@xmath2 , we found that all mn@xmath9 ions contribute to the esr signal with their full magnetic moment in the @xmath16 phase . with increasing sr concentration @xmath7 the averaged magnetic moment of both mn@xmath9 and mn@xmath18 ions even increases slightly by nearly 10 percent up to @xmath48 within this phase , although mn@xmath18 ions ( spin s = 3/2 ) exhibit a smaller magnetic moment than mn@xmath9 ions ( spin s = 2 ) . above the kink",
    "the inverse intensity again reaches a linear temperature dependence with a remarkably higher slope than below the kink ( about 13 and 8 times the low - temperature slope for x = 0.05 and 0.1 respectively ) . as the inverse slope measures the total number of spins , which generate the esr signal , about 90 percent of the spins seem to become invisible at the transition to the @xmath15 phase , suggesting that the contribution of all mn@xmath9 ions disappears",
    "however , we have to take the skin effect into account once more .",
    "comparing the temperature of the kink in the intensity with the resistance data @xcite , we realize that it approximately coincides with the temperature , where the specific resistance drops below 1 @xmath47 cm with increasing temperature .",
    "this corresponds to a skin depth of about 0.4 mm , which is of the order of the sample size .",
    "therefore , the part of the crystal , which is accessible for the microwave field and contributes to the esr signal , is more and more reduced with increasing temperature . to check the importance of the skin effect in our experiments",
    ", we investigated a powder sample with a sr concentration @xmath75 .",
    "its inverse esr intensity still showed a discontinuity at the phase transition @xmath60 but at higher temperatures it attained nearly the same slope as at low temperatures , indicating that all mn spins contribute to the esr signal in the @xmath15 phase , as well .",
    "before we analyze the linewidth data in detail , we first focus on the esr intensity in order to show that its temperature dependence is in accordance with the behavior expected for mn@xmath9 within an intermediate octahedral ligand field under the influence of distortion @xcite : the octahedral field splits the five d orbitals into a lower triplet t@xmath76 and an upper doublet e@xmath10 with an energy splitting of about 10@xmath77 k. in the case of intermediate ligand fields the dominating hund s coupling causes a parallel spin alignment of the four d electrons , where three of them occupy the triplet t@xmath76 and the forth is found in the doublet e@xmath10 ( so called high - spin state s=2 ) .",
    "therefore the ground state is an orbital doublet @xmath78 .",
    "including the spin , the @xmath78 state is tenfold degenerated .",
    "this degeneration is lifted by second order spin - orbit couplings into a manifold of singlet , doublet , and triplet states with an overall splitting of about 20 k @xcite . for this case",
    "the zeeman effect is very complicated and the observation of an esr signal is rather unlikely .",
    "the situation changes drastically for a tetragonal jahn - teller distortion , which splits the orbital doublet @xmath78 into two singlets with a typical energy gap of the order 10@xmath79 k. then the ground state is a spin quintuplet with usual zeeman effect .",
    "taking the spin - orbit coupling into account , the esr signal is expected at about @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite , which agrees very well with our experimental data . in the case of mn@xmath18 in an octahedral field , the three d electrons occupy the triplet t@xmath76 with parallel spin alignment s = 3/2 .",
    "the ground state is an orbital singlet @xmath82 with a spin quadruplet .",
    "this yields an esr signal with an isotropic g value at about @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the esr signal is due to all mn@xmath9 and mn@xmath18 spins within the jahn - teller distorted @xmath16 phase .",
    "the increase of the averaged moment with the sr concentration @xmath7 , which is found in contrast to the expected linear superposition of mn@xmath9 and mn@xmath18 spins , agrees with susceptibility measurements @xcite and may be ascribed to ferromagnetic polarization around the mn@xmath18 spins . with suppression of the jahn - teller distortion at the transition @xmath84 the contribution of the mn@xmath9 ions should vanish , if their surrounding is ideally octahedral .",
    "obviously the weak orthorhombic distortion of the @xmath15 phase is still strong enough to retain the esr signal of mn@xmath9 .",
    "the result that the jahn - teller mn@xmath9 ions dominate the esr signal within the @xmath16 phase is essential for the following discussion of the linewidth within this regime : all significant peculiarities of the esr spectra in the respective phase , i. e. the magnitude of the esr linewidth , its anisotropy , and the anisotropy of the resonance field , are very similar to those observed by tanaka et al .",
    "@xcite in the quasi - one dimensional compound cscucl@xmath2 .",
    "that system exhibits a cooperative jahn - teller effect in the temperature range between 120 k and 560 k. the authors explain their esr results due to dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) antisymmetric interaction @xcite between jahn - teller cu@xmath85 ions i and j , given by @xmath86 .",
    "\\label{dmham}\\ ] ] esr investigations in kcuf@xmath2 @xcite and cugeo@xmath2 @xcite , which are quasi - one dimensional systems as well , have been treated in a similar way . in those publications",
    "it was shown that the usual dipolar or anisotropic exchange interactions can not produce the observed linewidth of the order of 10@xmath79 oe , because the strong exchange interaction between the cu@xmath85 ions leads to a considerable narrowing of the esr line . the present compound la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 exhibits comparable exchange interactions between mn@xmath9 ions ( for @xmath7 = 0 ) with spin @xmath87 = 2 and between mn@xmath9 and mn@xmath18 ions with @xmath87 = 3/2 ( for @xmath88 ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the broad esr line in the strongly jahn - teller distorted @xmath16 phase of lamno@xmath2 can be interpreted in terms of the dm antisymmetric interaction @xcite between mn@xmath9 ions , which are strongly super - exchange coupled via oxygen ions . the dominancy of the antisymmetric interactions in the jahn - teller distorted phase is also confirmed by the fact that non - jahn - teller mn@xmath18 ions suppress the line - broadening for @xmath89 .",
    "this finding supports the suggestion of millis @xcite that strong coupling between charges and lattice is observed in the sr doped manganites due to the cooperative jahn - teller effect for sr concentrations less than @xmath90 0.15 .",
    "looking at the magnetic structure @xcite of the antiferromagnetic phase ( see fig .",
    "[ struc ] ) , one recognizes that each mn@xmath9 ion is coupled ferromagnetically to its four next mn@xmath9 neighbors within the a - b plane and antiferromagnetically to the other two in direction of the c axis .",
    "therefore the compound is quasi - one dimensional along the antiferromagnetically coupled mn@xmath9 chains in c direction , and the analysis can be performed similar to the compounds cited above . following yamada @xcite , for temperatures @xmath91 large compared to the exchange interaction @xmath92 between the mn ions , the linewidth contribution @xmath93 of the dm interaction is approximated by @xmath94 where @xmath95 = ( 1 + @xmath96)/4 for @xmath97 parallel or @xmath95 = ( 2 + @xmath98)/8 for @xmath97 perpendicular to the quasi - one dimensional chain direction .",
    "furthermore the g - shift @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 denote the absolute value of @xmath97 and the mean value of the anisotropic g tensor , respectively .    from fig .",
    "[ dhsr005 ] and fig .",
    "[ angle ] we obtain that for high temperatures @xmath103 300 k the linewidth changes only slightly within the a - b plane but is strongly anisotropic with respect to the c axis following a @xmath104 law . as it is shown in the insert of fig .",
    "[ dhsr005 ] , the anisotropy reaches a maximum value of @xmath105 .",
    "this agrees quite well with the expected value of 1.5 for @xmath95 = ( 2 + @xmath104)/8 .",
    "so the vector @xmath97 is pointing perpendicular to the quasi - one dimensional chain direction .",
    "to identify the origin of the dm interaction in the present system and to estimate its magnitude , we have to take into account the distortions of the crystal structure ( see fig .

    "the situation is very similar to that which occurs in rfeo@xmath2 , where r denotes a rare - earth ion , because the orbitals @xmath113 are not active in the super - exchange coupling of fe@xmath9-o@xmath108-fe@xmath9 , too . using the channel model @xcite ,",
    "we get @xmath114 furthermore we can estimate the parameter of the dm interaction in the same manner @xcite @xmath115 using the data for fe@xmath9 from ref .",
    "@xcite and taking into account the dependencies of @xmath92 and @xmath101 on the bridge angle @xmath109 we finally get for mn@xmath9 @xmath92 = 67 k and @xmath101 = 2.54 k. with these values we estimate the expected g - shift @xmath116 and linewidth @xmath117 koe , which agree quite well with the experimental results .",
    "finally we shortly comment on the temperature dependence of the linewidth in both @xmath15 and @xmath5 phases , which has been discussed controversially by several authors as mentioned in the introduction . for intermediate sr concentrations 0.075 @xmath28 @xmath7 @xmath28 0.15",
    "the linear increase of the linewidth may be due to the spin - lattice relaxation , as it was suggested in ref .",

    "the infinite - temperature linewidth for different doped manganites with me - concentration @xmath7 = 0.33 observed in the latter study up to 1000 k was kept as adjustable parameter , which is related to spin - only interactions .",
    "very recent studies of shengelaya et al.@xcite notice the similarity between temperature dependence of esr linewidth and conductivity in manganites , which is determined by the hopping motion of small polarons @xcite .",
