    "for more than 25 years , inflation  @xcite has been considered a paradigm to solve , at the same time , standard cosmological puzzles related to initial conditions like the flatness , horizon , and isotropy problems , and , as a bonus , astroparticle issues like the monopole excess . more important , it also predicts that primordial fluctuations , assumed to be of quantum origin , could be enhanced to the level required to trigger large scale structure formation , with an almost scale - invariant spectrum @xcite , which is confirmed by observations @xcite .",
    "the inflation paradigm is also endowed with two specific problems , that may ultimately be related , namely the meaning of the trans - planckian  @xcite perturbations and the existence of a past singularity  @xcite .",
    "concerning the latter , the existence of an initial singularity is one of the major drawbacks of classical cosmology . in spite of the fact that the standard cosmological model , based in the classical general relativity theory , has been successfully tested until the nucleosynthesis era ( around @xmath0 ) , the extrapolation of this model to higher energies leads to a breakdown of the geometry in a finite cosmic time .",
    "this breakdown of the geometry may indicate that the classical theory must be replaced by a quantum theory of gravitation : quantum effects may avoid the presence of the singularity , leading to a complete regular cosmological model .    among the fundamental questions that come from the quantization of the universe as a whole , one of the most important concerns the interpretation of the wave function of the universe .",
    "in order to extract predictions from it , the bohm - de broglie ( bdb ) ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite has been proposed @xcite , since it avoids many conceptual difficulties that follow from the application of the standard copenhagen interpretation to a unique system that contains everything . in opposition to the latter one ,",
    "the ontological interpretation does not need a classical domain outside the quantized system to generate the physical facts out of potentialities ( the facts are there _ ab initio _ because the positions and trajectories of the particles ( called bohmian trajectories ) are considered to be part of objective reality , and hence it can be applied to the universe as a whole .",
    "there are other alternative interpretations which can be used in quantum cosmology , like the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite , but we will not consider them here because they are probabilistic interpretations in essence . as we know @xcite , it is very difficult to obtain from the the wheeler - dewitt equation , when applied to a closed universe , a probabilistic interpretation for their solutions because of its hyperbolic nature ( see however further approachs @xcite ) . in the case of the bohm - de broglie interpretation , probabilities are useful but not essential , as long as objective trajectories ( universe histories ) can be calculated and their properties studied .",
    "probabilities can be recovered , as it has been suggested many times @xcite , at the semiclassical level , where a probability measure can be constructed with the quantum solutions .",
    "hence , we can take the wheeler - dewitt equation as it is , without imposing any probabilistic interpretation at the most fundamental level , but still obtaining information using the bohm - de broglie interpretation , and then recover probabilities when we reach the semiclassical level . with this interpretation in hands , one can ask if the quantum scenario predicted by the wave function of the universe is free of singularities , and which type of classical universe emerges from the quantum phase .",
    "quantum cosmology , in this framework , exhibits bouncing solutions @xcite which can be interpreted as truly avoiding the singularity . some of these bouncing models provide solutions to many cosmological puzzles , and may also yield a scale invariant cosmological perturbations as in inflationary models @xcite .",
    "bouncing models are also obtained in loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "some types of bouncing models were obtained in @xcite . in these references , the matter content of the primordial model",
    "was considered to be stiff matter , , that was proposed long time ago in @xcite . ]",
    "modeled by a free massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt equation turns out to be a two - dimensional klein - gordon equation , and gaussian superpositions , with positive width , of negative and positive frequency modes solutions were considered . in the flat case ,",
    "a two dimensional dynamical system for the bohmian trajectories was obtained , yielding a variety of possibilities : big bang - big crunch models , oscillating universes , bouncing solutions , and ever expanding ( contracting ) big bang ( big crunch ) models with a period of acceleration in the middle of their evolution .",
    "no non - singular purely expanding model with a primordial accelerated phase ( a non - singular inflationary model ) was obtained ( models of this type were obtained only with a non - minimal coupling between the scalar and gravitational fields , @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the gaussians superpositions of refs .",
    "@xcite to gaussians with complex widths and non negative real part .",
    "we obtain a richer two dimensional dynamical system .",
    "when the real part of the width is made zero , we obtain non - singular inflationary models which expand accelerately in the infinity past from flat universes with finite ( not zero ) size spatial sections , and is smoothly connected to a classical decelerated stiff matter expanding phase .",
    "it has features of the pre - big bang model @xcite and the emergent model @xcite without gracefull exit problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the classical model is presented .",
    "section iii is devoted to its quantization and the corresponding wheeler - dewitt equation is obtained .",
    "generalized gaussian superpositions of the quantum solutions , and their corresponding dynamical system are studied in section iv . in section",
    "v , the non - singular inflationary model is studied and its properties are presented and discussed . in section",
    "vi we present our conclusions .",
    "the model we take contains a massless free scalar field ( stiff matter ) , and the total lagrangian reads @xmath1 \\quad,\\ ] ] where we are using natural units @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , which is the planck length squared in these units .",
    "we will consider the spatially homogeneous and isotropic space - time line element , @xmath4 \\quad,\\ ] ] where the spatial curvature @xmath5 takes the values @xmath6 , @xmath7,@xmath8 .",
    "inserting this line element into the lagrangian ( [ lg2 ] ) , and omitting a total time derivative , we obtain the following minisuperspace action : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total volume divided by @xmath11 of the spacelike hypersurfaces , which are supposed to be closed .",
    "@xmath10 depends on the value of @xmath5 and on the topology of the hypersurfaces . for @xmath12",
    ", @xmath10 can have any value because the fundamental polyhedra of @xmath12 hypersurfaces can have arbitrary size ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of @xmath13 and topology @xmath14 , @xmath15 .    usually , the scale factor has dimensions of length because we use angular coordinates in closed spaces .",
    "also , in natural units , the scalar field has dimensions of the inverse of a length .",
    "hence we will define the dimensioless quantities @xmath16 , @xmath17 . calculating the hamiltonian , and omitting the bars , yields , @xmath18",
    "as @xmath19 appears as an overall multiplicative constant in the hamiltonian , we can set it equal to one without any loss of generality , keeping in mind that the physical scale factor which appears in the metric is @xmath20 , not @xmath21 .",

    "these solutions describe universes expanding from a singularity till a maximum size and contracting again to a big crunch . near the singularity , these solutions behave as in the flat case .",
    "there is no inflation .    *",
    "3 ) for @xmath35 : *    @xmath36    where @xmath29 is an integration constant , and again , from the conservation of @xmath25 we get @xmath37 as before , the cosmic time dependence is complicated and we will not write it here .",
    "these solutions describe universes contracting forever to or expanding forever from a singularity . near the singularity , these solutions behave as in the flat case .",
    "there is no inflation .",
    "hence , in all models there is at least one singularity and no acceleration phase , as it should be for a classical stiff matter fluid .",
    "let us now quantize the model .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt equation is obtained through the dirac quantization procedure , where the wave function must be annihilated by the operator version of the hamiltonian constraint . for the case of homogeneous minisuperspace models , which have a finite number of degrees of freedom",
    ", the minisuperspace wheeler - de witt equation reads @xmath38 the quantities @xmath39 are the phase space operators related to the homogeneous degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "usually this equation can be written as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the minisuperspace dewitt metric of the model , whose inverse is denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "writing @xmath43 in polar form , @xmath44 , and substituting it into ( [ bsc ] ) , we obtain the following equations :    @xmath45    @xmath46    where    @xmath47    is called the quantum potential .    the bohm -de broglie interpretation applied to quantum cosmology states that the trajectories @xmath48 are real , independently of any observations .",
    "equation ( [ hoqg ] ) represents their hamilton - jacobi equation , which is the classical one added with a quantum potential term eq.([hqgqp ] ) responsible for the quantum effects .",
    "this suggests to define    @xmath49    where the momenta are related to the velocities in the usual way :    @xmath50    to obtain the quantum trajectories we have to solve the following system of first order differential equations , called the guidance relations : @xmath51    eqs.([h3 ] ) are invariant under time reparametrization . hence , even at the quantum level , different choices of @xmath52 yield the same space - time geometry for a given non - classical solution @xmath53 .",
    "there is no problem of time in the bohm - de broglie interpretation of minisuperspace quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the full superspace , see @xcite@xcite , although the theory remains consistent , see @xcite@xcite ) .",

    "sufficient inflation can be obtained with reasonable choices of initial conditions ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "the picture is then of a universe that begins to inflate quantum mechanically from a planckian size closed flat space - time in the infinity past , and when it becomes large enough it makes a smooth transition to a decelerated classical stiff matter expansion , which will be eventually be dominated by radiation before nucleosynthesis .",
    "some reheating process must then also be presented in our model , and this could happen through interactions of the type @xmath170 , where @xmath43 represents some fermion field , @xmath171 is a coupling constant , and the scalar field decays into these fermions .",
    "such fermions would not be present in the beginning but they would have been produced when the universe got bigger and transitated to the decelerated phase .",
    "such extra term would not be relevant in the hamiltonian which describes the model when the universe was small ( it is proprtional to @xmath11 ) and empty of these fermions , justifying our quantum solutions in this regime .",
    "however , when the fermions begin to be produced afterwards , our quantum solutions could not be anymore reliable . at this stage ,",
    "when the model becomes decelerated and gets closer to classical behaviour , this solution must be connected to the classical radiation plus stiff matter solution .",
    "the nonclassical behaviour of our bohmian quantum solution for @xmath172 should then be of course discarded , they are out of the range of the validity of our assumptions .",
    "therefore , our non - singular inflationary solution should be utilized only as a zeroth - order approximation to a realistic cosmological inflationary model , in the same way as the de sitter model or power law solutions are used for usual inflation @xcite .",
    "the improvement of the model , including reheating and a radiation field deserves further research as there are many possibilities to be investigated .",
    "another important step forward is to evaluate the evolution of cosmological perturbations using the formalism developped in ref .",

    "<S> a stiff matter - dominated universe modeled by a free massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) geometry is quantized . </S>",
    "<S> generalized complex - width gaussian superpositions of the solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation are constructed and the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum cosmology is applied . </S>",
    "<S> a planar dynamical system is found in which a diversity of quantum bohmian trajectories are obtained and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> one class of solutions represents non - singular inflationary models starting at infinity past from flat space - time with planckian size spacelike hypersurfaces , which inflates without inflaton but due to a quantum cosmological effect , until it makes an analytical graceful exit from this inflationary epoch to a decelerated classical stiff matter expansion phase . </S>"
