    "this indicates the inner surface of the densest circumstellar material ( csm ) that was ionized by the supernova uv flash .",
    "observations of the light echos provided a more comprehensive picture of the structure @xcite .",
    "the csm was found to have a peanut - like bipolar geometry , inclined at 43  to the line of sight .",
    "the complex circumstellar environment can be understood as analogous to the interacting stellar wind model , as originally proposed to explain planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "the progenitor star of sn 1987a , , is believed to have evolved from a red supergiant ( rsg ) to a blue supergiant ( bsg ) about 20000 years before core collapse @xcite .",
    "after the transition , the fast , low density bsg wind overran the slow , dense rsg wind and swept it into a circumstellar shell .",
    "some models suggest that the rsg wind could have been highly aspherical , due to a binary merger @xcite or to equatorial wind compression @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the subsequent interaction between the stellar outflow can reproduce the overall bipolar csm structure and can possibly explain the origin of the triple - ring nebula @xcite .    at radio frequencies ,",
    "an initial outburst from sn 1987a peaked on day 4 and then decayed rapidly @xcite .",
    "the radio emission was redetected again in mid-1990 by the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) @xcite and then by the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) @xcite .",
    "long term monitoring has shown a monotonic increase in the radio flux since the reappearance @xcite .",
    "this is believed to be synchrotron radiation from the continuous injection of nonthermal particles as the blast wave expands into the csm . in this general picture , electrons are accelerated to ultrarelativistic velocities by the shock and then interact with the magnetic field that is amplified by the rayleigh - taylor instability near the contact discontinuity @xcite .",
    "therefore the radio emission is expected to be generated between the forward and reverse shocks . a detailed time - dependent model of diffusive shock acceleration for sn 1987a",
    "was first discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite further improved the model by considering the accelerated ions that heat the upstream plasma and modify the shock front .",
    "@xcite slightly modified the physical picture and attributed the radio emission to the interaction between the ejecta and an hii region located inside the optical ring . in this model , the hii region is a shell of swept - up rsg wind photoionized by the bsg .",
    "the ongoing encounter between the shock and csm also predicts a steady increase in x - ray emission , which has been confirmed by long term x - ray monitoring @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was suggested by @xcite that the hii region would delay the encounter of the blast wave with the optical ring to @xmath5 ce . by then , there was predicted to be a drastic increase in the radio flux .    from an energetic point of view",
    ", generation of the radio emission requires much less energy compared to other wavebands such as optical and x - ray .",

    "applying the same technique to observations in 1992 - 1995 , @xcite discovered two bright lobes in the shell .",
    "the lobes were aligned along the major axis of the optical ring and the eastern lobe was about 1.2 - 1.8 times brighter then the western lobe .",
    "the atca 18ghz upgrade provided twice the angular resolution as at 9ghz , and confirmed all these structures in diffraction - limited images @xcite .",
    "the 18ghz image is well described by an inclined thick equatorial ring with the same orientation as the bipolar csm .",

    "the 1.4ghz image similarly shows two lobes coincident with the ones in the 9 and 18ghz images . in the hard x - ray band ,",
    "a thick ring morphology has also been observed @xcite , suggesting a similar emission process as at radio frequency .",
    "however , the optical hot spots , which are the inward protruding dense gas shocked by the blast wave @xcite , show no correlation to the radio lobes in position @xcite .",
    "although the emergence of the optical hot spots coincided with the arrival of the radio - producing shock at those regions @xcite , @xcite indicate that this had little effect on the morphology of the radio remnant .    as in many astrophysical observations ,",

    ", @xcite demonstrated that a robust way to obtain the remnant size is to model the visibility data directly in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane .",

    "the atca observations of sn  1987a discussed here were performed at 9 and 18ghz with 6 km array configurations . at 9ghz ,",
    "the source was observed approximately every six months with long integration times ( 6 - 12 hr ) at two simultaneous frequencies in the range 8.6 to 9.1ghz . in the observations ,",
    "the phase center was placed 10  south of the remnant to avoid any possible artifacts @xcite .",
    "detailed observational parameters of all the datasets used in this study are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "two atca 18ghz observations are included in the analysis .",
    "each was taken one day before or after a 9ghz observation , thus allowing a direct comparison between the two frequency bands .",
    "except for the last epoch , a preliminary analysis of all the 9 and 18ghz data has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with the _ miriad _ package @xcite .",
    "we examined the data carefully for bad points and rejected scans during poor atmospheric phase stability . from 1996",
    "onwards , the source has sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to allow phase self - calibration , which was performed with a 5 minute solution interval time .",
    "this time scale is long enough to integrate an appreciable s / n , but is short enough to track the atmospheric phase variations .",
    "the phase self - calibration results in a significant improvement in the fidelity of the complex gains for each antenna .",
    "after the calibration , we shifted the phase center to the supernova site and then averaged the visibility data in 5 minute intervals .",
    "again , this is long enough to obtain good s / n on each baseline , but is short enough to track the structure of the source .",
    "we note that there is negligible loss in amplitude due to time - averaging of the data , because the source is of small angular extent and has been shifted to the phase center @xcite .",
    "figures  [ natural ] and [ super ] show the diffraction - limited and super - resolved images , respectively , of the 9ghz observations ; some epochs were averaged together to boost the s / n ( see table  [ tab1 ] )",
    ". following the procedures described by @xcite , the dirty maps were first generated from the calibrated visibility data , then deconvolved using a maximum entropy ( mem ) algorithm @xcite .",

    "[ 12 mm ] of this paper ) , showing a morphology that is well - described by an inclined thick ring . based on the surface brightness at the center of the ring",
    ", @xcite argued that the radio morphology sits somewhere between a spherical shell and an equatorial ring .",
    "motivated by all these results , we below present a generic inclined torus model to capture the overall structure of the radio emission .",
    "we emphasize that our model is a simplified picture of the physical situation and that we have not attempted to reproduce every single detail of the emission .",
    "instead , this study aims to obtain characteristic scales of the emission , such as the size and height of the emitting region , and the evolution of these parameters with time .",
    "the extra - planar structure of sn 1987a mentioned above obviously does not fit into the simple picture of a spherical shell or a 2d ring , but is better described by a 3d torus with a finite thickness . to incorporate these features , we propose an equatorial belt torus model , i.e.  a spherical shell truncated at arbitrary latitude .",
    "this gives a continuous variation between a ring and a spherical shell geometry .",
    "[ draw ] illustrates this model .",
    "it is a truncated optically thin shell with uniform emissivity and inclined to the observer line of sight .",
    "the geometry is specified by the radius @xmath11 ( averaged between the inner and outer shells ) , the shock thickness @xmath12 ( as a fraction of @xmath11 ) and the half opening angle @xmath13 .",
    "additional parameters include the flux density @xmath14 , center position @xmath15 , inclination @xmath16 and position angle ( p.a . ) @xmath17 on the plane of the sky . in the limiting case of @xmath18 ,",
    "the torus is reduced to an equatorial ring , while @xmath19 gives a spherical shell .",
    "the east - west asymmetry of the remnant is modeled by a linear gradient in the torus emissivity across the equatorial plane ( not in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "hence two more parameters are introduced : the magnitude @xmath20 and the p.a .",
    "@xmath21 of the gradient .",
    "the former is normalized to the fractional change in flux density at @xmath11 , and the gradient direction is defined from the brightest point towards the faintest point , with the p.a .",
    "measured from the projected observer line of sight ( see fig .  [ draw ] ) .",
    "finally , we correct for light travel time effects . since the remnant flux is increasing , the north rim , which is about a light year closer to the earth than the south , appears brighter . also due to the finite speed of light , expansion of the remnant",
    "distorts the torus and shifts its center to the north . to derive corrections for both effects , we employed linear approximations to the expansion and light curve locally at each epoch , with the rate of change determined from the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found that the north rim is at most 20% brighter than the south as a result of the light travel effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of expansion are only of second order , at the level of less than 1% .",
    "therefore , the latter will be ignored throughout the following analysis .",
    "a detailed mathematical description of the torus model and light travel travel time effects is given in appendix  [ app ] .",
    "@xcite showed that a robust way to estimate the remnant s geometry is to model the visibility data directly in the @xmath8-@xmath9 domain , for which the measurement errors are uncorrelated and the fitting is not complicated by the deconvolution process . in order to do that , we first have to derive a 2d fourier transform for the inclined torus model .",
    "this was achieved by building up the model torus from thin rings , which can be transformed to fourier space analytically via the hankel transform @xcite .",
    "the linear gradients in the model , including the asymmetry and light travel time correction , are transformed using the convolution theorem and are turned into derivatives in the @xmath8-@xmath9 domain . putting these together",
    ", we obtain an analytic expression of the torus model under a fourier transform ( see appendix  [ app ] for the detailed formulae ) .",
    "once the model is established , the fitting procedure is by the minimization of @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the statistical uncertainty associated with each measurement . given that the rms noise levels in our final images is close to the thermal noise of the antenna receivers , we argue that other sources of errors in the measurement , including the systematic errors due to the calibration or instrumental effects are negligible .",
    "the @xmath24 minimization is carried out by the task uvfit in _ miriad _ , with modifications to the code for the torus model . as discussed ,",
    "the symmetry axis of the system has been well measured from optical observations of the triple - ring system and of light echoes @xcite .",
    "therefore , we fixed the orientation of the torus during the fit , by adopting the values @xmath25 and @xmath26 from @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the fits were estimated through a bootstrapping method @xcite , since the errors in the fits are likely to be non - gaussian . following the procedure described in @xcite , boostrap samples were generated by randomly drawing the visibility measurements from an observation , with replacement .",
    "after the same number of visibilities as the data have been drawn , the bootstrap replica is fitted with the same procedure to obtain the torus parameters . for each observation , we fitted 2000 bootstrap iterations , and the 68% intervals for each parameter s distribution are quoted throughout as the @xmath27 uncertainty .",
    "this gives the projection of multi - dimensional errors that accounts for the correlations between fitting parameters . as the s / n in the observations increases towards the later epochs , the parameter uncertainties due to measurement errors become negligible and the systematic errors in the modeling dominate .",
    "in the real world , the detailed structure of sn 1987a is much more complicated than what our simple model can capture , resulting in systematic errors in the fits .",
    "we have attempted to quantify this term for the radius , which is the parameter we are most interested in .",
    "since the exact structure of the remnant is unknown , the radius measurement is always model - dependent .",
    "similar to @xcite , we fitted the 9ghz observations to various plausible models , including a spherical shell and a shell plus two point sources . in general , these fits",
    "obtain slightly different values of @xmath11 and hence the variation provides a handle of the systematic errors in the modeling .",
    "the best - fit torus parameters are listed in table  [ tab2 ] and plotted in fig .",
    "most of the fits to the atca 9ghz data are robust , except for a few epochs with very large @xmath24 values that are possibly due to poor calibration .",
    "the fits are generally better towards the late epochs , however as shown in table  [ tab2 ] , the typical reduced @xmath24 value is @xmath28 .",
    "this is still relatively large , suggesting that our model is not a perfect fit to the observations , and that there are unmodeled features in the data which contribute to the systematic residuals .",
    "this result is not unexpected since the model aims to capture only the characteristic features of the emission , rather than reproducing every small - scale structure .",
    "nevertheless , our model does provide a better description to the data than a simple thin spherical shell model used in previous studies @xcite .",
    "[ vis ] plots the visibilities of the data and models along two orthogonal axes in the @xmath8-@xmath9 domain .",
    "the difference between a torus and a spherical shell models is obvious , in particular along the @xmath8-axis , because this direction corresponds to east - west in the sky , where the radio emission shows large asymmetry .",
    "the plots clearly indicate that the asymmetric torus model is a better fit over a simple shell , and , at least to the first order , well describes the east - west asymmetry . on the other hand",
    ", we note that a similar plot with azimuthally averaged @xmath8-@xmath9 data ( fig .  6 in",
    "* ) masks the discrepancy between the data and a simple shell model . to provide a quantitative comparison between different models , we have reproduced the fits with a thin shell model and a thin spherical shell plus two points model as in @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] shows that the torus fit always provides lower @xmath29 values than the shell fit .",
    "the shell plus two points model and the torus model have comparable goodness - of - fit , but the former requires two more fitting parameters .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our torus model is a substantial improvement over the simple models used previously .",
    "although we did not attempt to provide a physical model to interpret the observed radio light curve , we note that the fluxes obtained from the fits are consistent with the values reported by @xcite . in the following discussions ,",
    "we will concentrate on the torus geometry .",
    "[ model ] shows the best - fit model for epoch 2008.0 , with the left panel illustrating the model at very high spatial resolution .",
    "the images were generated in the @xmath8-@xmath9 domain with complete uv coverage , then fourier transformed back to the image plane .",
    "the right panel shows the image convolved with a 04 fwhm gaussian , the same as the super - resolved beam used in fig .",
    "[ super ] .",
    "the inclined torus model has successfully captured the aspect ratio of the overall structure , and has also reproduced the two lobe features , thus confirming that they are due to projection of the optically thin equatorial belt .    a better way to compare between the model and data is to generate an image of the model with identical @xmath8-@xmath9 sampling as the corresponding observation .",
    "then the sampling effects will appear identically in both images , allowing a direct comparison .",
    "[ fits ] & [ 2008 ] show the images of the data compared to the best - fit models for selected epochs .",
    "the models were generated with the approach described above and then imaged using the same procedures as mentioned in  [ s2 ] .",
    "however , since the mem algorithm is not applicable to images with negative values , we did not attempt to deconvolve the residual maps .",
    "we emphasize that the residual maps presented here only illustrate a qualitative comparison between the data and the model , rather than a detailed quantitative description of the underlying difference .",
    "the most obvious feature in the residuals is the flux deficit of the model torus in the southeast and northwest , and the excess emission at the center .",
    "the discrepancies are due to limitations of our relatively simple model .",
    "as indicated by the super - resolved images , the eastern lobe in the data is not reflection symmetric about its brightest point , but extends further to the south .",
    "this can not be easily described by the model , which approximates the asymmetry by a linear gradient .",
    "although less obvious , a similar case occurs for the western lobe as well . on the other hand , the excess flux at the center of the model torus is due to the abrupt cutoff of the high latitude emission in the model . since the inclination angle @xmath16",
    "is fixed during the fit , the ellipticity depends solely on the opening angle @xmath13 .",
    "a large @xmath13 is required by the fit in order to match the overall geometry , hence resulting in excess emission filling the interior . in real life , the radio emissivity is likely to be latitude dependent and to decay smoothly at high latitude , providing a slightly different overall ellipticity .",
    "a more realistic model should incorporate all these effects to address the above discrepancies .      the best - fit model for the 18ghz observation of 2003 july",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ 12 mm ] , with the data and model visibilities plotted in fig .",
    "[ vis12 ] .",
    "the diffracted - limited images were deconvolved the clean algorithm .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fits ] & [ 2008 ] , no deconvolution has been applied to the residual map in order to avoid running the algorithm into noise .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab2 ] , the best fits have small @xmath30 , which are due to large measurement uncertainties ( see fig .",
    "[ vis12 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are plotted by the open circles in fig .",
    "they are all consistent with the 9ghz results , except that @xmath13 is slightly smaller at 18ghz .",
    "while the discrepancy in @xmath13 seems to suggest a frequency - dependent emission height that implies different physical conditions between the equatorial plane and at higher latitude , it could also be the result of systematic errors in the fits which we do not fully understand . as the remnant is getting brighter , future observations will help to investigate this problem .",
    "following @xcite , slices through the 18ghz diffraction - limited images along different p.a .",
    "were plotted in fig .",
    "[ slice ] . in general , the two peaks in the model match well to the observation .",
    "the only exception is at 150 , where the data are @xmath31 brighter than the model in the east . as discussed in ",
    "[ s41 ] above , this is attributed to the unmodeled southern extension of the lobe .",
    "the plot also illustrates the excess emission near the center of the model torus , again consistent with the 9ghz results .",
    "in general , the size of the torus is well - determined from the fits and is consistent with that determined in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the best - fit radii from the torus and shell fits are comparable , but those from the shell plus two points model are always slightly larger .",
    "a similar discrepancy was also reported by @xcite , suggesting that the radius measurement is somewhat model - dependent .",
    "the average discrepancy is @xmath32 for the later epochs , which is attributed to the systematic errors in the modeling as mentioned in  [ s32 ] . in the following discussion",
    ", we assigned a 5% systematic errors for @xmath11 .",
    "hence the quadrature sum of these and the statistical errors obtained from bootstrapping provides the total uncertainties in @xmath11 , which are shown by the dotted error flags in fig .",
    "[ plot ] .    compared to the measurements published for the x - ray shell @xcite",
    ", the radio torus is larger by 10 - 15% which is too large to be accounted for by the measurement uncertainties .",
    "however , @xcite analysed the chandra data in the fourier domain and found that the x - ray and radio shells agree to better than 1% in size .",
    "hence they argued that the discrepancy is due to different measuring techniques , rather than any physical difference . at optical wavelengths",
    ", @xcite reported that the reverse shock was located at 70% of the inner circumstellar ring around day 3900 .",
    "this gives a radius of 064 , which is slightly smaller than the torus size at that epoch . from the steady increase in the radio light curve",
    ", @xcite argued that the radio - emitting electrons could be filling the region between the shocks .",
    "although the thickness @xmath12 is not too sensitive in the fits and generally very small , this is still consistent with the prediction . with a density profile @xmath33 in the supernova ejecta @xcite",
    ", numerical simulations suggest that during the early stage of the snr evolution , the forward and reverse shocks are separated only by 10 - 20% in radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ", @xcite reported a shell thickness of 30% of the inner shell radius . despite the above results assuming a spherical symmetry ,",
    "if @xmath12 in our case is of a similar order , given that the whole remnant is barely resolved in the 9ghz observations , @xmath12 likely remains unresolved .",
    "this also supports the conclusion of @xcite that both thick and thin shell models provide equally good fits to the data .      at the earliest epoch ,",
    "the remnant has a radius of about 06 .",
    "as @xcite pointed out , this implies a minimum mean expansion rate of @xmath34 during the period 1987 to 1992 , in the free expansion phase .",
    "this expansion was then followed by a drastic deceleration to @xmath35kms@xmath1 at around the time the radio emission re - emerged @xcite . to determine the expansion since day 1800 , we employed a linear fit to @xmath11 for all the 9ghz observations and obtained an expansion velocity of @xmath36 over the period 1992 - 2008 .",
    "the small @xmath37 in the fit indicates that the measurement uncertainties are over - estimated . on the other hand ,",
    "if only the statistical errors are considered , the result is similar ( @xmath38 ) , but with smaller errors and a much larger @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite performed a quadratic fit to the remnant size and suggested an acceleration in the expansion .",
    "we also found a similar trend in our results .",
    "however , a @xmath40-test suggests that the quadratic fit is not statistically significant : there is a 20% probability that the smaller @xmath24 in the quadratic fit would occur solely by chance .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the simpler model ( i.e.  linear fit ) is preferred and adopt the linear expansion @xmath41 in the following discussion .",
    "this value lies between @xmath42 and @xmath43 obtained by @xcite and @xcite respectively using a thin shell model , and agrees with the prediction @xmath44 from hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "it is also similar to the expansion rate of the reverse shock at @xmath45 reported by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray expansion is apparently much faster before day 6200 .",
    "early measurements showed an x - ray expansion of @xmath46 @xcite , but @xcite recently suggested acceleration to a higher velocity of @xmath47 over the period covering 5000 - 6000 , before the expansion decelerates to @xmath48 near day 6200 .",
    "this could indicate that the x - ray emission is located differently as the radio emission and much closer to the forward shock .",
    "a comparison between the radio and optical observations suggests that the supernova blast wave may have started to encounter the dense csm in the past few years .",
    "the optical ring , the emission from which represents fluorescence after ionization of the csm by the supernova uv flash , indicates the inner boundary of the dense swept - up csm . as seen by the _",
    "hst _ , the central equatorial ring has a radius of 081 - 085 @xcite .",
    "accounting for the uncertainties in both the radio and optical measurements , our results suggest that the radio emission could have reached the optical inner ring around day 6000 - 6500 , hence the forward shock could have started to expand into the dense csm as early as 2004 .",
    "this falls nicely within the predictions by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but disagrees with other estimates such as those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the x - ray observations also provide evidence for the encounter . the rapid increase in the soft x - ray flux near day 6000 - 6200 @xcite and the drastic deceleration of the x - ray expansion around day 6200 @xcite",
    "reveal that the forward shock has encountered a steep gradient in the ambient density .",
    "we expect a similar deceleration in the radio expansion to occur very soon .",
    "in addition to the radius , the opening angle @xmath13 is also an important parameter that probes the csm geometry .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath13 shown in fig .  [ plot ] are substantial , indicating a significant level of radio emission from mid - latitudes .",
    "this extra - planar structure implies the spread of dense csm over large regions on either side of the equatorial plane , and suggests that the prominent optical ring is merely the densest part of a more complicated 3d structure . in the later epochs",
    ", @xmath13 stays nearly constant around 40 .",
    "this gives an inferred emission height up to @xmath49 cm from the equatorial plane .",
    "our result indicates a radio emission geometry very similar to that of the reverse shock .",
    "@xcite reported a rapid decrease of ly@xmath3 and h@xmath3 emission beyond @xmath50 and hence deduced that the reverse shock is mostly confined within @xmath51 of the equatorial plane .",
    "our fitting results also provide the characteristic structure of the csm , which can be compared to hydrodynamic simulations such as those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in those simulations ,",
    "the exact shape of the contact discontinuity between the bsg and rsg winds is highly model - dependent .",
    "some models suggest a rather constant opening angle over a large range of radius ( e.g.  fig .",
    "3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is similar to our case .",
    "nevertheless , all the simulations indicate that the overall geometry of the swept - up csm is peanut - like , with a dense equatorial ring at the waist .",
    "this picture predicts that the radio emission will extend with time to higher latitude .",
    "although the expected trend is not found in the current data , we anticipate @xmath13 to increase significantly in future observations according to the above models . eventually the shock will reach the dense csm in the polar region and the radio morphology will be more circular .",
    "our results do not show any polar protrusions as suggested by @xcite .",
    "if the forward shock continues to expand at a similar rate , it may take another 10 - 20 years to reach the polar region before we can verify these predictions . as a note , fig .",
    "[ plot ] suggests some hints that @xmath13 is slightly larger in the early epochs .",
    "if this is real , it may indicate the encounter of ejecta with dense regions at higher latitude at the early stages .",
    "along with the shock expansion , the radio emission is then gradually dominated by other regions closer to the equatorial plane , resulting in a gradual decrease in @xmath13 .",
    "the super - resolved images in fig .  [ super ] clearly show that the eastern lobe is brighter than its western counterpart .",
    "this feature has also been reported in the x - ray observations @xcite . in our torus model ,",
    "the asymmetry is quantified in terms of a linear gradient with direction @xmath21 and magnitude @xmath20 .",
    "[ plot ] shows a trend of increase in @xmath21 prior to 1998 .",
    "although this occurred at a similar time as the optical hot spots first appeared , comparing @xmath21 to the hot spot positions shows that they do not coincide .",
    "therefore we arrive the same conclusion as @xcite that the detailed morphology of radio and optical emissions are not correlated .",
    "the only similarity is that they both brightened first in the eastern half , indicating a global asymmetry along the east - west direction . on the other hand , the variation in @xmath21",
    "may be associated with the slight decrease in @xmath13 around that period .",
    "this could suggest that the blast wave has encountered different dense regions before and after @xmath52 . in the late epochs , @xmath21 stays around 110 , which corresponds to a p.a .  of 96  on the plane of the sky .",
    "this matches the bright x - ray lobes located at p.a .",
    "90  and 270  as reported by @xcite .",
    "although there were indications from earlier data that the asymmetry increases with time @xcite , the longer data span presented here does not support this . from 1995",
    "onward , @xmath20 stays at a constant level of @xmath4 .",
    "this gives a flux ratio of 1.5 between the two halves of the torus at the equatorial plane .",
    "the projection onto the plane of the sky reduces this ratio slightly .",
    "thus as seen by an observer , the eastern lobe appears to be @xmath53 times brighter than the west . in order to confirm this result , we compared to the degree of asymmetry inferred from the shell plus two points fits .",
    "the surface brightness ratio between the eastern and western lobes is listed in table  [ tab3 ] ; again this does not show any significant long - term variations , but suggests a rather constant flux ratio of about 1.3 , which is consistent with the torus estimate .",
    "hence we conclude that the surface brightness of the eastern half is consistently 30 - 40% larger than the west .",
    "this is very close to the 40% asymmetry in the reverse shock @xcite , also similar to the 15 - 50% asymmetry in the 0.3 - 6kev x - ray band @xcite .",
    "while the exact origin of the east - west asymmetry still remains unclear , it seems likely that the asymmetry either lies in the initial velocity of the ejecta , which would imply an asymmetric explosion , or in the density of the csm @xcite . in principle",
    "the evolution of the radio morphology can help distinguish these two scenarios .",
    "if the eastern lobe expands faster , it will cause a systematic shift of the torus center towards the east .",
    "unfortunately , the phase self - calibration process removes the absolute astrometric information in the data , precluding a direct comparison between epochs .",
    "nonetheless , the shell plus two points fit can provide some insights into the relative positions of the features .",
    "although this model is less preferable than the torus model , both of them obtain a comparable goodness - of - fit , therefore we believe that the former can still provide a sensible description of the location of the lobe centroids .",
    "as listed in table  [ tab3 ] , the offsets of the point sources from the shell center increase at a similar rate as the shell radius",
    ". this would not be the case if the csm were denser towards the east , since the higher density would lead to a larger deceleration for the eastern lobe .",
    "in the other scenario , if the ejecta in the east had a higher velocity , then it would arrive at the equatorial ring first and would start to decelerate .",
    "hence we expect the ratio of offsets to vary in future observations .",
    "however , we emphasize that this is only a very rough estimate . in particular , if the shell plus two points model is not a good description of the physical structure , excess flux from the lobes will shift the center of the underlying shell , introducing large systematic errors in the positions .      in spite of extensive searches in radio and optical wavelengths ,",
    "no pulsar has yet been found within the supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "our fitting scheme can also provide a detection limit on any possible central object .",
    "we applied the same fitting procedure using the torus model with a point source fixed at the center .",
    "the flux density of the point source was held fixed during the fit .",
    "we adjusted its level until the change in the best - fit @xmath24 value exceeded a certain limit . to begin with , we applied the fit to the 1996 july observation , in which the remnant has high s / n but is still not too bright to preclude a sensitive search .",
    "the fit gives a 3@xmath23 upper limit of 0.3mjy . applying the fit on several other epochs obtained very similar results .",
    "hence we conclude that this is the 3@xmath23 detection limit on any unresolved central source , including a neutron star or a compact pulsar wind nebula , for the atca observations at 9ghz . as a comparison , the most sensitive limit on pulsation at this frequency yields an upper flux limit of 0.058mjy @xcite .      among about ten resolved radio supernovae ( rsne )",

    "* ) , sn 1987a shows a very different characteristics in the asymmetry , morphology and expansion as compared to the others .",
    "for example , sn 1993j in m81 , which is the best studied rsn besides sn 1987a , was found to be circular within 3% over 7 years of vlbi observations .",
    "based on a statistical argument , @xcite suggested that the emission is intrinsically spherical . on the other hand ,",
    "only two other rsne show large deviation from a circular shell .",
    "vlbi imaging of in ngc 891 revealed a distorted shell structure with a hot spot @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested this could be due to protrusions in the progenitor s wind @xcite , or jet - induced core collapse @xcite .",
    "another example of a non - spherical rsn is in ngc 6946 .",
    "a recent study by @xcite interpreted the asymmetry as either a shell with two hot spots , which could be similar to the case of sn 1987a , or an anisotropically expanding shell with a protrusion .",
    "the main distinction between sn 1987a and other rsne lies in its rate of expansion .",
    "as discussed , the expansion of sn 1987a must have undergone a rapid deceleration in the first 1800 days .",
    "in contrast , for all other rsne with detected expansion , their sizes are well - approximated by a power - law @xmath54 , with the deceleration parameter @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the most extreme example is in m100 , which has shown nearly free expansion ( @xmath56 ) for over 22 years @xcite .",
    "the unusual morphology and evolution of sn 1987a can be largely attributed to its complex circumstellar environment .",
    "thus , this extraordinary event provides a unique example in the study of supernova shell dynamics , stellar wind interactions and stellar evolution .",
    "in this study , we have developed a scheme to model the interferometeric @xmath8-@xmath9 data for any 3d object with axisymmetric structure . an application to atca 9 and 18ghz observations of sn 1987a",
    "has improved the spatial modeling of the radio remnant . an inclined equatorial belt torus model in 3d",
    "was employed , with the incorporation of light travel time effects and of an overall east - west asymmetry .",
    "the projected brightness distribution of the model is transformed into 2d fourier space analytically , then is fit directly to the visibility data .",
    "the torus model successfully captures the characteristic features of the radio morphology and provides substantial improvements over the simple spherical shell fit used in previous studies .",
    "the best - fit torus geometry shows significant extra - planar emission extending to mid - latitudes @xmath57 , and a 40% flux difference between the eastern and western lobes .",
    "evolution of the shell radius with time implies a constant expansion rate of @xmath0kms@xmath1 over the period 1992 - 2008 covered by the observations ; the radio remnant is probably now starting to encounter the optical inner ring .",
    "our results suggest a torus geometry and expansion speed both very similar to those seen in h@xmath3 and ly@xmath3 emission , indicating that the radio synchrotron emission originates between the supernova forward and reverse shocks . in summary ,",
    "the torus fitting provides a powerful tool to probe the 3d structure of the radio emission , showing that the overall picture of the dense csm is consistent with the hydrodynamic simulation of the progenitor star s interacting winds .",
    "future evolution of the radio morphology can help differentiate between specific evolutionary histories for this system , and can address the apparent east - west asymmetry in the ejecta distribution .",

    "<S> we present detailed fourier modeling of the radio remnant of supernova 1987a , using high - resolution 9ghz and 18ghz data taken with the australia telescope compact array over the period 1992 to 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a parameterized three - dimensional torus model for the expanding radio shell , in which the emission is confined to an inclined equatorial belt ; our model also incorporates both a correction for light travel - time effects and an overall east - west gradient in the radio emissivity . by deriving an analytic expression for the two - dimensional fourier transform of the projected three - dimensional brightness distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we can fit our spatial model directly to the interferometric visibility data . </S>",
    "<S> this provides robust estimates to the radio morphology at each epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit results suggest a constant remnant expansion at @xmath0kms@xmath1 over the 16-year period covered by the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the model fits also indicate substantial mid - latitude emission , extending to @xmath2 on either side of the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> this likely corresponds to the extra - planar structure seen in h@xmath3 and ly@xmath3 emission from the supernova reverse shock , and broadly supports hydrodynamic models in which the complex circumstellar environment was produced by a progression of interacting winds from the progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> our model quantifies the clear asymmetry seen in the radio images : we find that the eastern half of the radio remnant is consistently @xmath4 brighter than the western half at all epochs , which may result from an asymmetry in the ejecta distribution between these two hemispheres . </S>"
