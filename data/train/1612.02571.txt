    "interactions of atoms with the electromagnetic field near micro and nano - scale dielectric structures is currently a topic of great interest  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , atoms in the vicinity of microscopic resonators can interact strongly with photons in the resonator leading to quantum information applications such as single photon switching  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent advances have been made in trapping arrays of atoms near the surface of nanofibers using guided modes  @xcite for which large optical densities are realizable  a feature which is also conducive to quantum information as well as more general quantum optics applications .",
    "trapping of single atoms near to nanostructure based cavities has also seen recent advances  @xcite .",

    "scattering of the diffracted beam by the fiber produces an array of traps near the fiber surface .",
    "( b ) schematic diagram showing the regions of importance for the theoretical derivation of the trapping field .",
    "a fiber of radius @xmath2 is mounted on a grating of period @xmath3 , for integer @xmath4 , depth @xmath5 and slat width @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the grating duty cycle .",
    "a @xmath8-polarized plane wave is incident on the grating from the substrate side at an angle @xmath9 .",
    "the grating diffracts the incident wave into three orders with angles @xmath10 and @xmath11 with respect to the fiber axis .",
    "these plane waves are then scattered by the fiber giving rise to a trapping field @xmath12 . ]    nonetheless , a number of challenges remain in this area .",
    "one problem is the trapping of atoms in optimum positions for coupling to nanowaveguide - based cavities  @xcite . in standard ,",
    "freespace cavity qed experiments , this problem has already been solved with applications to atomic self organization  @xcite and atomic spin squeezing  @xcite , but these methods do not translate well to the nanowaveguide case .",
    "another challenge is the vector light shift imparted on the atoms when they are trapped using the guided mode of a nanowaveguide  @xcite . as an additional matter , the observation of collective excitation effects such as superradiance using nanofibers  @xcite would be greatly simplified if the spacing of a trapping array could be decoupled from the wavelength of light used to create it .",
    "here we describe a scheme to trap atoms in arrays near to the surface of a composite nanostructure which can potentially solve these problems as well as provide new features compared to the aforementioned studies .",
    "the device we consider here is a nanostructure comprised of a nanofiber mounted on a grating .",
    "similar devices have recently been experimentally investigated for the purposes of enhancing the coupling of a quantum emitter to the guided modes of an optical nanofiber  @xcite . here",
    ", we will show that by illuminating such a device , it is possible to create periodic arrays of trapping potentials near to the nanofiber surface as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) .",
    "the basic principle of the device is that a longer period grating ( referred to here as a _ trapping grating _ ) between two bragg gratings on a nanostructured silica substrate can serve the dual purposes of 1 ) enhancing emission into the integrated nanofiber by acting as a cavity and 2 ) acting as a first order grating for trapping light which illuminates the device .",
    "the principle advantages of the proposed device are as follows : a ) an array of traps can be formed along the nanofiber surface , with the number of traps and their period determined by the design of the nano - structured substrate , rather than the wavelength of the trapping light . a major application of this ,",
    "as we will show later , is trapping devices where the trapping sites are _ geometrically guaranteed _ to have their centers aligned to antinodes of a cavity mode of the device .",
    "b ) unlike trapping schemes which use the evanescent tails of the guided modes , in our scheme no trapping light is present in the guided mode , which should lead to improved signal - to - noise ratios for detection of photons emitted into the guided mode .",
    "c ) unlike trapping arrays formed by the guided modes of the nanofiber , the traps formed by this technique have linear rather than elliptical polarization .",
    "this means the potentially decohering effect of vector light shifts  @xcite is not present for our device .",
    "d ) the composite nature of the device has a number of benefits as given in  @xcite .",
    "of particular importance in this instance is the separation of the nanowaveguide function and the index modulation function into separate devices .",
    "this allows for much greater diffraction efficiencies into the @xmath13st order compared to what could be achieved with structures patterned directly onto the waveguide , leading to relatively larger trapping depths along the fiber axis .",
    "the paper proceeds in the following way .",
    "first we consider the trapping potential formed when a plane wave is incident on the system with an infinitely long trapping grating and no bragg - grating region , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) .",
    "this system may be analysed both numerically and using an analytical model which allows a crosscheck of the numerically calculated potential .",
    "having established the validity of our numerics , we then go on to simulate the full device , including the bragg mirror regions , using fdtd simulations .",
    "the device is depicted in a to - scale conceptual image in fig .  [",

    "an optical nanofiber of radius @xmath2 is mounted on a nano - structured substrate and illuminated from the grating side ( single - illumination configuration ) or from both sides ( dual - illumination configuration ) by a red - detuned laser beam with a vacuum wavelength @xmath14 .",
    "the corresponding wave number of the trapping laser is @xmath15 and the trapping laser frequency is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the speed of light in the vacuum .",
    "the nano - structured substrate is divided into two regions . to either side of the center ,",
    "a bragg grating region is present .",
    "the two bragg gratings , which have period @xmath18 act as mirrors with respect to the fundamental mode of the nanofiber  @xcite .",
    "the central region is the trapping grating ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) ) with period @xmath19 for some real number @xmath4 , i.e. , the trapping grating is a first order grating relative to the incident trapping light .",
    "we characterize the length of the trapping region by counting the number of regions @xmath20 of width @xmath3 . in this paper , @xmath20 is always an odd number .",
    "we note that with respect to the bragg mirrors , the central trapping grating region may be considered to constitute a cavity of total width @xmath21 .",
    "this cavity region acts to enhance coupling of spontaneous emission to the fiber guided modes .    in all regions of the nano - structured substrate , the grating slats have depth @xmath22 m and width @xmath23 nm , where @xmath7 is the bragg grating duty cycle . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) , light incident on the device at angle @xmath9 is diffracted into the @xmath24th and @xmath13st orders at angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively . in the remainder of the paper , we will take @xmath27 implying that the light is normally incident on the grating substrate .",
    "we define our axes so that @xmath28 is always in the middle of the trapping grating region and @xmath29 corresponds to the fiber center as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined to lie along the @xmath33 , @xmath8 and @xmath34 axes respectively . in the analytical treatment which follows below , we will only consider the case of normally incident , @xmath8-polarized trapping light which is red - detuned from the atomic resonance .",
    "the effect of changing the incident angle , polarization or detuning will be discussed in the discussion section .",
    "by applying the theory of a planewave scattered from a dielectric grating  @xcite together with scattering theory for a sub - wavelength dimension cylinder  @xcite the field outside the device for the incident @xmath8-polarized field can be found .",
    "a detailed derivation is given in the appendix .",
    "to summarize the theoretical approach : we make the approximation that evanescent orders of the grating may be ignored , thereby truncating the series which gives the output field .",
    "we also assume that the field around the nanofiber can be found by taking the field at the output of the grating as the input field to the scattering problem involving the nanofiber . to find the field around the fiber we need to find the scattered field due to the @xmath24th and @xmath13st order plane waves .",
    "to apply the standard scattering formalism , we first evaluate the angles @xmath35 where @xmath36 as shown in fig .",

    "these coefficients are defined fully in the appendix , where a brief review of scattering theory for a dielectric cylinder is given for the case considered here .      in the dual illumination scheme , a second laser illuminates the device from the fiber side . to derive the trapping field in this case",
    ", we will assume that the only fields to be considered are those of the second trapping laser itself , and the scattered field caused by the second trapping laser being incident on the nanofiber .",
    "that is , we ignore any reflections from the grating or , indeed , any effects due to the grating at all . because of the low reflectivity of the grating at the wavelength considered here , this approximation is not a bad one . in particular , for the space @xmath42 , the assumption turns out to produce good agreement with fdtd simulation results .",
    "the incident field is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the relative phase between trapping laser 1 and trapping laser 2 which we will assume is adjustable .",
    "the scattered field is then @xmath54 where the sign of @xmath33 in the argument of the spherical harmonics @xmath47 has been flipped to account for the fact that the incident wave is coming from the negative @xmath33 direction , and the terms in @xmath48 are zero due to the normal incidence of the second trapping beam . finally , we may write the field due to illumination by both trapping beams 1 and 2 as @xmath55    note that in what follows , we will use @xmath12 to denote either the trapping potential for single or dual illumination .",
    "the meaning of @xmath12 will always be clear from the context in which it is used .      to calculate the trapping potential experienced by @xmath56cs atoms , we follow closely the formalism of ref .",
    "the optical trapping potential may be calculated as @xmath57 where @xmath58 the index @xmath59 runs over different transitions of cesium that contribute to the trapping potential . for our purposes",

    "this flat potential approaches the van der waals potential due to a silica fiber when the distance from the fiber surface approaches zero  @xcite .",
    "the van der waals potential due to the grating is neglected as the trapping potential minima always lie between two grating slats , i.e. , @xmath87 nm away from the nearest slat for the parameters used in this paper .",
    "this is sufficiently far that the contribution from the grating slats to the van der waals potential is negligible .",

    "[ fig : gaussillumsingle](e - g ) and  [ fig : gaussillumdouble](d - f ) respectively . as expected , we find essentially no change along the @xmath8-axis , and the change along the @xmath34-axis is small",
    ". however the @xmath33 axis value is more than quadrupled due to the tighter trap created by the standing wave as well as the closer proximity of the trap to the fiber surface .",
    "we now consider aspects of our system not discussed in the preceding sections .",
    "first the question arises as to our choice of parameters for the trapping light . regarding blue detuned trapping schemes ,",
    "because the focusing effect of the nanofiber determines the distance of the trapping potential minimum from the fiber surface and the focus is always an intensity maximum , trapping sites tend to be further from the nanofiber in the blue detuned case .",
    "we also calculated the potential at the blue - detuned magic wavelength of 686 nm , but we found that red - detuned trapping light produced traps closer to the nanofiber surface .",
    "as for the polarization of the trapping beam , in this work we used exclusively @xmath8 polarized light .",
    "this polarization is parallel to the grating slats , so that the output polarization of the grating is also @xmath107polarized . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath107 polarized illumination of the nanofiber produces a field which includes localized @xmath108polarized components at azimuthal angles of @xmath109 on the fiber surface .",
    "nonetheless , we found that the polarization of the trapping field is also @xmath8-polarized near the trapping minima to a good approximation , with less than @xmath110 @xmath108polarization at the trap center , and slightly less than @xmath111 @xmath108 polarized at 300 nm away from the trap center in the @xmath107direction ( corresponding to a temperature of @xmath112 mk ) .",
    "additionally , we found that illuminating the device with @xmath34-polarized light did not produce trapping potentials due to the mixture of polarizations resulting after diffraction by the grating .",
    "next , we note that in the case of non - normal incidence , a diffraction pattern ( and thus a trap ) is only produced if the incident angle @xmath113 .",
    "this is because the gratings considered here are strictly first order gratings .",
    "this means that the device must be precisely aligned in order to produce a trapping potential .",
    "additionally , here we have principally considered the trapping sites closest to the fiber surface .",
    "this is justified by the exponential scaling of the coupling between a dipole emitter and the fiber guided mode , atoms trapped in more distant trapping sites have negligible coupling to the nanofiber  @xcite .",
    "another issue to consider in the present scheme is the possibility that large light intensities might affect the integrity of the very thin silica slats on the grating .",
    "however , the slats are at intensity nodes of the trapping field for the cases considered here . additionally , the trapping intensity produced by the interference of diffracted orders of the grating is only of order twice the input intensity . for these reasons the thin grating slats are not in general exposed to large field intensities .",
    "lastly , we consider issues related to the tuning of the cavity .",
    "illumination of the device may cause thermal expansion and thus drifting of the cavity mode from its design wavelength .",
    "we note , however , that much of the optical power for circular beam illumination is unused , due to the thinness of the nanofiber .",
    "if , for example , we used an elliptical beam with a @xmath34-axis radius of 10 @xmath86 m as before but an @xmath8-axis radius of only 1 @xmath86 m , the optical power required to achieve the same intensity at the device surface would be only @xmath111 of that necessary in the case of a circular beam ( i.e. @xmath114 mw ) . in this way heating of the silica substrate would be drastically reduced .",
    "if tuning of the cavity resonance is required , it can be achieved by slightly rotating the nanofiber relative to the grating slats ( increasing the resonance wavelength ) or by lifting the fiber slightly off the grating substrate ( reducing the resonance wavelength ) .    in conclusion , we have analytically and numerically investigated trapping atoms close to the surface of a composite nanooptical device consisting of an optical nanofiber mounted on a grating .",
    "illumination of the device from the grating side produces an array of traps with separations from the nanofiber surface down to 200 nm . adding illumination from the fiber side",
    "can produce trapping potentials within 100 nm of the nanofiber surface .",
    "bragg gratings to either side of the trapping grating create a cavity enhancing the coupling of spontaneous emission into the nanofiber guided modes , and by appropriately designing the grating structure , arrays of atoms may be trapped at positions which correspond to antinodes of the cavity mode .",
    "because optical nanofibers offer automatic coupling to standard fiber optical networks , and due to the advantages of the present scheme over existing nanofiber trapping schemes , we expect that it may be useful in a variety of situations .",
    "these include the realization of collectively enhanced scattering into the nanofiber guided modes from an array of atoms , through to quantum information applications where distant atoms must be coupled to the same cavity mode .",

    ", care must be taken in interpreting the results since artifacts of the fdtd method can form regular periodic intensity maxima of a similar nature to the true trapping maxima we wish to find .",
    "we used periodic boundary conditions for these simulations to ensure that no edge - effects due to the fdtd boundary conditions were present .",
    "we also checked that removing all structures in the simulation gave rise to a flat intensity profile , and that removing the grating structure led to the disappearance of all @xmath34-periodic structures in the output intensity pattern .",
    "once these checks had been passed , we could be confident that any local intensity maxima in the simulations corresponded to the physical nature of the scattered field rather than numerical artifacts .",

    "we now review the analytical form of the field created when a plane wave is incident on a dielectric cylinder at oblique incidence with angle @xmath143 .",
    "the treatment follows exactly that of ref .",
    "@xcite and is included here only for convenience , not as a new result of our study .",
    "the following results are valid for the case where the propagation vector @xmath144 of the incident wave lies in the @xmath92 plane and the polarization is parallel to the @xmath8 axis .",
    "we first define cylindrical coordinates for our system .",
    "the azimuthal coordinate @xmath145 is given by @xmath146 , and the radial coordinate is given by @xmath147 .",
    "for the cylindrical unit vectors , we define @xmath148 , the radial unit vector , and @xmath149 , the azimuthal unit vector .",
    "to proceed , we introduce the vector cylindrical harmonics which are given by the following formulae :    @xmath150,\\ ] ]    @xmath151,\\ ] ]    where @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 is the @xmath49th order hankel function .",
    "note that although the arguments to the cylindrical harmonics are given as cartesian coordinates , calculations take place in polar coordinates .",
    "the field scattered by the cylinder can now be written as @xmath155,\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined as follows .",
    "@xmath156 @xmath157    the @xmath49 dependent coefficients have the following defintions : @xmath158,\\ ] ] @xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161,\\ ] ] @xmath162,\\ ] ] where @xmath163 , and @xmath164",
    ".    finally , the total field is found by adding the incident field @xmath165 to the scattered field , i.e. @xmath166",
    "we can now write down the formula for the electric field outside the device as used in our manuscript . we will approximate this field by the output field of the grating as scattered by the nanofiber .",
    "noting that @xmath50 and @xmath51 depend on the incident angle @xmath143 , we write @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "then , by applying eq .  [ eq : etot ] along with eq .",
    "[ eq : escat ] for each diffraction order of the grating , we can write the field outside the device in the region @xmath42 for the case of single illumination as @xmath169.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    99 h.j .",
