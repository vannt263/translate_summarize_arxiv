    "the period - luminosity relation ( plr ) of miras has been widely used as a distance indicator , such as measuring distances to nearby galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we can also investigate the distribution of miras in the galaxy using the plr .",
    "their important advantage as tracers is that we can obtain a position of each mira @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we present results of our near - ir survey of miras towards the gc .",
    "glass and collaborators @xcite conducted a k - band ( 2.2  @xmath6 m ) survey for almost the same region as ours and detected 409 long - period variables .",
    "our survey is deeper by more than one magnitude and , more importantly , includes the simultaneous monitoring in @xmath7 ( 1.25  @xmath6 m ) and @xmath2 ( 1.63  @xmath6 m ) as well as @xmath3 ( 2.14  @xmath6 m ) .",
    "we carried out a variability survey for a field of view of 20@xmath0 by 30@xmath0 towards the gc using the irsf 1.4-m telescope and the sirius near - ir camera sited at saao , sutherland , south africa .",
    "roughly 90 monitoring data were collected between 2001 and 2008 .",
    "the detection limit is approximately 16.4 , 14.5 and 13.1  mag in @xmath7 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we detected more than 80,000 sources in our field of view , and we found variations of 1,364 stars .",
    "we identified the counterparts of 347 variables in the catalogue of glass et al .",
    "then we found periods for more than 500 variables , a majority of which are considered to be miras .",
    "the catalogue of variable stars and their time - series magnitudes will be released in our paper which has been accepted for mnras @xcite .",
    "]    we make use of miras in the lmc to calibrate the plr .",
    "134 miras in the lmc were selected based on their amplitudes , periods , and colors so as to include oxygen - rich miras in the period range of 100350  days ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lmcplr ] ) .",
    "the period limit is used to exclude objects with thick circumstellar dust and hot - bottom burning stars .",
    "the data were taken from the catalogue in @xcite .",
    "the residual scatter around the obtained plr , the line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmcplr ] , is less in @xmath3 ( 0.17  mag ) than in @xmath7 and @xmath2 ( 0.19  mag both ) , but the differences are small .",
    "this indicates that the plr in @xmath7 and @xmath2 can also be useful for distance estimation .",
    "more importantly , one can also estimate the amount of interstellar extinction by using the plr in two or more bands .",
    "we assume that the distance modulus of the lmc is 18.45  mag .",
    "the random error in estimating distances of individual miras is around 0.2  mag and the systematic error is around 0.11  mag .",
    "these uncertainties will be discussed in the forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "while @xmath7-band magnitudes are often unavailable for our objects because of the large extinction , @xmath2- and @xmath3-band magnitudes are obtained for 143 miras and we obtained their distance moduli @xmath8 and extinctions @xmath9 .",
    "we estimate the distance to the gc based on 100 miras which have values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 to exclude the selection bias . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitdm ] , the distribution is well fitted with a gaussian function . thus @xmath12 is estimated at @xmath13  mag including the systematic error .",
    "the statistical error is small while the systematic one is significant .",
    "this result agrees with recent results ( e.g. @xcite ) within the uncertainty .",
    "values obtained .",
    "the error bar indicates the size of the poisson noise ( @xmath14 ) for each bin . the mean value and width of the fitted gaussian",
    "are indicated in the panel .",
    "[ fig : fitdm ] ]",
    "because we can estimate distances and extinctions for individual miras , they can be used as tracers to reveal three - dimensional structure .",
    "it is possible to study how the extinction changes with distance along various lines of sight , although the low space density of miras may prevent us from investigating small structures .    in spite",
    "that our objects are located at the same distance , the obtained extinctions cover a large range ; from 1.5  mag to larger than 4  mag in @xmath9 except towards the thicker dark nebulae .",
    "it also varies in a complicated way with the line of sight . in fig .",
    "[ fig : akchart ] , we plot the locations of the miras with extinction values in the galactic coordinate .",
    "the sizes of the symbols vary according to @xmath9 as indicated .",
    "we have confirmed a method for obtaining distances and extinctions for miras with periods between 100 and 350  d by making use of their plr .",
    "the technique depends on knowing mean magnitudes in two or more filters in the near infrared .",
    "we estimated the distance of the gc to be @xmath15  kpc .",
    "the plr of miras is shown to be a powerful tool for studying galactic structure , although there remains a significant systematic error .",
    "it is expected that better calibrations of the plr will improve the accuracy of the method ; this may be achieved by parallax projects such as vera and gaia .",
