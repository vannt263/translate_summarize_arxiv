    "<S> the quantum state of the photon pair generated from type - ii spontaneous parametric down - conversion pumped by a ultrafast laser pulse exhibits strong decoherence in its polarization entanglement , an effect which can be attributed to the clock effect of the pump pulse or , equivalently , to distinguishing spectral information in the two - photon state . here , we propose novel temporal and spectral engineering techniques to eliminate these detrimental decoherence effects . the temporal engineering of the two - photon wavefunction results in a universal bell - state synthesizer that is independent of the choice of pump source , crystal parameters , wavelengths of the interacting photons , and the bandwidth of the spectral filter . in the spectral engineering technique , </S>",
    "<S> the distinguishing spectral features of the two - photon state are eliminated through modifications to the two - photon source . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , spectral engineering also provides a means for the generation of polarization - entangled states with novel spectral characteristics : the frequency - correlated state and the frequency - uncorrelated state . </S>"
