    "in these notes , we clarify the rle played by certain pseudo - scalar fields related to `` axions '' in some transport- or pumping processes in semiconductor devices and in the early universe .",
    "these processes are similar to ones observed in quantum hall systems .",
    "we therefore start by recalling some key features of the theory of the quantum hall effect .",
    "we then consider transport processes in very long , narrow rectangular hall samples with constrictions , as shown in figure [ fig : constriction ] .",
    ".2 in    for samples of this kind , filled with an incompressible hall fluid , the component , @xmath8 , of the electromagnetic vector potential , @xmath9 , parallel to the short axis , @xmath10 , of the sample can be interpreted as a pseudo - scalar field analogous to the _ axion _ known from elemantary particle physics @xcite . in the region where the sample has a constriction , _ tunnelling processes _ between the chiral edge modes on the upper and lower edge of the sample",
    "may occur .",
    "it is interesting to consider the effect of turning on a time - dependent voltage drop in the @xmath10-direction .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that when such a voltage drop , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 is turned on , an electric charge @xmath13 proportional to @xmath14 is transported through the constriction from the left , @xmath15 , to the right , @xmath16 .",
    "this system thus realizes a simple `` _ _ quantum pump _ _ '' . due to the tunnelling processes between edge states of opposite chirality , the state of the pump exhibits a periodicity in @xmath14 proportional to the inverse electric charge of the charge carriers in the sample",
    "thus , such a pump can be used , in principle , to explore properties of the quasi particles in incompressible quantum hall fluids , such as their electric charges , @xcite .",
    "our model can also be used to describe quantum wires carrying a luttinger liquid .",
    "the rle of the constriction is then played by impurities mixing left and right movers .",
    "we then proceed to studying a five - dimensional analogue of the quantum hall effect .",
    "if four - dimensional physics is described by dimensional reduction from a five - dimensional slab to two parallel boundary `` 3-branes '' , the axion can be interpreted as the component of the five - dimensional electromagnetic vector potential transversal to the branes .",
    "tunnelling of chiral fermions from one to the other brane , due e.g. to a mass term , generates a periodic axion potential .",
    "it is then argued that the dynamics of the axion may trigger the growth of large - scale primeval magnetic fields in the early universe .",
    "in other words , axion dynamics - which is coupled to the dynamics of the curvature tensor of space - time - can be viewed as a realization of a quantum - field theoretical `` pump '' driving the growth of large - scale primeval magnetic fields , @xcite@xcite@xcite ; see also @xcite . whether this mechanism plays a rle in explaining",
    "the observed large - scale magnetic fields in the universe is , however , still uncertain ; see @xcite .",
    "we consider a uniform @xmath10-dimensional electron gas of density @xmath17 forming at the interface between a semiconductor and an insulator when a gate voltage is applied in the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
