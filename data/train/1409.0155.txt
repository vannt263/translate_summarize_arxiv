    "elastic micro - capsules are ubiquitous in nature , appearing in the form of seeds , eggs , cells and similar .",
    "the elasticity of the cells plays an important role for their proper biological functioning . as examples , red blood cells ( rbc )",
    "deform significantly in micro vessels to ease oxygen transportation ; leukocytes squeeze through small gaps into the endothelial cell wall during inflammation  @xcite so as tumor cells do in tumor metastasis  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "artificial micro - capsules are commonly used in the food and cosmetic industry for a controlled release of ingredients  @xcite and synthetic nano - capsules promise a precise and targeted drug delivery .",
    "the ability of biological and artificial capsules to dynamically adapt , change their shapes and withstand stresses from the surrounding medium has thus attracted remarkable attention from research groups in different fields .    in micro - fluidic applications ,",
    "one of the most fundamental issues is the behaviour of these tiny deformable structures when interacting with an external applied flow .",
    "early experimental studies discovered several interesting features of rbcs : the well - known tank - treading and tumbling motion in shear flow  @xcite , parachute shaped deformation  @xcite and the zipper flow pattern  @xcite in the micro - capillaries .",
    "these observations show that the capsule shape is not given _ a priori _ but determined by the dynamic balance of interfacial forces with fluid stresses .",
    "several analytical studies deal with unbounded domains to model of tank - treading and tumbling motions of an initially spherical capsule by asymptotic analysis  @xcite ; prove the existence of slipper shaped cells in capillary flows  @xcite ; predict of the vacillating - breathing behaviour of a vesicle @xcite and the swinging - tumbling transition of a capsule  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have been successfully used to solve the associated nonlinear fluid - structure problem ; examples are the deformation of spherical  @xcite , elliptical  @xcite or rbc - shaped @xcite capsules in an unbounded shear flow . however , in a realistic situation , biological cells and artificial capsules are convected in bounded channels or ducts . motivated by early experiments showing the migration of rbcs towards the pipe centre @xcite , @xcite and @xcite simulated the axisymmetric cellular flow in a cylindrical tube using the finite element method ( fem ) .",
    "simulations based on boundary integral method ( bim ) , combined with fem for the membrane dynamics , were performed to study capsules tightly squeezed in tubes and square ducts  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "simulations have also addressed complex phenomena like the migration and slipper - shaped deformation of cells  @xcite , suspensions of rbcs in a capillary tube  @xcite , and the shape transition between nonaxisymmetric and axisymmetric rbcs  @xcite .",
    "inertial effects on the cell migration have also been investigated numerically @xcite .",
    "these previous computational studies focus on the capsule motion in straight geometries .",
    "nevertheless , capsules are seldom transported in such simple configurations , but rather in highly complicated capillary networks as in the _ in - vivo _ micro - recirculation for rbcs or through micro - fluidic devices , where corrugations , bifurcations and corners are common .",
    "less is known about the dynamics of capsules in these complex geometries , although these are attracting growing interest thanks to potential biomedical applications .",
    "experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite have shown rich behaviours of rbcs and vesicles going through sawtooth - shaped channels ; a transition from shape oscillations to orientational oscillations was identified for such deformable micro - objects , depending on the flow rate and confinement .",
    "two - dimensional fem computations have been carried out by  @xcite to examine the cell partitioning in small vessel bifurcations , showing that the cells preferentially enter the branch with higher flow rate ; such an effect is intensified by the cell migration towards the centre and hindered by obstructions near the bifurcations .",
    "@xcite report two - dimensional simulations of a capsule in a pressure - driven channel with a side branch .",
    "these authors found that the capsule deformation strongly depends on the branch angle and the cells selected different paths at the branch junction according to their deformability .",
    "recently , @xcite used the spectral boundary element method to investigate the deformation of capsules and droplets passing through a sharp constriction in a square duct .",
    "these authors examine the effect of the viscosity ratio on the non - tank - treading capsule dynamics and investigate the flow circulation inside the capsule .",
    "the flow passing around a corner is one of the most basic flow configurations ; despite its universality in biological systems and micro - fluidic devices , its influence on deformable micro - objects is not fully understood .",
    "steps in this direction have been taken only recently : the experiments by @xcite have revealed the rapid formation of bacterial streamers near the corners of a curved microchannel at low reynolds number due to the local vortical flow structure .",
    "this secondary flow appears as long as the curvature of the boundary varies , even in the inertialess stokes flow  @xcite .",
    "simulations of an elastic filament in a two - dimensional corner flow  @xcite show that the filament crosses over the curved streamlines in the corner , instead of aligning with the flow as in a rectilinear flow .",
    "one of the motivations of the work is to assess whether the corner flow can be used to infer the material properties of soft particles as done by @xcite . in these investigations , the equilibrium shape of capsules moving at a constant speed in confined channels or tubes",
    "is compared with that obtained from simulations or theory . as the corner flow is characterized by spatial non - uniformity , the capsule dynamics will undergo a transient evolution that may therefore provide additional information on the membrane properties such as viscoelasticity .",
    "knowledge of the capsule behaviour in spatially developing flows may therefore help to explore the material properties of soft capsules .    in this work",
    ", we numerically study the motion and deformation of an individual capsule transported in a duct with a straight and/or a curved corner .",
    "a three - dimensional code is developed to compute the motion of deformable capsules in arbitrary configurations .",
    "this is based on a boundary integral formulation with ewald acceleration as suggested by @xcite ; the method shares the elegance of both boundary integral and mesh - based methods .",
    "boundary integrals are computed to accurately account for the singular and fast - varying interactions while the smooth part of the solution is handled by a highly - parallel general stokes solver based on the spectral element method .",
    "the integration on the membrane is based on a global spectral surface interpolation using spherical harmonics  @xcite .",
    "our hybrid scheme couples therefore the high accuracy of boundary integrals for the short - ranged interactions to the geometrical flexibility of mesh - based methods  @xcite .",
    "spherical harmonics are utilized to resolve the membrane dynamics with spectral accuracy .",
    "the same implementation has been used to simulate cell sorting by deformability in a micro - fluidic device of complex geometry , i.e.  a semi - cylindrical pillar embedded in a divergent channel @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the geometrical setup and the numerical method",
    "are described in section  [ setup_method ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ results ] whereas their discussion and a summary of the main conclusions is provided in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : mesh_fd_cl ] displays the flow configuration and the coordinate system used in the present investigation , where half of the flow domain is removed to better visualize the deforming capsule .",
    "we investigate the motion of an elastic capsule transported through a square duct of width @xmath0 ; we keep @xmath1 in this work . in the figure ,",
    "the streaklines and colour contours , coded by the velocity magnitude , are shown on the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , omitted hereinafter ) mid - plane .",
    "the duct is characterized by a @xmath4 degree straight corner .",
    "we consider an initially spherical capsule of radius @xmath5 , enclosed by an infinitely thin hyperelastic membrane with surface shear modulus @xmath6 .",
    "the fluid inside and outside the capsule has the same density @xmath7 and viscosity @xmath8 , buoyancy forces and sedimentation effects are neglected .",
    "as capsules are usually small , the reynolds number @xmath9 defined with the capsule radius @xmath5 and the characteristic flow velocity @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "viscous forces are therefore dominant over inertial forces , and the flow inside and outside the capsule is governed by the linear stokes equations and determined instantaneously by the boundary conditions . a proper tool to solve the problem is therefore the boundary integral method ( bim ) and we adopt here an accelerated variant of it .",
    "the fluid - structure interaction problem is solved as follows : the flow convects and distorts the capsule while the restoring elastic forces alter the fluid motion  @xcite .",
    "we start with an undeformed capsule near the inflow and compute , at each time step , the elastic force on the membrane from the deformed ( and out - of - equilibrium ) shape of the capsule . neglecting inertia and brownian fluctuations , the force density exerted by the capsule onto the fluid",
    "is equal to the membrane load . given this forcing , the velocities of the membrane nodes",
    "are computed explicitly with the bim ( see the following section ) .",
    "we develop a boundary integral implementation accelerated by the general geometry ewald like method ( ggem ) , proposed by  @xcite and later on used in a variety of micro - multiphase simulations  @xcite .",
    "an introduction is given here , the readers are referred to the above - mentioned articles for more details .",
    "the surface of the capsule @xmath12 is discretized by @xmath13 points , the lagrangian mesh points .",
    "the elastic force per unit area on the membrane out of equilibrium is denoted @xmath14 .",
    "the force per unit area from the fluid to the membrane is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 due to the stress continuity . in return",
    ", the force per unit volume exerted by the deforming surface onto the fluid at position @xmath17 is @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the dirac delta function .",
    "we thus need to solve the following equations for the fluid in the inertialess stokes regime @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the pressure and fluid velocity and @xmath8 is the fluid dynamic viscosity . owing to the linearity of the stokes problem , the flow field can be expressed as a boundary integral on the surface of the capsule only , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the velocity field of the undisturbed flow and @xmath25 is the free - space green s function of the stokes problem , also known as the stokeslet or _ oseen - burgers _ tensor , @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the ggem method decomposes the force per unit volume @xmath28 into a local part @xmath29 and a global part @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ds \\bxmpp,\\nonumber\\\\ \\brhog \\bxpp & = \\int_{s}\\bfe \\bxmpp   g\\lp \\bx - \\bxm \\rp   ds \\bxmpp,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a quasi - gaussian function used to smoothen the dirac delta function , @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 indicates the length scale over which the smoothing is active .    the stokes problem in eq .",
    "[ eq : stokes ] is therefore decomposed into two problems : one for the flow induced by the local force @xmath29 hence called the local problem and one for its global counterpart @xmath30 . the velocity field @xmath36 is the sum of the local velocity @xmath37 and global velocity @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the local problem accounts for the singular and short - ranged interaction while the global problem for the smooth and long - ranged interactions .",
    "these are solved by different numerical methods ; the local solution is calculated by the boundary integral method due to its superior accuracy in resolving fast - decaying interactions , while the global problem is handled by a mesh - based solver that provides geometrical flexibility .",
    "the modified stokeslet pertaining the local problem can be shown to be @xmath40 so that the velocity field @xmath41 of the local solution can be obtained as @xmath42 eq .",
    "( [ eq : velloc_int ] ) can be integrated by classical boundary integral implementations .",
    "regularised stokeslets can be used to facilitate the calculations , as done among others in  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the bim with regularisation suffers a degradation of the numerical accuracy and robustness for cases involving strong confinement or closely packed objects .",
    "singular and nearly - singular integration is necessary to achieve the required accuracy in these cases  @xcite , and this is the approach pursued here .",
    "the modified stokeslet @xmath43 is valid for an unbounded domain , thus the local velocity @xmath41 does not account for the influence of any additional boundaries .",
    "the global velocity will therefore be defined in such a way that the sum of the two will satisfy the required boundary conditions , no slip at the solid wall @xmath44 in the cases investigated here , @xmath45 .",
    "the global problem amounts to solving the stokes problem in the domain of interest with the known volume forcing @xmath46 and boundary conditions defined by the solution of the local problem .",
    "this allows the use of a variety of efficient and accurate numerical methods for the solution of the stokes equations in any complex geometry . here , we compute the global solution with stokes module of the open - source navier - stokes solver nek5000  @xcite , using the spectral element method .",
    "nek5000 has been extensively used for stability analysis  @xcite and turbulent flows  @xcite in complex domains .",
    "as akin to fem , the physical domain is decomposed into elements with each element subdivided into arrays of gauss - lobatto - legendre ( gll ) nodes for the velocity and gauss - legendre ( gl ) nodes for the pressure field .",
    "the galerkin approximation is employed for the spatial discretization with different velocity and pressure spaces , the so - called @xmath47 approach  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the velocity ( respectively pressure ) space consists of @xmath48 ( respectively  @xmath49 ) order lagrange polynomial interpolants , defined on the gll ( respectively gl ) quadrature points in each element . note that we do not solve the navier - stokes equations with a very small but finite reynolds number , but instead use the steady stokes solver of nek5000 at each time step .",
    "nek5000 is chosen here for its spectral accuracy , high parallel performance and most importantly its geometric flexibility , fully exploiting the general - geometry merit of ggem .",
    "the global problem is solved only on the eulerian mesh points , which do not necessarily coincide with the lagrangian mesh points on the membrane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mesh_fd_cl ] ) .",
    "thus , at each time step , an interpolation from the global solution is performed to obtain the global velocity @xmath50 of the lagrangian points .",
    "the interpolation error is minimized thanks to the spectral accuracy of nek5000 .",
    "the velocities of the lagrangian points are obtained by summing up the local and global velocities .",
    "we use a third - order adam - bashforth time - integration scheme to update the position of those points .    in our work , we choose @xmath51 and @xmath52 as in the work of  @xcite .",
    "the alternative value @xmath53 has also been tested for some of the cases and no significant differences have been observed .",
    "the membrane loading was calculated as linear piece - wise functions on triangular meshes by  @xcite among others .",
    "fem has been also implemented by @xcite for its generality and versatility .",
    "bi - cubic b - splines interpolation functions are adopted by  @xcite to obtain accurate results at a reasonably high computational cost .",
    "alternatively , an accurate spectral boundary element algorithm is used by  @xcite , thus coupling the numerical accuracy of the spectral method and the geometric flexibility of the boundary element method .",
    "another attractive alternative is the global spectral method .",
    "fourier spectral interpolation and spherical harmonics are used for two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional simulations @xcite .",
    "here , we follow the approach of @xcite , briefly outlined below .",
    "we map the capsule surface onto the surface of the unit reference sphere @xmath54 , using its spherical angles @xmath55 for the parametrisation .",

    "all other surface quantities are defined on the same mesh .",

    "the corresponding normalised legendre polynomials are @xmath62 both forward and backward transformations are calculated with the spherepack library  @xcite .",

    "luckily , we found the influence by varying @xmath137 is much weaker than that by varying the capillary number @xmath135 .",
    "indeed , @xmath137 represents the relative strength of bending over shearing and its variation from @xmath157 to @xmath158 accounts for only @xmath159 of the shear modulus .",

    "we also mark and trace the four apices of the capsule from the equilibrium shape . for @xmath172 ,",
    "we identify a clear rotation by comparing the initial and final positions of the apices .",
    "the front and rear apices initially on @xmath165 , follow trajectories ( indicated by filled and hollow diamonds respectively ) deviating from @xmath165 significantly ; the front / rear apex drifts towards the outer / inner corner , eventually remaining above / below the centroid trajectory .",
    "the left / right apex starts from the same vertical position and approximately moves along the streakline @xmath168/@xmath171 .",
    "these are characterised by a decreasing / increasing velocity around the corner ( see figure  [ fig : streamline_background ] ) ; as a result , the right apex travels beyond the left , as shown in figure  [ fig : duct_v_ca_profile ] .",
    "the material points on the capsule rotate therefore in the anti - clockwise direction .",
    "this rotation is induced by the flow near the corner : this is spatially nonuniform across the duct and the material points near the inner / outer corner are advected by the accelerating / decelerating flow , which result in a net membrane rotation . in the case of @xmath174 ,",
    "the membrane rotation is not as clear .",
    "compared to the case with @xmath172 , the right apex is closer to the wall where the underlying flow is slower , thus compensating the increase of the fluid velocity near the corner .",
    "hence , the left and right apices are roughly found at the same streamwise location downstream of the corner .",
    "the velocity of the capsule centre , @xmath175 , scaled by the mean velocity @xmath10 is reported in figure  [ fig : duct_vel_ca_noscaled ] as a function of time ; the same quantity instead divided by the equilibrium velocity @xmath176 , is depicted in figure  [ fig : duct_vel_ca_withback ] , together with the velocity on the centre streakline @xmath165 of the single - phase flow ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : streamline_background ] ) .",
    "all capsules move faster than the average flow velocity , a signature of the fhraeus effect .",
    "note that the equilibrium velocity @xmath176 , the velocity in a straight duct , decreases slightly with @xmath135 .",
    "this was also discussed by @xcite ( fig.8a in their paper ) : @xmath176 increases with @xmath135 as @xmath177 but decreases in the less confined case , @xmath178 ; our simulations with @xmath179 are between the two cases in @xcite and confirm the negative trend of @xmath176 at low confinement .",
    "the velocity of the capsule is related to the thickness of the capsule - wall lubrication film ; a thinner film induces higher viscous dissipation and thus reduces the capsule velocity .",
    "indeed , the thickness of the film when the capsule is slower ( @xmath173 ) , is about @xmath180 that of the fast capsule ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "the velocity of the capsule decreases when approaching the corner and increases when leaving it , reflecting the behaviour of the background flow ; the time histories reveal a minimum located at @xmath167 , when the particle centre is on the corner axis .",
    "this minimum velocity decreases with the capillary number @xmath135 ; indeed , a slightly thinner lubrication film is observed at the corner axis as @xmath135 changes from @xmath182 to @xmath183 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : duct_v_ca_profile ] ) . unlike the underlying flow ,",
    "the motion of the capsule clearly breaks the time - reversal symmetry about @xmath167 , revealing an overshoot during the recovery stage ; this symmetry breaking becomes more evident for higher @xmath135 .",
    "this loss of symmetry is related to the viscoelasticity induced by the fluid - capsule interaction .",
    "we report the shape of the capsule associated to the larger velocity overshoots ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath182 ) in figure  [ fig : duct_vel_ca_withback ] at the time the peak velocity is attained .",
    "a clear tail - like protrusion is observed for the two largest @xmath135s , due to the streamwise stretching induced by the background accelerating flow .",
    "such a shape is responsible for the observed velocity overshoot , as the streamwise membrane extension corresponds to a decrease of the cross - flow extension of the capsule ( its volume must be conserved ) .",
    "this causes a larger distance between capsule and wall and a reduced viscous dissipation .",
    "not surprisingly , as the capsule leaves the corner , its vertical dimension recovers to the equilibrium value and so does the velocity .",
    "the velocity does not converge exactly to its equilibrium value , a maximum relative difference of around @xmath186 is observed .",
    "it would require a prohibitively long computational domain and integration time to obtain a precise convergence as also observed by @xcite ; the physics of the final capsule relaxation is therefore beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "the capsule surface area , @xmath187 , is used as indicator of the global deformation .",
    "this is reported in figure  [ fig : duct_areatt_ca ] for the same cases in figure  [ fig : duct_vel_ca ] .",
    "as the capsule is far away from the corner , the area maintains the equilibrium value @xmath188 , an increasing function of @xmath135 .",
    "the area variation @xmath189 is almost zero for the cases with @xmath181 and @xmath183 , whereas it grows to values around @xmath190 when @xmath173 .",
    "as the capsule travels around the corner , the deformation reaches its peak value and its variation @xmath191 is around @xmath192 for the highest @xmath135 investigated .",
    "ideally , the dependence of the area on the capillary number can be used to deduce the membrane properties of capsules as shown by @xcite , who focus on the identification based on deformation .",
    "nevertheless , direct measurement of the total surface area is not easy , while it is more feasible to measure its two - dimensional projection . as a consequence",
    ", we display the projection of the capsule area on the @xmath2 mid - plane in figure  [ fig : duct_areaxy_ca ] .",
    "the projected area @xmath193 varies with time and cell deformability in a more complicated way .",
    "for the two smallest values of @xmath135 , @xmath193 reaches the minimum around @xmath167 before recovering to the equilibrium value past the corner .",
    "the cases characterized by @xmath174 and @xmath182 display a clear peak in deformation right after @xmath167 , with two sharp troughs one before and one after .",
    "this wavy variation is already visible as @xmath184 although weak .",
    "further examination of the behaviour in the range @xmath194 $ ] confirms that the time traces of the area deformation become more wavy as @xmath135 increases ; indeed more elastic material is prone to exhibit more oscillatory motions under the same excitation , the spatially developing flow here .",
    "the inset of figure .",
    "[ fig : duct_areaxy_ca ] shows the time @xmath195 corresponding to the minimum projected area @xmath193 .",
    "this can be regarded as the phase lag of the capsule and it increases almost linearly with @xmath135 .",
    "the tension developing on the membrane is of great importance since it influences the release of molecules  @xcite and atp  @xcite by rbcs and causes haemolysis , to cite two examples .",
    "we analyse the principal tension @xmath196 , to better understand the potential mechanical damage of capsules passing through a corner . for any definition of strain energy function @xmath81 ,",
    "@xmath197 are derived as  @xcite : @xmath198 we consider the major principal tension : @xmath199 and the isotropic principal tension @xmath200 ; their surface maximum @xmath201 and @xmath202 are defined as @xmath203 where @xmath204 will be omitted hereinafter for the sake of clarity .",
    "the temporal evolution of @xmath205 and @xmath206 are shown in figure  [ fig : duct_prsts_ca ] for capsules going through a straight corner .",
    "for most cases , both quantities increase monotonically with @xmath135 , reaching the peak values slightly after the corner before relaxing back to the equilibrium value . the difference between the two tensions is more pronounced at the corner , @xmath207 , and weak in the straight ducts .",
    "we also report in the figure the shape of some capsules when the maximum major principal tension is reached , with the minimum and maximum of @xmath208 indicated by circles and square respectively .",
    "the maximum of @xmath208 develops in the front for the capsules as @xmath209 , while it moves to the top part as @xmath173 .",
    "material points are prone to accumulate in the rear of the capsule and the principal tension is therefore relatively low . as @xmath135 increases , the rear part of the capsule changes from a convex to concave shape , something more evident for the case @xmath173 .",
    "we examine first the influence of confinement on the capsule motion by varying the width @xmath210 from @xmath211 to @xmath212 .",
    "the velocity of the capsule , divided by its equilibrium velocity , is shown in figure  [ fig : varywid_vel ] at @xmath213 .",
    "the time - symmetry around @xmath167 is almost preserved for the least confined case @xmath214 . as the confinement increases , the symmetry breaking discussed before and the corresponding velocity overshoot become more apparent .",
    "these are associated to a decrease of the minimum velocity at the corner .",
    "as @xmath210 varies from @xmath215 to @xmath211 , the velocity overshoot also clearly increases .",
    "the shape of the capsule at the time of maximum velocity is also displayed in the figure .",
    "the capsule with highest velocity is more elongated and has a larger distance from the wall ( lower lubrication friction ) , in analogy to the observations in section  [ sec : velocity ] for capsules of different elasticity .",
    "the surface maximum of the nondimensional major principal tension @xmath205 is depicted in figure  [ fig : varywid_prsts ] for the same cases : @xmath208 increases monotonically with the confinement . the maximum over time of @xmath216 is displayed versus @xmath217 for @xmath184 and @xmath218 in the inset of the same figure to show that the peak principal tension increases linearly with @xmath217 .",
    "this relationship may be useful to estimate the mechanical stress / damage on the cells in micro - fluidic devices already during the design stage .",
    "finally , we consider a curved corner with inner radius @xmath219 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ductwithbent_prsts_ca ] we compare the principal tensions on the membrane with those in the straight corner for capillary numbers @xmath172 and @xmath185 . except for the isotropic principal tension of the capsule @xmath172 , the principal tension decreases significantly in the curved corner .",
    "we investigate the motion of a three - dimensional deformable capsule , whose membrane obeys the neo - hookean constitutive relation , in a square duct flow with a corner .",
    "we present in this work a new implementation of the boundary integral method accelerated by the ggem , the general geometry ewald method , to resolve fluid - structure interactions at low reynolds number in complex geometries .",
    "the algorithm is coupled with a spectral method based on spherical harmonics for the membrane dynamics . in this section ,",
    "we first discuss the details of the numerical method , followed by a short summary of the main physical findings .    the ggem shares similarities with the classic immersed boundary methods ( ibm )  @xcite .",
    "both approaches require a lagrangian mesh for the suspended objects and an eulerian ( typically cartesian ) mesh for the fluid ; the dirac delta function , representing the localized forcing from the object , is approximated numerically . in the ibm",
    ", the localized force is spread from each lagrangian point onto a number of surrounding eulerian points to enforce the desired boundary conditions at the fluid / solid interface .",
    "the accuracy of ibm degenerates if close hydrodynamic interactions arise , which may requires ad hoc corrections to account for the correct lubrication forces @xcite . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : global_forcing ] ) , the dirac delta function is also smeared in the local problem of ggem , but its singular behaviour can be solved accurately by boundary integral techniques with singular integration . if a regularized - stokeslet technique is instead employed as in @xcite , the ggem closely resembles a ibm as proved by  @xcite .",
    "note also that traditional ibm requires a uniform eulerian grid to conserve the moments of the force and sophisticated treatments are needed to adapt ibm to a non - uniform and/or unstructured grid as done by @xcite and @xcite among others .",
    "one advantage of the ggem is that the smoothing of the local forcing is exactly compensated by the global forcing due to the linearity of stokes equations .",
    "the integral of the force field and its moments are therefore preserved .",
    "hence , stokes solvers based on uniform or non - uniform grids can be readily coupled to the ggem . in our case ,",
    "the eulerian grid points ( gll points ) are non - uniformly distributed as shown in figure  [ fig : mesh_fd_cl ] .",
    "ggem is originally designed to resolve the hydrodynamic interaction among multiple particles in stokes flows .",
    "suppose to have @xmath220 particles and each of them is discretized into @xmath13 lagrangian points , the total number of points is @xmath221 and the number of degrees of freedom @xmath222 . for traditional non - accelerated bim , the number of operations required to form the mobility matrix scales with @xmath223 .",
    "this poses the major difficulty in applying bim to a large number of particles .",
    "accelerating techniques for bim have thus been developed to overcome this restriction , and ggem is one of them .",
    "the decomposition of the dirac delta function into two parts reduces the number of operations from @xmath224 to @xmath225 or @xmath226  @xcite . the modified green s function for the local problem",
    "is designed such that the local solution decays exponentially over a distance of about @xmath35 .",
    "neglecting interactions that occur beyond the cut - off distance @xmath227 , the number of operations for the local solution decreases and scales linearly with @xmath228 .",
    "the scaling of the global problem depends on the mesh - based solver , as well as the geometry and boundary conditions of the computational domain .",
    "the solver used here , nek5000 , is computationally more expensive than fourier - based methods as those used in @xcite , but it allows for arbitrary geometries and is highly parallel .",
    "it is hard to provide a scaling for the global part of the problem in general geometries , however the advantage of a numerical approach like that pursued here relies on two points : i ) ggem provides a convenient way to reshape the @xmath224 long - ranged interactions and pack them into a problem solvable by a mesh - based solver ; ii ) a highly parallel solver is chosen to considerably reduce the computational time .",
    "note that a naive parallelization of traditional bim implementations is not possible for a large @xmath228 due to the prohibitively large amount of memory needed and poor scalability of the linear system with a dense matrix .",
    "it should be said that our implementation might be less efficient than traditional bim to study the dynamics of one ( as we do here ) or a few capsules .",
    "this is however our first step in the development of a computational framework for suspensions of deformable / rigid particles in general geometries .",
    "this numerical approach is used here to examine the motion of a capsule through a square duct with a corner , focusing on its trajectory , velocity , deformation , total and projected surface area , and principal tension .",
    "we aim to better understand the transient dynamics of capsules in a micro - fluidic device with realistic geometries .",
    "we study the deformation of the capsules when varying the capillary number , the ratio of viscous to elastic forces .",
    "the capsule trajectories closely follow the underlying flow and are therefore rather insensitive to how the capsules deform .",
    "due to the strong confinement , deviations from the underlying streamline requires a significantly viscous dissipation .",
    "conversely , the deformability of a capsule closely influences its shape , velocity and the mechanical stress developing on the membrane as documented in the results section .",
    "the corner flow can be potentially adopted to infer the material properties of deformable particles as shown by @xcite and @xcite using straight tube or channel flows .",
    "unlike these works , transient effects are present in the flow past a corner because of its spatial inhomogeneity . when the capsule is far away from the corner , the surface area , velocity and principal tension reach equilibrium values that are function of the capillary number @xmath135 .",
    "when flowing around the corner , the membrane area and tension reach their maxima while the velocity the minimum ; these extrema are shown here to clearly depend on @xmath135 . by utilizing a spatially developing flow , the shape and/or velocity of the capsules",
    "can be measured not only at the equilibrium state but also during the transient motions .",
    "more robust and accurate inverse methods may be developed using measurements of the extrema values .",
    "we further note a new time scale is introduced in the corner flow , hence the phase lag of the capsule can be identified as illustrated by the temporal evolution of the projected area ( see figure .",
    "[ fig : duct_areaxy_ca ] ) ; this quantity indicating the viscoelasticity of capsule is not accessible from the traditional steady flow experiments .",
    "the spatially developing flow indeed provides supplemental information characterising the material properties of natural and synthetic cellular structures .",
    "the capsule shape is also closely linked to its velocity . for low @xmath135 ,",
    "the velocity is similar to that of the underlying flow , with an almost perfect time - reversal symmetry ; as @xmath135 increases , i.e.  more pronounced deformations , this symmetry is broken and a velocity overshoot appears past the corner .",
    "the streamwise elongation of the capsule increases the capsule - wall distance , and the corresponding lower viscous dissipation can explain the higher capsule velocity .",
    "the surface maxima of the major and isotropic principal tension become significantly different only when the capsule is flowing around the corner . during this time",
    ", the maximum major principal tension appears in the front for capsules for configurations with low @xmath135 , and shifts towards the outer edge as @xmath135 increases .",
    "we have also examined the influence of confinement and of the geometry of corner .",
    "we identify a positive correlation between the asymmetry of the velocity profile and the level of confinement .",
    "the peak of the major principal tension increases linearly with the inverse of the duct width @xmath217 . finally , we show that a curved corner reduces the major principal tension and the deformation of the capsule .",
    "we believe the present work can improve our understanding of the capsule motion in complex geometries and support the the design of micro - fluidic devices with multiple corners and branches .",
