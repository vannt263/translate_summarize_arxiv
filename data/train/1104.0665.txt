    "the high densities and low temperatures of the intracluster medium ( hereafter icm ) in the cores of some galaxy clusters suggests that massive amounts ( 1001000 m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 ) of cool gas should be deposited onto the central galaxy .",
    "the fact that this gas reservoir is not observed has been used as prime evidence for feedback - regulated cooling ( see review by fabian 1994 ) . by invoking feedback , either by active galactic nuclei ( hereafter agn ) ( e.g. , guo et  al .",

    "can greatly reduce the efficiency of icm cooling , producing a better match with what is observed in high resolution x - ray grating spectra of cool cores ( 0100 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , peterson et  al .",
    "however , these modest cooling flows had remained unaccounted for at low temperatures until only recently .",
    "the presence of warm , ionized gas in the form of h@xmath0 emitting filaments has been observed in the cores of several cooling flow clusters to date ( e.g. , hu et  al .",

    "<S> we have assembled a sample of high spatial resolution far - uv ( hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys solar blind channel ) and h@xmath0 ( maryland - magellan tunable filter ) imaging for 15 cool core galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> these data provide a detailed view of the thin , extended filaments in the cores of these clusters . </S>",
    "<S> based on the ratio of the far - uv to h@xmath0 luminosity , the uv spectral energy distribution , and the far - uv and h@xmath0 morphology , we conclude that the warm , ionized gas in the cluster cores is photoionized by massive , young stars in all but a few ( abell  1991 , abell  2052 , abell  2580 ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the extended filaments , when considered separately , appear to be star - forming in the majority of cases , while the nuclei tend to have slightly lower far - uv luminosity for a given h@xmath0 luminosity , suggesting a harder ionization source or higher extinction . we observe a slight offset in the uv / h@xmath0 ratio from the expected value for continuous star formation which can be modeled by assuming intrinsic extinction by modest amounts of dust ( e(b - v )  @xmath1  0.2 ) , or a top - heavy imf in the extended filaments . </S>",
    "<S> the measured star formation rates vary from @xmath1  0.05  m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 in the nuclei of non - cooling systems , consistent with passive , red ellipticals , to @xmath1  5  m@xmath2  yr@xmath3 in systems with complex , extended , optical filaments . comparing the estimates of the star formation rate based on uv , h@xmath0 and infrared luminosities to the spectroscopically - determined x - ray cooling rate </S>",
    "<S> suggests a star formation efficiency of 14@xmath4% . this value represents the time - averaged fraction , by mass , of gas cooling out of the intracluster medium which turns into stars , and agrees well with the global fraction of baryons in stars required by simulations to reproduce the stellar mass function for galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides a new constraint on the efficiency of star formation in accreting systems . </S>"
