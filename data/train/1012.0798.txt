    "<S> assuming that in the hot dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , the energy density , entropy density , and pressure as well as the azimuthal and space - time rapidity components of the shear tensor are uniform in the direction transversal to the reaction plane , we derive a set of schematic equations from the isreal - stewart causal viscous hydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are then used to describe the evolution dynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions by taking the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of @xmath0 for the initial quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase and of ten times this value for the later hadron - gas ( hg ) phase . using the production rate evaluated with particle distributions that take into account the viscous effect , we study dilepton production in central heavy - ion collisions . compared with results from the ideal hydrodynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we find that although the dilepton invariant mass spectra from the two approaches are similar , the transverse momentum spectra are significantly enhanced at high transverse momenta by the viscous effect . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the transverse momentum dependence of dileptons produced from qgp for a fixed transverse mass which is essentially absent in the ideal hydrodynamics , and find that this so - called transverse mass scaling is violated in the viscous hydrodynamics , particularly at high transverse momenta . </S>"
