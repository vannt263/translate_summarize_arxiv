    "neutrino heating and cooling plays an important role in a variety of astrophysical objects . in core collapse supernovae ( sne )",
    "neutrinos produced deep within the core of the forming protoneutron star ( pns ) are thought to deposit some fraction of their energy in a semitransparent region above the surface of the pns , leading to a neutrino driven wind @xcite and a robust supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "although it is currently thought that neutrino - nucleon scattering provides the bulk of energy transfer in this region , a significant fraction of the energy and momentum exchange between the neutrinos and the matter occurs through neutrino - antineutrino annihilation to electron - positron pairs and through neutrino - electron scattering .",
    "more recently , neutrino - electron interactions have been proposed as an energy deposition mechanism for the central engines of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "a large fraction of the binding energy released during the formation of a compact object is emitted in the form of neutrinos and antineutrinos . both neutron star - neutron star mergers and",
    "the new `` collapsar '' models for the formation of grb fireballs rely on neutrino - antineutrino annihilation to electron - positron pairs as a mechanism for the transport of energy from the dense and hot regions to regions of low baryon loading where a fireball can form and expand @xcite . unfortunately , even for the extremely high neutrino densities expected in these systems ,",
    "the cross section of neutrino - antineutrino annihilation in the absence of a strong magnetic field is still quite low , which means that the overall efficiency of conversion of gravitational potential energy to fireball energy is also low .",
    "thus , it is very difficult to explain the most energetic of grbs using neutron star - neutron star merger models , and even the collapsar models have some difficulty in depositing sufficient energy to drive the fireball through the overlying mantle of the star @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical arguments for the existence of supercritical fields in nature have grown stronger recently with the discovery of magnetars @xcite . in these slowly rotating x - ray emitters , field strengths of up to @xmath1",
    "have been inferred .",
    "one may speculate that even stronger fields may be present when such objects are born .",
    "this discovery negates previous theoretical prejudice against the existence of such strong fields , and suggest further examination of the effect that strong magnetic fields may have on neutrino - electron processes .    in the absence of a strong magnetic field",
    ", there are only two allowed types of interaction between neutrinos and electrons  neutrino - electron scattering ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , and electron - positron pair creation and annihilation ( @xmath4 ) . in the presence of a quantizing magnetic field ,",
    "electrons occupy definite states of momentum perpendicular to the field ( landau levels ) and conservation of perpendicular momentum between interacting particles is no longer required , as some of the momentum may be absorbed by the field .",
    "this allows a number of exotic reactions to proceed , where electrons or positrons jump between different landau levels while interacting with an external neutrino current .",
    "these processes are very similar to interactions between photons and electrons in a strong field , such as single photon pair creation , which is also forbidden in the absence of a strong field .",
    "the additional neutrino processes allowed in the presence of a strong magnetic field are absorption of a neutrino - antineutrino pair by an electron or positron ( @xmath5 ) , and the absorption or emission of an electron positron pair by a neutrino or antineutrino ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "each of these may have an important effect on the neutrino energy exchange opacities in a strongly magnetized plasma .",
    "a number of authors have shown that the rate of neutrino - electron processes are increased due to the presence of a supercritical magnetic field ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "kuznetsov and mikheev @xcite considered neutrino - electron scattering and the emission of an electron positron pair by a neutrino propagating through a magnetic field in the limit that the electrons and positrons are in the lowest landau level . they concluded that with a very strong field , the neutrino could lose only a small fraction of its energy through this process .",
    "while we do not analyse this process in detail numerically , our results for the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation processes suggest that the restriction that the electron and positron be in the lowest landau level is too strong .",
    "a more general calculation may be performed using the results presented in this paper .",
    "benesh and horowitz @xcite calculated the rate of neutrino - antineutrino annihilation to electron - positron pairs in a strong magnetic field .",
    "they examined two restrictive cases - nearly parallel collisions and head - on collisions - and found no significant enhancement of the cross section for these types of interactions .",
    "our more general calculation shows that there are regions of phase space with a significant increase in the annihilation cross - section , though for moderate field strengths , these regions are small .",
    "more importantly , we show that the new channels for annihilation which appears in a strong magnetic field - gyromagnetic absorption on electrons and positrons in the plasma - are more important over an astrophysically interesting range of phase space .",
    "bezchastnov and haensel @xcite calculated the rate of neutrino - electron scattering in a strong magnetic field by evaluating the matrix element for the feynman diagrams shown in figure 1 , using the exact wave - functions of the electrons in the strong field as external states for the calculation .",
    "considering energy ranges and magnetic field strengths appropriate for sne calculations , they showed that while the overall cross - section for this scattering rate was not a strong function of magnetic field strength up to @xmath9 g , the strong field introduced significant anisotropies in the rate , and could lead to interesting parity violating effects .    here",
    "we adopt a new approach to calculating the rates of neutrino - electron processes in a strong magnetic field . rather than adopting the direct approach of calculating the cross - sections from the diagrams shown in figure 1 , such as adopted in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we use a technique of finite temperature field theory ( ftft ) which relates the interaction rates to the imaginary part of the diagram shown in figure 2 ( as the energy of our interactions are low compared to the @xmath10-boson mass , we use the fermi theory to describe our interactions ) .",
    "this technique allows all the neutrino - electron interaction rates to be calculated on the same footing , and includes the effects of pauli blocking .",
    "we follow the approach of gale and kapusta @xcite which was developed in the context of calculating the rate of dilepton production from hadron interactions in heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is based on the fact that the rate of dilepton production is related to the imaginary part of the polarization tensor .",
    "in general , production as well as decay rates of particles in matter can be extracted from the imaginary part of self energies computed by using ftft @xcite . in our case , the interacting particles are neutrinos , not hadrons , and our interactions are electroweak interactions and not due to nuclear forces .",
    "this approach leads to two important simplifications , in that one obtains the total net rate of a given process , taking into account both forward and back reactions . also , numerical evaluation of the rates is greatly simplified , as one can calculate all of the rates virtually simultaneously .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the first section ,",
    "the expression relating the rate of a given neutrino - electron process to the imaginary part of the polarization tensor , based on the work of weldon @xcite and gale and kapusta @xcite , is presented .",
    "this expression is then used to calculate the rate at which neutrinos and antineutrinos annihilate to electron - positron pairs in an unmagnetized vacuum , demonstrating that one obtains the same results as the direct calculation .    in the following section , a strong magnetic field",
    "is introduced , and the polarization tensor in a strongly magnetized plasma is presented .",
    "the imaginary part of the polarization tensor is calculated , and expressions for the rates of each of the neutrino - electron processes are given .",
    "a detailed numerical evaluation of the annihilation rate is then performed , and the rate is shown to reproduce the unmagnetized rate in the limit of a weak magnetic field .    finally , the behaviour of the annihilation rate with increasing magnetic field strength is examined , and the implications for systems in which significant neutrino heating occurs , such as core collapse sne and grbs are discussed .",
    "ultimately , we wish to calculate the rate at which neutrinos and antineutrinos interact with electrons and positrons in a strong magnetic field in matter through the processes shown in figure 1 . rather than calculate these rates directly through the use of the exact electron wave functions in the magnetic field , such as performed by bezchastnov and haensel @xcite in their evaluation of the neutrino - electron scattering rate , we adopt an alternative approach suggested by the use of finite temperature field theory ( ftft ) .",
    "this theory has been pioneered by weldon @xcite and also applied by gale and kapusta @xcite to calculate the rate at which electron - positron pairs are emitted from the fireball in heavy ion collisions .    according to weldon @xcite the decay and production rate of a boson with energy @xmath11 at temperature @xmath12",
    "can be related to the imaginary part of the boson self energy @xmath13 by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the difference of the forward rate of the boson decay @xmath16 and the rate of the inverse process @xmath17 .",
    "the decay and production rates are related by the principle of detailed balance @xmath18 from which we get @xmath19    instead of considering the decay of a boson we will investigate first the case of neutrino - antineutrino annihilation to an electron - positron pair , @xmath20 , in an electron - positron plasma at temperature @xmath21 and chemical potential @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding annihilation rate is given by equation ( [ gamma2 ] ) , where the boson is replaced by the neutrino - antineutrino pair .",
    "to lowest order the self energy is now given by the diagram of figure 2 which contains an electron loop .",
    "the four momenta of the neutrino and antineutrino are denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 and of the electron and positron by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "here we use the notation @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the electron mass .",
    "then in equation ( [ gamma2 ] ) @xmath32 holds and the self energy is given by a lorentz tensor @xmath33 .",
    "next we want to relate the annihilation rate to the differential rate @xmath34 describing the absorption of a neutrino - antineutrino pair with momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the electron - positron plasma .",
    "usually , this rate would be calculated from the matrix element @xmath37 of figure 1 according to @xmath38 \\int \\frac{d^3p_2}{2e_2(2\\pi ) ^3}[1-n_{e^-}(e_2 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & ( 2\\pi)^4\\delta^4(q_1+q_2-p_1-p_2 ) \\sum_{i } \\langle |{\\cal m}|^2 \\rangle , \\label{matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where there is a sum over initial states and the fermi distribution function for the electron is given by @xmath39 and the one of the positron by replacing @xmath22 by @xmath40 in equation ( [ fermi ] ) .",
    "the distribution functions in equation ( [ matrix ] ) describe pauli blocking of the produced electron and positron in the plasma .",
    "following gale and kapusta @xcite the differential rate is obtained from the annihilation rate @xmath16 by taking into account the neutrino current @xmath41 here the leptonic tensor for the neutrinos is given by @xmath42 where we have summed over the neutrino spins .",
    "this formula differs from the one for the dilepton production rate given in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite by the absence of a photon propagator and a different structure of the leptonic tensor for massless neutrinos instead of electrons leading to the appearance of the antisymmetric tensor @xmath43 in equation ( [ leptens ] ) .",
    "furthermore the two expressions differ by a factor @xmath44 according to ( [ detbal ] ) because we are considering a decay instead of a production rate .",
    "the total rate for the production of electron - positron pairs from neutrino - antineutrino annihilation follows by integrating the differential forward rate , equation ( [ diffrate ] ) , over the neutrino distribution functions @xmath45 @xmath46\\ >    \\frac{dr_{\\nu \\bar \\nu}}{d^3q_1d^3q_2}. \\label{totrate}\\ ] ] here we have included the back reaction @xmath47 , which is described by the second term in the square brackets .",
    "it should be noted that our derivation of the rates at no time assumed that the neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium with the electron - positron plasma .",
    "for example , neutrinos that escape from the core of a supernova explosion may have a roughly thermal distribution with a temperature of @xmath48 mev . after leaving the core these neutrinos will interact with the surrounding electron - positron plasma which has a typical temperature of about @xmath49 mev . in this case",
    "the neutrino distribution functions in equation ( [ totrate ] ) are given by the equilibrium fermi distributions , equation ( [ fermi ] ) , where the temperature and the chemical potential are replaced by the corresponding values for the neutrinos escaping from the core , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "one may also determine the rate at which a neutrino scatters in a thermal plasma in a similar manner .",
    "the differential rate at which a neutrino ( or antineutrino ) scatters from an initial state @xmath23 to a final state @xmath24 , is given simply by replacing @xmath52 by @xmath53 in @xmath54 and @xmath32 by @xmath55 in equation ( [ diffrate ] ) .",
    "the total rate of scattering,@xmath56 , is then given by @xmath57\\ >",
    "\\frac{dr_{\\nu e^\\pm}}{d^3q_1d^3q_2 } \\label{scattotrate}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "note that both the electron and positron scattering rates are included within the imaginary part of the polarisation tensor in equation ( [ scatdiffrate ] ) .",
    "the strength of this method lies in the fact that the correct calculation of the imaginary part of the polarisation tensor leads the differential annihilation and scattering rates for all of the separate channels that are allowed within the plasma .",
    "thus , if one includes the effect of the magnetic field in the polarisation tensor properly , all of the exotic processes which occur in a magnetic field are included in the rate calculations by default .      to demonstrate",
    "that the two approaches , based either on the matrix element as in equation ( [ matrix ] ) or on the ftft as in equation ( [ diffrate ] ) are equivalent , we use equation ( [ diffrate ] ) to calculate the rate of neutrino - antineutrino annihilation to electron positron pairs in an unmagnetized vacuum at zero temperature , and show that it reproduces the results of the calculation of the process using the matrix element method .    in the one - loop approximation the polarisation tensor in equation ( [ diffrate ] ) is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fermi constant , @xmath62 is an electron propagator , and @xmath63 with @xmath64 the weinberg angle , and the plus sign corresponding to electron neutrinos , and the minus sign to muon and tau neutrinos .",
    "this tensor has been formulated in the limit that the neutrino energies are small compared to the @xmath10 mass , which will always be justified in practice .",
    "this allows the use of effective fermi 4-vertices in the processes shown in figure 1 and 2 .",

    "this corresponds to neglecting the effects of pauli blocking on the final state particles in equation ( [ matrix ] ) . inserting only the vacuum part of the electron propagators ,",

    "the branch cut is related to poles that appear above the pair creation threshold , @xmath72 , and it lies along the positive @xmath73 axis from @xmath74 to infinity .",

    "equation  ( [ eq:13 ] ) is identical to the rate , equation ( 4 ) , directly calculated for the process shown in figure 1 by electroweak theory , using @xmath82 .",
    "thus we have shown that the procedure outlined above is identical to the standard method of calculating rates .    for later reference , the rate at which the annihilation process proceeds in the absence of a magnetic field at zero temperature and in the limit of a vanishing electron mass , @xmath83 , is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the angle between the neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "we may now make a significant generalization of our theory , which justifies its introduction .",

    ", we now make a simple calculation of the rate of electron - positron pair production through neutrino - antineutrino pair annihilation in such a strong field that only electrons and positrons in the lowest landau orbital may be produced .",
    "this is not a physically interesting calculation , as the approximations made to allow an analytic calculation are quite extreme .      to illustrate the use of equation  ( [ eq:51 ] ) we calculate the rate at which electrons and positrons are created in the lowest landau orbital by neutrino - antineutrino annihilation for head - on collisions .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field lies in the @xmath203-direction , and let the neutrino 4-momenta be given by @xmath204 which lies in the @xmath205-@xmath203 plane , and @xmath206 . as the electron and positron",
    "are created in the lowest landau orbital , we have that @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and thus , @xmath209 .",

    "may be performed explicitly , leading to the rate of production of electron positron pairs in the lowest landau orbital from a neutrino - antineutrino pair , @xmath214 , \\label{eq:30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 has been used .",
    "equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) is to be evaluated at both of the solutions to @xmath218 .",
    "these are given by @xmath219 with @xmath220 also , @xmath221    we further restrict our attention to head - on collisions between a neutrino and antineutrino with the same energy , @xmath222 .",
    "leaving the angle between the neutrino and the magnetic field as @xmath223 , the antineutrino angles must be @xmath224 , and @xmath225 . under these conditions , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 , as we are in the centre of momentum frame .",
    "thus , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 .",
    "evaluating equation  ( [ eq:30 ] ) leads to @xmath230 where there is a factor of 2 due to the two roots of the resonant denominator . note the dependence on the angle with respect to the magnetic field",
    "this shows the intrinsic anisotropy of this process , in that neutrinos approaching head - on along the field line can not interact to produce pairs .",
    "in general , the calculation of the rates proceeds numerically .",
    "our simple calculation motivates the numerical approach .",
    "one specifies the incident neutrino energies and angles , and explicitly calculates the leptonic tensor , equation ( [ leptens ] ) .",
    "then , for each allowed @xmath92 and @xmath150 for the process in question , one calculates the location of the roots , and the vertex functions , equations  ( [ eq:21 ] ) to ( [ eq:24 ] ) , evaluated at these roots . from the vertex functions , one constructs the @xmath231 matrices and contracts them with the leptonic tensor .",
    "the results of the sum are then premultiplied with the phase space factors and other prefactors to give the differential rate of the process .",
    "while this is a reasonably complicated procedure , it has a certain natural advantage , as it exploits the similarities between the calculations of the different processes .",
    "the alternate method of bezchastnov and haensel @xcite is not essentially simpler .",
    "the procedure outlined here can be performed in such a way that the rates for all seven processes can be calculated simultaneously , with the common elements of the calculation shared for computational efficiency .",
    "thus far , it has proved impossible to show analytically that the expressions given above reduce to the unmagnetized rate in the limit of a weak magnetic field .",
    "however , the numerical calculation of the rates does reproduce the expected behaviour in the weak field limit . in figure 3 , we show the rate of electron - positron pair production through neutrino annihilation as a function of magnetic field strength , normalized to the unmagnetized rate .",
    "this plot shows that the unmagnetized limit is obtained in the limit of small magnetic field strength , as the graph tends to unity for a small magnetic field .",
    "we turn now to a more general survey of the properties of the annihilation rate as a function of magnetic field strength , neutrino energy , plasma temperature , and the various angles in the system . throughout",
    "we assume that the chemical potential of the plasma is zero . in general , the rates are very complicated functions of these variables . to determine the effect of a strong magnetic field on an astrophysical system",
    ", these rates must be averaged over thermal distributions of neutrinos and over a realistic angular distribution .",
    "this exercise is beyond the scope of this work .    in figure 4",
    "we show the rate of neutrino - antineutrino annihilation , scaled to the unmagnetized rate , of a 4 mev neutrino and a 5 mev antineutrino in a pair plasma of temperature @xmath232 mev as a function of magnetic field strength .",
    "this plot shows the fine structure that comes about due to the quantized perpendicular momentum states .",
    "the underlying rate of electron - positron pair production is a weak function of the field strength until around @xmath9 g. this is the field strength at which @xmath233 in scaled coordinates , and thus , the magnetic field begins to dominate above this level .",
    "it is also here that the rate of gyromagnetic absorption of neutrino - antineutrino pairs becomes significant - this is because the amount of energy required to lift an electron or positron from its lowest landau level to another ( low ) landau level is more closely matched to the available neutrino energy .",
    "this allows the phase space for this reaction to grow and for the process to proceed more vigorously .",
    "consequently , the effect of the magnetic field is stronger for low energy neutrinos .    in figure 5",
    "we show the annihilation rate for the same conditions as figure 4 , except that the magnetic field is fixed at @xmath234 g and the energy of the annihilating neutrino is allowed to vary .",
    "this plot shows the standard increase in cross section as a function of energy for the pair creation rate , but also shows a number of other interesting features .",
    "for instance , for low energy neutrinos , the pair creation rate is suppressed - this is because there is only enough energy to create pairs in the lowest landau level , and these states are filled by the thermal plasma . on the other hand",
    ", there is a significant rate of gyromagnetic absorption on the plasma particles in the lowest landau orbital , even for annihilation with the lowest energy neutrinos .",
    "of course , these rates must be averaged over thermal distributions of neutrinos and antineutrinos , so it is very unclear as to which of the processes will dominate for which regions of parameter space .",
    "figures 6 to 8 show the annihilation rates as a function of the angles of the system .",
    "they show that the annihilation rates are anisotropic , and can have a very sensitive dependence on angle . at higher neutrino energies or at lower field strengths there can be many more resonances , leading to highly anisotropic heating and momentum deposition .",
    "we have presented here a new calculation of the rates of neutrino - electron interactions in a strongly magnetized thermal electron - positron plasma using ftft . starting from the imaginary part of the polarization tensor all neutrino - electron processes , allowed in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "can be treated simultaneously .",
    "this calculation is accurate to first order in the fermi theory , treats the effect of the magnetic field on the wave functions of the electrons exactly , and includes the effects of pauli blocking .",
    "these calculations show that the rate of the standard unmagnetized processes may be modified greatly by the presence of a strong magnetic field , and that processes which only occur in a strong magnetic field are the dominant energy deposition processes for a range of field strengths and neutrino and antineutrino parameters .    to make stronger conclusions about the physical implications of these processes in strong magnetic fields it is necessary to average the rates calculated here over thermal distributions of neutrinos appropriate to the astrophysical scenarios being considered .",
    "however , it is clear that there must be a reconsideration of the role strong magnetic fields and neutrinos may play in extremely energetic astrophysical events such as core collapse supernovae and gamma ray bursts .",
