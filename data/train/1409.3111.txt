    "understanding the time evolution of an open quantum system ( for e.g. , a phenomenon such as quantum transport ) is an important issue in quantum physics .",
    "one of the most common methods to study the problem is the quantum - master - equation approach @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a classical master equation , a quantum master equation has a coherent part ( off - diagonal elements of the density matrix ) , which makes the problem difficult .",
    "for example , the non - commutativity due to off - diagonal elements prevents analytical calculation .",
    "the presence of the coherent part also leads to a difficulty in numerical calculation because in many - body quantum systems , the number of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix is considerably larger than the number of the diagonal elements .",
    "these difficulties are addressed by reducing a quantum master equation to the corresponding classical one , at least in the two following cases .",
    "one is the situation in which the system we consider is under the influence of environmental decoherence @xcite .",
    "the other is the decoupling between the population part and the coherent part achieved by the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting classical master equations are easy to calculate and they are also intuitively understandable .",
    "these classical reductions are uniformly described by the projection - operator technique .",
    "although these methods have succeeded in many areas of quantum physics , the classical reduction of the master equation for quantum energy transport fails as we will describe afterward .    in the current paper , we present a new method of classical reduction that involves not only the classical reduction of the quantum master equation but also the transformation of the physical observables .",
    "the concept underlying our method is the similarity transformation of liouvillians , and the formulation explicitly indicates the necessity of the transformation of the observables .",
    "this is a crucial difference between the conventional approaches ( for e.g. the projection - operator technique ) and our method , which solves the difficulty of the conventional approaches .",
    "we provide the formula for the transformation of the observables in the general form .",
    "the rwa is one of the most popular methods to obtain a quantum master equation that is of the lindblad form , which is a desirable property because it ensures the trace preserving property and complete positivity of the density matrix @xcite .",
    "the rwa is generally applicable as long as the energy levels are not degenerate and the system is weakly coupled with its environment . however , in the study of quantum energy transport , the use of the rwa leads to a puzzling problem @xcite .",
    "the density matrix in the steady state for the master equation with the rwa is diagonal in the energy representation , while the internal energy current operator is off - diagonal .",
    "consequently , there is no resulting energy flow for the rwa master equation .",
    "only the calculation of the bath - to - system energy flux is successfully performed , for example , with the generalized quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "this is highly unphysical , and it has been frequently considered that the rwa is inappropriate for the study of energy transport .",
    "our method that utilizes a similarity transformation clearly addresses the problem : the observables should also be transformed in the rwa .",
    ".comparison table between the redfield equation , the assumed lindblad equation , and the rwa - equation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the solution of the problem in the rwa has much significance in the study of quantum energy transport .",
    "conventionally , two approaches for the problem of quantum energy transport have been proposed .",
    "one is to use the redfield equation which is derived from the total hamiltonian including the reservoir and the interaction hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the redfield equation is unfortunately not of the lindblad form and does not ensure the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to compute the redfield equation . if we take the rwa in the redfield equation , we obtain the classical equation that is of the lindblad form . however , the rwa - equation has the problem as mentioned above and has not been much used .",
    "the other approach is to start with the lindblad equation without derivation from the total hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the dissipator in this case consists of local operators of the edges of the system .",
    "although the assumed lindblad equation is easy to calculate compared to the redfield equation , it lacks its physical picture and the stationary solution of the master equation is not the canonical equilibrium distribution ( gibbs state ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , the assumed lindblad equation can be derived from the quantum repeated interaction model ( qrim ) , which is a model to represent the laser - beam - like interaction and does not conserve the total energy @xcite .",
    "the qrim is thus inappropriate as a model to study the energy transport .",
    "the two conventional approaches have these defects respectively . in contrast",
    ", the rwa has a clear physical picture , and at the same time , it ensures the positivity of the density matrix ( table [ compari ] ) .    as another advantage of the idea of the similarity transformation of liouvillans",
    ", we show that the quantum - to - classical reduction _ rigorously _ holds for the calculation of a quantity such as transport efficiency .",
    "the classical picture is intuitive , and it aids in understanding environment - assisted quantum transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ secmethod ] , we present a general method of reducing a quantum markovian master equation to the corresponding classical one by means of utilizing a similarity transformation . in section [ secexample ] , we apply the method to a system under the influence of decoherence , and we confirm the validity of our method . in section [ secrwa ] , we explain why the expectation value of the energy current vanishes in the steady state of the rwa master equation , and we show that the transformation of observables by our method recovers the consistency .",
    "another technique of quantum - to - classical reduction is presented in section [ secexact ] .",
    "the summary of the study is provided in section [ secsum ] . throughout the paper",
    ", we set the planck constant to unity .",
    "in this section , we present a method to extract the effective classical liouvillian for a quantum system .",
    "our strategy is to split the eigenvalue problem of the liouvillian into the population part and the coherent part in a certain basis .",
    "we show that the splitting procedure can be carried out by a similarity transformation .",
    "first , we define the inner product of operators @xmath0 as ( a , b ) = [ a^b ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote arbitrary operators . with the definition ,",
    "we represent the quantum markovian master equation in the block matrix form : [ eq2 ] = l=    l _ & l _ + l _ & l _    _ + _    . here ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the diagonal and off - diagonal components , respectively , in a certain basis of the density matrix @xmath5 . since in the present paper , we treat superoperators as matrices and operators as vectors , in order to avoid confusion , we call the subspace spanned by the diagonal components of operators as  p - space \" and the remnant space  c - space . \"",
    "the dynamics is called classical if it is closed in p - space .",
    "we assume that the minimum value of the diagonal components of the superoperator @xmath6 ( say @xmath7 ) is much larger than the maximum of the other components of @xmath8 ( say @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is the condition of application for the method in this study .",
    "for example , if the energy levels of the system are not degenerate and the unitary part of the liouvillian is large compared to other parts , the diagonal components of @xmath6 in the energy representation have large values , which is also the condition of application for the rwa . in this case",
    ", the minimum of the energy level spacings corresponds to @xmath7 . in the following , without loss of generality , we set @xmath10 and @xmath11 for simplicity .    the solution of the quantum master equation is related to the eigenvalue problem [ ep ]    l _ & l _ + l _ & l _    _ ^e + _ ^e    = e    _ ^e + _ ^e    , where @xmath12 denotes the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "the above equation can be solved formally , and we obtain the equation for @xmath14 as [ rd ] ( l _ + l _ _ ) _ ^e = e _ ^e .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath8 are divided into two groups .",
    "one consists of the eigenvalues of @xmath15 and the other those of @xmath16 .",
    "the latter is related to coherence decaying or fast rotating wave dynamics and the time scale is fast .",
    "therefore , the dynamics can be regarded as a classical one when we focus only on phenomena occurring at sufficiently large time scales . for an eigenvalue @xmath17 that has an @xmath18 value ,",
    "the following equation approximately holds : [ cd ] ( l _ -l _ _ ) _ ^ = _",
    "^+o(^-2 ) .",
    "the above effective liouvillian is nothing but that derived by the projection - operator technique .",
    "the above procedure can be understood in terms of a similarity transformation of @xmath8 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem expressed by eq .",
    "is transformed by an arbitrary non - singular matrix ( superoperator ) @xmath19 without any changes in the eigenvalue :    l _ & l _ + l _ & l _    s^-1s    _ ^e + _ ^e    = e s    _ ^e + _ ^e    .",
    "let us define the transformed liouvillian @xmath20 and the new density matrix @xmath21 .",
    "we note that the transformation may violate the property of positive mapping , and in fact , there exists a transformation from a positive mapping liouvillian to a non - positive mapping liouvillian .",
    "if we choose @xmath19 as [ s1 ] s =    i & 0 + -(e - l_)^-1l _ & i    , then , the density matrix is transformed as [ 7 ] ^ = s^ =    _ ^e + 0    .",

    "^e = _ _ ^e holds from eq . .",
    "the transformed liouvillian @xmath22 is expressed as [ prime ] l=    j & l _ + l _",

    "& i    , which does not depend on eigenvalues .",
    "all the eigenvectors of @xmath25 are transformed as eq . .",
    "next , let us consider the time evolution of the density matrix .",
    "a density matrix is expanded by the eigenvectors of the liouvillian , and its time evolution can be expressed as [ expand ] ( t ) = ^lt ( 0 ) = ^lt ( _ c _ ^ + _ c_^ ^ ) , where the @xmath26 values denote the eigenvectors of the liouvillian , which correspond to the eigenvalues of @xmath27 , and the @xmath28 values denote the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of @xmath29 . @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 denote the coefficients of the expansion .",
    "we can ignore the summation over @xmath32 in eq . because the time evolution of @xmath28 is fast - decaying in the case wherein the real parts of the eigenvalues are large or the time evolution is fast - rotating if the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are large .",

    ", we obtain the following equation : ( t ) = ^lt s ( 0 )    ^l_t _ ( 0 ) + 0    , where we define the superoperator @xmath33 as [ maineq ] l _ = l _ -l _ l_^-1l_. this expression is equivalent to eq . .",

    "the statistical average of an arbitrary physical observable @xmath1 can be written as : [ a ( t ) ] = [ a s^-1 s ( t ) ] = [ a s^-1 ^l_t _ ( 0 ) ] .",
    "thus , when we reduce the quantum master equation to the classical one , the observable @xmath1 also should be transformed to @xmath34 as : = a s^-1 = \\{s^-1}^ a , where we introduce the adjoint superoperator for convenience , which is defined for an arbitrary superoperator @xmath35 as @xcite [ ak ] = [ ( k^a ) ] . from eq .",

    "<S> a general method of quantum - to - classical reduction of quantum dynamics is described . </S>",
    "<S> the key aspect of our method is the similarity transformation of the liouvillian , which provides a new perspective . in conventional studies of quantum energy transport , </S>",
    "<S> the rotating wave approximation has been frequently regarded as an inappropriate approach because it causes the energy flow through the system to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> our formulation elucidates as to why this unphysical result occurs and provides a solution for the problem . </S>",
    "<S> that is , not only the density matrix but also the physical quantity is to be transformed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that quantum dynamics can be  exactly \" replaced with classical equations for the calculation of the transport efficiency . </S>"
