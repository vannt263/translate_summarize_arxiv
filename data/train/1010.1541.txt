    "deuteron represents an ideal micro - lab for studies of the structure of @xmath2 interaction ranging from the intermediate to very small distances ( see e.g. @xcite .    the simplest reaction which could be used to investigate short - range @xmath2 interactions in nuclear targets is the exclusive electrodisintegration of the deuteron in which large magnitudes of the relative momentum of the @xmath3 system in the ground state are probed .",
    "expectations that this can be achieved only at high - momentum transfer reactions@xcite was confirmed in a series of high energy experiments@xcite involving various nuclei .",
    "three experiments@xcite have been performed recently using deuteron target at relatively high  ( up to 6  gev ) energy electron beam of the jefferson lab and more comprehensive experimental program will follow after the 12  gev upgrade of the lab .",
    "this makes the development of theoretical approaches for the description of high @xmath0 electro - nuclear processes involving deuteron a pressing issue . since mid 90 s",
    "there were an intensive efforts in developing such theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "in this work@xcite we study one particular process that is high @xmath0 disintegration of the deuteron with probing large magnitudes of recoil nucleon momenta .",
    "the model is based on virtual nucleon approximation in which the struck nucleon is treated as an off - shell particle .",
    "the main theoretical framework is based on the generalized eikonal approximation  ( gea)@xcite which allows us to represent the reaction through the set of covariant diagrams ( fig.1 ) for which effective feynman diagram rules can be defined .",
    "because of the covariance of the diagrams the virtualities involved in the scattering amplitudes are defined unambiguously .",
    "this allows us to develop a self consistent approach for accounting for the binding effects in the high @xmath0 electromagnetic interaction off the bound nucleon .",
    "the second important feature of gea is that final - state interaction of produced two nucleons is calculated without requiring stationary approximation for the recoil nucleons - this is important feature for calculating processes in which the recoil nucleon is produced with large momenta .",
    "first , one considers only the @xmath3 component of the deuteron , neglecting inelastic initial state transitions .",
    "since the deuteron is in a isosinglet state this will correspond to restricting the kinetic energy of recoil nucleon to @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are masses of the nucleon and low - lying non - strange baryonic resonances .    then",
    ", one neglects by the negative energy projection of the virtual nucleon propagator .",
    "this can be justified if , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the deuteron and @xmath10 is the relative momentum of the bound @xmath3 system .",
    "the third assumption which is made in the calculation is that at large @xmath0  ( @xmath11  gev@xmath12 ) the interaction of virtual photon with exchanged mesons are a small correction and can be neglected ( see e.g. discussions in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the assumptions discussed above allow us to restrict the consideration by the set of feynman diagrams presented in fig.([fig1 ] ) , which can be calculated based on the effective feynman diagram rules derived in gea@xcite",
    ". this work does not include calculation of the diagram of fig.1d which is currently in progress .",
    "* plane wave impulse approximation amplitude : * + starting with the covariant form of the amplitude of fig1.a , we calculate explicitly the off shell part of the electromagnetic amplitude through the one - shell positive energy reduction of the propagator of the spectator nucleon@xcite .",
    "this procedure results to the pwia amplitude@xcite : @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the covariant on - shell electromagnetic current of the nucleon and @xmath16 in which @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "note that the total current in eq.([j_n ] ) is conserved since it is derived from the gauge invariant amplitude and no additional conditions are needed to restore the current conservation .",
    "* forward elastic and charge interchange final state interaction amplitudes : * + applying the effective feynman diagram rules to the diagrams of fig.([fig1])b , c and projecting ( similar to pwia ) the propagator of the spectator nucleon to its positive energy solution for the forward rescattering amplitude we obtain : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in high energy limit",
    "in which the helicity conservation of small angle nn scattering is rather well established the on - shell amplitude is predominantly imaginary and can be parameterized in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are found from fitting of experimental data on elastic @xmath29 scattering .",
    "for the half - off - shell part of the @xmath30 amplitude we use the following parameterization : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .    for the charge - exchange final state interaction amplitude",
    "( fig.1c ) the derivation is similar and it is expressed through the charge - exchange @xmath33 scattering amplitude .",
    "+    mev / c and @xmath34  mev / c respectively .",
    "the labels 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 correspond to the following values of @xmath35  gev@xmath12 .",
    "the data sets and calculations for `` 4 '' and `` 5 '' in ( b ) are multiplied by 0.5 and 0.25 respectively , title=\"fig : \" ]  mev / c and @xmath34  mev / c respectively .",
    "the labels 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 correspond to the following values of @xmath35  gev@xmath12 .",
    "the data sets and calculations for `` 4 '' and `` 5 '' in ( b ) are multiplied by 0.5 and 0.25 respectively , title=\"fig : \" ]    * deuteron wave function : * + to fix the normalization of the deuteron wave function we use the fact that the deuteron elastic charge form - factor @xmath36 at @xmath37 . using above condition in the elastic deuteron scattering amplitude one can relate the deuteron wave function in virtual nucleon approximation to the nonrelativistic deuteron wave function as follows@xcite @xmath38 this relation provides a smooth transition to the nonrelativistic wave function @xmath39 in the small momentum limit .",
    "in the last few years three experiments@xcite produced the first data at relatively large @xmath0 kinematics .",
    "the experiment of ref.@xcite ) covered the highest to date @xmath0 range from @xmath40  gev@xmath12 .",
    "comparison with these experimental data are given in fig.[fig2 ] which allow us to make the following conclusions :    - the angular distribution clearly exhibits an eikonal feature , with the minimum ( fig.[fig2](a ) ) or maximum ( fig.[fig2](b ) ) at transverse kinematics due to the final state interaction .",
    "the most important result is that the maximum of fsi is at recoil angles of @xmath41 in agreement with the gea prediction of ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the conventional glauber theory predicted @xmath42 for the fsi maximum .",
    "- the disagreement of the calculation with the data at @xmath43 appears to be due to the isobar contribution at the intermediate state of the reaction .",
    "this region corresponds to @xmath44 and it is kinematically closer to the threshold of @xmath45-isobar electroproduction . the comparisons also indicate that the relative strength of the @xmath45-isobar contribution diminishes with an increase of @xmath0 and at neutron production angles @xmath46 .",
    "- the forward direction of the recoil nucleon momentum , being far from the @xmath45-isobar threshold , exhibits a relatively small contribution due to fsi .",
    "this indicates that the forward recoil angle region is best suited for studies of pwia properties of the reaction such as the off - shell electromagnetic current and deuteron wave function .",
    "these comparisons clearly show that the forward angles of spectator nucleon production is best suited for isolating pwia scattering off the virtual nucleon .",
    "therefore this kinematic region provides the most optimal condition for probe and studying the @xmath2 interaction at short internucleon separations .",
