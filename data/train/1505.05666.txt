    ", a number of graphene layers can be so stacked that any adjacent two are shifted from each other in either direction along the armchair orientation . among others ,",
    "abc - stacking configuration is especially noticeable in that all the layers are shifted in a unique direction .",
    "a non - trivial topological phase is accommodated therein,@xcite giving rise to surface states that are localized at the outermost layers and coupled to the rest , so - called bulk states.@xcite this is distinct from ab - stacking configuration,@xcite whose trivial topology does not render any surface states.@xcite in general , these surface states are characterized by flat band dispersion about the zero energy . it is well known that the flat surface subbands in abc - stacked @xmath0-layer graphene can be obtained from a chiral effective hamiltonian with chirality @xmath1.@xcite corresponding quantum hall effects ( qhes ) have been predicted@xcite and observed at least for @xmath2.@xcite apart from the surface subbands , the bulk subbands are gapped and seem to be intricate .",
    "they evolve to be even more complex with increasing @xmath0,@xcite while the surface subbands are more and more flat.@xcite so far , the bulk subbands remain unsolved , probably because no attractive properties are expected from them . there is , however , something remarkable in their evolution to the three - dimensional ( @xmath3d ) realm as is highlighted in recent research .    in the @xmath3d counterpart of abc - stacked @xmath0-layer graphene , namely , rhombohedral graphite ( rg ) , the bulk atomic lattice is usually modelled by infinitely many layers .",
    "there is a crossover of lattice symmetry when @xmath0 goes from being finite to being infinite , with a two - atom rhombohedral lattice appearing in rg.@xcite the resulting @xmath4 chiral hamiltonian leads to a @xmath3d dirac cone structure,@xcite where the dirac points ( dps ) form continuous lines in a spiraling fashion in association with a sausage - like fermi surface.@xcite such gapless bulk subbands in rg can be used to explain the @xmath3d qhe observed in graphite,@xcite in which the transport takes place in each layer with @xmath5 charge carriers and the quantization of the conductivity is the same as in monolayer graphene.@xcite this is a general attribute of graphite as a weakly coupled layered system.@xcite the interlayer hopping brings about the described @xmath3d features of the bulk subbands in rg , whereas its much smaller ratio to the intralayer hopping is also responsible for the @xmath6d transport character revealed in the @xmath3d qhe .",
    "indeed , the dimensionality of graphite can be effectively determined by the interplay between the interlayer hopping and the interlayer coulomb interaction,@xcite the latter being absent from the single - particle hamiltonian . in this regard",
    ", the @xmath3d nature of the dirac cone structure in rg has been verified by the existence of optical magnetoplasmons in the presence of that interplay.@xcite    the non - trivial topology uniquely endowed in the abc stack of graphene layers leads to a bulk - surface correspondence in rg,@xcite just as the bulk - edge correspondence in monolayer graphene with zigzag edges.@xcite the topological stability against perturbative disturbance such as impurities and crystal deformations is ensured by the dp spirals , which are nodal lines just as the dps are nodal points in monolayer graphene.@xcite consequently , rg possesses metallic flat surface subbands while being semimetallic in the bulk with a 3d dirac cone structure . as such , rg can be compared to certain topological insulators , e.g. , bi@xmath7se@xmath8 and bi@xmath7te@xmath8 , which are also abc - stacked layered materials.@xcite    since the physics arising from abc - stacking configuration is so rich and deep , it is of interest to investigate the band structure of abc - stacked @xmath0-layer graphene ranging from @xmath6d to @xmath3d realm .",
    "recently , first - principle calculations simultaneously taking into account the surface and the bulk states have been performed with a number of layers up to @xmath9 , showing that the bulk subbands are still gapped.@xcite a recursive analysis has been achieved for infinite @xmath0,@xcite and the resulting density of states ( dos ) and landau level spectrum are the same as in monolayer graphene in agreement with the @xmath3d dirac cone structure.@xcite it is therefore reasonable to envisage a dimensional crossover from the gapped bulk subbands to the @xmath3d dirac cone structure .",
    "nevertheless , to our knowledge the evolution has not been ever explicitly studied in spite that similar studies of ab stacks have been conducted.@xcite    in this paper , we analytically calculate the bulk subbands in abc - stacked @xmath0-layer graphene by deriving and using an expression for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate their evolution in the increase of @xmath0 and dimensional crossover in the infinite limit of @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "we describe the model and construct a @xmath6d non - perturbative effective hamiltonian closed in the bulk subspace so as to treat the coupling to the surface subbands .",
    "the obtained bulk subbands are certain @xmath6d projections from the @xmath3d dirac cone structure in rg . in sec . , we describe how to resolve a second - order recursion involved in the eigenvalue problem of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "then we derive the expression of the eigenenergies and bulk dos . in sec .",
    ", at first we analyze the bulk subbands and demonstrate their evolution together with the well understood surface subbands .",
    "then we elucidate the dimensional crossover .",
    "finally , we give in sec . a summary with an outlook .    0.6 truecm",
    "0.1 truecm    the lattice of abc - stacked @xmath0-layer graphene is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , where graphene layers infinitely extended in the @xmath10 plane and stacked along the @xmath11 direction are labeled by @xmath12 , @xmath6 , ... , @xmath0 , with the lattice constant of a single layer @xmath13 nm and interlayer distance @xmath14 nm . carbon atoms in this configuration are classified into to two sets .",
    "one set contains the sublattices of surface atoms ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) ; the other contains the sublattices of the bulk atoms .",
    "each bulk atom is vertically bonded with another one that is located in either the adjacent upper or the adjacent lower layer .",
    "in the two outermost layers the surface atoms are free from such bonding . a solid view in fig .",
    "1(b ) illustrates that infinitely many abc - stacked graphene layers are taken to model the bulk of rg , which has a two - atom rhombohedral primitive unit cell .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , for reference , is an alternatively set hexagonal non - primitive unit cell of triple volume , which is also the primitive unit cell in abc - stacked trilayer graphene",
    ".    from abc - stacked graphene@xcite to rg,@xcite there always exist coupled surface and bulk subbands , respectively localized at the surface and the bulk atomic sublattices .",
    "the conventional tight - binding ( tb ) model is set forth in fig .",
    "1(a),@xcite where those nearest - neighbor electron hoppings are shown .",
    "the bulk subbands have been known to correspond to the @xmath6d projection of a dp spiral surrounds the @xmath17 point of the @xmath6d hexagonal brillouin zone ( bz),@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "the projection is close to the annular valleys that are present in the bulk subbands in abc - stacked graphene.@xcite a @xmath3d rhombohedral - to-@xmath6d hexagonal zone - folding relation could be in principle figured out to obtain the @xmath6d bulk subbands .",
    "however , one can not do a straight folding along the stacking direction ( @xmath18 ) here as one does for ab - stacked graphite.@xcite .",
    "this fact can be understood since the vertical line through @xmath17 is no longer a symmetry line in the @xmath3d rhombohedral bz.@xcite we shall derive a @xmath6d effective hamiltonian in the bulk subspace , which is used together with the well realized effective hamiltonian in the surface subspace.@xcite the evolution and dimensional crossover can be clarified once the eigenenergies are solved out for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "such methodology using subspace effective hamiltonians has been applied to study ab - stacked @xmath0-layer graphene,@xcite for which the subband indices are directly related to the projections of the @xmath3d band structure at allowed @xmath18 , in consistency with the vertical zone - folding scheme.@xcite although a direct relation between the bulk subband index and @xmath18 is not accessible for abc - stacked @xmath0-layer graphene , it is rational to relate the indices to certain @xmath6d projections from the @xmath3d dirac cone structure at all allowed @xmath19 in the @xmath3d rhombohedral bz .",
    "the hexagonal bz of the stack of @xmath0 layers becomes extremely thinned as @xmath0 goes infinitely large , so that we have an approximately zero extent in the @xmath18 dimension .",
    "hence , the continuum of projections forming a bulk zone in the @xmath6d hexagonal bz is acquired .",
    "the model is described as follows . referring to fig .",
    "1(a ) , the nearest interlayer hopping , @xmath20 , takes place between the vertically bonded bulk atoms in adjacent layers .",
    "those interlayer hoppings other than @xmath20 alter the surface subbands but they only perturb the bulk subbands.@xcite the minimal model including only @xmath20(@xmath21 ev ) and the nearest intralayer hopping @xmath22(@xmath23 ev ) suffices for our purpose .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath24 , based on the tb bloch functions @xmath25 with respect to the @xmath26 sublattices , is represented as @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the momentum measured from @xmath17 and @xmath31 are the valley index for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",

    "it is noted that within the minimal model , the dp spiral is laid on a cylinder surface around the verticle line through @xmath17 and therefore its @xmath6d projection becomes a circle around @xmath17.@xcite for the scale of @xmath35 , we remark the radius of the projected dp spiral@xcite @xmath36 this delimits the boundary of the non - trivial topology for the bulk - surface correspondence.@xcite    the hamiltonian @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is partitioned as follows .",
    "the upper left @xmath4 block is denoted by @xmath37 with respect to the surface subspace spanned by @xmath38 , and the lower right @xmath39 block is @xmath40 for the bulk subspace spanned by the bulk sublattices . the coupling between @xmath37 and @xmath40 is given by the off - diagonal blocks @xmath41 and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to identify the surface subbands as being lower in energy than the bulk subbands .",
    "the secular equation reduces to @xmath43 at @xmath32 , where the coupling is absent since @xmath41 and @xmath44 are zero matrices with @xmath45 .",
    "the lowest eigenenergy @xmath46 is associated with two degenerate eigenstates in the surface subspace , while the eigenenergies @xmath47 are each associated with @xmath48 degenerate eigenstates in the bulk subspace .",
    "our goal is to construct an effective hamiltonian in the bulk subspace and solve the eigenvalues for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "that is , a block diagonalization for the full hamiltonian @xmath24 is required : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the effective hamiltonians in the surface and the bulk subspaces , respectively .",

    "this might be deemed the price for the reduction in dimension .",
    "an effective hamiltonian can even be non - hermitian in general , but this is not the case here . at first sight",
    ", a perturbation calculation is expected as usual .",
    "unfortunately , divergence of the perturbation series would be encountered if the coupling is strong compared with a diminishing bulk energy gap as envisaged here for infinitely large @xmath0 .",
    "we shall take a non - perturbative approach below , which is accessible owing to the specific form of eq.s ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "it is noted that the similarity transformation for the block diagonalization is not unique in general , while different effective hamiltonians obtained through different transformations yield the same eigenvalues .",
    "the surface subbands have been well realized by the chiral effective hamiltonian @xmath71 for abc - stacked trilayer graphene.@xcite this can be obtained in the present framework by removing the @xmath70-dependence due to the powers of @xmath72 in the coupling term of @xmath50 in eq .",
