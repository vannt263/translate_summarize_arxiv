    "dwarf novae are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , which are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf secondary transferring matter via the roche - lobe overflow ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "there exists a class of dwarf novae , called su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "all su uma - type dwarf novae show superhumps during their long , bright outbursts ( superoutbursts ) .",
    "[ for a recent review of dwarf novae and su uma - type dwarf novae , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively . ]",
    "superhumps are 0.10.5 mag modulations which have periods ( superhump period : @xmath5 ) a few percent longer than the system orbital period ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is understood as a consequence of the apsidal motion @xcite of a tidally induced eccentric accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the origin of superhumps is explained as increased viscous dissipation around periodic conjunctions between the major axis of the elongated accretion disk and the secondary star .",
    "this explanation has been recently confirmed with more detailed hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite indeed succeeded in reproducing the light curves of dwarf novae with hydrodynamical simulations within the thermal - tidal disk instability model @xcite .",
    "early development in study of su uma - type dwarf novae largely owed to southern bright objects ( vw hyi , z cha , oy car etc .",
    "see e.g. @xcite ) with dedicated telescopes .",
    "the recent advent of the wide availability of ccds , however , has opened a new window to study of su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "excellent examples include ( a ) an extension to faint objects ( e.g. @xcite ) and ( b ) timely observations of su uma - type outbursts .",
    "these new techniques have produced a number of striking discoveries or new concepts : e.g. recognition of a class of short - period , rarely outbursting su uma - type dwarf novae @xcite , establishment the concept of wz sge - type dwarf novae @xcite , discovery of peculiar er uma - type stars @xcite , and discovery of ultra - short period su uma - type dwarf novae breaking the standard evolutionary sequence of short - period cvs @xcite .",
    "these discoveries have dramatically changed our understanding of cvs . in recent years , @xcite applied a technique of time - resolved ccd photometry , which was largely introduced by @xcite , to the previously unexploited field of faint southern cvs , and has indeed proven the high productivity of such a study .    in the most recent years",
    ", the advent of the internet , wide availability of ccds and a global network of observers , best exemplified by the vsnet collaboration has enabled a rapid circulation of outburst alerts and opened a new window to globally and timely study the novel field of _ transient object astronomy_. combined with the established technique of time - resolved ccd photometry of outbursting dwarf novae , this kind of global collaboration has become a breakthrough in study of cvs ( a wealth of scientific highlights is presented on the vsnet webpage ) . in this paper , we present the very first result of this global network on newly discovered outbursts of southern cvs .",
