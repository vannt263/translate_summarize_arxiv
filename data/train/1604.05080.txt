    "in the modern landscape of information technology machine learning is gaining more and more in importance .",
    "major companies use artificial intelligence for their products @xcite .",
    "this development is driven by advancements in methods such as deep learning @xcite that were originally inspired by concepts from neuroscience .",
    "together with the availability of substantial computational performance , these methods enable complex machine learning applications , such as image @xcite or speech recognition @xcite . specialized hardware can lower the cost of these methods in terms of energy , time , and therefore money @xcite , enabling either a scaling to larger problem sizes or the use in new devices outside of data centers .    this opens the opportunity to build specialized hardware systems that serve as efficient platforms for research as well as technology .",
    "multiple systems with this goal have been proposed , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "while the problem can be approached in different ways , the concept of analog neuromorphic hardware @xcite promises especially area and energy efficient solutions as demonstrated by e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these systems use the concept of a physical model to emulate neural networks : the temporal development of the membrane voltages of the neurons is emulated by custom analog circuits , representing the neuron and synapses of the emulated network .",
    "however , neurons and synapses built this way are limited to at best a family of models that are compatible with their physical realization . on the other end of the spectrum",
    ", software allows the simulation of arbitrary models by solving numerical equations .",
    "this is true for technical applications where one network is often trained with different methods for pre - training and fine - tuning @xcite , as well as biology where different plasticity rules are found depending on cell type and brain region @xcite .",
    "but besides flexibility , efficiency is a key concern in both domains .",
    "large - scale simulations have been demonstrated in the past @xcite , but , especially with plasticity , simulation time quickly becomes a limiting factor even on medium - sized networks @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the technical domain , significant effort is put into accelerating learning including the use of and @xcite .    for this study",
    ", we follow a novel hybrid approach to learning as a trade - off between efficiency and flexibility : we use full - custom analog circuits for real - time and parallel processing of spikes in the emulated synapses .",
    "these circuits serve as sensors for an embedded general - purpose processor that implements the learning rule in software . this way ,",
    "we offer a solution that allows biologically realistic plasticity while emulating networks a thousand times faster than in biology . using physical models for core components ,",
    "this speed - up is not affected by network size or activity . in this study we present results from a scaled - down prototype that demonstrates for the first time plasticity in such a hybrid system using analog components together with an embedded .",
    "the study starts with a description of analog circuits and the architecture of the in section  [ sec : circuits ] .",
    "after that , we introduce the theoretical background and methods in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "then , results are presented for simulations in section  [ sec : sim ] and for experiments in section  [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : discussion ] discusses results , followed by conclusion and outlook in sections  [ sec : conclusion ] and  [ sec : outlook ] .",
    "the circuits presented in this paper are part of a prototype asic for the next generation of a large neuromorphic hardware system @xcite .",
    "all results have been measured using the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : board ] .",
    "the individual components of the chip and their functional relations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] .",
    "the central elements are an array of 2048 synapses and 64 neuron - compartment circuits , which implement the analog , continuous - time emulation of their biological counterparts .",
    "similar to the predecessor system described in @xcite the presented chip operates faster than . to simplify the calibration of the analog elements to the model equations ,",
    "the acceleration factor is fixed at @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , one second in the model time scale is emulated in one millisecond by .",
    "the focus of this paper is the plasticity sub - system , which observes the activity of the emulated neural network and modifies its parameters in reaction to these observations depending on the configured plasticity rule .",
    "the neuron circuits are not covered in this publication .",
    "the plasticity sub - system is a mixed - signal , highly - parallel control loop simultaneously monitoring the temporal correlation between all pre- and post - synaptic firing times .",
    "the plasticity rule itself is implemented as software running on an embedded micro - processor , the .",
    "it evaluates the signals from the analog correlation sensors located within the synapses and computes weight updates . besides the synapse",
    ", it can observe firing rates of neurons and modify parameters of the emulated neurons as well as the topology of the network .",
    "connection to the outside world allows the integration of third factors , for example a reward signal @xcite .",
    "the parallel analog implementation of the correlation sensors in every synapse allows the plasticity sub - system to handle the high rate of simultaneous events every component has to handle a thousandfold higher data rate as a comparable . ]",
    "the circuit maintains a local eligibility trace that depends on the relative timing of pre- and post - synaptic firing .",
    "a 128 channel single - slope digitizes the stored trace information for the .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] the synapses are arranged in a two - dimensional array between the and the neuron compartment circuits .",
    "pre - synaptic input enters the synapse array at the left edge . for each row ,",
    "a set of signal buffers transmit the pre - synaptic pulses to all synapses in the row . the post - synaptic side of the synapses , i.e. the equivalent of the dendritic membrane of the target neuron , is formed by wires running vertically through each column of synapses .    at each intersection between pre- and post - synaptic wires ,",
    "a synapse is located . to avoid that all neuron compartments share the same set of pre - synaptic inputs , each pre - synaptic input line transmits - in a time - multiplexed fashion - the pre - synaptic signals of up to 64 different pre - synaptic neurons .",
    "each synapse stores a pre - synaptic address that determines the pre - synaptic neuron it responds to .",
    "[ fig : synapse_block ] shows a block diagram of the synapse circuit .",
    "the main functional blocks are the address comparator , the and the correlation sensor .",
    "each of these circuits has its associated memory block .",
    "the address comparator receives a address and a pre - synaptic enable signal if the address matches the programmed neuron number , the comparator circuit generates a pre - synaptic enable signal local to the synapse ( _ pre _ ) , which is subsequently used in the and correlation sensor circuits .",
    "each time the circuit receives a _",
    "pre _ signal , it generates a current pulse .",
    "the height of this pulse is proportional to the stored weight , while the pulse width is typically .",
    "this matches the maximum pre - synaptic input rate of the whole synapse row which is limited to .",
    "the remaining are necessary to change the pre - synaptic address .",
    "the current pulse can be shortened below the maximum pulse length to emulate short - term synaptic plasticity @xcite .",
    "each neuron compartment has two inputs , labeled a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : synapse_block ] . usually , the neuron compartment uses a as excitatory and b as inhibitory input .",
    "each row of synapses is statically switched to either input a or b , meaning that all pre - synaptic neurons connected to this row act either as excitatory or inhibitory inputs to their target neurons . due to the address width of the maximum number of different pre - synaptic neurons is 64 .    the remaining block shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : synapse_block ] is the correlation sensor , which has a static memory associated with it .",
    "its task is the measurement of the time difference between pre- and post - synaptic spikes . to determine the time of the pre - synaptic spike it is connected to the _ pre _ signal .",
    "the post - synaptic spike - time is determined by a dedicated signaling line running from each neuron compartment vertically through the synapse array to connect to all synapses projecting to inputs a or b of the compartment .",
    "this signal , which is called _ post _ subsequently , has a similar pulse length as the _ pre _ signal .    the correlation sensor measures the causal ( _ pre _ before _ post _ ) and anti - causal ( _ post _ before _ pre _ ) time differences and stores them as exponentially weighted sums within the synapse circuit . in comparison to earlier implementations",
    "@xcite by the authors the circuit has been improved in two main aspects : first , only one instance of the time measurement circuit is now re - used for causal as well as anti - causal time difference measurements , resulting in strongly reduced mismatch between the causal and anti - causal branches of the activation function .",
    "second , the time - constant of the exponential is now truly adjustable over more than two orders of magnitude to fit most biological models of spike - time dependent plasticity @xcite .",
    ".key parameters of the synapse circuit [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]          with the individual channels characterized , the next step is to look at the full signal processing chain .",
    "we use the experimental protocol described in section  [ sec : theory ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stdproto ] . the performs weight updates according to ( [ eqn : wup ] ) . to eliminate trial - to - trial noise on the analog readout and to remove systematic offset between the two channels of one synapse",
    ", we modify ( [ eqn : a ] ) to @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is determined at program startup after reset of the accumulation storage as difference @xmath4 .",
    "( [ eqn : aexp ] ) implements thresholding using the user selected parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the performs updates at regular intervals of @xmath6{\\mu s}$ ] during stimulation .",
    "the source code for the actually used update program is available from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured ] shows results when using resolution for arithmetics . for analysis ,",
    "two functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are individually fitted to pre - before - post ( @xmath9 ) and post - before - pre ( @xmath10 ) data : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the fit parameters , while initial weight @xmath14 and maximum weight @xmath15 are the same as those used by the update program . in all experiments we set @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the threshold @xmath5 was set to @xmath19 .",
    "since discretization of the weight removes the long tail of the exponential , the fit is restricted to points where the weight was actually changed ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured]a - c demonstrate different combinations of @xmath21 and @xmath14 . especially for small updates ,",
    "the discretization of the weight to is apparent .",
    "results exhibit the expected dependency on @xmath14 for a multiplicative rule . fig .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured]d , e plot the fitted parameters for amplitude ( @xmath12 ) and time - constant ( @xmath13 ) over the number of spike pairs @xmath21 .",
    "as expected , amplitude increases linearly with the number of pairs and for the chosen initial weight @xmath22 positive changes are larger than negative ones .",
    "the process that measures the timing of spike pairs in the synapse operates on individual pairs and is therefore independent of @xmath21 .",
    "also , the circuit for time measurement is shared for pre - before - post and post - before - pre pairs within one synapse .",
    "therefore , time - constants should be identical on both sides and independent of @xmath21 .",
    "experimental data is compatible with these expectations as fig .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured]e shows .",
    "for small @xmath21 the fit is not reliable due to discretization ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ppumeasured]b ) .    the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured]f - i give a hint of the achievable flexibility .",
    "they were produced with the same stimulation protocol only by changes in software running on the .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured]f , g show symmetrical hebbian and anti - hebbian rules .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured]h is only sensitive to pre - before - post pairings .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured]i realizes bi - stable learning .      during execution of the experiment described in the previous section",
    ", digital logic consumes below of power as measured on the power supply pins of the chip . with the clock disabled for the",
    ", power consumption drops below , so that can be attributed to the . in reset power consumption drops by for the .",
    "therefore , power consumption is largely due to clock distribution .",
    "the two overarching goals in the development of neuromorphic hardware are to provide a platform for neuroscientific experiments and to find new ways of computation for technical applications . for both these goals we believe reliability , scalability , and flexibility to",
    "be enabling factors besides efficiency in terms of power , area , and speed .",
    "therefore , the presented results focus on these aspects .      to assess reliability we characterized the synapse behavior across three different chips ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : variation ] and  [ fig : ranges ] ) .",
    "results show substantial variation due to device mismatch within the analog circuits .",
    "please note , that for these measurements the configuration bits of the synapse circuit were not even used ( see section  [ sec : circ : synapse ] ) .",
    "so there is room for improvements through calibration . on the other hand ,",
    "trial - to - trial variability of individual components is small .",
    "this is for example illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ranges ] that shows multiple trials from a single synapse on the background of the overall distribution of synapses .",
    "a small trial - to - trial variability was also measured for individual channels in section  [ sec : var ] .",
    "this allows on the one hand to use off - line calibration , but on the other hand it is also conceivable , that an emulated network calibrates itself through the use of plasticity .",
    "indeed , the robustness of reward - based learning to device mismatch on the correlation detection within the processor - based approach presented here has been shown in previous work  @xcite .",
    "self - tuning has also been shown to be feasible through the use of short - term plasticity @xcite .",
    "in general , a plasticity mechanism can compensate inhomogeneities if there is a feedback loop for the parameter subject to variation .",
    "this is typically the case for outputs , e.g.  synaptic weights .",
    "an rule will modify the weight according to the timing behavior it observes , which is an effect of the weight including variation .",
    "variation on the input however - in this case the signal @xmath23 from the correlation sensor - is invisible from the rule .",
    "it can however be compensated by introducing additional information about the behavior of the system , for example through a reward signal .",
    "this addition of complementary information is why reward - based learning rules are well suited for analog neuromorphic hardware systems .",
    "the alternative is to use redundancy of analog components so that the average behavior is reliable .",
    "scalability can of course only be shown by actually scaling the system , which we plan to do in the future .",
    "nonetheless , the plasticity system is designed to scale well : the only part for which area scales linearly with the number of synapses is the correlation sensor that resides within the synapse circuit .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to use an area - optimized circuit realized as analog full - custom design .",
    "the scales with the number of columns in the synapse array , which have typically a square root dependency on the number of synapses .",
    "most parts of the are required only once per array and only the number of vector slices scales with the number of columns . to keep these slices as lightweight as possible ,",
    "all control logic is shared and a single - port vector register file is used .",
    "a scaled system will feature arrays of @xmath24 synapses with a dedicated using 8 vector slices .",
    "the whole approach presented here has a strong emphasis on flexibility . by this we mean , that a large number of plasticity rules should be implementable in the hardware system . introducing the sacrifices area and power in order to have as much freedom as possible while not sacrificing speed . to achieve this latter point in the technology",
    ", we consider a combination of analog and software - based processing , as shown in this study , to be necessary . at a speed - up factor of @xmath1 and",
    "array sizes of 65k synapses it is not feasible to process individual spike events in software .",
    "this of course limits flexibility as the functionality of the correlation sensor is fixed in hardware .",
    "therefore , this functionality should at least operate over a wide range of parameters in the biological time domain , the design covers ranges from tens to hundreds of milliseconds , fitting typical ranges found in biology @xcite .",
    "also the amplitude is tunable over a large range , so that the sensitivity of the correlation sensor can be matched to the network activity .    in general",
    ", every plasticity model is implementable in this system that depends only on observables visible to the and affects only parameters accessible by the .",
    "observables are the weight @xmath14 , the correlation signals @xmath23 , a firing rate sensor not discussed in this study , and signals from outside the chip such as reward .",
    "all parameters of the chip that can be modified at all , can also be modified by the .",
    "this includes the synaptic weight @xmath14 , neuron parameters , and the topology of the network .",
    "the latter is limited to the addresses stored in the synapses for this prototype chip .",
    "here we only show the simple rule given in ( [ eqn : multstdp ] ) as proof of concept .",
    "[ fig : ppumeasured]f - i show simple examples of modifications of the plasticity model purely realized in software running on the . beyond that , the reward - based learning rule r - stdp and a learning rule for spike - based expectation maximization has been ported to the system , but not yet tested in hardware @xcite .",
    "in this study we have presented a new approach to plasticity in neuromorphic hardware : the combination of dedicated analog circuits in every synapse with a shared digital processor .",
    "it represents a trade - off between flexibility of implementable plasticity models and efficiency of the implementation in terms of area , speed , and energy .",
    "the presented results demonstrate the viability of this approach for plasticity .",
    "the more classical approach taken for neuromorphic hardware , for example by @xcite or @xcite , is to implement a single plasticity mechanism that can be used to solve a range of network learning tasks .",
    "our approach not only aims for flexibility in the learning task , but also in the mechanism itself .",
    "together with the speed - up factor this enables experimental analysis of long - term effects of such mechanisms . in the classical approach it is essential to have a detailed understanding of the mechanism prior to production of hardware . in our approach",
    "the hardware system can help to gain this understanding .",
    "this is an important aspect when designing a system intended as a neuroscientific platform .    in @xcite",
    "this approach is taken even further : neuronal dynamics as well as detection of correlations and weight update are performed by general - purpose processors in software .",
    "specialized hardware is only used for event communication .",
    "this maximizes flexibility but further sacrifices efficiency , so that operation is only possible without speed - up .    our approach to use dedicated hardware for the most expensive part  the processing of spikes",
    " enables faster operation . since learning and development in biology are processes spanning many time - scales , platforms for accelerated simulation or emulation are important . in the domain of general - purpose computers using software simulations even for medium - sized networks accelerated operation with plasticity is currently not possible @xcite .",
    "the chip presented here is still an early prototype that for example lacks on - chip networking capabilities .",
    "however , using the experimental setup described here a wide range of plasticity mechanisms can already be implemented and analyzed in hardware .",
    "obvious candidates are the models already prepared for implementation @xcite .",
    "future prototypes will add the ability to include neuronal and structural plasticity opening the door for a large set of learning mechanisms .",
    "it will then also be possible to execute learning tasks involving networks of neurons with the system .    in the long run",
    ", the focus will be on scaling the system in size . as an intermediate step we plan to build chip - scale variants with two @xmath24 synapse arrays and two . eventually , the goal is to go to wafer - scale @xcite .",
    "it will then replace the first generation of the neuromorphic platform ( nm - pm-1 ) of the human brain project @xcite .",
    "we also hope that the release of the design  the nux processor @xcite  as open source will turn out to be a valuable contribution to open source hardware .",
