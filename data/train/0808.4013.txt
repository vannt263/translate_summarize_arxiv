    "it is well known that the main motivation of introducing extra dimensions is to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "however , there is an alternative motivation in susy brekaing model building , namely the solution to susy flavor problem . in the gravity mediation of four dimensions ,",
    "sfermion masses are generated by contact interactions between the hidden sector fields and the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) fields .",
    "the interactions are in general flavor _",
    "dependent _ since there is no physical symmetry reason to be flavor diagonal , which give rise to an excessive @xmath1 mixing , for example . to suppress these interactions in four dimensions",
    ", we must introduce additional symmetries .",
    "on the other hand , in higher dimensional case , if the hidden sector and mssm sector are separated along the extra dimensions , the above mentioned contact interactions for sfermion masses are forbidden by locality .",
    "then , the dominant sfermion mass is generated by anomaly mediation without susy flavor problem",
    ".    however , this is not the end of the story .",
    "the radius of the compactified dimensions must be stabilized .",
    "although the nontrivial radion potential is generated once susy is broken , it seems not to be stabilized by only the gravity multiplet in the bulk .",
    "thus , we must introduce additional bulk fields to stabilize the radius .",
    "in that situation , we have to check whether these additional bulk fields does not generate flavor violating sfermion masses .    in this talk",
    ", we present a very simple model of the radius stabilization and anomaly mediation dominated susy breaking .",
    "we consider a five - dimensional susy model on the randall - sundrum background , whose metric is @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the radius of @xmath5 of the orbifold @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the @xmath8 curvature scale , and the angle of @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath9 .    as a minimal model to break susy and to stabilize the radius ,",
