    "non - invasive measurements of density are of special importance for stratified fluids experiments . over the last decades numerous optical techniques",
    "were developed @xcite .",
    "for instance , schlieren , shadowgraphy , interferometry , and others , allow for density variation measurements based on the differences in the fluid refractive index @xcite .",
    "progress in digital imaging helped to create the digital counterparts , such as synthetic schlieren methods @xcite .",
    "the refractive index varies as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are the light velocity in the medium and in the vacuum , respectively .",
    "light ray passing through a non - uniform density region is deflected from its original path .",
    "the relation between the density inhomogeneity and the refractive index are defined by gladstone - dale @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gladstone - dale constant , @xmath4 is the wavelength of a light beam and @xmath5 is the density of the fluid @xcite .",
    "the background oriented schlieren belongs to the family of synthetic schlieren methods @xcite .",
    "the bos exploits a light source that projects a textured background ( typically a random pattern of dots ) located on one side of a test chamber onto the camera sensor positioned on the opposite side .",
    "the first image ( called reference image ) is recorded on the background pattern through a stagnant fluid of uniform density . upon fluid motion or density variations , density gradients induce the distortions of the projected pattern compared to the reference image .",
    "the distortions are quantified using optical flow or particle image velocimetry ( piv ) methods , and provide the field of virtual displacements proportional to the derivatives of the index of refraction @xcite .",
    "dalziel and co - authors  @xcite utilized the synthetic schlieren methods to calculate the gradient of the density fluctuations in an air flow around a cylinder . generally , the majority of the bos applications are in aerodynamic applications .",
    "raffel & richard  @xcite performed an intensive bos investigation on the formation and interaction of the blade vortex phenomenon , aiming to reduce the noise generated by a rotor of a helicopter .",
    "validation of the bos technique can be found in venkatakrishnan & meier  @xcite .",
    "the authors compared the 2d - density field of a cone traveling in air at mach 2 with the known cone - charts .",
    "the authors also integrated the field of displacements applying the poisson equation and reconstructed the density field .",
    "recently , bos was extended to three - dimensional measurements for air flows by berger et al .",
    "the authors extended the image processing algorithms to capture time resolved unsteady gas density fields . over the last decade",
    "several studies have focused on the accuracy of the technique .",
    "for instance , elsinga  @xcite and vinnichenko  @xcite tested the influence of various parameters on the measurement sensitivity and resolution of the technique , and suggested a set of guides for an optimal set - up of a bos system .    to the best of our knowledge , the bos measurements in stratified liquid flows are limited to the density gradients only .",
    "for instance , sutherland  @xcite tracked internal waves using the fields of density gradients .",
    "the reconstruction of the density field , based on the poisson equation to the density field , is not found in the literature .    in this study",
    "we note that the distortions arise from the several sources in the multimedia ( air - glass - liquid - glass - air ) imaging , specifically in its digital version . the air - glass - liquid interface with sharp refractive index changes its behavior as a lens that amplifies the optical aberrations of the light source , camera and lenses .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to calibrate the bos optical system through the here proposed multi - step method .",
    "the procedure starts with the bos pattern image through air in the test - section ( air - glass - air - glass - air ) , followed by a homogeneous liquid calibration ( air - glass - liquid - glass - air ) and digital image remapping .",
    "the new multi - step calibration procedure is accompanied by a novel digital image remapping method which corrects the displacements field .",
    "the remapping is based on the displacement field , which is obtained by correlation of the reference image and the image of a homogeneous liquid .",
    "this step is followed by the reference image captured through a stagnant stratified fluid .",
    "the important result of this study is that the calibration and digital image correction allow us to reconstruct the correct density field based on solution of the poisson equation .",
    "we validate the method correctly reconstructing the density of two tests : a ) air - water interface ; and b ) the multi - layer stably stratified saline solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : principles ] we briefly review the relevant principles of the background oriented schlieren method .",
    "section  [ sec : algorithms ] explains the image processing and reconstruction algorithms applied to the experimental data .",
    "section  [ sec : setup ] shows the experimental setup and the experimental results of the two tests .",
    "finally , we summarize the study in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section the basic principles of the bos technique are summarized for the sake of brevity and augmented by an extension that allows reconstructing fluid density in stratified liquids .",
    "the common setup is a background random dots pattern illuminated by a light source and a digital camera facing the light passing the fluid ( gas or liquid ) , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] .",
    "-axis is the imaging axis and @xmath6 are the orthogonal coordinates .",
    "important cross - sections are marked 1 - 6 .",
    "[ fig_system ] ]    the bos technique is based on the distortion of the background image due to density changes . the image is distorted with respect to the reference image of the random pattern , without the fluid .",
    "the distortion is a cumulative effect of the refractive index variation along the light ray passing through the fluid .",
    "the displacement fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be calculated based on the correlation of the reference and the distorted images .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig_displ ] demonstrates the distorted image in our experiment and the corresponding displacement field .    ]",
    "light ray crossing the interface of different indices of refraction changes the direction ( refracts ) proportional to the ratio of the indices , based on snell s law .",
    "consequently , a curvature of the light ray can be approximated as in settles @xcite : @xmath9 integrating eq.([int_1 ] ) for a thickness of a fluid layer , @xmath10 , the deflection angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 are obtained @xcite : @xmath13    when the bos is implemented for gas flows or for the density gradient field , these models are sufficient for further analysis@xcite . however , in the specific case of our interest , light rays refract also at the air - glass , glass - liquid , liquid - glass and glass - air interfaces . according to fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] , it passes through sections 1 - 5 ( number of layers in our case is @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , an extended analysis is required in order to reconstruct the density field . for every layer of air , glass or liquid , of thickness",
    "say @xmath15 , the displacement is estimated according to eq.([int_1 ] ) : @xmath16dz = h_i^{2}\\frac{1}{n_{i}}\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x }   \\ ] ] and @xmath17 obtained equivalently .",
    "the total displacement @xmath18 is the sum of the individual deflections : @xmath19 the following step of the analysis is the reconstruction of the density field based on the poisson equation @xcite : @xmath20\\ ] ] where the multiplier @xmath21 is the inverse of the contributions of different layers : @xmath22^{-1 } \\ ] ] the bos method reverses the use of the poisson equation eq .  [ eq_poisson ] .",
    "the displacements @xmath18 are first obtained for each coordinate @xmath6 using the cross - correlation piv algorithm .",
    "then the gradient of the displacement field is numerically estimated ( using high order accuracy numerical methods ) and the poisson equation is solved for an unknown @xmath23 . in our case the stratified fluid layer index of refraction @xmath24 is the required result .",
    "boundary conditions are necessary for the numerical solution of a partial differential equation .",
    "schematically , the boundary conditions are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_bc ] .     and @xmath25 .",
    "left / right conditions are neumann type @xmath26 and @xmath27 [ fig_bc ] ]    eventually , the gladstone - dale relation ( @xmath2 ) is used to transform the field of @xmath28 to the density field @xmath29 .",
    "literature reviews revealed the difficulty to implement the synthetic schlieren method to the stratified fluids .",
    "we have identified that the key problem relates to the multi - media imaging path .",
    "the method proposed here is called an image remapping method .",
    "the method utilizes a multi - step calibration and image processing routine known as remapping .",
    "remapping is the shift of each pixel in the image by a distance prescribed by the displacement field .",
    "two reference images are captured when the tank is full with air and water ( or another liquid of a uniform index of refraction , close to the final solution ) .",
    "liquid in the tank causes an apparent displacement of the dots ( referred to the initial image ) in the image recorded by the camera . in short ,",
    "the method explained here separates the result from this apparent distortion using calibration .",
    "the order of the steps are shown in a block diagram in fig.[fig_flowchart ] :    * we capture three images of the background pattern , through air @xmath30 , water @xmath31 and a saline stratified solution , @xmath32 .",
    "( @xmath33 stands for image ) . *",
    "the first calibration is the displacement field @xmath18 obtained correlating the air and water images , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a convolution operator and subscript @xmath36 is the conjugate ( reversed ) image . *",

    "[ fig_table_cor ] .",
    "the left plot shows the displacement field @xmath18 as arrows .    ]",
    "the plot emphasizes a typical distortion created by the multi - media imaging of the background pattern .",
    "the displacement field is quantified by cross - correlating the air and water images , @xmath38 and @xmath31 .",
    "the two images were analyzed using a standard fft - based correlation method with an interrogation area of @xmath41 pixels@xmath42 .",
    "the magnitude of the displacement field @xmath43 is shown as contours in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig_table_cor ] .",
    "the maximum displacement is tens of pixels and it is larger at the edges of the image .",
    "note that we present the whole field measurement method and the image corresponds to the field of approximately @xmath44 cm@xmath42 .",
    "seventy pixels distortion is not visible in the four megapixel image .",
    "however , we understand that since the poisson equation utilizes the integration from the edges of boundary conditions , the error propagates to the place where the result is important .    in order to correct the image distortion ,",
    "the image remapping code was developed .",
    "first , a calibration field is obtained by correlating the reference image and the image of the background pattern through the full tank of water , @xmath31 . in the following stage , this calibration field",
    "is used to correct the distortion generated by the saline water image .",
    "the calibration vector field is re - sampled on a dense rectangular mesh grid using linear interpolation .",
    "the resulting new field is then applied to each pixel of the saline solution image using the standard image remapping method : @xmath46 ( @xmath47 denotes the transform map ) .",
    "it remaps each pixel of the distorted image , inverting the displacement field of the calibration image .",
    "the effect of remapping is not significant and therefore not easily visualized .",
    "we demonstrated the contour maps of displacement fields with and without correction for the : a ) air - water case ; and b ) multi - layer stratified solutions in fig .",

    "the original , not remapped results , are shown by solid contours and the corrected ones by the dashed lines .",
    "the contour maps are very similar .",
    "nevertheless , as we explained above , the error accumulates during the solution of the poisson equation .",
    "as the next section shows , the results are very significant for the reconstructed density field .    , scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "the experiments are performed in a glass tank with a @xmath48 @xmath49 cross - section and a height of 30 cm .",
    "the random dot pattern is created using a matlab script ( makebospattern.m courtesy of frederic moisy , http://www.fast.u-psud.fr/pivmat ) .",

    "the transparent sheet with a background pattern was attached at the back - side of the tank .",
    "it is illuminated with a white led light , equipped with a plastic light diffusing sheet .",
    "the light distribution is approximately uniform .",
    "the non - uniformity of the light due to the lack of parabolic mirrors in the digital bos application is corrected by the proposed method .",
    "the imaging system uses a four megapixel ccd camera ( optronis cl4000cxp ) with a 10-bit sensor of @xmath50 pixels that yields a magnification of 56.2 @xmath51m / pixel .",
    "all the bos image pairs were processed similarly to the piv images ( in the present case using fft - based cross - correlation of @xmath52 pixels ) .",
    "we present here two important tests , namely test i and ii . in test",
    "i , we use the reference image in air @xmath38 only , and implement the method to obtain the position of the air - water interface and reconstruct the density of the two fluids .",
