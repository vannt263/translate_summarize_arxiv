    "in an interesting turn of events , srsic s ( 1963 , 1968 ) 3-parameter function , developed to describe the projected ( on the plane of the sky ) radial stellar distributions of galaxies , has been shown to also match the internal ( 3d ) density profiles of simulated dark matter halos ( navarro et al .",
    "intriguingly , this function was shown to provide a better fit than the 3-parameter nfw - like model with arbitrary inner power - law slope ( diemand , moore , & stadel 2004 ; merritt et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the functional form of srsic s equation was independently developed by einasto ( 1965 , 1968 , 1969 ) and used to describe the internal density profiles of galaxies ( see also einasto & haud 1989 and tenjes , haud , & einasto 1994 ) .",
    "we shall therefore refer to this function as the srsic model when applied to projected distributions , and as the einasto model when applied to internal density profiles .",
    "one of the main concerns in ( merritt et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) was whether the deprojected form of srsic s function might provide a better description of the density profiles than the einasto model .",
    "specifically , in merritt et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter paper i ) , the analytical approximation to the deprojection of srsic s function given in prugniel & simien ( 1997 ) was tested along with the einasto model , the nfw - like model , and various other fitting functions .",
    "overall , the prugniel - simien and einasto models performed the best , providing a good description to both the galaxy- and cluster - sized halos built from hierarchical @xmath10-body simulations , and also the monolithic cold collapse halos . curiously , while the prugniel - simien model provided the best fit to the cluster - sized halos , einasto s model provided a better fit to the galaxy - sized halos . in this paper",
    "we explore some of the properties of these two models and some of the consequences they imply , and comparisons they enable , with real galaxies and galaxy clusters .    in an effort to help clarify and unify the various parameters of the different models , section  2 provides relations between such quantities as effective radius @xmath11 , virial radius @xmath12 , the radius where the logarithmic slope of the model equals @xmath8 , @xmath13 , and ` concentration ' as measured by observers and by modelers .",
    "in section  [ seccube ] we present the phase - space density profiles , or more specifically , the density profiles divided by the cube of their associated velocity dispersion profiles , showing how , for sufficiently large shape parameters @xmath14 , both the einasto model and the prugniel - simien model approximate a power - law @xmath15 near @xmath13 .    in section  [ secslope ]",
    "we derive the logarithmic slopes of the einasto and prugniel - simien model , and compare these with real data .",
    "this is of particular interest because the innermost slope of these models is considerably shallower than @xmath16 and in fact equal to zero in the case of the einasto model at @xmath17 .",
    "the inward extrapolation of these models , rather than the nfw - like model , therefore noticeably reduces the disagreement between modelers and observers on this issue .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ secsum ] .",
    "we will discuss three ( 3-parameter ) empirical models used for describing the internal density profiles of galaxies , clusters , and halos .",
    "each model has three parameters and their application to simulated halos can be seen in paper i.    the first model is an adaptation of the navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 , hereafter nfw ) model to give a double power - law with an outer slope of @xmath18 and an arbitrary inner slope denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the radial density profile , @xmath7 , of this model can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scale radius at the density @xmath22 , marking the center of the transition between the inner and outer power - laws with ( extrapolated ) slopes of @xmath23 and @xmath18 .",
    "this function represents a restricted form of the more generic ( @xmath24 ) model ( hernquist 1990 , his equation  43 ; see also zhao 1996 ) and we shall refer to it as the ( @xmath25 ) model . setting ( @xmath24)=(1 , 3 , 1 )",
    "yields the nfw model , while ( 1.5 , 3 , 1.5 ) gives the model in moore et al .",
    "because the ( @xmath25 ) model has already been studied in detail , our main focus will be on the models of einasto ( 1965 ) and prugniel & simien ( 1997 ) .",

    "larger values of @xmath14 result in steeper inner profiles and shallower outer profiles .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is defined to be a function of @xmath14 such that @xmath28 is the density at the _ effective _ radius @xmath29 which encloses a volume containing half of the total mass .",
    "a good approximation for @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 ( mamon 2005 , priv comm . ) , although we have used the exact value coming from @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the incomplete and complete gamma functions , respectively ( see paper i ) .",

    "the quantity @xmath39 is a function of @xmath14 defined in such a way that @xmath11 is the _ effective _ radius containing half of the total mass when the 3d sphere defined by this density profile is seen in projection onto a 2d plane .",
    "although we use the exact solution for @xmath39 , coming from @xmath40 ( see graham & driver 2005 ) , @xmath39 can be approximated by @xmath41 for values of @xmath42 ( prugniel & simien 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to @xmath14 and @xmath11 , the third parameter which one solves for , @xmath43 , is defined so that the volume - integrated mass from equation  [ eqps97 ] is equal to the area - integrated mass of a srsic function with the standard parameter set @xmath44 and @xmath14 ( see paper i ) .",
    "the final term @xmath45 is not a parameter but instead , like @xmath39 , another function of @xmath14 .",
    "it is chosen to maximize the agreement between the prugniel - simien model and the deprojected srsic model having the same parameters @xmath14 and @xmath11 .",
    "a good match is obtained when @xmath46 ( lima neto et al .",
    "1999 ; see also paper i , their figure 13 ) . the value of @xmath45 is also responsible for determining the logarithmic profile slope at small radii . setting @xmath45 to zero , the prugniel - simien model has the same functional form as einasto s model .",
    "the internal density of the prugniel - simien model at @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 , and the projected surface density at @xmath49 , denoted by @xmath50 , can be solved for using equation  [ projie ] .",
    "comparisons of dark matter halos ( fitted with the prugniel - simien model ) with real galaxies ( fitted with srsic s model ) is obviously remarkably easy using this model . the associated mass profile ( lima neto et al .",
    "1999 ; mrquez et al .",
    "2001 ) is given by the equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "expressions for the associated gravitational potential , force , and velocity dispersion can be found in terzi & graham 2005 ) . in what follows ,",
    "we shall at times refer to the value of @xmath14 from the prugniel - simien model as @xmath53 .    in the following subsections we explore a number of important radii associated with the above models , and",
    "address the issue of ` concentration ' .",
    "as will be discussed in section  [ secslope ] , the scale radii @xmath29 of the einasto model , and the ( projected ) half - mass radii @xmath57 from the prugniel - simien model , occur where the logarithmic slope of the density profile is @xmath58 .",
    "this can be quite far out , and so we define an additional radial scale .",
    "we do so by obtaining the radius where the profile @xmath59 , which has units of velocity squared , has its maximum .",
    "the integral of this profile gives the enclosed mass .",
    "for the ( 1 , 3 , @xmath19 ) model ( equation  [ eqnfw ] ) , this maximum occurs at a radius that we denote by @xmath60 , such that @xmath61 when @xmath62 , as in the nfw model , the radius @xmath63 , and when @xmath64 one has @xmath65 .",
    "it turns out that the radius @xmath60 corresponds to the point where the logarithmic slope of the ( 1 , 3 , @xmath19 ) density profile equals @xmath8 , hence the adopted nomenclature .",
    "similarly for the einasto and prugniel - simien density model , solving where the derivative of the profile @xmath54 equals zero , one finds that these profiles also peak at the radius where their logarithmic slope equals @xmath8 .",
    "this is easy to understand when one notes that the solution to @xmath66/{\\rm d}r = 0 $ ] leads to @xmath67 .",
    "it is also easy to show that this corresponds to a maximum for any density profile with a monotonically decreasing slope . for einasto s model ( equation  [ serden ] )",

    "when @xmath93 ( and 2.9 ) in the prugniel - simien model  the average profile shape for our galaxy - sized ( and cluster - sized ) cdm halos , see paper  i  @xmath94 2.17 @xmath13 ( and 2.10 @xmath13 ) . when @xmath95 ( and 5.0 ) in the einasto model , @xmath94 2.21 @xmath13 ( and 2.16 @xmath13 ) .",
    "this can be compared with the ( @xmath96 ) nfw model for which @xmath4 is known to equal @xmath97 2.16 @xmath13 .",
    "given the re - newed application of einasto s model , which has the same functional form as srsic s model that is used by observers in describing projected distributions , it would seem relevant to inquire if we can also make use of the type of concentration indices that observers use .",
    "there are two flavors .",
    "the first is a ratio of two radii .",
    "while this may sound qualitatively similar to the nfw concentration , it is in fact fundamentally different .",
    "a classical example would be the ratio between the radii containing 50% and 25% of a galaxy s total light ( fraser 1972 ) . in the case of a universal density profile , with only a radial scale and a density scale",
    ", the ratio of radii containing 50% and 25% of the total ( asymptotic ) mass would always be exactly the same .",
    "that is , if we were to use the new concentration index @xmath98 , then if @xmath14 is assumed to be constant ( i.e. , if a universal profile exists ) , this ratio will be the same for every profile ( see equations  [ serr2 ] and [ psr2 ] ) .",
    "a similar example comes from butcher & oemler ( 1984 ) who defined a galaxy cluster concentration index @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the radius enclosing @xmath101% of the galaxies in a cluster .",
    "the second type of concentration index is a ratio of flux , compared to a ratio of radii , within two specified radii ( okamura , kodaira , & watanabe 1984 ) .",
    "an example is the flux within the radius containing half an object s total light divided by the flux within one third of this radius ( trujillo , graham , & caon 2001 ) .",
    "but again , if the density profiles are universal , then such concentration indices will always have the same value .",
    "it is because real galaxies do not have universal light - profiles , i.e.  a range of srsic ( @xmath102 ) indices are observed , that such concentrations indices work .",
    "abraham et al .  ( 1994 ) used a galaxy concentration index defined as the ratio of flux within the radius containing an object s total light ( rather than half its light ) divided by the flux within 1/3 of this radius . now because , in general , galaxies do not have well - defined edges but rather their light slowly peters out into the noise of the sky - background flux , deeper and deeper exposures yield increasingly larger total radii , and a flux ratio that tends to 1 for every galaxy . but because of the limited aperture sizes abraham et al .  ( 1994 ) used to define the total galaxy light , they obtained values different than 1 .",
    "the quantity they measured was thus a function of not only the light - profile shape , but how many @xmath11 they sampled in their largest aperture , as discussed in graham , trujillo , & caon ( 2001 ) .    in a somewhat similar manner , the nfw concentration works because it too is dependent on the background noise , specifically , the mean matter density of the universe . the virial radius , @xmath12 , is used to quantify the density of dark matter halos relative to the background .",
    "it is defined as the radius of a sphere containing an average matter density that is some specific number greater than the mean matter density in the universe . in paper",
    "i we reported that our simulated halo profiles were computed using a value of 368 .",
    "it is however common to also see a value of @xmath97337 when @xmath103 , and @xmath104 ( e.g. , bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "before the cosmological constant became fashionable , a value of @xmath97178 was used for the flat einstein de sitter universe .    using equations  [ sermass ] and [ psmass ] for the mass profile",
    ", one can ( numerically ) solve the following expression to obtain the virial radius in units of the scale radius @xmath29 and @xmath11 from the einasto and prugniel - simien model , respectively .",
    "@xmath105 halos do of course extend beyond @xmath12 ( e.g. , macci , murante , & bonometto 2003 ; prada et al .",
    "the results are shown in the top panels of figure  [ conc ] , where one can see how the virial radius is monotonically related to the density contrast between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "as @xmath12 increases beyond the effective radius , the incomplete gamma function in the mass profiles starts to asymptote to a constant value and the slope in the figures tends to 1/3 .        from the relations connecting @xmath29 and @xmath11 with @xmath13 ( equations  [ serr2 ] and [ psr2 ] ) , one can obtain the virial radius in units of @xmath13 .",
    "this is shown in the middle panels of figure  [ conc ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath108 is referred to by modelers as the _ concentration parameter_. it does not refer to the curvature or shape of the profiles , as observers might initially think , but is a measure of the density contrast of the halo relative to the average background density of the universe or @xmath109 . ] . obviously ,",
    "if one did not wish to use the virial radius ( see macci , murante , & bonometto 2003 for an alternative prescription ) , then a similar ` concentration parameter ' can be defined in terms of @xmath110 .",
    "the slope at @xmath111 is shown in the lower panels of figure  [ conc ] as a function of @xmath110 .",
    "if one thinks of dark matter halos as icebergs , which can be lowered and raised relative to the background density of the universe , then profile universality means that one can use the offset between @xmath107 and either @xmath112 or @xmath109 or @xmath43 as a measure of ` concentration ' .",
    "but if a range of profile shapes exists , i.e.  different @xmath14 ( @xmath113 in the notation of navarro et al .  2004 ) , the difference between @xmath112 and @xmath109 and @xmath43 will depend on the profile shape .",
    "what this means is that the concentration one measures will depend on where one samples the halo s density .",
    "this is important because the halo density is thought to reflect the mean density of the universe when the halo formed , and is thus a measure of the collapse redshift of the halo .",
    "it would be of value to explore whether or not the use of @xmath28 and @xmath114 ( and @xmath115 in the case of the prugniel - simien model ) , rather than @xmath109 and @xmath116 may account for some of the scatter in diagrams plotting concentration versus halo mass , or equivalently , scale radius versus scale density .",
    "finally , we note that the use of a petrosian - style radius ( petrosian 1976 ; graham et al .",
    "2005 ) , such that the mean density inside of some radius divided by the density at that radius equals some constant value , is not suitable in the case of structural homology .",
    "this is because such a radius will be equal to the same fractional number of scale radii ( @xmath29 or @xmath13 ) for every halo .",
    "that is , a petrosian - like radius will just be a re - expression of the scale radius .",
    "there has been recent interest in the the pseudo phase - space density profiles represented by @xmath118 .",
    "this quantity appears to be well approximated by a power - law @xmath119 , with @xmath120 ( taylor & navarro 2001 ; ascasibar et al.2004 ; rasia , tormen , & moscardini 2004 ; sota et al .",

    "isotropy in velocity space has been assumed .",

    "de blok ( 2005 ) has argued that the inner profile slopes of simulated , dark matter halos are inconsistent with observations of dark matter dominated galaxies ( moore et al .",

    "this is important because it suggests a possible problem with hierarchical @xmath143cdm simulations of dark matter halos , which , at least from ( 1 , 3 , @xmath19 ) model fits , typically have inner slopes steeper than @xmath16 .",
    "while there is presently no consensus as to why such a disagreement exists , some of the apparent discrepancy may arise from either baryonic processes which modify the dark matter profile ( e.g. , mashchenko , couchman , & wadsley 2006 ) , or from systematic biases in measuring inner slopes from hi and h@xmath113 long - slit observations ( van den bosch et al .",

    "<S> we have recently shown that both the prugniel - simien model and srsic s function ( hereafter referred to as the einasto model when applied to internal density profiles ) describe simulated dark matter halos better than an nfw - like model with equal number of parameters . here </S>",
    "<S> we provide analytical expressions for the logarithmic slopes of these models , and compare them with data from real galaxies . depending on the einasto parameters of the dark matter halo </S>",
    "<S> , one can expect an extrapolated , inner ( 0.011 kpc ) , logarithmic profile slope ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , with a typical value at 0.1 kpc around @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> application of this ( better fitting ) model therefore alleviates some of the past disagreement with observations on this issue . </S>",
    "<S> we additionally provide useful expressions for the concentration and assorted scale radii : @xmath3 , and @xmath4  the radius where the circular velocity profile has its maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the circular velocity profiles and the radial behavior of @xmath5 for both the einasto and prugniel - simien models , where @xmath6 is the velocity dispersion associated with the density profile @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we find this representation of the phase - space density profile to be well approximated by a power - law with slope slightly shallower than @xmath8 near @xmath9 . </S>"
