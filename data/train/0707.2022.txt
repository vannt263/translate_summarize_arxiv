    "the run ii d detector consists of the following main elements @xcite : central tracker , calorimeter and muon detector .",
    "the central tracker consists of a silicon microstrip tracker ( smt ) and a central fiber tracker ( cft ) which are both located within 2 t superconducting solenoid magnet .",
    "the smt was designed to optimize tracking and vertexing within @xmath5 .",
    "the system has a six barrel longitudinal structure interspersed with 16 radial disks .",
    "the cft has eight coaxial barrels , each supporting two dublets of overlapping scintillator fibers .",
    "one doublet serves as axial and the other , alternating by @xmath6 , serves as a stereo .",
    "the sampling calorimeter , made of uranium with liquid argon as active media , has a central section ( cc ) covering @xmath7 and two end caps ( ec ) covering @xmath8 .",
    "the calorimeter is surrounded by the muon system consisting of three layers of scintillators and drift tubes with one layer inside 1.8 t toroid and two layers outside .",
    "muon identification at @xmath9 relies on proportional drift tubes while tracking at @xmath10 relies on mini - drift tubes .",
    "luminosity is measured using plastic scintillator arrays located in front of the ec cryostats covering @xmath11 .",
    "the trigger system at d has three levels which reduce 1.7 mhz rate of inelastic collisions to 50 hz that is written to tape .",
