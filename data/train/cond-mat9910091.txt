    "studies of evolution of various systems under the influence of external stochastic forces constitute content of a large section of statistical physics .",
    "it has a great variety of applications in physics , chemistry , biology , economy and sociology , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the most known problem is the description of brownian motion . in classical formulation",
    "the brownian motion manifests itself as unceasing chaotic motion of small macroscopic particles in a liquid or a gas .",
    "the brownian motion is explained by the presence of unbalanced `` pushes '' of surrounding atoms and , hence , reveals atomic structure of continuous medium , in which the motion occurs .",
    "the achievements of probability theory serve as a mathematical basis of the kinetic theory of the brownian motion .",
    "they are as follows :    \\(i ) the central limit theorem , which justifies gaussianity of stochastic force acting on brownian particle ;    \\(ii ) the theory of markovian stochastic processes ; an important assumption used at the kinetic description of the brownian motion is that the behavior of particle at a given instant depends only on instantaneous values of physical parameters , but not on their previous history ;    \\(iii ) studies of stochastic gaussian processes , first of all , the work of bachelier ( 1900 ) , who was the first to study a continuous stochastic gaussian process with independent increments , and the work of wiener ( 1927 ) , who has given a rigorous mathematical formulation of this process and has studied properties of its sample paths .",
    "the basic equations of the kinetic theory of brownian motion are the fokker - planck equation for the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath0 in the phase space of coordinates and velocities , and the einstein - smoluchowski equation for the pdf @xmath1 in the real space .",
    "the relaxation in the phase space can occur in two steps : the first one , `` fast '' stage , at which the relaxation over velocities occurs , and maxwellian pdf is established , and the second one , `` slow '' diffusion stage , at which relaxation in the real ( coordinate ) space occurs .",
    "if in the system considered the physical conditions are such that the two stages of relaxation can be separated , then it is possible to pass from the fokker - planck equation to the einstein - smoluchowski equation and describe the system on the diffusion stage with a simpler equation . in more detail",
    "the transition to the diffusion stage is discussed in the article by chandrasekhar @xcite , which contains a brilliant presentation of classical theory of the brownian motion , as well as in the monograph @xcite containing a modern presentation of the theory of the brownian motion with inclusion of the motion in nonlinear open systems .",
    "beginning from the second half of 80-th the term `` levy motion '' is becoming widely used in statistical physics , in particular , in problems of anomalous diffusion , when characteristic displacement of diffusive particle grows as @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( the case @xmath4 corresponds to the classical brownian motion ) .",
    "levy anomalous diffusion appears in different areas of physics , namely , turbulence @xcite , solid and amorphous states physics @xcite , chaotic dynamics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite etc .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention also non - physical areas , e. g. , biology and physiology @xcite , and the theory of finance @xcite .",
    "the levy motion can be considered as a generalization of the brownian motion .",
    "indeed , the mathematical foundation of the generalization are remarkable properties of stable probability laws , whose theory has begun from the works of levy and khintchine @xcite . from the limit theorems point of view",
    "the stable probability laws are the generalization of widely used gaussian law .",
    "namely , stable laws are the limit ones for the probability laws of ( properly normalized ) sums of independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables @xcite .",
    "therefore , these laws ( as the gaussian one ) occur , when evolution of a physical system or the result of an experiment are determined by the sum of a large number of identical independent random factors . an important distinction of stable pdfs is the power law tail decreasing as @xmath5 @xmath6 is the levy index , @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the pdf moments of the order @xmath11 diverge .",
    "the above mentioned properties of stable pdfs allow one to get a simple intuitive basis for anomalous diffusion in the framework of the model of independent random `` jumps '' @xcite . however , in order to construct a consistent theory of the levy motion it is necessary to get the kinetic equations , which generalize those of the brownian motion , namely , the fokker - planck and the einstein - smoluchowski equations .",
    "it is clear also from the very simple arguments that these equations must contain space and/or time fractional derivatives . during last two decades",
    "a few monographs solely devoted to the theory of fractional calculus were appeared , see , e. g. , @xcite , and an extensive treatment of fractional order differential equations applied to heat and mass transfer were given @xcite .",
    "different forms of diffusion - like equations with fractional derivatives were proposed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these equations were applied , in particular , for the description of anomalous diffusion on random fractals @xcite , @xcite , and in chaotic hamiltonian systems , for which the orders of space and time fractional derivatives are determined by delicate properties of the phase space @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we also refer to the paper @xcite , where the general description of the fractional relaxation - oscillation and fractional diffusion - wave phenomena was provided with adoption a mathematical approach to the fractional calculus that is as simple as possible .    our paper deals with fractional generalizations of the classical fokker - planck and einstein - smoluchowski equations describing relaxation in the phase and real spaces , respectively .",
    "we follow classical approach @xcite , which is used to derive kinetic equations for the brownian motion as well as an approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , as far as we know , the fractional kinetic equation for the phase space pdf was proposed for the first time . through the paper we restrict ourselves by a one - dimensional coordinate space and two - dimensional ( coordinate plus velocity ) phase space .",
    "the generalization on two - and three - dimensional real space cases are discussed at the end of the article . besides , we restrict ourselves by symmetric fractional kinetic equations , that is , those , which include symmetric fractional derivatives ( see below ) .",
    "thus , in our paper we , at first , derive kinetic equations with symmetric fractional derivatives , which generalize fokker - planck and einstein - smoluchowski equations to the case of the levy motion .",
    "these equations are called fractional symmetric fokker - planck equation ( fsfpe ) and fractional symmetric einstein - smoluchowski equation ( fsese ) , respectively .",
    "secondly , we use these equations for studying classical problems of linear relaxation , namely , relaxation in a force - free case and relaxation of a linear levy oscillator .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the force - free relaxation in a spatially homogeneous case as well as relaxation of a linear oscillator were first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "the equations for characteristic functions were obtained by solving corresponding langevin equations with subsequent averaging the liouville equation for the phase space density . besides , with the help of fractional kinetic equation for the diffusion stage of relaxation the linear oscillator was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . with the help of fsfpe and fsese we study in detail both `` fast '' and",
    "`` slow '' stages of a linear relaxation and demonstrate a transition from the first level of description ( the use of fsfpe ) to the second one ( the use of fsese ) .",
    "further , we point attention on a description of two limit cases for the oscillator , namely , overdamped oscillator and a weakly damped oscillator .",
    "both cases are very important when studying the levy motion in nonlinear open systems .",
    "we propose a new kinetic equation for the weakly damped linear oscillator and study its solutions .",
    "we also solve numerically the langevin equations , which correspond to fractional kinetic equations .",
    "we demonstrate numerical results for the linear relaxation problems which are solved analytically , and show a good agreement between the results of kinetic theory and the results of numerical modelling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we derive fractional generalizations of the fokker - planck and the einstein - smoluchowski equations following the approaches of @xcite , @xcite . in sec .",
    "3 we investigate relaxation in a real space for the force - free levy motion and for the levy linear oscillator . in sec . 4",
    "we investigate both relaxation problems in the phase space . in sec .",
    "5 we consider relaxation for the limit cases of the levy oscillator , namely , overdamped and weakly damped oscillators .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "it is known that usually the derivation of the fokker - planck equation is based on the assumption of the finiteness of the second moment of the pdf . since this assumption breaks down for the stable pdfs",
    ", we find that the classical approach used by chandrasekhar @xcite can be adopted for the derivation without using the finiteness of the second moment .",
    "a similar treatment was undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite was adopted for the purpose of getting kinetic equation in coordinate space .",
    "like in the brownian motion theory , the initial equations in our approach are as follows :    \\1 ) integral equation for the pdf @xmath0 of the markovian stochastic process in the phase space : @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14is the transition probability , that is , the probability for coordinate @xmath15 to get increment @xmath16and for the velocity @xmath17 the increment @xmath18 during the interval @xmath19 as well ;    \\2 ) the langevin equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the friction coefficient , which is assumed to be independent of @xmath17 , @xmath22 is the regular external force , and @xmath23 is the fluctuation component of the external force .",
    "further in the theory of brownian motion , by following traditional assumptions @xcite , one gets expressions for the increments of coordinate and velocity during time interval @xmath24 , which is longer than characteristic time intervals of @xmath23 , though being shorter than time intervals during which physical parameters change appreciably : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a non - stationary stochastic process , which is assumed to be homogeneous gaussian process with independent increments possessing pdf @xmath27 the central limit theorem serves as a mathematical justification of this assumption . in accordance with",
    "stated above , we make a generalization of chandrasekhar s approach with the help of generalization of the central limit theorem to the case of i.i.d .",
    "variables having infinite variances .",
    "indeed , levy and khintchine @xcite discovered a class of stable probability laws .",
    "they are limit ones for the probability laws of normalized sums of i.i.d . random variables . each stable law with a characteristic levy index ( 0 @xmath28 @xmath8 2 ) possesses finite moments of orders @xmath29 , 0 @xmath8 @xmath29 @xmath28 , but infinite moments for higher orders .",
    "the gaussian law is also stable one with a characteristic index @xmath6= 2 , and it possesses moments of all orders . returning to eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) we note that in the theory of stochastic processes the corresponding generalization of homogeneous gaussian process @xmath30 with independent increments are the levy stable processes @xmath31 , having the characteristic function ( we restrict ourselves by symmetric stable laws ) @xcite @xmath32 where d @xmath33 0 , @xmath34 is called the scale parameter . at @xmath35=",
    "2 one has gaussian process @xmath30 . above statements justifies expediency of generalization @xmath36 in eqs .",

    "we get @xmath41 @xmath42 \\quad .",
    "\\tag{2.8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we turn to the physical space by making an inverse fourier transform over velocity in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "we treat each term in the square brackets separately .",
    "the first and the second terms , being `` classical '' ones , are transformed trivially , leading to @xmath43    and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "we turn to the last term , which can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the characteristic function ,",
    "@xmath47    we use the symmetric fractional derivative of any order @xmath48 , which may be defined , for a `` sufficiently well - behaved '' function @xmath49 as the ( pseudo - differential ) operator characterized in its fourier representation by @xmath50 here at the left - hand side we adopt the notation introduced in ref .",

    "the derivatives ( 2.12 ) - ( 2.14 ) are characterized in their fourier representation by @xmath57 where @xmath58 thus , the symmetric space - fractional derivative ( 2.11 ) can be written as @xmath59 \\quad ,   \\tag{2.16}\\ ] ] where @xmath60    now we are able to return to eq . ( 2.8 ) and write the kinetic equation for the pdf @xmath0 in the phase space as    @xmath61    where the last term is defined through eqs .",
    "( 2.11 ) - ( 2.16 ) .",
    "this is a fractional fokker - planck equation for the levy motion . at @xmath62",
    "this is an ordinary fokker - planck equation for the brownian motion .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) becomes meaningless when @xmath6 is an odd integer number .",
    "that is why , for our range of interest @xmath63 , the particular case @xmath64 must be treated separately . however ,",
    "if one uses the fourier transform over velocity when solving a particular problem , this case is not singled out .",
    "at the brownian motion description , along with the relaxation parameter @xmath65 , another relaxation parameter exists , which characterizes diffusion in a real space .",
    "if characteristic time of this process is much greater than @xmath66 , then it is possible to pass from the fokker - planck equation for the pdf @xmath0 to the einstein - smoluchowski equation for a simpler pdf @xmath1 .",
    "as in previous sub - section , at the derivation of the fractional symmetric einstein - smoluchowski equation we follow the reasonings used in the theory of brownian motion .    instead of eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) , an integral equation in a coordinate space serves as an initial one ,    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the transition probability , that is , the probability for coordinate x to get increment @xmath69 during interval @xmath24 .    in the kinetic theory of the brownian motion",
    "the transition to the einstein - smoluchowski equation corresponds to neglecting the term @xmath70 in the langevin equation ( 2.2 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , instead of two equations ( 2.2 ) we have a single langevin equation , @xmath71 and , instead of eqs .",
    "( 2.3 ) we get @xmath72 where @xmath31 is a stable process with symmetric pdf and characteristic function ( 2.5 ) , as before .",

    "we get fractional symmetric einstein - smoluchowsky equation , @xmath76 in the next sections we give examples of relaxation processes governed by eqs .",
    "( 2.22 ) and ( 2.17 ) .",
    "in this section we consider two simple examples of relaxation processes governed by fsese , namely , relaxation in a force - free case and relaxation of levy linear oscillator .",
    "setting @xmath77 in eq . ( 2.22 ) , we seek for the solution of equation    @xmath78    with an initial condition    @xmath79    we pass from eqs .",
    "( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) to the equation for the characteristic function @xmath80    @xmath81    with an initial condition    @xmath82    the solution of eqs . ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.4 ) is    @xmath83    thus , in the force - free case the random process @xmath84 is a non - stationary levy stable process with independent increments and with the scale parameter @xmath85    in the real space the levy stable pdfs are expressed in terms of fox @xmath86 functions @xcite .",
    "such representation of all stable pdfs was achieved in ref .",
    "mathematical details on @xmath86 functions are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , in present paper we do not touch a real space representation for an arbitrary @xmath87    since for the stable pdfs the variance and higher moments of integer order diverge , as statistical means characterizing the properties of these processes the moments of fractional orders can be used @xcite , @xcite . in order to guarantee the reality ,",
    "they must be defined for the modulus of stochastic variable .",
    "therefore , in case of force - free relaxation the moments of fractional orders are    @xmath88    for @xmath89 whereas @xmath90 for @xmath62 and an arbitrary @xmath29 , where @xmath91 the coefficient @xmath92 can be evaluated with the use of generalized function theory @xcite : @xmath93    equations ( 3.6 ) - ( 3.8 ) have a direct physical consequence for description of an anomalous diffusion .",
    "indeed , for the ordinary brownian motion the characteristic displacement of a particle may be written through the second moment as @xmath94 one may note from eqs . ( 3.7 ) , ( 3.8 ) , that for the normal diffusion    @xmath95    at any @xmath29 and , thus any order of the moment can serve as a measure of a normal diffusion rate :    @xmath96    if one is interested in time - dependence of the characteristic displacement , but not in the value of the prefactor .",
    "we remind that usually just the time - dependence , but not the prefactor , serves as an indicator of normal or anomalous diffusion @xcite . in analogy with eq .",
    "( 3.11 ) it follows from eqs .",
    "( 3.6 ) , ( 3.8 ) that the quantity @xmath97 at 0 @xmath28 @xmath8 2 and any @xmath29 @xmath28 can serve as a measure of an anomalous diffusion rate :    @xmath98    here we have the case of a fast anomalous diffusion , or superdiffusion .    in order to illustrate",
    "how @xmath92 influences absolute value of characteristic displacement @xmath99 , in fig.1 we show the @xmath29 - th order root of @xmath92 as a function of @xmath29 at different values of @xmath100 it is seen that @xmath101 weakly depends on @xmath29 and is near to 1 , if one does not choose @xmath29 close to @xmath87 this is especially clearly seen for @xmath102 this figure illustrates that the value of prefactor , at sufficiently small @xmath29 , practically does not influence the anomalous diffusion rate .",
    "it is expedient to give two remarks on the above .    the first one is related to applicability of the diffusion - like equation ( 3.1 ) at the levy indexes less than unity .",
    "indeed , at @xmath103 the characteristic displacement ( 3.12 ) grows faster than in the ballistic regime , that is , in case of a free particle motion with a finite velocity .",
    "this property is often proclaimed as unphysical , and the conclusion follows about inapplicability of the diffusion - like equation ( 3.1 ) at @xmath104 see , e. g. , @xcite . however , as a counterargument , one could mention the law of relative diffusion ( sometimes called as richardson law ) in the field of locally isotropic turbulence , according to which the square of displacement grows as @xmath105 , that is , faster than in the ballistic regime .",
    "the second remark is related to the divergence of the second moment @xmath106 for the hyperdiffusion . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to extract the scaling form for the second moment , the `` walker '' is enclosed in an `` imaginary growing box '' .",
    "this formal procedure leads to the diffusion scaling @xmath107 for the variance , which is consistent with eq . ( 3.12 ) , and it was implemented numerically .",
    "however , it seems that more physically relevant procedure must take into account the finite velocity of a diffusive particle .",
    "this problem is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "we only mention a recent extensive discussion on this interesting and important theme @xcite .",
    "the results of numerical simulation of the langevin equation ( 2.19 ) are shown in figs . 2 and 3 . here and below the stochastic source @xmath23",
    "is represented in numerical simulation as a discrete approximation of a `` white levy noise '' , that is , as a stationary consequence of independent identically distributed variables having symmetric stable pdf with the levy index @xmath6 and the scale parameter equal 1 . to obtain the sequence we use the generator , which is based on the method of inversion @xcite along with the gnedenko limit theorem @xcite .",
    "this generator was described in our recent papers @xcite , @xcite in more detail .",
    "time interval between the terms of the sequence is equal unity . in a force - free problem",
    "we estimate numerically the moments @xmath108 by averaging over realizations of @xmath109 the total number of realization is equal 500 , each of length 512 .    in fig .",

    "is well fitted by straight line whose slope allows one to define the diffusion exponent . at @xmath11 theoretical value of the moment is infinite , and in numerical simulation the moment strongly fluctuates , thus it is unable to get the diffusion exponent .    in fig .",
