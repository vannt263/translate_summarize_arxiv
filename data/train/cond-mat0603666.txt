    "when a liquid is quenched below its glass transition temperature , its dynamics slows down enormously and the structural relaxation time becomes bigger than the experimental time : an amorphous solid is formed . in structural glasses , in contrast to spin glasses where theoretical approaches have been developed @xcite , no theory is yet available to describe the slowing down of states beyond the glass transition , _",

    "mode coupling theory ( mct ) anticipated this scenario@xcite , and correctly describes the liquid states close to both glass transitions , where the structural slowing down sets in @xcite .",

    "quenching from high temperatures , the slowing down of the dynamics was studied by means of a two - time density correlation function , @xmath0 , where the earlier of the two times , @xmath1 , represents a ` waiting time ' after the quench .",
    "they found a scaling of the structural relaxation ( similar to the time ",
    "temperature scaling in fluid states ) with the relaxation time following a power law with @xmath1 .",
    "more recent studies within the nonergodic region have focused on dynamical heterogeneities and their importance to the glass transition @xcite .",
    "recent simulations of the attraction driven glass have considered systems where structural arrest interplays with liquid - gas separation , producing states of arrested phase separation @xcite .",
    "the observed phenomena from simulations resemble the experimental observations @xcite , but the dynamics of the system was not analyzed in terms of glass aging . in this paper",
    "we isolate the effects of the attractive glass transition from those of phase separation , and study the resulting aging dynamics without this additional complication .",
    "one paper has addressed the attractive glass by studying a system at high concentrations , above the onset of the single - phase liquid @xcite .",
    "starting from the fluid pocket between the attractive and repulsive glasses , the repulsive glass could be reached by increasing the temperature , and the attractive glass by decreasing it .",
    "however , the states studied are close to the higher order singularity mentioned above ; this affects the dynamics near the glass transition @xcite , and possibly also its aging within the non - ergodic regions .",
    "a different work by the same group @xcite studied the transition from repulsive glass to attractive glass at high density , and it was concluded that the bonds were not strong enough stabilize the attractive glass and the glass to glass transition was not observed . introducing an artificial barrier to stabilize these bonds , arrested dynamics due to the attractive glass was finally obtained and the glass to glass transition observed @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study a system which we have used previously to analyze the fluid close to the attraction driven glass transition @xcite . the liquid - gas transition has been inhibited by introducing a long - range repulsive barrier in the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "we study the aging of the system in two different states , on an isochore where we have previously determined the transition point . on performing an instantaneous quench from the system without attraction , the structure and dynamics of the system are monitored . as bonds between particles",
    "form , the local density increases , causing holes to open up elsewhere in the system . accordingly",
    ", structural relaxation takes longer and longer as aging proceeds .",
    "we show below that the attractive glass is broadly similar to the repulsive one ( and thus to atomic glasses ) in many fundamental properties , such as the time - scaling of correlation functions and the evolution of the localization length .",
    "an important difference is also noticed between the two states studied here : the glass close to the transition is `` softer '' than that deeper in the non - ergodic region , where the dynamics indeed arrests .",
    "the bond correlation function shows that the bonds are reversible even for the strongest attraction studied .",
    "the bond and density correlation functions evolve differently , in contradiction with recent results found in a different system at high temperatures and by a different simulation method @xcite .",
    "finally , we turn off the repulsive barrier and study the competition between the attractive glass transition and liquid - gas separation , to elucidate the role of the barrier in the dynamics . this investigation is motivated in part by recent observations of equilibrium clusters in protein solutions at lower packing fractions where a charge induced repulsive barrier is considered essential @xcite .",
    "the results show that the dynamics of the system is similar with and without the barrier .",
    "this suggests that the aging dynamics is primarily controlled by bond formation in a state of arrested phase separation , rather than slow evolution of the long - wavelength density fluctuations that are present in such a state .",

    "upon increasing the attraction strength at constant colloid density ( @xmath40 ) the attractive glass transition is found at @xmath51 , as estimated from the analysis of the density correlation functions , self - diffusion coefficients and viscosity according to mct @xcite .    as stated above , we study the aging dynamics for two states quenched to within the non - ergodic region , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "the structure and dynamics is tackled for both quenches and compared with an ergodic fluid close to the transition , namely @xmath54 .",
    "some theoretical predictions are also tested .",
    "the effect of the repulsive barrier is studied in the final subsection .      the instantaneous quench from @xmath39",
    "provokes the formation of bonds between particles .",
    "since both states are above the percolation line in density , a bonded cluster extending throughout the system is formed at zero time ( using the interaction range , @xmath55 , to define the length of a bond ) .    in fig .",
    "[ energy ] the evolution of the mean number of neighbors ( bonds ) per particle , and of the energy per particle , are presented for both quenches . as the bonds between particles form , the energy per particle decreases .",
    "this process slows down as the waiting time increases , but a steady state is not reached in the simulation .",
    "interestingly , more bonds are formed in the quench to the lower @xmath14 , although the energy per bond is smaller in this case . however , the equilibrium system at @xmath54 reaches a larger number of bonds per particle ( horizontal blue line in the upper right corner of the figure ) , at least in the time studied in the simulation .",
    "note that , in comparison with repulsion driven glasses ( with broadly similar potential minima ) @xcite , the energy evolves much more in the attractive case .",
    "this can be expected given the relatively low density ( @xmath40 ) of our system .",
    "recall that , at @xmath39 no bonds are present in the system ; but as soon as the quench is performed a highly bonded state exists .",
    "this state evolves with time , and can alter considerably since particles are not strongly caged by their hard - core repulsions at this modest @xmath56 .",
    "this leaves much more room for energy drift in attractive glasses than in the repulsion - driven case .",
    "the intricate structure of the network can induce a heterogeneous distribution of the bonds per particle . in fig .",
    "[ nneigh - dist ] the evolution of the distribution of bonds per particle is presented for both states at different waiting times and compared with the distribution for the equilibrium system at @xmath54 .",
    "all of the distributions ( including that of the system in equilibrium ) are wide , due to the heterogeneity of the system , but single - peaked . as aging proceeds , the distribution moves to higher numbers of neighbors per particle causing an increase in the mean number , but never reaches the distribution at equilibrium .",
    "thus , the difference in the mean number of neighbors shown in fig . [ energy ] is caused by a displacement of the distribution towards larger number of neighbors , and not by the development of stronger heterogeneities in the structure of the system .",
    "the structure factor of the system is presented in fig .",
    "[ sq ] , for both quenches , at different waiting times . increased local order is noticed in the main peak in @xmath57 ; this slightly increases with waiting time , and the oscillations at high-@xmath58 become stronger .",
    "but the most prominent feature in the evolution of @xmath57 is the appearance of a low-@xmath58 peak , which grows and moves to smaller wavevectors with waiting time ( see insets ) .",
    "since the system has bond percolation from the outset , this peak is associated not with cluster formation , but with voids appearing and growing ( thus the peak moves to smaller @xmath58 ) as the bonding state evolves .",
    "accordingly , the structure factor for the homogeneous system at @xmath39 shows no peak in this region , and the neighbor peak is displaced to larger wavevectors in both quenches ( particles come closer to each other ) .    in agreement with fig .",
    "[ energy ] , the fluid system at @xmath54 shows a higher neighbor peak and stronger oscillations , since there are more bonds in the equilibrium state than in the quenches ( the difference being larger for @xmath49 ) . also , the low-@xmath58 peak is highest in the equilibrium state ( on the time scales studied in the simulation ) , and higher for lower @xmath14 in the non - ergodic region .",
    "the overall trend is consistent with slow restructuring of the system to reach a lower energy ; for stronger bonds the system is more hindered on its way towards the energy minimum ( even though this is deeper in principle ) .",
    "this hindrance is characteristic of aging systems , although in attractive glasses it is caused by bonding , as opposed to core - core repulsions in repulsive glasses .",
    "the low wavevector peak in @xmath57 resembles a low angle peak found in experiments on colloidal gelation and aggregation @xcite .",
    "the origin of the experimental peak has not fully been determined ; since gelation inhibits liquid - gas separation , the peak is probably the signature of frustrated demixing @xcite .",
    "it also obeys the factorization rule typical of spinodal decomposition @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the low @xmath58 peak is not caused by an arrested phase separation , but it is an intrinsic characteristic of the system induced by the long range repulsive barrier in the interaction .",
    "it is a signature of the trend to microphase separation .",
    "therefore , it will stop growing and moving to smaller @xmath58 since the system does not demix .",
    "its behavior is thus similar to the experimental one but not of the same origin .",
    "we show below that the dynamics of the system is independent of the origin of this peak in our simulations .",
    "the stiffness of the system with increasing attraction strength discussed above is apparent also in its dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ msd ] the mean squared displacement is presented for different waiting times , as a function of @xmath41 , for both quenches . as time proceeds , the system is more solid - like , and the displacements of particles is hindered . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath59 for the equilibrium system at @xmath54 is also presented . at @xmath49 , even for short waiting times , the dynamics of the out - of - equilibrium systems is slower than the fluid one , although the mean number of bonds per particle is significantly smaller ( see figs . [ energy ] and [ nneigh - dist ] ) .",
    "the comparison between both quenches shows that the system at @xmath49 slows down much faster than at @xmath48 . at large waiting times , the former shows a clear plateau in @xmath59 at @xmath60 , which extends for three decades in time . on the other hand",
    ", the state at @xmath48 only shows a hint of the plateau , which is located at longer distances , and the mean squared displacement reaches larger values .    the self part of the intermediate scattering function , or incoherent density correlation function , shows similar features as the mean squared displacement : a progressive development of a plateau , clearer and higher for @xmath49 than for @xmath48 . in fig .",

    "the scaling can be significantly improved if only the data with not - too - small waiting times are used , as shown below ( fig .",
    "[ scaling - nobarrier ] ) .",
    "as expected , the plateau in the correlation function is clearer ( flatter ) in the case of @xmath49 , whereas no real plateau is seen at @xmath48 . when compared to @xmath39 ( broken thin line ) , more than five decades in time of slowing down are observed .",
    "it is also noticeable that the shape of the relaxation curve changes with the attraction strength ; it is more stretched in the equilibrium system ( @xmath54 , continuous thin line ) than in the aging states .",
    "we interpret these findings as arrested dynamics induced by particle bonding , indicated by the existence of a plateau in @xmath62 for @xmath49 , even with reversible bonds that are not stabilized artificially @xcite .",

    "@xmath112 has decayed only a few percent , implying that most of the particles have been unable to escape their network of bonds .    these results for @xmath112 fully support the conclusions drawn from @xmath62 ;",

    "after the rescaling , neither @xmath62 or @xmath108 collapse , but the density correlation functions cross at @xmath113 , whereas no crossing is observed for @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , at constant @xmath115 beyond the crossing point , i.e. @xmath116 , @xmath117 is larger for longer waiting times , whereas @xmath114 is smaller . in other words ,",
    "the time scale for the slowing down of structural relaxation grows faster than the ` bond life time ' .",
    "( note that a unique bond life time can not be defined , however , because the decays of the bond correlation functions do not collapse for different waiting times . )",

    "similar results are obtained for @xmath49 ( data not shown ) , both in the decoupling of the time scale for structural relaxation and bond life time , and in the suggested simple aging regime for long waiting times .      in order to test the effect of the repulsive barrier in the interaction potential , introduced to prevent phase separation but possibly inducing microphase separation ,",
    "we have performed simulations without the barrier .",
    "the system , thus , is closer to the experimental colloid - polymer mixtures where gels have been deeply studied @xcite . in previous simulation works",
    ", it was shown that the liquid - gas separation is arrested by the attraction driven glass transition , in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "we show below that indeed this is the case in our system and we analyze the effect of the repulsive barrier on the dynamics of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ sq - nobarrier ] we show the evolution of the structure following the quench .",
    "the structure factor develops a low - q peak which moves to lower wavevector and grows , but apparently saturates during the simulation time  for comparison , in the system with @xmath119 below the glass point @xmath81 the low - q peak moves out below the accessible wavevectors , for @xmath120 .",
    "the structure factors of states with and without the repulsive barrier are compared for the same waiting time in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ sq - nobarrier ] .",
    "the peak is placed at lower wavevectors and is higher for the system without barrier .",
    "these results indicate that the phase separation is prevented by the glass transition , resulting in a heterogeneous system with voids and dense regions .",
    "the effect of the repulsive barrier in the potential is then to reduce the size and concentration of voids .",
    "an analysis similar to that of sec .",
    "iii.b can be conducted to study the dynamics of the arrested system .",
    "the mean squared displacement and density correlation function show a slowing down of the dynamics as the waiting time increases , in a two - step process , similar to glass aging .",
    "the density correlation functions can be rescaled to overlap the decay from the plateau as shown in fig .",
    "[ scaling - nobarrier ] for @xmath49 without barrier , where only waiting times above @xmath121 are included . for comparison ,",
    "the master function for @xmath49 and @xmath48 with the repulsive barrier are also included .",
    "note that the scaling of the curves is much better than in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] since only data with @xmath122 is used .",
    "the two master functions for @xmath49 are very similar over the whole decay from the plateau , indicating that the long time relaxation of the system is only slightly affected by the repulsive barrier .",
    "the time scale of this relaxation as a function of the waiting time ( not shown ) also obeys a power law , with exponent larger than one : @xmath123 , very close to the exponent found in the system with barrier , @xmath124 .",
    "the non - ergodicity parameters for the incoherent correlation function are presented in the inset of fig .",
    "[ scaling - nobarrier ] for the same states .",
    "the agreement between the two @xmath72 at @xmath49 indicates that the localization length is similar in both cases , and that the origin of the transition is the same : bond formation .",
    "[ bonds - nobarrier ] presents the evolution of the bond correlation function for the state @xmath49 without the repulsive barrier ( upper panel ) .",
    "this function decays even at very long waiting times , although the mean bond - life time grows continuously .",
    "the comparison of the bond correlation functions for the system with and without the barrier ( lower panel ) , shows completely similar trends , and that the bonds for the system without the barrier are slightly stronger .",
    "the results presented in this subsection indicate that the repulsive barrier plays a minor role in the behaviour of the system beyond the glass transition , although it has a tremendous effect below it suppressing the liquid - gas separation .",
    "the competition between glassy physics and phase transition results in a system with arrested phase separation , whose properties are largely similar to those of the system without the phase transition .",
    "this study also rules out the possibility that microphase separation , if it occurs in our system , is primarily responsible for the results presented above .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that aging of attraction driven glasses is broadly analogous to the aging of repulsion driven glasses , albeit with some specificities arising from the different driving mechanism in either case : bond formation for the former , steric hindrance for the latter .",
    "specific differences appear , for instance , in the values of localization length and in @xmath71 . in attraction driven systems , as in repulsive ones , the mean squared displacement and density correlation functions display a plateau followed by a decay , which moves to longer times as the waiting time grows .",
    "@xmath125 can be time - scaled to collapse during the decay from the plateau for different waiting times , and the decay time follows a power - law dependence on the waiting time , with an exponent slightly bigger than unity .",
    "the non - ergodicity parameter increases as the state is deeper in the glass , following an apparent square - root behavior , and oscillates in phase with the structure factor , decaying at larger wavevectors with increasing @xmath14 , implying a shortening localization length .",
    "the bond and environment correlation functions show that as the aging proceeds and more bonds are established , a stiffer network of particles forms whose relaxation time increases ; but that the bonds themselves are not permanent . however , whereas the time scale for structural relaxation grows faster than the waiting time , the bond life time increases slower than @xmath1 .",
    "this decoupling of structural relaxation from single bond breaking illustrates the collective character of the dynamical arrest . yet , from our simulations , it can not be ruled out that for large enough @xmath1 both time scales approach simple aging behavior , scaling directly with @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of the repulsive barrier ( introduced to suppress liquid - gas separation ) on the dynamics is quite weak beyond the glass transition ; this suggests that the transition is primarily induced by bonding , and that aging in attractive glasses is dominated by the evolution of the bonds rather than by any slow evolution of the phase separation pattern .",
    "important differences can be observed between the quenches to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the former is slightly above the transition line , and does not show clear plateaus in @xmath62 , the mean squared displacement or @xmath112 .",
    "the stretching of the correlation functions is also different ( more stretched closer to the transition point ) .",
    "nevertheless , scaling of the density correlation functions was fulfilled , and the exponent of the relaxation time as a function of the waiting time is similar for both states . from the structural point of view , the glass with lower attraction strength allows for more restructuring : the holes are bigger , as noticed by a higher low-@xmath58 peak in the structure factor , and more bonds per particle are formed .",
    "interestingly , our molecular dynamics results strongly indicate that bonds of finite energy , which are therefore reversible on the time scale of the simulation , can induce dynamical arrest at high enough interaction strength .",
    "these conclusions are different from those drawn from previous works @xcite although the results themselves are not very different from ours .",
    "the decoupling of structural relaxation from single bond breaking represents another aspect where our results differ from previous findings @xcite , if those can be extrapolated to low temperatures .",
    "the softness of the glass at low attraction strength ( close to the boundary , @xmath48 ) may arise from a non - vanishing population of highly mobile particles detected in the fluid phase close to the transition point @xcite .",
    "this population coexists with a rigid network of particles , and reduces as the attraction strength is increased , being completely absent at @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the origin of the softness can thus perhaps be traced back to the strong dynamical heterogeneities in the fluid .    finally , in addition to the results presented in this paper , we have found recently that many dynamical quantities for the fluid states close to the glass line can be accounted for within mct , not only in its universal qualitative predictions , but also quantitatively @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dynamic heterogeneities of the glass decrease as the state point moves deeper into the attractive glass @xcite , in agreement with findings for repulsive glasses @xcite .",
    "all of these results support the argument that attraction driven glasses share many universal properties with repulsion driven glasses , albeit with some differences that are attributable to the different driving mechanism .",
