    "single molecule magnets ( smm s ) have been under intense study recently , due to their potential uses in magnetic storage and quantum computing.@xcite the materials consist of insulating crystalline arrays of identical smm s 1 - 3 nm in size , each containing two or more magnetic ions .",
    "since the magnetic ions in each smm are surrounded by non - magnetic ligands , the intermolecular magnetic interactions are usually negligible .",
    "although the most commonly studied smm s are the high - spin mn@xmath20 and fe@xmath21,@xcite such smm s contain a variety of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) intramolecular interactions , rendering unique fits to a variety of experiments difficult.@xcite    in addition , there have been many studies of afm fe@xmath22 ring compounds , where @xmath23 etc.@xcite in these studies , analyses of inelastic neutron diffraction data and the magnetic induction @xmath9 dependence of the low - temperature @xmath3 specific heat and magnetization steps were made , using the isotropic heisenberg near - neighbor exchange interaction , the zeeman interaction , and various near - neighbor spin anisotropy interactions.@xcite however , the rings were so complicated that analyses of the data using those simple models were inaccessible to present day computers.@xcite thus , those authors used either simulations or phenomenological fits to a first - order perturbation expansion with different spin anisotropy values for each global ring spin value.@xcite    here we focus on the simpler cases of equal spin @xmath24 magnetic dimers , for which the full spin anisotropy effects can be evaluated analytically , investigated in detail numerically , and compared with experiment .",
