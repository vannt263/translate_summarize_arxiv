    "topological phases of matters have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years due to their novel properties such as topologically protected ground states @xcite , long - range entanglement @xcite and emergent quasiparticles ( qp ) with fractional statistics , i.e. anyons @xcite , which make them a suitable playground for topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "our understanding of a topologically ordered phases in an exactly solvable spin model began with the toric code introduced by kitaev @xcite .",
    "the ground state manifold is multiple degenerate depending on the genus of the space where the lattice is embedded , and the excitations carry abelian statistics .",
    "however , the many - body nature of the spin interactions involving four - body terms in the underlying hamiltonian makes its physical realization challenging .",
    "this problem was resolved by kitaev in his seminal work @xcite by introducing a simple nearest - neighbor spin hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "an exact solution based on majorana representation of spins exists for the model yielding the kitaev model two quantum spin liquid phases ( see fig.[fig : phasediag](a ) for a schematic representation ) with @xmath1 topological oder : a gapped phase which is continuously connected to the toric code and a gapless phase which can host non - abelian ising anyons when the majorana fermions are gapped out by adding perturbations breaking the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "although the toric model was first aimed at exotic excitations for quantum computations , recent experiments have unveiled the prospect of relevance of the kitaev interactions in the highly anisotropic magnets on honeycomb lattices such as na@xmath2iro@xmath3 , li@xmath2iro@xmath3 @xcite , and @xmath4-rucl@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "of the two - body color code .",
    "spin-1/2 particles are placed on the vertices of the lattice and the spin - spin interactions are denoted by colored links .",
    "the rectangular dashed regions further represent the clusters used for exact diagonalization . ]",
    "the discovery of such quantum magnets presaged the study of other models with anisotropic interactions on different lattices , including decorated honeycomb @xcite , triangular @xcite , spin ladder @xcite and ruby @xcite lattices .",
    "the latter one , the ruby color code ( rcc ) shown in fig.[fig : ruby ] , is central to our work in this paper .",
    "the bismuth ions in layered materials such as bi@xmath5rh@xmath3i@xmath6 form a bilayer ruby lattice @xcite with interesting topological properties .",
    "we explore the phase diagram of a spin model with kitaev interactions ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) on the ruby lattice in terms of exchange couplings ( @xmath7 ) restricted to the plane @xmath8 .",
    "anisotropic interactions can in principle arise in transition metal compounds with strong spin - orbit couplings , which make the superexchange processes to be highly anisotropic and bond dependent @xcite .",
    "when @xmath9 , the low energy spectrum of the spin model ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) is gapped and the ground state manifold is topologically ordered @xcite . the low energy sector is continuously connected to the so called topological color code ( tcc ) model first introduced by bombin _ et.al .",

    "in contrast to the kitaev model , the topological order in tcc is associated with @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "this symmetry gives rise to emergence of highly interacting fermions with semionic mutual statistics in the gapped phase  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the full phase diagram of the rcc model , which to our best knowledge has not been explored so far .",
    "we contrast the phase diagram of @xmath0 rcc with that of @xmath1 kitaev model ; see fig.[fig : phasediag](a - b ) .",
    "we used finite - size exact diagonalization ( ed ) based on lanczos algorithm on periodic clusters of different sizes to map out the full phase diagram of the rcc model from analysis of the ground state energy and its derivatives .",
    "our results show that the phase digram contains one gapped and two gapless phases .",
    "the gapped phase corresponds to tcc on the honeycomb lattice as mentioned above .",
    "the gapless phases appear at the corner of phase diagram in the regime where either @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "this allows us to use degenerate perturbation theory ( dpt ) to derive the low - energy effective theory of the underlying phases .",
    "we find that the gapless phases are described by an effective hamiltonian with three - body interactions on a triangular lattice .",
    "we argue that the latter phases could be possibly described by a rich structure of ising anyons due to the underlying @xmath12 gauge symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : two - body - tcc ] we introduce the rcc model and review some of the features of the model used in the paper .",
    "we present the phase diagram of the model in sec.[sec : phase - diag ] and characterize the underlying phases emerging in different coupling regime of the problem in sec.[sec : characterize ] .",
    "a possible description of phases in terms of ising anyons is discussed in sec.[sec : conclude ] .",
    "the rcc model @xcite is a quantum spin system defined on a certain type of four - valent graphs , i.e. the ruby lattice @xmath13 shown in fig.[fig : ruby ] .",

    ", we set @xmath22 .",
    "the rcc model supports loop structures as well as string - net integrals of motions defined by connecting certain vertices and links of the lattice , underlying a @xmath12 gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the kitaev honeycomb model @xcite , the two - body color code on the ruby lattice is not exactly solvable because of the four - valence structure ( four bonds are emanating from each site ) of the lattice as opposed to the three - valence structure of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "therefore , we resort to numerical techniques and approximation methods to map out the phase diagram of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) in different coupling regimes ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we restrict the exchange coupling to the @xmath8 .",
    "the coupling @xmath24 accounts for an overall energy scale , which we set to be unite @xmath25 throughout .",
    "we apply the exact diagonalization technique to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) to capture the possible phases and phase transitions in different coupling regimes , by analyzing the ground state energy of the system and its derivatives .",
    "our ed algorithm relies on the lanczos method on the periodic clusters with @xmath26 and @xmath27 sites shown in fig.[fig : ruby ] .",
    "matrix elements of the hamiltonian are further generated using the @xmath28 pauli vector space and bit representation .    in order to capture the phase transitions of the model",
    ", we have calculated the second derivative of the ground state energy per - site ( sde ) in the @xmath29 plane and detected the phase boundaries from the diverging behavior of the second derivatives of the energy as shown in fig.[fig : phasediag](c ) . due to the finite size lattices ,",
    "a real diverging is obscured .",
    "thus , we take the location of minimum of sde as a phase transition point . this might be a crude estimation of locating the phase transition , but we notice that on the paths in the phase diagram with possible phase transitions , e.g. the dashed red line in fig.[fig : phasediag](b ) , the behavior of sde significantly differs from those paths with no phase transition . moreover , moving from a lattice with 18 sites to a larger one with 24 sites , the minima in sde become slightly deeper providing a strong evidence of phase transition .",
    "we elaborate on details on such transitions below .    to find the phase boundary we look for the minima in sde along paths corresponding to the intersection of the plane @xmath29 with a plane at fixed @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we use @xmath32 accounting for a one - dimensional parameter space referring to the points lying on the intersection line .",
    "a few of such lines are shown as dashed lines in fig.[fig : phasediag](b ) , where we show the full phase diagram of the rcc model .",
    "we begin by setting @xmath33 , the dashed green line .",
    "the corresponding sde is plotted in fig.[fig : phasediag](c ) with the same color to make the comparison with other sde s easier .",
    "as seen , only one phase transition is signaled at ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "increasing @xmath35 further , we did nt observe other phase transitions until a multi - critical point at @xmath36 is reached , beyond which there are multiple phase transitions .",
    "we sum up this part by concluding that the region of the phase diagram with @xmath37 has two phases which we label as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the phase transition in this region occurs when @xmath40 .",
    "now we move the parameter line @xmath32 to go beyond the @xmath36 point in the phase diagram , e.g. the dashed red and blue lines in fig.[fig : phasediag](b ) .",
    "increasing @xmath41 , we observe that two distinct minima start to appear in the sde curves .",
    "for instance let us consider the behavior of sde as the parameter @xmath32 varies on the dashed red line in fig.[fig : phasediag](b ) . on this particular line @xmath42 .",
    "we observed that two minima appeared in sde .",
    "the first minimum signals a phase transition out of @xmath43 phase to another phase that we call it @xmath44 , and the second minimum signals yet another phase transition from @xmath44 phase to @xmath45 phase . for @xmath35 s in the interval @xmath46 two minima appeared in sde s , making phase boundaries between different phases marked by squares in fig.[fig : phasediag](b ) . moving beyond the @xmath47",
    ", no phase transition appears , which shows that the rcc model is in the @xmath48 phase in this part of the phase diagram .",
    "consider a parameter line @xmath32 corresponding to the dashed blue line @xmath49 on the phase diagram .",
    "the sde plot is free of any minimum leading us to a conclusion that there is no more phase transition .",
    "the analysis presented in the preceding section yields a phase diagram with three distinct phases for the rcc model ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) within ed on finite clusters . according to the phase diagram fig.[fig : phasediag](b ) , each phase emerges when one of the couplings of the hamiltonian is stronger than the two others . for example , the @xmath44 phase corresponds to the @xmath9 coupling regime with strong interaction on the blue links , while the @xmath43 ( @xmath45 ) phase emerges in the @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) coupling regime with strong interaction on the red ( green ) links .",
    "symmetry of the lattice structure further imposes that @xmath43 and @xmath45 phases to be equivalent , up to the interchange of the couplings ( @xmath52 ) and colors of the red and green links . here , we elaborate on the properties of the phases by focusing on each regime .",
    "the @xmath44 phase arises in the particular regime of the couplings where @xmath53 .",
    "this regime of the problem has already been studied in detail in ref.@xcite and it has been shown that the low - energy physics of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) in this limit is described by an effective topological color code model @xcite on the honeycomb lattice ; see fig.[fig : honey_tri](a - c ) .",
    "the low - energy description in this limit is given by a many - body hamiltonian as follows [ htcc ] h_tcc&=&-_p ( _ zz_p+_xx_p+_yy_p ) , where sum runs over hexagonal plaquettes and the plaquette operators are product of pauli matrices around a hexagon @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the coupling @xmath57 arises at 6th order of degenerate perturbation theory , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 arise at 9th order @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the model ( [ htcc ] ) is separated from the excited state by a gap . for a lattice with periodic boundary conditions defined on a torus with genus @xmath60",
    "the ground state manifold is 16-fold degenerate resulting from the @xmath12 gauge symmetry , as opposed to 4-fold degeneracy of the toric code with a @xmath1 gauge group symmetry .",
    "recently , a minimal tcc with seven qubits has been simulated in optical lattices being capable of detecting and correcting the errors @xcite .",
    "the model has been the subject of several studies and many features of the model has already been revealed , ranging from error threshold @xcite , robustness @xcite , entanglement properties @xcite and interesting quasiparticle excitations @xcite .    .",
    "these limits , in the degenerate perturbation theory , correspond to @xmath9 and @xmath10 yielding effective hamiltonians ( [ htcc ] ) and ( [ eq : low - energy - h - dpt ] ) , respectively .",

    "nature of the @xmath43 phase and low - energy physics of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) in the limit @xmath65 , to the best of our knowledge , is not a priori known .",
    "similar limit for the kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice has already been studied in ref.@xcite . as discussed above",
    ", the phase @xmath39 arises in the limit @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we need to study one of them .",
    "we argue how the ruby lattice in the isolated - dimer limit is connected to a triangular lattice , and we setup a perturbative picture in the low - energy sector of the rcc model based on degenerate perturbation theory which is applied directly to the ( @xmath67 ) limit of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) .",
    "the ruby lattice in the isolated - dimer limit is connected to a triangular lattice as shown in fig.[fig : honey_tri](d - f ) .",
    "this is best perceived by coloring the hexagons and the rectangles of the ruby lattice such that each rectangle connects two hexagons of the same color in the long direction and shares the same color with the hexagons .",
    "following such coloring rules , the resulting colored ruby lattice is illustrated in fig.[fig : honey_tri](e ) .",
    "next we replace the red links of the ruby lattice by red sites which shrink the hexagons and rectangles of the ruby lattice into _ down _ and _ up _ triangles labeled by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively ( see fig.[fig : honey_tri](g ) ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath70 denotes the color of the reduced triangles .",
    "the ruby lattice is then reduced to a triangular lattice labeled by @xmath71 ; see fig.[fig : honey_tri](f ) .",
    "next we use degenerate perturbation theory in the limit @xmath65 to derive an effective model on the triangular lattice @xmath71 . before that , let us for simplicity rotate the hamiltonian ( [ eq : two - body - tcc ] ) such that @xmath72 and then write it in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the unperturbed diagonal part and @xmath75 is the perturbation represented by h_0&=&-j_x_r - link s_i^z s_j^z , [ eq : h0 - 2body ] + v&= & -j_y_g - link s_i^y s_j^y -j_z_b - link s_i^x s_j^x , [ eq : v-2body ] where @xmath76 denotes the nearest neighbors on the bonds of the ruby lattice . in the extreme case where @xmath77 , the system is composed of isolated red dimers , where its ground state is given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 ferromagnetic states on the red links .",
    "ground state of the system is therefore @xmath80-fold degenerate ( where @xmath81 is the number of red dimers ) with ground state energy @xmath82 .",
    "excitations of the model correspond to antiferromagnetic red dimers that each cost @xmath83 i.e. the first excited state of the system is @xmath84-fold degenerate and has a total energy @xmath85 .",
    "effects of @xmath86 interactions can further be studied perturbativally , around the strong @xmath87 couplings .    as we pointed out , the red dimers of the ruby lattice are equivalent to the vertices of the effective triangular lattice @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore label each dimer by an index @xmath88 and define a projection operator on each dimer : [ eq : projector ] p_v=||+|| , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are effective spin-1/2 on the vertex @xmath88 of lattice @xmath71 .",

    "the overall low - energy effective theory of the rcc in the isolated - dimer limit is therefore given by ( [ eq : low - energy - h - dpt ] ) .",
    "unlike the tcc model , which is exactly solvable , the anti - commutation of some plaquette operators appearing in ( [ eq : low - energy - h - dpt ] ) obscures the exact solution .",

    "the same fact holds for the @xmath45 phase up to the interchange of @xmath87 and @xmath111 couplings .",
    "in this work we used numerical and perturbative methods to map out the phase diagram of the rcc model with @xmath12 gauge symmetry , and the main results are summarized in fig.[fig : phasediag](b ) .",
    "we found three distinct phases are present in the phase diagram separated from each other by three phase boundaries met at a multi - critical point : ( i ) the @xmath44 is a gapped phase arising in the strong @xmath30 coupling , whose low - energy excitations are known to have abelian statistics , and ( ii ) the @xmath43 and @xmath45 are two gapless phases arising in the regimes of couplings where either @xmath87 or @xmath111 , respectively , is the strongest one .",

    "the @xmath12 abelian gapped phase is basically two copies of the toric code model @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect the same construction can be used to identify the possible ising anyons in rcc model .",
    "the low - energy sector of the abelian phase is described by sixteen super - selection sectors @xcite : the vacuum 1 , the anyons @xmath120 , bosons @xmath121 , and the fermions @xmath122 . note that @xmath123 and @xmath124 due to @xmath12 symmetry .",

    "therefore , we conjecture that the abelian @xmath48 phase undergoes a phase transition to @xmath38 and @xmath39 phases with colored ising anyons @xmath125 . viewed the topological color code as two coupled toric code models @xcite , it suggests that the construction ( [ ising ] ) could be a spin analogue of coupled bilayer fractional quantum hall states with @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "it is shown that for latter systems the condensation of abelian anyons in the layers via a phase transition leads to rich structure for non - abelian anyons such as @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xcite . however",
