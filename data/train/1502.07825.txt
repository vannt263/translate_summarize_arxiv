    "blazars are the most violent active galactic nuclei .",
    "they are known to emit nonthermal - dominated radiation from radio frequencies to @xmath1-rays , with strong variability across the entire spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such emission likely originates from a relativistic jet that is directed close to our line of sight .",
    "the blazar spectral - energy - distribution ( sed ) has two components .",
    "it is generally acknowledged that the nonthermal radio through optical - uv emission is synchrotron radiation from ultrarelativistic electrons . in leptonic models , the high - energy component , from x - rays to @xmath1-rays ,",
    "is usually interpreted as resulting from inverse compton scattering by the same nonthermal electron population of soft seed photons .",
    "seed photons can either come from the synchrotron component itself ( synchrotron - self compton = ssc ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or from external photon fields originaiting in the broad line region and/or a dusty torus ( external compton = ec ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a hadronic origin of the high - energy component can not be ruled out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated that the high - energy polarization signatures can serve as a powerful diagnostic between the leptonic and hadronic processes .    despite intensive observational and theoretical efforts , the particle acceleration mechanism , the energy source for flaring activity , and",
    "the inner - jet physical conditions , such as the magnetic field topology , are not well understood . on the observational side ,",
    "the synchrotron component is known to be polarized , with polarization degrees ranging from a few to tens of percent , in agreement with a synchrotron origin in a partially ordered magnetic field .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the observed polarization degree and angle may reveal a helical magnetic field structure .",
    "both the polarization degree and angle are known to be highly variable .",
    "large ( @xmath2 ) polarization angle swings have been frequently observed , and some recent observations @xcite have shown that they are sometimes accompanied by simultaneous optical and @xmath1-ray flaring activities . when the polarization angle is not rotating , small fluctuations of the polarization signatures around a relatively stable mean value are often observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "time - symmetric polarization profiles are observed in both cases , in particular a complete @xmath3 polarization angle swing is often accompanied by a drop of the polarization degree to nearly zero followed by a recovery back to its value before the pa rotation ( see the above references ) .",
    "on the theory side , the general formalism for synchrotron polarization is well understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the spectrum , variability and polarization signatures have never been combined into one coherent physical model to understand the inner - jet physics .",
    "models for synchrotron polarization necessarily take into account the magnetic field topology and polarization - dependent synchrotron emissivity , but often apply simple , time - independent , power - law electron populations , and usually ignore the generation of high energy emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus they can not produce full broadband spectral - energy - distributions ( sed ) and variability . on the other hand",
    ", models presenting detailed calculations of broadband emission and variability typically assume a chaotic magnetic field , and ignore any polarization - dependent emissivity and polarization information .",
    "additionally , previous emission models hardly provide any constraints on the particle acceleration mechanisms and the energy source . in a recent paper , @xcite ( hereafter paper i )",
    "have presented a general parameter study as a first step to combine the full sed , variability and polarization signatures in a single physical model .",
    "this paper has demonstrated that polarization - angle swings , correlated with high - energy flaring activity , only require a dominant helical magnetic field structure in a straight jet , but no non - axisymmetric jet features , such as bends or helical flow streamlines .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate additional geometric effects , namely the shape of the emission region and the magnetic field topology , on the synchrotron polarization signatures and multiwavelength variability .",
    "we find that the apparently time - symmetric polarization profiles can be obtained by an axisymmetric emission region along with full consideration of the light - travel - time effects .",
    "we will then apply the results obtained here and in paper i to present the first simultaneous fitting of snapshot broadband seds , light curves in various frequency bands , and time - dependent polarization signatures , from a correlated optical and @xmath1-ray flaring event of the prominent blazar 3c279 , which was accompanied by a drastic change of its polarization features .",
    "this unprecedented fitting combination in one coherent model allows us to place stringent constraints on the particle acceleration and its energy source , as well as the magnetic field structure and its variation , in the inner jet of the blazar .",
    "our results strongly favor a scenario in which magnetic energy dissipation is the primary driver of the flare event .",
    "we will describe our model setup in section 2 , present a general study of the geometric effects in section 3 , fit the 3c279 flare event in section 4 , and discuss the results in section 5 .",
    "our setup is designed to highlight the combined geometric and light - travel - time effects with the simplest physical assumptions .",
    "the underlying model considered here assumes a cylindrical emission region which travels on a straight trajectory defined by the jet boundary and encounters a flat stationary disturbance .",
    "the entire region is pervaded by a predominantly helical magnetic field , with possibly an additional turbulent component .",
    "the origin of the disturbance could be a shock , which will convert bulk kinetic energy into random motion of relativistic particles to generate a flare ; but it may also may also be associated with other mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection , which will dissipate magnetic energy to accelerate particles ( @xcite , see section 4 ) . in the comoving frame of the emission region , the disturbance will travel through the emission region , and temporarily change the plasma conditions at its location , primarily the magnetic field structure and the nonthermal particle distribution through a modification of the acceleration time scale , and hence generate a flare . as the disturbance leaves a given point in the emission region",
    ", the plasma conditions will recover back to the initial state .",
    "most importantly , due to the light - travel - time effects ( lttes ) , the observer will receive signatures of flaring activities induced by the disturbance , from points at different longitudinal distances along the jet at the same time .",
    "owing to the axisymmetry of the emission region , this leads to time - symmetric polarization profiles ( see sections 3 and 4 )",
    ".    the above model is simulated by the combination of the two - dimensional monte - carlo / fokker - planck radiation transfer ( mcfp ) code developed by @xcite and the 3d multi - zone synchrotron polarization ray - tracing code developed by @xcite .",
    "[ setup ] shows the model and code setup .",
    "the mcfp code considers a cylindrical emission region , assumes axisymmetry for all physical properties , and divides the region evenly into multiple zones in the radial and longitudinal directions .",
    "the electron distribution in each zone evolves in time according to a locally isotropic fokker - planck equation .",
    "the disturbance is also a cylindrical region , which will instantaneously modify the physical conditions of the zones at its current location , hence modifying the fokker - planck evolution .",
    "when it moves out of a zone , the physical conditions will instantaneously be restored to the initial state . here",
    ", the physical meaning of an `` instantaneous '' change is that its time scale is less than one time step of the simulation .",
    "the code will then calculate the time - dependent emissivities based on the particle distribution at each time step , and apply a monte - carlo method to trace the photons and handle the compton scattering .",
    "therefore , all lttes are naturally included .",
    "all calculations are performed in the comoving frame of the emission region , and the resulting fluxes are properly transformed to the observer s frame at the end of the simulation .",
    "the 3dpol code is focused on the synchrotron polarization signatures .",
    "it uses the same geometry and physical conditions , and the particle distributions as calculated by the mcfp code .",
    "however , since the polarization requires a 3d description , the emission region is further divided evenly into multiple zones in the @xmath4 direction , but the axisymmetry of all parameters is still kept . since the environment of the emission region is generally considered as",
    "optically thin , and our treatment of the synchrotron polarization focuses on the high - frequency radio through optical / uv range , synchrotron - self absorption and faraday rotation effects are neglected in this study . as in the mcfp code",
    ", all calculations are performed in the comoving frame . in each zone , we project the magnetic field onto the plane of sky in the comoving frame , and use the time - dependent electron population generated by the mcfp code to evaluate the polarization degree ( @xmath5 ) at various frequencies .",
    "since the net electric vector is perpendicular to the projected magnetic field direction , the electric vector position angle , also known as the polarization angle ( @xmath6 ) , is easily obtained . in this way",
    ", we obtain the stokes parameters ( without normalization ) at various frequencies at every time step in each zone via @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spectral luminosity and the @xmath5 at frequency @xmath10 , respectively , and @xmath11 is the electric vector position angle for that zone .",
    "the code then employs ray - tracing to calculate the relative time delay to the observer for each zone , in order to take full account of the lttes .",
    "since the emissions from different zones are incoherent , the total stokes parameters can be obtained by linear addition of the stokes parameters from each zone for emissions reaching the observer at the same time .",
    "finally , as in the mcfp code , all emissions are properly lorentz transformed ( boosted ) to obtain the luminosity and polarization information in the observer s frame .    due to the relativistic aberration , even though we are observing blazars nearly along the jet in the observer s frame ( typically , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow along the jet ) , the angle @xmath14 between los and the jet axis in the comoving frame it is likely much larger . specifically , if @xmath15 , then @xmath16 .",
    "paper i has shown that the polarization signatures are only weakly dependent on the exact value of @xmath14 , thus in all of the following simulations , we choose @xmath16 in the comoving frame , and hence , the doppler factor @xmath17 \\right)^{-1 }   = \\gamma$ ] .    , @xmath4 , @xmath18 ) , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the number of zones in the respective directions .",

    "@xcite presented model fits to snap - shot seds and light curves , in which they found that the most favorable scenario is an external compton ( ec ) model with the external radiation field originating from a dusty torus .",
    "the purpose of this section is to study geometric effects on the polarization signatures , in particular the @xmath6 variability .",
    "the geometries are chosen in such a way that the first two cases correspond to @xmath27 @xmath6 swings , while the other two cases are aimed to study to study small - scale pa fluctuations . in order to facilitate a direct comparison with paper i",
    ", we choose the same quiescent state parameters , similar to those used in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we keep the assumption that the disturbance is due to a shock .",
    "however , the shock parameters and the geometry may vary . also , for the purpose of these generic case studies , we do not introduce any turbulent magnetic field contribution .",
    "since both the mcfp and 3dpol codes are time - dependent , we allow for an initial period for the electrons and the photons to reach equilibrium , before we introduce the parameter disturbance produced by the shock . in all our results the plots illustrate the results after this equilibrium has been reached .",
    "as the flaring activity exhibits different characteristics in duration and in strength for different cases , we define similar phases in the flare development for the purpose of a direct comparison .",
    "these phases correspond approximately to the pre - flare , early flare , flare peak , late flare , and post - flare states .",
    "we define the @xmath6 in our simulations as follows .",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to the electric field vector being parallel to the projection of the cylindrical axis on the plane of sky .",

    "the fokker - planck equation takes into account the acceleration time - scale @xmath42 and escape time - scale @xmath43 , both in units of @xmath44 ; however , the total number of electrons is conserved , hence the escaping electrons will be balanced by thermal electrons picked up from the background . in the quiescent state the emission region is pervaded by a helical magnetic field @xmath45 oriented at a pitch angle @xmath46 , and possibly a turbulent contribution , where the total magnetic - field strength is @xmath47 . however , in this geometric effect study , we do not introduce any turbulence , therefore @xmath48 .",
    "initially a power - law distribution of nonthermal electrons with a power - index @xmath49 and minimum and maximum energies @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , with density @xmath52 , will have evolved to an equilibrium according to the fokker - planck equation in the emission region before the interaction with the disturbance .",
    "the disturbance will change the layers in the emission region at its location into an active state . in cases 1 , 2 and 4 ,",
    "the disturbance , which is in the form of a shock , will compress the local magnetic field , so that the magnetic field strength will be amplified by a factor of @xmath53 , and the pitch angle will change to @xmath54 . in case 3 , the shock will instead shorten the acceleration time scale by a factor of @xmath55 , so as to increase the acceleration efficiency .",
    "in this scenario , the shock will instantaneously increase the toroidal magnetic field component at its location , probably by compression , so that it will increase the total magnetic field strength and change its orientation in the affected zones",
    ". the new magnetic field will be kept until the shock moves out of that zone , when it instantaneously reverts back to its original ( quiescent ) strength and orientation , which can be attributed to dissipation .",
    "paper i has considered a very extreme case , where the shock increases the toroidal component by a factor of ten , so that the total magnetic field is increased by approximately a factor of seven , and @xmath46 increases from initially @xmath30 to approximately @xmath57 . such strong alteration in the magnetic field results in a drastic change in the polarization signatures ; however it will require a huge amount of energy conversion within small time windows when the disturbance is turned on and off , which is unlikely to happen in practice .",
    "here we investigate a case with a moderate change in the magnetic field , where @xmath46 of the total magnetic field increases from @xmath30 to @xmath58 . to mimic a spherical volume for the emission region , we choose @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 , and the disturbance will occupy the entire layer , i.e. , @xmath61 ( hereafter geometry i ) .",
    "since the total magnetic field is not increased much , we observe in fig .",
    "[ case11 ] ( upper left ) that the synchrotron flux exhibits only a small flare .",
    "it is also obvious that the @xmath5 is photon - energy dependent ( fig .",
    "[ case11 ] lower left ) since pks  1510 - 089 has a visible external thermal component emerging at optical - uv frequencies , which diminishes the observed polarization percentage , especially in the uv .",

    "[ case11 ] ( lower left ) show the intrinsic @xmath5 without the thermal contamination .",
    "the spectral curvature of the realistic electron spectrum from the detailed simulation based on the fokker - planck equation leads to an additional frequency dependence of the @xmath5 .",
    "the features above @xmath62  ev are due to the electron spectral cutoff . for the time dependence of the polarization signatures ,",
    "the @xmath5 gradually decreases to nearly zero at the flare peak , then recovers back to its initial state at the end of the flare .",
    "moreover , the @xmath6 shows a continuous @xmath27 swing , except for the radio / mm polarization , which is due to the extremely small flare amplitude at low frequencies .",
    "as is elaborated below and in paper i , such polarization variability features can be explained as the combined effect of electron evolution and lttes .",
    "initially , the directions of the projected magnetic field will cover the range of @xmath34 to @xmath30 .",
    "due to the axisymmetry of the initial conditions , the initial @xmath63 component will be balanced out , hence the initial stokes vector is @xmath64 , leaving @xmath6 at @xmath65 ( equivalent to @xmath32 ) .",
    "when the shock moves into the emission region , it will increase the toroidal component of the magnetic field at its location , resulting in stronger emission and enhanced synchrotron cooling ( fig .",
    "[ electronspectrum ] left )",
    ". additionally , during the presence of the disturbance , the active region has @xmath66 .",
    "the combined effect is that the active region will have a larger contribution to the polarization , with the stokes parameters generally in the form of @xmath33 or @xmath37 . due to lttes , although the shock is flat in the co - moving frame , the active region at equal photon - arrival times will be distorted , as shown in fig . [ sketch]a , b. in the early flare phase , only the region facing the observer ( red in fig . [ sketch",
    "] ) contributes to the flare , where the initial stokes parameters in the form of @xmath31 will be replaced by the active state @xmath33 .",
    "therefore the initial @xmath67 will gradually move to @xmath68 , and the @xmath5 will decrease at the same time .",
    "when the flare gradually rises up to its peak , emission from the far side of the cylinder can be seen , which possess negative @xmath69 component .",
    "this will diminish the positive @xmath69 from the right side of the cylinder , meanwhile the initial negative @xmath70 has mostly be canceled out . consequently the @xmath5 will continue to drop , and the @xmath6 will rotate from @xmath68 to @xmath27 . when the flare reaches its maximum ( green in fig .",
    "[ sketch]b ) , for a short period the shock - enhanced fluxes from both sides of the cylinder will be comparable . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath69 component will be canceled out , leaving a positive @xmath70 in the active region and a negative @xmath70 in the quiescent region .",
    "if the shock is adequately strong , the polarization contributed by the active region will be higher , leading to a positive @xmath70 for this short period .",

    "the low - frequency component of the sed is dominated by synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons , along with a weak thermal component from the central accretion disk around the black hole powering the relativistic jet .",
    "we assume a leptonic origin for the high - energy component of the sed , which is composed of an ssc contribution , dominating from x - rays to soft gamma - rays , and an ec contribution which dominates the emission in the fermi ( @xmath93 ) range .",
    "we also assume that there exists a turbulent magnetic field component , which is initially uniform everywhere .",
    "we assume the disturbance to be associated with a magnetic energy dissipation process , e.g. , magnetic reconnection , instead of a shock .",
    "it has been suggested that magnetic reconnection can dissipate a large fraction of the magnetic energy to produce a nonthermal power - law distribution of relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "a possible underlying physical picture is that on the trajectory of the emission region , it encounters a flat stationary region , where the poloidal component of the helical magnetic field is in the opposite direction of that in the emission region .",
    "therefore the poloidal component will be dissipated during the presence of the disturbance , due to magnetic reconnection , leading to particle acceleration ( we use a simple injection to mimic this effect ) and a locally stronger turbulent magnetic - field component @xcite .",
    "the time - dependence of the polarization signatures is similar to case 1 of the previous section . before interacting with the disturbance ,",
    "the entire emission region contributes uniformly , and therefore , due to the axisymmetry of the underlying geometry and the mildly stronger poloidal component ( @xmath94 ) in the quiescent state , the polarization is dominated by the poloidal contribution . when the interaction with the disturbance starts ( red in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) , we assume that the poloidal component in this area decreases , but the toroidal component remains nearly unaffected , hence the quiescent - state polarization will be gradually canceled out by the flaring toroidal contribution . as a result , the @xmath5 drops and the @xmath6 starts to rotate towards the dominant toroidal direction .",
    "as the disturbance moves forward , the flaring region becomes larger , resulting in increasing fluxes in both the synchrotron and the compton emissions . towards the end of the interaction period , the flaring region ( green in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) reaches its maximum size , leading to the observed flux maximum .",
    "meanwhile , the magnetic field throughout the green flaring region in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] has approximately equal contributions from the near and far sides of the cylinder , mimicking the initial axisymmetry , except for a mildly stronger toroidal magnetic - field contribution ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "this flaring toroidal contribution is just strong enough to dominate over the poloidal contribution in the quiescent state .",
    "consequently , the @xmath5 drops to nearly zero , while the @xmath6 reflects the dominant toroidal magnetic - field direction .",
    "after this flux peak , the flaring region gradually becomes smaller and moves to the upper - left ( blue in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) , and the light curves and @xmath5 recover to their initial states with approximately time - symmetric profiles .",
    "however , since the toroidal component on the far side of the cylinder is opposite to that on the near side , the @xmath6 instead completes a @xmath96 swing to a direction that is indistinguishable from its initial position due to the @xmath27 ambiguity of the @xmath6 .     and",
    "@xmath6 vs. time : black squares and hollow magenta circles are from the second and the first flare , respectively ; curves are the simulated polarization signatures .",
    "[ fitting],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "polarization signatures are known to be highly variable , and @xmath2 polarization angle swings are frequently observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , the observed @xmath2 @xmath6 swings are accompanied by one or several sequential apparently symmetric @xmath5 patterns which drops from an initial value to zero then reverts back .",
    "in addition , both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 patterns appear to be smooth .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the @xmath6 rotations , such as an emission region moving along a curved trajectory or a bending jet , or streamlines following helical magnetic - field lines , or stochastic activation of individual zones in a turbulent jet @xcite . while they may have their own virtue in understanding polarization variations ,",
    "none of these models has so far been able to explain spectral variability properties , symmetric light - curve profiles , and correlated symmetric polarization variability features in one coherent model . on the other hand , the lttes coupled with an axisymmetric emission region in our model naturally explain the apparently time - symmetric features of multi - wavelength light curves and polarization variations and their intrinsic correlations , which also appears to be the simplest model with the smallest number of fine - tunable parameters .    based on our model",
    ", the continuous @xmath27 @xmath6 swings will pose some serious constraints on the physical background of the emission region , namely : the pitch angles of the quiescent and the active states shall be on each side of a critical point @xmath97 , a moderate strength of flare , a moderate change of the pitch angle of the helical magnetic field , and a geometry of the emission region where @xmath98 . if the pitch angles of the quiescent state and the active state are both within the range of @xmath29 to @xmath97 or @xmath97 to @xmath32 , where in our case @xmath99 , then the projected magnetic field will always provide the total stokes parameters in the form of @xmath100 or @xmath101 , respectively , resulting in the @xmath6 fluctuating around @xmath65 or @xmath27 , respectively . additionally ,",
    "if the flare amplitude or the pitch angle change is too weak , then throughout the flaring activity the total polarization signatures will be dominated by the quiescent state , therefore @xmath6 will not complete a @xmath27 swing . while if on the other hand they are too strong , then the active region will dominate the polarization signatures for a much longer time , giving rise to a step - like feature as shown in paper i. notice that , however , this feature is different from the `` step - phase '' feature introduced by a @xmath81 geometry ( case 2 ) , because the step - like feature caused by strong variations can only reach @xmath27 at the very peak of the flare , where the @xmath69 component of the stokes parameters can be fully canceled out . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` step - phase '' due to the geometry can be diagnosed in the observation as completely flat @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above constraints , a simultaneous fitting of all spectral , light curve , and polarization properties can exclude a wide range of possible scenarios .",
    "therefore , our fitting results place unprecedented constraints , most of which do not depend on the details of the model .",
    "since in a leptonic model interpretation , the gamma - rays from 3c279 are produced by the ec process , an excess of either external photon field or nonthermal electrons is necessary to produce a gamma - ray flare .",
    "however , the former fails to produce the data , since such excess is unlikely to generate a correlated , time - symmetric multi - wavelength flare , but instead may lead to an anti - correlated behavior in the synchrotron emission due to excess radiative cooling .",
    "also , the infrared - to - optical flare amplitude is smaller than that of the gamma - ray flare , and the x - ray emission , which represents the low - energy end of the ssc emission , shows almost no variability .",
    "this implies that the total magnetic field strength has to decrease during the flare .",
    "we suggest that the dissipated magnetic energy can be converted into nonthermal particle energy through magnetic reconnection .",
    "most importantly , as we have discussed above , a smooth @xmath6 rotation and the nearly zero @xmath5 at the flare peak ( green in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) imply that the toroidal magnetic - field component should be mildly stronger than the poloidal one in the active state .",
    "however , since the excess of nonthermal electrons and the amount of the magnetic field alteration , which are linked by the reconnection process , have been well constrained , the poloidal and toroidal b - field components should remain comparable throughout the process .",
    "moreover , the relative percentage of the turbulent magnetic - field contribution increases in the active state .",
    "nevertheless , we notice that , just like most multiwavelength models of blazar emission , our model underestimates the radio flux , and also overestimates the @xmath5 there .",
    "this is because the radio emission is known to be produced on larger scales , on which the magnetic field appears more disordered .",
    "in addition , the environment in which our emission region is located is still opaque to radio emission .",
    "models of relativistic shocks propagating through the jet have been widely used to explain blazar flaring activities @xcite .",
    "such models naturally provide excess nonthermal electrons .",
    "however , they are expected to compress the magnetic field , leading to a change in @xmath46 with an increase in the overall magnetic - field strength .",
    "consequently , shocks are unlikely to fit our constraints .",
    "alternatively , the fitting constraints strongly favor a magnetic energy dissipation process during the flare .",
    "we find in our simulation that the dissipated magnetic energy during the disturbance is comparable to the necessary amount of particle energy increase required to generates the flare .",
    "simulations of magnetic energy dissipation have demonstrated that the energy stored in magnetic shear can be efficiently converted into a power - law distribution of relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "this process will reduce the magnetic field component that is subject to dissipation and can therefore change the magnetic - field pitch angle .",
    "moreover , the magnetic - field topology inside the dissipation zone is likely to become turbulent , thus it will strengthen the turbulent magnetic - field contribution @xcite .    for the smaller fluctuations in the polarization signatures ( generally @xmath6 varies by @xmath102 )",
    ", although some apparently symmetric profiles can be noticed , the general patterns appear very complicated @xcite .",
    "in addition , those fluctuations often happen during the quiescent states , with lower @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that some inhomogeneity and more complex geometry , or some turbulence are required @xcite .",
    "we suggest that , if a step phase along with time - symmetric variability of the polarization features is observed , especially in the @xmath6 profile , as it will be less affected by a possible turbulent b - field component , this may serve as a powerful constraint on the size and the geometry of the emission region . since the step phase will serve as a measure of the length of @xmath103 , while the two symmetric @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) alterations will imply the length of @xmath41 . in this way , the size and the geometry of the region that is affected by the disturbance can be constrained , while the size of the entire emission region can then be estimated by the flux and polarization percentage ."
