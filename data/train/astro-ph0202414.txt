    "the origin of the unidentified egret @xmath0-ray sources in the galactic plane has been puzzling since their discovery .",
    "the third egret catalog @xcite lists 57 unidentified sources at low galactic latitude ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "rotation - powered pulsars are likely to account for part of these gev @xmath0-ray sources ; five pulsars have been detected at gev energies to date .",
    "another possible origin for some of the unidentified sources is the emission from accelerated cosmic - rays at the shock of shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "it is reported that the probability to find egret unidentified sources in the vicinity of shell - type snrs is significantly high @xcite .",
    "although the relatively young snrs , being in their sedov phase , are natural sites of high energy @xmath0-ray production through electron bremsstrahlung and hadronic interactions , it has been recognized that in most cases the expected @xmath0-ray fluxes at mev / gev energies are too low to be detected by egret @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath0-ray fluxes can be dramatically enhanced in snrs having dense gas environments , e.g. , in large molecular clouds overtaken by supernova shells @xcite .",
    "remarkably , among the snrs possibly detected by egret are the radio - bright and nearby objects @xmath0  cygni , ic  443 , w44 , and w28 @xcite that are all associated with molecular clouds .",
    "the recent searches for snrs in the vicinity of some of the unidentified egret sources revealed new evidence of @xmath0-ray emission from `` supernova remnant  molecular cloud '' interacting systems @xcite .",
    "if gamma - rays of such systems have hadronic origin , and the acceleration of protons extends to 10 tev and beyond , the tev @xmath0-ray emission from these objects should be detectable also by current ground - based detectors @xcite . at energies below the threshold of production of @xmath5-decay @xmath0-rays around 70 mev ,",
    "the electron bremsstrahlung remains the only noticeable @xmath0-ray production process .",
    "therefore , the detection of @xmath0-rays by egret down to several tens of mev implies the existence of low - energy ( @xmath6  mev ) electrons in these objects .",
    "the best information about higher energy electrons , typically between 1 and 10 gev electrons , is provided by the synchrotron radio emission at ghz frequencies .",
    "the accelerated electrons produce also nonthermal x - rays through the synchrotron radiation and the bremsstrahlung .",
    "both channels contain unique information about the nonthermal electron populations at extremely high ( multi - tev ) , and very low ( sub - mev ) energies , respectively .",
    "thus , the x - ray observations may help to reveal the nature of the unidentified egret sources that are associated with snrs by looking for ultrarelativistic and subrelativistic electrons , and probing the environments of the remnants .",
    "the @xmath0  cygni ( g78.2 + 2.1 ) snr has a clear position - correlation with the brightest unidentified @xmath0-ray source 3eg  j2020 + 4017 .",
    "it is a nearby ( 12  kpc ) shell - type snr with the radio shell of @xmath7 diameter @xcite .",
    "the radio flux density of 340 jy at 1 ghz ranks it as the fourth brightest snr in the sky at this frequency @xcite .",
    "almost 60% of the radio flux comes from southeastern part which has been known as dr4 @xcite .",
    "the spectral index of the radio spectrum averaged over the whole remnant is measured as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "its variation across the remnant is as small as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the egret source has the steady flux of @xmath10 and a best - fit power - law index of @xmath11 @xcite . prior to the egret detection , @xmath0-ray source 2cg078 + 2",
    "was detected in the vicinity of @xmath0  cygni with the _ cos - b _ satellite @xcite . despite extensive searches for tev @xmath0-ray emission ,",
    "significant excesses have not been detected @xcite .",
    "since a simple extrapolation of the egret flux exceeds the whipple upper limit by an order - of - magnitude , the spectrum must have a cutoff or steepen well below the tev energy @xcite .",
    "presented here are the results from and implications of _ asca _ observations of the @xmath0  cygni snr .",
    "of particular interest is the discovery of hard x - ray emission localized to the northern part of @xmath0  cygni .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "observations are briefly summarized in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we perform the x - ray image analysis in  [ sec : ximage ] and the spectral fits in  [ sec : xspec ] . in  [ subsec : cloud ] , we interpret the soft x - ray data in terms of shock  cloud interaction .",
    "the origin of the hard x - ray emission is discussed in  [ sec : nonthermal ] .",
    "we performed _ asca _ observations of @xmath0  cygni snr twice in 1996 and 1997 .",
    "the northern part of the remnant was observed for 40 ks in 1996 may .",
    "observations were carried out in 1997 may with three pointings toward the north , south , and east of @xmath0  cygni with 60 , 16 , and 12 ks duration , respectively .",
    "the data from two gas imaging spectrometer @xcite detectors were acquired in the standard pulse - height mode .",
    "two solid - state imaging spectrometer @xcite detectors were operated in 4-ccd mode . each detector is coupled to its own telescope with nested conical foil mirrors .",
    "once combined all observations , field of view ( fov ) of gis covers almost all part of the remnant .",
    "the data from the detectors were screened by standard procedures , except for the strict rise - time screening in the gis analysis , because of the mode we chose for the operation .",
    "the observed count rate for the north of @xmath0  cygni was 0.57 ( 0.59 ) counts / s within a central 20  radius in the 0.710 kev energy band with gis2 ( gis3 ) .",
    "the degradation of the sis performance due to the accumulated radiation damage in orbit is found to be substantial in our data .",
    "even for the data taken with faint mode , in which rdd ( residual dark distribution ) correction can be applied , the spectral resolution of sis is found to be of no advantage to that of gis .",
    "in addition , the smaller effective area at high energies and the narrower fov for sis than those for gis do not serve our purpose .",
    "the results presented in this paper are from the gis data .",
    "the _ asca _ gis data for the four pointings were combined to construct the x - ray images in selected energy bands .",
    "we discard the data outside the central region of the detector with a radius greater than 20 . by utilizing the night - earth observation data set",
    ", we subtract the instrumental background from each pointing data .",
    "since we did not obtain the rise - time information , the normalization of the background image is increased by 30% as compared with the nominal case .",
    "the background - subtracted images are combined with corrections for the exposure time and the vignetting effects .",
    "finally the images are smoothed with a function comprised of a narrow core ( @xmath12 ) and a broad wing to simulate the point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope .",
    "figure  [ fig : ximage]_a _ , [ fig : ximage]_b _ , and [ fig : ximage]_c _ show the resultant x - ray images in 0.71  kev ( soft ) , 13  kev ( medium ) , and 47  kev ( hard ) energy bands , respectively .",
    "we find strikingly different appearance of the snr in these energy bands . in the soft band image",
    ", clumpy sources appear at north and limb - brightened emission is seen at south .",
    "the medium image shows widespread emission distributed from north to southeast , in addition to the southern bright shell . in the hard energy band ,",
    "several clumpy sources in the north region stand out dramatically ( figure  [ fig : ximage]_c _ ) .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the clump centered at a celestial coordinate ( j2000 ) of _ _ r.a.__@xmath13 , _ _ decl.__@xmath14 as c1 and the other one at _ _",
    "r.a.__@xmath15 , _ _ decl.__@xmath16 as c2 .",
    "since another hard source c3 is located at the western edge of the fov , we do not report a spectral study of c3 in this paper .",
    "the hard source c2 appears to be extended by a few arcminutes . in order to evaluate quantitatively , we compared the count rate profile centered on the clump c2 with the detector psf in the 310  kev band , as plotted in figure  [ fig : radial ] .",
    "the background level shown there is taken from the southern part of the remnant .",
    "it is obvious that the hard x - ray emission extends up to 46  beyond the radial profile of a single point source . in figure",
    "[ fig : radial ] , we also plot the simulated profile of a circular source which has uniform surface brightness with a radius of 4  centered on c2 . on the other hand ,",
    "we obtain no sign of spatial extension of the source c1 .    in order to compare the x - ray distribution with radio synchrotron emission ,",
    "the x - ray images on gray scale are overlaid with the 4850 mhz radio contours in figure  [ fig : ximage ] .",
    "the x - ray sources at the north coincide with the radio - bright region and the southern x - ray shell with a fainter radio arc .",
    "the x - ray morphology in general bears close resemblance to the radio on large scales , but the x - ray emission in the proximity of the region r2 appears to anticorrelate with the radio emission .",
    "the dr4 , brightest radio region at the southeast , is quite dim in the x - ray band .",
    "it is noticeable that there are enhancements of radio emission possibly associated with the hard sources c1 and c2 .",
    "the second @xcite and third @xcite egret catalog report somewhat different positions for the unidentified @xmath0-ray source inside @xmath0  cygni . in figure",
    "[ fig : ximage]_c _ we superimpose their 95% confidence error contours which are approximated as circles .",
    "whereas @xcite reported a point - like x - ray source rx  j2020.2 + 4026 by rosat close to the remnant center and within the egret error circle , no point sources were detected there by our _ asca _ observations .",
    "the flux of rx  j2020.2 + 4026 , estimated to be @xmath17 assuming a photon index of 2 , is indeed below the sensitivity of our observation . in  [ sec : nonthermal ] we discuss a possible connection between the hard x - ray sources and the egret unidentified @xmath0-ray emission .      for the purpose of spectroscopic studies of the x - ray emissions associated with the @xmath0  cygni snr ,",
    "contaminating emission that is overlapping the remnant must be taken into account adequately because the line of sight toward @xmath0  cygni passes along the orion - cygnus spiral arm .",
    "because of the lack of a blank field in our observations , we analyzed four _ asca _ archive data in neighboring fields ( field  14 in table  [ tbl : cygnus ] ) to estimate the x - ray emission at the @xmath0  cygni field unrelated to the snr itself .",
    "for each field , the gis spectrum is obtained by integrated over the central detector region with a radius of 20   after eliminating resolved sources .",
    "each spectrum is subtracted by the high - latitude blank - sky spectrum as a sum of the cosmic x - ray background and the instrumental background .",
    "figure  [ fig : cygnus ] shows the resulting spectra in the 1.22.5  kev and 3.58  kev band , after the correction for the integration sky area .",
    "we find similar energy spectra from these neighborhood fields , except for field  2 where the galactic latitude is highest and the galactic column density is lowest as compared with the other fields .",
    "once field  2 is excluded , field - to - field variations of spectral data in the soft band are found to be insignificant .",
    "the hard 3.58  kev spectrum of the southern field of @xmath0  cygni is in agreement with those of field  3 and 4 within their statistical uncertainties .",
    "consequently , we consider that field  3 and 4 provide us a good approximation of the contaminating emission that should be subtracted from the spectral data of @xmath0  cygni . since no bright sources are found in the _ asca _ data of field  4 , we have chosen field  4 as `` background '' field .",
    "we derive energy spectra of regions r1r3 and clumps c1 and c2 .",
    "the clump spectra are extracted from the circular regions of a radius of 6 .",
    "we exclude photons falling within 6  radius centered on c1 and c2 from the spectrum of the region r1 .",
    "each accumulated on - source spectrum is subtracted by the `` background '' field  4 spectrum that is extracted from an identical detector region to each on - source data . to improve statistics , spectra of two gis detectors",
    "are always added .",
    "background - subtracted spectra of r1/r3 and c2 are shown in figure  [ fig : xspec ] and figure  [ fig : xspec2 ] , respectively .",
    "several emission lines of mg k ( @xmath18 kev ) and si k ( @xmath19 kev ) are evident in every spectra , indicative of thin thermal plasma with a typical temperature of @xmath20 kev .",
    "remarkably , the spectrum of c2 exhibits very flat continuum emission above 3  kev .",
    "there are known errors in the calibration of the conversion of the photon energies to the pulse invariant channels of the gis detector below the xenon - l edge of 4.8 kev . in the following spectral",
    "fitting , an artificial energy shift of @xmath21 ev to each applied model is introduced to alleviate these errors @xcite .",
    "we have first attempted to fit the 0.78 kev spectrum of r3 by a thin thermal plasma model @xcite in which collisional equilibrium ionization ( cei ) is realized .",
    "photoelectric absorption along the line of sight is taken into account using the cross - sections from @xcite .",
    "elemental abundances are fixed to the solar values of @xcite throughout this paper unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "the cei plasma model can not give an acceptable fit owing to a large discrepancy between the actual data and the model between mg and si k emission lines .",
    "even when the abundances of alpha elements ne , mg , si , s , and fe are individually allowed to vary ranging from 0.1 to 10 solar , the spectral data can not be described properly . in order to model emission line features ,",
    "we take account of the effects of non - equilibrium ionization @xcite by adopting a plasma emission code based on @xcite . in an nei plasma ,",
    "degree of ionization and consequently line emissivities depend on the ionization timescale @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the electron density and @xmath24 the passage time after shocked .",
    "the nei plasma model yields an acceptable fit with a reduced @xmath25 .",
    "the best - fit temperature and ionization timescale with @xmath26 errors are @xmath27  kev and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "we found the r1 spectrum , as compared with r3 , shows distinctive features , namely a strong emission at @xmath29 kev and a hard continuum above 3  kev .",
    "the former is consistent with the fact that r1 is very bright particularly in the 0.71  kev energy band ; the latter could be contamination by the hard sources c1 and c2 . regarding the spectral fit of r1",
    ", we include helium - like neon ( ) k@xmath30 line ( 0.923  kev ) , in addition to the cei plasma model that predominantly describes the 13  kev emission . the cei plasma plus line model , however , can not give a statistically acceptable fit , owing to residuals by the hard continuum .",
    "then , by adding power - law as a third component to describe the hard continuum , we obtain an acceptable fit for the r1 spectrum as summarized in table  [ tbl : fit ] .",
    "the best - fit temperature is @xmath31  kev ; the photon index of the power - law component is @xmath32 .",
    "the spectrum of the region r2 is fitted by a cei plasma model alone .",
    "the simple model yields an acceptable fit with the temperature of @xmath33  kev , which is in complete agreement with the value obtained for the region r1 .",
    "the spectral data of the clump c2 indicate the presence of a hard continuum emission in the 38  kev energy band .",
    "the hard emission is seen in the spectrum of c1 as well .",
    "as the case of r1 , we employ a three - component model comprised of the line ( 0.92  kev ) , cei thermal plasma , and power - law spectrum . we find that a good fit can not be obtained if we omit the power - law component .",
    "we fitted the three - component model to the 0.78  kev spectral data of the clumps c1 and c2 , by freezing the plasma temperature to the best - fit value of the region r1 and attenuating all components with a common absorption column of @xmath34 that is also obtained for r1 .",
    "the power - law components are found to be very flat ; the best - fit photon indices are @xmath35 and @xmath36 for c1 and c2 , respectively . instead of adding a power - law",
    ", we also attempted to add a thermal bremsstrahlung component to model the high - energy part of the c2 spectrum .",
    "the 90% lower - limit on the temperature of the thermal bremsstrahlung emission is set to be @xmath37 kev .",
    "@xcite derived the distance to @xmath0  cygni as @xmath38  kpc based on the @xmath39@xmath40 relation which is a statistical property of the radio brightness of snrs .",
    "@xcite estimated as @xmath41  kpc and pointed out the progenitor of the @xmath0  cygni remnant was possibly a member of the cyg  ob9 association at @xmath42  kpc .",
    "the absorbing column density provides additional information about the distance .",
    "@xcite reported wolf - rayet binary v444  cyg  located close to the @xmath0  cygni sky field is attenuated by the interstellar column density of @xmath43 , similar to the @xmath0  cygni remnant .",
    "thus , we expect the distance to @xmath0  cygni is probably close to the distance to v444  cyg , 1.7 kpc . in view of these arguments ,",
    "we take the distance @xmath44  kpc as most probable value .",
    "the x - ray distribution of the region r3 shows clear arc - like morphology along the outer boundary of the shell structure observed at radio frequencies .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was modeled by a single temperature thermal emission with the solar abundance .",
    "these features are indicative of a thin thermal plasma in the immediate postshock region of the primary blast wave propagating through the interstellar matter .",
    "assuming the equipartition between the shocked electrons and ions and rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for a strong shock , the electron temperature is related to the shock velocity @xmath45 as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a mean mass per particle in units of the proton mass @xmath48 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath27  kev corresponds to the shock velocity @xmath49 km / s .    provided that the remnant is in the sedov adiabatic expansion phase",
    ", the age of @xmath0  cygni can be estimated to be @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the radius of the supernova shock front . given the angular radius of @xmath52",
    ", we have the physical radius @xmath53  pc , where @xmath54 is the distance in units of @xmath55  kpc .",
    "thus , we obtain an age estimate of @xmath56 yr .      on the basis of the line emission and absorption toward the @xmath0  cygni snr",
    ", @xcite suggested that the supernova explosion took place in the slab of an interstellar cloud oriented north to southeast .",
    "the soft ( 13  kev ) x - ray emission `` belt '' from north to southeast appears to agree fairly well with the spatial distribution of the line features . a possible scenario explaining this coincidence is that the x - ray emission belt is due to thermal evaporation of clouds @xcite as a consequence of the collision between the supernova blast wave and the dense clouds",
    ". the supernova shock may expand into a cavity produced by progenitor stellar winds , and then encounter the cavity wall comprised of the clouds @xcite .",
    "we found the possible evidence of the strong emission line of helium - like ne from the r1 spectrum .",
    "the x - ray map in the 0.71  kev band suggests clumpy nature of the line emission .",
    "the upper limit for the hydrogen - like ne line intensity is found to be 6.7% of the helium - like intensity .",
    "this gives an upper limit of 0.24  kev for the temperature of plasma emitting the line if we assume ionization equilibrium state .",
    "the low - temperature and clumpy appearance are indicative of the shock  cloud interactions at the northern part of the remnant .    the hard sources c1 and c2 reside in the northern region where the shock  cloud interaction is likely to occur .",
    "therefore , we identify the hard sources with shocked dense cloudlets",
    ". this speculation may be encouraged by the presence of high - velocity cloudlets with a density of 10100  @xmath57 and an apparent radius of 46   in the southeast of the remnant @xcite .",
    "let us calculate the density of plasma that is responsible for the derived ne flux @xmath58  photons  @xmath59s@xmath60 of the clump c1(c2 ) with reasonable parameters .",
    "given a temperature of 0.1  kev and a spherical volume of an angular radius of 2  ( assuming distance @xmath44 kpc ) , we have the density @xmath61  @xmath57 by using the ne line emissivity of @xcite , in agreement with the typical density of cloudlets .",
    "an important finding of our observations is the clumpy hard x - ray emissions from the regions c1 and c2 ( hereafter , hxc  the hard x - ray clump ) .",
    "we found that c2 has an extended structure with an effective radius of about @xmath62 .",
    "the hxc components are extremely hard and characterized by a power - law with @xmath63  0.81.5 . as we argued above , it is likely the hxc originates in shocked dense cloudlets with a gas density between 10 and 100 @xmath3 .",
    "the thermal - bremsstrahlung interpretation of the high - energy part of the c2 spectrum requires very high temperature ( @xmath64  kev )",
    ". since the shocks of an evolved snr are not sufficiently energetic to heat the gas to such temperatures , the nonthermal origin of the hard x - ray emission seems a more favorable option .",
    "the synchrotron radiation , the inverse - compton scattering , and the nonthermal bremsstrahlung of shock - accelerated electrons are three natural production mechanisms of hard x - rays . the overall flux of the hxc in the 210  kev interval is estimated as @xmath65 , which corresponds to the source luminosity @xmath66 .    the nonthermal luminosity of this snr peaks at high energy @xmath0-rays , if the association with the egret source is real .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum measured by egret is shown in figure  [ fig : nufnu ] , together with the hxc spectrum .",
    "the observed photon flux of the egret source is translated into a luminosity of @xmath67 ( 100  mev2  gev ) for the photon index @xmath68 .",
    "the reported positions of the egret @xmath0-ray source 2eg  j2020 + 4026 and/or 3eg  j2020 + 4017 do not coincide exactly with the hxc .",
    "however the large systematic errors in the egret position , which strongly depend on the chosen diffuse @xmath0-ray emission model @xcite , do not allow certain conclusions concerning the location of the @xmath0-ray production region .",
    "therefore it is interesting to test whether the hxc can be a counterpart of the unidentified gev @xmath0-rays source on theoretical ground .",
    "the emission region of the hxc is supposed to be the dense cloudlet engulfed by the supernova blast wave , and therefore the density is probably high ( @xmath69  10100  @xmath57 ) .",
    "below we assume that accelerated electrons are continuously injected in the hxc , by the accelerator(s ) being located either outside or inside the hxc .",
    "possible internal accelerator could be the secondary shocks generated by the interaction between the primary blast wave and the dense cloudlets .",
    "indeed , @xcite considered electron acceleration at a slow shock ( the order of 100  km / s ) transmitted inside a dense cloudlet .",
    "a tail shock could be formed behind the cloudlets @xcite as well , although an efficient particle acceleration at the tail shock is not obvious . on the other hand , the external accelerator should be the primary shock of the snr .",
    "the energy spectrum of accelerated electrons depends on the acceleration mechanism , the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this paper . for simplicity",
    "we assume the electron production rate in momentum space is described by a single power - law function @xmath70 .",
    "such a function implies power - law distributions of electrons also in the kinetic energy space , although in the non - relativistic and ultrarelativistic regimes the power - law indices are different , namely @xmath71 at @xmath72 while @xmath73 at @xmath74 , where @xmath75 . in the case of diffusive shock acceleration at the shock front , according to the standard model @xcite , the spectral index is determined by the compression ratio of the shock as @xmath76 . for strong shocks with @xmath77 the spectral index is close to 2 .    for simplicity",
    "we suppose that the electrons are effectively trapped in hxc ; thus the present - day electron spectrum is formed by accumulation of freshly accelerated ( or arriving from external accelerators ) electrons during the entire history of the hxc .",
    "if the energy - losses can be neglected , the electron spectrum becomes @xmath78 , where the age of the accelerator is approximated by the age of @xmath0  cygni , i.e. @xmath79  yr .",
    "it is valid , however , only in the intermediate energy region , typically between 300 mev to 10 gev , where the bremsstrahlung dominates the radiative losses .",
    "indeed , the characteristic lifetime of electrons against the bremsstrahlung losses , @xmath80 is considerably larger than the age of @xmath0  cygni as long as the gas density does not exceed @xmath81 .",
    "the high density and presumably strong magnetic field in the hxc make , however , the cooling processes crucial in the formation of the electron spectrum at low and very high energies .",
    "the relevant cooling processes are the coulomb ( or , in the neutral gas , ionization ) losses for low - energy electrons and the synchrotron losses for high - energy electrons .",
    "the inverse - compton losses could be omitted if the magnetic field in hxc exceeds @xmath82 .",
    "also , it should be noticed that even in case of significant bremsstrahlung losses ( @xmath83 ) , the process does not modify the electron spectrum .",
    "below several hundreds mev , the energy losses of electrons are dominated ( independent of the gas density ) by the coulomb losses @xcite .",
    "the cooling time of electrons due to the coulomb interactions is given by @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath86 is the velocity of light , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the kinetic energy and the velocity of nonthermal electrons in units of @xmath86 , @xmath89 is the electron mass , and @xmath90 is the coulomb logarithm which is set to be 40 . equating @xmath91 and @xmath92 gives the break energy @xmath93 , `` coulomb break '' , below which the electron spectrum is flattened : @xmath94 where we use the approximation of @xmath95 . at energies below @xmath93 the coulomb losses significantly modify the acceleration spectrum , @xmath96 ; namely , at relativistic energies , @xmath97 .",
    "the differential energy spectrum of the bremsstrahlung emission from these electrons is calculated as @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are hydrogen , helium , and electron number densities , respectively , and @xmath102 is the differential cross - section for emitting a bremsstrahlung photon in the energy interval @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "we adopt ratios @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in the ultrarelativistic regime",
    "the electron - electron bremsstrahlung becomes comparable to the electron - proton bremsstrahlung .",
    "since the bremsstrahlung cross - section is in inverse proportion to the emitted photon energy , @xmath107 , and only slightly ( logarithmically ) depends on the electron energy in the relativistic regime , the bremsstrahlung photon spectrum almost repeats the power - law spectrum of parent electron distribution of @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath109 if @xmath110 .",
    "then , we should expect a broken power - law spectrum with @xmath111 at @xmath112 , and @xmath113 at @xmath114 in the relativistic domain .",
    "the energy spectrum of bremsstrahlung photons is essentially determined by the gas density and the age . below the `` coulomb break '' , for any reasonable acceleration index of @xmath115 ,",
    "we see a hard differential spectrum with a photon index less than 1.5 . it should be stressed that , for the electron spectrum harder than @xmath116 ( @xmath117 in the non - relativistic case ) , the bremsstrahlung photons obey a standard @xmath118 type spectrum . in the _ asca _ energy band , we should always expect the standard spectrum .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time of electrons in the magnetic field @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 where @xmath0 is the electron lorentz factor and @xmath121 is the energy density of the magnetic field .",
    "equating @xmath122 and @xmath92 gives the break energy @xmath123 above which the electron spectrum is steepened : @xmath124    thus if the maximum energy of electrons exceeds @xmath123 , we should expect a break in the electron spectrum . in particular , in the case of power - law acceleration spectrum , the loss - steepened spectrum has a power - law form @xmath125 .",
    "the average synchrotron photon energy radiated by an electron with energy of @xmath126 ( in @xmath127  ev ) in the field @xmath128 ( in @xmath129  g ) is @xmath130  kev .",
    "then , the break energy @xmath123 at which the synchrotron lifetime is balanced with the snr age is translated into the synchrotron photon energy of @xmath131 , above which noticeable spectral steepening should appear .",
    "therefore the observed flat x - ray spectrum up to 10  kev would require unrealistically small magnetic field in the hxc region , @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to show that in the case of acceleration of electrons inside hxc , independent of the strength of the magnetic field , the cut - off energy in the synchrotron spectrum can not exceed a few ev . indeed ,",
    "if the maximum energy of accelerating electrons is limited by the synchrotron losses , the balance between the acceleration and cooling timescales determines the maximum electron energy .",
    "the timescale of the first - order fermi acceleration in the bohm diffusion limit is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the larmor radius of electrons and @xmath45 is the shock velocity .",
    "equating @xmath122 in equation  ( [ eq : tau_sync ] ) and @xmath135 gives the maximum energy @xmath136  tev , and its characteristic photon energy is @xmath137  ev that is independent of the magnetic field strength .",
    "hence , regardless of the magnetic field strength , the first - order fermi acceleration mechanism can not explain the extremely flat x - ray spectrum by synchrotron radiation , unless the shock speed exceeds @xmath138 .",
    "the latter condition obviously can not be satisfied in @xmath0  cygni .",
    "the hard x - rays could be produced also by inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of seed photons off relativistic electrons . in the @xmath0  cygni snr ,",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation dominates over other ambient photon fields like the diffuse galactic infrared / optical radiation and the infrared emission from shock - heated dust @xcite .",
    "relativistic electrons which boost the cmb photons up to x - rays also emit synchrotron radiation in the radio band .",
    "characteristic energies of synchrotron photon @xmath139 and ic photon @xmath140 ( in kev ) produced by the same electrons are related as @xcite @xmath141 for the cmb seed field .",
    "the ratio of the spectral power @xmath142 of the ic x - ray emission to the synchrotron emission at the relevant radio frequency is @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the energy density of the cmb radiation .",
    "the spectral power of the observed radio emission from the whole remnant , in the frequency range from 408 mhz to 4.8 ghz @xcite is well described as @xmath145 since almost 60% of the radio flux comes from the southeast of @xmath0  cygni , from equation  ( [ eq : aak ] ) and ( [ eq : ic2syn ] ) we find that the ic spectral power can not exceed @xmath146 .",
    "this upper - limit is less than @xmath147 of the flux of the hard x - ray emission detected .",
    "thus , the ic radiation hardly can explain the flux of hxc , unless the magnetic field is extremely weak ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the nonthermal bremsstrahlung from the accelerated electrons is a natural source of the hxc flux , because the shocked dense cloudlets act as an effective target for energetic electrons . because of coulomb interactions the high density gas leads to significant hardening of low - energy electrons below the `` coulomb break '' , giving rise to the standard @xmath118 type bremsstrahlung spectrum at the x - ray band , which perfectly agrees with the _ asca _ data . the bremsstrahlung spectrum above the `` coulomb break '' essentially repeats the acceleration spectrum of electrons .",
    "for the given spectral index of accelerated electrons , the ratio of the x- and @xmath0-ray fluxes depends only on the `` coulomb break '' energy which in its turn depends on the gas density and the age of the accelerator .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nufnu ] we show the results of numerical calculations for two sets of parameters which describe the gas density and the acceleration spectrum of electrons , by assuming the electron bremsstrahlung is responsible for both the _ asca _ hard x - ray and the egret @xmath0-ray fluxes . for the electron spectrum with the acceleration index @xmath149 ,",
    "the best fit is achieved for a gas density of @xmath150 .",
    "a steeper acceleration spectrum with @xmath151 requires larger gas density , @xmath152 .",
    "note that the adopted acceleration spectra are consistent with the reported radio spectral index @xmath153 .",
    "we also suppose an exponential cutoff in the electron spectrum at 10 tev .",
    "if the electron distribution with @xmath154 extends beyond gev energies , for the magnetic field @xmath129  g the calculated radio flux density amounts to about 10%(60% ) of the measured radio flux density integrated over the whole remnant",
    ". furthermore , if the electron distribution extends beyond tev , we found the bremsstrahlung spectrum with @xmath149 exceeds the whipple upper - limit , whereas the spectral index of @xmath151 is still in agreement with the whipple data .",
    "meanwhile both combinations of model parameters satisfactorily fit the spectral shape and the absolute flux of hard x - rays .",
    "the ignorance of energy losses of electrons would lead to significantly steeper x - ray spectra , and would also result in overproduction of absolute x - ray fluxes ( dotted curves in figure  [ fig : nufnu ] ) .",
    "note that the main contribution to x - rays comes from relatively high energy electrons with energies close to 10  mev for the electron index @xmath151 .",
    "because of poor angular resolution , the egret measurements do not provide a clear information about the site(s ) of production of high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that only a part ( perhaps , even only a small part ) of the reported high energy @xmath0-ray fluxes originates in the hxc region .",
    "the @xmath0-ray fluxes could be suppressed by assuming lower gas densities .",
    "indeed , such an assumption would lead to the shift of the `` coulomb break '' energy in the electron spectrum to lower energies , and the predicted high energy @xmath0-ray spectra would appear significantly below the reported egret fluxes ( a solid curve in figure  [ fig : nufnu ] ) .",
    "a more likely candidate for production of the bulk of high energy @xmath0-rays is the region called dr4 from which most of the radio emission emerges .",
    "a massive cloud with a density of @xmath155  @xmath57 occupying @xmath156% of the snr volume has been suggested to exist in the vicinity of dr4 to explain the @xmath0-ray flux @xcite .",
    "actually the egret error circle reported is somewhat away from the hxc but closer to the dr4 .",
    "a density of @xmath155  @xmath57 is higher than the upper limit density of the hxc .",
    "such high gas density implies a high ( about 50 mev ) `` coulomb break '' energy in the electron spectrum , and therefore considerable suppression of x - ray flux .",
    "this could naturally explain the lack of noticeable hard x - ray fluxes from the dr4 region which is bright in radio and possibly @xmath0-rays .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the power consumption due to the rapid coulomb losses . for the gas density of about @xmath157 in the hxc ,",
    "the x - ray flux is produced predominantly by electrons with energies of about 10  mev .",
    "the x - ray flux is roughly proportional to the product of the gas density and the number of relativistic electrons , because the relativistic bremsstrahlung cross - section depends only logarithmically on the electron energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the coulomb energy loss rate of relativistic electrons , @xmath158 , is proportional to the gas density and almost independent of the electron energy .",
    "therefore the energy loss rate of the bulk of the x - ray emitting electrons can be uniquely determined by the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the measured x - ray luminosity , @xmath66 , can be converted to the energy loss rate of @xmath159 .",
    "the energy released in relativistic electrons is roughly estimated as @xmath160  ergs .",
    "this enormous energy deposition due to coulomb collisions would heat the emission region of the hxc .",
    "subsequently the heat would be radiated away in the far - infrared band by molecular line emission , if the gas is comprised of molecules .",
    "the observed infrared luminosity of @xmath0  cygni @xcite is comparable to the energy loss rate estimated above .",
    "on the other hand , if the emission region of the hxc are predominantly shock - ionized plasmas , the deposited energies by the accelerated electrons would heat up the plasmas .",
    "the x - ray emissions emerging from the @xmath0  cygni snr are found to be complex .",
    "spatial and spectral studies of the x - ray data reveal the presence of four components : ( 1 ) limb - brightened thermal emission with a temperature of @xmath161  kev ; ( 2 ) widespread emission with a temperature of @xmath162  kev aligned from north to southeast bounded by the radio - bright regions ; ( 3 ) strong emission lines from ions in the vicinity of the northern bright - radio region ; ( 4 ) clumpy hard emissions , which is best described by unusually hard power - law spectral distribution with a photon index @xmath2 0.81.5 .",
    "the limb - brightened component is considered to be thermal plasma emission from the immediate postshock region of the snr blast wave that is propagating through the interstellar medium .",
    "the temperature gives the age estimate of @xmath163  yr based on the sedov evolution of the remnant .",
    "the soft x - ray emissions from north to southeast are likely to be caused by the interaction between the supernova shock and the cavity wall comprised of ambient clouds . in particular , the intense neon line emission would be attributable to the low - temperature plasma generated by the shock  cloud interaction .    the extremely hard x - ray emission of the hxc is naturally explained by the nonthermal bremsstrahlung from the loss - flattened electron distribution . by assuming that the hxc is a counterpart of the egret unidentified @xmath0-ray source 3eg  j2020",
    "+ 4017 , we estimate the density of the emission region to be @xmath164  @xmath57 , for the electron index 2.3 .",
    "the bremsstrahlung interpretation requires very large coulomb energy loss rate of @xmath165 and consequently the total amount of the energy loss of @xmath166  ergs , regardless of the gas density and the energy of electrons responsible for the hard x - radiation .",
    "given the limited energy budget of @xmath0 cygni , it is more comfortable to attribute this huge energy release to the acceleration at the hxc region , rather than to assume that the electrons are supplied by external accelerators .",
    "otherwise , the energy requirement would be increased by an order - of - magnitude or more , unless we assume very specific arrangement of external accelerators around the hxc region .",
    "if the hxc region contributes only a fraction of the egret high energy @xmath0-ray flux , the gas density estimate of 130  @xmath57 should be considered as an upper limit .",
    "all accelerated electrons are presumed to be trapped inside the hxc volume . however , it may be possible that high - energy ( @xmath167 mev ) electrons effectively escape from the hxc , and later interact with very dense clouds resulting in high energy @xmath0-rays and synchrotron radio emission , but without noticeable x - radiation",
    ". the spatial structures of the hxc will be comprehensively studied by our forthcoming _",
    "chandra _ observation .",
    "the origin of the @xmath0-ray emission from @xmath0  cygni will eventually be tested by the future _ gamma - ray large area space telescope _ ( _ glast _ ) mission .",

    "drury for his critical comment concerning the interpretation of the site of electron acceleration .",
