    "having reached this stage , the largest identifiable objects that will ever populate our universe may be the ones that we observe in the process of formation at the present cosmological time .",

    ".    while clusters of galaxies are the most massive and most recently collapsed and virialized structures , the present - day superclusters are arguably the largest bound but not yet fully evolved objects in our universe . in our accelerating universe , we may assume they are the objects that ultimately will turn into island universes .",

    "these superclusters , the largest structures identifiable in the present universe , are enormous structures comprising a few up to dozens of rich clusters of galaxies , a large number of more modestly sized clumps , and thousands of galaxies spread between these density concentrations .    in this study , we aim at contrasting the large - scale evolution of structure in an accelerated universe with that of the internal evolution of bound objects . in order to infer what will be the largest bound regions in our universe , the _ island universes _ , we study the mass function of bound objects .",
    "the abundance or mass function of superclusters serves as a good indicator of the growth of structure of a cosmological model .",

    "the present study is based on a physical criterion for the definition of superclusters proposed by @xcite , namely that they are the largest bound ( though not yet virialized ) structures in the universe .",
    "the practical implementation of this definition suggested in that paper is through an ( approximate ) density threshold for regions that are gravitationally bound .",
    "given the anisotropic nature of the collapse and the tidal influence of the cosmic surroundings @xcite this may only yield a rough approximation .",
    "the work by @xcite did show that a density threshold does depend on shape and environment .",
    "one could imagine a variety of alternative physical definitions for superclusters , also relating to the assumption that they are the largest bound structures in the universe which just have commenced to condense out of the cosmic background .",
    "one particular criterion would be to invoke the corresponding velocity field and identify them with bound regions that have turned around and started to contract , on the way towards complete collapse and virialization .",
    "here we follow @xcite and assume that a global density threshold criterion , in combination with a few extra assumptions , assures a reasonably accurate identification process .",

    "* ) . in the observational reality of our local universe ( @xmath209 )",
    ", we find 5 superclusters with 10 or more members , the largest one containing 12 members ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this brings us to the issue of the extent to which the supercluster population in our lcdm simulation at @xmath5 resembles the one seen in our nearby universe . to this end",
    "we are in the process of translating our theoretical supercluster criterion into one that would be able to identify structures along the same lines in large magnitude - limited galaxy redshift surveys . by applying this to the 6df galaxy sample @xcite and the sdss dr7 galaxy sample @xcite",

    "first indications from similar comparison between superclusters in the 2dfgrs sample @xcite and the millennium simulation @xcite , based on a more conventional supercluster identification process , seems to indicate that there are no discernable discrepancies @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have followed the evolution of bound objects from the present epoch up to a time in the far future of the universe , at @xmath1 , in a standard @xmath0cdm ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath81 ) universe .",
    "we contrasted the external global evolution of the population of bound objects with their vigorous internal evolution , starting from the contention that in a dark energy dominated universe they have the character of _ island universes_. within such a universe we expect them to become increasingly isolated objects in which cosmic evolution proceeds to the ultimate equilibrium configuration of a smooth , spherical , virialized and highly concentrated mass clumps .",
    "we identify the most massive of these objects with superclusters .    for the external evolution ,",
    "we investigate the spatial distribution and clustering of bound objects and superclusters , along with the weak change of their mass functions . to assess the internal structure , we have looked into their rapidly changing shape , their evolving density profile and mass concentration and the level of substructure of the superclusters in terms of their multiplicity , i.e. the number of clusters within their realm .",
    "we defined the bound structures by the density criterion derived in paper i ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] ) , and identified them from a 500@xmath85 mpc cosmological box with @xmath214 dark matter particles in a @xmath0cdm ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath81 ) universe .",
    "we ran the simulation up to @xmath1 , which is a time where structures have stopped forming .",
    "we used the hop halo identifier in order to identify independently virialized structures , at each of the five timesteps we have analyzed in detail : @xmath5 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 100 .",
    "the main results of the present study can be summarized as follows :    * while the large - scale evolution of bound objects and superclusters comes to a halt as a result of the cosmic acceleration , their internal evolution continues vigorously until they have evolved into single , isolated , almost perfectly spherical , highly concentrated , virialized mass clumps .",
    "this development is very strong between @xmath5 and 10 , and continues up to @xmath1 . *",
    "the marginally bound objects that we study resemble the superclusters in the observed universe . while clusters of galaxies are the most massive , fully collapsed and virialized objects in the universe , superclusters are the largest bound but not yet collapsed structures in the universe .",
    "* the superclusters are true _ island universes _ : as a result of the accelerating expansion of the universe , no other , more massive and larger , structures will be able to form .",
    "* while the superclusters collapse between @xmath5 and @xmath1 , their surroundings change radically .",
    "while at the present epoch they are solidly embedded within the cosmic web , by @xmath1 they have turned into isolated cosmic islands .",
    "* the large scale distribution of bound objects and superclusters ( in comoving space ) does not show any significant evolution in between @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "the cluster and supercluster correlation functions do not change over this time interval , and retain their near power - law behaviour .",
    "superclusters remain significantly stronger clustered than the average bound object , with a supercluster correlation length of @xmath215mpc compared to @xmath216mpc for the full bound object distribution in our simulation sample .",
    "* the mass functions of bound objects and superclusters hardly change from @xmath5 to @xmath1 , as we expect on theoretical grounds .",
    "the mass functions in the simulations are generally in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of he press - schechter , sheth - tormen , and jenkins mass functions . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the sheth - tormen prescription provides a better fit . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the pure press - schechter function seems to be marginally better .",
    "this may tie in with the more anisotropic shape of superclusters at @xmath5 in comparison to their peers at @xmath1 . *",
    "the change in the internal mass distribution and that in the surroundings is directly reflected by the radial density profile . without exception towards @xmath1 all objects attain a highly concentrated internal matter distribution , with a concentration index @xmath217 .",
    "in general , the vast majority of objects has evolved into a highly concentrated mass clump after @xmath95 . * the mass profile in the outer realms of the supercluster changes radically from @xmath5 to @xmath1 . at @xmath5",
    "it is rather irregular , while there are large differences between the individual objects .",
    "this is a reflection of the surrounding inhomogeneous mass distribution of the cosmic web . in between @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "nearly all superclusters have developed a smooth , regular and steadily declining mass profile . *",
    "the inner density profile steepens substantially when the inner region of the supercluster is still contracting . on the other hand ,",
    "when at @xmath5 it has already developed a substantial virialized core , the inner density profile hardly changes . * as a result of their collapse , the shapes of the bound objects systematically change from the original triaxial shape at @xmath5 into an almost perfectly spherical configuration at @xmath1 . for example , at @xmath5 their mean axis ratios are ( @xmath163 , @xmath218)= ( 0.69,0.48 ) . at @xmath1 , they have mean axis ratios of ( @xmath163,@xmath218)= ( 0.94,0.85 ) .",
    "* at the current epoch the superclusters still contain a substantial amount of substructure .",
    "particularly interesting is the amount of cluster - mass virialized objects within its realm , expressed in the so called _",
    "multiplicity function_. restricting ourselves to superclusters with a mass larger than @xmath219m@xmath3 , of which we have 17 in our simulation sample , we find a multiplicity of 5 to 15 at the current epoch . as time proceeds there is a systematic evolution towards unit multiplicity at @xmath1 , following the accretion and merging of all clusters within the supercluster s realms . * in a volume comparable to the local universe ( @xmath209 ) we find that the most massive supercluster would have a mass of @xmath220m@xmath3 .",
    "this is slightly more massive than the mass of the shapley supercluster given in @xcite . when turning towards the multiplicity , we find that the largest superclusters in the local universe would host between 10 and 15 members , close to the number found in the bound region of the shapley supercluster @xcite ( which contains @xmath213 of the clusters traditionally assigned to this structure , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while in this study we have addressed a large number of issues , our study leaves many related studies for further investigation .",
    "one of the most pressing issues concerns an assessment of the nature of our supercluster objects .",
    "this involves a comparison with other supercluster definitions , in particular in how far our density - based definition fares at the earlier epochs when most objects of similar mass will have distinct anisotropic shapes .",
    "also , while here we follow the evolution of superclusters in the standard @xmath0cdm universe , in an accompanying publication we will systematically address the influence of dark matter and dark energy on the emerging supercluster .",
    "there we found that dark matter is totally dominant in determining the supercluster s evolution .",
