    "* dangelo & spruit  ( 2010 ) ) . for the numerical calculations of the rldp , i included the effect of additional spin - down torques , acting on the neutron star , due to both magnetic field drag on the accretion disk ( * ? ? ? * ( rapapport  et  al .",
    "2004 ) ) as well as magnetic dipole radiation , although these effects are usually not dominant .",
    "the total spin torque can be written as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a dimensionless function , depending on the fastness parameter , @xmath11 , which is introduced to model a gradual torque change in a transition zone near the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "the rapidly decreasing mass - transfer rate during the rldp results in an expanding magnetosphere which causes a significant braking torque to act on the spinning pulsar .",
    "thus it forces the rotational period to increase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . at some point",
    "the spin equilibrium is broken .",
    "initially , the spin can remain in equilibrium by adapting to the decreasing value of @xmath5 . further into the rldp ,",
    "however , @xmath6 increases on a timescale faster than the spin - relaxation timescale , @xmath12 at which the torque can transmit the effect of deceleration to the neutron star and therefore @xmath13 , leading to @xmath14 at all times onwards .",
    "the results is that axmsps in lmxbs typically lose @xmath15  % of their rotational energy ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , depending on the b - field of the pulsar , the duration of the rldp and the assumptions governing the disk - magnetosphere interactions .",
    "to estimate the spin - relaxation timescale one can simply consider : @xmath16 : @xmath17 in intermediate - mass x - ray binaries ( imxbs ) the mass - transfer phase from a more massive companion is relatively short , causing the rldp  effect to be negligible .",
    "the reason for the major difference between the rldp  effect in lmxbs ( often leading to the formation of radio msps with helium white dwarf companions ) and imxbs ( primarily leading to mildly recycled pulsars with carbon - oxygen / oxygen - neon magnesium white dwarfs ) is the time duration of the rldp relative to the spin - relaxation timescale , i.e. the ratio of @xmath18 . in lmxbs , @xmath19 .",
    "however , in imxbs this ratio is often smaller by a factor of 10 which causes the spin period to `` freeze '' at the original value of @xmath20 , see ( * ? ? ? * tauris  et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) for further details and examples of model calculations ) .",
    "the rldp  effect discussed here can explain why the recycled radio msps ( observed _ after _ the rldp ) are significantly slower rotators compared to the more rapidly spinning axmsps ( observed _ before _ the rldp ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . only for radio msps with @xmath21",
    "can the difference in spin periods be partly understood from regular magnetic dipole and plasma current spin - down over a radio msp lifetime of several gyr .",
    "when comparing radio msps and axmsps one should be aware of differences in their binary properties and observational biases , see som in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tauris  ( 2012 ) ) .",
    "observationally , the rldp  effect can be verified if future surveys discover a significant number of axmsps and radio msps confined to an interval with similar orbital periods and companion star masses .",
    "although axmsps are believed to be progenitors of radio msps , all of the 14 observed axmsps have orbital periods less than one day whereas fully recycled radio msps are observed with orbital periods all the way up to a few hundred days .",
    "this is a puzzle .",
