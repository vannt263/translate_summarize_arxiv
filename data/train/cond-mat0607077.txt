    "in this paper , we address the charge transfer through the interface between a superconductor ( sc ) and a hopping insulator ( hi ) , i.e. , a system where transport occurs via hops between localized ( _ non - propagating _ ) single particle states .",
    "there are many experimental situations in which the hopping insulator is coupled to a measuring circuit via superconducting leads , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "however , it has long been known that transport of single electrons into or out of a superconductor is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures as @xmath1 , due to the energy gap , @xmath2 , of the superconductor.@xcite consequently , single - electron tunneling can not be responsible for the charge transfer between a superconductor and any normal conductor .",
    "the problem of charge transfer between a sc and a hi was first addressed in ref .  , where it was shown that at low temperatures the transport is governed by the _ time - reversal reflection _ , where electrons tunnel into superconductor from the localized states in the hopping insulator located near the interface .",
    "this process is similar to so - called _ crossed _ andreev charge transfer discussed previously in connection with various mesoscopic systems.@xcite electrons hopping from the superconductor to impurities near the surface of the insulator and back again have been proposed as a source of qubit decoherence for some systems.@xcite    in this paper we extend the analysis of ref .   in two directions .",
    "_ firstly _ , we consider the influence of the properties of the tunneling barrier on the charge transfer , which turns out to be surprisingly sensitive to the barrier roughness .",
    "namely , we found that interference effects in tunneling can lead to a significant _ increase _ in the interface resistance due to fine cancellations of the contributions to the two - particle tunneling probability .",
    "the roughness of the barrier suppresses these effects and in this way influences the interface resistance .",
    "_ secondly _ , we consider _ non - ohmic _ transport through the interface .",
    "we will show that the interface contribution to the resistance can be strongly nonlinear , and that the nonlinear behavior is essentially related to the coulomb correlation of the occupation numbers of the localized states adjacent to the interface .",
    "one can expect a rich pattern of reproducible ( fingerprint ) fluctuations in the @xmath0-curve due to pronounced non - ohmic contributions of individual pairs .",
    "thus , combined studies of the linear interface resistance and average nonlinear @xmath0 curve and its fluctuations may tell a lot about barrier details and about the formation of the depletion zone near the barrier .",

    "[ nonlinearconductance ] , starting from calculation of the non - ohmic contributions of the individual pairs , we demonstrate how account of the coulomb correlations leads to non - ohmic behavior of the interface conductance .",
    "as shown in ref .  , the contact resistance can be governed either by the interface tunneling barrier , or by deformation of the hopping cluster in the hi in the vicinity of the interface . here , for brevity",
    ", we will focus on the situation where the interface resistance is dominated by the barrier .",

    "the matsubara formalism , see e.g. ref .  , allows calculation of the susceptibility by analytical continuation of the so - called _ matsubara susceptibility _ defined as @xmath15 here @xmath16 means ordering in `` imaginary time '' , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , temperature @xmath19 is measured in units of energy .",

    ", the partition function can be written as @xmath206 and the probabilities of the different configurations in similar notation : @xmath207 here @xmath20 is the chemical potential in the superconductor .    the current through the interface is proportional to the difference @xmath208 with the inclusion of the coulomb energy this can no longer be factorized into separate occupation probabilities of the two impurities of the pair , but if we set @xmath209 , it can be seen that the difference simplifies to the former results .",
    "if we consider the pairs inside the depletion zone , we use @xmath210 . taking into account the energy conservation law requiring @xmath211",
    "one can express the difference @xmath212 as @xmath213 in this case , the energy conservation law is independent of @xmath193 , so the transitions are suppressed until the voltage reaches @xmath214 , then it rapidly rises , before @xmath212 saturates at unity . for the pairs outside the depletion zone , we can write @xmath215 and the expression for @xmath212 is @xmath216 while these expressions are somewhat similar , the main difference lies in the @xmath193-dependence of the conservation law which means that as the voltage changes , the choice of pairs satisfying energy conservation will change , so a single pair will pass into and out of the allowed range instead of saturating .    in the following we assume the fermi level in a semiconductor to located inside the impurity band , which is sufficiently larger than @xmath217 .",
    "therefore when performing the summation over all pairs , we choose a uniform distribution of @xmath52 . in this case",
    ", both expressions will give exactly the same results , although the physics behind them are slightly different . neglecting the coulomb interaction between the components of the pair , we simply get a linear relation in both cases .",
    "thus ohmic behavior would persist even though @xmath193 can exceed the temperature @xmath19 . for pairs inside the depletion zone , this is due to inclusion and saturation of more pairs as @xmath193 becomes larger than the energy splitting of the pairs .",
    "if a given pair has started contributing , one channel has been opened , it will not terminate with increasing @xmath193 . outside the depletion zone , pairs will only contribute for the width of the @xmath49-function , so as voltage rises , other pairs will take over the transport , but the number of pairs that can contribute will rise linearly with the voltage .",
    "a typical @xmath0-curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivcurve ] .",
    "this curve is calculated under a simplifying assumption that the coulomb correlation energy @xmath194 is kept constant of the same order as the temperature @xmath19 since the contribution of the @xmath218 pair is @xmath219 and cut - off at small @xmath220 by the requirements @xmath221 .",
    "@xcite for this pairs the coulomb interaction is essentially screened and does not block two - electron tunneling .",
    "this assumption significantly simplified the calculation comparing with averaging over all correlation energies , but does not change the conclusion . as we see",
    ", the transport is suppressed at @xmath222,while for @xmath223 transport will return to a ohmic behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivcurve ] .    , 1 , and 2 .",
    "[ fig : ivcurve],width=302 ]    thus we predict a rather unusual situation when the conductance evolves for a low - field ohmic to a high - field ohmic regime through an intermediate non - ohmic one .",
    "such behavior is a hallmark of the coulomb correlation between the occupation numbers of the pairs responsible for crossed andreev reflections .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the pair tunneling through a barrier at the interface between a superconductor and hopping insulator is extremely sensitive to the properties of the tunneling barrier .",
    "this sensitivity is due to rapid oscillations ( at scale @xmath224 ) of the electron wave functions in a superconductor comparing to the characteristic scale , @xmath53 , of variation of the localized wave function in a hopping insulator .",
    "these oscillations cause dramatic cancellations in the tunneling probability if the barrier is uniform . however , this cancellation of the interference origin can be suppressed if the barrier is inhomogeneous , as it was demonstrated for different models of a barrier . in particular",
    ", the fluctuations in the barrier strength of the scale @xmath151 falling within the window @xmath225 suppress the cancellations and restore the transport even if their relative amplitude @xmath187 is very small .",
    "for a barrier with a block - like disorder with the scale @xmath226 we obtained an estimate for suppression of the oscillations @xmath227 for the pairs located at the distance @xmath226 from the interface .",
    "this happens if the beneficial barrier fluctuations must coincide with particularly positioned impurities with the right energies , means that the number of impurities contributing to conductance will be relatively small and the relative importance of `` successful '' pairs will increase .",
    "consequently , one can expect pronounced mesoscopic - sample specific and reproducible - fluctuations in both ohmic and non - ohmic conductance .",
    "such fluctuations will be especially pronounced when the barrier contains large transparency fluctuations ( punctures ) .",
    "one can expect that the fluctuations will have different behavior depending on the location of the relevant pairs with respect to the position of the depletion zone near the interface .",
    "we plan to study mesoscopic fluctuations of the andreev transport between a superconductor and a hopping insulator in more detail as a separate project .",
    "another specific feature of the transport is sensitivity of the non - ohmic transport to coulomb correlation in the occupation numbers of the relevant pairs .",
    "this correlation leads to non - ohmic behavior at _ low _ voltages , @xmath228 , while at higher voltages the transport turns out to be ohmic .",
    "this re - entrant behavior is a hallmark of the coulomb correlation .",
