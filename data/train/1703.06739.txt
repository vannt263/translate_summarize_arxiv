    "in physics , the study of colloidal brownian motion has a long history beginning with einstein s famous paper  @xcite in 1905 , and the understanding of its mechanism has been systematically developed in molecular kinetic theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental developments have enabled researchers to observe a single trajectory itself of brownian motion  @xcite , which engages physicists in quantitative modelling of sub - micrometer systems , such as molecular motors  @xcite .",
    "likewise , recent breakthroughs for computational technologies have enabled physicists to study microstructure of financial brownian motion in detail .",
    "they have applied their knowledge beyond material science and into studying in particular price movements in financial markets for about a quarter century . there",
    "consequently appeared new approaches as mentioned below , in contrast to conventional mathematical finance where a priori theoretical dynamics is assumed  @xcite .",
    "there are three physical approaches to financial brownian motions as shown in figure  [ fig : micro - meso - macro ] .",
    "the microscopic approach focuses on the dynamics of traders in the financial markets ( figure  [ fig : micro - meso - macro]a ) .",
    "traders correspond to molecules in the modelling of materials , which enables both a numerical and a theoretical analysis of the macroscopic motion of prices  @xcite .",
    "another approach is based on macroscopic empirical analyses of price time series ( figure  [ fig : micro - meso - macro]c ) and the direct empirical modelling of price dynamics focusing on fat - tailed distributions and long - time correlations in volatility  @xcite .",
    "the third approach focuses on mesoscopic dynamics concerning order - books ( figure  [ fig : micro - meso - macro]b ) , which are accumulated buy  sell orders initiated by traders in the price axis where deals occur either at the best bid ( buy ) or ask ( sell ) price defining the market prices",
    ". numerical simulations of markets become available by introducing models of order - book dynamics  @xcite .",
    "recently , the mesoscopic approach developed considerably with the analysis of high frequency financial market data in which the whole history of orders is tractable using a direct analogy between order - books and colloids  @xcite . from the order - book data",
    "@xcite , the importance of inertia was reported for market price , implying the existence of market trends . the langevin equation was then found to hold most of time showing that the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation relation can be extended to order - book dynamics .",
    "however , microscopic mechanisms behind market trends have not been clarified so far because direct information is required on individual traders strategies . in the present paper , we analyse more informative order - book data in which traders can be identified in an anonymised way for each order so that we can estimate each trader s dynamics directly from the data .    here",
    "we present a minimal model validated by direct observation of individual traders trajectories for financial brownian motion .",
    "we first report a novel statistical law on the trend - following behaviour of foreign exchange ( fx ) traders by tracking the trajectories of all individuals .",
    "we next introduce a corresponding microscopic model incorporated with the empirical law .",
    "we reveal the mesoscopic and macroscopic behaviour of our model by developing a parallel theory to that for molecular kinetics : boltzmann - like and langevin - like equations are derived for the order - book and the price dynamics , respectively . a quantitative agreement with empirical findings",
    "is finally presented without further assumptions .",
    "we analysed the high - frequency fx data between the us dollar ( usd ) and the japanese yen ( jpy ) from the 5th 16.00 to the 10th 20.00 gmt september 2016 on electronic broking services , one of the biggest fx platforms in the world .",
    "all trader activities were recorded for our dataset with anonymised trader ids with one - millisecond time - precision .",
    "the minimum price - precision was 0.005 yen for the usd / jpy pair at that time , and the currency unit in this paper is 0.001 yen , called the tenth pip ( tpip ) .",
    "the minimum volume unit for transaction was one million usd , and the total monetary flow was about @xmath0 billion usd during this week .",
    "the market adopts the double - auction system , where traders quote bid or ask prices . in this paper , we particularly focused on the dynamics of high - frequency traders ( hfts ) , who frequently submit or cancel orders according to algorithms ( see appendix  [ app : def_hft ] for the definition ) .",
    "the presence of hfts has rapidly grown recently  @xcite and @xmath1 of the total orders were submitted by the hfts in our dataset .",
    "we first illustrate the trajectories of bid and ask prices quoted for the top 3 hfts in figure .",
    "[ fig : trajectory_traders]a  c .",
    "we observed that with the two - sided quotes typical hfts tend to play the role of liquidity providers ( called market - makers  @xcite ) .",
    "we also observed that buy  sell spreads ( i.e. , the difference between the bid and ask prices for a single market - maker ) fluctuated around certain time - constants , showing a strong coupling between these prices .",
    "indeed , the buy  sell spread distributions exhibit sharp peaks for individual hfts as shown in the insets in figure  [ fig : trajectory_traders]a  c ( see also appendix  [ app : buy - sell ] ) .",
    "we next report the empirical microscopic law for the trend - following strategy of individual traders .",
    "let us denote the bid and ask prices of the top @xmath2th hft by @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see appendix  [ app : trend - following ] for the definitions ) .",
    "we investigated the average movement of the mid - price @xmath5 between transactions conditional on the previous market price movement @xmath6 ( figure  [ fig : trend_follow]a ) . for the top 20 hfts ( figure  [ fig : trend_follow]b and c ) ,",
    "we find that the average movement is described by @xmath7 where the conditional average @xmath8 is taken when the previous price movement is @xmath6 and @xmath9 ( see appendix  [ app : trend - following ] for the detail ) . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constants characterizing the price movement and the saturation threshold against the market trend . here",
    ", typical values are given using @xmath12 [ tpip ] and @xmath13 [ tpip ] .",
    "the empirical law  ( [ eq : trendfollow ] ) implies that the reaction of traders is linear for small market trends but saturates for large market trends .",
    "remarkably , a similar behaviour was reported from a full macroscopic analysis of market price data at one - month precision  @xcite .",
    "here we introduce a minimal microscopic model incorporating the empirical law  ( [ eq : trendfollow ] ) .",
    "we make four assumptions : ( i )  the number of traders is sufficiently large .",
    "( ii )  they always quote both bid and ask prices ( for the @xmath2th trader , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) simultaneously with a unit volume as market - makers .",
    "( iii )  buy  sell spreads are time - constants unique to traders with distribution @xmath14 .",
    "the trader dynamics is then characterized by the mid - price @xmath15 .",
    "( iv )  trend - following random walks are assumed in the microscopic dynamics ( see figure  [ fig : dealermodel]a  c ) : @xmath16 with a constant strength for trend - following @xmath17 , white gaussian noise @xmath18 with constant variance @xmath19 , and a requotation jump @xmath20 after transactions ( figure  [ fig : dealermodel]c ) .",
    "@xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 with jump size @xmath22 and the @xmath23th transaction time @xmath24 between traders @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "the transaction condition at time @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 ( figure  [ fig : dealermodel]b ) .",
    "this model can be assessed using parallel tools employed in molecular kinetic theory . in this theory",
    "@xcite , the boltzmann equation is first derived for the one - body velocity distribution from the hamiltonian dynamics by the method of bogoliubov , born , green , kirkwood , and yvon assuming molecular chaos .",
    "the langevin equation is derived in turn from the boltzmann equation for massive brownian particles  @xcite .",
    "here we have followed the same mathematical procedure to elucidate the dynamics behind order - book profiles and financial brownian motion . for relative position @xmath28 from the centre of mass @xmath29 ,",
    "the boltzmann - like equation is first derived for the one - body probability distribution density @xmath30 conditional for a trader with a buy  sell spread @xmath31 from the multi - agent dynamics  ( [ eq : dealermodel ] ) : @xmath32\\label{eq : financialboltzmann}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . here , @xmath35",
    "( @xmath36 ) represents transactions as bid ( ask ) orders .",
    "the average order - book profile is given by @xmath37 for the ask side .",
    "the integral term in equation  ( [ eq : financialboltzmann ] ) corresponds to the collision integral in the conventional boltzmann equation .",
    "as the langevin equation is derived from it  @xcite , then similarly the langevin - like equation is derived from the boltzmann - like equation  ( [ eq : financialboltzmann ] ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the market price movement and transaction time interval at the @xmath41th tick time .",
    "the tick time is an integer time incremented by every transaction and the mean time interval between transactions is @xmath42 seconds in this week .",
    "the first and second terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : financiallangevin ] ) describe trend - following and random noise , respectively ; the trend - following term corresponds to the momentum inertia in the conventional langevin equation .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : financialboltzmann ] ) and  ( [ eq : financiallangevin ] ) can be solved for @xmath43 under an appropriate boundary condition ( see appendix  [ app : boundaryconditions ] ) .",
    "we first set the buy  sell spread distribution as @xmath44 with decay length @xmath45}$ ] , empirically validated in our dataset ( figure  [ fig : pricediff]a and appendix  [ app : buy - sell ] ) .",
    "the average order - book profile @xmath46 is given for @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{eq : orderbook}\\ ] ] the tail of the price movement is approximately given by @xmath49 with decay length @xmath50 , average movement from trend - following @xmath51 , average transaction interval @xmath52 , and complementary cumulative distribution @xmath53 .",
    "further technical details are to be published in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we next investigated the consistency between our microscopic model and our dataset .",
    "the empirical daily profile was first studied for the average order - book @xmath46 in figure  [ fig : pricediff]b ( see appendix  [ app : order - book ] for the detail ) .",
    "surprisingly , we found an agreement with our theoretical lines  ( [ eq : orderbook ] ) without fitting parameter that strongly supports the validity of our description .",
    "we also empirically evaluated the two - hourly segmented cumulative distribution for the price movement in one - tick precision @xmath54 ( figure  [ fig : pricediff]c ) , which obeys an exponential law that is consistent with our theoretical prediction  ( [ eq : theory_pricemove ] ) . in our dataset ,",
    "the decay length @xmath55 is approximately constant over a two - hour period but varies over time during the week .",
    "to remove this non - stationary feature , we introduced the two - hourly scaled cumulative distribution @xmath56 with scaling parameters @xmath55 and @xmath57 ( figure  [ fig : pricediff]d ) , thereby incorporating the two - hourly exponential - law for the whole week .",
    "the price movements obey an exponential law for short periods but simultaneously obeys a power - law over long periods with exponent @xmath58 ( figure  [ fig : pricediff]e ) .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is explained by the power - law nature of the decay length @xmath55 . because @xmath55 approximately obeys a power - law cumulative distribution @xmath59 over the week with @xmath60 ( figure  [ fig : pricediff]f ) , the one - week distribution @xmath61 obeys the power - law as a superposition of the two - hourly segmented exponential distribution , @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "remarkably , @xmath55 tends to be long when the market is inactive ( figure  [ fig : pricediff]g ) .",
    "we therefore obtain a consistent result with the previously reported power - law  @xcite as a non - stationary property of @xmath55 .",
    "we note that our model can exhibit super - diffusion under an appropriate parameter set as @xmath64 with @xmath65 for short periods ( figure  [ fig : pricediff]h ) , which is consistent with previous reports  @xcite . here",
    "the mean squared displacement is defined by @xmath66 as a function of tick time @xmath41 with the ensemble average @xmath67 .",
    "we also note that our model asymptotically shows ballistic behaviour @xmath68 when trend - following is sufficiently large , which implies that it plays the role of a  momentum inertia \" in financial markets .",
    "we further note that our model can show sub - diffusion ( @xmath69 ) when trend - following is sufficiently small .",
    "in this article , we have presented an intensive data analysis of anonymised traders in a foreign exchange market to directly observe strategies of hfts .",
    "we first report a simple empirical law characterizing trend - following behaviour of individual traders against market trends .",
    "a trend - following random walk model is correspondingly introduced as a microscopic dynamics of the financial market .",
    "the mesoscopic and macroscopic behaviours of this model are systematically analysed in a parallel calculation to molecular kinetic theory .",
    "our theoretical model reproduces the average order - book profile and the price movement distributions empirically .",
    "this work would be an important step toward unified description of financial markets from individual traders dynamics .",
    "we discuss here a possible reason behind the success of our kinetic - like theory for our model . in material physics ,",
    "mean - field approximations are invalid for low - dimensional systems because the low - dimensional geometry does not allow two - body correlations to disappear after collision .",
    "in contrast , in our model , traders are separated compulsorily after transactions , and there is little possibility for the same pair to enter successive transactions .",
    "the two - body correlation then quickly decays after collision assuming  molecular chaos \" is valid .",
    "this scenario implies that the kinetic - like description may work well in various socio - economic systems , in addition to the previously studied examples , such as opinion formation and wealth distribution  @xcite .",
    "our report dealt mainly with short - duration trends ; their correlation with long - duration trends  @xcite is a topic to future studies .",
    "of interest is the study of traders behaviour in unstable markets triggered by external shocks , as those that occur in financial crises and flash crashes .",
    "the economics reason behind the hyperbolicity  ( [ eq : trendfollow ] ) in trend - following needs to be pursed further .",
