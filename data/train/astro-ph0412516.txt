    "it is well known that galaxies of different types are not identically distributed within galaxy groups ( manifested in the well - known phenomenon of morphological segregation , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "red , typically elliptical galaxies , with low star - formation rates are preferentially found towards the centres of large groups , while blue , actively star - forming galaxies dominate in the outskirts of groups and in the field .",
    "furthermore , measurements of the galaxy - galaxy two - point correlation function have shown that it is well fitted by a power - law over a wide range of distance scales ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and that the slope of this power - law is a function of galaxy spectral type or colour ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) : blue galaxies have a shallower two - point correlation function than the red galaxies .",
    "the correlation function of the dark matter , on the other hand , has a lower amplitude and is far from being a featureless power - law , thus the galaxy distribution is said to be _ biased _ with respect to the dark matter .",
    "much recent progress towards understanding the nature of galaxy biasing has come through use of the halo model of large scale structure .",
    "the model has its origins in the work of @xcite , and was first applied to continuous density fields by @xcite .",
    "it has been recently used in the context of the clustering of both dark matter and galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "provide a detailed review . in the model , matter in the universe",
    "is assumed to reside only in discrete haloes .",
    "the distribution of the matter within the haloes gives rise to the non - linear component of the power spectrum , while the large - scale distribution of the haloes in space is responsible for the power on linear scales .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows analytic calculations of correlation functions to be made , so that large parameter spaces can be investigated at relatively little cost when compared to numerical simulations of the large scale structure .",
    "two ingredients are required to extend the model to galaxy clustering : the probability distribution for the number of galaxies hosted by a particular halo , @xmath3 , known as the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , and the spatial distribution of galaxies within haloes .",
    "the distribution of the galaxies within haloes is commonly assumed , ad hoc , to be the same as that of the dark matter ; differences in the clustering properties are then solely due to the choice of halo occupation distribution .",
    "we do not rely on this assumption in our analysis below , but instead obtain the actual galaxy group radial density distributions observationally .",
    "this allows us to confirm , for observed hods and radial profiles , the findings of @xcite , who used hods drawn from semi - analytic models to demonstrate the dominance of the hod over the intra - halo distribution in the correlation function .",
    "previous studies have assumed the validity of the halo model , and used the observed galaxy correlation functions to constrain the halo occupation distribution , or the radial distribution of galaxies in haloes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , we take as empirical an approach as possible .",
    "we directly measure the radial and halo occupation distributions of galaxies in the 2dfgrs percolation - inferred galaxy group ( 2pigg ) catalogue @xcite , focusing in particular on the separate distributions of red and blue galaxies .",
    "having measured these distributions , no free parameters remain in the model . since the correlation functions of these populations have previously been directly obtained ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the non - trivial success of the halo model in reproducing the observed clustering statistics can be directly tested using fully self - consistent 2df observations . requiring the model to account for the differences in the observed correlation functions of the red and blue populations",
    "is an especially stringent test .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec.formalism ]",
    "we describe the halo model in detail .",
    "we introduce the 2pigg catalogue in section [ sec.2pigg ] and describe how the properties of interest are inferred from the observational data . in section [ sec.hod ] the halo occupation distribution is investigated , and in section [ sec.rad.dist ] we examine the radial distribution of galaxies within the 2piggs .",
    "finally , in section [ sec.cfs ] , the halo model is applied to our results , and the predicted clustering results compared with observations .",
    "in essence , the halo model exemplifies the natural distinction between linear ( large - scale ) and non - linear ( small - scale ) clustering .",
    "indeed , the two regimes appear as separate terms in the halo model galaxy power spectrum : @xmath4 with @xmath5 the _",
    "intra_-halo , non - linear term , and @xmath6 the _",
    "inter_-halo , linear term .",
    "although we will later require the two - point correlation functions , @xmath7 , explicit calculation of these involves convolutions of the halo profiles ; we prefer instead to work in fourier space , ultimately obtaining the correlation function via the transform @xmath8 with @xmath9 , the dimensionless form of the power spectrum .    within the halo model framework , the components of the galaxy power spectrum are ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath10 and @xmath11 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the integrals are over the halo mass , @xmath12 . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath13 is the halo mass function , @xmath14 is the halo biasing factor , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the first and second factorial moments of the halo occupation distribution , @xmath3 , respectively , @xmath17 is the average number density of galaxies , and @xmath18 is the fourier transform of the normalised radial distribution of galaxies within haloes .",
    "the following sections describe these terms in more detail .    in keeping with the ethos of this work , we opt to use the simplest possible implementation of the halo model .",
    "we note for completeness that the implementation may be modified to account for the expectation that the first galaxy in each halo resides at the halo centre of mass ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the number density of haloes of mass @xmath12 in space is described by the mass function , @xmath13 , which we assume to have the form proposed by @xcite ( an extension of the @xcite form ) : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the background density of the universe , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and normalisation implies @xmath24 .",
    "the mass variable is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the linear - theory prediction for the present day overdensity of a region undergoing spherical collapse at redshift @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the r.m.s .",
    "variance of the present day linear power spectrum in a spherical top - hat which contains an average mass @xmath12 .",
    "note that the mass function depends on the redshift only through @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the linear growth factor , normalized so that @xmath32 .",
    "the value of @xmath33 is only weakly sensitive to the cosmological model @xcite .",
    "haloes are biased tracers of the overall dark matter distribution .",
    "the degree of bias is a function of the halo mass .",
    "following @xcite , we can write the power spectrum of dark matter haloes of given masses , @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 we further assume @xmath37 , the linear dark matter power spectrum , since inter - halo correlations are only important on large , quasi - linear scales .",
    "@xcite derive the required halo bias factors , @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 taking the values given in section [ sec.mass_fn ] .",
    "the halo occupation distribution , @xmath3 , appears in the power spectrum ( equations [ eqn.1halo ] and [ eqn.2halo ] ) through its first and second factorial moments , @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the galaxy number density is given by @xmath43    the spatial distribution of galaxies within haloes is assumed to be spherically symmetric about the halo centre , so that the density profile , @xmath44 , is a function of @xmath45 only for a halo of a given mass @xmath12 .",
    "the profile is normalized so that @xmath46 ( @xmath47 will be defined in equation [ eqn.rvir ] ) , and the fourier transform of the normalized profile is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "we attempt to directly measure the radial density and halo occupation distributions in subsequent sections .      on distance scales for which the inter - halo term is important",
    ", @xmath48 is a good approximation .",
    "the integral on the right - hand side of equation [ eqn.2halo ] is then independent of scale and we can re - write the relations as : @xmath49 where we have defined the galaxy bias parameter as : @xmath50      as we have stressed , our aim is to rely on observations wherever possible , avoiding model - dependent assumptions .",
    "our underlying assumption is that the observed galaxy groups represent the haloes .",
    "even if this assumption is not perfect it is very likely that there is a simple ranking relation between the observed galaxy groups and the underlying dark matter haloes .",
    "although we could take for @xmath13 the histogram of the observed groups versus their estimated mass , we prefer to use the more robust mass function @xmath13 given by equation [ eqn.mf ] .",
    "future group samples with accurate masses will allow us to use them directly for @xmath13 .",
    "equation [ eqn.1halo ] requires knowledge of the occupation quantities @xmath15 , @xmath51 and the radial profile @xmath52 which we shall determine directly from the 2pigg sample per galaxy type .",
    "the mean number of galaxies ( equation [ eqn.ndens ] ) then follows from the above @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "the halo - halo correlation power spectrum @xmath6 could in principle be taken directly from the group - group power spectrum .",
    "the group - group correlation functions have actually been derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , biases in mapping the groups to haloes may make this approach somewhat inaccurate with the present data .",
    "while this should be possible with future group samples here we follow the approximation given by equations [ eqn.bias_param ] and [ eqn.gal_bias ] . in fact , as shown later in section [ sec.bias ] , we find that @xmath53 is close to unity , interestingly in accord with the biasing derived from the 2df linear galaxy - galaxy power spectrum @xcite combined with pre - wmap cmb measurements @xcite . in practice",
    "we use equations [ eqn.bias_param ] and [ eqn.gal_bias ] with the linear power spectrum of the dark matter , @xmath54 , which has been well constrained by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the galaxy power spectrum on linear scales has also been measured observationally , for example by @xcite from the 2dfgrs , and @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the shapes of these power spectra have been shown to be consistent with a flat universe @xmath55-cdm matter power spectrum , with present epoch @xmath56 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore assume this form for @xmath54 , adopting the wmap normalisation @xmath57 @xcite and the biasing parameter derived in section [ sec.bias ] .",
    "we emphasize again that although we have to compromise here by making several theoretical assumptions , it would be possible in the future to use galaxy and group catalogues to test the halo model almost without any theoretical prior .",
    "we assume that galaxy groups are representative of the underlying dark matter haloes .",
    "the 2dfgrs percolation - inferred galaxy group catalogue ( 2pigg ; @xcite ) is currently the largest homogeneous sample of galaxy groups publicly available .",
    "it comprises @xmath5829,000 groups containing at least two galaxy members , which host a total of @xmath58105,000 galaxies .",
    "as described in the following subsections , we apply a number of cuts to the catalogue in order to improve the quality of the sample used in our analyses ( our final sample comprises @xmath59 groups ) .",
    "an independent attempt at constructing a galaxy group catalogue for the 2dfgrs has been made by @xcite , using a halo model - based algorithm .",
    "although it is not the aim of this work to perform a comparative study of the two catalogues we note relevant differences where appropriate .",
    "the 2pigg groups were identified from the 2dfgrs by means of a friends - of - friends ( fof ) percolation algorithm .",
    "@xcite tested the algorithm on mock samples generated from cosmological dark matter simulations in order to optimize the mapping between the recovered galaxy groups and the actual dark matter haloes ; this strengthens the case for our prior assumption that galaxy groups may be identified with the true bound structures in the dark matter distribution .",
    "@xcite tuned their group - finding algorithm so as to maximize the completeness of the recovered groups .",
    "consequently , very few true group members are erroneously excluded , but this is at the expense of increased contamination by interlopers ( i.e. field galaxies assigned to groups , or false groups comprised entirely of field galaxies ) .",
    "the severity of the contamination increases with redshift ; following @xcite , we discard groups at redshifts greater than @xmath60 . at this redshift",
    "the total number of field galaxies included in groups rises to @xmath61 per cent of the total number of true group members , and the number of interlopers increases very rapidly with redshift beyond this point .",
    "this cut leaves @xmath5816,000 remaining groups .",
    "we note that the halo - based group finder of @xcite achieves similar completeness to standard fof but reduces the contamination level , typically by a factor of two ( for group masses @xmath62 ) .",
    "@xcite used a principal component analysis of the 2dfgrs dataset to define , @xmath63 , a continuous parametrization of spectral type .",
    "this parameter is most strongly correlated with the current star formation rate in each galaxy , but is also a good indicator for morphological type and colour .",
    "following @xcite , we broadly classify galaxies in our sample using a cut at @xmath64 .",
    "we label galaxies with @xmath65 ( relatively active ) as _ blue _ galaxies , and those with @xmath66 ( relatively passive ) as _ red_. we exclude from our analysis any group which does not have a measurement of @xmath63 for _ all _ its member galaxies .",
    "this reduces the sample to @xmath5814,000 groups .",
    "the majority of the 2piggs have a measurement for the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath67",
    ". this can be used to estimate the group mass as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the r.m.s .",
    "projected separation from the central galaxy of the remaining galaxies assigned to the group . through use of simulated mock surveys ,",
    "@xcite derive the value @xmath70 by requiring that the estimated mass be unbiased with respect to that of the underlying dark matter haloes .",
    "the simulated dark matter haloes are identified using a friends - of - friends algorithm , and the recovered haloes have mean spherical overdensities of @xmath71 times the background density ( eke , private communication ) .",
    "@xcite define the mass of a halo to be that enclosed within such an overdensity , thus it is valid to identify the mass estimate of equation [ eqn.2pigg_mass ] with the halo mass used throughout section [ sec.formalism ] .",
    "the measurement of the velocity dispersion is very unreliable for groups with a small number of observed galaxies , and even for groups with large memberships we must be wary of the significant scatter in the relation between group mass and the velocity dispersion ( see fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have independently constructed a galaxy group catalogue for the 2dfgrs .",
    "they investigate the reliability of dynamical mass estimates , and propose an alternative halo mass assignment based on total group luminosity .",
    "this gives them a particular advantage at low group masses where the dynamical masses are especially unreliable .    to avoid the poorest mass estimates we retain only those groups with at least four observed galaxy members .",
    "_ the final sample contains 3,147 groups hosting a total of 25,118 galaxies ( of which 12,851 are blue and 12,267 are red)_.    in order to maintain internal consistency regarding the definition of the group mass , we define the group virial radius , @xmath72 to be that enclosing a spherical overdensity @xmath73 times the background density of the universe ( at the group redshift ) .      in order to estimate the true galaxy membership of the 2piggs it is necessary to correct for ( i ) the flux limit , and ( ii ) the incompleteness of the 2df survey due to e.g. constraints on fibre positioning .",
    "@xcite compute for each galaxy a weight , @xmath74 , to account for the local incompleteness of the survey .",
    "these weights only account for missed galaxies which are brighter than the local magnitude limit , @xmath75 ; the flux limit is not yet accounted for .",
    "in order for the group membership to be well - defined observationally , a limiting absolute magnitude , @xmath76 , must be specified .",
    "we explain in section [ sec.cfs ] how our choices for this limit are dictated by the samples used in determining the observed correlation functions ; the values we use are @xmath77 for red , blue and all galaxies respectively .    the faintest detectable absolute magnitude at distance @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 for galaxies of spectral type @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the @xmath82-correction ( measured for each spectral type by @xcite ) . of all the galaxies more luminous than the threshold @xmath76",
    ", the fraction which are detectable at distance @xmath78 is given by the _ selection function _",
    ": @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "a further complication is that galaxies with @xmath85 were removed from the redshift catalogue ; the lower integration limit of the numerator in equation [ eqn.sel_fn ] is adjusted to account for this .",
    "since we are dealing with galaxies in groups we choose to use luminosity functions ( lfs ) specific to the populations of these over - dense regions , rather than those of the whole 2df sample .",
    "@xcite have derived 2df lfs as a function of density environment and per spectral type .",
    "we use their ` cluster ' lfs for red and blue galaxies to compute the selection function for the 2piggs .",
    "we can now assign to each galaxy a weight @xmath86 , which accounts for both the local incompleteness and the luminosity and flux limits .",
    "this weight is defined as @xmath87 for a galaxy of spectral type @xmath80 hosted by a group at distance @xmath78 , where @xmath88 is the absolute magnitude of the galaxy in question .",
    "the galaxy membership of a group , complete to the absolute magnitude limit , may finally be obtained by summing these weights over the galaxies assigned to the group .",
    "having estimated the group membership as described in section [ sec.grp.mem ] , we calculate the mean halo occupation numbers as a function of group mass ( figs [ fig.hod.all ] and [ fig.hod.spec ] ) .",
    "the error bars on these points are purely statistical : the uncertainty in the mass estimates is not directly accounted for .",
    "@xcite have used simulated galaxy group data to gauge the impact of this dispersion on the determination of @xmath89 . amongst their conclusions",
    "they find :    \\(i ) the exclusion of groups with fewer than four observed members is responsible for @xmath90 being systematically overestimated at low masses ( @xmath91 ) . , our sample does in fact include groups with fewer than four members . ]",
    "\\(ii ) at higher masses , the measured amplitude is likely to be biased relative to the true value .",
    "this is due to the decrease in group abundance with increasing mass : of the groups scattered into a particular mass range , the majority originate from lower masses ( and therefore have a lower average occupation number ) .",
    "\\(iii ) despite the scatter , the recovered slope at high group masses is not significantly biased ( for sufficiently steep @xmath92 and [ eqn.2halo ] do not directly depend on the amplitude of @xmath90 since @xmath17 scales identically , so the expected bias in our measurement is not a great concern in this context ( but see section [ sec.lowmass ] ) .",
    "semi - analytic models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) unanimously predict that @xmath90 should tend to a power - law at high masses .",
    "the behaviour at low masses is expected to be somewhat more complicated , particularly when the occupation numbers of red and blue sub - populations are considered separately .",
    "unfortunately , as @xcite predict , we are unable to reliably probe the halo occupation distribution for masses less than @xmath93 . in the interests of keeping our results as empirical as possible , we therefore adopt the simplest possible model for the mean occupation number : a single power - law with a cut - off at low mass .",
    "thus , @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are free parameters .",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath96 may be reliably recovered , despite the dispersion in the mass , for @xmath97 .    using only the data for groups with @xmath98 ,",
    "we have fitted power - laws to the measured mean occupation numbers ; the best - fitting parameters are given in table [ tab.hod ] and the fits are overlaid on the results in figs [ fig.hod.all ] and [ fig.hod.spec ] . in this high mass limit",
    "the power - law provides a good fit .",
    "we find @xmath99 for all three samples , so these estimates of the high - mass slope ought not to be seriously affected by the scatter in the mass .",
    "our results for the power - law slope at high group masses are in good agreement with previous work .",
    "for example , @xcite make simple fits to the semi - analytic models of @xcite and find power - laws with @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( but note that their definitions of ` red ' and ` blue ' differ from ours ) .",
    "@xcite use the observed 2df correlation functions to constrain the hod .",
    "they use the same cut on @xmath63 ( see section [ sec.eta ] ) to define red and blue populations , and find for their best - fitting models @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the high - mass limit .",
    "@xcite find the median concentration parameter for dark matter haloes to be a function of halo mass : @xmath105 at @xmath106 .",
    "in combination with the mass function , @xmath13 ( equation [ eqn.mf ] ) , this allows us to write down the global distribution of @xmath107 as @xmath108    figure [ fig.global ] shows this global distribution for haloes in the mass range @xmath109 , assuming @xmath110 is lognormal with @xmath111 .",
    "the combination with the mass function leads to a slight widening of the distribution , particularly on the low-@xmath107 tail .",
    "this result clearly depends on the assumption of forms for @xmath112 and @xmath110 , both of which we have derived from simulated dark matter haloes . our observational results ( fig .",
    "[ fig.concs ] ) suggest that @xmath113 depends on the host halo mass no more strongly than does the dark matter concentration parameter .",
    "what is most important is that the combination with the mass function has not significantly altered the shape of the distribution , so that the results of section [ sec.stacking ] still hold when we stack groups covering a wide range of masses , albeit with a slightly wider underlying distribution of @xmath107 .",
    "the dynamical masses determined by @xcite for the 2pigg groups have a large scatter , particularly for small ( low membership ) groups .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite illustrates the dependence of this scatter on group membership .",
    "since low - membership groups are the most abundant in the 2pigg catalogue , one might expect the scaling error to be dominated by their contribution . fortunately however , the impact on the stacked profile of groups with a particular membership , @xmath114 , is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "thus , although there are many more low - membership groups , the individual groups have proportionally less impact on the stacked profile than a single high - membership group .",
    "it turns out that @xmath115 is nearly independent of @xmath114 for the 2pigg catalogue , so the overall scaling error receives roughly equal contributions from all group memberships .",
    "we adopt @xmath116 as our fiducial point , since the error distribution here is close to average .",
    "the distribution of @xmath117 at @xmath116 is roughly lognormal with median 1.26 and @xmath118 . propagating the error distribution of @xmath117 through equation [ eqn.rvir ]",
    "implies that @xmath119 has a lognormal distribution with median 1.08 and @xmath120 : the @xmath121 relation means the large scatter in the mass estimates is considerably suppressed , leading to a somewhat narrower distribution of @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.blur ] ) .    the aggregate profile obtained by stacking profiles with an uncertain radial scaling",
    "is given by @xmath122 where we have defined the scaling error , @xmath123 , and its probability distribution @xmath124 which , as we have discussed above , may be approximated by a lognormal distribution .",
    "this profile is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.blur_prof ] .",
    "the scaling uncertainty has the effect of smoothing the cut - off at the virial radius , just as observed in section [ sec.rad.dist ] , and causes a significant reduction in the measured concentration parameter ."
