    "high-@xmath0 oxides has been discovered fifteen years ago@xcite but many of their important properties remains not well understood . among these , the pseudogap phenomenon ,",
    "that is , a discrete structure of the energy spectrum above @xmath0 , identified by several different experiments@xcite , has its nature not yet been clarified .",
    "such open problem has attracted a lot of experimental and theoretical effort because it is general belief that its solution is related to the understanding of the superconducting fundamental interaction .",
    "the evidence of such energy gap above the superconducting phase is clearly demonstrated by tunneling@xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite experiments . in the resistivity measurements its presence",
    "is seen by a decrease in the linear behavior below @xmath2@xcite and in the specific heat as a suppression in the linear coefficient @xmath3 of the temperature@xcite .",
    "there is also mounting experimental evidence that the hole doped inhomogeneity into the @xmath4 planes , common to all cuprates , is directly related to the pseudogap phenomenon . in a given family ,",
    "the underdoped compounds near the doping onset of superconductivity have the more inhomogeneous charge distributions and the larger @xmath2 . as the doping level increases ,",
    "the samples become more homogeneous while @xmath2 decreases@xcite . for overdoped compounds",
    "@xmath2 disappears or becomes equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the inhomogeneities were long supposed to be important in the studies of high temperature superconductors@xcite but only after the discovered of the spin - charge stripes@xcite , they have become matter of systematical studies . in the spin - charge stripes scenario ,",
    "regions of the plane are heavily doped ( the stripes ) and other regions are underdoped and fill the space between the charge - rich stripes .",
    "recently , magnetic excitations as the vortex - like nernst effect have been reported above @xmath0@xcite and a local meissner state , which usually appears only in the superconducting phase , has been seen as a precursor to superconductivity@xcite .",
    "such inhomogeneous diamagnetic domains develop near @xmath2 and grow continuously as @xmath5 decreases towards @xmath0 .",
    "near @xmath0 , the domains appear to percolate , according fig.3 from iguchi et al@xcite .    based on all these experimental findings , about the pseudogap phenomenon , local charge inhomogeneities and a non percolative local meissner state between @xmath2 and @xmath0",
    ", we propose a new scenario to explain the high @xmath0 superconductors phenomenology : due to the doping dependent charge inhomogeneities in a given compound with average charge density @xmath6 , there is a distribution of local clusters with spatial dependent charge density @xmath7 , each with its superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is the maximum of all @xmath1 .",
    "as the temperature falls below @xmath2 , some clusters become superconducting , but they are surrounded by metallic and/or antiferromagnetic insulating domains and , consequently , the whole system is not a superconductor .",
    "the number of superconducting clusters increases as the temperature decreases , so the superconducting regions grow and , eventually , at a temperature @xmath0 , they percolate and become able to hold a macroscopic dissipationless current .",
    "exactly as the meissner state domains shown in fig.3 of iguchi et al@xcite .",
    "similar ideas were discussed by ovchinnikov at al@xcite .",
    "they were concerned mainly with the microscopic mechanism which leads to a distribution of @xmath1 and its effect on the density of state . in order to show that these ideas are able to make quantitative predictions and reproduce the high-@xmath0 oxides phase diagram ,",
    "we have performed calculations on a hubbard model and a gap equation is obtained within mean field approach .",
    "the consequence of the microscopic charge inhomogeneities distribution in the @xmath4 planes , possibly in a striped configuration , is the existence of two phases which are spontaneously created in the @xmath8 planes ; regions which are heavily doped or hole - rich form the stripes and others regions which are hole - poor and are created between the charge - rich stripes .",
    "the exactly form of these charge distributions is not known and it is presently matter of research@xcite . we have chosen a distribution capable to reproduce the experimental observations , and for this purpose , we use a combination of a poisson and a gaussian distribution . for a given compound with an average charge density @xmath6 , the hole distribution is function of the local hole density @xmath9 , @xmath10 divided in two branches .",
    "the low density branch represents the hole - poor or non - conducting regions and the high density one represents the hole - rich or metallic regions . as concerns the superconductivity , only the properties of the hole rich branch are important since the current flows through the metallic region",
    ". such distribution may be given by : @xmath11    the plus sign is for the hole - rich ( @xmath12 ) for @xmath13 , the minus to the hole - poor branch ( @xmath14 ) for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the half - width @xmath18 is related with the degree of inhomogeneities and decreases with the hole density in order to represent current observations@xcite .     and",
    "@xmath19 , indicating by the arrows , is the density where percolation can occur.,width=302 ]    an example of the distribution is shown in fig.1 .",
    "for illustration purpose , we show the results for compounds with @xmath20 and @xmath21 and with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . above @xmath24",
    "the charge distribution becomes a simple gaussian centered at @xmath6 with @xmath25 , which reflects the non - existence of the stripes phases and the observed homogeneous charge distribution for the overdoped compounds .",
    "the values of @xmath26 for a given sample are chosen in order that percolation in the hole - rich branch occurs exactly at a given density @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath27 is the maximum temperature which the system can percolate and which we identify as equal to @xmath28 .",
    "although we used a set of parameters to compare with the experimental phase diagram of bi2212 , the main physical aspects can be modeled by others distributions with the similar results . according to percolation theory",
    ", percolation occurs in a square lattice when 59% of the sites or bonds are filled@xcite .",
    "thus , we find the density where the hole - rich branch percolates integrating @xmath29 from @xmath6 till the integral reaches the value of 0.59 , where we define @xmath19 .",
    "below @xmath28 the system percolates and , consequently , it is able to hold a dissipationless supercurrent . to estimate @xmath28 we need to calculate @xmath2 as function of @xmath9",
    "to develop the dynamics of the hole - type carriers in the cu - o planes , we adopt a two dimension extended hubbard hamiltonian in a square lattice of lattice parameter @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the hopping integral between sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is the coulomb on - site correlated repulsion and @xmath36 is the a phenomenological attractive interaction between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 which will will argue later about its possible origin . using a bcs - type mean - field approximation to develop eq.([b ] ) in the momentum space , one obtains the self - consistent gap equation , at finite temperatures  @xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38 which contains the attractive potential @xmath39 in the extended hubbard hamiltonian of eq.2 . for a d - wave order parameter ,",
    "@xmath35 is summed out of the gap equation and the amplitude of the attractive potential @xmath40 is the only unknown variable and become an adjustable parameter@xcite .",
    "@xmath41 is a dispersion relation .",
    "the hole density and the gap equation , are solved self - consistently for a d - wave order parameter@xcite . in fig.2",
    "we plot the temperatures of vanishing gap from eq.2 which we take as @xmath2 , as function of @xmath9 . here",
    "we use @xmath42ev which reproduces well the experimental values of @xmath43 for the bi2212 system@xcite .",
    "the parameters are within 10% to those taken from arpes measurements  @xcite with a nearest neighbor hopping @xmath44ev and further hopping parameters up to fifth neighbor .",
    "the particular form of the @xmath2 curve depends on the values of these hoppings .",
    "notice that the density of holes has a factor of 2 with respect to the values given by ref.@xcite , but in agreement with ref.@xcite as it is more appropriate for the bi2212 system@xcite .     as the onset of vanishing gap and @xmath28 as the percolating threshold .",
    "the experimental points and the symbols are taking from ref.@xcite , width=302 ]    thus the @xmath2 and @xmath0 shown in fig.2 , for a sample with average charge density @xmath6 , are obtained in the follow way : the hole - rich or metallic branch of the distribution describes the regions with hole charge densities @xmath45 .",
    "these charge fluctuations yield clusters with local superconducting temperature @xmath46 , as @xmath9 varies in the sample and one may write @xmath1 , where @xmath47 represents any position inside the compound . for the metallic regions ,",
    "@xmath46 is a decreasing function of @xmath9 and the maximum gap temperature occurs for @xmath48 .",
    "the different metallic regions in this sample have @xmath49 . for temperatures below @xmath2 ,",
    "some superconducting clusters are formed , like small superconducting islands embedding in a metallic and insulating medium .",
    "thus , as the temperature decreases , more clusters become superconducting , and eventually the superconducting regions percolates at @xmath0 , that is , a superconducting current can flow for temperatures @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 decreases continuously with @xmath9 in the superconducting region ( @xmath51 ) , as seen in fig.2 , is very suggestive and in agreement with the early ideas regarding a phonon mediated superconducting interactions : materials whose vibrating atoms interact strongly with the electrons , and are poor metals , should become superconductors at higher temperatures than those good metals , whose atoms interact weakly with electrons@xcite . for cuprates , as the doping level of the samples increases , it is well known that the compounds change from very poor metals in the normal phase to very good metals with typical fermi liquid behavior for overdoped samples .",
    "since @xmath52 is a decreasing curve , for any cuprate family , and assuming that @xmath2 is the onset of superconducting gap , such curve may be a strong indication of the phononic superconducting interaction .",
    "there are several observations and measurements that can be well explained within the percolating approach , we will discuss here only a few examples .",
    "1-harris et al@xcite , through arpes measurements , have reported the anomalous behavior of @xmath53 which decreases steadily with the doping @xmath6 although @xmath0 increases by a factor of 2 for their underdoped samples . in the overdoped region , since @xmath0 also decreases , the behavior is the expected conventional proportionality .",
    "it is well known that superconductors have a constant value for the ratio @xmath54 , being 3.75 for usual isotropic order parameter and 4.18 for @xmath55 solution@xcite .        at low temperature ,",
    "since the superconducting region percolates through different regions , each with a given @xmath56 , tunneling and arpes experiments detect the largest gap present in the compound .",
    "consequently , @xmath53 must be correlated with the onset of vanishing gap @xmath57 which is the largest superconducting temperature in the sample , and not with @xmath28 . as we show in fig.3 , correlating the values plotted in fig.2 for @xmath57 with @xmath53 , we are able to give a reasonable fit for the data of harris et al@xcite on @xmath58 and explains the different energy scales pointed out by harris et al and several others authors .    2- the resistivity measurement is also one of the tools to detect the pseudogap .",
    "the underdoped and optimum doped high-@xmath0 oxides have a linear behavior for the resistivity in the normal phase up to very high temperature .",
    "however , at @xmath2 there is a deviation from the linear behavior and the resistivity falls faster with decreasing temperature@xcite .",
    "this behavior can be understood by our model , with the increasing of superconducting cluster numbers and size , as the temperatures decreases below @xmath2 .",
    "each superconducting cluster produces a short circuit which decreases the resistivity below the linear behavior between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "3- recently measurements of magnetic domains above @xmath0 has been interpreted as a diamagnetic precursor to the meissner state , produced by performed pairs in underdoped @xmath59 thin films@xcite .",
    "the existence of superconducting cluster between @xmath2 and @xmath0 easily explains the appearance of local diamagnetic or meissner domains , and , if there is a temperature gradient in the sample , the local flux flows and produces the dynamic flux flow state@xcite .",
    "4- another important consequence is that the pairing mechanism must be investigated by experiments performed mainly at @xmath2 .",
    "a such experiment was accomplished by rubio temprano et al@xcite , which measured a large isotope effect associated with @xmath2 and an almost negligible isotopic effect associated with @xmath0 in the slightly underdoped @xmath60 compound .",
    "the results strongly support the fact that electron - phonon induced effects are present in the superconducting mechanism associated with @xmath2 and with the percolation approach to @xmath0 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the percolating approach for an inhomogeneous charge distribution on the @xmath4 planes provides new physical explanations for many experiments performed on high-@xmath0 oxides and quantitative results for their phase diagram .",
    "contrary to some current trends , which @xmath0 is regarded as a phase coherence temperature and the existence of a gap phase without coherence between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , in our approach , @xmath0 is a percolating temperature for different regions which , due to the inhomogeneities , possess different local superconducting transition @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , instead of having a superconducting gap @xmath62 and an excitation gap @xmath63 associated with @xmath2 , we have a distribution of locally dependent @xmath64 .",
    "the method described in this work can be applied in any cuprate and yields also several new implications which will be discussed elsewhere , but one of the most interesting is that one can search for materials with very large @xmath0 s if a better control of the local doping level is achieved .",
