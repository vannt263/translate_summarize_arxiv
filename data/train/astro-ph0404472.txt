    "studies of nearby galaxies lay the groundwork for understanding the evolution of more distant systems .",
    "while lacking a massive classical elliptical galaxy , the local group contains the compact elliptical galaxy m32 , which served as the basis for early pioneering efforts to understand the stellar contents of distant galaxies ( e.g. oconnell 1980 ; rose 1985 ) .",
    "however , the nature of m32 , and its relation to classical elliptical galaxies , remains a matter of on - going debate . while it has been suggested that interactions with m31 played a critical role in defining the present - day properties of the galaxy ( e.g. faber 1973 , burkert 1994 ; bekki et al .",
    "2001 ) , the central structural characteristics of m32 suggest that its gross properties have not changed drastically since it formed ( graham 2002 ; choi , guhathakurta , & johnston 2002 ) .",
    "studies of the stellar content of m32 will provide insights into its evolution , and the brightest stars are convenient probes for this purpose .",
    "the brightest red stars in m32 are evolving on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and a number of studies have investigated the resolved stellar content in the outer ( freedman 1989 , 1992 ; elston & silva 1992 ; davidge & jones 1992 , grillmair et al .",
    "1996 , davidge 2000 ) and inner ( davidge et al . 2000 ) regions of this galaxy .",
    "the number density , normalized with respect to red surface brightness , and peak brightness of the brightest agb stars do not change with radius ( davidge 2000 ; davidge et al .",
    "2000 ) , indicating that these stars are well mixed throughout the main body of m32 , and likely belong to a population that formed when its present - day morphology was imprinted .",
    "the bright agb content of m32 also appears to be representative of the inner bulge of m31 and more distant systems ( davidge 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "many of the brightest agb stars are expected to be long period variables ( lpvs ) , and studies of these objects will provide clues into the stellar content of m32 .",
    "for example , the detection of very large amplitude lpvs , such as those that were detected by iras in the galactic bulge ( e.g. glass et al .",
    "1995 , 2001 ) , would be one signature of an intermediate age population . in the present paper , high angular resolution",
    "@xmath2band observations of the brightest agb stars in the central regions of m32 are used to investigate photometric variablity among these objects .",
    "a comparison is made with the lpv content of the galactic bulge .",
    "a series of 60 sec @xmath0 exposures were recorded of the central regions of m32 on the night of ut october 12 2003 as part of the system verification program for altair@xmath1niri .",
    "altair is the facility adaptive optics ( ao ) system on gemini north ( gn ) , and a detailed description of this device has been given by herriot et al .",
    "the nucleus of m32 served as the reference beacon for ao compensation .",
    "niri , which is the facility infrared imager on gn , was used in f/32 mode for these observations , and so the image scale is 0.022 arcsec pixel@xmath3 ; the @xmath4 insb array in niri thus images a @xmath5 arcsec field .",
    "the data were reduced with a standard pipeline for infrared images ( e.g. davidge & courteau 1999 ) .",
    "the image quality was mildly variable on the night the data were recorded , and exposures in which the image quality was noticeably poorer than average were not used .",
    "a total of 12 exposures were combined to construct the final image .",
    "stars in the final dataset have fwhm = 0.10 arcsec .    the deep @xmath2band image discussed by davidge et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which was recorded with the hokupaa ao system and quirc imager on gn during july 2000 , was also used in this study .",
    "the image was rotated and re - sampled to match the orientation and pixel scale of the altair@xmath1niri dataset .",
    "the fwhm of these data are comparable to those obtained with altair , and additional details of these observations are discussed by davidge et al .",
    "the primary statistic used in this study is @xmath6 , which is a measure of photometric stability and the amplitude of light variations among variable stars .",
    "this quantity was computed by taking the difference between the brightnesses of individual stars in the altair and hokupaa images , as measured with the point spread function ( psf)-fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 diagrams for stars in two radial intervals , the inner and outer boundaries of which were selected ( 1 ) to avoid the very crowded inner few arcsec of the galaxy , and ( 2 ) to balance roughly the number of stars in each annulus near the bright end , are shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath8 ranges roughly from 1 to @xmath9 near the bright end of figure 1 , with the majority of points concentrated between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the histogram distribution of @xmath8 for stars in each annulus with @xmath12 between 16.3 and 16.8 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "this particular brightness interval was selected to sample ( 1 ) a moderately large number of stars at a brightness where incompleteness is not significant ( see below ) , and ( 2 ) stars that are well above the rgb - tip . based on the calibration derived by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from globular clusters and assuming an old solar - metallicity population , then the rgb - tip occurs near @xmath13 in m32 if the distance modulus is @xmath14 ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 distributions of stars in the two annuli have a similar gaussian - like appearance , with a standard deviation @xmath15 mag",
    ". at least part of the spread in @xmath8 is a consequence of random photometric errors .",
    "artificial star experiments were run to assess the size of the random uncertainties in these data , and these experiments predict that the dispersion due to random errors is @xmath16 mag in each interval , which is sigificantly smaller than the observed dispersion in @xmath8 . the artificial star experiments also indicate that the data in both radial intervals are @xmath17 complete when @xmath18 is between 16.3 and 16.8 .    that the @xmath8 distributions near the center of m32 are much broader than expected from observational errors indicates that many of the stars are photometrically variable .",
    "in fact , the @xmath8 distributions measured in m32 are remarkably consistent with what is expected from a pure population of long period variables ( lpvs ) like those in the galactic bulge . to demonstrate this point , the extensive observations of lpvs in the sgr i field of the galactic bulge obtained by glass et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were used to create a reference @xmath8 distribution for comparison with the m32 data .",
    "the glass et al .",
    "( 1995 ) observations are ideal for this purpose because they sample a moderately large number of stars with intrinsic brightnesses that are comparable to the target objects in m32 , while also spanning a time baseline that exceeds that between the hokupaa and altair observations .    the observations for each star in table 1 of glass et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were paired , with the restriction that the difference in epochs between the observations in each pair was at least 1000 days in order to match the approximate time difference between the hokupaa and altair datasets .",
    "the difference in @xmath2band brightness for each data pair , which corresponds to @xmath8 , was then computed .",
    "typically 4  5 independent ( i.e. such that each observation was used only in one pair ) @xmath8 values were computed for each star .",
    "large amplitude iras variables were not included , as these objects have very red colors , and there is no evidence for such a population in m32 ( davidge 2000 ; davidge et al .",
    "2000 ) .    the histogram distribution of the @xmath8 measurements constructed from the glass et al .",
    "( 1995 ) observations was convolved with a @xmath19 gaussian to account for the smearing introduced by random uncertainties in the m32 dataset and the result , scaled to match the number of stars in each radial m32 interval , is compared with the m32 @xmath8 distributions in figure 2 .",
    "the galactic and m32 @xmath8 distributions agree within the estimated @xmath20 uncertainties in the vast majority of bins , and a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that the galactic and m32 @xmath8 distributions are not significantly different .    it is likely that some of the bright stars in m32 are not variable , and so composite models consisting of a non - variable component , the @xmath8 distribution of which was represented by a gaussian with @xmath19 mag , and galactic bulge lpvs were also considered .",
    "model @xmath8 distributions that include a minority non - variable component give a better match to the m32 @xmath8 distribution than the lpv  only model .",
    "the best agreement with the m32 @xmath8 distribution occurs when @xmath21 of the stars are lpvs , and this model is compared with the m32 @xmath8 distributions in figure 3 .",
    "the m32 and model @xmath8 distributions differ at the @xmath22 confidence level or greater when less than @xmath23 of the stars are lpvs .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 distribution of the brightest agb stars near the center of m32 is consistent with at least @xmath23 of these objects having an amplitude distribution similar to lpvs in the galactic bulge .",
    "we have measured the change in @xmath2band magnitude of bright agb stars near the center of m32 over a 3 year baseline .",
    "the distribution of brightness differences , which is a measure of the amplitude of light variations , has been compared with that expected for lpvs detected at visible - red wavelengths in the galactic bulge .",
    "it is concluded that at least 60% of the bright agb stars near the center of m32 are lpvs with amplitudes similar to lpvs in the galactic bulge .",
    "rejkuba et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discuss the properties of lpvs in the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 ( cen a ) .",
    "they find that ( 1 ) the majority of lpvs are like those in the galactic bulge , and ( 2 ) in one of the fields they studied at least 70% of the agb stars are lpvs .",
    "these results are very similar to what we find in m32 . however , rejkuba et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also found that 10% of the lpvs had periods that were comparable to the iras variables detected in the galactic bulge , which presumably come from a population that is younger than the shorter period lpvs .",
    "very long period , large amplitude lpvs were intentionally excluded from the comparison in  3 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath8 values computed from the iras variables studied by glass et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is very different from that computed from the variables discovered at visible - red wavelengths , and the standard deviation in the @xmath8 distribution computed solely from iras variables is @xmath24 mag , which is almost three times that measured for lpvs detected at visible - red wavelengths .",
    "there are some bright objects in the @xmath25 diagram that have @xmath26 , but these are probably the extreme members of a lower amplitude lpv distribution .",
    "there is a selection effect working against the detection of large amplitude variables in the current study , as they may fall below the detection limit when at the faint points in their light curves ; however , these variables should be easy to detect when near the peak of their light curves . while we can not discount the presence of a modest number of large amplitude variables in m32 with these data , it is worth noting that these objects tend to have very red colors , and the narrow , well - defined agb sequence see near the center of m32 ( davidge et al . 2000 ) and at moderately large radii ( davidge 2000 ) argues against the presence of such a population .",
    "surveys of variable stars in baade s window ( bw ) reveal objects with a range of characteristics that match those seen in the magellanic clouds ( glass & schultheis 2003 ) .",
    "some of the variables in bw have modest amplitudes , and such a population is likely to be present in m32 ; indeed , some fraction of the ` non - variable ' component included in the models may actually be small amplitude variables . however , the number of small amplitude variables in our sample is likely modest . assuming that the distance modulus of m32 is @xmath14 ( van den bergh 2000 ) , and that the distance modulus of the sgr i field is @xmath27 ( glass et al .",
    "1995 ) , then the range of brightnesses used to construct the m32 @xmath28 distribution in figure 2 corresponds to k@xmath29 between 6.6 and 7.1 in bw .",
    "it is evident from figure 7 of glass & schultheis ( 2003 ) that the variable stars in bw in this brightness interval tend to have log(p ) @xmath30 , and hence are larger amplitude variables .",
    "lower amplitude variables occur in large numbers in bw only when @xmath31 , and it can be anticipated that these objects will become more significant in m32 at fainter brightnesses than considered here .",
    "we close by noting that with the up - coming generation of ao - equipped @xmath32 metre telescopes it will be possible to resolve bright stars in spheroids in the virgo cluster and beyond ( e.g. anthony et al .",
    "2003 ) . a traditional characterization of lpvs in galaxies at this distance , involving observations over a large number of nights to obtain light curves , may only be practical for a modest number of systems because of the long integration times involved and time assignment pressures imposed by the need for nights with superb imaging conditions .",
    "the technique employed here , which requires observations covering only two epochs , provides an economical means of surveying the amplitude characteristics of lpvs in a large number of systems ."
