    "this concern is related to the persistent question of whether the serendipitous surveys preferentially select non - cooling core clusters , while the all - sky surveys favor cooling core clusters ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "under agn feedback models , cooling core clusters are more likely to host central radio agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , even if the serendipitous and all - sky surveys differ , figure  [ fig : nvssfrac ] suggests that this does not mask an increasing trend in the radio fraction with redshift and luminosity among the higher - redshift and more luminous clusters .",

    "for the most massive clusters , with x - ray luminosities of @xmath180@xmath2 , the average agn input energy is also significant , at 0.2 to 0.3 kev / particle .",
    "note that the energy input of the single agn outburst in the ms0735 + 7421 cluster is @xmath181kev per particle within the central 1 mpc @xcite .",
    "it is therefore plausible that a single , powerful agn outburst can rival the integrated agn energy input over time .",
    "a few points need to be addressed regarding the results in figure  [ fig : cavitypower ] .",
    "first , the average jet powers are affected disproportionately by the most powerful radio sources , which are the least likely to be background sources .",
    "as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : cavitypower ] , the average agn energy deposited per particle for x - ray luminous clusters would be boosted by a factor of two assuming the scaling relation equation  ( [ eqn : high ] ) holds for the few sources with @xmath109@xmath2 .",
    "this would imply that a single , powerful radio agn can be as important to heating atmospheres as the integrated power output of radio sources over time . as discussed in section [ sec : sample_cavpow ] , equation  ( [ eqn : high ] ) may be overestimating the @xmath39 for the few powerful sources with @xmath182@xmath2 in figure  [ fig : cavagnolo ] .",
    "the saturated scaling relation gives average jet powers including all radio sources ( diamonds ) that differ little from those obtained when the powerful radio sources are excluded ( circles ) .",
    "if the scaling relation does saturate , the small offsets between the spheres and diamonds in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : cavitypower ] show that excluding the most powerful sources makes little difference to the mean jet power estimates .",
    "on the other hand , our assumption that the cluster masses ( @xmath163 ) remain constant for the calculation of the mean energy injected per particle fails to consider the hierarchical assembly of clusters . allowing for cluster growth",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that jet power from central radio agn in clusters could increase by a factor of 10 per particle from @xmath183 back to 1.1 . at earlier times ,",
    "agn jets are more powerful and cluster progenitors are less massive .",
    "the long term effect of preheating of these early radio agn should be considered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the energy from radio jets accumulates more quickly per icm particle in the building blocks of present day clusters . as less massive clusters assemble to form more massive ones , most of the excess energy is preserved . by ignoring this effect ,",
    "we have certainly underestimated the total agn energy accumulated in the icm of massive clusters over their histories .",
    "one effect that might counteract this is that radio jets could break out of the atmospheres of less massive halos ( e.g. , the poorly confined sample of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing some jet energy to escape .",
    "however , the huge mass of gas that will form the atmosphere of an incipient cluster is present from the outset and very few jets can escape from that .",
    "jet energy escaping from a smaller atmosphere will be deposited in surrounding gas that is fated to collapse into the cluster .",
    "unless the energy deposited by a jet is sufficient to unbind this gas from the cluster , it inevitably collapses into the cluster at some later time , carrying the excess energy along with it ( apart from energy lost to radiation ) .",
    "our calculations ignore energy lost from the icm by x - ray radiation .",
    "if we are interested in the net energy gain from radio jets , this must be taken into account .",
    "on the face of it , the upper panel of figure  [ fig : cavitypower ] shows that the x - ray power radiated by the clusters in our sample exceeds the average power input from the central agn for @xmath184 .",
    "our estimates of the mean jet power are conservative and only include central radio sources ( projected within 250 kpc ) , when other radio sources may augment the total energy input significantly @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the icm of the most luminous clusters suffers a net energy loss .",
    "it should be borne in mind that most of the x - ray power radiated by the great majority of clusters does not originate from a cooling core .",
    "outside cooling cores it will take a very long time for the energy loss to have any noticeable impact .",
    "central cooling times are available in the accept database @xcite for only 110 members of our sample , leaving us poorly placed to examine the net effect of jets on cooling core clusters .",
    "notably , figure  [ fig : cavitypower ] shows that , even with our conservative estimates for the energy input from central radio jets , clusters less luminous than @xmath185 see a net energy gain .",
    "thus , energy injected by central radio agn accumulates in lower mass clusters , so that the integrated energy gain shown in the lower panel of the figure is mostly retained in these systems and has a significant impact on the icm .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : fraction ] , our sample shows increases in the fraction of clusters with central radio agn for increases in both the x - ray luminosity and the redshift ( figure  [ fig : nvssfrac ] ) .",
    "it is , therefore , surprising that we do not see a more pronounced increase in the mean jet power with x - ray luminosity in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : cavitypower ] .",
    "the primary cause of this is the large scatter introduced by using equation  ( [ eqn : high ] ) to convert radio powers to jet powers .",
    "there is good reason to believe that mean jet powers do increase with cluster luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite , @xcite ) . however , the modest increase is buried by the scatter in the @xmath186 relation . it is clearly desirable to find a more accurate way to estimate jet powers .",
    "the integrated power output from radio - agn at the centers of clusters over the past @xmath187 gyr implies substantial supermassive black hole growth .",
    "we have estimated the accreted mass required to fuel agn from the integrated agn power output over time .",
    "we assume a conversion efficiency between accreted mass and mechanical jet power of @xmath6 , where @xmath188 , and we ignore radiation loses .",
    "we note that , although @xmath6 is commonly used in literature , the distribution of @xmath189 is an open issue ( for a more detailed discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "in some accretion models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath189 approaches unity at high black hole spin .",
    "however , many estimates of @xmath189 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest a small @xmath189 , with @xmath6 near the upper limit of reasonable values for the jet efficiency .",
    "if the average efficiency is lower , the nuclear black holes need to grow even more to power these radio sources . integrating the agn mechanical energies shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : cavitypower ] over @xmath190 gyr ( @xmath191 ) gives an average accreted mass of @xmath192 per supermassive black hole . extrapolating back to @xmath4 over a look - back time of about @xmath193gyr , and assuming the modestly rising agn power discussed earlier , implies an average increase of @xmath194 per supermassive black hole .",
    "note that , in hierarchically assembling clusters , this mass may be distributed among several black holes .",
    "these values are comparable to the black hole masses of bcgs inferred from black hole scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are thought to have been imprinted during the quasar era .",
    "our result implies that normal agn maintained over time by hot atmospheres may be as important to supermassive black hole growth in bcgs as earlier and , presumably , much more rapid formation processes ( see the review in * ? ? ?",
    "it is conceivable that normal radio - agn activity may give rise to black hole masses in excess of the mass expected from the @xmath195@xmath42 relation for bcgs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath189 indeed lie well below 0.1 , the inferred black hole growth rates may be even larger , leading to the possibility of growing ultramassive black holes in bcgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have combined eight surveys of x - ray clusters to compile a composite sample with 1032 clusters located in the area covered by the nvss . for each nvss radio source projected within 250kpc of a cluster center , we have estimated the mechanical power of its radio jet using the scaling relation , equation  ( [ eqn : high ] ) , from @xcite .",
    "the jet power is weakly correlated with the x - ray luminosity of a hosting cluster , but the most powerful radio sources , with @xmath196@xmath2 , are all located in massive , cooling core clusters . the correlation is stronger if only the strong cooling core clusters with @xmath102gyr are considered .",
    "we have also examined the distribution of radio source powers in cooling and non - cooling core clusters , using values of @xmath93  from the accept project @xcite . based on the modest number of our sample clusters in the accept database , radio sources in non - cooling core clusters are , in general , as powerful as those in cooling core clusters , except that the most powerful sources mostly appear in cooling cores .",
    "we have examined both the average radio power of clusters and the fraction of clusters with radio sources .",
    "the cluster sample is large enough to separate the dependence of the radio source fraction on redshift and cluster x - ray luminosity and we find that it increases moderately with both .",
    "the average power is also larger in more massive clusters and at higher redshifts .",
    "finally , we have calculated the average agn jet power using the scaling relation in equation  ( [ eqn : high ] ) @xcite .",
    "this overestimates @xmath39  for the few powerful radio sources in our sample with @xmath197@xmath2 , so that the average jet power would be dominated by these extremely powerful sources .",
    "two approaches were used to solve this problem . in the first approach , the most powerful sources were simply excluded from the calculations , giving a lower limit on the average jet power . in the second approach , @xmath39  for the powerful radio sources",
    "was determined using a saturated version of the scaling relation , with the saturation level set empirically and saturated jet power based on the cavity powers of the five most powerful sources in our sample .",
    "the average jet powers determined using these two approaches are similar . in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : cavitypower ] ,",
    "the average jet power is plotted against the cluster x - ray luminosity . although the average jet power for the most luminous clusters is higher than for less luminous clusters , large uncertainties in their estimation make the differences insignificant . in general",
    ", the average jet power exceeds @xmath198@xmath2 even in the least luminous clusters , with @xmath199@xmath2 .",
    "thus , the average jet power exceeds the radiation output of the least massive sample clusters by an order of magnitude .",
    "the average jet power was integrated to redshift @xmath4 using two simple evolutionary models for the radio sources .",
    "for the first model , the radio power was taken to be constant and then the average agn energy injected by jets exceeds 1kev per particle in the least luminous clusters , with @xmath200@xmath2 , and @xmath201kev per particle in the most luminous clusters , with @xmath202@xmath2 . here",
    ", the number of gas particles was calculated using the gas mass within @xmath17 , determined from the @xmath203 relation . for the second model ,",
    "the average jet power was taken to be a linear function of the cosmic time and then , integrating to @xmath4 , the agn energy input amounts to @xmath204kev per particle for clusters with @xmath200@xmath2and @xmath205kev per particle for clusters with @xmath206@xmath2 .",
    "existing x - ray data for our sample are inadequate to distinguish the energy radiated by gas that would be significantly affected by radiative cooling . however , the total radiation output of the less massive clusters is small compared to the energy input from agn .",
    "if the energy injected by agn is stored in these systems , we estimate that the agn energy injected since @xmath207 is significant for preheating of clusters .",
    "if so , rather than preheating , the effect of the agn would be better described as `` continual heating . '' in carrying out these calculations , we have ignored the hierarchical assembly of clusters by assuming that the cluster masses are fixed . since massive clusters assembled from less massive clusters , where the jet power per particle is larger , we expect that our estimates of the total agn energy accumulated in massive clusters are low .",
    "we conclude that continual agn energy input in the `` radio mode '' could well provide @xmath208kev per particle in less massive clusters , which approaches the excess energy required to account for observed departures from the self - similar scaling relations that would be expected otherwise @xcite .",
    "lastly , we have estimated the mass that was accreted by supermassive black holes in bcgs to fuel their radio agn and power their jets . assuming that the jet power is related to the accretion rate by @xmath209 , for a typical bcg in our sample , the nuclear black hole would have grown by about @xmath210 since @xmath171 .",
    "this is comparable to black hole masses for bcgs estimated by @xcite , implying that that the fueling of radio agn at the centers of hot atmospheres may be as significant as the earlier quasar era for the growth of supermassive black holes in bcgs .",
