    "the materials of choice for the bimetallic metamaterial system are au and ni which comprise the two arc sectors that form the complete ring ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "the angle , over which the ni sector spans , controls the composition of the ring .",
    "three samples have been fabricated by electron - beam lithography ( see methods for details ) with ni sectors of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the mean diameter of the rings is @xmath4 nm with a linewidth of @xmath5 nm and a height of @xmath6 nm . each sample comprises a regular array of @xmath7 unit cells , positioned with a period of @xmath8 nm and covering a total area of @xmath9m@xmath10 .    a strong plasmonic resonance can be excited in the metamaterial under illumination with light polarized in the plane of symmetry of the resonators ( yz plane - see fig .  [",
    "fig2]a ) . the characteristic case of a metamaterial with a @xmath1 ni sector is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , where the resonance manifests as a transmission dip at a wavelength of @xmath11 nm . the experimental transmission spectrum ( solid red line ) is in good agreement with the results of numerical modelling ( dashed red line ) . at resonance ,",
    "the electric field profile exhibits two `` hot spots '' of charge concentration , while currents oscillate along the y - axis ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "this configuration corresponds to the lowest - order electric dipole mode of the ring .",
    "scattering and dissipation in the system is determined by the regions of high current density .",
    "strong currents in the ni sector reduce the total power scattered at resonance , since nickel is less conductive and exhibits higher losses than gold due to joule heating . in accordance , increasing the ni sector size leads to damping of the resonance and a decrease of its q - factor as it can be deduced from fig .",
    "such changes in composition also alter the effective permittivity of the hybrid structure and shift the position of the resonance towards shorter wavelengths .    in presence of an external magnetic field ( b )",
    "the permittivity tensor of ni becomes non - diagonal , which affects the polarization state of light that is transmitted through the sample .",
    "the rotation of polarization azimuth , which is induced by the magnetic field , is experimentally measured using a highly sensitive polarimeter setup ( discussed in methods ) and the results are shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] . for all three lengths of the ni sector ( @xmath12 and @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the faraday rotation spectra follow closely the linear optical response with the maxima of rotation occurring close to the plasmonic resonance frequency .",
    "importantly , smaller ni sectors lead to a stronger faraday effect : reducing by @xmath13 the arc length of the ni sector ( from @xmath3 to @xmath1 ) leads to a @xmath14 increase of peak rotation ( from @xmath15mrad to @xmath16mrad ) .",
    "simultaneously , the linewidth of the faraday rotation resonance decreases significantly .",
    "these features are reproduced by finite element simulations ( dashed lines ) following a normalization of numerical transmittance spectra to the experimental ones ( see methods for details ) . in both experiment and theory ,",
    "the spectral position of the peak , highlighted by the grey lines , as well as its linewidth follow similar trends upon increasing the ni sector .",
    "differences in the magnitude , shape and width of the rotation peaks are attributed to inhomogeneities in the fabricated samples .",
    "the counterintuitive dependence of the mo activity on the ni sector arc length suggests that the faraday rotation is controlled by resonant field enhancement in the vicinity of the ni section . in order to quantify this enhancement , we compare the mo response of the metamaterial to that of a continuous ni film .",
    "since the latter exhibits negligible transmission , a straightforward comparison is not instructive .",
    "instead , we use as a figure of merit ( fom ) the scattered electric field component which is normal to the incident polarization , normalized to the incident electric field and to the ni filling factor .",
    "the fom is calculated as @xmath17 ( in the small angle approximation ) , where @xmath18 is the faraday rotation angle , @xmath19 is the ni filling factor , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the amplitudes of the scattered and incident electric fields , respectively .",
    "this fom allows for a comparison between the mo response of the metamaterial in transmission and that of a continuous nickel film in reflection . taking into account that the metamaterial sample with a @xmath1 ni sector has a peak rotation of @xmath22 mrad at @xmath23 nm , transmittance of @xmath24 and a ni filling factor of @xmath25 , the resulting value is @xmath26 . in comparison , a continuous , @xmath6 nm thick , ni film exhibits a reflectance of @xmath27 and a mo rotation of @xmath28mrad at the same wavelength resulting in @xmath29 .",
    "hence , the metamaterial leads to an enhancement of magneto - optical activity of @xmath30 .",
    "( red ) , @xmath2 ( green ) and @xmath3 ( blue ) in the presence of a @xmath31mt external magnetic field .",
    "solid lines act as guide for the eye .",
    "dashed lines represent the corresponding computational results when the linear optical response has been normalized to the experimental values ( see methods ) .",
    "the dashed grey line follows the peak position of simulated data , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , while dot - dashed line shows the corresponding trend for the experimental results.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    owing to the anisotropic nature of the bimetallic rings , the mo response depends strongly on the polarization of the incident wave .",
    "the geometrical position and span of the two metal segments create a system with a single plane of symmetry , deviating from which affects both its plasmonic and mo response . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b we can see that the geometrical anisotropy of the sample leads to polarization conversion ( in the absence of external static magnetic fields ) . varying the angle of polarization azimuth of the excitation beam from @xmath32 to @xmath33 results in a four - lobe rosette with the points of zero conversion at @xmath32 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath34 .",
    "these points correspond to the polarization eigenstates of the system .",
    "in contrast , the effect of anisotropy becomes maximum at n@xmath35 ( for n=1,3,5,7 ) and it results in a rotation of the incident polarization state by about @xmath31mrad .",
    "the introduction of an external magnetic field , creates an additional contribution to the polarization rotation due to magnetically - induced anisotropy , which manifests as an offset of the total rotation . for opposite sign magnetic fields",
    ", this effect appears as a splitting of the rotation curve , where the separation between the two curves corresponds to the faraday effect ( see fig .  [",
    "the angle of the incident wave s polarization azimuth shifts the current distribution along the ring ( between areas of different dielectric properties ) , which significantly affects the plasmonic enhancement of faraday rotation .",
    "when excitation occurs at angles that drive currents through the more lossy areas ( nickel ) , the plasmonic resonance is damped and thus , faraday rotation is reduced by almost @xmath13 ( fig .  [ fig4]c ) .",
    "a detailed numerical study of the effects of ring composition and incidence wave polarization on the faraday rotation is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig5]a & [ fig5]b , respectively . in accordance to our experimental measurements ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , increasing the size of the ni sector leads to an increase both in the dissipation loss ( hence a decrease in plasmonic field enhancement ) and in the filling factor of the mo active material .",
    "these two competing mechanisms result in an optimum ring composition with a ni sector of @xmath36 , away from which faraday rotation rapidly decreases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) .",
    "moreover , rings with relatively small ni sectors ( smaller than @xmath3 ) exhibit a strong dependence in the polarization of the incident wave ( see fig .  [ fig5]b ) . for polarization along the y - axis",
    "( see inset to fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) , the resonant currents flow mainly in the au sector , which leads to a strong plasmonic resonance and ( through field enhancement ) to high values of faraday rotation . when the polarization is rotated by @xmath1 , the current density in ni increases , which damps the mo response . on the contrary , for rings with large ni sectors , the situation reverses and polarization angles normal to the symmetry plane of the ring offer a stronger mo response . in this case , due to the weaker plasmonic resonances , the modulation depth is reduced .",
    "the dependence of the metamaterial mo response on the strength of the external magnetic field was investigated by hysteresis measurements , where the magnetic field intensity is varied , while its direction is maintained .",
    "the measurements reveal an almost linear magnetic field dependence and zero coercivity ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "these observations are explained by considering that the magnetic field is orientated normal to the plane of the nano - rings and that the field strength used in the experiment is not sufficient to saturate their magnetization .",
    "this behaviour is strongly supported by the micromagnetic simulations ( see methods for details ) , represented by the solid lines in fig .",

    "we have shown that bimetallic nano - ring resonators can serve as compact building blocks for magneto - optical devices .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated experimentally strong enhancement of the faraday rotation in metamaterial arrays of such resonators .",
    "we also studied the dependence of the effect on external static magnetic fields , polarization of the incident wave , and wavelength , as means of controlling the magneto - optical response of the metamaterial .",
    "we expect bimetallic metamaterials to find applications in refractive index and magnetic field sensing , as well as in compact active components for integrated nanophotonic circuits .",
    "* fabrication . *",
    "samples of different au - ni ratios were prepared by a two - step electron - beam lithography method on a glass substrate .",
    "each sample is a regular two - dimensional array with a footprint of @xmath38m@xmath10 .",
    "we have manufactured arrays of bimetallic rings with a period of @xmath8 nm and ni sectors of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the fabrication process is separated in two steps , one for each of the two metals . in each step , metals are thermally evaporated on the substrate with a thickness of @xmath6 nm and subsequently lifted - off to reveal the design .",
    "a @xmath39 nm thick layer of co - polymer deposited underneath 200 nm of pmma helps increasing the speed of the lift - off process .",
    "the ni part is deposited after au to minimize any oxidization in the junctions between the two metals .",
    "furthermore , careful design and alignment is crucial in order to achieve good contact at the junctions .",
    "discrepancies between the designed and fabricated samples can be attributed to the surface roughness that is identified mainly in the ni sector and has an rms value that varies from @xmath40 to @xmath41 nm between individual unit cells .",
    "as ni tends to form large grains , nanostructures suffer from small deformations , especially in the z - direction , due to the constrains that the e - beam lithography mask enforces in the x - y plane .",
    "nevertheless , such deformations do not alter the plasmonic properties in a significant way as the latter mostly depends on the resonator dimensions in the plane perpendicular to light propagation ( x - y plane ) .",
    "furthermore , these artefacts are inconsistent across each sample and thus lead only to a small inhomogeneous broadening of the plasmonic resonances .",

    "the plasmonic and mo properties of the bimetallic metamaterials were simulated by a finite element method analysis with a commercial solver ( comsol ) .",
    "an infinite 2d array of resonators is assumed to be positioned on a semi - infinite glass substrate . in the presence of external magnetic fields ,",
    "the permittivity tensor of ni becomes non - diagonal  @xcite .",
    "limiting the magnetic field vector to a direction normal to the plane of the sample reduces the off - diagonal elements to only a single non - zero pair : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ( isotropic ) complex relative permittivity of the magneto - optically active material and @xmath44 is a frequency and magnetic field dependent magneto - optical parameter , obtained by interpolating values found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the faraday effect highly depends on the transmission properties of the medium , since the rotation of the polarization azimuth is expressed as the angle between the transmitted electric field component which is polarized parallel to incident radiation and the one perpendicular to it .",
    "even small differences between the experimentally and numerically obtained transmittance can lead to large discrepancies in the estimation of the faraday effect . in order to account for such effects",
    ", we normalize the amplitude of the calculated transmitted electric fields to the value we measure experimentally .",
    "hysteresis cycles of bimetallic nano - rings were simulated using oommf @xcite .",
    "additional magnetic parameters used are those commonly found in the literature for ni @xcite , magnetisation saturation is @xmath45pj / m , exchange constant is @xmath46pj / m and a maximum applied external field @xmath47 is @xmath48a / m that is perpendicular to the plane of the sample .",
    "the mesh size was @xmath49nm@xmath50 , thus allowing accurate simulations while keeping reasonable computational times .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig6 ] show a typical hysteresis curve for soft , thick magnetic films ( where perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is not present ) , though modulated due to the non - extended geometry of the ni sectors .    * experimental characterization . *",
    "the characterization of the linear optical properties for the fabricated samples was performed using a commercial microspectrometer ( craic technologies ) .",

    "the setup consists of a polarization modulator ( faraday modulator ) positioned between two crossed polarizers .",
    "the rotation can be derived by simultaneous detection locked in both the fundamental frequency and second harmonic of the modulator . for incident laser power @xmath52 , the detected signal can be described by the following equation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the rotation induced from the faraday modulator , @xmath55 is its fundamental frequency , @xmath18 is the arbitrary phase of the modulation and @xmath37 is the polarization angle rotation we want to probe .",

    "<S> this design allows to optimize the trade - off between dissipation loss ( which leads to weaker local plasmonic fields ) and the strength of the mo response , with both effects increasing for larger ni sections . </S>",
