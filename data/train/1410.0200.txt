    "in the literature there is no shortage of well - motivated candidates for cold dark matter ( dm ) particles . without going into details of their respective theoretical motivation ,",
    "it is however clear that there is more experimental work needed in the search for its ultra - light candidates below the ev regime : although different detection schemes have been proposed , only a few laboratory dark matter searches are actively searching for low - mass particles such as qcd axions , see , e.g. , recent progress of the axion dark matter experiment ( admx ) @xcite and edm - based techniques @xcite .",
    "considerations of general classes of ultra - light particles , dubbed ` weakly interacting slim particles ' ( wisps ) @xcite have shown that such particles could make up the dark matter in a rather large parameter space : particularly axion - like particles ( alps ) and massive hidden photons ( hps ) @xcite can in principle constitute all of the cold dark matter mainly through the misalignment mechanism which is also invoked for axions , see @xcite . whilst the viable parameter space for such ultra - light dark matter is likely to be further constrained from cosmological observables , ultimately laboratory experiments should be performed to have certainty on its existence .    on the experimental side , set - ups like admx are based on a _ resonant _ conversion of axions ( and wisps ) and are thus ideal to find extremely weakly coupled particles in a rather narrow mass region .",
    "this is ideal for a qcd axion dark matter search",
    ". for covering a wider mass - range , the search for alp and hp dark matter with a spherical mirror has been recently proposed @xcite : here the conversion is _ not resonantly amplified _ and thus the most immediate experimental setups are less sensitive with respect to the coupling ( but have the advantage of broad - band frequency / mass coverage ) .",
    "let us recapitulate the idea of the ` dish setup ' for hp dark matter , analogous considerations hold then for alps : the relevant term for hp dm @xmath0 is photon - to - hidden - photon coupling , parameterized by the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath1 , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it eventually leads to electromagnetic power being emitted by a conducting surface ( e.g. mirror ) at angular frequencies approximately corresponding to the hp mass , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the presence of the hp dm together with the usual requirement that for electric fields at the conducting surface @xmath3 . to first order",
    ", photons are emitted perpendicular to the surface , with small corrections stemming from directionality of the dm inflow ( which can be used to verify its dm origin ) .    to detect photons induced by this process",
    ", the advantage of using a spherical mirror is imminent : photons from far away background sources impinging on the mirror will be focused in the focal point @xmath4 whilst the dark - matter - induced photons will propagate to the center of the ` mirror sphere ' .",
    "there , a detector can be mounted .",
    "a small off - set away from the center can be understood as follows : be @xmath5 the momentum of the incoming dm , and @xmath6 the outgoing photon momentum , then @xmath7 along an infinitely extended surface because there is no boundary change ( the approximation is then valid as long as @xmath8 is much smaller then the surface diameter ) . with energy conservation @xmath9 , with normal @xmath10 to the surface . as for the dm @xmath11 , the angular off - set of the signal away from the center of the ` dish - sphere ' is @xmath12 and the off - set on the detector is @xmath13 when the detector is at center @xmath14 and @xmath15 labels directions along the surface .",
    "nicely , thus , such a setup has a directional sensitivity @xcite , which is easy to retrace within the common dm halo models .",
    "e.g. , assuming an isotropic velocity distribution of the dm with respect to the galactic frame , a global off - set of the signal on the order of @xmath16 is expected due to the movement of the sun in the galactic rest frame as well as a daily modulation on the same order of magnitude ( the yearly modulation is negligible due to the small velocity of the earth w.r.t .",
    "the sun ) . besides the signal - spot movement ,",
    "a likely velocity distribution @xmath17 of the dm leads to a broadening of the signal spot .",
    "ultimately , it is nice that this directional sensitivity can help to verify the dark matter nature of a signal .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the pierre auger observatory uses two types of mirrors ( coated glass and coated aluminum ) @xcite . both are are segmented due to their rather large overall area of @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dish ] .",
    "one prototype aluminum mirror for this experiment is kept at the karlsruhe institute for technology ( kit ) . as the mirrors are spherical with @xmath19 m",
    ", the metallic mirror is ideal for the dark matter search described above . assuming a dark matter density of @xmath20 and assuming that hps make up all of the dark matter the power emitted to the center is    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is a @xmath23-factor related to the polarization of the hps @xcite , which we have taken to be one for simplicity . as mentioned",
    ", the experimental advantage now is that the power is concentrated at the center @xmath14 of the ` mirror sphere ' , and not at the focal point @xmath4 .    as benchmark number , one would like to probe the parameter space below @xmath24 $ ] , which is the limit inferred from the xenon10 experiment @xcite , see the orange region labeled ` xenon ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : excl ] .",
    "the setup described above is sensitive to all hp masses whose associated wavelength @xmath25 can be : 1 ) detected by the sensor and 2 ) properly focused by the mirror ( here we assumed @xmath26 to use light - ray approximation and neglect diffraction , which would affect our estimates approximately below the mass range at which we cut fig .",
    "[ fig : excl ] ) .    for technological simplicity ,",
    "measurements in the visible are a good starting point , although their range is a limited . as an example , labeled ` pmt ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : excl ] , we have plotted the sensitivity range of a readily available , low - noise ( @xmath271hz ) cooled pmt with @xmath28% quantum efficiency in the ( 300 - 500)nm regime at a snr of 3 and 30h measurement time ( assuming we are noise - limited by the detector , which is conceivable in the optical ) .",
    "one can see that even this most simple and realistic setup is quickly sensitive to uncharted parameter space and with a set of pmts , the near - infrared to uv range can be explored down to @xmath29 ( the overall coverage is a bit limited in the ev - range due to the strong bounds imposed by @xcite ) .",
    "since the mirror is by default set up in a room with @xmath30(m)-thick concrete walls and further shielding can be constructed if required , measurements down to the ghz - range can be envisioned and are sensitive to larger parameter regions of hp dm .",
    "the gray regions in fig .  [ fig : excl ] indicate the exclusion set through a null - result of different qcd axion haloscopes as described in sect  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "in green and yellow , again we plot parameter space accessible in principle to our set - up , here within a few minutes in an idealized situation where we are limited by detector noise ( if the mirror has high reflectivity for the corresponding frequencies , its thermal emission should be low ) .",
    "we sketch the accessible parameter region using the dicke radiometer equation for a 25k c receiver at hand ( @xmath31ghz ) ( lighter green ) . for slightly higher frequencies we employ the noise figure provided in @xcite .",
    "one sees that even non - cryogenic options ( 300k fet , darker green ) can cover a neat section of parameter space , we also plot in lighter green the accessible region for a 15k hemt ( yellow ) .",
    "note the in the above considerations we have left out implications of directionality discussed in sect  [ sec : intro ] . in the final analysis , the data sets have to be evaluated in a particular dm model in which off - set and modulation can be computed . in summary",
    ", one sees that this rather simple setup offers many options to look for hp dark matter .",
    "[ fig : excl ] just sketches the most immediate options for this setting for good experimental conditions .",
    "if we are successful in these first steps , measurements in also in intermediate frequency ranges could be conceived . in the following months , the results of ongoing background measurements and budgetary considerations will determine our next steps .",
    "hidden photons could constitute ( part of ) dark matter . to test this possibility ,",
    "cosmological guidance and laboratory experiments are needed .",
    "a novel setup with a large metallic mirror that can probe hp masses in the @xmath32 ev - regime down to kinetic mixing values of @xmath33 is being set up at karlsruhe .",
    "this experiment can nicely complement other broadband efforts @xcite to probe even lower hp dm mass - scales with microwave cavities .    _",
