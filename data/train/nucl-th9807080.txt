    "it is well known that isospin invariance is not an exact symmetry of strong interactions . consequently , nuclear forces have a small but measurable charge - dependent component . the equality between proton - proton ( @xmath6 ) [ or neutron - neutron ( @xmath7 ) ] and neutron - proton ( @xmath8 ) nuclear interactions",
    "is known as charge independence .",
    "charge - independence breaking ( cib ) is seen most clearly in the @xmath2 nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) scattering lengths .",
    "the latest empirical values for the singlet scattering length @xmath9 and effective range @xmath10 are  @xcite : @xmath11 the values given for @xmath6 and @xmath7 scattering refer to the nuclear part of the interaction as indicated by the superscript @xmath12 .",
    "electromagnetic effects have been removed from the experimental values , which is model dependent .",
    "the uncertainties quoted for @xmath13 and @xmath14 are mainly due to this model dependence .",
    "it is useful to define the following averages : @xmath15 by definition , cib is the difference between the @xmath8 values and these averages : @xmath16 thus , the @xmath0 singlet scattering length shows a clear signature of cib in strong interactions .",
    "charge dependence of @xmath0 interactions has been the subject of extensive investigations , both experimentally and theoretically , for many decades ( for recent reviews , see refs .",
    "the current understanding is that the charge dependence of nuclear forces is due to a differences in the up and down quark masses and electromagnetic interactions . on a more phenomenological level ,",
    "major causes of cib are :    * mass splitting of isovector mesons ; particularly , @xmath4 and @xmath17 ; * irreducible pion - photon exchanges .    it has been known for a long time that the difference between the charged and neutral pion masses in the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) potential accounts for about 50% of @xmath18 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , charge dependent interactions were derived for _ np _ and _ pp _ scattering , based on a preliminary version of the bonn meson - exchange model  @xcite taking into account the pion mass difference in ope as well as two - boson exchanges . with these interactions ,",
    "about 80% of the empirical @xmath18 could be explained .",
    "earlier , ericson and miller  @xcite had obtained a very similar result using the meson - exchange model of partovi and lomon  @xcite .    the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite were performed only for the singlet scattering length .",
    "however , it is also of interest to know the charge - dependent effects for intermediate energies and in partial waves other than @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it is the main purpose of the present investigation to calculate phase shift differences between _ pp _ ( or @xmath7 ) and _ np _ scattering for states with total angular momentum j@xmath19 4 and laboratory incident kinetic energies @xmath20 300 mev .",

    "the bonn meson - exchange model for the @xmath0 interaction has been described in detail in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it is a field - theoretic model that , apart from the well - known one - boson - exchange terms , includes an explicit model for the @xmath1-exchange , @xmath21 diagrams , and some further contributions of @xmath22- and @xmath23-exchange .",
    "the bonn model yields an excellent description of the @xmath0 scattering data below pion production threshold  @xcite and , thus , provides a reliable basis for an investigation of the charge dependence of the @xmath0 interaction . within the model , charge - dependence",
    "is created by the mass difference between the charge - states of mesons .",
    "the bonn model includes three isovector mesons , namely , @xmath4 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we will focus here mainly on the charge - dependent effects due to pion mass difference .",
    "effects due to rho - mass splitting will be discussed briefly at the end of this section , and mass splitting of the @xmath25 will be ignored since nothing is known .",
    "we use averages for the baryon masses : the average nucleon mass @xmath26 mev and the average @xmath27-mass @xmath28 mev .",
    "the pion masses are @xmath29 the values are based upon the 1992 review of particle properties  @xcite .",
    "the interaction lagrangians involving pions are @xmath30 with @xmath31 the nucleon , @xmath32 the @xmath27 ( rarita - schwinger spinor ) , and @xmath33 the pion fields .",

    ", we always use @xmath36 as scaling mass .",
    "it may be tempting to use @xmath38 for @xmath39 coupling .",
    "notice , however , that the scaling mass could be anything .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to keep the scaling mass constant within su(3 ) multiplets  @xcite .",
    "this avoids the creation of unmotivated cib .    in our investigation of charge - dependent effects on the @xmath0 interaction ,",
    "we start from a case that may be denoted the average between @xmath6 and @xmath7 scattering . for this case ,",
    "our model yields @xmath40 fm for the singlet scattering length and 2.864 fm for the effective range , consistent with eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the one - pion - exchange contribution for this average case is depicted in fig .",
    "1a and @xmath1-exchange contributions are shown in fig .",
    "2a , 3a , and 4a .",
    "note that , in this case , the proton ` p ' in figs .",
    "1a to 4a carries the average nucleon mass of 938.919 mev and there are no electromagnetic interactions ; equally well , one may use a neutron ` n ' in place of the proton in part ( a ) of all figures .    to calculate the effects of charge dependence on the @xmath0 phase shifts , we introduce for each @xmath41 state the cib phase shift difference @xmath42 , defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the average of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 phase shifts which",
    ", as discussed , is calculated by taking the diagrams figs .",
    "1a to 4a into account ( besides the other diagrams involved in the bonn model ) with average nucleon mass and all electromagnetic interactions switched off .",
    "the phase shift @xmath45 is the @xmath8 one to be calculated below .",
    "similarly , we define the cib mixing parameter difference @xmath46 , @xmath47    the charge - dependence generated by the model under consideration is now ` switched on ' step by step :    1 .   * one - pion - exchange * ( ope ) , fig .  1 :",
    "the cib effect is created by replacing the diagram of fig .",
    "1a by the two diagrams of fig .",
    "note that one - meson - exchange contributions are roughly proportional to 1/@xmath48 ( with @xmath49 the meson mass ) because this is approximately the momentum - space one - meson propagator for very low momentum transfer .",
    "thus , since the @xmath39 has a smaller mass than the @xmath50 , @xmath39 exchange is stronger than @xmath50 exchange .",
    "for this reason , ope is stronger in @xmath6 as compared to @xmath8 .",
    "since ope is repulsive in @xmath2 , this phase shift becomes more attractive ( i.  e. , larger ) when going from @xmath6 to @xmath8 , resulting in a positive @xmath51 ; cf .",
    "column ` ope ' in table  i and dashed curve in fig .",
    "consistent with this is the well - known fact that ope takes care of about 50% of @xmath18 . in the other partial waves , the sign of @xmath51 due to ope depends on",
    "if ope is repulsive or attractive ( e.  g. , it is repulsive in @xmath52 and attractive in @xmath53 and @xmath5 ) . due to the small mass of the pion",
    ", ope is a sizable contribution in all partial waves including higher partial waves ; and due to the pion s relatively large mass splitting ( 3.4% ) , ope creates relatively large charge - dependent effects in all partial waves ( fig .  5 and table  i ) .",
    "* @xmath1-exchange with @xmath0 intermediate states * ( @xmath54 ) , fig  2 : notice first that only non - iterative ( irreducible ) diagrams are to be considered , since the iterative ones are generated by the scattering equation from ope .",
    "we mention here that , in our approach which is based upon time - ordered perturbation theory , we always take all time - orderings into account ( except for those that imply anti - baryons in intermediate states ) ; however , to save space , we display only a few characteristic time - orderings in fig .  2 ( this is also true for all diagrams shown in figs .  3 and 4 ; to get an impression of the total number of time - ordered diagrams , see fig .",
    "20 of ref .",
    "the cib effect is obtained by replacing the diagrams fig .",
    "2a ( @xmath6/@xmath7 scattering ) by those of fig .",
    "2b ( @xmath8 scattering ) .",
    "for a good understanding of cib effects , it is important to distinguish between box ( here : stretched box ) and crossed box diagrams .",
    "concerning the effect from stretched box diagrams , one replaces the left diagram of fig .",
    "2a by the four stretched box diagrams of fig .",
    "2b ( and similarly for the other stretched box time - orderings not shown ) .",
    "notice now that in the former diagram two @xmath39 are exchanged making this a ` strong ' diagram , while the latter four diagrams together with their isospin factors result in a weaker contribution .",
    "since 2@xmath4 exchange is , in general , attractive , there is a loss of attraction when going from @xmath6 to @xmath8 ( equivalent to a reduction of the phase shift ) .",
    "this qualitative estimate is clearly confirmed by the quantitative results displayed in column ` @xmath55 ' of table  ii . the cib effect that stems from crossed box diagrams",
    "is obtained by replacing the two crossed boxes of fig .",
    "2a by the three crossed boxes of fig .",
    "2b . typically , this effect ( column ` @xmath56 ' of table  ii ) is of opposite sign as compared to the corresponding ( stretched ) box effect , in most partial waves .",
    "the total cib effect from all diagrams of fig .",
    "2 is displayed by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "* @xmath1-exchange with n@xmath27 intermediate states * ( @xmath57 ) , fig .  3 : notice again , that every box stands for all possible time - orderings of the box type ( diagrams 1 to 6 of fig",
    ".  20 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and every crossed box for all possible time - orderings of the crossed box type ( diagrams 7 to 12 of fig .",
    "20 of ref .",
    "thus , the total number of diagrams which fig .",

    "replacement of the boxes fig .",
    "3a by the boxes fig .",
    "3b causes an increase in the strength of these diagrams which , since these are attractive diagrams , causes an increase in attraction .",
    "column ` @xmath58 ' in table  ii clearly confirms this . for the crossed boxes one gets typically the opposite effect ( column ` @xmath59 ' of table  ii ) .",
    "this partial cancelation of the effects from the two groups of diagrams is also demonstrated in fig .",
    "6 where the dash - dot curve represents the effect from the box diagrams while the dash - triple - dot curve is from the crossed ones .",
    "notice that the cancelation is almost perfect in @xmath2 and @xmath5 even though the individual contributions are rather large .",
    "* @xmath1-exchange with @xmath60 intermediate states * ( @xmath61 ) , fig .  4 : the replacement of the diagrams of fig .",
    "4a by fig .",
    "4b shows the by now familiar characteristic : opposite effects from box and crossed box diagrams ( column ` @xmath62 ' and ` @xmath63 ' of table  ii ) .",
    "this results in large cancelations between effects which , due to the short - range nature of this class of diagrams , are individually already rather small .",
    "this explains why the cib effect from the diagrams of fig .",
    "4 is negligible in most partial waves ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "+ this finishes the discussion of all contributions of the @xmath1 type . in summary",
    ", one can say that the total cib effect from @xmath1 ( dash - dot curve in fig .",
    "5 ) is quite noticable up to the @xmath64-state . in @xmath2 , @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath65 ,",
    "the cib effect from @xmath1 is 20 - 50% of the one from ope , at 300 mev .",
    "however , for low energies ( except in @xmath2 ) as well as in higher partial waves , the cib @xmath1 effect is negligible .",
    "* @xmath21-exchanges .",
    "* this group is , in principal , as comprehensive as the @xmath1-exchanges discussed above .",
    "graphically , the @xmath21 diagrams can be obtained by replacing in each diagram of figs .  24 , one of the two pions by a @xmath17-meson of the same charge - state ( because of this simple analogy",
    ", we do not show the @xmath21 diagrams explicitly here ) . concerning the @xmath21 diagrams with @xmath27 intermediate states",
    "a comment is in place . in the bonn model  @xcite ,",
    "the crossed @xmath21 diagrams with @xmath66 and @xmath60 intermediate states are included in terms of an approximation .",
    "it is assumed that they differ from the corresponding box diagrams only by the isospin factor .",
    "thus , the @xmath21 box diagrams with @xmath66 and @xmath60 intermediate states are multiplied by an isospin factor that is equal to the sum of the isospin factors for box and crossed box . in this approximation",
    ", these diagrams do not generate any cib effects due to pion - mass splitting . since these diagrams are of very short range , their cib effect may be negligible , anyhow .",
    "the only class of @xmath21 diagrams which we include in our calculation of cib effects is the one that corresponds to fig .  2 , with one pion in each diagram replaced by a @xmath17 meson .",
    "its contribution to cib ( column @xmath21 of table  i and dash - triple - dot curve of fig .",
    "5 ) is generally small , and typically opposite to the one from @xmath1 , in most states .",
    "* further @xmath22 and @xmath23 contributions * ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the bonn potential also includes some @xmath22-exchanges that can be approximated in terms of @xmath68 diagrams and @xmath23-exchanges of @xmath69 type .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the sum of these contributions is small .",
    "these diagrams have @xmath0 intermediate states ",
    "similar to fig .  2 , but with one of the two exchanged pions replaced by an isospin - zero boson",
    "; thus , the isospin factors are different from the ones of fig .  2 and , in fact , like the ones of fig .  1 .",
    "another way of creating these diagrams is to combine the diagrams of fig .  1 with a sigma or an omega in an irreducible way , i.  e. , by forming a stretched box or crossed box diagram .",
    "these diagrams carry the same isospin factors as ope .",
    "since this class of diagrams is part of the bonn model , we include these diagrams in our cib consideration .",
    "the cib effect from this class is very small , except in @xmath2 , @xmath52 , and @xmath5 ( column ` @xmath70 ' of table  i and dotted curve in fig .  5 ) .",
    "this effect has always the same sign as the effect from ope , but it is substantially smaller .",
    "the reason for the ope character of this contribution is that @xmath68 prevails over @xmath69 and , thus , determines the character of this contribution .",
    "since sigma - exchange is negative and since , futhermore , the propagator in between the @xmath4 and the @xmath71 exchange is also negative , the overall sign of the @xmath68 exchange is the same as ope .",
    "thus , it is like a weak , short - ranged ope .",
    "this finishes our detailed presentation of the diagrams and their cib effects included in our calculation .",
    "the sum of all cib effects on phase shifts is given in the last column of table  i and plotted by the solid curve in fig .",
    "notice that the difference between the solid curve and the dashed curve ( ope ) in fig .",
    "5 represents the sum of all effects beyond ope .",
    "thus , it is clearly seen that ope dominates the cib effect in all partial waves , even though there are substantial contributions besides ope in some states , notably @xmath2 , @xmath52 , and @xmath65 .    finally , in table iii and iv",
    ", we also give the cib contributions to the @xmath2 scattering length and effective range .",
    "note that the relationship between the cib potential and the corresponding change of the scattering length , @xmath18 , is highly non - linear . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , when the scattering length changes from @xmath72 to @xmath73 due to a cib potential @xmath74 , the relationship is @xmath75 or @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 the zero - energy @xmath2 wave functions normalized such that @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the perturbation expansion concerns the invers scattering length . as clearly evident from eq .",
    "( 12 ) , the change of the scattering length depends on the `` starting value '' @xmath72 to which the effect is added . in our calculations ,",
    "cib effects are generated step by step , which implies that the starting value @xmath72 is different for each cib effect .",
    "this distorts the relative size of different cib contributions to the scattering length difference . to make the relative comparison meaningful",
    ", we have rescaled our results for @xmath18 according to a prescription given by ericson and miller  @xcite , which goes as follows .",
    "assume the `` starting value '' for the scattering length is @xmath72 and a certain cib effect brings it up to @xmath73 .",
    "then , the resulting scattering length difference @xmath80 is rescaled by @xmath81 with @xmath82 fm and @xmath83 fm . this will make @xmath84 independent of the choice for @xmath72 .",
    "the numbers given in table iii and iv for @xmath18 are all rescaled according to eq .",
    "( 13 ) .",
    "we obtain a total @xmath18 of 4.65 fm which is about 80% of the empirical value of 5.7 fm [ eq .",
    "( 4 ) ] . for @xmath85",
    "we find a total of 0.115 fm from all effects , consistent with the empirical value [ eq .",
    "( 5 ) ] . even though our total result for @xmath18 is very similar to the earlier calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , there are some differences in the details . for the total effect from @xmath1-exchange we obtain in the present calculations @xmath86 fm while in ref .",
    "@xcite 0.85 fm was reported .",
    "this is due to differences in the interpretation of the scaling mass that occurs in the @xmath87 lagrangian , eq .",
    "( 8) . while in the present calculations we always use @xmath36",
    "[ see discussion below eq .",
    "( 8) ] , in the earlier calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath38 was used for @xmath39 coupling and @xmath36 for @xmath50 coupling .",
    "the latter convention introduces a strong charge - dependence of the effective @xmath87 coupling strength , which enhances the cib effects from all diagrams involving @xmath27-isobars . in principal",
    ", there is discretion in how to deal with the scaling mass in eq .",
    "however , in the present calculations , we decided to follow the established convention  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the effect from @xmath1-exchange is smaller than in the earlier calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is also a small difference in the @xmath18 contribution from non - iterative @xmath68 and @xmath69 exchanges for which we obtain 1.4 fm while ref  @xcite reported 1.2 fm .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite a preliminary version of the bonn full model @xcite was used , while here we applied the final version @xcite in which the strength of the @xmath68 contribution is slightly larger , which explains the difference .",
    "we note that the cib effect depends on the @xmath88 coupling constant . in the present calculations ,",
    "we follow the bonn model  @xcite : we assume charge - independence of the coupling constant and use @xmath89  @xcite . in recent years , there has been some controversy about the precise value of the @xmath88 coupling constant . unfortunately",
    ", the problem is far from being settled .",
    "based upon @xmath0 phase shift analysis , the nijmegen group  @xcite advocates the ` small ' charge - independent value @xmath90 , while a very recent determination by the uppsala group  @xcite based upon high precision @xmath8 charge - exchange data at 162 mev resulted in the ` large ' value @xmath91 .",
    "other recent determinations are in - between the two extremes : the vpi group  @xcite quotes @xmath92 from @xmath93 and @xmath0 analysis with no evidence for charge - dependence .",
    "bugg and machleidt  @xcite obtain @xmath94 and @xmath95 from the analysis of @xmath0 elastic data between 210 and 800 mev .",
    "because of this large uncertainty in the @xmath88 coupling constant , it might be of interest to know what the cib effects are like when a value is used that deviates substantially from our choice . for that reason",
    ", we have repeated our cib calculations with the smaller values @xmath96 and 13.6 .",
    "it turns out that the total cib effect on phase shifts ( last column of table i ) as well as the effect on the effective range parameters ( table iii ) scales linearly with the @xmath88 coupling constant , to a good approximation . to be precise : multiplying the total phase shift differences in table i or the effective range changes in table iii with 13.6/14.4 reproduces within @xmath97% the exact results from a cib calculation that employes @xmath98 .    as last item in our study",
    ", we have also investigated the effect of rho - mass splitting on the @xmath2 effective range parameters .",
    "unfortunately , the evidence for rho - mass splitting is very uncertain , with the particle data group  @xcite reporting @xmath99 mev .",
    "consistent with this , we assumed in our exploratory study @xmath100 mev and @xmath101 mev , i.  e. , a splitting of 1 mev . with this , we find @xmath102 fm from one - rho - exchange , and @xmath103 fm from the non - iterative @xmath21 diagrams with @xmath0 intermediate states .",
    "thus , individual effects are small and , in addition , there are substantial cancellations between the two classes of diagrams that contribute .",
    "the net result is a vanishing effect .",
    "thus , even if the rho - mass splitting will be better determined in the future and may turn out to be larger than our assumption , it will never be a great source of cib .",
    "based upon the bonn meson - exchange model for the @xmath0 interaction , we have calulated the cib effects due to pion - mass splitting on the singlet effective range parameters and on the phase shifts of @xmath0 scattering for partial waves of total angular momentum @xmath104 and laboratory energies below 300 mev .",
    "this investigation complements our recent paper on charge - asymmetry of the @xmath0 interaction  @xcite .",
    "the largest phase shift differences occur in the @xmath2 state where they are most noticable at low energy ;",
    "e.  g. , at 1 mev , the difference is 4.36@xmath105 , indicating that the _ np _ nuclear force is more attractive than the _ pp _ nuclear force .",
    "the @xmath2 phase shift difference decreases with increasing energy and is about 0.6@xmath105 at 300 mev .",
    "the major part of the phase shift difference comes from ope .",
    "cib contributions from two - meson exchange diagrams can be large , but there are typically cancelations between the effects from different classes of diagrams of the two - meson type .",
    "the cib effect on the phase shifts of @xmath106 and higher partial waves is generally small .",
    "the most significant difference is found in the @xmath53 state around 50 mev where the difference is almost 1 degree . in @xmath106-waves ,",
    "the difference is roughly constant above 25 mev : it is 0.95 - 0.65@xmath105 in @xmath53 , about 0.35@xmath105 in @xmath52 , and around 0.2@xmath105 in @xmath5 . in all other partial waves ,",
    "it is in the order of 0.1@xmath105 or less .",
    "again , the main effect comes from ope , however , in @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath65 at 300 mev , the effect from the @xmath1 model is in the range of 20 - 50% of the one from ope .",
    "the fact that the magnitudes of the phase shift differences in all partial waves , except @xmath2 , are small , makes it difficult to verify experimentally the charge dependent effects in @xmath106 and higher partial waves .",
    "however , since the phase shifts in these states themselves are small , the relative magnitudes of the phase shift differences are not negligible and could have a noticable effect on some sensitive observables such as the analyzing power ( @xmath107 ) in nucleon - deuteron ( @xmath108 ) scattering  @xcite since this reaction blows up effects from triplet @xmath106 waves  @xcite .",
    "our microscopic predictions are , however , substantially smaller than what is needed to solve the @xmath108 @xmath107 puzzle  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , another cib contribution to the nuclear force is irreducible pion - photon ( @xmath109 ) exchange .",
    "traditionally , it was believed that this contribution would take care of the remaining 20% of @xmath18  @xcite . however",
    ", a recently derived @xmath109 potential based upon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite _ decreases _ @xmath18 by about 0.6 fm , making the discrepancy even larger .",
    "thus , we are faced with the fact that about 20 - 30% of the charge - dependence of the singlet scattering length is not explained .    in recent years",
    ", nuclear physicists have become increasingly concerned with chiral symmetry which is an approximate symmetry of qcd in the light - quark sector . in the light of these new views , the @xmath0 interaction should have a clear relationship with chiral symmetry .",
    "the bonn model that our investigation in based upon is , by construction , not a consistently chiral model .",
    "chiral models for the @xmath0 interaction and , in particular , chiral models for the @xmath1 exchange have recently been constructed by various groups  @xcite . however , most of these models are applicable only for the peripheral partial waves of @xmath0 scattering and not for @xmath110 , @xmath106 , or @xmath64 waves ; and if there are predictions for lower partial waves , they are only of qualitative nature . the cib effects in @xmath110 and @xmath106 waves and , particularly , for the singlet scattering length are very subtle and , therefore , require a quantitative model .",
    "thus , current chiral models for the @xmath1 exchange are not ( yet ) suitable for reliable calculations of cib .",
    "one may then raise an interesting question : what has to be changed in the bonn model to make it chiral ?",
    "this question can be answered precisely .",
    "the diagrams in figs .  2 ( a ) and ( b ) of ref .",
    "@xcite have to be added to the bonn model ; that is essentially all .",
    "these diagrams include the weinberg - tomozawa @xmath111 vertex which is a characteristic ingredient of any nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "however , it has been found independently by different groups  @xcite that the @xmath1 exchange diagrams which include the weinberg - tomozawa vertex make a very small , essentially negligible , contribution to the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "one may then expect that the cib caused by these diagrams is also very small  @xcite .",
    "thus , there are reasons to believe that the results of this study may be of broader relevance than what the ( formally ) non - chiral character of our model suggests . of course",
    ", the final and reliable answer of the question under consideration can only come from a ` perfect ' and quantitative chiral model for the @xmath0 interaction that is applicable also in @xmath110 waves and for the calculation of scattering lengths . in view of the problems raised concerning scattering length calculations with chiral models  @xcite and in view of the continuing general controversy concerning cutoff _ versus _ dimensional regularization , it will take many years until a reliable calculation of this kind can be done .",
    "thus , for the time being , it may be comforting to have at least our present results .",
