    "the structure of light exotic isotopes is currently one of the major topics in nuclear physics .",

    "the coulomb interaction leads to proton unbound states in neutron - deficient nuclei even though the corresponding states are bound in the mirror nuclei .",
    "decay properties of these nuclei yield additional information about their structure as well as the structure of states in the mirror nuclei .",
    "one such example is @xmath0na , a proton drip - line isotope which is unbound with respect to proton emission by only 321 kev .",
    "it was first observed by cerny et al .",
    "@xcite and until very recently only its mass and the excitation energy of its first excited state were experimentally known .",
    "the lack of experimental information on the level structure of @xmath0na is due to technical difficulties related to the population of the excited states of this rather exotic nucleus with three fewer neutrons than the stable sodium isotope @xmath4na .",
    "the second excited state in @xmath0na was recently observed in a @xmath1ne+p elastic scattering experiment @xcite in which a narrow excitation energy range ( 0.4 - 1.1 mev ) was covered .",
    "the original goal of this work was to extend our knowledge of the structure of @xmath0na to higher excitation energies ( up to 2.7 mev ) using the resonance elastic scattering of a radioactive beam of @xmath1ne on protons ( the upper limit in excitation energy is implied by the maximum possible energy of @xmath1ne beam that can be produced at isnap @xcite ) . during the review stage of this manuscript new study of the @xmath0na nucleus",
    "was published from the study at spiral ( ganil ) by oliveira et al . @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0na was measured up to excitation energy of 5.7 mev at one angle ( 180@xmath5 ) using the thick target inverse kinematics ( ttik ) technique @xcite .",
    "two additional resonances at higher excitation energies were found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , two broad peaks at @xmath6 2.4 and 3.1 mev were observed .",
    "it was pointed out by the authors in @xcite that these peaks can originate from process other than elastic scattering .",
    "the first peak is in the energy range of our experiment and should be populated if the origin of this peak is in fact related to elastic scattering .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to compare our data , obtained at a lower beam energy and different angles with the data from @xcite .",
    "the structure of low lying resonances in @xmath0na also has some astrophysical interest .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that at certain stellar temperature and density conditions two - proton capture reaction on @xmath1ne can play an important role in bridging the waiting point nucleus @xmath1ne and provide continuous flow between the cno and the fe - ni mass region in the _ rp _ -process .",
    "the @xmath1ne(2p,@xmath3 ) reaction rate was recalculated taking into account new information on the excitation energy of the second excited state .    in the following sections , we present the results of resonance elastic scattering of @xmath1ne on protons , discuss the structure of the @xmath0na nucleus , and finally discuss the influence of a @xmath7 state on two - proton capture reaction rate on the @xmath1ne nucleus .",

    "three si detectors placed at angles of 7.5@xmath5 , 22.5@xmath5 and 37.5@xmath5 with respect to the beam axis ( corresponding to backward angles for elastic scattering of @xmath1ne on protons ) were used to detect recoil protons .",

    "the 5.6 m distance from the primary target to the array of silicon detectors was adequate to obtain a clean separation of the protons associated with the interaction of @xmath1ne ions in the target from protons associated with elastic scattering of beam contaminants and reactions of other beam isotopes in the target ( see fig .",

    "the width of the states calculated with the proper potential can then be compared with the experimental values and the spectroscopic factor can be extracted as the ratio of experimental width to the calculated value ( as long as only one decay channel is open , as is the case in the energy region of interest ) .",

    "the ratio of the experimental to the calculated width gives the spectroscopic factor , which is greater than one for both @xmath26o and @xmath26f . to avoid this",
    ", we could increase the diffuseness of the potential ( as it was suggested in @xcite ) to get sf=1.0 for 3/2@xmath27 instead of 1.25 .",
    "but since we want to keep all potential parameters the same for @xmath26o/@xmath26f and @xmath0o/@xmath0na ( except v@xmath28 ) , we decided to use standard values .",
    "a potential with the same woods ",
    "saxon parameters ( except for v@xmath28 parameter ) was used to calculate the widths and excitation energies of the single particle states in @xmath0o .",
    "the potential was adjusted to fit the position of the first 1/2@xmath2 state in @xmath0o which has pure single particle structure @xcite ( see table [ tab : levels ] ) .",
    "the excitation energy of the other pure single particle state ( 3/2@xmath2at 5.45 mev ) was reproduced by this potential with an accuracy of 40 kev .",

    "the ground state of @xmath0o appears to be underbound by 500 kev , but it is known from shell model calculations @xcite and also from experiment @xcite that the @xmath0o ground state has significant admixtures from configurations other than simple ( @xmath29)@xmath8 for the neutrons in excess of _ n _ = 8 .",
    "thus , our potential model is not adequate for a description of the ground state of @xmath0o .",
    "the potential obtained in the procedure described above can now be used to calculate the single - particle width of the 1/2@xmath2 state in @xmath0na .",
    "it was found that the predicted width of this state is 134 kev , in comparison with the experimental value of 130 @xmath22 50 kev gives a clear indication that it is a pure single particle state ( sf = 0.95 @xmath22 0.3 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic factor defined in this way is in very good agreement with the result of csm which gives 70% sf and a width for the 1/2@xmath27 resonance in @xmath0na of about 94 kev ( obtained as follows : the single particle width from potential model was multiplied by sf given by csm ) .",

    "the fit to the data from @xcite and our potential model gives a spectroscopic factor of 0.75 @xmath22 0.06 .",
    "the error reflects the statistical uncertainty of the data from @xcite .",
    "the state observed at 2.37 mev in @xmath0o does not manifest itself in the measured excitation function .",
    "nevertheless , conclusions can be drawn from the fact that we did not see any indications of the presence of this state in our data .",
    "specifically , this state is either very narrow and/or only weakly populated in the elastic channel .",
    "the csm calculations indicate that the third excited state of @xmath0o/@xmath0na , is built predominantly on the first and the second excited states of @xmath1o/@xmath1ne , and has a spin - parity of 9/2@xmath2 .",
    "the width of this state in @xmath0na , according to the csm prediction @xcite is 1.1 ev .",
    "however , this model does not take into account possible admixtures from @xmath41 shell ( only sd shell is included ) .",
    "the single - particle width of this state calculated with the potential given in table [ tab : levels ] is 0.5 kev .",
    "so even if we assume the @xmath42 admixture of the @xmath41 shell to the wave function of this state the width would become @xmath43 5 ev . much too narrow to be measured in the present work .",
    "hence , the absence of the state around 2.4 mev ( excitation energy ) in the observed @xmath1ne+p spectrum lends indirect support to the prediction of the csm regarding the nature of this state .    in @xcite ,",
    "two peaks with cross sections of @xmath24 300 mb / sr were observed at cm energies of 2.4 and 3.1 mev in the excitation function of @xmath1ne+p elastic scattering .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : exfun ] no peak is present at 2.4 mev in our spectrum .",
    "it is a clear experimental proof that peaks observed in @xcite are not related to the @xmath0na states populated in elastic scattering .",
    "authors of @xcite argue that these peaks can be related to the sequential 2p - decay of the highly excited states of @xmath0na .",
    "absence of these peaks in our spectrum lends indirect support to this hypothesis because due to lower initial @xmath1ne beam energy in our experiment these highly excited states would not be populated and thus the peaks at 2.4 mev and 3.1 mev can not be observed .    potential model with potential parameters given in table [ tab : levels ] reproduces excitation energies ( with 100 kev accuracy ) and widths of all states of single particle nature in @xmath26f , @xmath26o and @xmath0o .",

    "using this model one can make a prediction for the excitation energy and width of the 3/2@xmath27 ( 1d3/2)@xmath44 single particle state in @xmath0na . according to our calculations",
    "it should have an excitation energy of 5.2 mev and width of @xmath43 2 mev .",
    "this state is the analog of the known 5.45 mev 3/2@xmath27 single particle state in @xmath0o @xcite .",
    "it is also a feature of both csm calculations @xcite and shell - model calculation using code oxbash @xcite with the wbt @xcite interactions where it appears at 5.53 mev .",
    "thus this state should clearly be in accessible range of @xcite where the excitation function was measured up to 5.7 mev .",
    "however , we saw no indication of this state",
    ". it would be of great interest to locate this state in @xmath0na in future measurements or understand the reason for its disappearance .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for high temperature and density conditions , two - proton capture on @xmath1ne will compete with @xmath45 and @xmath46 decay rate .",
    "such stellar condition would allow a fast depletion of @xmath1ne and a fast leakage out of the hot cno cycle toward higher masses . in @xcite ,",
    "the second excited state @xmath47 + in the @xmath0na nucleus , was not known .",
    "the position of the @xmath47 + state was estimated from thomas  ehrman shift relative to the mirror @xmath38 state in @xmath0o and the value @xmath21 = 0.353 mev was used .",
    "it is more than two times lower than the experimental value obtained by us and as a result some changes in reaction rates may occurs .",
    "we recalculated the @xmath1ne(2p,@xmath3 ) reaction rate for the same stellar conditions as in @xcite .",
    "for the case discussed here , the approach proposed in @xcite can be used . using the obtained energy of the @xmath38 state , the @xmath1ne(2p,@xmath3 ) reaction rate was reduced by a factor of 100 due to the new location of the 1/2@xmath27 resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : astro ] , the ordinate represents total two proton reaction rate on @xmath1ne ) .",

    ", it would be very narrow and only weakly populated in elastic scattering .",
    "we did not observe a broad peak at 2.4 mev , found in @xcite , which indicates that this peak is unrelated to elastic scattering and may be the result of sequential 2p decay from the higher lying excited states of @xmath0na ( as argued in @xcite ) .",
