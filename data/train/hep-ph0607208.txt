    "the hierarchy problem , unification of fundamental interactions , and fermion mass puzzle are some of the main motivations for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in particular , if we believe in unification of electroweak and strong interactions then the so - called grand unified theories ( guts ) represent the most natural extensions of the standard model .    the first grand unified theory ",
    "the georgi - glashow @xmath0 model  @xcite  was introduced in 1974 . in that model",
    "each generation of the sm matter is unified in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 dimensional representations , and the minimal higgs sector is composed of two representations : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the georgi - glashow model is arguably the simplest gut .",
    "it is very predictive but it is certainly not realistic .",
    "namely , one can not unify the sm gauge couplings at the high scale , the neutrinos are massless , and a high - scale unification of yukawa couplings of the down quarks and charged leptons contradicts experimental findings for the masses of those particles .    since the simplest @xmath0 gut is not realistic it requires appropriate modifications .",
    "there is a number of ways of doing that , but in order to preserve the predictivity of the theory those modifications should be minimal . with this in mind we have proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite the simplest possible extension of the georgi - glashow model that is in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "phenomenological and cosmological aspects of our proposal have been analyzed subsequently in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we study in detail the yukawa sector within the proposed framework , and define the upper bound on the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath2 of the theory from the constraints imposed by proton decay lifetime measurements .",
    "we show that this uv cutoff depends on the absolute value of the tau lepton yukawa coupling at the unification scale and not on the difference of the bottom quark to the tau lepton yukawa couplings , as expected from bottom - tau unification .",
    "we find @xmath8gev .",
    "furthermore , as an essential ingredient in our study we perform an up - to - date analysis of all the fermion masses at the electroweak scale .",
    "these values are especially relevant for numerical studies of viability of various gut models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the minimal realistic extension of the georgi - glashow ( gg ) model . in section",
    "iii the predictions for yukawa couplings at the unification scale are investigated .",
    "there we also list updated values of all the fermion masses at the electroweak scale .",
    "the uv cutoff of the theory is defined and evaluated in section iv .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal realistic non - supersymmetric @xmath0 model  @xcite is composed of the fields @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , while the matter content remains the same as in the gg model .",
    "here we use the sm ( @xmath12 ) decomposition to set our notation .",
    "the lagrangian of our model includes all possible terms invariant under the @xmath0 gauge symmetry , and accordingly includes higher - dimensional operators in order to write a consistent relation between fermion masses .",
    "( influence of higher - dimensional operators on gauge coupling constants  @xcite is assumed to be negligible . )",
    "the role of the @xmath13 dimensional higgs is twofold : it generates neutrino masses through a type ii see - saw mechanism  @xcite , and contributes to the unification of gauge couplings .",
    "the possibility to achieve unification in the present context has been investigated in ref .",
    "there we showed that there are only three fields which can help to achieve successful unification",
    ". those are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] the appropriate parameter space that generates successful unification of gauge couplings at one - loop .",
    "it corresponds to the region bounded by the lines of constant @xmath17gev , @xmath18gev , and @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the maximal value of @xmath20 at the two - loop level is somewhat larger than the one that corresponds to the benchmark point p1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] .",
    "namely , @xmath21gev for @xmath22 , @xmath23gev , @xmath18gev and @xmath24 . with this set of values",
    "we can establish an accurate upper bound on the proton decay lifetime . in a model independent way the proton lifetime @xmath25 is bounded by the inequality  @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the matrix element , and @xmath28 is a common mass of gauge bosons responsible for proton decay . for our purposes we set @xmath29gev@xmath30  @xcite and identify @xmath31 .",
    "( the main source of uncertainty in eq",
    ".   comes from the matrix element @xmath27 .",
    "for an up - to - date discussion on @xmath27 see  @xcite . for",
    "a review on proton stability see  @xcite . )",
    "using the two - loop values of @xmath32 and @xmath20 mentioned above we find @xmath33years  @xcite .",
    "clearly , our model could be tested or ruled out at the next generation of proton decay experiments  @xcite .",
    "conversely , one can invert eq .   to establish a lower limit on the gut scale ; recall , @xmath34 .",
    "if we take @xmath35years  @xcite as experimental input , and assume @xmath36 the region below @xmath37gev is excluded by proton decay .",
    "this limit defines our benchmark point p3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] .",
    "once we impose proton decay constraints on @xmath20 we also get an upper bound on the scalar leptoquark mass from the benchmark point p3 : @xmath38gev .",
    "in addition , if we consider the most natural implementation of the type ii see - saw mechanism ( large @xmath39 ) the mass of the scalar leptoquark @xmath40 comes out in the phenomenologically interesting region @xmath41  gev .",
    "we have analyzed the unification scenario at three benchmark points p1 through p3 showed in fig .  [ fig : triangle ] . as we explained , these three points define the limits of the parameter space that yields unification of gauge couplings in the minimal realistic @xmath0 model at one - loop .",
    "the particle content of the model also implies that the gauge coupling exhibits asymptotically free behavior between the gut scale and the cutoff @xmath2 .",
    "this feature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauge ] for the benchmark point p1 .",
    "the value of @xmath32 at the scale @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is given by : @xmath44 . in order to make any specific statements about the behavior of the gauge coupling at and above the cutoff the full structure of the more fundamental theory that represents the ultraviolet completion of our model needs to be specified .",
    "as we comment towards the end , there exists well - defined underlying theory that reproduces our model below the cutoff @xmath2 which also supports the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0 gauge coupling up to the planck scale .",
    "we have also shown that the minimal realistic @xmath0 predicts the existence of light fields . in the benchmark point",
    "p1 the higgs field @xmath45 and the scalar leptoquark @xmath40 are very light , while in the benchmark point p2 the lightest fields are @xmath46 and @xmath40 .",
    "finally in the benchmark point p3 there are two light higgses @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "we can conclude then that the minimal realistic non - supersymmetric @xmath0 model could be potentially tested at the next generation of collider experiments , particularly at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern . the possibility to explain the baryon - asymmetry in the universe in this context has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the possibility of probing second and third generation leptoquark parameter space with the icecube neutrino detection facility .",
    "since in principle all those fields could modify the predictions for the yukawa couplings at the unification scale we will study their effect in the next section .",
    "we shall investigate predictions for fermion masses in the framework of the minimal realistic @xmath0 model .",
    "the rges for the yukawa couplings are summarized in appendix b. in order to compute the values of the yukawa couplings at the gut scale we need accurate values for the fermion masses at the electroweak scale as initial conditions for the rges . as a first approximation it is sufficient to consider the third generation only , and neglect the yukawa couplings of the first and second generations in the rge evolution . for future applications however we shall update the values of the fermion masses at the @xmath47 scale for all the three generations .    as input value for the top quark mass",
    "we take the latest world average from the tevatron electroweak working group  @xcite , and extract the top quark running mass assuming that this value corresponds to the pole mass : = 1 + + 10.95 ( ) ^2 + o(_s^3 )  . for the bottom quark mass we will adopt a conservative value at low energies @xmath48  gev .",
    "this value is compatible through qcd evolution with the experimental measurement at higher energies  @xcite , and agrees with most of the low energy determinations  @xcite .",
    "then , to obtain the initial conditions for the top and the bottom quark masses are evolved to the @xmath47 scale at three - loops  @xcite with @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "we also extract the values of the other quarks from the pdg  @xcite and calculate them at @xmath47 using three - loop rge evolution in qcd accounting for the matching conditions over the heavy quark thresholds  @xcite .",
    "the physical lepton masses are taken also from the pdg  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding running masses are calculated at the @xmath47 scale though the relation : m_l(m_z ) = m_l + o(^2 )  , with @xmath50 .",
    "the input values for all the fermion masses and the corresponding values at the electroweak scale are summarized in table  [ tab : input ] .",
    "these values at @xmath47 substantially defer and represent better reflection of our current knowledge of fermion masses from the values first evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite and later updated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".[tab : input ] input parameters for the fermion masses and their values at the @xmath47 scale .",
    "capital @xmath42 denotes pole masses , while @xmath51 are running masses . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we briefly investigate how our analysis holds at the two - loop level . in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] , we show our results for the scenario which corresponds to the benchmark point p1 . to insure the proper inclusion of boundary conditions  @xcite at @xmath20 we set @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "( in addition to the central values given in table  [ tab : input ] we use ckm angles and phases from  @xcite and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 as our input . )",
    "comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig : gauge ] and  [ figure : cutoffreal ] shows that the gut scale is slightly larger in the two - loop case . on the other hand , @xmath46 is significantly larger than in the one - loop case . and ,",
    "we get @xmath57 and accordingly @xmath58gev for the benchmark point p1 , slightly above the one - loop result .    before we summarize our results ,",
    "let us address the issue of the possible origin of higher - dimensional operators we invoke in eq .  .",
    "after all , they play decisive role in making our @xmath0 model realistic .",
    "namely , they affect the yukawa sector in a way that simultaneously allows for realistic charged fermion masses and efficient suppression of the gauge mediated proton decay .",
    "in particular , they modify the gut scale relation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 that basically rules out the gg model . and , they violate another prediction of the gg model , i.e. , @xmath61 , which would prevent one from completely suppressing the gauge boson mediated proton decay  @xcite .",
    "in fact , our considerations of these modifications and proton decay constraints resulted in the upper bound on the cutoff @xmath2",
    ".    as we have shown , the cutoff comes out to be significantly below the planck scale .",
    "this means that we can not resort to the planck scale effects to generate necessary higher - dimensional operators .",
    "it is then natural to ask for the credible renormalizable model that would effectively mimic the original proposal below the cutoff . to this end",
    "we observe that the most minimal renormalizable setup that yields the original model requires introduction of the following two matter pairs : ( @xmath62,@xmath4 ) and ( @xmath5,@xmath63 ) .",
    "these pairs can clearly have gauge invariant mass terms above the gut scale that can be identified with the scale @xmath2 .",
    "once these fields are integrated out the effective model below @xmath2 would have exactly the same features as the original model considered in this paper .",
    "for example , the relevant operators that eventually modify @xmath64 relation are @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "( @xmath5,@xmath63 ) pair is needed to modify @xmath61 .",
    "clearly , such a simple renormalizable realization of the model would also imply asymptotic freedom of the @xmath0 gauge coupling between @xmath2 and the planck scale .",
    "we have investigated the predictions for fermion masses in the minimal realistic non - supersymmetric grand unified model with the sm matter content based on @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "we have shown that it is not possible to achieve @xmath1 unification in this context since the extra contributions to the running of the yukawa couplings are always positive and larger for @xmath59 .",
    "we pointed out that the upper bound on the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory is @xmath67gev which is consistent with the predictions for yukawa couplings and the constraints coming from proton decay .",
