    "<S> this loophole is closed by consideration of the production and decays of massive neutrinos in supernova 1987a . </S>",
    "<S> for example the process @xmath84 operates at a rate @xmath85 relative to the decay @xmath86 and would have generated a @xmath87 ray burst which was not observed by the smm satellite  @xcite . when combined with other arguments relating to energy deposition inside the supernova  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , as well as experimental bounds on fast @xmath88 decays  @xcite , this rules out _ all _ lifetimes shorter than @xmath89  s  @xcite , forbidding the entire solution range for doublet neutrinos .    in order to evade the above bounds </S>",
    "<S> , it may appear adequate to require @xmath0 to be mainly sterile since its direct production , both in supernovae and in the early universe , is then suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> however , sterile neutrinos can also be produced through their mixing with doublet neutrinos , modulated by matter effects . during the collapse phase of a supernova </S>",
    "<S> , resonant @xmath90 conversions may cause rapid deleptonisation of the core which would probably prevent the supernova explosion  @xcite ; however this does not happen for @xmath91 ev@xmath79 so will not apply to the @xmath0 particle . </S>",
    "<S> secondly the energy loss due to emission of sterile neutrinos during the cooling phase would have excessively shortened the @xmath92 burst from sn  1987a for a mixing in the range @xmath93  @xcite ; this argument applies to a neutrino with mass up to @xmath94 mev  @xcite ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and will rule out the allowed region for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> most crucially , the absence of a @xmath87 ray burst from sn 1987a would , as in the case of doublet neutrinos discussed above , rule out radiative decays  @xcite with lifetimes in the range @xmath95  s , taking into account the enhancement of radiative decays for a singlet neutrino ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the production of sterile neutrinos through neutrino oscillations in the early universe  @xcite also presents a problem since @xmath0 particles can be brought into thermal equilibrium at temperatures exceeding a few gev . </S>",
    "<S> although the @xmath0 relic abundance is thus substantially diluted by the entropy release during the subsequent quark - hadron phase transition , @xmath0 decays with a lifetime @xmath96 s will have an adverse effect on primordial nucleosynthesis  @xcite ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the interpretation of the karmen anomaly as a singlet neutrino is severely challenged by astrophysical and cosmological arguments , although there may be a loophole for fast decays with lifetime @xmath97  s which occur in the supernova core and , in the early universe , before nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we proceed to examine the implications of this hypothesis for laboratory experiments which can test it definitively .    identifying @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> as mainly sterile has several distinct repercussions for the @xmath0-decay modes , since gim cancellations no longer suppress fcnc :    \\(i ) the @xmath22 invisible modes are now appreciable ; we obtain @xmath98/|u_{ex}|^2 , \\label{eq : nununu}\\ ] ] assuming that just one singlet neutrino flavour takes part and the other 3 neutrinos are much lighter than @xmath0 ; thus the invisible branching fraction is never less than @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> but our determination of @xmath46 from the karmen @xmath45 plot is preserved , because the latter is determined by the visible decays only : @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> adding invisible decay modes increases the total @xmath0-width and hence the total number of decays in a given detector , but the visible fraction decreases by the same factor and the number of visible decays remains unchanged ( so long as the distance to the detector remains much less than the mean decay length , which is the case here ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) radiative decays @xmath23 , going via loop diagrams , also escape gim suppression for mainly - singlet @xmath0 ; we obtain  @xcite @xmath101 assuming one singlet and summing 3 light final flavours as before . </S>",
    "<S> radiative decays are thus between @xmath102 and @xmath103 of total decays , but can dominate visible decays as follows : @xmath104 @xmath105    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) when @xmath23 modes start to dominate over @xmath106 in the visible decays , we can no longer compensate an increase in @xmath0-production ( increase in @xmath37 ) by a decrease in @xmath46 , so we have to add eq.([eq : eendom ] ) to the solution constraints for a sterile neutrino . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves a reasonable range for sterile dirac but only a small region for sterile majorana solutions in fig.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iv ) a new class of solution is possible , in which @xmath23 dominates the visible decays , in contrast to the solutions displayed in fig.1 where @xmath67 dominates . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions have @xmath107 with @xmath108 determined by eq.([eq : bf ] ) as before , but @xmath46 now contributes negligibly to the decay and we have @xmath109 for dirac @xmath0 ( double this for majorana @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence these solutions are characterized by @xmath110 which automatically satisfies the requirement @xmath111 from eq.([eq : shrock ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are also constrained by the preliminary bound on @xmath112 decays  @xcite from the bebc - wa66 beam dump experiment  @xcite , which here translates into @xmath113 the @xmath0 mean lifetime , dominated by @xmath22 decays , can range between about @xmath114  s ( at the limit where @xmath115 ) to about @xmath116  s ( where @xmath117 approaches its upper limit from eq.([eq : wa66 ] ) ) . thus the @xmath0 mean decay length is always much greater than the distance to the karmen detector , as required . also at the lower end of this lifetime range , the cosmological and astrophysical constraints may perhaps be evaded .    </S>",
    "<S> we now address the further implications of the @xmath0-neutrino scenario for laboratory experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario implies that , with the stopped @xmath8 decay chain as the neutrino source , @xmath0 will be produced not only via @xmath12 ( giving the time - signatured anomaly in the karmen detector ) , but also via @xmath118 and @xmath119 channels . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask how many of these @xmath0 should decay in the karmen detector ( or other detectors ) , compared to the anomaly events , and what their signatures may be .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(a ) the @xmath13 channel . </S>",

    "<S> the detected visible energy spectrum for @xmath67 solutions is shown in fig.2 ; like case </S>",

    "<S> , the decay photon again has energies between 5 and 53 mev with mean value 28 mev .    to summarize , a mainly - sterile neutrino interpretation for @xmath0 is consistent with all laboratory constraints , within limited ranges of mixing parameters , for both dirac and majorana options , although there are some astrophysical and cosmological problems . </S>",
    "<S> solutions with dominant @xmath67 visible decays are constrained by eqs.([eq : shrock])-([eq : sol]),([eq : eendom ] ) ; here the mixing parameters @xmath62 and @xmath140 are adjusted to give compatible values of branching fraction @xmath108 and visible - mode lifetime @xmath141 in fig.1 ( while @xmath117 is negligible ) . </S>",

    "<S> such interpretations imply that other sources of @xmath0-production should contribute appreciable additional @xmath0-decay events in the karmen detector , with different time - structures ; in channels ( a ) and ( b ) the event rate depends on @xmath142 and is appreciable in some dirac @xmath67 solutions and some @xmath23 solutions , but in channel ( c ) the event rate is always @xmath143 of the anomaly event rate . </S>",
    "<S> similar @xmath0-decay signals should also appear in the lsnd detector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since both detectors have approximately the same density , and since both @xmath144-interaction and @xmath0-decay events have the same inverse - square dependence on distance @xmath145 ( so long as @xmath146 ) , the ratio of interactions to decays should be approximately the same in both experiments . </S>",
    "<S> such @xmath0 decays could conceivably provide a background to the @xmath3 oscillation search currently under way  @xcite , although the @xmath147 signal is distinguishable in principle by detecting the delayed 2.2 mev gamma from the subsequent neutron capture @xmath148 . in high - energy neutrino beams , however , where the parent pions have been boosted to energies @xmath149 with @xmath150 , the number of @xmath0-decays in a given detector volume will scale down as @xmath151 $ ] ( where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are @xmath154-restframe momentum and energy ) while the @xmath144 interactions will scale up as @xmath87 ; thus the fraction that are decays decreases as @xmath155 and rapidly becomes negligible . </S>",
