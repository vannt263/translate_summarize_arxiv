    "cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons are probably accelerated by the same engines that accelerate cr protons and nuclei ( galactic supernova explosions ) , whereas positrons are believed to be produced by the interactions of cr with the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "however , electrons and positrons differ significantly from hadrons for what concerns the energy lost during the propagation through the ism : in addition to ionization losses in the ism , due to their small mass they suffer large radiative losses due to electromagnetic processes as synchrotron radiation , inverse compton scattering , and bremsstrahlung . in general , all these effects induce an energy loss rate that increases with the energy as : @xmath3 whereas radiative losses are usually not important for cr protons and nuclei .",
    "therefore , cr electrons can not diffuse for large distances : the radiative losses limit their range to @xcite : @xmath4 in addition , the source must be relatively recent in order not to have important radiative losses : @xmath5 on the contrary , cr protons have a long residence time in the galaxy ( @xmath6 years ) and sample a large fraction ( @xmath7 ) of the disk and halo @xcite .",
    "many authors emphasized that the cr electron spectrum can not be considered representative of a galactic average , but it has to reflect the recent history of the solar system neighborhood ( see for example @xcite ) , expecially in the highest energy range .",
    "however , the existing data on direct cr electron and positron measurements ( figure  [ allx3 ] , table  [ tbl-1 ] ) have been interpreted in a number of different ways . @xcite",
    "considered the overall electron spectrum as the sum of a galactic average and a single source component , and @xcite concluded that vela ( distance 250 pc , age 20 ky ) should have been produced this component .",
    "however , @xcite stressed that the high energy photons coming from vela are likely due to hadronic processes instead of inverse compton scattering .",
    "another possible source could be the monogem pulsar @xcite , whose distance and age match the prediction of the model by @xcite , who attributed the knee feature to a single nearby source . on the other hand , @xcite considered the measured spectrum as the superposition of many `` single - source '' components , producing several spectral breaks and a time dependent electron spectrum . finally , we recall the analysis made by @xcite , who considered different behaviors in different energy ranges , depending on the energy - dependent diffusion coefficient , the energy losses and the distance to the nearest sources .    in this paper we consider only the recent measurements of the cr electron and positron spectra ( starting with mass89 ) and the highest energy data from @xcite .",
    "we corrected the measured spectra for the solar modulation effect in the simplest framework : the spherical symmetric force - field approximation ( section  [ sol - mod ] ) . among these experiments ,",
    "only caprice94 and ams-01 were able to measure both protons and electrons ( and positrons ) . in this case",
    "we use the proton spectrum to measure the solar modulation parameter , whereas neutron monitor rates are used to demodulate the results of the other detectors .",
    "even after this correction , there is still a large spread between measurements of the electron spectrum in the 10100 gev range , where solar effects are very small .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we rescaled all normalization constants in order to reduce this spread , in the hypothesis that systematic errors do not affect sensibly the measured spectral indices .",
    "the resulting spectrum has been fitted with a single power law from 3 gev up to 2 tev , and with a single source model above 10 gev ( section  [ results ] ) . on the other hand , we fitted the positron spectrum with a single power law in kinetic energy ( without any renormalization ) , obtaining the same spectral index as the power law fit of the electrons . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we speculate about the possibility that both electrons and positrons have been accelerated by the same engine .",
    "in addition , we considered the measured e@xmath8/e@xmath9 ratio at low energy as the effect of the solar modulation with a finite propagation time .",
    "in order to estimate the local interstellar spectrum ( lis ) , it is necessary to choose a model for the solar modulation of cosmic rays .",
    "we used the spherically symmetric adiabatic model of @xcite and @xcite , in which the charged particles have a diffusion coefficient that depends on their rigidity @xmath10 and on the distance @xmath11 from the sun , with a typical time scale of 11 years given by the solar activity half - cycle . over this time scale ,",
    "the variation of the incoming cosmic ray flux from the galaxy is negligible , and the problem reduces to the one - dimensional diffusion of charged particles that are adiabatically decelerated by the solar wind .",
    "the analytical solution is possible @xcite , and the measured differential flux @xmath12 of particles with total energy @xmath13 and mass @xmath14 is : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the stationary flux outside the eliosphere of particles with energy @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the energy lost by the particles during their travel .    in this `` force - field '' model",
    ", one can write @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the absolute value of the particle charge and the solar modulation parameter @xmath21 can be expressed as function of the diffusion coefficient and the solar wind velocity .",
    "actually , the full force - field parameter is the adimensional term @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is the rigidity - dependent term of the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite emphasized that above 200 mev @xmath24 and @xmath25 , hence using @xmath26 ( interpreted as the rigidity loss of incoming particles ) as the single parameter is a good approximation to the numerical solution of the spherically - symmetric transport equation that includes adiabatic energy losses correctly . in this paper , we considered @xmath26 a free parameter to be measured independently    a way to quantify the effects of the solar activity on the primary cosmic ray fluxes is to use neutron counters placed in high mountains , that are able to measure the rate of interactions of primary particles with the earth atmosphere by detecting the produced secondary neutrons .",
    "the neutron rate is anti - correlated to the number of sun - spots ( that can be considered an index of solar activity ) while it is correlated to the interplanetary cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "however , the best way to find the value of the solar modulation parameter is to use the proton flux measured at the top of the earth atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this method has been adopted only with the detectors that were able to measure both protons and electrons at the same time : caprice94 ( @xmath27 mv , figure  [ cap94pr ] ) and ams-01 ( @xmath28 mv , figure  [ ams98pr ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath26 found with protons or neutron rates is then used to correct the electron and positron spectra , neglecting charge - dependent modulation effects .",
    "the force - field model is a strong simplification of the propagation process inside the eliosphere ( see for example @xcite ) and must be considered only a first approximation working well only for high enough particle rigidity and for the inner eliosphere @xcite .",
    "however , the very low value of the chi - square compared to the number of degrees of freedom of the ams-01 proton fit with a modulated single power - law is significant .",
    "there is absolutely no indication that the cosmic ray protons spectrum outside the eliosphere is not a single power law in rigidity below 200 gv , an important constraint for propagation models . in any case",
    ", we use the force - field model only as a way to compare different measurements , without stating anything about the underlying physical processes of electron diffusion .",
    "@xcite obtained the primary cosmic ray proton spectrum by fitting the measured ams-01 spectrum above 10 gv with a single power law with unknown spectral index and normalization , assuming that the solar modulation effects can be neglected above this rigidity : their result is @xmath29 ( summing in quadrature the quoted statistical and systematic errors ) .",
    "however we obtain a slightly different spectral index ( @xmath30 ) by fitting with a function of three parameters that takes @xmath26 explicitly into account .",
    "this method is more reliable and demonstrates that when the experimental uncertainties are as low as those of ams-01 the effects of the solar activity can be appreciable up to few tens of gv .",
    "we do not make use of the eldest measurements , apart from data obtained by @xcite , that agree with the recent update by @xcite and are almost insensitive to the solar modulation .",
    "notwithstanding , the existing data sets have a non negligible spread in the 10100 gev range , where the measured fluxes at the same energy may differ even by a factor of 10 . however , supposing that the main source of uncertainty comes from the correction for the residual atmosphere and that this systematic effect is not greatly dependent on the spectral index , one can adjust the normalization constants of the various experiments to reduce the spread @xcite . incidentally , this automatically adjusts the systematic shift due to the positron component for the detectors that were not able to separate positive from negative charges ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) , in the hypothesis that the positron fraction reaches a constant value at high energies .",
    "the resulting local interstellar electron spectrum is shown in figure  [ reclisnormx3 ] , where the inferred local interstellar spectrum of the electrons has been fitted with a single power law from 3 gev to 2 tev .",
    "on the other hand , all positron measurements agree well without renormalization , and are well represented by a single power law in kinetic energy ( figure  [ plisallx3 ] ) , the only exception being the low energy data points obtained by heat95 , whose electron measurement at low energy is also in disagreement with other experiments .",
    "as shown in figures [ reclisnormx3 ] and [ plisallx3 ] , the lis inferred from the heat95 measurement @xcite differ significantly from the other experiments below few gev , both for electrons and positrons .",
    "the electron measurement done by mass89 @xcite is the only one that agrees with heat95 at low energy , even though the latter took data during a solar minimum whereas the former operated during a solar maximum .",
    "hence it seems unlikely that the discrepancy between these two experiments and the other ones is caused by a bad demodulation procedure .",
    "rather , it seems that unknown systematics affect these results .",
    "both the electron and the positron spectra can be fitted with single power - laws , and the two spectral indices obtained by the best fit procedures are compatible : the local interstellar spectra have @xmath0 for electrons above 3 gev and @xmath31 for positrons up to 60 gev .",
    "the single power - law fit of the electron lis has a not very good chi - square compared to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "however , with exception of caprice94 and ams-01 , that quoted both statistical and systematic errors ( here summed in quadrature ) , it must be noted that all experiments quoted only statistical errors in the numerical tables .",
    "the systematics are usually of the order of 10% at least , and were not considered in the fit .",
    "hence the obtained chi - square should not be considered that bad . on the other hand",
    ", the chi - square of the positron lis fit with a single power - law is quite good , taking into consideration statistical errors only ( apart from caprice94 and ams-01 ) .",
    "the highest energy data points @xcite come all from the same kind of detector , using the emulsion chambre technique .",
    "several authors have seen a cut - off at about 700800 gev in the first measurement by @xcite .",
    "however , the last published data by @xcite extend the energy range up to 2 tev , making it very difficult to affirm that a cut - off does indeed exist below 1 tev . in order to test the cut - off hypothesis",
    ", we obtained the best fit of the electron lis using the single source model by @xcite ( figure  [ atoyanx3 ] ) .",
    "this quite complex function depends on the source distance @xmath11 and age @xmath32 , on the injection spectrum spectral index @xmath33 , and on the exponent @xmath34 of the diffusion coefficient @xmath35 , and should well represent data at high energy , where the single source is expected to dominate over the galactic component ( important at lower energies ) . in our knowledge",
    ", this paper is the first one where this function is used in a best fit procedure : other authors simply computed it for nearby source candidates and compared the result with the measurement .",
    "we used the single source spectrum to fit the electron lis above 10 gev , obtaining a very good chi - square value .",
    "the results is that the single source must be recent [ @xmath36 y ] and very near to the solar system ( @xmath37 pc ) .",
    "in addition , the source spectral index is 2.4 and the exponent of the diffusion coefficient appears to be @xmath38 , greater than the usual adopted value of 0.6 but consistent with recent simulations by @xcite .",
    "however , in case of a single source dominating the lis at high energy over the galactic component , we should see a spectral change at 1020 gev , that is not seen by caprice94 ( figure  [ caprice94lis ] ) and ams-01 ( figure  [ ams98elpo ] ) .      using the same value for @xmath26 as given by the protons fit and neglecting any variation in the rigidity dependence of the electron diffusion coefficient , it is possible to correct for the solar effects the electron and positron primary spectra measured by caprice94 @xcite and ams-01 @xcite using equation ( [ eq - sol - mod ] ) , as shown in figures [ caprice94lis ] and [ ams98elpo ] .",
    "we would expect this approximation to break down at low energies , due to the change of the diffusion coefficient of e@xmath8 and e@xmath9 below few gv @xcite .",
    "however , the damping at low energies in the local interstellar spectrum of electrons is not visible in the positron lis , similar to the proton lis shown in figures [ cap94pr ] and [ ams98pr ] .",
    "instead , the force - field approximation is working very well both for protons and positrons over the whole energy range , and for electrons above few gev .",
    "the next order approximation should take into account the particle charge @xcite .",
    "this effect is expected to be more evident at lower energies and could explain the feature visible in the electron lis but not in the positrons lis .",
    "in addition , the electron lis inferred from caprice94 data is a power - law above 3 gev , whereas the ams-01 spectrum is damped below 2 gev . in 1994",
    "the cr flux was recovering from the minimum occurred in 1991 , while in 1998 the situation was opposite : the flux was decreasing from the maximum in 1997 towards the following minimum ( in 2000 ) .",
    "because the solar modulation has a necessary delay connected with the propagation time of the magnetic irregularities from the sun to the eliopause , it is evident that the damping should be higher just following a cr minimum than for periods preceding a minimum .",
    "this can explain why ams-01 data show a departure from the single power law at lower energies than caprice94 .",
    "however , this effect is not observed in the proton and positron spectra , hence it has to be connected with the particle charge sign .    during the nineties ,",
    "the sun was in a positive half - cycle , when the magnetic field emerging from the north pole of the sun pointed outward @xcite . in this case , the antisymmetry of the parker field above and below the equatorial plane produces drift velocity fields for positive particles that converge on the equator , whereas negative particles diverge from it @xcite .",
    "during the negative polarity solar half - cycle started in 2001 the situation is reversed , and the damping at low energy should be visible with positrons but not in the electron spectra . measurements from future experiments will allow to check this behavior .",
    "the positive half solar cycle positron to electron ratio @xmath39 is shown in figure  [ qrlisnormrec ] , where we computed it starting from the absolute fluxes ( we did not include the results of experiments that did not published absolute fluxes ) .",
    "the ratio exponentially decreases from about 1:3 to 1:10 with increasing local interstellar energy from 0.7 gev to about 4 gev ( the most interesting region for the study of the diffusion coefficient ) , then it seems to be flat .",
    "the possible `` bump '' seen by @xcite has not been confirmed by any other experiment : the ratio flattens at high energies .",
    "the cosmic ray electron flux is being measured since 30 years with balloon and satellite experiments over a wide energy range .",
    "the results from different detectors are not always compatible within quoted errors , expecially for the eldest experiments .",
    "in addition the energy range below 100 gev is covered by many experiments , but above this level only data from @xcite and @xcite are available up to now .",
    "they were obtained using the emulsion chambre technique , but in the near future different methods will be adopted .",
    "for example the pamela @xcite and ams-02 @xcite detectors will be magnetic spectrometers with proton - electron discrimination obtained using an electromagnetic calorimeter and a transition radiation detector .",
    "after renormalizing the different measurements at 20 gev , the single power - law fit of the lis of cr electrons gives a spectral index of @xmath0 , from 3 gev up to 2 tev . on the other hand ,",
    "the positron lis can be fitted by a single power - law over the whole energy range covered by existing measurements , without any renormalization .",
    "the positron spectral index @xmath1 is remarkably equal to the electron value within the small errors .",
    "no evident cut - off can be found below 12 tev in the electron spectrum , indicating that their source must be recent ( at most few @xmath40 years ) and nearby ( few 100 parsecs ) .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that both electrons and positrons were accelerated by the same source , according to the following scenario .",
    "electrons are produced by supernova explosions and by the interactions of cr hadrons ( mostly protons and he nuclei ) with the ism , whereas positrons are mostly secondary products of these interactions .",
    "the spectral index of protons is about 2.8 , and this is also the injection spectral index of positrons . in stationary conditions , the positrons loose energy by radiative processes and their spectral index is lowered by one , becoming roughly equal to 3.8 .",
    "this average galactic population was present also in the solar system neighborhood , where they were reaccelerated by the recent shock wave that accelerated electrons , likely produced by the last supernova among those that formed the local bubble @xcite .",
    "the `` natural '' spectral index produced by this engine has to be @xmath41 , equal to or slightly harder than the measured spectral index of positrons and electrons , because the acceleration is recent enough for the spectrum not to have been distorted significantly by radiative losses .",
    "the injection spectral index is also harder than the pre - existing positron spectral index , thus it is possible that positrons gained energy during the reacceleration @xcite .",
    "the shock wave compression ratio was @xmath42 , i.e.  it was `` softer '' than the usual compression ratio @xmath43 used in the literature @xcite , that corresponds to a source spectral index @xmath44 and to a synchrotron spectral index @xmath45 .",
    "this value for @xmath46 is the average value of the green s catalog of galactic supernova remnants @xcite , whereas the value inferred from the measured positron and electron spectra ( @xmath47 ) is higher than all measurements reported in this catalog .",
    "hence , we do not expect to see important effects on the synchrotron background due to the shock wave that accelerated electrons and positrons .",
    "in addition , the proton spectrum should not be affected at all , for two reasons : first , protons have a long residence time in the galaxy and sample about one third of its disk",
    ". hence one can estimate the number @xmath48 of supernovae that contributed to the proton spectrum considering the rate of supernova explosions in one third of the galactic disk as @xmath49 and the residence time as @xmath50  y , then @xmath51 .",
    "thus a single source will tipically contribute a very small fraction of the cr protons .",
    "second , the `` natural '' spectral index produced by our source is higher than the proton index , i.e.  its spectrum is softer . in this case",
    ", one does not expect such a weak reacceleration to increase the existing spectral index : it remains the same as before the shock @xcite .",
    "a source with no sensible effects on the hadronic component of galactic cosmic rays is also compatible with the absence of a persistent negative trend in the cr intensity , confirmed by the analysis of @xcite , who considered the cr flux over the last 400 years .    at low energy , the extrapolated local interstellar spectrum of cr electrons",
    "is flattened , whereas the positron spectrum given by caprice94 and ams-01 is still well represented by a single power law down to the lowest inferred lis energy ( 0.7 gev ) .",
    "in addition , the damping appeared at 3 gev in 1994 , following a solar maximum , and at 2 gev in 1998 , just before the solar minimum .",
    "a charge- and time - dependent solar modulation effect @xcite with finite propagation velocity could explain this difference , though new measurements with high accuracy in the negative polarity solar half - cycle ( where the behavior of electrons and positrons should be exchanged ) are needed to confirm it , and several measurements in different times or long duration missions are needed to quantify this first order effect .",
    "future experiments pamela and ams-02 will be able to measure the absolute fluxes of positrons and electrons up to few hundreds gev during several years , and will be decisive to understand this phenomenon .    the authors wish to thank the ams collaboraion for having provided the numerical tables of the e@xmath8 and e@xmath9 spectra , and s. cecchini , v.a .",
