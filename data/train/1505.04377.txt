    "magnetization structures in the form of topological solitons have come to the center of research interest following the fabrication of various ferromagnetic materials .",

    "they are deflected in a direction almost perpendicular to an applied magnetic field gradient @xcite and their dynamics is seen to be similar to the hall motion of a charged particle in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "a theoretical description links the dynamics of topological solitons with their nonzero topological number , by example of magnetic bubbles @xcite .",
    "the opportunity now arises to study peculiar soliton dynamics for the case of skyrmions in dm materials .",
    "these materials are well suited for such studies for two main reasons .",
    "the dm interaction introduces an intrinsic length scale which defines the size of the skyrmion , therefore the skyrmion is expected to be robust and remain rigid under external probes . in the presence of easy - axis anisotropy we have a topological skyrmion with skyrmion number @xmath0 as well as non - topological @xmath1 solitons ( @xmath4 vortices ) @xcite thus allowing to explore theoretical predictions for dramatically different dynamical behaviors .",
    "skyrmions could be the stable and robust entities that are needed for the technology of recording and transferring information , currently mainly obtained in magnetic media using domain walls .",
    "current induced motion is under intensive study and it is a promising technique for the manipulation of magnetic information @xcite . the different dynamical behaviors which will be described in this paper can help skyrmions emerge as particularly attractive entities for applications in the area of transfer of magnetic information .",
