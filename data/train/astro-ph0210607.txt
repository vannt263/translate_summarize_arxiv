    "faint blue stars at high galactic latitude were first detected in a survey conducted by @xcite .",
    "soon after , @xcite brought attention to a number of high velocity stars of early spectral type .",
    "the faint apparent magnitudes ( sizable distances ) and high velocities led to the conclusion that these objects , which appear at low spectroscopic dispersions to be population i stars , were a part of the galactic halo .",
    "a debate has raged since about the origin and characteristics of these high galactic latitude b - stars .",
    "uncertainty about the masses or true distances of these stars has left the door open to many different scenarios .",
    "the discovery that is an eclipsing binary @xcite raises to three the number of known eclipsing binaries at least 1 kpc above the galactic plane whose components are b - type stars .",
    "the other two are v tuc @xcite and do peg @xcite .",
    "it lib is the brightest of the three and has light curve and radial velocity data gathered for it . as a result , it lib presents us with an excellent opportunity to directly measure the masses of a pair of high galactic latitude b - stars .",
    "photometric variability was first noted in by @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted variability on the order of 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "@xcite classified the spectra of as b2/b3 ( iv)(n ) with a note that the lines appeared `` somewhat filled in . ''",
    "later observations by the hipparcos satellite confirmed photometric variability .",
    "the @xmath0 naming list of the ibvs @xcite assigned the designation and classified it as a possible eclipsing binary .",
    "analysis of the hipparcos photometry annex data yielded an ephemeris with the parameters : @xmath1 days , @xmath2 jd @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there was a beat pattern between the period of it lib and the duty cycle of the hipparcos satellite so substantial gaps were left in the phase coverage from phase 0.30 to 0.58 and phase 0.63 to 0.75 .",
    "the hipparcos data show a strong primary eclipse but the secondary eclipse falls in the gap of observations .",
    "high resolution spectra were taken of it lib with the sandiford echelle spectrograph @xcite on the mcdonald observatory 82 \" struve reflector in march 1999 , february 2001 , and may 2002 .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "the spectra were reduced and extracted using iraf and analyzed using the asp software package of @xcite .",
    "lines , lines , and the 4481 line all have profiles with two well defined minima over most of the observed period ( see figure 1 for an example ) .",
    "the broadening due to rotation of the individual components is on the order of 100 - 150 km / s so that the lines from each component never completely separate from each other .",
    "this blending probably accounts for the line peculiarities noted by @xcite .",
    "as modeled in section 4 of this paper , the primary component is three to four times as bright as the secondary in the band - pass of these spectroscopic observations so that its spectral lines dominate the composite spectra .",
    "an assortment of , , , , and lines could be identified at the radial velocity of the primary component but no lines other than , , or 4481 could be positively identified and attributed to the secondary .",
    "the minima of the he i line profiles were used to measure the radial velocity of each component . at some phases , the center of the contribution from the secondary",
    "could not be measured due to blending so that only the radial velocity of the primary was measured at those phases .",
    "table 2 summarizes the radial velocity measurements made from the observations and figure 2 shows them plotted by phase using the @xcite parameters .    for the analysis in section 4 the individual weights of each radial velocity measure",
    "are set equal to each other .",
    "the measurements of the radial velocity of the secondary are somewhat more uncertain than those of the primary s velocity because the lines of the secondary are significantly weaker and often partially blended with the lines of the primary .",
    "the relative weighting of the two velocity curves is accounted for in the curve dependent weights assigned to each data set as discussed in section 4 .",
    "the photometric data for it lib from the hipparcos catalog epoch photometry annex has substantial gaps in phase space .",
    "an effort was made to obtain more photometric observations of it lib at the unobserved phases in order to verify that the system does have a secondary eclipse and to provide more points for light curve fitting in order to determine the properties of the system .",
    "two sets of additional data were obtained .",
    "@xcite obtained observations with the 2048x2048 tektronix ccd ( t2ka ) with a johnson b filter on the kitt peak 2.1-m .",
    "those observations were reduced using sky flats and the non - linearity correction of @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the ccd observations were obtained using the 1024x1024 flicam ( sia-003 ab site back - illuminated ccd ) using cousins r and i filters on the warner & swasey observatory , nassau station 36 \" reflector .",
    "table 3 gives a summary of the observations .",
    "the data were reduced in iraf and aperture photometry was done with the iraf procedure qphot .",
    "the apertures for qphot were set to approximately 3 sigma the fwhm of the stellar profiles .",
    "table 4 identifies the reference stars .",
    "all the reference stars are between three and five magnitudes fainter than the target",
    ". there are no brighter reference stars in the fields of view ( @xmath3 for the 2.1-m data and @xmath4 for the 36  data ) . as a result , uncertainty in the background turned out to be the largest contributing factor to the photometry errors .",
    "the simple average of the scaled relative magnitudes with respect to each reference star is taken to be the measured relative magnitude of it lib for each individual image .",
    "the sigma is taken as the random error of each individual measurement .",
    "the errors are higher for the measurements in cousins r because the night sky is significantly brighter in that band - pass .",
    "larger errors also occurred on nights where moon light and/or clouds and humidity made significant contributions to the sky brightness . only data with errors smaller than 50 milli - magnitudes was used in the analysis ( figure 3 ) .",
    "there was no need for absolute calibration of the photometry gathered .",
    "the @xcite code used to perform the analysis is capable of performing a simultaneous solution to multiple light curves in multiple filters / band - passes .",
    "the relative magnitudes in each filter were converted to relative intensity normalized to phase 0.25 and inputted as four separated data sets ( johnson b , cousins r , cousins i , and hipparcos v ) along with the appropriate effective wavelength data for each filter .",
    "individual data points were weighted by the inverse square of their error .",
    "the parameters of the it lib system were derived from the radial velocity and photometric data using the program of @xcite .",
    "@xcite uses the model of @xcite with some modifications .",
    "the following assumptions are used : synchronous rotation of the components , the components radiate as black bodies , an orbital period of 2.267460 days and a zero epoch of 2448500.76777 @xcite , and the luminosity of the secondary component is computed as a function of temperature and surface area of that component .",
    "the logarithmic limb darkening law was used .",
    "limb darkening coefficients used in the models are taken from the tables of @xcite for stars of the appropriate mass and temperature .",
    "the gravity brightening and reflective albedo coefficients used are the ones suggested by @xcite for hot stars with radiative envelopes . while the temperature of the secondary component is allowed to float , the temperature of the primary component is held constant at 22000 k , which is consistent with the observed colors of the system and the mass of the primary component .",
    "curve dependent weights were applied in order to compensate for the differences in precision between the light and velocity data sets .",
    "the @xcite code allows the weighting of curves by the standard deviation of the curve ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the method of @xcite using the differences between pairs of consecutive points in phase space was used for calculating the value of @xmath5 for each light curve . in the case of the radial velocity curves ,",
    "the values were not spaced close enough to evaluate differences between consecutive points in phase space so the truncated fft method @xcite was used instead by simulating the velocity curve to first order with a sine function . the curve dependent weights calculated from this method are listed in table 5 .",
    "the @xmath5 for each velocity curve , when normalized to the curve amplitude , is roughly 20 times larger than the @xmath5 of each of the light curves , which translates to a relative weight in the total solution on the order of 400 times smaller than the light curve weights .",
    "some parameters have no dependence on the light curves ( such as the semi - major axis and @xmath6 velocity ) .",
    "full simultaneous solutions of both light and velocity data together calculated errors for these parameters on order of 50 to 60 percent of the parameter values . solutions performed using only the the velocity data produced parameters with almost the same values but with errors that were two to four times smaller than those obtained in the full simultaneous solution .",
    "this led to the conclusion that the weights of the velocity curves were probably understated relative to the light curves .",
    "it seems reasonable that the velocity data sets should have lower curve weights since they have significantly fewer data points .",
    "however , the velocity data is more evenly distributed in phase space than any of the light curves .    in order to rectify the difference between the errors in the full solution and the solution using only the velocity data , the calculated @xmath5 values for the velocity curves were divided by a factor of ten .",
    "this change gave the velocity curves roughly the same but still less weight than each of the light curves .",
    "when these curve weights were applied to the full simultaneous solution none of the derived parameter values were significantly different from those obtained using the unaltered curve weights .",
    "however , using the altered curve weights did reduce the errors of the velocity dependent parameters to essentially the same error values given by the solution to the velocity data alone .",
    "these corrected @xmath5 values were used in the analysis to obtain the best fit parameters .",
    "the @xcite code uses a least squares fit that is iterated to simultaneously solve the parameters of the system .",
    "the program was run in a mode reserved for detached binary systems .",
    "table 6 lists the best fits to the parameters defining the it lib system .",
    "figure 2 shows the fit to the radial velocity data and figure 3 shows the fit to the light curve .",
    "the eclipses in the system are partial and the system is best modeled by stars of @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath8 separated by @xmath10 solar radii .",
    "the calculated masses of the components are consistent with main sequence stars of spectral class b2 and b7 .",
    "the primary component is about three to four times as bright as the secondary , so its spectra dominates the observed composite spectra .",
    "the photometric distance to the system can be found knowing the relative brightness of the components and the absolute magnitude of the primary component .",
    "it is possible to find the distance from the absolute magnitude of the combined system but this introduces additional uncertainties in the form of assumptions that would have to be made about the absolute properties of both the primary and secondary component .",
    "since the light from the system is dominated by the primary , its absolute properties are better constrained .",
    "the relative brightness of the components is also well defined by the fit to the light curves .",
    "the absolute bolometric magnitude of the primary as calculated by the @xcite code is -5.20 .",
    "the bolometric correction for a b2 v star is -2.35 @xcite which yields an absolute v magnitude of -2.85 for the a component .",
    "the apparent v magnitude of the primary ( @xmath11 ) can be obtained from the apparent magnitude of the combined system ( @xmath12 ) and the fraction of light from the primary relative to the combined system ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath14    the calculation is carried out at maximum light in johnson v ( phase 0.271 ) .",
    "the observed maximum apparent v magnitude of the combined system taken from @xcite is 9.09 .",
    "the apparent magnitude comes from the maximum apparent magnitude of the system in the tycho v filter , corrected to johnson v by the method prescribed by @xcite .",
    "the fraction of light from the primary relative to the combined system ( f ) is 0.7767 as calculated by the @xcite code .",
    "this yields a apparent v magnitude of 9.71 for the primary alone .",
    "the extinction factor ( @xmath15 ) from @xcite is 0.702 ( assuming @xmath15/e(b - v)=3.1 ) . from the above",
    "quantities a distance of 2.4 kpc is obtained which places it lib 1.0 kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "there are many sources of error to consider including the uncertainty in the physical parameters of the primary component , uncertainty in the extinction factor , and uncertainty in the relative brightness of the components .",
    "an error of a few tenths of a magnitude would translate into a twenty to thirty percent error in distance .",
    "the true errors in this case are unknown so a standard photometric distance error of @xmath16 is assumed in the following analysis .",
    "knowing the distance , the systemic radial velocity , and the proper motions allow one to compute the true space velocity of the system .",
    "proper motions for this system are present in hipparcos @xcite , the act2000 @xcite , the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , and the ucac1 @xcite .",
    "these independent measures were averaged together by the method of @xcite to obtain a more accurate average proper motion of @xmath17 mas / yr and @xmath18 mas / yr . the systemic radial velocity ( @xmath19 km / s ) was taken from the analysis of the radial velocity curves .",
    "the uvw space velocities were computed by the method of @xcite .",
    "the uvw velocities were converted to @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 assuming the solar motion of ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) = ( -9 km / s , 232 km / s , 7 km / s ) for an object in close proximity to the sun with ( u , v , w)=(0,0,0 ) @xcite .",
    "it libs true space velocity was computed to be ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) = ( @xmath23 km / s , @xmath24 km / s , @xmath25 km / s ) .",
    "errors are difficult to estimate for these velocities because the true error in the distance in unknown . for this analysis the distance error",
    "is assumed to be @xmath16 ( @xmath26 kpc ) , which is reasonable for a photometric distance .",
    "@xmath20 are @xmath21 are consistent with a star within the rotating galactic disk . @xmath22 and the height above the plane lead to the conclusion that while components of it libs velocity are disk - like that it has been some how ejected out of the disk into the galactic halo .",
    "of particular interest is that it lib is moving back toward the plane of the galaxy , presumably traveling on the down - hill side of a ballistic trajectory .",
    "the average main - sequence lifetime of a ten solar mass star is about 22 million years @xcite .",
    "the orbital integrator of @xcite was used to estimate the number of years that have elapsed since it lib was last in the galactic plane ( z=0 ) . by integrating the orbit backwards in time",
    "it is found that it took @xmath27 million years for it lib to travel from z = 0 to its present location .",
    "the maximum z distance that it lib reaches from the disk on this trajectory is just over 1.1 kpc .",
    "we shall return to this apparent discrepancy after a discussion of the abundance analysis of the primary component .",
    "the spectrum used for the abundance analysis of it lib was taken at phase 0.829 ( march 31 , 1999 , see table 1 ) . according to the model of the system , at this phase both stars",
    "are un - obscured so that the observed spectra is a straight blend of the light from both components . at this phase",
    "the lines of the primary and secondary component are near maximum separation , making it easier to measure the contribution to the line from each individual component .",
    "equivalent widths of twelve lines identified with the primary component were measured . because both stars are un - obscured at this phase the continuum contribution from the secondary",
    "could easily be removed from the measured equivalent widths .",
    "the continuum contribution of the secondary component was removed from the measured equivalent widths by calculating the ratio between the continuum flux of the primary versus the total combined flux of the system ( f ) and applying this ratio to the equivalent width in this manner : + @xmath28 the value of f is calculated for the appropriate band - pass and phase using the @xcite code ( f=0.816 at phase 0.829 ) .",
    "w is equivalent width measured from the composite spectra .",
    "and w is the re - scaled equivalent width used in the abundance analysis .",
    "there were no lines ( other than the , , and 4481 lines ) that could be positively identified and attributed to the secondary .",
    "this is not surprising due to a combination of the signal to noise of the observation , the rotational broadening of the components , and the fact that the light from the primary component dominates the spectra .",
    "the lines that were measured for the primary component are listed in table 7 along with the atomic data for those lines .",
    "the computer program lines @xcite was used to calculate lte abundances from the equivalent widths for individual lines .",
    "the primary broadening mechanism in these stars is the quadratic stark effect , for which this version of lines uses the method of @xcite .",
    "atlas9 @xcite was used to build the stellar atmospheric models .    because the primary is slightly distorted the gravity varies by a small amount over the surface . the mean surface gravity for the primary component as calculated by the wilson ( 2001 )",
    "code is log(g ) = 3.75 .",
    "the effective temperature of a @xmath29 star is approximately 22000 k. the temperature / gravity relations of @xcite obtain the following values for the strmgren photometry published by @xcite : t = 22060 k , log(g ) = 3.62 .",
    "this agrees well with the parameters obtained from the model of the system .",
    "the microturbulence was determined using the lines of the @xmath30 triplet .",
    "the relative gf values of the triplet are well known and the lines cover a range of equivalent widths making this triplet ideal for determining microturbulence .",
    "the microturbulence is calculated from the triplet by finding the value at which each line in the triplet gives the same abundance value so that there is no trend in abundance with respect to equivalent width .",
    "the microturbulence found for each model used is listed in table 8 .",
    "these are rather typical values for a b - star of this temperature under the assumption of lte .",
    "the results of the analysis over a range of temperatures and gravities are presented in table 8 .",
    "the favored model is 22000 k , log(g ) = 3.75 .",
    "the results for individual lines in the favored model are listed in table 7 .",
    "the results using other models over a range of temperatures and gravities are presented to demonstrate how differences in the atmospheric models effect the abundances . for comparison",
    "the solar abundance values @xcite and the average abundance values for a sample of population i b - stars @xcite are given . the sample of population i b",
    "- stars are twelve stars situated in the galactic plane covering the range of atmospheric parameters representative of b - stars .",
    "the abundances in these stars were analyzed in the same manner as it lib .",
    "the abundances of the primary component are consistent with those for a normal population i b - star over the entire range of temperatures and gravities explored . and are a bit depressed ; however , when the errors in the analysis are considered these anomalies are negligible .",
    "the discrepancy between the main - sequence lifetime of the primary component ( 22 myr ) and the travel time back to the disk ( 33 myr ) may present a conundrum .",
    "three possibilities exist to resolve the apparent conflict of facts : the travel time and main - sequence lifetime are not in conflict when all possible systematic errors are considered , the a component of the it lib system is somehow enjoying a prolonged main - sequence lifetime due to mass transfer or other method of rejuvenation , or the it lib system did not form in the galactic disk .",
    "the error budget for calculating the orbit of it lib does not allow for the possibility that it lib was in the galactic plane 22 million years ago or less .",
    "each component of the true space velocity is the sum of a term including the radial velocity and a term with a linear dependence on the distance to the star .",
    "the radial velocity term is well determined compared to the second term which is perturbed by the error in the proper motion and multiplied by the uncertainty in the distance .",
    "recall that the error in the distance is unknown , so in the monte - carlo error simulation a distance error of @xmath16 was assumed .",
    "a change in the distance would effect the u , v , and w velocities in a linear manner by -4.9 km / s / kpc , 1.6 km / s / kpc , and -9.2 km / s / kpc . if it lib is further away then it takes even longer for it to journey from the galactic plane to its present location so we are only concerned with the possibility that the distance has been overestimated .",
    "because of the way that the velocity vector of it lib is oriented with respect to the plane of the sky , a large change in distance does not have a significant effect on the velocity vector of the star .",
    "if the distance to it lib is taken to be only 1 kpc then it still takes about 28 million years to return to the galactic plane .",
    "the likelihood is that there is not enough room in the error budget of the true velocity to put it lib in the plane any sooner than 28 million years ago .",
    "the galactic potential model and integrator used to calculate the trajectory of it lib are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "this model contains disk , halo , bulge , and dark halo components which are able to reproduce the observed motions of stars both in the disk and the halo under the most rigorous testing .",
    "the model assumes a smooth distribution of matter in the galactic disk which is a good approximation for our purposes since the gravitational influence of inhomogeneities in the disk only becomes significant within a few hundred parsecs of the galactic plane .",
    "stars on orbits that take them kiloparsecs out of the plane spend very little of their time that close so for all intents and purposes the potential they experience is not significantly perturbed from the smooth approximation .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this is a robust model that does not significantly contribute to the errors associated with the travel time back to the disk .",
    "there is probably more uncertainty in the main - sequence lifetime of the primary component than in the travel time back to the disk .",
    "the main - sequence lifetime of a star is a simple relation between the luminosity of the star and the amount of hydrogen available to undergo fusion in the core . mixing ( by rotation , convection , or other means )",
    "can lengthen the main sequence lifetime of a star by increasing the amount of hydrogen available for burning in the core . modeling",
    "the evolution of massive stars becomes a complicated problem requiring the accounting of many processes , some of which are only known to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated for a model of a 9 @xmath8 star the time to hydrogen depletion in the core can vary as much as 4 million years just by including or excluding convective overshooting from the model .",
    "stellar rotation also influences mixing .",
    "@xcite calculated that a 10 @xmath8 star rotating at 200 km / s has a main sequence lifetime of 25 million years versus only 19 million years for the same model without rotation . in the it lib system",
    "there is the additional consideration of the mixing effects that may be induced in one component through tidal interaction with the other component .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the effect of all these factors on the main - sequence lifetime of it lib a but it seems reasonable to assume that the main - sequence lifetime falls in the range from 22 to 32 million years .    taking all factors into account it would be reasonable to say that it lib was formed in the galactic disk just over 30 million years ago and that the primary component is still on the hydrogen burning main sequence .",
    "when the uncertainty in the main sequence lifetime of a 10 @xmath31 star in a close binary system is combined with uncertainty in the travel time back to the disk this becomes a plausible explanation for it lib .",
    "@xcite cite two mechanisms that are thought to produce a majority of run - away o and b - type stars : the binary - supernova scenario ( bss ) and the dynamical ejection scenario ( des ) .",
    "stars ejected by the des mechanism should not show any discrepancy between their actual and apparent ages .",
    "the problem remains of how one might eject a binary star system from the disk .",
    "while ejection scenarios may favor single stars it still is possible , however unlikely it may be , that close binaries could also be ejected .",
    "it lib is a unique system and may well be one of those rare binaries that undergo des ejection .",
    "stars ejected from the disk by bss once had a close companion , which exploded in a supernova .",
    "when the shell from the explosion passes the secondary , the system becomes unbound and the companion flies off with a velocity comparable to its original orbital velocity . because mass transfer would occur in such a system prior to and as a result of the supernova explosion the ejected companion is `` rejuvenated . ''",
    "@xcite show by tracing bss candidates back to their star cluster of origin that run - aways produced by bss are probably blue - stragglers , appearing younger than they really are .",
    "if it lib were ejected by bss then it would have probably originated in a ternary system with the current components orbiting the more massive supernova progenitor at a distance greater than the distance between the remaining components .",
    "the mass transfer from the supernova progenitor to the remaining components could possibly explain the discrepancy between their main - sequence lifetimes and travel time back to the disk .",
    "there is probably not any appreciable mass transfer occurring in the system now because the model shows it is fully detached and there are no spectral emission features ( particularly @xmath32 ) that could be associated with a mass stream or accretion disk .",
    "it is probable that a mass transfer event large enough to influence the evolution of either component in the system would manifest itself as photospheric abundance anomalies . in order to move enough mass to have a significant impact one would have to dredge deep enough to involve processed material in the mass transfer that would end up in the outer layers of the component receiving the transfer .",
    "another possibility is that the it lib system did not form in the galactic disk at all .",
    "the apex of the trajectory followed by it lib occurred 10 million years ago at a height of 1.1 kpc .",
    "assuming that it lib formed in a high velocity cloud ( hvc ) or intermediate velocity cloud ( ivc ) at that time there would be no conflict between the main - sequence lifetime of the primary and the travel time from its position at birth to its current location .",
    "the motions of molecular clouds are influenced by magnetic and hydrodynamic forces that do not affect the motions of individual stars @xcite . as a result it seems possible to form a close binary pair and drop it out of a cloud on a trajectory toward the disk without invoking any binary star ejection mechanism .",
    "@xcite and @xcite report that the conditions thought to exist in hvcs are conducive to the formation of individual massive stars .",
    "even though the conditions appear to exist in the hvcs for star formation to theoretically occur , no observational evidence of star formation in these clouds has been found @xcite .",
    "star formation apparently is occurring under what are thought to be similar environmental conditions in the hi bridge between the lmc and smc @xcite .",
    "@xcite report signs of star formation occurring in the halo of edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 253 , which they conclude shows it is possible for star formation to currently be occurring in the hvcs of the milky way . while the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence , it would be easier to accept the scenario of it lib forming in an hvc or ivc if there was other , more compelling , evidence . due to uncertainties in the distances and trajectories of the ivcs and hvcs",
    "it is not possible to determine if any known hvc or ivc clouds intersect the orbit of it lib at any time in the past",
    ".      the results of the abundance analysis could provide additional information that would favor one scenario over another .",
    "if it lib were rejuvenated and ejected in a bss ejection then it is expected that the elemental abundances observed in the photospheres of the components should be enhanced , particularly those abundances of helium and nitrogen @xcite . likewise ,",
    "if it lib had undergone mass transfer between components in its past then the abundances might reflect this activity .",
    "if it lib were formed in an hvc or ivc we would expect the abundances of the components to be compatible with those observed by @xcite for those clouds .",
    "the analysis of the lines associated with the primary component of it lib show abundances that are in line with those expected for a population i b - star found in the galactic disk .",
    "nitrogen does not appear to be significantly enhanced as would be expected in the bss scenario .",
    "there are no other obvious abundance anomalies as would be expected if processed material had been accreted onto the primary .",
    "even if the atmospheric parameters of the primary are varied over a range of gravities and temperatures , the derived photospheric abundances are consistent with what would be expected for a `` normal '' population i b - star found in the galactic disk .",
    "the abundances of the primary do not lend weight to any of the scenarios involving rejuvenation of the system through mass transfer nor does it lib a appear to be markedly metal poor as might be expected from a star formed in an hvc or ivc in the galactic halo .",
    "there does seem to be enough evidence to suggest that there is actually no discrepancy between the main - sequence lifetime of the primary and the travel time back to the disk .",
    "when accounting for possible errors , particularly those associated with the main - sequence lifetime of a massive star , it becomes evident that there is probably no discrepancy at all .",
    "it seems most likely that it lib is a pair of population i b - stars that were ejected from the star forming regions of the galactic disk by des about 30 million years ago .",
    "it is important to recognize that conclusions reached about the it lib system do not automatically apply to any other high galactic latitude b - stars .",
    "the careful analysis of full space velocities ( radial velocities and proper motions ) using a comprehensive model of the galactic potential will help identify more population i b - stars that have been ejected from the disk .",
    "the reasons to study a sample of normal population i b - stars at large distances may not be obvious , when their nearby cousins are easier to study at high precision .",
    "population i b - stars that have been ejected from the disk have a lower limit set on their ages by the analysis of their trajectory , constraining their ages better than their disk - bound counter parts . as a result",
    "these stars might be used to start to piece together an observational picture of the evolution of high mass b - stars on the main - sequence .",
    "this would be of great benefit to those that model these stars and may help enhance our understanding of stellar energy generation and energy transport processes in general .",
