    "oppositely - charged dimuon production in neutrino - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) provide an excellent source of information on the structure of the nucleon , the dynamics of heavy quark production , and the values of several fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "these events are produced most commonly in charged - current ( cc ) neutrino dis interactions when the incoming neutrino scatters off a strange or down quark to produce a charm quark in the final state , which subsequently fragments into a charmed hadron that decays semi - muonically .",
    "this distinct signature is easy to identify and measure in massive detectors , which allows for the collection of high statistics data samples .",
    "consequently , dimuon events have played a significant role in the last 20 years in understanding charm production in dis@xcite .",
    "since the contribution of the down quark to charm production is cabibbo suppressed , scattering off a strange quark is responsible for a significant fraction of the total dimuon rate : @xmath4 in @xmath5 and @xmath6 in @xmath7 scattering .",
    "therefore the measurement of this process provides an excellent source for the determination of the strange quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the nucleon .",
    "other methods involving measurements of the difference in parity violating structure functions from @xmath8 and @xmath9 scattering off an isoscalar target and the ratio of parity conserving structure functions from charged lepton and neutrino dis suffer from theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties .",
    "its prominent role in dis charm production makes the @xmath10 quark pdf an important ingredient in tests of two - scale quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite , the two scales being the squared invariant momentum transfer @xmath11 and the charm mass @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath10 quark pdf also enters into background calculations for new physics searches at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "for example , in some scenarios the super - symmetric top quark @xmath13 is best searched for via its loop decay to a charm quark and a neutralino@xcite , @xmath14 .",
    "the dominant background to this mode is from the gluon - strange quark process @xmath15 , with the @xmath16 decaying leptonically .",
    "accurate separate measurement of @xmath10 and @xmath17 pdfs may also shed light on the interplay between perturbative and non - perturbative qcd effects in the nucleon@xcite .    in the following we present a new measurement of dimuon production from scattering of @xmath0 and @xmath1 beams from an iron target in the nutev experiment at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "this measurement exploits the high purity @xmath0 and @xmath1 beams produced by the fermilab sign - selected quadrupole train ( ssqt ) to extend acceptance for muons down to @xmath18 gev@xmath19 momentum without any ambiguity in the determination of the muon from the primary interaction .",
    "our analysis proceeds as follows : we first perform a fit to nutev @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimuon data using a leading order ( lo ) qcd cross - section model to obtain values for effective charm mass @xmath20 , parameters describing the size and shape of the nucleon strange and anti - strange sea , and parameters describing the fragmentation of charm quarks into hadrons followed by their subsequent semi - muonic decay .",
    "the lo parameters allow us to make contact with previous measurements and provide an accurate description of the dimuon data .",
    "we then go on to use the lo model for acceptance and resolution corrections in extracting , for the first time , the cross - sections @xmath21 for forward secondary muons tabulated in bins of neutrino energy @xmath22 , bjorken scaling variable @xmath23 , and inelasticity @xmath24 .",
    "these cross - section tables provide the most model - independent convenient representation of @xmath0 and @xmath25 dimuon data .",
    "they may be used to test any cross - section calculation for dimuon production from iron , provided that the model is augmented with a fragmentation / decay package such as that provided by pythia @xcite .",
    "we then repeat the cross - section extraction on an older ccfr data set@xcite from the same detector ; and , after demonstrating consistency between the ccfr and nutev data , we combine the cross - section tables to obtain the most statistically precise high energy neutrino dimuon production collected to date .",
    "we finish by performing a lo qcd fit to the combined cross - section tables and extract precise determinations of @xmath12 , the ckm parameter @xmath3 , and size and shape parameters for the strange sea .",
    "dimuon production from charm depends on three different components : the charm production cross - section , the fragmentation of the charm quark to a charmed hadron , and the semileptonic decay of the charmed hadron . in lo qcd",
    ", charm production arises from scattering off a strange or down quark : @xmath26 , where the second muon is produced from the semileptonic decay of the charmed hadron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lodiag ] ) . in this case , the dimuon production cross - section factorizes into the form : @xmath27 here , @xmath24 is the inelasticity , @xmath28 is the fraction of charm quark momentum carried by the charm quark hadron , and @xmath29 is the fraction of the nucleon s momentum carried by the struck quark , with @xmath23 the bjorken scaling variable and @xmath30 the nucleon mass .",
    "@xmath31 is the fragmentation function for the charm quark ; @xmath32 , the semi - muonic branching fraction for charmed hadrons ; both averaged over all charmed hadrons produced in the final state .",
    "the charm production cross - section @xmath33 for an isoscalar target @xmath34 can be expressed as    @xmath35 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 gev@xmath37 , @xmath38 gev@xmath39 , and @xmath40/@xmath3 are the @xmath41/@xmath42 ckm matrix elements .",
    "the corresponding @xmath43 process has the quarks replaced by their anti - quark partners .",
    "one observes that the non - strange contributions to the cross - section are large in neutrino mode , where they dominate at high @xmath44 ; and small in anti - neutrino mode , where @xmath45 dominates at all @xmath44 . in the case",
    "where @xmath46 , the neutrino @xmath44 distribution determines the relative size of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 contributions , the anti - neutrino @xmath44 distributions determines the shape of @xmath49 , the energy dependence of the cross - section determines @xmath12 , the ratio of the dimuon cross - section to the single muon inclusive cross - section sets @xmath32 , and the energy distribution of the charm decay muon constrains @xmath50 .",
    "the non - strange pdfs are determined from inclusive @xmath51 and @xmath52 cc scattering , and from charged lepton scattering ; they contribute negligible uncertainty to @xmath53 .",
    "the final state charmed hadron admixture is obtained from neutrino data from an emulsion experiment@xcite that has been corrected for improved knowledge of charmed hadron lifetimes@xcite .",
    "extraction of ckm matrix elements from the data requires an independent determination of @xmath32 ; this analysis uses the particle data group charm semi - leptonic branching fractions@xcite convolved with the species production cross - sections just mentioned .",
    "the result is @xmath54 .    in next - to - leading - order ( nlo )",
    "qcd , additional diagrams complicate the expression for @xmath53 and also spoil the factorization of the various components of @xmath55 .",
    "the charm production cross - section also becomes dependent on the qcd factorization and re - normalization schemes and their respective scales .",
    "in an ideal situation one would like to present direct measurements of the differential charm production cross - sections @xmath56 at several different neutrino energies .",
    "neither nutev nor its predecessor ccfr measures charm , but rather dimuons .",
    "the charm cross - section is thus related to the data by model - dependent corrections for charm fragmentation and decay and by experimental effects of resolution , acceptance , and neutrino flux .",
    "one way of handling these issues is to fit a parametric model directly to the data and extract parameters from the model .",
    "this approach was used in the past for lo qcd@xcite and nlo qcd@xcite in the variable flavor acot@xcite scheme .",
    "the approach taken here begins with the same idea , a lo qcd parametric fit based on eq .",
    "[ lo dimu ] .",

    "the `` @xmath63 '' subscript indicates that these quantities differ from the true values of @xmath23 , @xmath64 , and @xmath28 , due to the energy carried away by the neutrino from charm decay and due to detector smearing .",

    "the charm events are augmented with a contribution from dimuon production through @xmath66 decay in the charged - current neutrino interaction s hadron shower and then processed through a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the detector and the same event reconstruction software used for the data .",
    "the mc dimuon sample is normalized to the data through use of the inclusive single muon event rates in @xmath0 and @xmath1 mode .",
    "the fit varies a common charm mass @xmath12 , branching fraction @xmath32 , and fragmentation parameter @xmath67 for both modes , and two parameters for each mode , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , that describe the magnitude and shape of the @xmath10 and @xmath17 quark pdfs .",
    "the strange sea parameters are defined by @xmath70    in these parameterizations and @xmath71 in the general case of @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the motivation for not using the older definitions ( of the form @xmath74",

    "the analysis proceeds based on the observation that the dimuon data are well described by the lo fit .",
    "the information on charm production from the lo fit is , in fact , not of great importance ; our goal is to use the fit parameters to help construct a cross - section .",
    "this task is performed by forming a new grid in @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 in the data and mc , and a corresponding grid of @xmath86 and @xmath64 in the mc .",
    "the dimuon cross - section is computed at the weighted center of each @xmath87 bin @xmath88 .",
    "the mc also predicts , with the result of the lo fit , the number of events in each @xmath89 bin @xmath90 .",
    "the mc can further be used to establish a correspondence between @xmath87 and @xmath89 bins ; this is accomplished by finding the bin @xmath91 in @xmath89 space that receives the largest fraction of events produced in @xmath92 bin @xmath88 .",

    "figure [ fig : ssqt ] illustrates the sign - selection optics employed by the ssqt to pick the charge of secondary pions and kaons which determine whether @xmath0 or @xmath1 are predominantly produced .",

    "the very low `` wrong - flavor '' backgrounds@xcite imply that only one muon charge measurement is needed to make the correct assignments for @xmath59 and @xmath60 described above .",
    "the lab e detector , described in detail elsewhere@xcite , consists of two major parts , a target calorimeter and an iron toroid spectrometer .",
    "the target calorimeter contains 690 tons of steel sampled at 10  cm(fe ) intervals by 84 3 m @xmath105 3 m scintillator counters and at 20  cm(fe ) intervals by 42 3 m @xmath105 3 m drift chambers .",
    "the toroid spectrometer consists of four stations of drift chambers separated by three iron toroid magnets that provide a @xmath106 kick of @xmath107 gev@xmath19 .",
    "the toroid magnets were set to always focus the muon with same lepton number as the beam neutrino .",

    "the spectrometer s multiple - coulomb - scattering - dominated muon momentum resolution is @xmath110 @xmath111 , and the muon momentum scale is known to @xmath112 .",
    "a typical dimuon event has the characteristics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evt ] . in this figure ,",
    "the toroid can be seen to focus the leading muon originating from the leptonic vertex and to de - focus the secondary muon , which originates most probably from charm decay . in the event shown",
    "both muons pass through the toroid , and both their signs are measured . in events where the sign of one muon is not measured ,",
    "it is assumed to be opposite the one measured . since the sign of the primary muon is known because of the sign selection of the ssqt , the measurement of the sign of only one muon is sufficient to identify the primary and secondary muon in the event .",
    "the rate of the same sign dimuon events with both muons toroid analyzed is very low@xcite .",
    "candidate opposite sign dimuon events , in both data and monte carlo , were selected using the following criteria :    * the event must occur in coincidence with the beam and fire the penetration trigger ( charged - current interaction trigger ) .",

    "a hit - level monte carlo simulation of the detector based on the geant package  @xcite was used to model the detector response and provide an accurate representation of the detector geometry .",
    "the monte carlo events were analyzed using the same reconstruction software used in the data analysis .",
    "the detector response in the simulation was tuned to both hadron and muon test beam data at various energies . to ensure the accurate modeling of the muon reconstruction efficiency",

    "the total probability to produce such muons with momentum greater than 4 gev / c is @xmath139 for events with @xmath140 30 gev , and @xmath141 for @xmath142 100 gev .",
    "the contribution from the primary hadron decays is roughly two times larger than that from the secondary decays .",
    "the total flux , energy spectra , and composition for both neutrino and anti - neutrino beams are calculated using a monte carlo simulation of the beamline based on the decay turtle program  @xcite and production data from atherton  @xcite as parameterized by malensek  @xcite for thick targets .",
    "this flux is used to generate an inclusive charged - current interaction monte carlo sample using the geant based hit - level detector monte carlo described in section iv.c",
    ".    the predicted flux is then tuned so that the inclusive charged - current interaction spectra in the monte carlo match the data .",
    "selection criteria for this sample of inclusive charged - current interactions are exactly the same as those used to select the dimuon sample with the requirement for two muons removed .",
    "flux corrections of up to @xmath143 are applied in bins of neutrino energy and transverse vertex position to force the single muon data and monte carlo to agree . in addition , an overall factor is determined for each beam ( neutrino or anti - neutrino ) that absolutely normalizes the single muon monte carlo to the data .",
    "the dimuon monte carlo uses the flux determined with the above procedure ; and it is absolutely normalized to the inclusive single muon charged - current data through the flux tuning procedure .",
    "the procedure used to tune the flux to the observed single muon rate is iterative since the event rate observed in the detector depends on the convolution of the cross - section with neutrino flux , and the result of the charm measurement has a small effect on the total cross - section .",
    "corrections found from the single muon monte carlo / data comparisons are used in the dimuon monte carlo that is used to determine the dimuon cross - section , and thus the charm production cross - section within our lo model .",
    "the charm cross - section results are then used in the single muon monte carlo and the procedure is repeated until the flux parameters do not change ( in practice the convergence is very fast ) . figure [ fig:1mupl ] shows a comparison between data and monte carlo for the single muon ( flux ) sample ; the level of agreement is very good .",
    "note that muon and hadron energies are not adjusted separately in the flux tuning procedure .",
    "the lo qcd fits were performed using three different parton distribution function ( pdf ) sets with their corresponding qcd evolution kernels : grv94lo @xcite and cteq4lo@xcite , as implemented in the pdf compilation pdflib  @xcite , and a buras - gaemers parameterization@xcite ( bgpar ) that has been used extensively in this experiment and its ccfr predecessor . in the bgpar case , an explicit callan - gross relation violation is implemented by replacing the term @xmath144 in eq .",
    "[ eq : lo ] with @xmath145 , where @xmath146 , the ratio of longitudinal to transverse @xmath147 cross - sections , is taken from a fit to electroproduction data@xcite .",

    "all three models have the same good level of agreement with the dimuon data .",
    "figure [ fig : dimufit ] illustrates the quality of the bgpar fit by comparing it to the data for the kinematic variables used directly in the fit ; figure [ fig : dimuplt ] shows a comparison for variables not used directly in the fit .",
    "one observes that differences in the choice of pdf parameterization result in different charm production parameters , indicating significant model dependence at lo .",
    "because of this dependence , the most relevant quantity to extract is the dimuon production cross - section .",
    "the ccfr dimuon data set used in the ccfr lo  @xcite and nlo  @xcite analysis is used to extract lo qcd parameters using the same procedure described in the previous section .",
    "results , shown in table  [ set data fits ] , are consistent with the nutev fits except for the fragmentation function shape parameter @xmath67 .",
    "this difference is caused by the fact that in nutev a much higher percentage of low energy muons is used , thus the @xmath150 distribution has significant shape differences to that of ccfr .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty in the @xmath66 background parameterization is larger for low muon energies ; this effect is reflected in the size of the error on the determination of @xmath67 .",
    "table [ set data fits ] shows results of a combined fit to the data from both nutev and ccfr performed using the same procedure and the bgpar pdf set .",
    "since the fragmentation shape parameter is different for the two experiments , the monte carlo sample for each is reweighted to the appropriate @xmath67 and then kept fixed in the combined fit to simplify the fitting procedure .",
    "different bgpar pdf sets are used to analyze nutev and ccfr data .",
    "thus , since we have shown that different pdf sets can produce different lo parameters , the numbers presented in table  [ set data fits ] should not be compared directly with each other . furthermore , the combined fit uses the nutev bgpar pdf set , an approach that is not completely rigorous .",
    "parameters in table  [ set data fits ] should be compared to their corresponding values in table  [ set table fits ] , which gives the result of the fit to the dimuon cross - section table discussed in the next section . in this case , the use of any pdf set or model is equally appropriate , since the purpose is to compare the results of the fit to the dimuon data to those of the fit to the extracted cross - section tables .",
    "we caution readers against taking @xmath79 and @xmath81 parameters for strange seas extracted using the bgpar sets and using them to construct @xmath151 pdfs according to eqs .",
    "[ ssconstr]-[sbsconstr ] from a different pdf set .",
    "since the nutev / ccfr pdfs are not publicly available , a safer course would be to take the strange sea parameters for cteq or grv .",
    "even then , it is important to match @xmath79 and @xmath81 from our fits with the appropriate pdf set .      although the main thrust of the analysis is the extraction of the dimuon production cross - section , the various sources of systematic uncertainty are presented by listing their contributions to the lo fit parameters",
    "this is done for reasons of clarity , since the individual systematic uncertainty contributions add too many entries in the cross - section tables .",
    "these methods are completely equivalent since the systematic uncertainty on the parameters of the lo fits propagates directly to the cross - section measurement .",
    "the main sources of the systematic uncertainties arise from modeling uncertainties in the monte carlo .",
    "the most significant are the @xmath66 decay background simulation , the detector calibration from the analysis of test beam hadron and muon data as a functions of energy and position , and the overall normalization .",
    "in addition , in the case of the bgpar fits , the uncertainty on the longitudinal structure function is important .",
    "the systematic error sources are given in table  [ lo systematics ] .",
    "for the combined nutev+ccfr fit , systematic errors begin to dominate the uncertainties for several fit parameters .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , charm cross - section parameters depend on the details of the charm production model used in the fit .",
    "in addition , a fragmentation and decay model must be used to extract the charm production cross - section from the observed dimuon rate , introducing further model dependence .",
    "these model dependences are exacerbated by the experimental smearing correction , due to the missing neutrino energy of the charmed hadron decay and the detector resolution , and the substantial acceptance correction for low energy muons . in order to minimize model dependencies ,",
    "we choose to present our result in the form of a dimuon production cross - section .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that we can obtain very good description of our dimuon data , independent of the charm production model assumptions in our monte carlo .",
    "we thus limit the use of the monte carlo to correct experimental effects to the measured dimuon rate , and we limit the measurement of this rate to regions of phase space where the acceptance of the experiment is high . in this case , the only model dependence comes from potential smearing effects close to our acceptance cuts , i.e. , the uncertainty on production of events produced with kinematic variables outside our cuts that smeared to reconstructed values within the cuts .",
    "the prediction for this kind of smearing depends on the underlying physics model , which is not well constrained by our data , since it involves phase space not accessed by our data . however , this model dependence is a second order effect .",
    "the dimuon cross - section extraction procedure depends on the ability of our monte carlo to describe the data .",
    "the `` true '' three - dimensional phase space @xmath87 is divided into a number of bins .",
    "the grid is set up so that there is the same number of monte carlo events in each bin for any projection into one dimension .",
    "the cross - section for dimuon production with @xmath152 gev is calculated according to eq .",
    "[ measured xc ] at the center of gravity of each bin .",
    "the size of the bins in `` visible '' phase space @xmath89 is defined in such a way so that there is a correspondence between a visible bin @xmath91 and a generated @xmath88 established by the condition that bin @xmath91 contains at least @xmath153 of the events from bin @xmath88 . the relative error on the cross - section",
    "is taken to be equal to @xmath154 .",
    "cross - section tables were produced using all three bgpar , grv , and cteq models ; figure [ nttytab1]-[nttytab4 ] demonstrate the insensitivity of the cross - section to pdf choice .",
    "further details of the binning procedure are defined in appendix [ binstuff ] .      using the cross - section tables",
    "involves similar steps as used in the direct data analysis , but with all detector and flux dependent effects removed .",
    "one must provide a model for charm production , fragmentation , and decay ; construct the dimuon cross - section number for each entry in the table ; and perform a @xmath148 fit . the @xmath148 function should employ the statistical and systematic errors in each bin added in quadrature .",
    "one must also account for correlations between the various table entries .",
    "these correlations derive from our use of the lo fit to parameterize the data and from our method of binning ; they are an inherent consequence of the incomplete kinematic reconstruction of the dimuon final state .",
    "we have adopted a pragmatic approach towards handling this issue . rather than compute a large correlation matrix ,",
    "we inflate the cross - section errors in each bin by a factor that is typically @xmath155 this factor is chosen so that an _ uncorrelated _ @xmath148 fit to the tables returns the same parameter errors as a direct fit to the data .",
    "a consequence of this error inflation is an apparent best fit @xmath148 per bin @xmath156 that is approximately @xmath157 rather than @xmath158 .",
    "this low value results from overcounting the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) present in the table and is compensated for by using an effective dof per bin determined via mccalculation and given along with cross section data in the tables .",
    "further details of the determination of the effective dof are presented in appendix [ binstuff ] .",

    "it has also been verified that grv94 parameters , for example , can be extracted from a cross - section table constructed with either the cteq or bgpar model so as to agree with parameters obtained by fitting directly to the data .    while our cross - checks in fitting the cross - section tables entail using the same physics model used in generating the tables , we emphasize that the table presents a set of physical observables which may be used to test _ any _ dimuon production model . for",
    "the most interesting case of dimuon production through charm , a typical model test would consist of the following steps :    * for each bin , generate a ( large ) ensemble of @xmath159 events with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath160 , where @xmath160 denotes the lab momentum of the produced charm quark , according to the model charm production differential cross - section @xmath161 * fragment the charm quarks into hadrons and decay the charmed hadrons ( using , for example , pythia ) , and determine @xmath162 the number of events which have a charm decay muon with @xmath152 gev . * the cross - section to compare to the table value is then @xmath163 . *",
    "a fit should then be performed to minimize @xmath164 in each beam mode with respect to the desired parameters in @xmath165 * the confidence level for the fit may be obtained by comparing the @xmath148 to the sum of effective dof for table bins used in the fit .    to provide further experimental information for model testing",

    "these quantities are computed from the dimuon data , with the lo fit used only for acceptance and smearing corrections .",
    "tables  [ nutev nu bin1]-[ccfr nubar bin3 ] contain the measurements .",
    "appendix [ high - x - section ] contains a supplementary discussion of the cross sections at high @xmath23 .",
    "we present a measurement of the dimuon production cross - section from an analysis of the data of the nutev neutrino dis experiment at the tevatron .",
    "nutev data are combined with an earlier measurement from the ccfr experiment that used the same detector but a different beamline .",
    "a leading order qcd analysis of charm production performed on the combined data yields the smallest errors to date on model parameters describing the charm mass , the size and shape of the strange sea , and the mean semi - muonic branching fraction of charm .",
    "the leading order qcd model describes nutev and ccfr data very well , but cross - section model parameters extracted vary depending on the particular choice of model .",
    "the extracted dimuon production cross - section , by contrast , is insensitive to the choice of leading order qcd model and should be of most use to the community of phenomenologists .",
    "in this analysis we report the differential cross - sections @xmath170 for forward secondary muons tabulated in bins of neutrino energy @xmath64 , bjorken scaling variable @xmath23 , and inelasticity @xmath24 .",
    "the measurement is obtained by using a lo monte carlo fit to the data to find the correspondence ( mapping ) between the `` true '' ( unsmeared ) and reconstructed ( smeared ) phase space , as discussed in sec .",
    "this procedure maps the statistical fluctuations of the observed event rate to the `` true '' phase space bins where the cross - section is reported .",
    "the consistency of the procedure is checked by comparing fits of various models to the extracted cross - section tables to fits of the same models performed directly to the data .",
    "the criteria for the check is that the obtained central values and the errors on the model parameters are the same in both cases . in order to meet these criteria the binning of",
    "the smeared and the unsmeared phase space has to be appropriately selected .    usually in cross - section measurements , the procedure followed is to bin both the `` true '' and the reconstructed variables using the same grid , and select the bin size empirically so that for each bin the purity is maximized and the smearing contribution from other bins is minimized . in such a method the correspondence between smeared and unsmeared bins is trivial since the same grid of bins is used . in the case of the dimuon cross - section measurement ,",
    "a complication arises from the large smearing effects due to the missing neutrino energy in the reconstructed dimuon final state . unlike detector resolution effects",
    ", this smearing is not a symmetric function of the `` true , '' unsmeared variables , but rather an asymmetric mapping similar to electroweak radiative corrections . because of this effect",
    ", we have followed a more elaborate procedure to map the visible phase space bins to those of the `` true '' phase space .",
    "this procedure allows us to obtain the desired high purity for each bin and also achieve stability of the result independently of the binning choice .",
    "in addition to mapping , our procedure allows us to take into account the significant bin - to - bin correlations which arise from the large smearing corrections without having to construct a full error matrix .",
    "this correlation matrix can be calculated , but it is too unwieldy to be useful ; and it is difficult to incorporate effects of correlated systematic errors in a meaningful way . in our treatment , we estimate an effective number of degrees of freedom which allows us to obtain from an _ uncorrelated _ fit to the cross - section tables the same fit parameter errors as the ones obtained by directly fitting to the data , using the usual @xmath171 definition .",
    "we begin the description of the technique by defining more precisely the factors @xmath95 and @xmath96 from eq .",
    "[ measured xc ] . in this equation , the expression on the left hand side represents the measured cross - section for dimuon production as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath64 in bin @xmath88 of the true phase space ( with the requirement @xmath172 ) . on the right hand side",
    ", @xmath95 is the number of data events in bin @xmath88 ( which has to be determined using the monte carlo mapping procedure ) , and @xmath96 is the number of events predicted in bin @xmath88 by the lo fit . to estimate the number of data events associated with bin @xmath88 ,",
    "we start by selecting bins in generated phase space @xmath173 , requiring equal number of monte carlo events in each projection of the true ( generated ) phase space , so the number of events in each @xmath173 bin is approximately the same .",
    "the visible phase space is divided using the same algorithm but with a much finer grid than the generated space .",
    "the mapping matrix @xmath174 makes the correspondence between visible and generated phase spaces : @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the number of monte carlo events generated in bin @xmath88 which end up in visible bin @xmath90 and @xmath177 is the total number of monte carlo events in visible bin j. the coverage fraction @xmath178 in visible space is defined as @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the number of monte carlo events in generated bin @xmath88 . in the case of @xmath181",
    "the sum is performed over all visible bins ; otherwise , the summation goes over the bins with the highest @xmath182 ratios until the desired fractional coverage is obtained . using the above definitions , and for a given coverage @xmath178",
    ", we can define the number of data events which belong to a given true phase space bin @xmath88 ( where the cross - section is reported ) as @xmath183 the number of monte carlo events in this generated bin , for a given coverage @xmath178 , is redefined as @xmath184    the cross - section error for each bin @xmath88 should be proportional to the visible events `` mapped '' in that bin , so the following expression is used to assign it : @xmath185 note that the monte carlo statistics contribution comes from the total number of monte carlo events generated in bin @xmath88 . the multiplicative factor @xmath186 in eq .",
    "[ measured xc ] cancels out to first order the model dependence of the extracted cross - section and approximately transfers the statistical fluctuation in the visible phase space to the true phase space .",
    "the procedure as described above is incomplete , since the true bins @xmath88 are not statistically independent . as we stated in the introduction to this section",
    ", we do not calculate the full error matrix , but rather estimate an effective ( independent ) number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is possible to estimate the number of independent degrees of freedom by calculating the contribution to the total number of degrees of freedom from each bin @xmath187 it is obvious that the effective number of degrees of freedom depends on the selected coverage fraction @xmath178 , and should decrease as @xmath178 increases .",

    "the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : dof ] shows the @xmath148 obtained as a result of the fit to the table .",
    "we conclude that our method produces the correct number for @xmath188 , if the effective number of degrees of freedom is used , for a coverage fraction between @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the coverage area percentage used for our reported cross - section result is based on a monte carlo study . in this study",
    "a monte carlo sample is used to produce `` cross - section '' tables and then fits are performed to the tables and directly to the sample . using as guidelines the criteria that there should be no pull on fit parameters in a fit to the cross - section table versus a direct fit , and that an _ uncorrelated _ fit to the tables",
    "should yield the same fit parameter errors as the ones obtained by a direct fit , we selected a coverage area @xmath191 .",
    "the effective number of degrees of freedom which corresponds to this value should be used with all fits performed on the cross - section tables we present in this article .",
    "this section presents a supplementary investigation of the high @xmath23 region ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "the objective of this study is to ascertain whether there is any indication of an enhancement in the cross - section that we may be missing due to our use of wide @xmath23 bins ( dictated by the low observed event rate at high @xmath23 ) .",
    "such an enhancement could be caused by an unusually large strange sea , particularly in neutrino mode , which has been advocated to resolve certain discrepancies between inclusive charged lepton and neutrino scattering  @xcite .",
    "previous dimuon analyses  @xcite may have missed this effect due to dependence on the particular model used to parameterize the strange sea distribution .    in order to minimize model - dependent corrections",
    ", we report our high x cross - section measurements as fractions of the total dimuon cross - section . similarly , to quote a limit for the @xmath192 cross - section we use the observed data rate for @xmath193 .",
    "this is a conservative way to set a limit , since by the kinematic effect of the missing decay neutrino energy , the contribution to a given @xmath83 bin always comes from @xmath194 .",

    "[ equ : highx ] . here",
    "the monte carlo prediction is very well constrained by our dimuon data in the full @xmath23 range , since the observed rate is mostly due to scattering on @xmath17 quarks .",
