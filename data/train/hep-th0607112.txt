    "in the traditional approach to quantum field theory , one starts from classical fields and a lagrangean which describes the interaction .",
    "these objects get quantized and @xmath0-matrix elements or greens functions are constructed with the help of the feynman rules .",
    "a typical example which is used in this paper as a model theory is the massless @xmath1-theory , where the interaction hamiltonian density is given by the normal ordered third order monomial of a free uncharged massless scalar field and a coupling constant @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an element of minkowski space , denoted by @xmath5 in the following .",
    "the perturbative @xmath0-matrix is then constructed according to the expansion @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the time - ordering operator .",
    "it must be pointed out that the perturbation series eq .",
    "( [ stoer1 ] ) is formal and it is difficult to make any statement about the convergence of this series .",
    "furthermore , two problems arise in the expansion given above .",
    "first , the time - ordered products @xmath8 are usually plagued by ultraviolet divergences .",
    "however , these divergences can be removed by regularization , such that the operator - valued distributions @xmath9 can be viewed as well - defined , already regularized expressions .",
    "second , infrared divergences are also present in eq .",
    "( [ stoer1 ] ) .",
    "this is not astonishing , since the @xmath9 s are operator - valued distributions , and therefore must be smeared out by test functions in @xmath10 , the schwartz space of functions of rapid decrease .",
    "one may therefore introduce a test function @xmath11 which plays the role of an adiabatic switching and provides a cutoff in the long - range part of the interaction , which can be considered as a natural infrared regulator @xcite .",
    "then the infrared regularized @xmath0-matrix is given by @xmath12 and an appropriate adiabatic limit @xmath13 must be performed at the end of actual calculations in the right quantities ( like cross sections ) where this limit exists .",
    "this is not one of the standard strategies usually found in the literature , however , it is the most natural one in view of the mathematical framework used in perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "the vertex diagram appears in @xmath1-theory at third order of perturbation theory via @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is given by the scalar feynman propagator discussed below in further detail .",
    "of course , the massless vertex functions plays also a prominent role in applied quantum field theories like qcd , where it emerges in the three - gluon vertex @xcite , or in perturbative models of quantum gravity .    in this paper ,",
    "the fourier transform of the massless vertex distribution ( also called vertex function in the sequel ) @xmath17 @xmath18[(q - k)^2+i0][k^2+i0 ] } \\label{vertextrafo}\\ ] ] will be calculated in a non - standard manner by making explicit use of causality as a fundamental property of local quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "the presented dispersive method is based on considerations in configuration space and integrals in momentum space are not evaluated by the help of wick rotations .",
    "furthermore , no mass terms are needed as regulators of infrared divergences , the vertex function is constructed directly without any limiting procedure .",
    "it should be noted that the vertex function is translation invariant in the sense that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an arbitrary four - vector .",
    "this symmetry property can be inferred directly from the decomposition of the vertex function into three feynman propagators given above . introducing new integration variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the fourier transform in eq .",
    "( [ vertextrafo ] ) can also be written as ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 @xmath25 which shows that @xmath26 does indeed not depend on @xmath27 .",
    "the focus of this work is on the causal and analytic properties of the vertex function and its infrared - finite dispersive calculation in the massless case .",
    "the more involved general - mass case of the vertex function has been treated by t hooft and veltman @xcite , such that results for the massless case could be obtained by considering the appropriate limit .",
    "an explicit result for the massless case has been given in @xcite , and a discussion of the vertex function within a special framework based on a geometrical interpretation of kinematic invariants and other quantities of one - loop diagrams is contained in @xcite , where a short overview over different calculational methods for one - loop n - point functions can also be found .    before investigating the causal structure of the scalar vertex function , some important analytic properties of the feynman propagator and other related tempered distributions will be recalled in the following section .",

    "a further crucial observation is the fact that one can introduce the retarded propagator @xmath45 which coincides with @xmath46 on @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 holds for all test functions in the schwartz space @xmath49 with support @xmath50 .",
