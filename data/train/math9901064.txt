    "we deal with the problem of finding the degree of the divisor of solutions of a differential equation on a projective variety , which was studied by halphen in  @xcite for differential equations on plane curves and on hypersurfaces of @xmath0 . with the notion of infinitesimal data in @xmath0 , introduced in the plane by a. collino  @xcite , used by s. colley and g. kennedy in  @xcite  @xcite , and generalised to higher dimensions in  @xcite",
    ", we solve this problem for algebraic subvarieties of @xmath0 ( the method of halphen seems to generalise only to complete intersections ) .",
    "the plane data of collino have been rediscovered by mohamed belghiti  @xcite and applied to give a modern proof of the halphen formula for plane curves , including some explicit calculation of the involved invariants of the equation that halphen was able to obtain in this case .",
    "let @xmath0 the complex projective space of dimension @xmath3 ( although we can work over any algebraically closed field @xmath4 of zero characteristic ) .",
    "associated to a set of coordinates @xmath5 on an affine open set @xmath6 , we construct inductively an open set @xmath7 of the data scheme @xmath8 , where the partial derivatives of the @xmath9 with respect to the @xmath10 are understood as the canonical coordinates of @xmath7 . in this context , a differential equation @xmath11 is understood as a algebraic equation on the open set @xmath7 .",
    "the data satisfying the differential equation form a divisor @xmath12 on @xmath8 defined as the closure of the solutions to @xmath13 . for the differential equation @xmath14",
    "there are naturally well defined enumerative invariants @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be an algebraic subvariety of dimension @xmath18 , then @xmath19 will be the locus of the solutions of the differential equation @xmath13 on @xmath2 .",
    "the main result of the paper ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) gives a closed formula for @xmath20 ( assuming @xmath19 is a proper subset of @xmath2 ) , expressed as the scalar product between the @xmath15 and the cuspidal numbers @xmath21 of @xmath2 .",
    "this reduces to a simple formula @xmath22 when @xmath2 is smooth ( or normal ) , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the degree and class of @xmath2 respectively , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be computed directly , either with the use of proposition  [ prop:7 ] or remark  [ rem : util ] ( when @xmath14 is distinguished in suitable variables , which is the general case ) or by using the formula @xmath22 applied to a smooth quadric and a smooth cubic subvarieties @xmath1 , and solving the system of linear equations thus obtained .",
    "the use of theorem  [ thm : main ] is two - fold . on the one hand it gives the degree of @xmath19 if we know enough information from @xmath14 and @xmath2",
    "this can be used to understand geometric properties of @xmath2 as these are usually described by a suitable differential equation ( e.g.  flexes of plain curves , parabolic points ) . on the other hand",
    "the explicit computations of @xmath20 in particular cases may lead to finding the invariants @xmath27 of a differential equation @xmath14 , and the cuspidal numbers @xmath21 of a subvariety @xmath2 .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] is devoted to examples in which these two applications of theorem  [ thm : main ] are worked out . in particular , we find the degree of the divisor of parabolic points of a subvariety of @xmath0 .    finally in the last section we extend the results for the real projective space @xmath28 , by studying the behaviour of the constructions involved via the conjugation involution .",
    "this is merely an introduction and not a thorough analysis of the use of data varieties in the real case .",
    "the formula thus obtained in theorem  [ thm : main2 ] is analogue to the one in the complex case , but we have to restrict ourselves to coefficients in @xmath29 .",
    "we end up with a simple application on the number of umbilical points of a real surface in @xmath30 .",
