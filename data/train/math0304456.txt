    "intuitively , a rearrangement is simply a change ( i.e. rearrangement ) of an orbit from the arrangement @xmath12 to the arrangement @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "one can formalize such a rearrangement in three different ways .",

    "for each orbit @xmath51 , a rearrangement @xmath33 also gives rise to a natural map @xmath52 ( not a bijection though ) , given by @xmath53 visually , regarding @xmath54 laid out by @xmath12 as a copy of @xmath0 , @xmath55 translates the point at position @xmath56 to position @xmath57 .",

    "we now consider three pseudometrics on the set of rearrangements .",
    "these all arise from natural topologies on functions @xmath52 .",
    "as @xmath0 is countable the only reasonable topology is the discrete one , using the discrete 0,1 valued metric .",

    "the metric @xmath70 on @xmath39 gives the restricted product topology and makes @xmath39 a complete metric space .",
    "we can use this to define a complete @xmath82 metric on arrangements :    @xmath83 as @xmath84 and @xmath85 we see that this is a metric .",
    "we can also define a metric similar to @xmath70 on @xmath40 itself making it a complete metric space by just taking half of the terms in @xmath70 : @xmath86 this also leads to an @xmath82 metric on @xmath40-valued functions on a measure space :    @xmath87    these two @xmath82 distances now give us two families of @xmath82 distances on the full - group , one a metric the other a pseudometric , associated with an arrangement @xmath12 :    @xmath88 and @xmath89    the * weak * @xmath82 distance , @xmath90 , is only a pseudometric but the * strong * @xmath82 distance , @xmath91 , is a metric .    to describe the weak*-distance between two arrangements let @xmath92 be the one point compactification of @xmath0 .",
    "now @xmath93 is a compact metric space and hence the borel probability measures on @xmath93 , which we write as @xmath94 , are a compact and convex space in the weak * topology .",
    "let @xmath95 be an explicit metric giving this topology .",
    "we define the distribution pseudometric between two rearrangements by @xmath96    we can combine the two @xmath82-metrics on arrangements and the full group to define a product metric on rearrangements in the form    @xmath97 we end this section by relating this complete @xmath82-metric on rearrangements to the distribution pseudometric .",
    "we now define the notion of a * size * @xmath98 on rearrangements @xmath33 as a family of pseudometrics @xmath99 on the full - group satisfying some simple relations to the metrics and pseudometrics we just defined .",
    "a size is a function @xmath100 such that , if we write @xmath101 then @xmath98 satisfies the following three axioms .    for each @xmath102 , @xmath103 is a pseudometric on @xmath29 .    for each @xmath102 ,",
    "the identity map @xmath104 is uniformly continuous .",
    "in particular this means that if @xmath105 then the two arrangements @xmath106 and @xmath107 are identical .",
    "@xmath98 is upper semi - continuous with respect to the distribution metric .",
    "that is to say , for every @xmath108 , there exists @xmath109 , such that if @xmath110 then @xmath111 .",
    "this last condition implies that if the two measures @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the same , then @xmath114 .",
    "hence the value @xmath98 is well defined on those measures on @xmath40 which arise as such an image , and we can write    @xmath115    we can now define @xmath98-equivalence of two arrangements .",
    "we say @xmath12 and @xmath46 are @xmath98-equivalent arrangements if there exist @xmath116 which are @xmath99-cauchy , @xmath117 are @xmath118-cauchy and @xmath119 converges in probability to @xmath46",
    ".    one can now define @xmath98-equivalence of actions on distinct spaces as meaning there are conjugate versions of the actions as arrangments on the same orbit space where the arrangements are @xmath98-equivalent in the sense of the definition .",
    "we now give a list of examples to indicate the range of equivalence relations that can be brought under this perspective .",
    "many examples of sizes have the common feature of being integrals of some pointwise calculation of the distortion of a single orbit . to make this precise we first review some material about bijections of @xmath0",
    "remember that @xmath120 is the space of all bijections of the group @xmath0 with the product topology , @xmath39 is the space of bijections fixing @xmath121 and we metrized both with a complete metric @xmath70 . the group @xmath0 can be regarded as a subgroup of @xmath120 acting by left multiplication , ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the map @xmath41 given by @xmath123 is a contraction in @xmath70 .",
    "also @xmath0 acting by right multiplication conjugates @xmath120 to itself giving an action of @xmath0 on @xmath120 .",
    "( @xmath124 ) we view this action by representing an element @xmath125 by a map @xmath61 , @xmath126 .",
    "those maps @xmath127 that arise from bijections are a @xmath128 and hence a polish space we call @xmath129 .",
    "the map @xmath130 is obviously a homeomorphism from @xmath120 to @xmath129 . for @xmath131 let @xmath132 be the associated bijection and for @xmath133 let @xmath134 be the associated name in @xmath40 .",
    "the action of @xmath0 on @xmath120 in its representation as @xmath129 is the shift action @xmath135 any rearrangement pair @xmath33 then gives rise to an ergodic shift invariant measure on this polish subset of @xmath40 and any ergodic shift invariant measure is an ergodic action of @xmath0 with a canonical rearrangement pair .",
    "the probability measures on a polish space are weak * polish and hence the invariant and ergodic measures on this polish space are weak * polish .",
    "we will now define a general class of sizes that arise as integrals of valuations made on the bijections @xmath136 .",
    "a borel @xmath137 is called a * size kernel * if it satisfies :    1 .",

    "@xmath139 3 .",

    "the equivalence class will be simply the full group orbit and for the other it will be the entire set of arrangements . both of the pseudometrics @xmath150 and @xmath151 are easily seen to be size kernels and so both @xmath152 are sizes .",
    "as @xmath70 makes @xmath120 complete , relative to @xmath153 sequence @xmath154 is @xmath155 cauchy iff @xmath156 in probability .",
    "thus @xmath157 iff @xmath158 i.e. they differ by an element of the full group and the equivalence class of @xmath12 is exactly its full group orbit . as for @xmath159 , for any @xmath12 and @xmath46 one can construct a sequence of @xmath116 with @xmath160 in @xmath82 with the sequence @xmath116 an @xmath99 cauchy sequence .",

    "we begin with a metric on @xmath164 given by @xmath165 ( assuming @xmath166 ) .",
    "what is important about @xmath167 are the following two properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath167 is a metric on @xmath164 bounded by 1 and 2 .",
    "@xmath168 and @xmath169 are @xmath167 close iff the norm of their difference is small in proportion to both of their norms .    for @xmath170 set @xmath171 ( those elements of @xmath172 mapped into @xmath172 by @xmath173 ) . now set @xmath174 now set @xmath175",

    "imply that this size yields even kakutani equivalence .",
    "for @xmath177 it is leads to an analogous equivalence relation among katok cross - sections of @xmath178-actions .",
    "our last example moves beyond size kernels .",
    "we discuss this example only for actions of @xmath179 although the ideas extend to general countable amenable groups .",
    "the size at its base will simply be the entropy of the rearrangment itself .",

    "up to conjugacy we can regard all ergodic actions of infinite discrete and amenable groups as residing on the same orbit space , so beyond ergodicity no dynamical property will be preserved by orbit equivalence . on the other hand , many dynamical properties have versions  relative to \" an invariant sub @xmath4-algebra and many such properties are indeed invariant under orbit equivalences that are measurable with respect to that sub @xmath4-algebra .",
    "this method first arose in work with b. weiss showing that actions of discrete amenable groups that have completely positive entropy ( cpe ) , commonly called @xmath3-systems , are mixing of all orders .",
