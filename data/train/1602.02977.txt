    "interacting sne exhibit a wide range of radiative properties , covering extremes that include both super - luminous events and  impostors \" .",
    "this diversity of bolometric displays reflects variations in the power source , and in the context of interacting sne , this is controlled by the outer shell mass and the inner shell energy ( we will loosely refer to the outer shell as circumstellar material ; csm ) . more perplexing is the diversity of spectra associated with interacting sne .",
    "multi - dimensional effects acting both on small scale ( e.g. , to produce clumping ) and large scale ( e.g. , an asymmetric csm ) may play a role .",
    "however , a large variation of both inner and outer shell properties in spherically - symmetric interactions can alone produce a wealth of peculiar spectral signatures .",
    "multiple regions are likely to contribute simultaneously to the escaping radiation , including the unshocked cool csm , the ionised unshocked csm , the interacting region between the reverse and the forward shocks ( which contains both shocked csm and shocked ejecta material , and bounds the cold dense shell , cds ) , as well as the inner ejecta in homologous expansion .",
    "these distinct regions generally have different temperatures , density , velocity , and they may also possess a different composition . because of the evolving structure of the interaction , the emitting regions at early times may be very distinct from those that contribute at late times .",
    "consequently , one expects significant spectral evolution from sne iin .    interacting sne are notoriously known for their spectral line profiles which exhibit narrow cores and broad wings .",
    "this is the specific signature seen at early times when the sn is discovered and the classification as iin stems from that observation alone @xcite .",
    "a few well known and recent examples are sn 1998s @xcite , 1994w @xcite , 2006tf @xcite , 2009kn @xcite , 2010jl @xcite , or 2011ht @xcite .",
    "this special line profile morphology is controlled by the low velocity of the csm which gives rise to the narrow component , and by scattering with thermal electrons .",
    "in sne iin the importance of electron scattering as a line broadening mechanism is enhanced by the large electron scattering optical depth , the larger sobolev lengths ( since the velocities are smaller ) , and the smaller bulk velocities which can be smaller than the characteristic speed of thermal electrons ( of the order of 550@xmath2 ) . car ; @xcite ) . ]",
    "modelling of this process in the sn context gives support to this interpretation @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     however , the relative spectral uniformity of sne iin ( with line profiles showing narrow cores and broad symmetric wings ) holds only at early times",
    ". eventually their spectra start showing very diverse line profiles , in some cases unique .",
    "so far , the modelling of sne iin spectra has been focused on the early epochs when the spectra show the distinct  iin \" signature . but to build a consistent picture of interacting sne it is crucial to understand the entire evolution , from early to late times . as we discuss here , the late - time line profiles offer key constraints , not available at early times when the optical depth is large and frequency redistribution through electron scattering is strong .    here",
    ", we focus on the behaviour of line - profile widths after maximum light and demonstrate how line - profile morphology can be used to distinguish interacting models , thereby lifting the degeneracy inherent to sn light curves . specifically , we want to understand what distinguishes events like sn1998s or sn2010jl , which show broad emission lines at late times  and in particular h@xmath3 , from events like sne 1994w , 2009kn , or 2011ht which show narrow line profiles that become systematically narrower with time .",
    "this issue emerged in @xcite when modelling sn1994w . although our models were not based on hydrodynamical simulations , we reproduced the spectral evolution of the event by invoking slow emitting material at _ all times _ and we noted the remarkable absence of broad lines .",
    "this suggested that while fast material may have been present early on , it must have been quickly decelerated to a low velocity , or that this fast material was somehow dark ( i.e. , had a low emissivity ) , or that at all times all emission from the fast - moving material was reprocessed by the slowly moving csm ( i.e. , because of an optical depth effect ) .    in the model proposed by @xcite , a sn ejecta of 7 - 12  rams into a 0.4  extended shell , producing a light curve similar to sn1994w",
    ". in this model ,",
    "the energy / momentum is stored primarily in the inner shell .",
    "the moderate deceleration of the inner shell by the outer shell leads to a moderate luminosity boost compared to standard non - interacting sne .",
    "it also leads to the formation of a cds moving at @xmath04000 , which implies that a lot of fast moving material survives the interaction with the csm .",
    "in contrast , the model of @xcite predicts an h@xmath3 line width of the order of 1000throughout the high - brightness phase of sn1994w , including late times when the csm optical depth in their model is below unity .",
    "this result is surprising , because their hydrodynamical model predicts a fast moving cds : photons emitted from the cds are doppler shifted and this should eventually become noticeable in the emerging radiation as doppler - broadened line profiles .",
    "doppler - broadened profiles are seen ( and explained ) at late times in some sne iin , for example 2010jl @xcite , so this mechanism is not unexpected in interacting sne .",
    "since sn1994w was discovered , other sne have been identified with similar properties , in particular sn2009kn @xcite and sn2011ht @xcite .",
    "sn2011a seems to be analogous to these events too @xcite .",
    "a separate sn iin - p classification has been proposed for these events @xcite . here",
    ", we wish to explore what hydrodynamical configurations can produce this distinct class of events .",
    "besides modelling light curves , which offer ambiguous constraints when used alone , we also study the spectral evolution of our radiation - hydrodynamical models .",
    "we use the same numerical approach as in @xcite for the study of super - luminous interacting sne like sn2010jl . starting from various initial configurations , we perform multi - group radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the interaction between an inner shell and an outer shell .",
    "we then post - process these radiation hydrodynamical simulations ( reading off the radius , velocity , temperature , and density of the simulated domain at a given epoch ) with the non - local - thermodynamic - equilibrium ( nlte ) code . as in @xcite , the radiative transfer works for an arbitrary velocity field and",
    "can therefore retain the complex dynamical properties of the interaction region . because the simulation with  assumes steady - state , we repeat the calculation for multiple epochs to capture the spectral evolution of the interacting sn model .    in the next section we provide a brief summary of the numerical procedure , in particular the small improvements over the approach presented in @xcite . in section  [ sect_obs ] , we give the sources of observational data we use , as well as the adopted distance , reddening , and explosion time . in section  [ sect_moda ] , we start by revisiting the model of @xcite , which involves an energetic massive inner shell ramming into a low mass extended csm .",
    "we show how that model is more suitable to explain events like sn1998s .",
    "we then present , in section  [ sect_grid ] , a grid of simulations in which we vary the inner and outer shell properties to identify a configuration compatible with the observations of sn1994w . in section  [ sect_modc ] , we propose a scenario for sn1994w .",
    "it involves an energetic low - mass inner shell that is much less massive than the slow moving massive outer shell .",
    "the reversed mass balance between inner / outer shells gives rise to a number of interesting properties that can help explain the light curve and spectra of events like sn1994w .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , various aspects of this scenario may be encountered in the final stages of evolution of 9 - 11  stars .",
    "while we were finalizing this manuscript and preparing for submission , a study of sn2011ht by @xcite came out .",
    "his approach is very different from ours but our respective conclusions agree  the simulations and results presented here have been obtained over the past year and our conclusions have not been influenced by @xcite .",

    "is a eulerian multi - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamics code @xcite , with the possibility for multi - group radiation transport @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics is treated using a standard second order godunov scheme . for the radiation transfer , the multi - group m1 moment model @xcite is used . in all  simulations ,",
    "we adopt a uniform h - rich composition suitable for the study of sne iin . in practice",
    ", we use a h mass fraction of 0.633 , he mass fraction of 0.36564 , and an iron mass fraction of 0.00136 . instead of assuming an ideal gas , we use a general equation of state that accounts for the contributions from atoms , ions , and electrons , including the contribution from ionisation energy .",
    "we have done comparison tests with simulations that adopt an ideal gas equation of state and we find small differences only , probably because the shocked low - density plasmas studied here are radiation dominated  the thermal energy is a small fraction of the energies ( radiation or kinetic ) involved .",
    "thermodynamic quantities ( energy , pressure , sound speed , heat capacity , temperature ) are tabulated in density - temperature and density - energy space for convenient use in .",
    "as in @xcite , we supply the code with an opacity table for our adopted composition .",
    "we compute our opacities as a function of density , temperature and energy group .",
    "energy groups are positioned at strategic locations to capture the strong variation in absorptive opacity with wavelength .",
    "we use one group for the entire lyman continuum ( including the x - ray range ) , two groups for the balmer continuum , two for the paschen continuum , and three groups for the brackett continuum and beyond .",
    "our  simulations are 1-d and use a uniform radial grid with 1200 - 2400 cells ( more grid cells are employed when the radial coverage is larger ) .",
    "such a resolution is sufficient to model adequately the overall dynamics and energetics of the interaction and study the spectral properties with .",
    "the initial configuration of the interaction is produced in various ways . in all cases",
    ", we consider interactions between two shells at large distances  the junction between the inner and outer shells is far beyond the initial radius of the progenitor star , and typically in the range 0.21.8@xmath410@xmath5 cm .",
    "the parameter space is large so other configurations will be considered later",
    ".    the internal energy budget at the onset of interaction will differ whether we consider eruptions / explosions from blue - supergiant ( bsg ) or red - supergiant ( rsg ) stars because of the different magnitude of expansion cooling . in @xcite",
    ", we ignored such considerations because we focused on super - luminous sne iin , events in which the power released by the interaction completely overwhelms the internal energy of the inner and outer shells at the onset of interaction .",
    "this may no longer hold when considering sne iin with a luminosity closer to non - interacting sne .",
    "as we ignore any radiation from the system emitted prior to the onset of interaction our results underestimate the true luminosity from the system at early times .",
    "this matters if one is concerned with the quantitative aspects of the problem ; here we are more focused on understanding the fundamental qualitative differences between sne iin .",
    "one can recall for example the strong offset in bolometric light curve between sn1994w and sn2011ht , while the two events show a similar spectral evolution .    in practice ,",
    "we use two different approaches for the initial setup .",
    "the first one , also used in @xcite , is simplistic since we set analytically the values for the fluid quantities ( our choices are guided by simulations of core collapse sne , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is used in section  [ sect_moda ] .",
    "one drawback is that we have to guess the initial temperature .",
    "if the outer shell arises from a pre - sn wind located at large distances , its age is old , and its temperature is low  how low is irrelevant and we just adopt our floor temperature of 2000k .",
    "if the outer shell arises instead from a recent ejection , the temperature may still be high , i.e. , well above the recombination temperature of hydrogen .",
    "further , the structure of the outer shell may also be significantly affected by radiation arising from the inner shell emitted prior to the onset of interaction .",
    "for the inner shell , a proper account of the ejecta energy / temperature is relevant because the interaction may start when the ejecta is still hot and optically thick .    in sections",
    "[ sect_grid][sect_modc ] , we use a more physical approach for the initial setup .",
    "we prepare initial conditions for the  simulations using  @xcite and 1d  @xcite . in practice , we evolve a massive star from the main sequence until the bsg phase , the rsg phase , or until core - collapse .",
    "we then trigger an explosion / eruption as desired , by depositing a prescribed energy at a prescribed radius / mass cut and on a very small time scale .",
    "we then let the resulting ejecta evolve until it reaches the desired radius for our interaction setup .",
    "the approach is still artificial in the sense that we do not model the explosion mechanism , but given that trigger , the model is energetically and dynamically consistent .    in the present simulations , we ignore @xmath6ni and any contribution from radioactive decay , so that radiation originates from the release of internal ( i.e. , primarily radiation ) energy originally present in the inner / outer shell and from direct ( or re - processed ) emission from the shock .",
    "to post - process the  simulations , we perform steady - state nlte radiative - transfer simulations with , with allowance for arbitrary velocity fields . at multiple epochs , we remap the radius , velocity , temperature and density computed by  for a wide range of interaction configurations and solve for the radiative transfer by holding the temperature fixed .",
    "the rate equations are solved using the sobolev approximation .",
    "more quantitative calculations will require the inclusion of line blanketing , and the adoption a more realistic nlte cooling function in the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the assumption of steady state in  implies that we ignore the light - travel time to the outer boundary and any explicit delay associated with optical - depth effects .",
    "however , because  uses the temperature structure from , time delays associated with the diffusion of radiation through the optically thick ejecta / csm are taken into account .",
    "because  explicitly allows for time dependence , there is an inherent time offset , of the order of a few days around bolometric maximum , between the escaping radiation at a given time in  and its computation with  based on the  snapshot at that time .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we employ a more complex model atom , including h , he , he , c  c , n , o , o , na , si , ca , sc , ti , and fe. we use a modest number of levels for each atom / ion ( comparable to the simulations reported in @xcite ) because our focus is on the spectral evolution  we search for signatures of the interaction dynamics on the h@xmath3 profile morphology so that the exact magnitude of line blanketing , for example , does not need to be known accurately for our purposes .",
    "we compare our models to sn1994w , sn1998s , and sn2001ht .    for sn1994w ,",
    "the photometry is from @xcite , combined with spectra from @xcite .",

    "each figure contains five panels illustrating the gas temperature , the velocity , the mass density , the optical depth , and the radiative luminosity versus radius .",
    "the early evolution is quite typical of interacting sne @xcite .",
    "the initial shock luminosity gives rise to a burst of radiation at the ejecta / csm interface , which propagates through the cold and dense csm on a free - flight time .",
    "radiation raises the ionisation of the csm , enhancing its electron - scattering optical depth . by 2.0d after the onset of the interaction , the csm is optically thick out to @xmath92.0@xmath410@xmath5 cm ( this is where the electron - scattering optical depth integrated inwards from @xmath10 is equal to 2/3  we define this location as the photosphere ) , and the total csm electron - scattering optical depth is of the order of 10 ( these different regions are clearly identified in fig .",
    "[ fig_map_moda ] ) .",
    "subsequently , radiation injected at the shock has to diffuse through the csm .",

    "in contrast , the photosphere has essentially not moved because it resides in the slowly moving csm , but the cds is now much closer to that photosphere .",
    "indeed , the csm electron - scattering optical depth ( between the photosphere and the cds ) is only of a few .",
    "all the energy is emitted from the cds region so that the luminosity is constant beyond it , in particular between the cds and the photosphere .    at 40.0d after the onset of the interaction ( left column of fig .",

    "its temperature is about 10000k , and it is characterised by a very steep density profile . for an external observer , the sn would look like a radiating sphere with no extension , i.e. , with a very sharp edge .",
    "up until that time , the luminosity of all energy groups shows a pronounced jump across the cds , implying that the bulk of the radiation emerges from the cds  the emitting region is moving outwards with a typical velocity of 3500 .    at 80.0d after the onset of the interaction ( right column of fig .",

    "the cds is optically thick to lyman continuum photons but is transparent to balmer continuum photons . from 5060d",
    "onwards , the luminosity shows only a modest jump across the cds , implying that the bulk of the radiation now comes from the inner ejecta , which has not taken part ( and will not take part ) in the interaction .",
    "these emitting layers are moving at a few 1000 .",
    "the bolometric light curve therefore shows two distinct phases ( fig .",

    "this second phase corresponds to the plateau light curve that this model would have had in the absence of the interaction  the contribution from the cds and the interaction during that second phase is modest ( it depends on the wind mass loss rate for the outer csm , which is chosen here to be small ) .      the second part of our study is to post - process these  simulations with , following the procedure discussed in @xcite and outlined in section  [ sect_setup ] .",

    "quantitatively , model a shows some offsets with the observations of sn1998s .",
    "the model light curve is too faint initially , but this could be remedied by adjusting the location of the csm ( closer to the progenitor star , as in @xcite ) as well as accounting for the ejecta radiation released since shock break out ( we only start accounting for radiative losses at the onset of the interaction ) .",
    "the model light curve is also too faint at late times , but this could be remedied by adopting a higher mass loss rate for the distant csm ( or invoking some power from radioactive decay ) .",
    "so , both offsets could be cured by simple adjustments to the adopted interaction configuration .",

    "indeed , given a radiation energy @xmath14 stored in the optically - thick csm volume @xmath13 the gas temperature ( which equates roughly the radiation temperature ) will scale as @xmath15 .",
    "so , the closer the interaction site is to the progenitor surface , the higher the csm temperature and ionisation , all else being the same . in the future",
    ", we will design a more suitable model to match the observed properties of sn1998s , by adjusting the velocity and density structure of the adopted csm , as well as the properties of the underlying ejecta ( in the absence of interaction , sn1998s would have been a ii - l , not a ii - p ) .",
    "these discrepancies are merely small quantitative offsets and we conclude that the model of @xcite , or our model a , is more suitable to explain events like sn1998s . the fundamental conflict between this model and the observations of sn1994w is that it systematically leads to the production of broad lines at late times , something that we already emphasised , without proof , in @xcite .    in their modelling of h@xmath3 for sn1994w , @xcite adopted free expansion for the csm with a value of 1100  at 5.4@xmath410@xmath5 cm ( any emission occurring at smaller radii arises from slower regions ) .",
    "they do not seem to consider emission from the fast moving cds at @xmath03500  ( all emission seems to arise from within the slow moving csm ) and the strongly non - monotonic velocity structure of this configuration .",
    "this likely explains the origin of the relatively narrow h@xmath3 profiles they produce , even at 89d when the csm optical depth is merely 0.54 .",
    "at such a low optical depth , the csm material can not efficiently absorb and re - emit the photons arising from the cds . in our simulations",
    ", we include the whole system ( i.e. , unshocked ejecta , shocked ejecta , shocked csm , unshocked csm ) , and find that the contribution from the ejecta and/or cds eventually dominates in this configuration when the csm optical depth drops below a few .",
    "the associated signature is the production of broad lines at late times .",
    "such broad lines are seen at late times in sn1998s .",
    "for the same physical reason , they are seen ( and explained ) in sn2010jl @xcite .",
    "to determine the key inner / outer shell properties that influence the light curves and spectra of interacting sne , we perform a grid of simulations . one important goal of these simulations is to identify configurations that can produce bright displays even for low cds velocities , since we anticipate this type of configuration is warranted for sne like 1994w @xcite .",
    "for the inner shell , we consider explosions taking place in bsg and rsg stars . for the outer shell",
    ", we consider a dense csm produced by wind mass loss .",
    "because expansion cooling has a stronger effect in more compact stars , ejecta from bsg star explosions will be cooler than their rsg counterparts when they reach a distance of @xmath010@xmath5 cm ( this is a rough estimate of the interaction radius for sn1994w ) .",
    "so , to start with a suitable ejecta temperature for the inner shell , we construct bsg and rsg star models with  and explode them with 1d .",

    "one  model is saved for each stage .",
    "we then use 1d  to trigger explosions in these progenitors and evolve the resulting ejecta until they reach a desired radius where we wish them to encounter some csm . in all cases ,",
    "the energy is deposited within the h - rich envelope ( 1 to 10  below the surface ) and leads to no explosive nucleosynthesis  the ejected material retains its original ( h - rich ) composition .    to generate a diversity of interactions we consider various combinations of mass - loss rates , wind velocity , ejecta mass , and ejecta kinetic energy . for the wind phase",
    "we adopt mass - loss rates of 0.1 and 1.0  that last for one year , and which generate csm masses of 0.1 and 1 . for rsg progenitors",
    "we use a wind velocity of 60 , while for bsg progenitors we use a wind velocity of 600 . due to the larger wind velocity , and the fixed duration of the mass loss ,",
    "the outer shell thickness for the bsg case is 10 times that of the rsg shell .",
    "for the inner shell , we simulate explosions with 1d  to eject approximately 1 or 10  with an energy of about 0.05 , 0.1 , or 1.0@xmath410@xmath1erg .",

    "[ fig_lbol_bsg_rsg ] shows the bolometric luminosity computed with  for these 6 interaction models .",
    "considerable diversity is exhibited by the light curves .",
    "when the inner shell has a large energy ( models r3 and b3 ) , the high - brightness phase is very luminous .",
    "initially , the power stems from the interaction , but at later times , it can stem from the large stored energy in the inner shell . for model r3 ,",
    "the explosion is from a rsg star and , as expected , we see a normal sn ii - p luminosity of about 10@xmath16after the initial interaction - powered peak ( which lasts about 30d ) . for model b3 , the smaller progenitor star leads to a much smaller luminosity contribution at late times ( in these models of shell explosion and interaction , no ni is produced so radioactive decay is not a power source at any time ) , so the late - time light curve drops faster and is powered exclusively by the interaction .",
    "models b2 and r2 have similar ejecta masses to those of r3 and b3 , but the ejecta energy is a factor of 10 lower . as a consequence of the smaller kinetic energy the shock luminosity",
    "is much reduced and this leads to a much lower peak luminosity .",
    "the internal energy ( i.e. , left over by the original shock that produced the inner shell ) is much lower than in the r3/b3 model counterparts .",
    "this leads to a smaller contribution to the light curve , although because of the lower expansion / evolution of the whole system , the material stays optically thick longer and can be brighter at very late times ( few 100 days ) than the r3/b3 model counterparts .",
    "overall though , the lower energy models r2/b2 radiate a much lower time - integrated bolometric luminosity than models r3/b3 .    in weak explosions ,",
    "it is nonetheless possible to power a bright light curve .",
    "one way is to increase the csm mass because this enhances the conversion efficiency from kinetic energy of the inner shell into radiation .",
    "another way to boost the luminosity further is by reducing the mass of the inner shell ( i.e. , increasing the @xmath17 at fixed @xmath18 ) .",
    "the reduced inertia of the inner shell facilitates its deceleration and thus enhances the conversion efficiency .",
    "this is precisely what is achieved with models r1 and b1 .",
    "the inner shell of r1 has a kinetic energy a factor of 2 lower than r2 , and a factor of 20 lower than r3",
    ". however , model r1 reaches a peak bolometric luminosity of 2@xmath410@xmath16 , which is a factor of about 10 larger than r2 , and only a factor of 3 lower than r3 .",
    "this occurs because in r1 , 1  of ejecta is ramming into 1  of csm , and so the conversion of kinetic energy into radiative energy is very efficient .",
    "in models r2 and r3 , a 9.54  ejecta rams into a csm mass of only 0.1 .",
    "model b1 reaches a much fainter maximum than r1 because the csm wind speed is 10 times larger ( weaker shock ) and the wind density is 10 times smaller ( this is because we adopt the same wind mass loss rate as model r1 ) .",
    "however , the interaction through the more extended csm persists for longer and powers a luminosity @xmath1910@xmath20out to 250d ( the luminosity from model",
    "r1 drops below 10@xmath21  at @xmath9100d ) .",
    "compared to model b2 , model b1 has a peak luminosity a factor of 5 higher despite having a kinetic energy almost a factor of 2 lower .",
    "thus it is straightforward to produce a very luminous interacting sn with a low - energy inner shell simply by invoking a csm mass that is comparable or larger than the inner shell mass .",
    "the conversion efficiency is higher so that a larger fraction of the kinetic energy of the inner shell is extracted .",
    "the influence on the luminosity is large because a typical sn radiates a total of 10@xmath22erg , so extracting 50% of the 5@xmath410@xmath22erg kinetic energy of the inner shell can more than double the luminosity compared to a standard sn .",
    "another consequence of having an interaction between a low mass inner shell and a high mass outer shell is that fast material will not survive the interaction  the interaction will die out if the fast material in the inner shell is entirely braked . as can be seen in the right panel of fig  [ fig_lbol_bsg_rsg ] , models r3 and b3 show a cds speed of 4000 - 5000  ( comparable to the 3500  of our model a ) , while the cds speed for models r1 and",
    "b1 is only @xmath01000 .",
    "thus interactions between a low mass inner shell and a high mass outer shell , like those associated with r1 and b1 , may be able to explain events like sn1994w .    finally , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_lbol_bsg_rsg ] , the power from most of our interaction simulations is of the order of a few 10@xmath21  at @xmath0200d ( with no contribution from ni ) , and thus can alone explain the late - time luminosity of a sn iin like 2009kn @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the spectral properties of these models at different epochs with the goal of illustrating the diversity of spectral morphologies arising from different configurations . to expedite the  simulations for this section , we only include model atoms for h , he , and fe.    figure  [ fig_bsg_rsg_spec ] shows a montage of spectra for models b1 , b2 , b3 , r1 , r2 , and r3 computed with  and based on  simulations at early ( top half ) and late ( bottom half ) times after the onset of interaction .",
    "the spectra are quite disparate . at early times , all models except r3 and b3 , show the distinctive iin line profiles with a narrow core and extended symmetric wings . in model r3 at 5d and",
    "b3 at 10d , the csm optical depth is already low ( this can be indirectly inferred by the 10d rise time to bolometric maximum ; fig .",
    "[ fig_lbol_bsg_rsg ] ) .",
    "emission from the optically - thick cds is thus weakly affected by the csm and the spectra show the nearly unadulterated cds radiation . some line profiles ( e.g. ,",
    "h@xmath3 , h@xmath23 , he5875 ) exhibit weak emission and blue - shifted absorption ( the spectrum resembles that of model a at 20.0 and 34.7d ) , while he4686  forms within the cds and appears as broad and blueshifted emission . this line was not predicted in our calculations for model a because the emitting region was too cool .",

    "model r3 at 75d exhibits a spectrum more typical of a non - interacting sn ii late in the plateau phase .",
    "the skewness of the h@xmath3 profile is much reduced ( i.e. , the emission is more symmetric ) , although the peak emission is blue - shifted by about @xmath111500 . for model r3 ,",
    "the emission is primarily from the inner ejecta ( unaffected by the interaction ) , as obtained for model a at corresponding epochs .    in model b2 at 80d",
    ", the emission is primarily from the cds and gives rise to double - peaked line profiles ( probably because of an optical depth effect similar to limb darkening ) for h  and he  lines , with peaks at about @xmath241000 .",
    "the blue component is stronger , which suggests a continuum optical depth effect acting on line photons .",
    "lower energy models show narrower lines . in model r1 at 50d , the spectrum forms in the optically thick slow - moving cds and only absorption lines are seen ( this is similar to model a at 34.7d ) . in model b1 , only narrow emission lines are seen .",
    "this diversity of early / late time line profiles conveys a wealth of information on the interaction configuration .",
    "we defer to a subsequent paper the study of all these profile properties .",
    "what we take from this study is that model r1 can produce a bright display while showing broad lines neither at early times nor at late times . in the next section",
    ", we will elaborate a more suitable model that shares these properties and reflects those observed for sn1994w .",
    "in this final modelling section , we setup a more physical model to explain events like sn1994w . building upon the results from the preceding sections , the configuration we are after is a massive slow outer shell and a low / moderate mass inner shell with a modest kinetic energy ( by sn standards ) .",
    "stars in the range 8 - 12   sit at the junction between two completely different fates .",
    "the lower mass ones may ultimately produce a bare white dwarf , while the more massive ones will form a degenerate core ( made of onemg or fe - group elements ) that collapses to a neutron star @xcite .",
    "for stars just above that mass cut , o , ne , or si may ignite off - center , under degenerate conditions . if / when this occurs , burning is dynamical and leads to a nuclear flash @xcite . because the phenomenon is only encountered in the late stages of evolution , when these low - mass massive stars are in a rsg phase , even a very small energy release from nuclear burning is sufficient to eject the loosely bound envelope @xcite .",
    "if the delay until core collapse is weeks to months , the subsequent explosion will lead to an interaction between two detached shells . if the delay is short ( say , of the order of days ) , only one explosion may be seen because the sn shock will overtake the first shock before it reaches the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "such nuclear flashes have been proposed as a potential mechanism leading to interacting sne such as sn1994w @xcite .",
    "our simulations of sections  [ sect_moda][sect_grid ] show that interactions in which the inner shell is more energetic than , but less or as massive as , the outer shell can lead to a luminous sn iin event . here , we compute light curves and spectra for such configurations , and confront them with the observations of sn1994w .",
    "the possible parameter space is large since we do not know the final star mass , the energy of each explosion , nor the delay between them  significant variations are to be expected for these quantities .",
    "so , our model is one realisation out of many possibilities , but it is chosen to match roughly what was inferred for sn1994w .",
    "in particular the interaction must take place at a large distance from the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "we need the inner shell to be less massive than the outer shell and to have a larger kinetic energy ( sections  [ sect_moda][sect_grid ] ) .    because of off - center ignition ( in particular of ne )",
    ", we could not evolve any  model for an @xmath2512  star until core collapse .",
    "so , we use instead a higher mass model of 12  and enhance the mass loss during the rsg phase to compensate for the higher initial mass .",
    "our 12  model has then a final mass of 9.87  and a final radius of 520(our conclusions would hold if these values were changed by few 10% ) . using 1d  and",
    "starting from this model , we first trigger a 10@xmath22erg explosion at the base of the h - rich envelope ( outer edge of the he core ) , at a mass cut of 3.5  and let this ejecta evolve to late times .",
    "we then trigger a 10@xmath26erg explosion in this h - deficient remnant .",
    "we use a mass cut of 3.1(and not 1.4 - 1.5 ) because this second explosion is meant to mimic core collapse of a lower - mass star , which would have a lower he - core mass than the 12  model we use .",
    "this second ejecta is then evolved to late times .",
    "we set up the interaction using both ejecta calculated with 1d . to test the influence of the initial interaction radius @xmath27 , which is connected to the timing of the two explosions",
    ", we set up a model c with @xmath28 cm , and a model d with @xmath29 cm .",
    "for the outer shell , we use the structure of the first exploded shell when its base reaches @xmath27 . for the inner shell ,",
    "we use the structure of the second exploded shell when its outer part reaches @xmath27 .",
    "we join the two shells at that radius @xmath27 . because each shell was exploded and evolved with the radiation - hydrodynamics code 1d , the fluid variables ( radius , velocity , density , temperature ) are physically consistent .",

    "the initial velocity , density and temperature structures are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig_modc_init][fig_modd_init ] in the appendix .",
    "when setting up the interaction configuration , some grid zones are trimmed in the outer parts of the inner shell and the inner parts of the outer shell in order to avoid creating a gap .",
    "this explains the slight differences in mass / energy for each shell of models c and d. the inner shell is @xmath300.3  and expands very fast , with a mean mass - weighted velocity of @xmath304750 . in model c , it is only 2.3d old at the start of the interaction so the inner shell is initially hot and mostly optically thick . in model d ,",

    "the outer shell alone would exhibit a very long and faint plateau ( with a bolometric luminosity of the order of 10@xmath21 ; see the low - energy explosions of rsg stars discussed in @xcite ) .    in model",
    "a and the grid of models presented in section  [ sect_grid ] , the outer shell was formed through a phase of intense mass loss .",

    ", the outer shell is a very different type of csm ( described by an homologous expansion , a complex density structure etc ) .",
    "it is explosively formed by a nuclear flash and subsequently affected , within days to months , by the terminal collapse of the remaining star ( which in this case can only produce a very low mass ejecta made of the fraction of the he core that does not collapse into the remnant , so @xmath91  in such progenitors ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution for model c is very different from standard interacting sne  in particular the strong interaction generating the shock has ceased before the peak brightness is reached .",

    "figures  [ fig_modc_1][fig_modc_2 ] shows this evolution at selected snapshots , from 1.0 to 150.0d after the onset of the interaction .",
    "the interaction is very strong initially because the density at the base of the outer shell is @xmath010@xmath31g@xmath32 and the velocity of the fast material in the inner shell @xmath010000 .",

    "all the energy is trapped .",
    "the temperature at the base of the outer shell rises from 20000k to @xmath19100000k .",
    "as time progresses , the shock continues to progress through the outer shell , sweeping up more material and building a hot optically - thick dense shell , but the deceleration is severe . by 10d ,",
    "no material in the inner shell moves faster than 1000   the shock is essentially gone by then ( fig .",
    "[ fig_modc_1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the rest of the outer shell will not be shocked , and also that the inner parts of the inner shell will not be decelerated further .",
    "the effect of the shock has been to pile up a lot of material around 1000 , leaving slower and faster material ( dynamically ) unaffected .    within 10d , the interaction as a power source for the sn has vanished ( the shock is already weak ) .",
    "the bulk of the kinetic energy in the inner shell has been transformed into internal energy , which is primarily radiation .",
    "most of this radiation energy is trapped within the dense shell , so the subsequent radiation is the slow release of radiation energy from this optically thick ejecta . at 10.0d",
    ", the flux emerging from the dense shell is huge , much in excess of the flux radiated at the photosphere : the two will become comparable after a diffusion time of about 30d ( see , e.g. , the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_map_modc ] and fig .  [ fig_modc_2 ] ) .    before the interaction starts , the photosphere in the outer shell is at @xmath94@xmath410@xmath33 cm .",
    "once the interaction starts , the energy deposited by the shock heats up the ejecta , shifting the spectral energy distribution to the blue , facilitating the re - ionisation of the outer shell material , and pushing the photosphere out to larger radii . at 10.0d",
    ", the photosphere has moved out to @xmath04.2@xmath410@xmath33 cm , and following the ( slow ) ejecta expansion , it keeps moving out to reach @xmath01.1@xmath410@xmath5 cm at 30d , and @xmath01.6@xmath410@xmath5 cm at 100d .",
    "the thickness of the ionised material in the outer shell ( or , equivalently , the size of the region between the photosphere and the cds ) is fairly constant between 30.0 and 150.0d ( fig  [ fig_map_modc ] )  this region is co - moving with the ejecta .",
    "so , this situation is analogous to a low energy faint sn ii - p , but here energy is freshly supplied once the ejecta has expanded to a large radius , in this case beyond 2@xmath410@xmath33 cm . the fresh supply of energy boosts the sn luminosity , transforming this originally faint transient into a very luminous type ii sn .",
    "the ejecta retains its low velocity and thus , unlike a typical sn ii - p , the event is very luminous but has a low expansion rate .",
    "the very slow and dense material at the base of the outer shell has been swept up into a dense shell , undergoing an acceleration from @xmath0200  to @xmath01000 .",

    "this arises because the spectrum formation region is more confined to the recombination front , with hot / ionised material below and cool / neutral material above ( fig .",

    "initially , the absorption is partially filled - in ( the residual flux is above the continuum level ) because of photon frequency redistribution by scattering with thermal electrons . at later times ( spectra for days 130 and 160 ) , this absorption appears as a standard p - cygni absorption ( with a minimum flux below the continuum level ) .",
    "all these properties match the spectral evolution of sn1994w ( bottom panel ) , and are in stark contrast with model a ( and sn1998s ) .    despite the good agreement between the synthetic spectra of model c and the observations of sn1994w ,",

    "were it not cold and recombined , the outer shell optical depth would be @xmath1950 times lower than in model c. the characteristic time for the cds to sweep up a given mass of csm is also @xmath197 longer .",
    "so , even though the shell masses and energies are comparable in models c and d , the dynamics and radiative properties of the interaction are distinct .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_map_modd ] a set of greyscale images for the velocity , temperature , density , and luminosity versus radius and time for model d. figure  [ fig_lbol_modd ] shows the bolometric light curve of model d computed with .",
    "we also show snapshots of these interaction properties at 10.0 and 100.0d ( fig .",
    "[ fig_modd_her ] ) .    compared to model c , the shock is still present at the end of the simulation at 150d .",
    "but just like in model c , the inner shell material is strongly decelerated .",
    "because of the contrast in inner / outer shell mass , the fast material in the inner shell at late times has a very low density . at 150.0d , the cds mass is about 3  and the residual fast inner shell material contains @xmath90.01 .    because the shock persists for the entire duration of the simulation ,",
    "the shock luminosity is a continuous power source for the light curve .",
    "initially , about half of the outer shell mass is quickly ionised , not directly by lyman photons because they suffer a large optical depth , but indirectly through absorption of lower energy photons . within 20d ,",
    "the photosphere has migrated out to @xmath37 cm in the outer shell and will remain at that location until the cds overtakes that radius at @xmath19150d .",
    "relative to model c , the volume of ionised material is larger and the energy from the shock is released for longer so the temperature in the interaction region is lower ( it peaks at @xmath030000k , rather than @xmath19100000k ) .",
    "because of the slow expansion of the outer shell ( in both model c and d ) , the densities are large enough to make the material optically thick to electron scattering .",
    "the limiting factor is the ionisation . in model d",
    ", the balance between heating by the shock and cooling from radiation and expansion permits the ionisation of a sizeable fraction of the outer shell .",
    "this ionised layer is present during the entire high - brightness phase of model d. so , we expect to see persistent signatures of electron scattering .",
    "furthermore , by 60d after the onset of the interaction , the cds velocity is down to @xmath301000  while its optical depth is about 25 .",
    "so , just like in model c , this configuration should not give rise to broad spectral lines at any time .",
    "the lower optical depths achieved in model d produce a faster rising light curve , a brighter peak , and a shorter high brightness phase than in model c. the correspondence with the observed light curve of sn1994w is now satisfactory ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_mod_c_d_obs ] ) . besides kinetic energy",
    ", the transition radius seems an important tuning parameter controlling the light curve of this type of interactions and it may be in part responsible for the observed diversity of sne iin ( the light curves of sn1994w and sn2011ht differ sizeably , yet they exhibit a very similar spectral evolution ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_spec_modd_94w ] shows the spectral evolution for model d , which is very analogous to that of model c. because of the larger radius for interaction , the temperature of the ionised outer shell and of the cds is lower .",
    "this causes the spectral energy distribution to be redder than for model c early on .",
    "importantly , broad lines are never seen , as typified by h@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_modd_94w_ha ] ) . before light curve maximum , the rate at which radiation escapes the csm is lower than the rate at which it is released at the shock because of optical - depth effects .",
    "consequently , the temperature rises in the optically - thick csm until a maximum around bolometric maximum .",
    "afterwards , as long as the optical depth remains sizeable , the rate at which radiation escapes the csm is greater than the rate at which it is released at the shock and the temperature decreases ( fig .",
    "[ fig_f22 ] ) .",
    "this effect , characteristic of the diffusion process here , is seen in model d ( and also in model x of d15 ) and is also observed in sn1994w @xcite .",
    "indeed , the spectra progress towards higher colour temperatures until maximum and towards lower colour temperatures afterwards ( they increasingly redden with time ) , showing signs of recombination and increasing line blanketing .",
    "all these properties reproduce satisfactorily the observations of sn1994w .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a series of radiation - hydrodynamics and radiative - transfer simulations in order to explore the origin of the spectral diversity of interacting sne .",
    "the study is not exhaustive but it captures the salient features seen in events like sn1998s on the one hand , and sn1994w on the other hand .",
    "the main impetus for this work was the perplexing absence of broad lines at all times in the spectra of sn1994w . in @xcite",
    ", we obtained a very good match to the spectral observations of sn1994w by invoking a hydrogen - rich slow optically - thick shell , in which the bulk of the radiation is emitted .",
    "we also proposed that the electron - scattering wings were formed internally to this thick shell , rather than externally into some csm .",
    "our proposed scenario was not easily adaptable to the results of @xcite , who argued for an interaction between a 7 - 12  @xmath010@xmath1erg inner shell with a 0.4  dense wind csm .",
    "the difficulty with that model is to explain the lack of broad lines at late times . in a recent study on super - luminous sne like 2010jl @xcite",
    ", we found that the emission from the dense shell eventually appears , even with a massive and dense csm , and the associated line profiles are doppler broadened , with a velocity representative of the velocity of the dense shell .",
    "for sn1994w , the chugai et al .",
    "model predicts a dense shell moving at @xmath04000 , which is in tension with the @xmath01000  width of spectral lines observed at late times .    here , we resolve this issue .",
    "revisiting the model of chugai et al .",
    "we find that it is more suitable to explain events like sn1998s . at early times ,",
    "when the csm optical depth is large , the cds and the sn ejecta are all obscured .",
    "some spectral lines appear with a distinct iin morphology , with a narrow core and extended wings , all arising from photons re - processed within the slow unshocked csm .",
    "most lines show a second and more narrow component , associated with the more distant and cool csm .",
    "however , as time progresses and the csm optical depth becomes only a few , a large fraction of the photons emitted by the cds is no longer re - processed by the csm . for a cds velocity of a few 1000 , the doppler effect dominates line broadening . in our model",
    "a ( and by extension the corresponding model of chugai ) , the sn spectrum evolves from a iin morphology to a pure absorption spectrum , where the flux forms within the cds .",
    "the lack of an emission component stems from the very steep density profile at the ( outer ) edge of the cds .",
    "the sn enters a third phase when the cds becomes optically thin .",
    "the sn radiation then comes primarily from the inner slower unshocked ejecta , while the cds located further out contributes primarily through broad emission in h@xmath3 and the ca  triplet at 8500 .",
    "these three phases predicted by our model a are observed in sn1998s ( with slight temporal offsets ) .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the cds is not obscured at late times .",
    "more generally , the cds is likely seen in all interacting sne at late times .",
    "but the implication is that sne like 1994w , which never show broad lines , can not be explained by an interaction involving a massive energetic ejecta ramming into a less massive csm since it would produce a fast moving cds .",
    "as our grid of explosions has shown , configurations involving an inner shell of moderate mass and energy interacting with a massive slow outer shell ( e.g. , models r1 and b1 ) produce a cds with a low velocity , compatible with the observations of sn1994w .",
    "such a configuration can probably arise in many different ways in nature .",
    "here , we invoke the context of nuclear flashes in low - mass massive stars @xcite .",
    "we produce two subsequent explosions in a low - mass rsg star of 12  on the main sequence . the first explosion , which mimics the effect of a nuclear flash , ejects the loosely - bound h - rich envelope , producing a @xmath306  ejecta with a mean mass - weighted velocity of @xmath30400 .",
    "the second explosion corresponds to the terminal gravitational collapse of the star left behind , producing a 0.3  ejecta with a kinetic energy of the order of 7 - 8@xmath410@xmath22erg ejecta with a mean mass - weighted velocity of 4740 .",
    "we perform two simulations ( models c and d ) with an initial radius of interaction at 0.2 and @xmath36 cm .",
    "this mass / energy configuration leads to a very different type of interaction compared to model a , while the differing interaction radius between models c and d introduce more subtle differences . in model c , the low - mass inner shell",
    "is completely decelerated within 10d of the onset of the interaction . about 50% of its kinetic energy",
    "is converted to internal energy , trapped in the interaction region . without this interaction , the first exploded shell would appear as a very faint ( @xmath010@xmath21 ) narrow - line sn ii - p ( such events likely exist and are missed by current surveys ) . with the interaction the internal energy of the outer shell",
    "is boosted , causing its temperature to increase .",
    "a sizeable part of the outer shell material that had recombined is then re - ionised , pushing the photosphere out in both mass and radius . the combination of low velocity , large radii , and partial ionisation above the photosphere lead to a iin spectral morphology at early times .",
    "importantly , as the ejecta cools and recombines , the spectrum reddens , the electron scattering wings weaken , the photosphere recedes , and the line profiles narrow .",
    "all these properties are observed in sn1994w and shown by model c. model c is , however , somewhat discrepant because it underestimates the bolometric luminosity of sn1994w , and then overestimates it at late times : model c remains luminous for 200d after the onset of interaction .",
    "this discrepancy is cured with model d by invoking a larger initial interaction radius .    in model d ,",
    "the length scales are much larger so the deceleration of the inner shell takes longer .",
    "the interaction region has a lower optical depth , producing a light curve that now matches satisfactorily the observations of sn1994w .",
    "although the shock survives throughout the high brightness phase , the cds velocity is never large , and quickly drops to @xmath01000 , as in model c. the spectral evolution of models c and d are therefore comparable , and compatible to that of sn1994w ( because of a lower gas temperature in the csm , the spectral evolution of model d reproduces better the observations of sn1994w than model c , for example with weaker and shorter - lived he  lines , like he6678 ) .",
    "the spectral simulations of @xcite , which were not based on a radiation - hydrodynamical model , correspond to a configuration similar to model d.    while we were finalising this manuscript and preparing for submission , a study of sn2011ht by @xcite came out .",
    "chugai s work has a lot of overlap with the present work but it uses an independent and very different approach .",
    "still , the conclusions by and large agree and give further support to the notion that sne like 1994w or 2011ht result from the interaction of a low mass ejecta with an extended , slow , and massive outer shell .",
    "one distinction is that chugai argues for fragmentation to explain the @xmath0100d high - brigthness phase of sn2011ht while we argue that the duration of the high - brightness phase can be modulated simply by invoking a different interaction radius ( model d versus model c ) .",
    "models that invoke an interaction of two shells can produce large luminosities .",
    "this is because sne generally have a huge kinetic energy reservoir , which exceeds by a factor of about 100 the time - integrated luminosity of a standard sn .",
    "interaction with csm is an efficient process to tap into this energy reservoir .",
    "the norm in an interacting sn is therefore to be super - luminous . in the model of chugai et al . , the csm is much less massive than the inner shell , so the deceleration is weak and the high energy available in the inner shell is hardly tapped .",
    "but the consequence is the formation of a fast moving cds , which we demonstrated is incompatible with the observations of sn1994w .",
    "both sn2011ht and sn2011a @xcite show a similar spectral evolution to sn1994w but are characterised by even lower peak visual magnitudes ( of the order of @xmath1116mag ) .",
    "our models c and d , and possible incarnations of that scenario that retain the principle of a low / moderate - mass energetic inner shell exploding within a massive slow moving outer shell , seem much more suited to explain these events than models in which a massive inner shell rams into a csm of much lower mass .",
    "one plausible circumstance for this type of interaction is a nuclear flash shortly before core collapse in a low mass massive star @xcite .    the designation of sn1994w - like events as sn iin - p @xcite aims to distinguish them from the broader diversity of sne iin .",
    "but the designation is somewhat controversial , in part because light curves tend to be degenerate  distinct models can produce identical light curves .",
    "the nebular flux of sn1994w may be explained by invoking a low amount of ni , but it can also be explained by invoking an interaction with a lower density csm and no ni at all .",
    "the origin of the nebular flux is ambiguous , especially in an object that showed strong signs of interaction early on , and therefore it can not be decisive .",
    "the `` p '' might suggest a connection to sne ii - p , but these result from a point explosion in a rsg star and are thus distinct . in our sn iin simulations ( and in observations ) , the post - maximum brightness can show a range of decline rates , often incompatible with a plateau designation .",
    "interestingly , the light curves of sn1998s and sn1994w are somewhat similar . what is strikingly different between the two types of events is the spectral evolution .",
    "sn1994w - like events differ from all other sne by the presence of narrow lines _ at all times _  sn1998s shows narrow lines at early times but broad lines ( reminiscent of a sn ii - p / ii - l ) at late times .",
    "this feature is missed in the iin classification since many sne iin exhibit narrow lines only for a short time .",
    "so , perhaps a better designation for sn1994w - like events would be as type iinn , to emphasize the persistence of narrow lines at all times .    what distinguishes narrow line sne",
    "ii - p from sne iin like 1994w are their low luminosity : a fresh supply of energy to a low - energy sn ii - p boosts its luminosity but hardly affects its expansion rate .",
    "so sne iin that would form through the scenario of model c should be characterised by a large brightness for their inferred expansion rate , which would go against the correlation between optical brightness and expansion velocity seen in sne ii - p @xcite .",
    "lsq13fn is a sn that exhibits such peculiar properties , including evidence for ejecta / csm interaction at early times @xcite .",
