    "anomalous diffusion problems naturally arise in the setting of complex biological environment .",
    "modeling of diffusion in different complex media could provide further understanding in a variety of experimental conditions . impeded or anomalous diffusion in the brain is already a well established phenomenon @xcite .",
    "sykova and nicholson @xcite list several factors that determine diffusion impediments : i ) an increase in geometric path length ; ii ) transient trapping of molecules in dead - space microdomains ; iii ) an increased interstitial viscous drag on migrating molecules ; iv ) transient binding to membrane - attached or extracellular matrix - attached receptors ; and v ) nonspecific interaction with fixed opposite charges .",
    "all five factors can be thought of as introducing a delay into the passage of a molecule in brain tissue relative to that in a free medium .",

    "<S> implantation of neuroprosthetic electrodes induces a stereotypical state of neuroinflammation , which is thought to be detrimental for the neurons surrounding the electrode . mechanisms of this type of neuroinflammation are still not understood well . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental and theoretical results point out possible role of the diffusion species in this process .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper considers a model of anomalous diffusion occurring in the glial scar around a chronic implant in two simple geometries  a separable rectilinear electrode and a cylindrical electrode , which are solvable exactly . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a hypothetical extended source of diffusing species and study its concentration profile in steady - state conditions . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion transport is assumed to obey a fractional - order fick law , which is derived from physically realistic assumptions using a fractional calculus approach . </S>",
    "<S> the derived fractional - order distribution morphs into regular order diffusion in the case of integer fractional exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the model presented here demonstrates that accumulation of diffusing species can occur and the scar properties ( i.e. tortuosity , fractional order , scar thickness ) can influence such accumulation . </S>",
    "<S> the observed shape of the concentration profile corresponds qualitatively with gfap profiles reported in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference with respect to the previous studies is the explicit incorporation of the apparatus of fractional calculus without assumption of an ad hoc tortuosity parameter . </S>",
    "<S> intended application of the approach is the study of diffusing substances in the glial scar after implantation of neural prostheses , although the approach can be adapted to other studies of diffusion in biological tissues , for example of biomolecules or small drug molecules . </S>"
