    "metric structures arise frequently in probability theory .",
    "prominent examples are random trees ( e.g.@xcite ) , where the distance between two points is given by the length of the shortest path connecting the points . a class of random trees is given by coalescent processes , where a subset of an infinite number of _ lines _ can merge and the distance of two leaves is proportional to the coalescence time ( @xcite ) .",
    "the complexity of this class of processes is properly described by the concepts of @xmath0-coalescent , where any set of lines can merge to a single line ( a multiple collision , @xcite ) and @xmath1-coalescents , where any set of lines can merge to several lines at the same time ( a simultaneous multiple collision , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting metric space has so far mostly been studied in the simplest case , where only binary mergers are allowed , the kingman - coalescent @xcite .",
    "analyzing metric structures requires geometrical and topological foundations . in the context of riemannian geometry",
    ", such foundations have already been laid by gromov , summarized in his book ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "these authors study convergence of ( isometry classes of ) compact metric spaces by the notion of gromov - hausdorff convergence .",
    "in addition , gromov introduced a topology on the space of ( isometry classes of ) metric measure spaces ( mm - spaces , for short ) , which are metric spaces equipped with a measure . we will call this the gromov - weak topology in the sequel ( see also @xcite ) .    in probability theory ,",
    "results on weak convergence and stochastic process theory require that the underlying space is polish .",
    "in addition , a characterization of the compact sets is required in order to show tightness .",
    "these concepts have been worked out based on gromov s notions by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is as follows : we concentrate on the spaces of _ locally compact _ and _ compact _ mm - spaces and give a characterization of these ( see theorems  [ t : compact ] and [ t : loccompact ] ) .",
    "in addition , we apply these general results to random mm - spaces ( @xmath0-coalescent measure trees ) which arise in connection to @xmath0-coalescents . recall that @xmath0-coalescents fall into one of two categories , depending on @xmath0 .",
    "either a @xmath0-coalescent comes down from infinity , meaning that it can be started with an infinite number of lines and only finitely many are left at any positive time , or it stays infinite for all times ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 23 ) ) .",
    "the proof of the following result is given in section  [ s:4 ] .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath0 be a finite measure on @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 the corresponding @xmath0-coalescent .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 is the associated @xmath0-coalescent measure tree , taking values in the space of mm - spaces .",
    "then the following is equivalent .    1 .",
    "@xmath3 comes down from infinity , i.e. @xmath5 almost surely , for all @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   @xmath4 is compact , almost surely .    if ( 1 ) ( or 2 ) does not hold , @xmath4 is not even locally compact .",
    "we proceed as follows : in section  [ s : mm ] we develop our general theory on compact and locally compact isometry classes of metric measure spaces .",
    "section  [ s : lambda ] contains a short introduction to @xmath0-coalescent measure trees .",
    "finally , the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is given in section  [ s:4 ] .",
    "we remark that the application of ( locally ) compact mm - spaces is not restricted to trees .",
    "for example , it is possible to study large random planar maps , as given in @xcite , or random graphs ( e.g.  the erds - renyi random graph , @xcite ) , by our notions .",
    "we start with some notation .",
    "our main results , the characterization of compact and locally compact mm - spaces , is given in theorems  [ t : compact ] and  [ t : loccompact ] .",
    "as usual , given a topological space @xmath7 , we denote by @xmath8 the space of all probability measures on the borel-@xmath9-algebra @xmath10 . the _ support _ of @xmath11 , supp@xmath12 , is the smallest closed set @xmath13 such that @xmath14 . the _",
    "push - forward _ of @xmath15 under a measurable map @xmath16 from @xmath17 into another topological space , @xmath18 , is the probability measure @xmath19 defined for all @xmath20 by @xmath21 we denote weak convergence in @xmath8 by @xmath22 .    1 .",
    "a _ metric measure space _ is a triple @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a complete and separable metric space which is equipped with a probability measure @xmath15 on @xmath26 .",
    "we say that @xmath23 and @xmath27 are _ measure - preserving isometric _ if there exists an isometry @xmath16 between supp@xmath28 and supp@xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that the property of being measure - preserving isometric is an equivalence relation .",
    "the equivalence class of the metric measure space @xmath23 is called the mm - space of @xmath23 and is denoted @xmath31 .",
    "the set of mm - spaces is denoted @xmath32 and generic elements are @xmath33 3 .   an mm - space @xmath34 is _ ( locally ) compact _ if there is @xmath35 such that @xmath25 is ( locally ) compact .",
    "the space of ( locally ) compact mm - spaces is denoted @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .    following @xcite , we equip @xmath38 with the gromov - weak topology as follows .    for",
    "a metric space @xmath25 define @xmath39 the map which sends a sequence of points in @xmath17 to its distance matrix and for an mm - space @xmath40 we define the _ distance matrix distribution _ by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the infinite product measure of @xmath15 , where @xmath43 is equipped with the product @xmath9-field .",
    "we say that a sequence @xmath44 converges _ gromov - weakly _ to @xmath34 if @xmath45    note that @xmath46 does not depend on the representative @xmath35 , hence is well - defined .",
    "recall from theorem  1 of @xcite that the space @xmath47 , equipped with the gromov - weak topology , is polish .",
    "hence , @xmath48 allows to use standard tools from probability , e.g. from the theory of weak convergence .    in order to show that a random variable taking values in @xmath48 is supported by the space of locally compact or compact mm - spaces , there are two strategies , formulated here in the case of compact mm - spaces :    either , consider the gromov - weak topology on @xmath36",
    ". defining an approximating sequence in @xmath36 and showing that the sequence is tight in @xmath36 ensures compactness of the limiting object .",
    "note that any mm - space can be approximated by finite ( hence compact ) mm - spaces , so @xmath36 is not closed in @xmath48 .",
    "so , this approach amounts to knowing the compact sets in @xmath36 .",
    "see proposition  6.2 of @xcite for an example .",
    "our application to the @xmath0-coalescent measure tree in section  [ s:4 ] relies on a different approach .",
    "it is possible to give handy characterizations of compact mm - spaces ; see theorem  [ t : compact ] .",

    "we assume that supp@xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath64 , we have that @xmath65 moreover , @xmath66 by construction , where @xmath67 is the closed ball of radius @xmath68 around @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that @xmath70 in particular , @xmath71 means , that thin points ( in the sense that @xmath72 ) are rare ( i.e.  carry mass at most @xmath68 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath73 this means that there are @xmath15-almost surely no points which are too thin ( in the sense that @xmath72 ) .",

    "all results follow , since @xmath85 and since @xmath46 is exchangeable .",
    "recall from theorem  2 in @xcite that for any @xmath34 , it holds that @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , a set @xmath87 is pre - compact iff @xmath88 is tight ( as a family in @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 .",
    "this leads to a characterization of tightness for a family of random mm - spaces , see @xcite , theorem 3 : here , ( the distributions of ) a family @xmath91 of @xmath48-valued random variables is tight iff @xmath92 is tight ( where @xmath93 is the first moment measure of @xmath94 and @xmath95 \\xrightarrow{\\delta\\to 0 } 0.$ ] given a sequence of random mm - spaces , we can use these results in order to obtain limiting objects , at least along subsequences .",
    "now we come to a characterization of compact mm - spaces .",

    "we come to the application of the general results from the last section to metric spaces which arise in the context of coalescents which allow for multiple mergers .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is given in the next section",
    ". introduced by @xcite , @xmath0-coalescents are usually described by markov processes taking values in partitions of @xmath161 , which become coarser as time evolves , almost surely , and are exchangeable .",
    "more exactly , we define @xmath162 , starting in the trivial partition of @xmath161 . for a finite measure @xmath0 on @xmath2 $ ] ,",
    "set @xmath163 among any set of @xmath164 partition elements in @xmath165 , each subset of size @xmath166 merges to one partition element at rate @xmath167 .",
    "it is easy to check that such a process is well - defined ( i.e.  the @xmath167 s are consistent ) and leads to an exchangeable partition of @xmath161 for all @xmath168 . in our analysis we restrict ourselves to measures @xmath0 which do not have an atom at 1 ; see example  20 in @xcite for a discussion of this case .",
    "one intuitive way to construct a @xmath0-coalescent ( given @xmath0 has no atom at 0 ) is as follows : consider a poisson - process with intensity measure @xmath169 on @xmath2 \\times \\mathbb r_+$ ] . at any poisson point @xmath170 ,",

    "precisely , it was stated that a @xmath0-coalescent comes down from infinity iff @xmath176 it has been shown by @xcite that this is equivalent to @xmath177 for some @xmath6 where @xmath178 the larger class of coalescents having the dust - free property is characterized by the requirement that @xmath179 see theorem 8 in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath180 be the @xmath0-coalescent .",
    "then for almost all sample paths of @xmath181 , there is a metric @xmath182 on @xmath183 , associated to @xmath184 , defined by @xmath185 that is the time needed for @xmath186 and @xmath174 to coalesce .",

    "since coalescent processes are associated with tree - like structures , we call the limiting mm - space @xmath191 the _ @xmath0-coalescent measure tree_.",
    "let @xmath192 denote the number of blocks in the partition @xmath165 and note that @xmath193 where @xmath194 is only possible if there are partition elements in @xmath195 which carry no mass in @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath117 : using corollary  [ cor : cp ] , we must show that for all @xmath55 , we have @xmath196 almost surely .",

    "since there are infinitely many lines up to time @xmath68 , we find partition elements of arbitrarily small mass .",
    "this implies that @xmath202 almost surely , for all @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath4 is compact , there is a random variable @xmath104 such that @xmath203 , almost surely by corollary  [ cor : compact ] . in particular , there is @xmath60 such that @xmath204 with positive probability , which gives a contradiction .",
    "last , assume that @xmath4 does not come down from infinity and recall that @xmath0 can not have an atom at @xmath205 in this case .",
    "it has been shown in proposition  23 of @xcite that the total coalescence rate of all lines is infinite for all times , almost surely .",
    "this is easy to see from the construction of @xmath0-coalescence using the poisson process with intensity @xmath206 , since the total coalescence rate of the partition element containing 1 , given that there are infinitely many lines , is @xmath207 since the dust - free property , , holds by assumption .",
