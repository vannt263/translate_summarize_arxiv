    "trojans are planetesimals orbiting a central massive body near the stable lagrange equilibrium points ( l4 & l5 ) of another massive body , which may be a planet if the central object is a star , or a moon if the central object is a planet . here",
    "we focus on trojans with a planet in orbit around a star .",
    "trojans have orbital period similar to that of their host planet and so are said to be corotating with the planet or in 1:1 resonance with the planet .",
    "trojan asteroids have been discovered corotating with jupiter @xcite , earth @xcite , mars @xcite , uranus @xcite and neptune @xcite . as of dec .",
    "2015 , 6,261 jupiter trojans have been identified , and this is the largest group of trojans in the solar system .",
    "there are also several trojan moons corotating with saturn .",
    "12 neptune trojans ( nts ) have been found in all , including 9 moving around the l4 lagrange point and 3 around l5 .",
    "their orbital parameters are listed in table [ data ] .",
    "the orbital inclinations of 5 nts are higher than @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite corrected for the observatory regional bias for the three nts that they discovered to estimate the ratio of high- to low - inclination orbits of the l4 trojans , finding a ratio of nearly 4:1 .",
    "recently , @xcite improved upon correcting for the detection bias as a function of inclination , eccentricity , and libration amplitude distributions and estimated a standard deviation for the nt inclinations of @xmath1 at greater than @xmath2 confidence level .",
    "[ data ]    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     yr of the @xmath3  yr integration .",
    "[ distri4],width=302 ]    we show in fig . [ distri4 ] the cumulative distributions of final eccentricities and inclinations of trapped nts for the different initial @xmath4 distributions .",
    "orbits all concentrate on the high eccentricity ( inclination ) part , as the situation shown in the uniform distribution ( fig .",
    "[ distri21 ] ) .",
    "nts with high eccentricities and high inclinations are unstable dynamically under the current configuration of the solar system @xcite , consequently observed nts with high inclinations have moderately low eccentricity ( @xmath6  for  @xmath7 ) . to compare our integrated eccentricity and inclination distributions with the observed distribution , we plot eccentricity versus inclination for all remaining and captured nts in the with - damping cases ( fig .",
    "[ ei ] ) . on this plot ,",
    "stable regions computed by @xcite are shown as rectangular gray areas . though the number of captured high - inclination objects is larger than the number of captured low - inclination objects , most of the captured nts are actually located in dynamically unstable regions , lying outside these gray areas .    the @xmath4 distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ ei ] also has indications of secular resonance with neptune .",
    "the color bar on the righthand side of fig .",
    "[ ei ] shows the semi - major axis of planetesimals at the time when they were captured into the 1:1 resonance with neptune .",
    "the blue end of the color bar shows planetesimals that were trapped from the outer part of the trans - neptunian disk .",
    "these experienced a long period of time when they were excited by secular resonances with neptune before they were captured .",
    "thus , most of them have high eccentricities and inclinations and are located on the top and righthand region of fig . [ ei ] .    , width=302 ]",
    "we have investigated how the orbital element distributions of nts are affected by planetary migration , specifically on how orbital dissipation of uranus and neptune while they migrated affects the distributions .",
    "we find that orbital dissipation or damping of eccentricity and inclination of uranus and neptune during migration plays a crucial role in affecting the orbital distributions of nts , for both primordial and captured nts populations . for primordial nts",
    ", the orbital dissipation causes instability , reducing the surviving fraction , from 0.54 to 0.06 .",
    "the proportions of the remaining nts with high inclinations ( @xmath8 ) ( compared to low inclinations ) also decreases ( fig .",
    "[ distri11 ] ) . for trapped nts ,",
    "secular resonances with neptune are important due to the initial higher eccentricity and inclination of neptune during migration .",
    "these resonances excite inclinations and eccentricities in the trans - neptune disk objects before they are captured into 1:1 resonance with neptune .",
    "firstly , in a dynamically cold initial trans - neptune disks objects initially at low inclination are excited by secular resonances and then dominate the population of high inclination captured nts after migration .",
    "the trapping efficiency is enhanced by @xmath9 for an initial normal @xmath4 distributions , @xmath10 in the hot rayleigh initial distribution ( @xmath11  radian ) , and @xmath12 in the cold rayleigh distribution condition ( @xmath13  radian ) , respectively where we are comparing simulations with - damping to those without . secondly , the capture efficiency from the cold trans - neptunian disk ( cold rayleigh distribution case , 263/100,000 ) exceeds that of the stirred - up disk ( hot rayleigh distribution case , 174/100,000 ) after considering the orbital dissipation of ice giants ( i.e. , with - damping cases ) .",
    "thus , the orbital dissipation of uranus and neptune due to dynamical friction of planetesimal disks must be considered in future studies of the origins of the nt population .",
    "the captured nts population contains a larger number of objects at high eccentricity and high inclination than in our simulated primordial nt population , both in the with - damping case and in the no - damping case ( fig .",
    "[ distri21 ] ) .",
    "though the capture efficiency for the nts trapped from the primordial trans - neptune disk is much lower than the proportion of surviving primordial nts , it is still possible that the ratio of high - inclination to low - inclination orbit of nts approaches the observed value 4:1 , because the trans - neptune disk originally had many more planetesimals than were originally present as part of a primordial nt population .",
    "we have compared the numbers and orbital element distributions of nts around the two lagrange points , l4 and l5 , with neptune .",
    "the orbital distributions of the nts around l4 and l5 are similar for both the primordial and trapped nt populations .",
    "the capture efficiencies are also similar .",
    "there is a transient asymmetry at the end of the planetary migration for the primoridal nts in the with - damping case ( table  3 ) .",
    "our estimated number of stable trapped nts is too small to make meaningful statistical conclusions .",
    "since the final planetary architecture in our simulations is not entirely consistent with the current architecture of the solar system , we do not continue the calculations after @xmath3  yr . there are currently planetesimals passing through l4 and l5 regions with neptune and collisions continue to change the number of trapped nts .",
    "the number of nts present at the end of our simulations at @xmath3 years should be different from present today .",
    "furthermore , most of our simulated trapped nts with high inclinations also have high eccentricities ( see also @xcite ) , and these are unstable if integrated to a longer time . how trapped high - eccentricities and high - inclinations nts remain stable on long time scales remains a problem for future study .",

    "<S> we also study trans - neptunian objects captured into resonance with neptune and becoming nts during planet migration . we find that most primordial nts were unstable and lost if eccentricity and inclination damping took place during planetary migration . with damping , secular resonances with neptune can increase a low eccentricity and inclination population of trans - neptunian objects increasing the probability that they are captured into 1:1 resonance with neptune , becoming high inclination nts . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the resonant trapping scenario is a promising and more effective mechanism explaining the origin of nts that is particularly effective if uranus and neptune experienced eccentricity and inclination damping during planetary migration .    </S>",
