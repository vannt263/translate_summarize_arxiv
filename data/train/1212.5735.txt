    "the red rectangle ( rr ) is an x - shaped , biconical , protoplanetary nebula associated with the star hd  44179 .",
    "its moniker is derived from its rectangular appearance in red photographic plates @xcite , while its appearance in the blue plates is approximately circular .",
    "the appearance of the rr in the red is dominated by its high intensity of extended red emission ( ere ) @xcite , powered by the central source ( hd 44179 ) , which is a single line spectroscopic binary @xcite .",
    "the binary consists of a post - agb primary star ( 0.8  m@xmath1 ) with an effective temperature of roughly 8000  k , and a near solar mass main - sequence companion that has an accretion disk and jet ( see witt et al . 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "the x - shaped structure corresponds to the walls of a biconical low - density cavity within the spherical agb outflow .",
    "the walls of the cavity appear bright where the line of sight is tangential to the cone .",
    "the walls of the cavity are directly illuminated by the central source , which gives rise to the strong ere @xcite .",
    "the far uv photons ( energies @xmath2  ev ) necessary to excite the ere @xcite are produced in the hot accretion disk ( t  @xmath3  17,000  k ) of the secondary star @xcite .",
    "the rr s seemingly unique appearance can be attributed to its orientation on the sky with respect to our view from earth .",
    "the central binary is obscured by a near - edge - on optically - thick circumbinary disk with an inclination angle of 86 as measured by @xcite or 85 as measured by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the central source can only be observed via scattering over the top and bottom of the circumbinary disk .",
    "this indirect line of sight causes us to view the binary at an effective inclination angle of 35 @xcite .",
    "the effective inclination is an average angle , as the orbital motion produces a variation of @xmath4  0.8 . since the inferred properties of the system are dependent upon knowing the correct angle for our line of sight to the primary star , all such derived properties are somewhat uncertain .",
    "significant research has been conducted on the morphology of the extended nebula . the most likely agent for producing",
    "the morphology is a high speed bipolar jet launched from the accretion disk around the secondary star .",
    "the bipolar jet proceeds to carve a low density cavity in the more slowly expanding spherical cloud of material ejected during the primary star s agb stage .",
    "this scenario for shaping such bipolar nebulae was proposed by @xcite .",
    "such a high speed jet has been observed in the rr via h@xmath5 absorption @xcite .",
    "studies of the h@xmath5 spectra reveal that the velocity of the jet material ranges between a minimum of 150  km  s@xmath6 @xcite and a maximum of 560  km  s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite have used the binary model to explain other features of the morphology of the rr .",
    "@xcite posit a narrow precessing jet that originates from the secondary star with the goal of producing the ladder - like rungs that appear in the outer nebula .",
    "conversely , @xcite employed a wide angle jet to evacuate the biconical cavity . using a scattered light model ( with the biconical cavity devoid of dust )",
    "they show that the ladder rungs could be ring - like structures that are observed in other bipolar nebulae , which in the case of the rr , when projected onto the plane of the sky , appear as ladder rungs .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that special physics is not required to shape the rr , and suggests intermittent jets give rise to the ladder like structures in the rr .",
    "the goal of this paper is explore the geometry and kinematics of the jet using an analysis of the h@xmath5 spectra as a function of orbital phase .",
    "is the jet narrow or wide ?",
    "specifically , we demonstrate that the opening angle of the jet is roughly equal to the geometric opening angle of the x - shaped structure of the rr . therefore , our data are more consistent with the model of @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we first introduce the framework in which the data will be discussed .",
    "the orbit and the physical model for the jet are described in   [ paper2:sec : model ] .",

    "we present our conclusions in   [ paper2:sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a 3d geometric model of the rr system is necessary for interpreting our measurements ( to be discussed in   [ paper2:sec : measurement ] ) .",
    "the principal components of this system are : the primary star , the secondary star and its accretion disk , the bipolar jet , the circumbinary disk , and the spherical outflow .",
    "we approximate the jet as a bi - cone centred on the secondary star , and include the orbital solution of @xcite for calculating the positions of the various objects as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the inclination angle , @xmath7 , of the rr is 85 .",
    "the distance to the rr remains uncertain , but we adopt the value of 710  pc derived by @xcite for our calculations .",
    "the outer radius of the circumbinary disc is 1850  au @xcite , while the radius of the central cavity in the circumbinary disk is estimated to be 14  au @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the circumbinary disk is determined to be approximately 100  au @xcite .",
    "the opening angle ( angle from cavity wall to cavity wall ) of the biconical cavity is 40 just above the circumbinary disk , while at larger distances it expands from 62 to 80 @xcite . for modeling purposes we use 70 ( corresponding to a 35 half opening angle ) , as was used in the work of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the innermost region of our model for the rr . the outer radius of the accretion disk ( @xmath30.3  au ) is set to be the distance of the l1 lagrange point from the secondary star when the binary components are at periastron .",
    "the size of the primary star ( radius @xmath3 0.21  au ) and the orbital separation of the binary components are shown to - scale .",
    "notice that the direct line of sight ( direction to the observer ) is blocked by the optically thick circumbinary disk .",
    "consequently , the primary star is viewed indirectly ( at an effective inclination angle , @xmath8 35 ) via scattering over the top and bottom of the circumbinary disk . as a result",
    ", the indirect line of sight passes through the material in the jet above and below the accretion disk when the secondary passes in front of the primary at superior conjunction",

    "the size of the primary star and the separation between the primary and secondary are shown to - scale with 1  au as indicated .",
    "the accretion disk is shown around the secondary , with the jet emanating from above and below the hot accretion disk .",
    "the fiducial mark between the stars corresponds to the centre of mass ( com ) . ]    as discussed in @xcite , emission features can originate anywhere in the rr , whereas absorption features must arise from material in the line of sight to the primary star .",
    "therefore , when studying absorption features one must use @xmath8 35 . furthermore , the absorbing material most likely lies between the star and the inner edge of the circumbinary disk .",
    "our focus for this study will be on the periodically variable blue - shifted h@xmath5 absorption feature attributed to the jet @xcite .",
    "the orbit of the binary has been studied previously by @xcite and @xcite , the orbital period was found to be @xmath3  317  days .",
    "the system is receding from earth at roughly 19  km  s@xmath6 . in all of our data",
    "the observations are phase folded using the orbital period of 317  days with a zero phase point @xmath11  jd 2448300 , which was chosen to correspond roughly to minimum in the radial velocity curve @xcite . in this paper",
    "all orbital phases indicate the location of the primary .",
    "the location of the secondary is always opposite relative to the centre of mass . to aid in the interpretation of the data and model calculations , figure [ fig2 ]",
    "shows the orbits of both stars .",
    "we will frequently refer to the following key orbital locations : inferior conjunction ( ic ) when the primary is between the observer and the secondary , which occurs at phase @xmath10  =  0.21 ; superior conjunction ( sc ) when the secondary is between the observer and the primary ( @xmath10  =  0.59 ) ; apastron ( @xmath10  =  0.79 ) ; and periastron ( @xmath10  =  0.29 ) .",
    "=  0.21 , occurs where the direction vector to earth ( 5 below the plane of the page ) intersects the primary s orbit on the earth side of the com .",
    "the phase of superior conjunction ( sc ) , phase @xmath10  =  0.59 , occurs where the earth vector intersects the primary s orbit on the far side of the com . ]",
    "the high velocity biconical jet is observed via absorption in the h@xmath5 line profiles . since the original study of the jet by @xcite 16 new spectra have been obtained in order to study the geometry of the jet , with emphasis on the orbital phases during which the material in the jet lies in the line of sight to the primary star .",
    "the data set now contains a total of 33 observations , the locations of which are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the spectra were acquired at the apache point observatory ( apo ) with the arces echelle spectrograph @xcite and the 3.5-m telescope .",
    "the spectrograph has a resolving power of r  =  38,000 , producing a velocity resolution of 8  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra in the h@xmath5 region is roughly 1000 .",
    "each observation is the average of two spectra acquired consecutively on the same night .",
    "the dates of observation were chosen for the purpose of studying the periodic variability of the rr .",
    "the data reduction has remained unchanged since @xcite and @xcite , and the complete data set is described fully in @xcite .    the h@xmath5 line profiles , shown in figure [ fig3 ] , have several distinct features .",
    "first , there is a narrow , symmetric , stationary emission peak that has a fwhm @xmath320  km  s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "second , there is a ( lower amplitude ) broad emission plateau ( fwhm of nearly 200  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "third , there is an asymmetric blue - shifted absorption feature on the blue side of the emission plateau that appears shortly after the phase of ic and becomes strongest around the time of sc , see panel b of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "there are also broad emission wings that extend to @xmath4  600  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the narrow emission feature has been ascribed to material in the central hii region @xcite .",
    "the likely source of ionising photons is the uv produced in the inner regions of the secondary s accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the width of the narrow emission feature is similar to the orbital velocities for the innermost circumbinary material , which suggests that this material is in circumbinary orbit .",
    "the broad emission plateau and extended emission wings are likely due to either the material in the jet , and/or material in the accretion disk . since emission",
    "can originate from anywhere in the system it is harder to pinpoint its origin .",
    "the absorption feature has been attributed to absorption by material in the jet @xcite .",
    "it is this absorption feature we shall focus on .          analysing the h@xmath5 profiles in detail to study",
    "the jet requires that the observed spectral profiles have the contribution of the primary s photosphere removed .",
    "the nlte stellar atmosphere code , phoenix , version 15.04.00e @xcite , was used to calculate the expected h@xmath5 absorption line profile of the primary star .",
    "other model lines produced by phoenix are much narrower than the observed lines @xcite ; this feature likely applies to the h@xmath5 line as well .",
    "therefore , the subtraction of the phoenix model line from the observed line profiles was carried out using the subtraction technique discussed in @xcite .",
    "this technique removes the underlying photospheric absorption line by accounting for the intrinsic broadening that seems to be present in all unblended atomic absorption lines in the spectra of the rr @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite attributes similar broadening to light scattering off moving grains .",
    "the model line profile is broadened by a broadening kernel derived from the observed characteristic photospheric absorption profiles .",
    "examples of the subtracted spectra are shown in figure [ fig3 ] ; these same spectra are presented in their unsubtracted form in figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "in order to study the jet geometry , the equivalent width of the blue wing of the broad emission plateau of the h@xmath5 profile , @xmath12(h@xmath5 )  =  @xmath13 , was measured as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the orbital phase dependence of these measurements helps to constrain @xmath5 , the half opening angle of the jet .",
    "the emission equivalent width was measured for each photosphere - subtracted spectrum , from @xmath1427  km  s@xmath6 to @xmath14600  km  s@xmath6 , so as to not include the effects of the central narrow h@xmath5 emission feature .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "emission equivalent widths are typically defined to be negative , in figure [ fig4 ] we see that the maximum h@xmath5 equivalent width measured is roughly @xmath15   . as a function of phase",
    "we see that the amount of emission decreases just after ic , reaching a minimum near sc after which it increases again as the primary star again approaches ic .",
    "the observed decrease corresponds to more absorbing material in the indirect line of sight , thus lowering the amount of emission observed . since the equivalent width measurements remain negative , the amount of absorption never exceeds the amount of emission .",
    "the scatter in the data is due to uncertainties in the continuum level and residual telluric features .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured by hand and with a script , each data point is the average of these two values and the error bars represent one standard deviation .",
    "another way to visualise the characteristic absorption feature of the jet is to construct a difference spectrum by subtracting the spectrum that shows no sign of the absorbing material .",
    "the photosphere - subtracted spectrum which occurs at ic , phase @xmath10  =  0.21 , was taken to be the template spectrum due to its symmetric observed profile ( see panel a of figure [ fig3 ] ) , and because this is the phase during which the emission equivalent width is least affected by the presence of the jet ( i.e. , the equivalent width is most negative ) , see figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the template spectrum was subtracted from every photosphere - subtracted spectrum ; the results are presented as a dynamical spectrum for all 33 observations in figure [ fig5 ] . the systematic variation in the strength of the absorption as a function of orbital phase naturally agrees with the equivalent width measurements .",
    "the majority of the absorption occurs within roughly @xmath14200  km  s@xmath6 , while the underlying emission extends to approximately @xmath14600  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the velocity at which the absorption maximum occurs , @xmath16 , is relatively constant , roughly @xmath1435  km  s@xmath6 , while the velocity of the blue edge of the absorption feature , @xmath17 , is variable and has a maximum value of roughly @xmath14200  km  s@xmath6 .     profile .",
    "larger negative values indicate stronger emission , and correspondingly less absorption by the jet .",
    "the error bars are one standard deviation for the average of two measurement techniques .",
    "the vertical lines correspond to the phases of ic and sc , see figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the absorption maximum of the jet occurs near sc , while the minimum of the absorption occurs near ic . ]",
    "absorption feature .",
    "each spectrum shown is the difference ( observed  @xmath14  template ) .",
    "the continuum corresponds to 0.00 on the linear grey - scale bar , absorption corresponds to negative numbers .",
    "the vertical lines correspond to the fwhm of the narrow emission peak , any subtraction here is inaccurate due to variations in the intensity of the narrow emission peak . ]",
    "in this section our goal is to determine the jet half opening angle , @xmath5 ( the angle between the conical jet axis and the wall of the conical jet , see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "to do so we will employ two observational diagnostics that depend on the jet geometry .",
    "the first is the absorption equivalent width , which measures the amount of absorbing material in the jet .",
    "the second is the dynamical absorption spectrum , which measures the velocities in the jet .      from the observed phase coverage ( @xmath10  =  0.4 to @xmath10  =  0.9 ) , where the primary star is occulted to varying degrees by the jet ( figure [ fig4 ] and figure [ fig5 ] ) , we can say that @xmath5 must be large enough that the jet attenuates light from the primary star for most of the orbit .",
    "this implies that @xmath5 is near but does not exceed the effective inclination of the line of sight to the primary star .",
    "if @xmath5 were larger than @xmath9 there would always be some occultation of the primary star .",
    "it is useful to look at the variation in the equivalent width of the absorption feature , instead of the emission feature .",
    "we used the change in equivalent width with respect to the symmetric spectrum at ic .",
    "the change in equivalent width produced by the absorption feature was calculated by subtracting the equivalent width at ic from each equivalent width measurement ( w@xmath18w@xmath19 ) .",
    "the results were normalised for comparison to the normalised model curves ( to be discussed below ) and are shown in figure [ fig6.eps ] . in the figure we see that as a function of phase the line of sight starts to pass through the jet just after ic .",
    "the line of sight reaches absorption maximum near sc , and trails off toward zero absorption as the primary star again approaches ic .",
    "the path length through the jet was used to approximate the equivalent width , @xmath12 , which on the linear portion of the curve of growth is proportional to the column density , @xmath20 . at constant density",
    ", @xmath20 is proportional to the geometric path length , @xmath21 , through the jet .",
    "this simplistic model allows us to calculate the orbital phase dependence of the normalised path length through the jet at various values of @xmath5 , for comparison to the equivalent width measurements .",
    "model calculations for three values of @xmath5 ( 33 , 35 , and 37 ) are over - plotted on the normalised equivalent width measurements in figure [ fig6.eps ] .",
    "the selected curves are calculated for an indirect line of sight angle of @xmath22 , the `` effective '' inclination angle .",
    "the model curves fit surprisingly well for such a simple model .",
    "the results indicate that the best fitting model is such that @xmath23  35  =  @xmath9 .",
    "since the value of @xmath9 is uncertain , the path length curves were calculated for effective inclination angles of 30 , 40 , and 50 . in all cases ,",
    "the results were such that the value of @xmath5 required to match the measurements was , respectively ; 30 , 40 , and 50 .",
    "therefore , we can state that @xmath5 must approximately equal the effective inclination angle for the system , regardless of the assumed effective inclination .",
    "profile , shown in arbitrary units .",
    "the curves correspond to the normalised geometric path length through the jet for different values of @xmath5 , also in arbitrary units .",
    "the dashed , solid , and dash - dot curves correspond to @xmath5 = 33 , 35 , and 37 respectively .",
    "the horizontal axis corresponds to the orbital phase .",
    "the vertical lines correspond to ic and sc , see figure [ fig2 ] . ]",
    "@xcite noted that the equivalent width measurements are asymmetric about the phase of sc .",
    "this asymmetry was interpreted as a sign of material trailing the jet .",
    "however , we find that trailing material is not required to explain the observed asymmetry in the orbital phase dependence of the absorption feature .",
    "the curves are asymmetric due to the eccentricity of the orbit ( @xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit causes the indirect lines of sight to the primary star to pass through different heights above the orbital plane as a function of phase . using our 3d model we calculate the height above the orbital plane for lines of sight to the upper and lower limbs of the star , as well as the centre of the primary star ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the large size of the primary star spreads out the curves for lines of sight to the leading and trailing limbs of the star as well ; however , the change in phase coverage is minor ( about @xmath25 in phase ) , the curves are otherwise similar .",
    "the resulting path lengths ( @xmath26  exit point ( 45  au ) @xmath14 entry point ) are also asymmetric about sc .",
    "therefore , we need not invoke trailing material to explain the observations . any such trailing material would be of significantly lower density than the jet , and would have a significantly smaller effect on the observed spectra . if present",
    ", this material may simply contribute to a more or less uniform background present in all spectra , and would be effectively removed in the subtraction of the template spectrum .    .",
    "]      here we use the dynamical absorption spectrum ( figure [ fig5 ] ) to determine the jet kinematics by fitting the observed velocities .",
    "we will focus on the observed velocity of the blue edge of the absorption feature , @xmath17 , and the observed velocity of the absorption maximum @xmath16 .",
    "we will use the majuscule , @xmath27 , to refer to velocities in the data , and the minuscule , @xmath28 , to denote computed velocity values . for our calculations",
    "below , we used @xmath5  =  @xmath9  =  35 .",
    "we modelled a constant velocity jet , an accelerating jet , and a jet with a latitudinal velocity structure .",
    "the constant velocity model has a velocity of 200  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the accelerating jet had only a radial dependence to the velocity of the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the velocity along the jet axis ( set to 200  km  s@xmath6 ) , @xmath31 is the radial distance from the centre of mass of the secondary star , and @xmath32 is the normalisation radius in this case we used 1  au .",
    "in all the models we assume the outflow is purely in the radial direction , centred on the secondary star .",
    "the best fitting model was the latitudinal velocity structure , which has a velocity gradient ( with the higher velocities along the jet axis ) in the latitudinal ( polar ) direction only .",
    "typically , acceleration of the outflowing jet normally happens within 1  au for solar type stars @xcite , after which the motion is ballistic .",
    "since our line of sight never probes lower than roughly 1  au , see figure [ fig7 ] , we will ignore such acceleration in this model . typically , the terminal speed along a given streamline scales with the escape speed at the base of the streamline where the material is launched . for this reason hydrodynamic models predict velocity distributions with the highest velocity material along the cone axis ( sometimes referred to as a spine or jet ) and the slower material at the edges (",
    "sometimes called the sheath or conical wind ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "let us look at why it might be the case .",
    "continuum photons from the primary star can only be absorbed via a transition line ( e.g. , h@xmath5 ) if the frequency of the photon lies within the range of frequencies spanned by the line profile .",
    "however , in the jet the material is moving .",
    "therefore , the transition line in the jet must be doppler shifted to the velocity of the absorbing particle .",
    "the continuum photon from the star can only be absorbed if its frequency lies within the line width ( @xmath46 ) frequencies of the doppler shifted transition line .",
    "the geometric length , @xmath47 , through the jet in which the continuum photon may be absorbed depends on the width of the line and the velocity gradient @xmath48 of the moving absorbers . in the limit that the line is very narrow ,",
    "the geometric path length ( sobolev length ) depends only on the velocity gradient .",
    "a large gradient in the velocity of the absorbing material in the jet will lead to a narrow interaction region , while a smaller velocity gradient gives rise to a longer interaction region .",
    "the longer the interaction region the stronger the absorption .",
    "therefore , we expect that the absorption will be strongest near the walls of the jet , due to the relatively small velocity gradient ( d@xmath49/d@xmath34 ) and correspondingly longer interaction length .",
    "we expect that the material near the jet axis will have smaller absorption due to the larger velocity gradient , while the material near the entry point will have intermediate absorption values .",
    "we now have a physical explanation of why @xmath16  =  @xmath42 , and @xmath17  =  @xmath41 .    in @xcite",
    "it was noted that the velocity of the outflow was variable based on the observed variation of @xmath17 , see figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "this variability was interpreted as a jet that varies in launch speed or size as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the range in the variation of the velocity would imply that the disk is substantially changing size , since the velocity of the launched material depends on the distance from the centre of the secondary star .",
    "such a dramatic change in the radius of accretion disk is in contradiction to the fall - in time as calculated in @xcite of roughly 500 years .",
    "the fact that the accretion disk is stable for longer periods of times than the orbital period implies that the jet is likely stable as well .",
    "variable accretion rates could possibly affect material launched from the edges of the disk ; however , this material should be launched with slower velocities and can not explain the observed variation in @xmath17 . in contrast , as shown by our calculations , a conical jet with a latitudinally - dependent velocity structure and fixed half opening angle angle , @xmath5 , fits the observations remarkably well , and our model does not require a complex interpretation involving a jet that changes size or launch speed with orbital phase .",
    "finally , we note that neither a constant velocity jet ( @xmath37 ) nor a radially accelerating jet ( without angular variation ) can reproduce the phase dependence of the velocities of the blue edge , @xmath17 , and the absorption maximum , @xmath16 .",
    "in this study we analysed the blue shifted absorption feature previously attributed to the bipolar jet emanating from a hot accretion disk around the secondary star @xcite .",
    "this jet system shares many similarities with jet observed in bd@xmath5046442 @xcite .",
    "both systems are evolved binaries with circumbinary discs , and both systems have wide jets , which are launched from the secondary stars .",
    "however , the viewing geometry of the two objects differ .    based on the observed range in orbital phase during which the primary star is occulted",
    ", we find the half opening angle of the jet , @xmath5 , to be slightly less than the effective inclination angle ( 35 ) .",
    "it can not be greater than this angle , as the spectrum is virtually unaffected near the phase of inferior conjunction ( ic ) .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the assumed inclination angle .",
    "@xcite showed that they needed an effective inclination of 35 in order to fit the observed periodic variation in the visual magnitude ; however , they used the geometry of the x - shaped bi - cone to infer this effective inclination angle .",
    "that said , since our jet half opening angle is essentially the same as the viewing angle it seems very likely that the observed jet is actively carving out the biconical cavity in the otherwise spherical outflow from the agb stage of the primary star s life .",
    "furthermore , in order to fit the equivalent width measurements , a wide jet is required .",
    "therefore , our observations are inconsistent with a narrow precessing jet model , as recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the blue edge of the absorption , @xmath17 , is seen to vary .",
    "we conclude that this variability is likely the result of our indirect line of sight passing through a jet with a latitudinal velocity structure , and not to a jet that is variable with orbital phase .",
    "the jet is stable over the duration of the binary orbit , and does not show variation of outflow velocity or direction . over the 8 year span of observations",
    "no precession in the jet is apparent .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity in the jet is @xmath44  km  s@xmath6 on the jet axis , and @xmath17 is physically related to this velocity .",
    "the velocity of the absorption maximum , @xmath16 , in the jet occurs at approximately @xmath1435  km  s@xmath6 , which is physically related to the velocity at the walls of the jet , which we find to be @xmath45  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge the efforts of apo observers who helped acquire the data .",
    "we would also like to thank hans van winckel for his constructive referee report ."
