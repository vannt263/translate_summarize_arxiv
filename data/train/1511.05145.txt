    "a fundamental probe in modern astronomy to understand the universe , its history and evolution , is the measurement of distances .",
    "stellar parallax and the spectroscopic parallax allow us to reach @xmath3 100 - 1000 pc , respectively but farther afield other methods are needed . a traditional technique for measuring distances",
    "consists in applying the inverse square law for astrophysical sources with known absolute magnitudes , aka , as standard candles .",
    "one of the first such objects used in astronomy were cepheid stars .",
    "a cepheid star s period is directly related to its intrinsic luminosity @xcite and allows one to probe the universe to 15 mpc . to attain larger distances brighter objects are required .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) , have an absolute @xmath4-band magnitude about -19.5  -19.2 mag ( depending on the assumptions of h@xmath5 @xcite ) which can be precisely calibrated using photometric and/or spectroscopic information from the sn itself , and be used as excellent distance indicators .",
    "indeed , there are two parameters correlated to the luminosity .",
    "the first one is the decline rate : sne  ia with fast decline rates are fainter and have narrower light - curve peaks @xcite and the second one , the colour @xcite : redder sne  ia are fainter .",
    "the standardisation of sne  ia to a level @xmath3 0.150.2 mag @xcite , led to the measurement of the expansion history of the universe and showed that , contrary to expectations , the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite . within this new paradigm , one of the greatest challenges",
    "is the search for the mechanism that causes the acceleration , an endeavour that will require exquisitely precise measurements of the cosmological parameters that characterise the current cosmological concordance model , i.e. , @xmath6@xmath7 model .",
    "several techniques that offer the promise to provide such constraints have been put forward over recents years : refined versions of the sne  ia method ( @xcite ) , cosmic microwave background radiation measurements ( cosmic microwave background explorer , @xcite ; wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe , @xcite ; and more recently the planck mission , @xcite ) , and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of the above techniques have their own merits , but also their own systematic uncertainties that could become dominant with the increasingly higher level of precision required .",
    "thus , it is important to develop as many methods as possible , since the truth will likely emerge from the combination of different independent approaches . + while sne  ia",
    "have been used as the primary diagnostic in constraining cosmological parameters , type iip supernovae ( sne  iip ) have also been established to be useful independent distance indicators .",
    "sne  iip are 12 mag less luminous than the sne  ia however , their intrinsic rate is higher than sne  ia rate @xcite , and additionally the rate peaks at higher redshifts than sne  ia @xcite , which motivates their use in the cosmic distance scale ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also the fact that in principle they are the result of the same physical mechanism , and their progenitors are better understood than those of sne  ia , further encourages investigations in this direction .",
    "sne  iip are thought to be core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , i.e. , the final explosion of stars with zero - age main - sequence mass @xmath8 8 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "ccsne have diverse classes , with a large range of observed luminosities , light - curve shapes , and spectroscopic features .",
    "ccsne are classified in two groups according to the absence ( sne  ib / c : @xcite ) or presence ( sne  ii ) of lines ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "additional of the sne  iip and sne  iil which are discussed later , sne  ii are composed by sne  iib which evolve spectroscopically from sne  iip at early time to deficient few weeks to a month past maximum @xcite and sne  iin which have narrow emission lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "historically , sne  ii were separated in two groups : sne  iip ( 70% of ccsne ; @xcite ) , which are characterised by long duration plateau phases ( @xmath10  100  days ) of constant luminosity , and sne  iil which have linearly declining light - curve morphologies @xcite . however , as discussed in detail in @xcite , it is not clear how well this terminology describes the diversity of sne  ii .",
    "there are few sne  ii which show flat light - curves , and in addition there are very few ( if any ) sne which decline linearly before falling onto the radioactive tail .",
    "therefore , henceforth we simply refer to all sne with distinct decline rates collectively as sne  ii , and later further discuss sne in terms of their `` @xmath11 '' plateau decline rates @xcite .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the sne  ii family forms a continuous class , while @xcite and @xcite have argued for two separate populations .",
    "+ the most noticeable difference between sne  ii occurs during the plateau phase .",
    "the optically thick phase is physically well - understood and is due to a change in opacity and density in the outermost layers of the sn .",
    "at the beginning the hydrogen present in the outermost layers of the progenitor star is ionised by the shock wave , which implies an increase of the opacity and the density which prevent the radiation from the inner parts to escape .",
    "after a few weeks , the star has cooled to the temperature allowing the recombination of ionised hydrogen ( higher than 5000 k due to the large optical depth ) .",
    "the ejecta expand and the photosphere recedes in mass space , releasing the energy stored in the corresponding layers .",
    "the plateau morphology requires a recession of the photosphere in mass that corresponds to a fixed radius in space so that luminosity appears constant . as @xcite show ,",
    "this delicate balance is rarely observed and there is significant diversity observed in the @xmath0-band light - curve . to reproduce the plateau morphology ,",
    "hydrodynamical models have used red supergiant progenitors with extensive h envelopes @xcite .",
    "direct detections of the progenitor of sne  iip have confirmed these models ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that sn  iil progenitors may be more massive in the zero age main sequence than sne  iip @xcite and with smaller hydrogen envelopes @xcite .",
    "+ to date several methods have been developed to standardise sne  ii .",
    "the first method called the `` expanding photosphere method '' ( epm ) was developed by @xcite and allows one to obtain the intrinsic luminosity assuming that sne  ii radiate as dilute blackbodies , and that the sn freely expands with spherical symmetry .",
    "the epm was implemented for the first time on a large number of objects by @xcite and followed by many studies @xcite .",
    "one of the biggest issues with this method is the epm only works if one corrects for the blackbody assumptions which requires corrections factors computed from model atmospheres ( @xcite and see @xcite for the resolution of the epm - based distance problem to sn 1999em ) . also to avoid the problem in the estimation of the dilution factor",
    ", @xcite proposed a distance correcting factor that takes into account the departure of the sn atmosphere from a perfect blackbody , the `` spectral - fitting expanding atmosphere method '' ( seam , updated in @xcite ) .",
    "this method consists of fitting the observed spectrum using an accurate synthetic spectrum of sne  ii , and then since the spectral energy distribution is completely known from the calculated synthetic spectra , one may calculate the absolute magnitude in any band . +",
    "a simpler method , also based on photometric and spectroscopic parameters , the `` standardised candle method '' ( scm ) was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "they found that the luminosity and the expansion velocity are correlated when the sn is in its plateau phase ( 50 days post explosion ) .",
    "this relation is physically well understood : for a more luminous sn , the hydrogen recombination front will be at a larger radius thereby the velocity of the photosphere will be greater @xcite for a given post - explosion time . thanks to this method the scatter in the hubble diagram ( hereafter hubble diagram ) drops from 0.8 mag to 0.29 mag in the @xmath12-band . @xcite improved this method by adding an extinction correction based on the @xmath13 colour at day 50 after maximum .",
    "this new method is very powerful and many other studies @xcite have confirmed the possibility to use sne  ii as standard candles finding a scatter between 10 and 18% in distance .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that using near - infrared ( nir ) filters , the scm , the dispersion can drop to a level of 0.10.15 mag ( using 12 sne  iip ) .",
    "indeed , in the nir the host - galaxy extinction is less important , thus there may be less scatter in magnitude .",
    "note also the work done by @xcite where the authors used the photospheric magnitude method ( pmm ) which correspond to a generalisation of the scm for various epochs throughout the photospheric phase and found a dispersion of 0.12 mag using 13 sne .",
    "this is an intrinsic dispersion and is not the rms .",
    "+ the main purpose of this work is to derive a method to obtain purely photometric distances , i.e , standardise sne  ii only using light - curves and colour - curve parameters , unlike other methods cited above which require spectroscopic parameters .",
    "this is a big issue , and purely photometric methods will be an asset for the next generation of surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys will discover such a large number of sne that spectroscopic follow - up will be impossible for all but only for small number of events .",
    "this will prevent the use of current methods to standardise sne  ii and calculate distances .",
    "therefore deriving distances with photometric data alone is important and useful for the near future but also allows us to reach higher distance due to the fact that getting even one spectrum for a sn  ii at @xmath14 is very challenging .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 a description of the data set",
    "is given and in section 3 we explain how the data are corrected for milky way ( mw ) extinction and how the k - correction is applied . in section 4",
    "we describe the photometric colour method ( pcm ) using optical and nir filters and we derive a photometric hubble diagram . in section 5",
    "we present a comparative hubble diagram using the scm . in section 6",
    "we compare our method with the scm and we conclude with a summary in section 7 .",
    "the _ _ carnegie supernova project _ _ ( csp , @xcite ) provided all the photometric and spectroscopic data for this project .",
    "the goal of the csp was to establish a high - cadence data set of optical and nir light - curves in a well - defined and well - understood photometric system and obtain optical spectra for these same sne . between 2004 and 2009 ,",
    "the csp observed many low redshift sne  ii ( @xmath15 with @xmath16 ) , 56 had both optical and nir light - curves with good temporal coverage ; one of the largest nir data samples .",
    "two sn 1987a - like events were removed ( sn 2006v and sn 2006au see @xcite ) living the sample listed in table  [ parameters ] with photometric parameters measured by @xcite .",

    "then after removing one sn , we remove randomly two sne and again estimate the rms and the dispersion over 30000 simulations .",
    "we repeat this process until we have only 4 sne , i.e. , we remove from one sn to ( size available sample - 4 sne ) . for each simulation",
    "we compute a new model , i.e. , new fit parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath61 , and @xmath55 ) .",
    "+ from this test we conclude that when the number of sne is lower than 1012 sne the rms is very uncertain because the parameters ( i.e. , @xmath53 , @xmath61 , and @xmath55 ) start diverging ( see appendix ) .",
    "this implies that the rms is driven by the reduced number of objects so it is difficult to conclude if the model for the golden sample is better because the rms is smaller or because it is due to a statistical effect .",
    "as stated in section 4.1 , the @xmath54 colour term is related to the total - to - selective extinction ratio if the colour - magnitude relation is due to extrinsic factors ( dust ) . in the literature , for the mw , @xmath56 is known to vary from one line of sight to another , from values as low as 2.1 @xcite to values as large as 5.6 - 5.8 @xcite .",
    "in general for the mw , a value of 3.1 is used which corresponds to an average of the galactic extinction curve for diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) . using the minimisation of the hubble diagram with a colour term , in the past decade",
    "the sne  ia community has derived lower @xmath56 for host - galaxy dust than for the mw .",
    "indeed they found @xmath56 between 1.52.5 @xcite .",
    "this trend was also seen more recently using sne  ii @xcite .",
    "this could be due to unmodeled effects such as a dispersion in the intrinsic colours ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ we follow previous work in using the minimisation of the hubble diagram to obtain constraints on @xmath56 for host - galaxy dust . using the pcm , the hubble flow sample and the @xmath2 band , we find @xmath107 close to 0.98 . using a @xcite law",
    "we can transform this value in the total - to - selective extinction ratio , and we obtain , @xmath108 .",
    "following the same procedure but using the scm , we also derive low @xmath56 values , but consistent with those derived using the pcm .",
    "+ at first sight , our analysis would suggest a significantly different nature of dust in our galaxy and other spiral galaxies , as previously seen in the analysis of sne  ia and sne  ii . however , we caution the reader that the low @xmath56 values could reflect instead intrinsic magnitude - colour for sne  ii not properly modelled",
    ". to derive the @xmath56 ( or pseudo @xmath56 ) values we assume that all the sne  ii have the same intrinsic colours and same intrinsic colour - luminosity relation , however theoretical models with different masses , metallicity , show different intrinsic colours @xcite . disentangling both effects would require to know the intrinsic colours of our sn sample .",
    "indeed , with intrinsic colour - luminosity corrections the @xmath54 colour term could change and thus we will be able to derive an accurate @xmath56 . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will address this issue through different dereddening techniques ( de jaeger , in prep . )",
    "that we are currently investigating .",
    "using 38 sne  ii in the hubble flow we develop a technique based solely on photometric data ( pcm ) to build a hubble diagram based on sne  ii . in summary",
    ":    1 .   using pcm",
    "we find a dispersion of 0.44 mag using the @xmath2 band and 0.43 mag with the @xmath25 band , thus using nir filters the improvement is not so significant for the pcm .",
    "2 .   the @xmath11 plays a useful role , allowing us to reduce the dispersion from 0.58 mag to 0.50 mag for @xmath2 band .",
    "3 .   the colour term does not have so much influence on the nir filters because it is related to the host - galaxy extinction .",
    "we find very low ( @xmath61 ) values ( the colour - magnitude coefficient ) .",
    "if @xmath61 is purely extrinsic , it implies very low @xmath56 values .",
    "the hubble diagram derived from the csp sample using the scm yields to a dispersion of 0.29 mag , some what better than those found in the literature and emphasising the potential of scm in cosmology .",
    "it is interesting also to obtain more data and sne for which the initial decline rate and the plateau are clearly visible to try to reduce this dispersion .",
    "the pcm is very promising , and more efforts must be done in this direction , i.e. , trying to use only photometric parameters . in the coming era of large photometric wide  field surveys like lsst ,",
    "having spectroscopy for every sne will be impossible hence the pcm which is the first purely photometric method could be very useful .",

    "indeed if we look at the figure  [ bootstrapping_scm ] on the right where the evolution of the fit parameters versus the number of sne for one single epoch ( optd*0.55 ) and the @xmath25 band are presented , we see that for the pcm , @xmath53 , @xmath61 and @xmath55 change significantly when the number of sne is around 12 .",
