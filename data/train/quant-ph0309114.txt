    "this is the standard monte carlo wave function method which has been widely used in many physical problems of quantum optics and condensed matter theory .",
    "the idea of the monte carlo wave function method can be extended to the treatment of non - markovian quantum processes which can not be described by a markovian quantum master equation .",
    "one such method @xcite is based on a stochastic integro - differential equation for the wave function involving a non - local retarded memory kernel .",

    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 of random wave functions of the open system and by expressing the reduced density matrix with the help of the mean value @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this method of propagating a pair of wave functions requires the construction of an appropriate time - local non - markovian master equation .",
    "such an equation can be obtained with the help of the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) projection operator technique which leads to a systematic perturbation expansion for the time - dependent generator of the master equation . however ,",
    "for strong system - environment couplings calculations based on the tcl expansion become extremely complicated and the derivation of an appropriate tcl generator of high order is , in general , not feasible in practice .",
    "a further possibility is to use an explicit expression for the influence functional of the open system to obtain stochastic differential equations for a pair of random wave functions @xcite .",

    "the stochastic states of the total system are supposed to be tensor product states of the form @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the method thus involves four stochastic state vectors , namely a pair @xmath11 , @xmath12 of state vectors of the open system , and a pair @xmath13 , @xmath14 of state vectors of the environment .",
    "the open system s reduced density matrix can then be represented in terms of the expectation value @xmath15 contrary to the standard methods mentioned above , this representation employs an average over the product of two quantities : the dyadic @xmath16 of a pair of state vectors of the open system , and the scalar product @xmath17 of a corresponding pair of environment states .",

    "[ stochsimspin ] reveal that the method as formulated in sec .",
    "[ pdp ] is feasible , in general , only for short and intermediate time scales . for large times statistical errors may grow exponentially fast ,",
    "ruling out the estimation of statistical quantities with reasonable effort .",
    "however , this conclusion rests on the assumption that the stochastic states @xmath55 are tensor products of certain system and environment states .",
    "this leads to a further potential generalization of the method , namely to introduce a class of stochastic states with a more complicated structure , the aim being a more efficient representation of @xmath24 as the expectation value over the corresponding random process .",
    "since the interaction generally creates correlations between the states of system and environment it could be advantageous , e.  g. , to use a class of _ entangled _ stochastic states .",
    "the spin bath model studied in sec .",
    "[ spinbad ] leads to a trivial example : the class of entangled states defined by ( @xmath72 and @xmath361 are complex amplitudes ) @xmath362 yields an extremely efficient stochastic representation of the dynamics : as a consequence of the conservation of the 3-component of the total spin angular momentum , the subspaces spanned by the states @xmath363 and latexmath:[$|-\\rangle \\otimes    dynamics may be expressed entirely though an appropriate ( deterministic ) time - dependence of the amplitudes @xmath72 and @xmath361 .",
    "therefore , only the initial state is a random quantity and the statistical errors are constant in time .    in a further possible extension of the method",
    "one could employ a stochastic evolution of _ mixed _ states instead of pure states .",
    "as an example we introduce a stochastic matrix @xmath365 where the @xmath56 are random states of the open system and @xmath366 is a random operator in @xmath19 , and try again to find stochastic evolution equations such that the exact von neumann dynamics is recovered by means of the expectation value @xmath109 .",
