    "the study of character varieties associated to representations of @xmath3-manifold groups into @xmath4 has received great attention in recent years .",
    "indeed , the understanding of the character variety of a manifold may give some insight on the structure of the manifold itself and notably on the existence of essential surfaces , by means of culler - shalen theory @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , little is known about @xmath5-character varieties over fields of positive characteristic .",
    "it follows from work of gonzalez - acua and montesinos @xcite , that the defining polynomial equations for an @xmath5-character variety -which have coefficients in @xmath6- are the same over any field of characteristic different from @xmath7 .",
    "standard results in algebraic geometry ensure that affine variety defined by polynomials with coefficients in @xmath6 has the same geometric properties , like the dimension and the number of irreducible components , when considered over @xmath8 or over an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath9 , for almost all primes @xmath9 .",
    "this follows basically from the fact that the dimension of an affine variety ( that is , the maximal dimension of its irreducible components ) and its irreducible components can be computed algorithmically ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) for the dimension , and @xcite for the decomposition into irreducible components ) .",
    "in our situation , this says that for almost every prime @xmath10 the @xmath5-character variety for a manifold over the algebraic closure of the prime field @xmath11 looks precisely like the @xmath5-character variety over @xmath8 .",
    "it is , however , possible that for some exceptional prime @xmath12 this is not the case , and the number of its irreducible components or their dimensions might change .    our first motivation for wanting to establish the occurrence of this phenomenon comes from the fact that one may hope to find , in these special character varieties ,  new \" curves whose ideal points are associated to essential surfaces which can not be detected in characteristic @xmath13 ( see @xcite for examples of essential surfaces presenting this behaviour ) .",
    "although coming upon an actual example of surfaces detected only by curves in characteristic @xmath9 appears to be extremely hard , work by riley @xcite seems to provide evidence that this kind of phenomenon does happen , that is , there might be curves that appear only in certain characteristics .",
    "in his paper @xcite , riley studied parabolic representations ( i.e. where all meridians are sent to matrices with trace @xmath14 ) in characteristic @xmath9 for the group of a specific montesinos knot with four tangles , and showed that the group admitted a one - parameter family of non - conjugate parabolic representations for each prime @xmath9 .",
    "the straightforward observation that in characteristic @xmath9 parabolic elements have order @xmath9 implies that the orbifold whose underlying topological space is the @xmath3-sphere and whose singular set is the given montesinos knot with order of ramification equal to @xmath9 admits  several \" representations in characteristic @xmath9 , and possibly  more \" than in characteristic @xmath13 .",
    "we shall give a precise meaning to this statement in section  [ section : fp ] .",
    "the above observation motivated our study of the character variety of this and other montesinos knots in characteristic @xmath13 .",
    "we are mainly interested in understanding the geometric reason behind the existence of riley s representations , for its comprehension could lead to prove the existence of extra representations in other cases .",
    "this turns out to be related to the particular structure of the montesinos knot considered by riley , which allows to perform what riley calls ( in a subsequent paper @xcite , again on parabolic representations of knots ) the _ commuting trick_. the commuting trick boils down to the elementary remark that crossings between two arcs whose associated generators commute in a given representation are nugatory and can be arbitrarily changed .",
    "of course , riley was not the first to exploit this basic fact as riley himself remarks , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that an analysis of the character variety of the knot can be carried out explicitly only for knots whose groups have a very limited number of generators , due to the computational complexity involved .",
    "it is thus helpful to find indirect methods to deduce properties ( like the number of irreducible components , their dimensions , and their intersections ) of the character variety . we will consider a family of montesinos knots with at least @xmath15 tangles that we shall call _ montesinos knots of kinoshita - terasaka type _ ( see section  [ section : montesinos ] for a precise definition ) .",
    "using this elementary remark and _ bending _ ( see section  [ section : bending ] ) , we are able to prove for this class of knots the existence of irreducible components of large dimension in their character variety which are _ non - standard _ in that they are different from the three _ standard _ ones : the distinguished curve containing the holonomy character , the abelian component , and the teichmller components whose points are associated to representations of the base of the seifert fibration of the orbifold whose underlying topological space is the @xmath3-sphere and whose singular set is the montesinos knot with order of singularity equal to @xmath7 .",
    "these teichmller components have dimension at most @xmath16 and , since the meridian is mapped to a hyperbolic isometry of order two , the trace of the meridian is constant equal to @xmath13 on them .",
    "our first main result can thus be stated as follows :    [ theorem : simplified ] let @xmath17 be a montesinos knot of kinoshita - terasaka type with @xmath18 tangles , @xmath19 .",
    "its character variety contains ( at least ) two irreducible components of dimension @xmath20 which are not contained in the hyperplane defined by the condition that the trace of the meridian is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "this resumes two stronger and more precise statements ( theorems  [ theorem : parabolic ] and [ theorem : non parabolic ] ) whose proofs will be provided in sections  [ section : parabolic ] and [ section : bound ] .",
    "in particular , one can establish the precise dimension of these components and say something more on their number ( see theorems  [ theorem : non parabolic ] and [ theorem : dim par ] ) .",
    "[ theorem : many components ] for all integers @xmath21 and @xmath22 there is a montesinos knot of kinoshita - terasaka type with @xmath18 tangles whose character variety contains at least @xmath23 irreducible components of dimension @xmath16 .",
    "this improvement on theorem  [ theorem : simplified ] is a consequence of a result by ohtsuki , riley and sakuma on the character varieties of @xmath7-bridge knots which shows that the number of their components can be arbitrarily large @xcite .",
    "the same methods allow to prove a generalisation of theorem  [ theorem : many components ] in which the irreducible components of dimension @xmath16 are replaced by irreducible components of dimension @xmath1 for any @xmath2 ( see again theorem  [ theorem : non parabolic ] ) .",
    "although the non - standard components which are the object of theorem  [ theorem : simplified ] are obtained by bending , as already observed , the commuting trick is responsible for the existence of other non - standard components : this is for instance the case of the _ r - components _ detected by mattman in the character variety of certain pretzel knots ( * ? ?",
    "* thm 1.6 ) .",
    "the geometric interpretation behind the existence of mattman s non - standard components will be briefly discussed in section  [ section : mattman ] .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ section : characters ] we shall recall some basic facts about character varieties .",
    "the class of montesinos knots we shall be dealing with will be introduced in section  [ section : montesinos ] : there we shall also see that the knots in this class are closely related to connected sums of @xmath7-bridge knots .",
    "the main feature of connected sums of knots is that they admit several representations obtained from the representations of the single components by _ bending _ :",
    "this procedure will be described in section  [ section : bending ]",
    ". section  [ section : parabolic ] and section  [ section : non parabolic ] will be devoted to the construction respectively of non - standard components of parabolic characters and non - standard components of non - parabolic characters , whose number can be arbitrarily large thus proving theorems  [ theorem : simplified ] and [ theorem : many components ] .",
    "the contents of section  [ section : bound ] are more technical , and allow to establish the exact dimension of these non - standard components : the analysis of the parabolic components and the non - parabolic ones occupy a subsection each ( subsections  [ subsect : nonparabolic ] and [ section : more_on_intersections ] ) .",
    "finally , we shall discuss mattman s non - standard components ( section  [ section : mattman ] ) and comment on the character varieties of montesinos knots of kinoshita - terasaka type over fields of positive characteristic ( section  [ section : fp ] ) .",
    "the variety of representations of a finitely generated group @xmath24 is the set of representations of @xmath24 in @xmath4 : @xmath25 since @xmath24 is finitely generated , @xmath26 can be embedded in a product @xmath27 by mapping each representation to the image of a generating set . in this way",
