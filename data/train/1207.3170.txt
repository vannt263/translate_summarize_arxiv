    "higher twist terms contribute to the nucleon structure functions at lower scales @xmath4 .",
    "the range in which these terms may be safely neglected against the leading twist contributions , partly depends on the size of the experimental errors in the respective measurement .",
    "highly precise data at low values of @xmath4 allow to access these contributions , the detailed physical understanding of which is presently still in an early stage .",
    "it has been outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite how the higher twist contributions can be extracted in a phenomenological way in case of the structure functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the valence quark region . in this note",
    "we report on recent results of an improved analysis .",
    "another interesting question concerns the structure function @xmath3 in the polarized case , which has been measured to a higher precision during the last years @xcite . here",
    "we try to extract first information on the twist-3 contributions to @xmath3 .",
    "we have carried out a qcd analysis in the valence region including more recent data from jlab following earlier work @xcite . in the present analysis tails from sea - quarks and the gluon in the valence region were dealt with based on the abkm distributions @xcite .",
    "both the valence quark distributions @xmath7 and @xmath8 at @xmath9 are effected only very little .",
    "the values of @xmath10 change marginally w.r.t .",
    "the earlier analysis @xcite .",
    "we obtain  : @xmath11 . here",
    ", the n@xmath1lo@xmath12-analysis accounts for the three - loop wilson coefficients and a pad - model for the non - singlet four - loop anomalous dimension , to which we attached a @xmath13 uncertainty , cf .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "furthermore , we found that the response of the individual deep - inelastic data sets in the valence region respond stable values , which are in accordance with the central value obtained moving from nlo to n@xmath1lo@xmath12 .",
    "the present result agrees very well with determinations of @xmath10 in refs .",
    "@xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "a survey on the current status of @xmath10 based on precision measurements in different reactions has been given in @xcite .",
    "in the present analysis we obtain a lower value of @xmath14 than the world average , cf .",
    "@xcite , and values being obtained in @xcite at nnlo .",
    "reasons for the difference to the values given in @xcite have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in detail .",
    "in particular , the partial response of @xmath14 in case of the bcdms and slac data in @xcite turns out to be partly different comparing to the results in @xcite .",
    "there are also differences between the analyses @xcite and @xcite w.r.t .",

    "we applied the target mass corrections @xcite to the leading twist contributions . and @xmath19 including the jlab data , has been performed in @xcite recently . ]",
    "the result for the higher twist coefficients for proton and deuteron targets depends on the order to which the leading twist distribution is described .",
    "the higher twist terms become smaller moving from nlo to n@xmath1lo@xmath12 . within the present theoretical and experimental accuracy",
    "the curves stabilize for @xmath20 , while at larger values there are still differences .",
    "higher twist contributions to the polarized structure function @xmath22 have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in phenomenological approaches aiming on the twist-4 contributions . however , the structure function @xmath3 , together with other polarized electro - weak structure functions @xcite , receives also twist-3 contributions .",
    "@xmath3 obeys the burkhardt - cottingham relation @xcite @xmath23 since the wandzura - wilczek relation @xcite implies , that the first moment of the twist-2 part vanishes separately also @xmath24 holds .",
    "the errors on the present world data from e143 , e155 , hermes and nmc @xcite on @xmath3 are still large but yet one may try the fit of a profile in @xmath2 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the parameterization @xmath25                   + ( 1-x)^3\\left[b - c(1-x ) + d(1-x)^2\\right ] \\label{sha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has been proposed .",
    "since the data points are measured at different values of @xmath4 an evolution has to be performed to a common scale .",
    "furthermore , the target mass corrections @xcite have to be taken into account . in figure",
    "2 the results of the fit to @xmath21 are presented for @xmath26 .",
    "we limited the analysis to the region @xmath27 .",
    "the present errors are still large and the data of e155 dominate in the fit .",
    "we may compare with a theoretical prediction given in @xcite .",
    "indeed both results are quite similar .",
    "the twist-3 contribution to the structure function @xmath22 can be obtained from that to @xmath3 by the integral - relation @xcite @xmath28~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] cf .  @xcite . due to the large errors of the data the present results are of more qualitative character . to study the twist-3 contributions both to the structure functions @xmath3 and @xmath22 in detail , a high luminosity machine , like the planned eic @xcite ,",
    "is needed .",
    "we performed a re - analysis of the present deep - inelastic world data on proton and deuteron targets for the structure function @xmath5 in the valence region @xmath29 accounting for remaining non - valence tails , which were calculated using the abkm09 distributions @xcite .",
    "we obtain a slightly lower value of @xmath10 than in our previous analysis @xcite at n@xmath1lo@xmath12 , however , far within the @xmath30 error range .",
    "very stable predictions are obtained going from nlo to n@xmath1lo@xmath12 , both for the valence distribution functions and @xmath10 .",
    "the values being obtained for the different sub - sets of experimental data in the present fit are well in accordance with our global result .",
    "we do not confirm the significant differences reported by mstw between the slac @xmath31 and @xmath32 data at nnlo @xcite .",
    "we also disagree with the large value of nnpdf @xcite for the bcdms data at nlo , which also contradicts the corresponding result by mstw @xcite .",
    "our results are in agreement with those of the gjr collaboration @xcite and the singlet analyses @xcite .",
    "we obtained an update of the dynamical higher twist contributions to @xmath0 in the valence region , which depends on the order to which the leading twist contributions were calculated .",
    "the effect stabilizes including corrections up to n@xmath1lo@xmath12 in the range @xmath33 . at larger values of @xmath2",
    "still higher order corrections may be needed . a first estimate on the quarkonic twist-3 contributions to the polarized structure function @xmath3",
    "is given in a fit to the available world data on @xmath3 .",
    "the contributions to @xmath22 are obtained by an integral relation , cf . ref .",
