    "hadron structure is probed by deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "much effort has been devoted by theorists to compute quark or gluon distribution functions and proton structure functions from qcd with non perturbative methods .",
    "e.g. , martinelli et al.@xcite have computed the first two moments of the pion structure function .",
    "these calculations are notoriously difficult ; for the present status of lattice calculations based on the euclidean action formulation see ref.@xcite . in order to compute structure functions",
    "it seems natural to use the hamiltonian formulation that allows to compute wave functions .",
    "e.g. , scattering wave functions for glueball - like states in compact @xmath3 have been computed in a hamiltonian formulation on a momentum lattice@xcite . for a review of hamiltonian lattice methods see@xcite@xcite .",
    "the usefulness of a momentum lattice to compute physics close to a critical point has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite@xcite for the @xmath4-model .",
    "unfortunately , hamiltonian methods are known to pose problems when calculating the huge number of field degrees of freedom due to particle number .",
    "nobody has yet succeeded in seeing scaling laws indicating continuum physics in a @xmath5-hamiltonian formulation , to the best of the authors knowledge . in this work",
    "we shall demonstrate that these difficulties can be overcome .",
    "we introduce a new type of regularisation which excludes all parton momenta that we deem to be not directly related to deep inelastic structure measurements .",
    "it turns out that such a regularisation scheme provides both an ultraviolet as well as a particle cutoff .",
    "we have chosen to test our method on the popular scalar @xmath4 theory in _ four _ space - time dimensions because this model has been thoroughly investigated numerically and analytically .",
    "the principal results are :    \\1 . using a hamiltonian approach we observe continuum physics ( scaling laws close to the critical line ) for the @xmath6 and we see    \\2 .",
    "altarelli - parisi - type behaviour of @xmath7 distribution functions in two , three and four dimensions and a peak at @xmath8 similar to the peak occurring in quark distribution functions .",
    "physical observables of relativistic field theories depend continuously on the experimental resolution .",
    "every experiment has a finite resolution and coarse - grains the observed system .",
    "this corresponds _ cum grano salis _ to a regularisation of the field theory which describes the observed system .",
    "the hadron structure functions that we attempt to calculate are a prominent example .",
    "the most important experiment in order to probe the structure of hadrons is deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "its simplest form is inclusive scattering of an unpolarised lepton off a hadronic target which we want to build our method upon . for the basics of dis",
    "see , e.g.@xcite .",
    "notation : the hadron in its ground state with four momentum @xmath9 interacts with the probing lepton by the exchange of a virtual photon ( our neutrino ) with space - like four - momentum @xmath10 . in feynman s parton model , the impulse approximation is invoked .",
    "it is assumed that the proton consists of constituents , the partons , that are weakly bound when compared to the resolution ability @xmath11 of the probing photon . in this approximation ,",
    "the so - called bjrken scaling variable @xmath12 can be interpreted as the momentum fraction of the struck parton in the breit frame ( which is defined by the requirements that the photon energy @xmath13 be zero and that the momentum @xmath14 point in the opposite direction of the hadron momentum @xmath15 ) . in this model ,",
    "structure functions @xmath16 can be interpreted as some linear combinations of parton momentum distribution functions @xmath17 .",
    "for details see@xcite .",
    "we want to design a theory where just this picture emerges , describing only the coarse - grained particles that are probed in a dis experiment .",
    "consequently , we have to devise a regularisation that mimics the coarse - graining due to experiment as close as possible . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we have to decide on a conveniant lorentz frame , because firstly the hamiltonian is only defined with respect to such a frame and , secondly , a parton being a virtual particle is only defined with respect to the specific relativistic frame where experiment performs its coarse - graining of space .",
    "seen from a different lorentz frame , the parton would emerge as a jet of many partons because the boost generators of the poincar group contain vertices that change the parton number ! our candidate is the breit frame , of course .",
    "the struck parton in the breit frame , however , is collinear to the hadron momentum .",
    "thus , we have to allow for non - collinear partons in more than one space dimension .",
    "therefore we use a _ generalised breit frame _ where @xmath18 but @xmath14 does _ not _ have to be collinear to @xmath15 .",
    "please note that only in such a generalised breit frame is @xmath19 and only there can the wave length @xmath20 of the virtual photon be interpreted as the resolution ability of the experiment !",
    "please note also that the momentum @xmath15 strongly restricts the domain of all possible photon momenta @xmath14 in the generalised breit frame .",
    "we require therefore that the _ observable fock space _",
    "consist only of partons whose momenta can ( but need not ) reverse momentum @xmath21 if struck by a virtual photon in the generalised breit frame .",
    "parton momenta that can not be related by @xmath22 to some virtual photon with momentum @xmath14 are skipped .",
    "then all observable momenta _ of the ground state _",
    "lie inside a sphere    @xmath23    around @xmath24 with diameter @xmath25 because @xmath26 lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "if we go onto a momentum space lattice with momenta @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an integer vector and @xmath29 is the momentum lattice spacing , then the constraint ( [ criterion ] ) on the parton momenta provides an ultraviolet as well as a particle cutoff .",
    "this holds because only a finite number of partons with _ positive _ longitudinal momentum @xmath30 can share the _ positive _ total longitudinal momentum @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the direction of the total hadron .",
    "if one performs the continuum limit , the system s velocity @xmath33 grows and one ends up with the velocity of light . for a parton with momentum fraction",
    "@xmath34 the continuum limit @xmath35 also implies @xmath36 and hence is equivalent to the bjrken limit . by the way , the transverse momenta in this limit are suppressed by the increasingly dominant kinetic term , at least in asymptotically free and trivial theories .",
    "since we want to calculate the critical line  which depends on the regularisation  we had to ensure that our regularisation([criterion ] ) be well comparable to to the lattice regularisation of ref.@xcite .",
    "to this aim we started on the usual lattice with the position space lattice spacing @xmath37 as ultraviolet regulator , where @xmath38 denotes the number of lattice points in each space direction , and put the total momentum @xmath15 on one of the edges @xmath39 of the momentum lattice .",
    "if we then apply our regularisation([criterion ] ) , every component of the parton momenta is positive , i.e the combination of our regularisation with the lattice cutoff restricts the parton momenta to the first octant of the momentum lattice which further simplifies the set - up of the fock space .",
    "the maximal number of partons equals @xmath40 in this description .",
    "we ought to add that for a small lattice such as @xmath41 the additional lattice spacing cutoff does not exclude states that are allowed by our regularisation ",
    "so this seems to be o.k ..    a further feature of the proposed ansatz is remarkable : the connection between boosts and renormalisation group transformations .",
    "a boost that reduces the total momentum @xmath25 equally reduces the number of observable fock states in our approach and hence constitutes a coarse - graining procedure on a momentum grid with fixed infrared regularisation in contrast to that , a boost without our regularisation would increase the ( unobservable ) particle number . since the hadron momentum @xmath42 is the cutoff in our approach , the scale @xmath43 is reduced and the bare parameters have to be re - adjusted .",
    "this means that such a boost acts in a way similar to a renormalisation group transformation in the kadanoff / wilson sense .",
    "such a transformation is not invertible .",
    "intuitively this corresponds to the fact that decreasing the momentum of the probing lepton relative to the target hadron corresponds to a lesser structure resolution .",
    "if @xmath25 gets too small we have coarse - grained too much and the system breaks down , of course . in the momentum - sector with @xmath44 only one state , the vacuum , remains . within our method we can not describe a hadron in its rest frame , just as one can not perform structure measurements without a particle beam moving relative to the target .",
    "this means that we can not give a fock space expansion of the physical vacuum either .",
    "this is no draw - back , it is a desirable feature .",
    "it makes simply no sense to calculate structure functions for the vacuum . we treat it as a background field with the same quantum numbers as the perturbative vacuum because only vacuum expectation values of fields or of the energy ( casimir effect ) originate from the vacuum",
    "the fact that the perturbative vacuum is annihilated by our hamiltonian does not mean that it is the physical vacuum the latter one is far from being trivial .",
    "it only means that per constructionem our theory is designed for deep inelastic scattering and breaks down if we set @xmath15 equal zero .",
    "if we , however , boost the momentum grid also , the transformation is an invertible scale transformation making the physical quantities change according to the callan - symanzik equation .",
    "three little remarks at the end of this section :    \\1 .",
    "theoretically , our regularisation([criterion ] ) admits partons with zero momentum .",
    "an infinite number of these can be present because they do not take away longitudinal momentum .",
    "it is these that are responsible for vacuum expectation values .",
    "fortunately , for a system with _ spontaneous _ symmetry breaking as the @xmath4 theory , we can treat them on the _ classical _ level since at least in the infinite volume limit , quantum mechanical fluctuations of the vacuum expectation values must vanish . to describe the axial anomaly of a non - abilian gauge theories , however , we shall have to allow for dynamic gauge fields with zero momentum in order to describe fluctuations of the dirac sea .",
    "it is obvious that our approach sheds some light on the relation of the so - called front- and instant forms@xcite in two dimensions .",
    "a discussion of this must be reserved for another paper .",
    "our method would , of course , permit to calculate the hadronic tensor and thus the structure functions directly from the electromagnetic courrent operators .",
    "but the calculation of distribution functions is much easier .",
    "now we apply our method to the @xmath45 theory as a testing ground",
    ". we shall compare it to some existing results@xcite@xcite in the lattice regularisation .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath4 theory is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the scalar field , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the bare mass and coupling constant respectively .",
    "we set the scale @xmath50 to one and insert the discretised and quantised solution    @xmath51    of the kinetic field equations of motion back into the hamiltonian , where @xmath52 are the usual annihilation and creation operators @xmath53=\\delta_{\\vec k,\\vec l}$ ] respectively and @xmath54 is the kinetic energy of a parton .",
    "this yields the discretised hamiltonian that we diagonalised .",
    "we denote the n - th eigenvalue of the hamiltonian matrix as @xmath55 and the n - th physical mass as @xmath56 . we did not normal order  which would not have been allowed for an interacting hamiltonian  but we subtracted the vacuum energy .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the requirement that the perturbative vacuum be annihilated by the hamiltonian . _",
    "only _ if the vacuum - energy @xmath57 is gauged to be zero can we use the mass - shell condition @xmath56 to calculate the physical mass spectrum from the energy spectrum .",
    "we do not have to take the field renormalisation constant @xmath58 into account , but one problem arises .",
    "the critical line lies entirely in the region where @xmath59 is negative and we can not build up the fock - space in terms of partons with imaginary masses . instead , we have chosen to build it up in terms of partons with mass @xmath60 by splitting the @xmath61 mass term into a kinetic @xmath62 and a dynamic @xmath63 part where @xmath64 is the kinetic energy of the partons and @xmath65 is a sufficiently large negative number that takes the rle of a coupling constant .",
    "we have presented our results for the choice @xmath66 .",
    "we have found , however , that the critical behaviour was almost independent of a specific choice of @xmath60 in the @xmath67-sector , if only @xmath68 is reasonably small .",
    "we diagonalised the described hamiltonian on a @xmath69 and a @xmath70 lattice . to do this ,",
    "fock spaces of only 6 resp .",
    "21 states are needed(and even less if the @xmath71 symmetry is removed in the symmetric phase ) . in order to compare our results to the work of lscher and weisz@xcite and to the work of d. brub et al .",
    "@xcite we have to introduce the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 which are related to @xmath48 and @xmath72 by @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in fig.1",
    "the first of the three data columns of the renormalised masses @xmath76 in terms of @xmath73 as given by lscher and weisz is shown and compared to our ground state masses @xmath77 .",
    "we have diagonalised the hamiltonian for @xmath78 different bare parameters @xmath79 and fitted the results to obtain the energy spectra in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "1 that the shape of the function is well described even on the @xmath69-lattice . for the @xmath70-lattice we are able to describe most of the scaling region @xmath80 .",
    "the ground state mass @xmath81 inside the validity domain @xmath82 of our model is seen to obey the scaling law @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a constant@xcite and @xmath85 denotes the reduced temperature , meaning that we have correctly described the critical exponent @xmath86 plus the logarithmic correction @xmath87 in our _ hamiltonian _ approach .",
    "it can also be seen that the critical point is well reproduced .",
    "this is true also for curves of different @xmath72 close to the gaussian fixed point as it is shown in table 1 . where we listed the quotients @xmath88 ; the quantity @xmath89 denotes the point where the renormalised mass @xmath77 becomes imaginary(it becomes real again in the asymmetric phase if we break the @xmath71 symmetry by choosing a non zero field expectation value . ) .",
    "table 1 shows that the quantity @xmath90 is an excellent estimator for the critical line . in fig.2 finally",
    ", the mass spectrum related to the first excited state , @xmath91 , is depicted for fixed @xmath72 in terms of @xmath73 .",
    "it clearly demonstrates the fact that the partons of the @xmath6 theory interact by repulsive forces .",
    "the first state above the vacuum is a one particle state with negative parity and the positive parity state above consists of two particles .",
    "since the @xmath4 theory describes partons with repulsive two particle exchange forces and since it has a trivial , i.e. free continuum limit , its distribution functions are not comparable to the qcd structure functions . in the @xmath4 theory , a renormalisation group transformation(rgt ) decreases the lattice size as well as the marginal coupling constant . in an asymptotically free theory such as qcd , the coupling constant increases under such a transformation .",
    "this means a rgt enforces particle creation for qcd , whereas particle creation is weakened for the scalar theory . since the renormalisation group in the wilson / kadanoff sense is used to make a complicated system numerically tractable by coarse - graining it into a theory with equivalent long distance behaviour , this means for the @xmath4-theory that the coarse - grained system has a strongly reduced particle content so that a particle cutoff may be applied after a few rgts .",
    "this can not be expected to hold for qcd where a rgt actually increases the interaction .",
    "this effect slows down or may even invert the net particle number decimation of a rgt due to a reduction of momentum space points and this is the problem we designed our method for .",
    "the distribution function @xmath17 of finding some parton with momentum fraction @xmath92 inside the hadron is determined by the parton momentum distribution function @xmath93 for finding a parton with momentum @xmath94 inside the hadron with momentum @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath95 is a dimensionful quantity , its scale is set by the lattice spacing @xmath96 and thus depends on the bare parameters if one keeps the renormalised mass fixed .",
    "the continuum limit @xmath35 corresponds to the the limit towards arbitrarily high resolution ability .",
    "if one keeps the renormalised mass and the renormalised coupling constant fixed , then @xmath95 is a function of the bare coupling constant @xmath49 and vice versa  invertibility of @xmath97 assumed .",
    "hence @xmath17 is related by the function @xmath97 to the distribution function @xmath98 that only depends on dimensionless parameters .",
    "consequently , a calculation of the distribution function along a renormalisation group trajectory can be used to compute some peculiarities of the @xmath95-dependence of the quark structure functions such as the increasing of the peak at @xmath8 when the resolution @xmath95 is increased . in order to demonstrate that the suggested method is capable of describing them , we calculate the distribution functions of the @xmath99 theory whose forces are attractive one particle exchange forces .",
    "although this theory is known to suffer from an unstable vacuum , it serves well for our purpose of demonstrating qualitatively that the singularity at @xmath8 and its change in terms of the resolution @xmath95 of experimentally measured structure functions can be modelled in our approach ( the unstable vacuum of the @xmath99 theory does not allow us to calculate meaningful ground state masses that are needed to specify renormalisation group trajectories and consequently the exact relation between the resolution @xmath95 and the bare coupling constant @xmath49 .",
    "but the distribution function @xmath98 suffices for our purposes ) . to increase the number of particles that can be modeled on our tiny workstation , we have chosen to present the results of the two dimensional @xmath100 theory .",
    "the results , however , are qualitatively alike in higher dimensions except for the smaller particle number . in fig.3",
    "we depict the function @xmath98 to illustrate that our method is  at least in principle ",
    "powerful enough to describe the known features of the proton structure function .",
    "this can _ by no means _ be taken for granted .",
    "fock space methods that have to apply a low particle number cutoff in addition to the phase space cutoff are in principle unable to show this feature@xcite .",
    "this is so because a system of n identical _ observable _ particles must have an expectation value of @xmath92 around @xmath101 for symmetry reasons .",
    "furthermore , the behaviour of the structure functions in terms of the resolution @xmath95 is dominated not by the power law rest effects of the interaction between the partons but rather by the fact that a higher resolution power unveils _ more _ particles to the observer . with a low particle number cutoff",
    ", the splitting functions appearing in the altarelli - parisi equations would be meaningless , anyway .",
    "for the @xmath4 theory , however , an additional particle cutoff is perfectly feasible for describing the lowest - lying eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "we have shown that the suggested principle that only measurable quantities be described works well for the scalar theory .",
    "even a @xmath102 hamiltonian matrix is able to correctly describe important features of the critical behaviour of the @xmath4-theory .",
    "we are , however , aware of the fact that there is a huge difference between the scalar @xmath6-theory which does not even possess a nontrivial continuum limit and nonabilian gauge theories which do possess a continuum limit with strongly bound particles and also an additional topological structure .",
    "but we have reasons for being optimistic .",
    "our method has been designed to sooth one major nuisance of highly relativistic systems , the uncontrolled particle production .",
    "this feature has not even been necessary for the @xmath4 theory where we could introduce a _",
    "modest _ particle cutoff without mutilating the results .",
    "this is encouraging since we did not aim at the scalar theory in the first place .",
    "the aim is the calculation of structure functions , one of the outstanding problems of particle physics , directly from @xmath5 where high particle numbers are inevitable .",
    "we hope that our results can be extended to gauge theories and stress that the suggested method has the power to significantly simplify the kogut susskind hamiltonian because it also works on a position space lattice .",
    "this is important since there is no @xmath5 hamiltonian for momentum space available yet .",
    "the kogut - susskind hamiltonian being a position space method is plagued by mirror fermions .",
    "our approach , taking only parton momenta of the first octant in the brillouin zone , _ formally _ eliminates them from the set of observable partons , which seems to be a remedy to this problem ( we break the mirror - symmetry by the choice of a specific hadron momentum @xmath15 different from @xmath103 ) .",
    "if this suffices to describe the axial anomaly remains to be seen .",
    "we have to be very cautious here : the nielsen - ninomiya no - go theorem@xcite has yet always resisted attempts to circumnavigate it .",
