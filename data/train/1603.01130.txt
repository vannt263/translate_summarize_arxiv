    "the physical realization of a large - scale quantum information processing ( qip ) architecture constitutes a fascinating problem at the interface between fundamental science and engineering @xcite .",
    "further advances towards this goal hinge upon two major challenges : ( i ) control over the undesired influences of the environment which tend to corrupt genuine quantum properties such as entanglement , and ( ii ) long - range coupling between the logical qubits .",
    "the latter not only relaxes some serious architectural challenges @xcite but also allows for applications in quantum communication , distributed quantum computing , and some of the highest tolerances in error - correcting codes that are based on long - distance entanglement links @xcite .    in the solid state ,",
    "electron spins confined in electrically defined semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have emerged as a promising platform for qip @xcite : major building blocks such as initialization , single - shot readout , coherent control of single spins , and two - qubit gates between adjacent spins have been demonstrated successfully in proof - of - principle experiments .",
    "however , at present the integration of several qubits into a scalable architecture still remains a formidable challenge @xcite .",
    "a large amount of wiring and control electronics needs to be accommodated on a very small scale , since interactions between qds are very short - range , enabling qip setups with nearest - neighbor interactions only .",
    "therefore , a scalable design is likely to require _ long - range _ couplings over distances of several micrometers @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a scheme for deterministic preparation of _ steady - state _ entanglement between _ remote _ qubits , defined by electron spins in spatially separated qds .",
    "our approach addresses the two challenges ( i ) and ( ii ) as described above within one unified framework : ( i ) by suitably engineering the continuous coupling of the system to its environment , our setup actively utilizes dissipation to create and stabilize quantum coherences , turning dissipation into the driving force behind the emergence of coherent quantum phenomena .",
    "this approach @xcite comes with potentially significant advantages over previous proposals @xcite which aim at a coherent coupling between remote spins , as dissipative methods are unaffected by timing and preparation errors and inherently robust against weak random perturbations , allowing us to stabilize entanglement for arbitrary times @xcite .",
    "( ii ) our scheme directly builds upon recent experimental developments towards the realization of a solid - state electronic quantum bus , where flying electrons take over the role of photons in more conventional atomic , molecular , and optical based approaches in order to mediate long - range coupling between remote qubits .",
    "in particular , we consider quantum hall edge ( qhe ) channels @xcite and surface acoustic waves ( saws ) @xcite as exemplary candidate systems for the coherent transport of electron spins over long distances .",
    "intuitively , the dissipative entanglement creation arises from a quantum interference effect in the _ common _ coupling of the localized spins @xmath0 to an adjacent electronic quantum channel , in which flying electrons continuously pass by the two localized spins . with any which - way information",
    "absent , first - order spin - flip processes between the localized spins and the flying ancilla spins occurring in the course of electron transport can happen either in the first _ or _ in the second node , which may lead to the formation of entanglement between the nodes , if two or more such processes with a unique common entangled steady - state dominate the dynamics @xcite .",
