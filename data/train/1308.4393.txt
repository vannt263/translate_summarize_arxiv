    "all single stars with initial masses in the range @xmath9 are predicted to end their lives as red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "these stars are expected to end their evolution with a core - collapse induced supernova ( sn ) explosion ; with the massive h - rich envelope , retained by the rsg , giving rise to the characteristic light curve plateau and h - dominated spectra of type iip sne .",
    "+ although there have been efforts to infer the properties of the progenitor star through interpreting the observed characteristics of the subsequent sn , the direct observation of the progenitor in fortuitous pre - explosion images has provided direct constraints on the properties of the progenitors independently of models of how sne explode .",
    "the greatest success in the direct detection of the progenitors has been for the type iip sne , originating from rsgs @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the population of observed and undetected progenitors with mass constraints , showed that type iip sne appear to only arise from progenitor stars in the mass range @xmath10 , implying that rsgs evolving from more massive stars were either exploding as a different type of sn or , perhaps , not exploding as observable sne .",
    "@xcite referred to the observed deficit of massive rsg progenitors as the `` rsg problem '' .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have explored the role of dust in the circumstellar mediums ( csms ) of rsgs progenitors , in addition to foreground galactic and host reddening components , in dimming the most massive and luminous progenitors ( @xmath11 ) , causing the masses determined for these rsgs to be systematically under - estimated @xcite . the determination of the masses of the progenitors stars of type iip sne have , however , relied on observations of fortuitous nature .",
    "these observations are often shallow and have limited wavelength coverage .",
    "the direct assessment of the roles of multiple reddening components have , therefore , been undermined by the degeneracies between the different parameters ( in particular reddening and temperature ) which can not generally be broken with the available data and which , therefore , have serious consequences for the determination of the luminosity and mass of the progenitors .",
    "the application of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) techniques to progenitor stars detected in pre - explosion images provides a robust method to evaluate the degeneracies between parameters and quantitatively explore the consequences of additional reddening components .",
    "@xcite showed , using marcs synthetic spectra , that previous observations of the progenitors of type iip sne were not consistent with large amounts of csm dust with composition and reddening law significantly different to dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this could imply that dust may not be a solution to the rsg problem .",
    "sn  2008bk was discovered by @xcite on 2008 mar 25.14 , which @xcite subsequently placed @xmath12e and @xmath13n of the centre of the host galaxy ngc 7793 .",
    "@xcite also identified a possible red star close to the position of sn  2008bk in the pre - explosion images , for which @xcite reported european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) isaac @xmath14 and @xmath15 photometry .",
    "previously @xcite and @xcite have presented the full identification and parameterisation of the progenitor , independently determining the initial mass of the progenitor to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "@xcite later reported the subsequent disappearance of the progenitor , confirming the identity of the red supergiant observed in pre - explosion images .    due to the wealth of multi - wavelength pre - explosion observations ,",
    "the progenitor of sn  2008bk presents the opportunity to provide the best constraints for the progenitors of any sn since sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "here we present new late - time observations of the site of sn  2008bk , acquired with the gemini south telescope , the european southern observatory very large telescope ( vlt ) and the hubble space telescope to open a new window onto the nature of the progenitor object .",

    "the results of these new observations are presented in section [ sec : res ] , and the outcome of our extensive analysis is represented in section [ sec : ana ] . in section [ sec : disc ]",
    "we present a discussion of our results and our conclusions .",
    "the details of the pre - explosion , post - explosion and late - time images used here are presented in table [ tab : obs ] .      the pre - explosion eso vlt fors , hawk - i and isaac observations were previously presented by @xcite ( the near - infrared images were also used by @xcite ) .",
    "late - time vlt observations of the site of sn  2008bk were acquired with almost identical instrument configurations as the pre - explosion observations , as part of program 087.d-0587 ( pi maund ) ; these late - time vlt observations were acquired under photometric conditions .",
    "the near - infrared hawk - i and isaac late - time observations were acquired using identical instrument configurations as the pre - explosion observations @xmath18 after explosion .",
    "the late - time fors observations were acquired with a close approximation of the instrument configuration used for the pre - explosion observations : the pre - explosion observations utilised the fors1 instrument with the tektronix detector providing a pixel scale of @xmath19 , whereas the late - time observations used the newly designated fors instrument ( originally fors2 ) with the red optimised mit detectors providing a pixel scale @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced using the corresponding eso pipelines .",
    "the fors data were bias and flatfield corrected in the standard fashion .",
    "the infra - red hawk - i and isaac data were bias , flat corrected and sky subtracted ( using interleaved sky offset frames ) before combination .",
    "photometry of the late - time frames was conducted using iraf and the point spread function ( psf ) fitting routines in the daophot package .",
    "the data were photometrically calibrated with zeropoints , colour terms and extinction coefficients derived from observations of standard fields , acquired on the same nights .",
    "the pre - explosion and late - time fors observations were conducted with the bessell @xmath21 filters , but the corresponding zeropoints and colour terms were used to place the photometry in the johnson - cousins @xmath21 photometric system .",
    "the hawk - i and isaac data were similarly calibrated using observations of infrared standard stars in the @xmath22 filters .",
    "the @xmath23 zeropoints were checked against photometry of bright stars in the late - time images that were also in the 2mass point source catalogue , with a corresponding dispersion of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "the pre - explosion photometry was bootstrapped to the photometric calibration of the late - time images .",
    "the pre - explosion gemini gmos - s observations were previously presented by @xcite .",
    "we attempted to re - identify the data used by @xcite in the gemini archive , according to the description of observations provided by @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard fashion using iraf and the specific gemini data reduction package .",
    "the data were bias and flatfield corrected , and the individual chips for each exposure were combined to produce mosaiced images .",

    "r _ and _ i _ photometry was originally in the ab magnitude system and was converted to vega magnitudes with the addition of the constants + 0.102 , -0.165 and -0.403 mags , respectively , derived through synthetic photometry of the spectrum of vega @xcite .",
    "additional late - time observations of the site of sn  2008bk were acquired with the @xmath1 wide field camera 3 ultraviolet - visible ( uvis ) and infrared ( ir ) channels , with the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 filters .",
    "the observations were acquired as part of program go-12262 ( pi maund ) . for each filter , four separate exposures in a four - point box dither pattern .",
    "the separate exposures were combined using the multidrizzle package , running under pyraf , to achieve better sampling than the native pixel scale affords from a single pointing .",
    "the observations were conducted using the smaller @xmath32 and @xmath33 pixel subarrays of the uvis2 and ir detectors .",
    "the uvis @xmath29 image was drizzled to a final pixel scale of @xmath34 , while the ir observations were drizzled to a final pixel scale of @xmath35 .",
    "photometry of the images was conducted using daophot , running as part of iraf .",
    "empirical aperture corrections were determined to final aperture sizes of @xmath36 , and the standard vegamag zero points were adopted .",
    "the uvis2 @xmath29 image was further corrected for charge transfer inefficiency using the calibration of @xcite , following the scheme outlined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as there were no corresponding pre - explosion hst images , the late - time observations were used to probe the nature of the underlying background flux that may have contributed to the pre - explosion ground - based observations .",
    "the position of the sn in the pre - explosion and late - time images was determined using differential astrometry with respect to the position of the sn observed in a post - explosion vlt naco adaptive - optics @xmath15image ( presented by * ? ? ?",
    "transformations between the post - explosion @xmath15 image and the late - time images were calculated using the iraf task geomap .",
    "the post - explosion image was used to directly determine the position of the sn on the late - time @xmath37 images ; and the positions on the @xmath38 and @xmath39 images were further used to determine the sn position on the @xmath40 and @xmath41 images respectively . the sn position on the pre - explosion frames",
    "was determined using transformations calculated between the pairs of late - time and pre - explosion images with the same filters .      in each image , where objects of interest were not detected ,",
    "the detection threshold was determined using artificial star tests .",
    "artificial stars were placed in the images , at the positions where the detection thresholds were to be determined , utilising the psfs derived from previous stages of photometry with daophot .",
    "recovery of the artificial stars was then attempted using daophot in the same configuration used for the original photometry of the images .",
    "the completion function for the recovery of the artificial stars , as a function of magnitude , was approximated by a cumulative normal distribution , with mean at @xmath42 completeness and the standard deviation corresponding to the breadth of the function .",
    "following @xcite , we use the image subtraction package _",
    "isis _ to subtract the late - time images from the pre - explosion images , to derive precise photometry of the now absent progenitor object .",
    "the late - times images were transformed to match the coordinate system of the pre - explosion images ; as the late - time images were generally taken under better seeing conditions than the pre - explosion images , this resulted in a slight degradation of image quality of the late - time images , but still better than the pre - explosion images .",
    "the late - time images were then used as the template frames to be subtracted from the pre - explosion images , except in the case of isaac @xmath14 and @xmath15 frames for which the pre - explosion images were acquired under better seeing .",
    "aperture photometry was conducted on the residuals in the difference image , as part of the _ isis _ package ( this was checked against aperture photometry with daophot , and the differences were found to be negligible ) .",
    "the zeropoint was determined relative to aperture photometry of non - varying stars in the same field and their photometry derived using daophot ( see section [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "although _ isis _ derives the usual statistical uncertainties from aperture photometry , the additional systematic uncertainty in using _",
    "isis _ was estimated by conducting multiple iterations of the image subtraction process with the settings modified .",
    "this allowed us to quantify the effect of various parameters , such as : the number of stamps used to calculate the convolution kernel to match the psfs of the template and input images ; the degree of the fit to the background ; the degree of the spatial variability of the kernel ; and the size of the aperture and background annulus used for the photometry of the residuals .",

    "observations we have estimated the residual sn flux contamination to our template subtraction analysis , as well as demonstrated that there is little contamination at ir wavelengths from surrounding stars . in the optical , the complex and crowded nature of the region hosting the sn most probably leads to overestimates of the progenitor brightness from photometry of the pre - explosion observations alone . with the revised sed , constructed from improved photometry , we have shown the progenitor has a relatively high mass for a type iip sn progenitor : @xmath114 . the progenitor is found to have suffered large reddening and , correspondingly , had a high temperature .",
    "our method for determining the masses of the progenitors is different to those previously used , in particular the technique adopted by @xcite .",

    "even though we have established the stability of observing under photometric conditions with gemini gmos , over the period in which the late - time observations were conducted , the lack of photometric standards observed on the same night as late - time @xmath47 and @xmath50 observations raises some concern about the size of the uncertainties estimated for these two measurements .",

    "we note that the parameters of the progenitor , as constrained by the @xcite dataset , do not completely resolve the degeneracy between temperature and reddening , as indicated by the barely closed contours on figure [ fig : disc : other ] , although they favour the high temperature solution found in our analysis .    in their original analysis",

    "it is clear from our analysis of the progenitor of sn  2008bk , with the expanded dataset , that @xmath123 photometric points are required to adequately constrain the progenitor sed and break the degeneracies between temperature and reddening .",
    "the analysis by @xcite suggested a low reddening towards the progenitor , however our reanalysis , despite using the same synthetic spectra , suggests a different picture .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : disc : other ] , for their photometry , that the bulk of the probability in the reddening / temperature plane lies at negative reddening ( driven by the @xmath47 measurement ) .",
    "the apparent need for negative reddening to provide an adequate fit to the theoretical seds may suggest : 1 ) the models are incompatible with the observed data or 2 ) the data are incompatible with the theoretical models ( based on our photometry , we favour the latter ) .",

    "3 ) , which are all significantly cooler than the temperature we measure here .",
    "our inferred temperature agrees with the temperature - colour relation presented by @xcite , where for the progenitor of sn  2008bk we find @xmath126 . following the spectral type sequence of @xcite , the progenitor of sn  2008bk",
    "would be considered to have spectral type k1 ; significantly earlier than the canonical prediction of m - supergiants as the progenitors of type iip sne , and just as hot as the progenitor of the type iib sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "an important concern , therefore , is that either the marcs seds yield solutions that are too hot or stellar evolution models underestimate the temperature of the progenitors .",
    "we note , however , that the intrinsic colours for the progenitor ( for the best fit solution ) are also consistent with the colour sequence of @xcite ; and , following their spectral type sequence , we again find the progenitor is consistent with an early k - supergiant .",
    "while our result is dependent on marcs seds , we note that @xcite derived a similar mass but using the basel standard stellar library .",
    "conversely , the temperatures predicted by stellar evolution models may be `` tuned '' through the assumptions of different opacities and mixing lengths .",
    "@xcite recently compared temperature estimates for rsgs derived using sed fitting techniques ( similar to those used here ) and the strengths of the tio bands .",
    "@xcite found that temperatures determined from the strength of the tio bands are generally lower ( @xmath127 ) than those derived from ir photometry ; and , furthermore , the strength of the tio bands were observed to be correlated with the luminosity of the rsg . in light of the new analysis by @xcite ,",
    "we find that the temperature for the progenitor of sn  2008bk is not unusual . in previous analyses , with single detections or upper limits",
    ", we have had to assume the temperature / spectral type of a cool rsg(see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; such that if the temperatures were underestimated , the corresponding bolometric luminosities were overestimated ( making the rsg problem even worse ) .",
    "our recent reanalysis of the pre - explosion observations of the progenitors of sne 2003gd and 2005cs have , similarly , resulted in hotter temperature constraints ( in the similar temperature range as the progenitor of sn 2008bk ; @xcite ) .      based on the cool temperatures originally assumed for the progenitors of sne 2005cs @xcite and 2008bk @xcite ( and the properties of the subsequent sne ) , @xcite suggested the progenitors may have been super asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) stars exploding as `` electron capture '' sne @xcite , rather than due to the collapse of an iron core .",
    "our revised temperature for the progenitor of sn  2008bk clearly rules it out as being an sagb star ; and the new initial mass estimate suggests the progenitor was capable of producing an fe - core at the end of its life .",
    "the progenitor mass provides a key test of hydrodynamical models of sn evolution ( specifically the behaviour of the light curve ) . for sn",
    "2005cs there was a clear discrepancy between the progenitor mass determined from pre - explosion observations ( @xmath128 * ? ? ?",

    "2008bk might go some way to resolve the discrepancy between the our progenitor masses and the hydrodynamical masses .",
    "similarly , the revised mass estimate for this progenitor may suggest previous mass estimates for the progenitors of other type iip sne have been underestimated .",
    "this may have contributed to the rsg problem @xcite ; however if the small increase in mass we have found for the progenitor of sn  2008bk were equally applicable to all progenitors , it would not completely eliminate the rsg problem . although sn  2008bk was identified as a low - luminosity ( low velocity , low ni mass ) type iip sn ,",
    "the mass we derive for the progenitor is higher than previously determined for the progenitor of the similar sn  2005cs@xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed the nebular spectrum of sn  2008bk , and showed that the observed line fluxes were consistent with a model spectrum arising from a @xmath130 progenitor , matching the result found here using pre - explosion observations . recently , showed these line fluxes , in particular @xmath131 $ ] , could be used to establish the progenitor mass to within @xmath132 .",

    "the large reddenings inferred to nearby hii regions and the observation of a significant light echo in hst observations @xcite , may suggest that the bulk of the reddening affecting the progenitor of sn  2008bk was in the ism and not local to the star itself .",
    "the large amount of dust affecting the sed of the progenitor of sn  2008bk is , however , in conflict with the low reddening derived from the observations of sn 2008bk itself , in the analysis of @xcite ; and is higher than estimated by @xcite for their low mass solution .",
    "although dust has been suggested as a possible explanation for the rsg problem @xcite , our analysis of the progenitor of sn  2008bk ( and previous findings @xcite ) have not indicated that any csm dust affecting the progenitors of type iip sne have a different composition or reddening law compared to the ism dust . while @xcite suggested silicate or graphite dust might explain the observed sed of the progenitor of sn  2012aw , the available data for that progenitor is insufficient to rule out ordinary ism dust .",
