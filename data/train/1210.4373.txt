    "after leaving the main sequence , stars of low and intermediate mass travel across the hertzsprung - russell diagram and reach the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . during this phase ,",
    "the star ejects matter at a very high rate ( up to 10@xmath0 solar masses per year ) in form of a slow ( 5 to 30  ) , dense , isotropic wind .",
    "the resulting circumstellar envelope often exhibits maser emission from several molecules , the most common being sio , h@xmath1o and oh . these masers arise at different distances from the star from different layers in the envelope , tracing different physical and chemical conditions .",
    "sio masers are found close to the star ( few stellar radii ) , then the water maser are a little farther ( a few hundreds of stellar radii ) and farther out , the oh masers ( at a few thousands of stellar radii ) see @xcite .",
    "as the star follows its evolution to the planetary nebulae ( pn ) phase , mass - loss stops and the envelope begins to ionized , such that the masers emission disappear progressively .",
    "the sio masers are supposed to disappear first , the h@xmath1o masers may survive a few hundreds of years and oh masers remain for a period of @xmath21000 years and can even be found in pne phase .",
    "the evolution of the envelopes around agb stars toward pne , through the phase of proto planetary nebulae ( ppne ) is yet poorly know , in particular the shaping of pne .",
    "while during the agb phase the star exhibits roughly spherical symmetry , about 10000 years later , pne are often asymmetrical ( about 75% see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* manchado 2000 ) ) showing axial symmetry , including multi - polar or elliptical symmetry , and very collimated and fast jets .",
    "bipolarity appears very early in the post - agb or ppn stage evolution .",
    "@xcite surveyed young pne with the hubble space telescope and found that most of them were characterized by multi polar morphology with collimated radial structures , and bright equatorial structures indicating the presence of jets and disks / tori in some objects .",
    "they propose that during the late agb or early ppn stages the high - speed collimated outflows carve out an imprint in the spherical agb wind , which provides the morphological signature for the development of asymmetric pne .",
    "the mechanism explaining how axial symmetry appears during this evolutionary phase is still an open question .",
    "several models have been proposed , that in general involve the interaction of very fast and collimated flows , ejected by means of magneto - centrifugal launching , with the agb fossil shell .",
    "interferometric observations of maser emission in such sources allow us to get access to the formation and evolution of these jets and with a very high spatial resolution .",
    "this review will report meanly on recent results published since the previous iau 242 maser symposium , held in alice springs in 2007 .",
    "during the last years , several surveys have been conducted to discover new maser emission toward post - agb objects .",

    "they observed a list of 85 sources in total ( 11 of them in sio ) , selected on the basis of their oh 1612  mhz spectra , and get 21 detections ( 3 in sio ) , out of which 5 sources present high velocity profiles and one source show a wide double peak profile of the sio maser .",

    "they detected two sources at 6035 mhz ( 5 cm ) , both of them young ( or very young ) pne .",
    "and very recently , @xcite , conducted a sensitive survey with the effelsberg antenna of water maser emission toward 74 post - agbs , and found 6 new water fountain candidates showing a double peak profile .",
    "in the class of the proto - planetary nebulae , there is a very interesting sub - class of young ppne called the water fountains .",
    "they present both hydroxyl and water maser emission , however their characteristics differ from those typical of agb starso maser spectra present a velocity range within the oh maser one and their profiles are more irregular . ] .",
    "first of all , h@xmath1o and oh maser spectra exhibit a double peaked profile with the peaks symmetrically distributed about the star velocity .",
    "but , unlike in agb stars , h@xmath1o maser are spread over a larger velocity range than the oh masers ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* imai  2008 ) for example ) and higher velocity ( up to 400   see figure [ fig2 ] ) than oh maser velocity or agb radial expansion wind ( 10 - 20   ( * ? ? ? * te lintel  1989 ) ) .",
    "high spatial resolution observations of the water masers emission in these objects reveals bipolar distribution and highly collimated outflows ( hence the name of water fountain ) .",
    "the first member of this subclass of ppn , w  43a , was first observed by @xcite with the vlba , and showed a well collimated and precessing jet with an outflow velocity of @xmath2145  .",

    "the most recent source confirmed to belong to this sub - class is iras 18113 - 2503 ( ( * ? ? ? * gmez  2011 ) , see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the source shows the typical double peak spectra , with a very large velocity dispersion and the peaks of water emission are separated by about 500   ( from -150 to + 350   lsr ) .",
    "it is likely to be the fastest outflows observed up to now with a velocity of at least 250  .",
    "the e - vla map clearly shows a bipolar spatial distribution with a blueshifted part to the north and a redshited lobe to the south .",
    "+ iras 19067 + 0811 is also an interesting source , observations in 1988 clearly detected a double peak h@xmath1o spectrum covering a velocity range of twice of the velocity range of the oh spectra , but @xcite only detected oh maser emission . and finally , i would like to mention iras 15103 - 5754 a very peculiar source as it is the first confirmed water fountain that is not a ppn but a pn ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* surez  2009 ) and these proceedings ) .",
    "a careful analysis of the 3d structure of jets ( including proper motions studies ) is a fundamental element for the development of theoretical models of the pn shaping mechanisms and of the nature of the outflows that give rise to the complex structure found in many ppne and pne .    in w  43a ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* imai  2002 , 2005 ) ) .",
    "the proper motion analysis also demonstrates that the jets exhibit a spiral pattern and is precessing with a period of 55 years . in the source iras  16342 - 3814 ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* claussen 2009 ) and these proceedings ) found that water masers lie on opposite sides of the optical nebula and their distribution is generally tangential to the inferred jet axis .",
    "proper - motion measurements give a velocity of the jet at the position of the extreme velocity maser components of at least 155 to 180   but no direct evidence for precession was found , maser features appear to follow a purely radial motion ( no curve trajectories are observed ) .",
    "a detailed morpho - kinematical structure analysis of the h@xmath1o masers from the water fountain iras 18286 - 0959 has been carried on by @xcite ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "observations are best interpreted by a model with two precessing jets ( or `` double helix '' outflow pattern ) with velocities of up to 138   and a precessing period of less than 60 years .",
    "this proper motion studies allow also to estimate other parameters like the dynamical age of these outflows and they are found to be surprisingly young , of the order of few tens of years , up to 150 years , which suggests that the evolutionary stage that these water - fountain sources represent is likely to be very short : 50 years for w  43a ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "vlbi astrometry of h@xmath1o masers also allow to derive more accurate distance of these sources .",

    "* chevalier & luo 1994 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* garca - segura  1999 ) ) have shown that the magnetic field could be a dominant factor in jet collimation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blackman  2001 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* garca - segura  2005 ) ) in post - agb stars .",
    "the zeeman effect produces a shift in frequency between the two circular polarizations ( lcp and rcp ) that is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field ( projected on the line of sight ) .",
    "hence , by measuring this shift , we can deduce the value of the magnetic field .",
    "several molecules giving rise to maser emission are sensible to this effect ( like oh and h@xmath1o ) , and then provide a unique tool for studying the role of the magnetic field in the jet collimation ( of water fountains for example ) .",
