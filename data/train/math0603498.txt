    "lagrangian fibrations arise naturally from integrable systems .",
    "it is a standard fact of hamiltonian mechanics that such fibrations are locally given by maps of the type : @xmath1 where the function components of @xmath2 are poisson commuting functions on a symplectic manifold and such that the differentials @xmath3 are pointwise linearly independent almost everywhere .",
    "it is customary to assume @xmath2 to be @xmath4 differentiable ( smooth ) . under this regularity assumption ,",
    "a classical theorem of arnold - liouville says that a smooth proper lagrangian submersion with connected fibres has locally the structure of a trivial lagrangian @xmath5-bundle .",
    "in particular , all proper lagrangian submersions are locally modelled on @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a contractible open set and @xmath6 has the standard symplectic form induced from @xmath8 .",
    "standard coordinates with values in @xmath6 are known as action - angle coordinates . since these are defined on a fibred neighbourhood , action - angle coordinates are _ semi - global _ canonical coordinates .",
    "thus proper lagrangian submersions have no semi - global symplectic invariants .    in this article",
    "we investigate the semi - global symplectic topology of proper lagrangian fibrations given by piecewise smooth maps . in @xcite6",
    "we introduced the notion of _ stitched lagrangian fibration_. these are continuous proper @xmath9 invariant fibrations of smooth symplectic manifolds @xmath10 which fail to be smooth only along the zero level set @xmath11 of the moment map of the @xmath9 action and whose fibres are all smooth lagrangian @xmath12-tori .",
    "essentially , these fibrations consist of two honest smooth pieces @xmath13 and @xmath14 , stitched together along @xmath15 , which we call the _ seam_. these fibrations , roughly speaking , can be expressed locally as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are smooth functions defined on @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , whose differentials do not necessarily coincide along @xmath15 .",
    "fibrations of this type are implicit in the examples proposed earlier by the authors @xcite5 and may also be implicit in those in @xcite . in this paper , we develop a theory of action - angle coordinates for this class of piecewise smooth fibrations .",
    "contrary to what happens in the smooth case , we found that these fibrations do give rise to semi - global symplectic invariants .",
    "to the authors knowledge , the kind of non - smoothness we investigate here does not seem to be of relevance to hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "nevertheless it is an important issue in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry . over the past ten years",
    ", lagrangian torus fibrations , in particular those which are _ special lagrangian _ , have been discovered to play a fundamental role in mirror symmetry @xcite .",
    "one should expect mirror pairs of calabi - yau manifolds to be fibred by lagrangian tori and the mirror relation to be expressed in terms of a legendre transform between the corresponding affine bases @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this approach to mirror symmetry has some intricacies .",
    "for instance , there are examples of ( non proper ) special lagrangian fibrations which are not given by smooth maps .",
    "actually , one should expect a generic special lagrangian fibration to be piecewise smooth @xcite .",
    "non - smoothness may also arise even in the purely lagrangian case .",
    "in fact , there are examples of lagrangian torus fibrations of calabi - yau manifolds which are piecewise smooth @xcite .",
    "this lack of regularity has two important consequences . in first place ,",
    "the discriminant locus of the fibration i.e .",
    "the set of points in the base corresponding to singular fibres may have codimension less than 2 .",
    "secondly , the base of the fibration may no longer carry the structure of an integral affine manifold away from the discriminant locus .",
    "in fact , the affine structure may break off not only along the discriminant as it normally occurs in the smooth case but also along a larger set containing the discriminant . under these circumstances",
    ", it may become problematic to interpret the syz duality as a legendre transform between affine manifolds .",
    "one should therefore understand the symplectic topology of piecewise smooth lagrangian fibrations .",
    "some of the piecewise smooth examples here actually resemble the singular behaviour expected to appear in generic special lagrangian fibrations .",
    "what is more important for our purposes , however , is the fact that our lagrangian models coincide topologically with the non - lagrangian models used by gross @xcite ; the discriminant locus in our case may jump to codimension 1 in some regions but the total spaces are the same . in some cases ,",
    "the discriminant has the shape of a planar amoeba @xmath21 ( see figure  [ fig : amoeba ] ) and fails to be smooth over the hyperplane @xmath22 containing @xmath21 .",
    "away from @xmath21 these fibrations are stitched lagrangian torus fibrations . in particular , the affine structure on the base breaks apart along @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we provide some useful techniques to understand how this degeneration of the affine structure occurs .",
    "the material of this paper is organised as follows . in  [ section aa ] we start reviewing the classical theory of action - angle coordinates for smooth fibrations . in  [ sec : def - ex ] we recall the construction of piecewise smooth fibrations of @xcite , these are explicitly given examples , some of them with codimension 1 discriminant locus",
    ". then we revise the definition of stitched fibration , introduced in @xcite .",
    "we formalise the idea of action - angle coordinates for stitched fibrations , allowing us to define the first order invariant , @xmath24 , of a stitched fibration .",
    "this invariant measures the discrepancy along @xmath15 between the distributions spanned by the hamiltonian vector fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the seam @xmath15 is an @xmath9-bundle @xmath29 such that : @xmath30_{f|_z } \\ar[rr]^{p } &   & \\bar{z } \\ar[dl]^{\\bar{f } } \\\\ &   \\gamma } \\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the reduced fibration over the wall @xmath32 , with tangent @xmath33-plane distribution : @xmath34 let @xmath35 be the set of fibrewise closed sections of @xmath36 , i.e. elements in @xmath35 can be viewed as closed 1-forms on the fibres of @xmath31 .",
    "the first order invariant of @xmath2 is defined as follows .",
    "there are smooth @xmath9-invariant functions @xmath37 on @xmath15 such that @xmath38 . in particular , this implies that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are mapped under @xmath41 to the same vector field @xmath42 on @xmath43 .",

    "this result extends arnold - liouville s theorem to this piecewise smooth setting . in  [ sec .",
    "stitch w / mono ] we study stitched fibrations over non simply connected bases .",
    "we show that one can read the monodromy of a stitched fibration as a jump of the cohomology class @xmath59 $ ] as @xmath60 traverses a component of the discriminant locus .    in the last section , we propose the following :    * conjecture .",
    "* let @xmath61 be a smooth algebraic hypersurface , @xmath62 be the map defined by : @xmath63 then there is a piecewise smooth lagrangian @xmath12-torus fibration with discriminant locus being the amoeba @xmath64 inside @xmath65 . away from @xmath21",
    "these fibrations are stitched lagrangian fibrations .    to support this conjecture",
    "we propose a construction .",
    "the results of this article allow us to have good control on the regularity of a large class of proper lagrangian fibrations . using simple techniques",
    ", one may deform the invariants of a given stitched fibration and produce proper lagrangian fibrations with @xmath9 symmetry which are smooth on prescribed regions .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by multiplying a given sequence of invariants by a smooth function on the base @xmath66 vanishing on a prescribed region . in joint work in progress",

    "we review the classical theory of action - angle coordinates for @xmath4 lagrangian fibrations . for the details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "assume we are given a @xmath67-dimensional symplectic manifold @xmath10 with symplectic structure @xmath68 , a smooth @xmath12-dimensional manifold @xmath66 and a proper submersion @xmath69 whose fibres are connected lagrangian submanifolds .",

    "we believe that the more general construction proposed in this section is interesting because , if it can be carried through , then these lagrangian fibrations could be used as building blocks of more general lagrangian fibrations of compact symplectic manifolds .",
    "we give here a proof of lemma [ ls : form ] for all @xmath1174 .",
    "recall we can write @xmath1175 the @xmath107 s are functions of @xmath600 , with @xmath601 , satisfying @xmath1176 when @xmath272 is sufficiently small and @xmath575 , the functions @xmath603 s can be uniquely determined using the implicit function theorem .",
    "we will now use it to compute the @xmath603 s and obtain formulae ( [ ls : rec ] ) .",
    "we can rewrite the second equation of the above system by applying @xmath1177 we obtain @xmath1178 which implies @xmath1179 to express everything as a power series in @xmath485 we use the taylor expansion up to a certain order @xmath1180 of the @xmath546 s , which in the multi - index notation is given by : @xmath1181 where @xmath1182 is a multi - index and the @xmath1183 s are suitable constants .",
    "let us introduce the following notation .",
    "for every multi - index @xmath1184 , let us define the following set @xmath1185 when @xmath1186 , we also write @xmath1187 . for every @xmath547 ,",
    "we denote @xmath1188 clearly if @xmath1189 and @xmath1190 or if @xmath1191 then @xmath1192 is empty .",
    "when @xmath1193 for all @xmath1194 , substituting ( [ agei : tay ] ) we compute that @xmath1195    let us introduce another bit of notation . when @xmath1196 , for all @xmath1197 , let @xmath1198 when @xmath1199 , the only element in @xmath1200 is @xmath1201 , so we set @xmath1202 thus for all multi - indices @xmath1203 , we have @xmath1204 therefore @xmath1205 written as a power series in @xmath485 becomes @xmath1206 substituting this into ( [ aj : bla ] ) we obtain @xmath1207 substituting also ( [ aj : tay_again ] ) we have @xmath1208 therefore , for every @xmath1209 , we have @xmath1210 when @xmath1211 , this becomes @xmath1212 when @xmath1213 it can also be written as @xmath1214 now notice that when @xmath1215 and @xmath1216 , then @xmath1217 only depends on the @xmath667 s with @xmath1218 . therefore if we define @xmath1219 when @xmath1213 and @xmath597 , then ( [ ls : rec ] ) holds with @xmath592 satisfying the required properties .                            m.  kontsevich and y.  soibelman .",

    "<S> we study certain types of piecewise smooth lagrangian fibrations of smooth symplectic manifolds , which we call _ stitched lagrangian fibrations_. we extend the classical theory of action - angle coordinates to these fibrations by encoding the information on the non - smoothness into certain invariants consisting , roughly , of a sequence of closed @xmath0-forms on a torus . the main motivation for this work is given by the piecewise smooth lagrangian fibrations previously constructed by the authors @xcite , which topologically coincide with the local models used by gross in topological mirror symmetry @xcite . </S>"
