    "the detailed knowledge of atomic and molecular populations is essential to analyze and evaluate accurately thermodynamic properties and chemical processes in fluids as well as their monochromatic opacities . in particular , they are required in studies of stellar interiors , atmospheres and circumstellar envelopes .",
    "gas densities in stellar atmospheres and circumstellar structures are low , they are hardly higher than 0.001 g@xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , in these cases it is necessary to deal with a high variety of particles and electronic configurations and therefore , with a series of physical processes to calculate the radiation emitted by the star accurately @xcite .    among the most difficult challenges in determining gas models is to obtain self - consistently atomic densities and opacity absorption coefficients by taking into account the non - ideal effects .",
    "the source of non - ideal effects is the presence of coulombic interactions between charged particles as well as due to the short - ranged interactions between neutral - neutral and neutral - charged particles . due to its relevance and complexity",
    ", the elaboration of gas models from mechanical statistical approaches is still an active area of research today @xcite .",
    "the present study is motivated by the difficulties of predicting quantitatively the optical properties of stellar atmospheres . in typical gas models",
    "the opacity data are obtained through a complimentary calculation once the equations of state and mean abundances of bound states are obtained .",
    "this procedure can produce , however , internal inconsistencies in a model , mainly when the abundances of atoms are calculated using internal energies that are different from those assumed to obtain the radiative transitions @xcite .",
    "this can lead to serious disagreements between predictions and observations or experiments ( e.g. , the unphysical lyman opacity @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to develop a theoretical formalism that treats atoms subjected to different perturbations by considering them in separate groups and evaluate accordingly the populations and opacities in a consistent way .",
    "such a gas model has then to consider explicitly not only all atomic excited states but also do they need to discriminate different perturbation states with the use of an appropriate particle - state variable .",
    "our work is then oriented to develop a model with these characteristics .    with the aim of establishing a detailed and accurate equation of state for fluids , in a previous work we have developed a gas statistical formalism which combines free energy minimization methods with space partitions @xcite .",
    "the novel feature of this formalism , as compared to other more standard and well - established statistical - mechanical theories of the fluid / liquid state , is the attempt of keeping trace , in a thermodynamically self - consistent way , of a more refined structural information on the local environment of a given particle through an extra parameter , the `` available volume '' , which is determined by the distance of the reference particle to its closest neighbor . for noninteracting particles",
    ", the available volume `` @xmath2 '' is equivalent to the spherical volume whose radius is the distance between the respective centers of the particle and its nearest neighbor .",
    "this volume is considerably smaller for particles with repulsive interactions .",
    "the theory @xcite was formulated for one - component dilute fluids , where the helmholtz free energy is written in terms of the occupation number distribution @xmath9 of the @xmath2-variable and where the particle interactions are introduced using pair potentials .",
    "the result thus obtained represents a unified treatment of thermodynamics and the structure of fluids .",
    "the formulation was applied to hydrogen atoms in an electrically neutral medium of charged particles encompassing ions and electrons .",
    "the atomic populations were derived by establishing groups of atoms having different plasma perturbations measured according to the size of their available space volumes @xmath2 .",
    "although the results obtained are only illustrative of its possible performances , this theory represents the first attempt of evaluating in detail the populations by combining consistently the plasma interaction effects .",
    "approaches based on space partitions were attempted in the past with the so - called  cell \" theories to obtain equations of state for fluids . however , the character of these space divisions is quite different as compared to that employed in @xcite and in the present paper .",
    "the cell models @xcite were originally developed by eyring and hirschfelder @xcite and by lennard - jones and devonshire @xcite .",
    "they were inspired by the lattice - like configurations acquired by some systems at high densities . in such theories",
    "the fluid volume is divided into an imaginary lattice of cells . each particle",
    "is then confined into a cell , which implies that a space partition is assumed beforehand , instead of being deduced from the model proper . besides , by ignoring the interchange of particles between cells , an error is introduced in the system - entropy calculation , which is usually corrected using an arbitrary `` communal entropy '' factor .",
    "the perspective of the theory presented in @xcite is new , as it determines a space division by assigning the @xmath2-volume to the particles .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing the system free energy under the condition that the sum of all @xmath2-volumes be equivalent to the entire volume of the fluid . in this procedure ,",
    "no particle confinement is established , because the assignment of an individual volume to each particle does not introduce any ownership connection between space regions and particles , i.e. , @xmath2 does not carry any information on the particle coordinates .",
    "therefore , the formulation presented in @xcite is free from difficulties that are inherent to the cell theories , i.e. entropy corrections , and it can provide new results , such as the combined thermodynamical and structural information of a fluid , which can not be derived from the cell models .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize the formalism to @xmath0-dimensional multi - component fluids that was initially developed in @xcite only for pure or single - component substances .",
    "it aims at giving particularly simple analytic forms to provide a unified derivation of thermodynamic and geometric properties that characterize them .",
    "the formulation of the theory is general , but attention is focused on its application to hard sphere models , which represent the repulsive interactions among atoms and geometrically simple molecules @xcite .",
    "we also include the analysis of hard spheres with weak long - range attraction ( kc type ) and hard spheres with square - well potential",
    ". the approximations discussed here should be suitable for more realistic short - ranged potentials , like those governing many atomic and colloidal fluids .",
    "our introduction of space partitions in statistical thermodynamics marks a considerable progress in the description of gases with respect to previous theories , since it gives the possibility of obtaining thermodynamic and structural information on fluids simultaneously and self - consistently .",
    "the present extension to multicomponent fluids enables us to treat arbitrarily complex chemical mixtures by including systematically the inter - particle interaction potentials .",
    "the theory can have many applications , not only in astrophysics , but also in other fields such as the analysis of colloidal and protein solutions in biochemistry .    in the following sections , we first introduce a description of states of a gas mixture based on space partitions .",
    "general expressions for the helmholtz free energy are presented in sect .",
    "[ s.helm ] and the thermodynamic equilibrium states are derived in sect .",
    "[ s.equ_sta ] .",
    "we analyze there some non - conventional thermodynamic variables that are generated by the theory and derive general expressions to calculate chemical potentials .",
    "then , applications of the formalism to a few multi - component systems based on hard particles with and without attractive forces are given in sect .",
    "[ s.hard ] .",
    "the results obtained are compared with those from percus - yevick and scale particle theories . in sect .",
    "[ s.chem ] we extend the theory to include chemical reactions in the gas .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "[ s.concl ] .",
    "the approach developed here is inspired by the variety of spatial patterns shown by fluids where the particles have different types of interactions .",
    "the main assumption that will be made is that the spatial structure of a gas in equilibrium can be described by an appropriate division of the space among the particles .",
    "the study of single - component fluids at low densities @xcite has shown that the volume @xmath2 assigned to a particle depends on the interactions the particle has with the closest neighbor . in sect .",
    "[ s.hard ] we give a formal definition of the closest neighbor .",
    "according to the mentioned result , the generalization of the formalism to multi - component fluid systems ( mixtures ) , requires that the particle population @xmath10 of each chemical species @xmath5 be divided into sub - groups or sub - classes in accordance with the chemical species of the nearest neighbor , i.e. @xmath11 where the sub - indices 1,2,3 ... specify the various chemical species of the closest neighbors .",
    "we consider that for any reference particle in whatever configuration of @xmath12 particles , there is ` one and only one ' @xmath13th neighbor , with @xmath14 .",
    "this means that if there is degeneracy where two particles can be equidistant from the reference , one of them will be designated as the @xmath13th neighbor arbitrarily , while the other will be the @xmath15th neighbor . in what follows we shall use the sub - index @xmath16 for a particle of class @xmath5 that has individual available volume @xmath2 , whose nearest neighbor is of class @xmath6 .",
    "the state of the gas will then be described by the following collections : @xmath17 \\hspace{.3 in } ( 0\\le v\\le v),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the number of particles @xmath16 with available individual volumes ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath19 .",
    "the physically acceptable states in ( [ e.state ] ) must obey the particle number @xmath4 and gas volume @xmath20 conservation conditions given  by @xmath21 @xmath22 thus , the individual volume @xmath2 assigned to each particle acts as an attribute inherent to each particle and the sum of @xmath2-spaces is equivalent to the entire volume of the gas .",
    "this space partition does not involve any knowledge of particle positions , since the assignment of a @xmath2-volume to each particle does not carry any information on the particle coordinates .",
    "to evaluate the free energy of the gas we use a composition of translation- , configuration- and interaction - dependent terms : @xmath23 which is suitable for a large variety of fluids @xcite .",
    "the first two contributions to @xmath24 can be written respectively as : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath29 is the temperature and @xmath30 is the thermal wavelength of particles of class @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath31 was obtained following the steps described in @xcite , except that in the present case was done for a gas - mixture . for the multi - component system",
    "we have then that the total number of ways @xmath32 to generate a set @xmath33 of occupation numbers from the individual complexions @xmath34 is @xmath35 , where : @xmath36 therefore , according to @xcite the configuration entropy is : @xmath37 which finally determines ( [ e.fconf ] ) , since @xmath38 .",

    "the minimizing procedure must take into account that the variations @xmath49 affect the total particle populations of each species according to the relation : @xmath50 we thus obtain for the state of equilibrium : @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ e.nv ] ) , @xmath3 and @xmath54 are the lagrange multipliers corresponding to conditions ( [ e.nil ] ) and ( [ e.vcons ] ) respectively . accordingly , the potentials @xmath3 determine the total population of particles @xmath5 and their redistribution into sub - sets as a function of the nearest neighbor class .",
    "the variable @xmath54 determines the distribution of individual available volumes @xmath2 .",
    "it is useful to note that the total interaction energy can also be written as @xmath55 which enable us to see that @xmath56 is the average energy due to all interactions the particle of class @xmath5 has with the gas , while @xmath57 represents the interaction energy of the @xmath16 particle with the gas . finally , using ( [ e.nv ] ) and",

    "the chemical potential corresponding to @xmath62class particles is : @xmath63 the substitution of ( [ e.fequil ] ) into ( [ e.mui ] ) and the use of relation ( [ a.ide3 ] ) lead to the following expression of @xmath7 in terms of potentials @xmath3 , @xmath64 in fluids with low enough density , it is expected that the splitting up of the @xmath10 populations into sub - groups @xmath4 [ eq . ( [ e.ni ] ) ] be determined by the mole fractions @xmath65 of species present in the gas .",
    "this means that the population of particles @xmath5 having as closest neighbors the class @xmath6 particles is proportional to the total population of @xmath62particles and to the abundance of @xmath66class particles : @xmath67 we can also say that the probability of a particle had an @xmath66class as the closest neighbor is given simply by the abundance of @xmath6 species . in this case",

    "this is what happens in a mixture of ideal gases , as it is shown in what follows .",

    "the second right - hand term in ( [ e.milg ] ) and ( [ e.mui_a ] ) gives the contribution due to the potential energy acquired on average by an @xmath62class particle due to its interaction with all the remaining particles in the gas .",

    "we have foreseen some results that could be obtained with the present theory .",
    "for example , it is possible to show that atoms of a given species in a gas do not have all the same effective ionization potential ( electronic energy relative to the energy threshold corresponding to free electrons ) , but can they have a variety of values according to the available volume of particles .",
    "the application of the present theory to mixtures of atomic particles with more realistic interaction potentials than considered here will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have developed a mathematical framework in terms of a helmholtz free - energy model which aims at describing equilibrium properties of @xmath0-dimensional multi - component fluids .",
    "this theory is an extension of a former model devoted to one - component fluids and combines free - energy minimization methods with space partitions based on the available volume @xmath2 to a particle and the occupation number distributions of this variable .",
    "thus we obtain an unified formalism that treats thermodynamics and structure of complex fluids simultaneously .    the theory is presently developed for the case of dilute fluids , where inter - particle interactions are evaluated from pair potentials .",
    "two closure relations ( [ e.nilninl ] ) and ( [ e.vid ] ) are required to obtain a closed formalism .",
    "the former is associated to the particle number conservation ( [ e.nil ] ) and provides the probability that a particle had a specific species as the closest neighbor . the second closure relation ( [ e.vid ] )",
    "specifies the available - volume variable and , therefore , is linked to the filling space condition ( [ e.vcons ] ) .",
    "consequently , unconventional thermodynamic variables were derived by introducing space partitions in the thermo - statistical analysis of fluids .",
    "they are lagrange s multipliers related to the specific particle number and volume conservations , which describe thus chemical potentials and the pressure , respectively .",
    "in addition , we have obtained general expressions for the excess chemical potentials and chemical equilibrium conditions of non - ideal fluids , as well as several pair distribution functions .",
    "the theory provides a straightforward way to calculate thermodynamic quantities and structure properties of gas mixtures . as illustrative examples , we have considered several hard sphere systems for which simple analytical expressions were derived .",
    "the equations of state obtained for pure hard - sphere systems are in good agreement with the scaled - particle and percus - yevick solutions valid for low - densities .",
    "we reckon that this agreement confirms a posteriori the validity of the several approaches adopted . besides",
    ", well - known solutions for van der waals mixtures were recovered easily by using generalized kc potentials .",
    "we also have derived closed analytical forms for thermodynamic quantities of square - well mixture fluids .",
    "these evaluations constitute a reference for future studies of short ranged attractive systems .",
    "the influence of repulsive and attractive forces on the space partition among particles was analyzed .",
    "the results thus obtained express a close relationship between statistical geometry and statistical mechanics .",
    "the formalism introduced in the present work provide a useful tool to investigate the structure and the effective interactions in chemical complex fluids .",
    "it is particularly well suited to study some astrophysical gases where detailed descriptions of species and interactions are required .",
    "this occurs , in particular , in atmospheres and circumstellar envelopes , where the density can be hardly higher than some @xmath241 , so that the approximations for low densities given here can be used safely .",
    "we consider that present theory has other many applications in applied problems of current interest , such as studies of equilibrium properties of colloidal and protein solutions .    among the most important results obtained in this work",
    ", we can quote :    * a functional ( or series of functionals for mixing ) contains the entire thermodynamical information of the system and leads to a classification of particles according to their distance to the closest neighbor through the assignment of a given volume available to each particle .",
    "so , it is thus possible to distinguish the atoms according to the different degrees of perturbations carried by their neighbors . to our knowledge , there is no other model able to make this distinction up to now . *",
    "the current formalism is able to answer to the following inquiries : * * what is the probability of finding a particle of class @xmath13 at a distance @xmath167 from another particle of species @xmath5 whose closest neighbor is of class @xmath28 , knowing that @xmath167 , @xmath5 , @xmath13 and @xmath28 are arbitrary ? * * idem as before , but for a neighbor @xmath28 situated at a given ( arbitrary ) distance from the particle of class @xmath5 ? * the chemical equilibrium of a fluid and the classification of particles according to the distance to the respective closest neighbor , are done simultaneously and self - consistently with the laws of thermodynamics . *",
    "as far as we know , it is the first time that a theory is able to provide thermodynamical variables associated with the distribution of the space between the particles of different chemical species directly .",
    "the variables are related to the conventional thermodynamical variables explicitly , such as pressure , chemical potential , etc .",
    "the description level attained by our formalism overrides whatever known pre - existing model and constitutes an unparalleled tool to represent chemical mixing at low densities .",
