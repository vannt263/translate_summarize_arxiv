    "the use of highly resistive material for kinetic inductance detectors is promising because it is expected to increase their responsivity through the high kinetic inductance l@xmath4 and allow a more efficient direct optical coupling @xcite . to make kids based on highly resistive materials",
    ", one needs to adapt the microwave design typically used for aluminium kids .",
    "a kid chip consists essentially of multiple resonators coupled to a microwave throughline , which is connected to the readout electronics .",
    "the throughline has a characteristic impedance @xmath5 which must match the 50 @xmath0 impedance of the readout circuit : a mismatch is expected to be at the origin of losses in the transmission and box resonances at the origin of parasitic dips .",
    "@xmath5 depends in part on the surface inductance l@xmath4 , which is related to the resistivity @xmath6 of the metallic film .",
    "a 100 nm thick al film has typically l@xmath7 0.1 ph , whereas l@xmath8 44 ph for the tin film used in this study .",
    "the @xmath5 variations due to the increase of l@xmath4 can be determined using sonnet electromagnetic 2d simulations . for a typical throughline on silicone substrate having a central line width s = 10 @xmath9 and a gap width w = 6 @xmath9 , @xmath5 @xmath10 @xmath0 for al , whereas for l@xmath4 = 40 ph , @xmath5 becomes frequency dependent , with a mean value at @xmath11 180 @xmath0 .    to solve the problem of impedance mismatch",
    ", we have tested the option of an hybrid design , with a throughline in aluminum to read the tin resonators .",
    "two slightly different designs have been made and measured : the transmission obtained is close to the lossless transmission.the dark kid properties have been studied on a large number of resonators and the best nep measured is as low as @xmath12 @xmath1 @xmath13 .",
    "the three designs used for this study are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : design ] .",
    "the first design , mono , is a standard non hybrid design and has been measured for comparison to see experimentally the effect of an impedance mismatch .",
    "the second design is essentially made of aluminium , with only the kid central lines in tin .",
    "it is called kidmix because the resonators corresponds to a microwave tin line having an al groundplane . with this design",
    ", the kid properties may be affected by the presence of aluminium , especially if the superconducting critical temperature t@xmath14 of tin is larger than the al one .",
    "our al films have t@xmath14 = 1.2 k and tin has 0 k @xmath15 4.5 k depending on its stoichiometry .",
    "the third design , duo , has been made for future use of tin and other high resistive materials having @xmath16 1.2 k. it consists of an al throughline and tin resonators which are included in rectangular tin groundplanes .",
    "all designs have a 2 cm length straight throughline , with a central line s = 10 @xmath9 and a gap width w = 6 @xmath9 .",
    "the throughline is surrounded by 16 half waves meandered cpw resonators , having a 3 @xmath9 central line width , a 2 @xmath9 gap and a length between 3.1 and 4.5 mm .",
    "the length sets the resonance frequencies , which we want to be between 4 and 9 ghz to match with our setup specifications .",
    "it takes into account the geometrical inductance @xmath17 but also the frequency shift @xmath18 due to the kinetic inductance l@xmath4 .",
    "the resonators are capacitively coupled to the throughline via a t shaped coupler .",
    "the coupling length set the coupling quality factor @xmath19 of each resonator , which is related to the measured ( loaded ) quality factor q by the relation @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the internal quality factor @xmath21 is not known a priori so the coupling lengths are between 70 @xmath9 and 560 @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath22 between 6 @xmath1 @xmath23 and 3 @xmath1 @xmath24 .    in the duo design , the tin and al groundplanes are separated near the throughline by a gap , to avoid the presence of a possibly dirty interface close to the coupler , which might create some excess noise in the kid transmission @xcite .",
    "ideally , the al groundplane width on both sides of the throughline should be as large as its central line and gaps , to avoid any effect of the tin groundplanes on @xmath5 .",
    "but this implies a larger distance between throughline and resonators , thereby reducing @xmath22 . to minimize the effect of the tin groundplanes keeping the desired coupling ,",
    "the al groundplane width has been set at 4 @xmath9 near the resonators and the tin groundplanes have been reduced to rectangle of 700 @xmath9 width separated by 1300 @xmath9 al groundplanes .",
    "+ the 50 nm thick tin film has been produced by magnetron sputtering onto a highly resistive silicon substrate , with a @xmath25 flow rate of 3.58/30 and patterned using standard contact lithography and dry etching with an sf6/ar gasmixture .",
    "this is followed by deposition of a 100 nm al film which is patterned using wet etching .",
    "the tin film has been characterized by xps depth profiling and xrd : except on the top 1 nm layer , the film is contaminant free under the sensitivity of 0.5 at@xmath26 and the ( 111 ) and ( 200 ) crystallographic orientations are present , giving rise to diffraction peaks of similar amplitudes .",
    "resistivity measurements have been made at low temperature on 2 different chips : @xmath27 @xmath28 130 @xmath29 for both measurement but the superconducting transition has been seen at 0.8 k on the first chip and 1.1 k on the second . this discrepancy is unlikely due to the film quality according to the xps results and may come from the high t@xmath14 dependence of tin with nitrogen content , especially around t@xmath14 = 1 k. indeed , t@xmath14 = 1.5 k has been measured in another tin film from the same source and same quality , the only difference between the two films was a change of @xmath30 in the ratio of n2/ar flow rate used during the deposition .",
    "the chips used in this study were located , on the wafer , near the first chip having @xmath31= 0.8 k which will be used for the following analysis .",
    "the superconducting gap @xmath32 = 125 @xmath33 is determined from the relation @xmath32 = 1.81 k@xmath34t@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the kinetic inductance l@xmath4 @xmath11 44 ph is estimated using the relation l@xmath35 @xcite with t the film thickness .",
    "+ all chips have been measured with the same setup , during separate cooldowns .",
    "the chip measured is mounted on a sample holder cooled at 100 mk in an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator .",
    "the sample holder is placed in a light tight box @xcite , surrounded by a cryoperm and a superconducting magnetic shield .",
    "the complex transmission is measured using a commercial vector network analyzer , the noise is measured using an agilent synthetizer coupled to an iq mixer and the lifetime is obtained through the response to an optical pulse .",
    "more details on the setup and the measurements can be found ref @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the complex transmission @xmath36 measured for the three different designs , at 100 mk and with a readout power of -100 dbm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s21]a . between 4 and 9 ghz .",
    "only few sharp kid dips are visible due to the low frequency band resolution of the sweeps . the result of the same measurement on an aluminum chip is added as a reference for the setup transmission : @xmath36 is flat at 60 db , corresponding to the system transmission and decreases exponentially above 7 ghz due to one amplifier cutoff . @xcite .",
    "the mono chip exhibits an additional frequency dependent reduction of the transmission , up to 15 db around 7 ghz . on the other hand , the duo chip curve follow closely the lossless transmission .",
    "the kidmix chip is also close , but shows an unexpected 15 db reduction in the 7 to 8 ghz region .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : s21]b .",
    ", the @xmath36 transmission of the mono chip is presented at 100 mk and 500 mk . the s21 reduction due to",
    "the impedance mismatch is frequency dependent but also temperature dependent . for comparison ,",
    "the inset present the temperature dependence of the transmission , between 100 mk and 1.3k for the three chips at the fixed frequency 5 ghz . for the duo and kidmix chips ,",
    "the curve is dominated by the aluminum transmission : the superconducting transition appear at 1.25 k and @xmath36 is almost temperature independent below 800 mk . in the mono chip ,",
    "the tin superconducting transition is seen at 800 mk and the transmission depends on t even below 300 mk .",
    "the fact that the kidmix transmission is temperature independent shows that the reduction seen between 7 and 8 ghz is not due to the presence of tin .",
    "indeed , it has been identified in following experiments to be a parasitic setup reflection present during the measure of the kidmix chip : it has been cancelled by retightening one coaxial connector on the 4k stage .",
    "this results show that the throughline impedance match the 50 ohms circuit impedance for the duo and kidmix chips .",

    "have been detected ; the measured frequencies of all kids in all chips correspond to the fundamental and first harmonic of the geometric frequencies , shifted by a factor fexp / fg=0.2@xmath450.02 . in this study , 5 , 13 and 18 kid dips have been fully characterized in , respectively , the mono , duo and kidmix chips .    in the mono chip , almost all kid dips were asymmetric .",
    "this is probably another consequence of the impedance mismatch : the standing waves induce impedance variations near the kids coupling arms .",
    "it gives rise to an overestimation of the quality factors , but should nt affect the determination of the other properties .",
    "the mean and best values of the kid properties are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] for all kids of the three designs .",
    "they are varying slightly between kids on the same chip and we have not seen any clear systematic properties change between the three designs . the mean value for the internal quality factor @xmath21 is 1.8 @xmath1 @xmath42 , which agrees well with the values reported by vissers et al.@xcite on tin films having both ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) xrd peaks : our results then support their conclusions on the dependence of @xmath21 with crystalline orientation .",
    "the internal powers , calculated for the highest readout power ( typically -100dbm ) above which an excess noise due to current saturation is observed , are about 10 db lower than in the case of similar al kids having the same thickness .",
    "on the other hand , the lifetime measured at 100 mk varies widely from one kid to another , even in the same chip .",
    "half of the kids ( distributed on all the chips ) exhibit a lifetime between 0.2 and 0.3 ms , in good agreement with ref.@xcite , but a surprisingly long lifetime has been observed in some kids , up to 5.3ms at 100mk .",

    "[ fig : lifetime ] also shows the temperature dependence of the lifetime for kid @xmath46 and kid @xmath47 having the typical 0.2 ms lifetime at 100 mk .",

    "also , both temperature dependences do not follow the kaplan theory @xcite above this value .",
    "however , we believe that the relaxation time measured is the actual recombination time because 1 ) a careful optimization of the setup has been done to screen / absorb straylight and illuminate the superconducting film only [ jochem ltd14 ] , 2 ) with the same setup , we have measured on a low noise al kid , a lifetime from the pulse technique in good agreement with the one determined from the fluctuations in the noise spectra [ devissers prl10 ] , 3 ) as shown fig .
