    "a generic prediction of inflation in the early universe @xcite is the production of gravitational waves ( gw ) with a nearly flat spectrum @xcite .",
    "there are ongoing observational efforts to detect such a spectrum and recent , comprehensive reviews of past , present , and future experimental efforts can be found in refs .",
    "the dominant signature in the near term involves the effect that long - wavelength gravitational waves can have on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) through the generation of b - mode polarization ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude of the gravitational waves can be related to the energy scale at which inflation occurred , and the ratio of the power spectrum of gravitational waves to that of the scalar power spectrum , also known as the `` tensor - to - scalar ratio '' , @xmath4 , can give vital information into the nature of the inflaton  the field which drives inflation  via the lyth bound @xcite .",
    "additionally , primordial gravitational wave spectra produced by various non - inflationary mechanisms have been suggested @xcite .",
    "therefore any observation of a primordial gravitational wave spectrum would be an immensely powerful tool in the study of the very early universe .",
    "a question that naturally arises is - are there any effects that can intervene and alter the nature of the gw spectrum from the time of its production until the time of observation ?",
    "if the answer is yes , then one must account for such effects in order to accurately describe the primordial spectrum .",
    "as is well known , just such an intervening effect does arise due to the fact that an anisotropic stress from free streaming particles can damp the amplitude of gws from their primordial value .",
    "weinberg showed in @xcite that the damping effect of free - streaming neutrinos on the gw spectrum can be quite significant with up to 35.6% loss in amplitude , and following this work , the issue has been the subject of some attention @xcite .",
    "the original study of weinberg , and much of the following work has been focused on the effects of three massless neutrinos . however , recent cosmological observations have shown hints of deviations from the standard cosmological value of three effective neutrino degrees of freedom @xcite . due to neutrino oscillation experiments , it is also known that neutrinos are not massless , as described in a recent global analysis of neutrino properties @xcite ) .",
    "there are also some , albeit statistically insignificant presently , hints that the addition of extra neutrino species can improve fits to short baseline neutrino oscillation data @xcite .",
    "recently issues regarding light sterile neutrinos and cosmology have been addressed in @xcite .    prompted by these results",
    ", we broaden the scope by calculating gw damping in more general scenarios , including the effect of neutrino masses , additional ( beyond three ) massive and massless neutrino species , and extra _ bosonic _ degrees of freedom .",
    "( note that other recent work @xcite also touches on some of these issues related to extra degrees of freedom and gravitational waves . )",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    ", we first turn to the boltzmann equation , which determines the evolution of the phase space density of the particles , @xmath14 , given as a function of the four - momentum @xmath15 which has components @xmath16 .",
    "one can then determine the anisotropic stress by perturbing the distribution function about the background as @xmath17 , and employing the boltzmann equation @xmath18 .",
    "for the scenario of three massless neutrinos , the details of this calculation have been nicely presented in appendix d of @xcite , which explores the impact of collisionless damping .",
    "we will follow this treatment , but we will generalize to the case of massive particles with the number of degrees of freedom left as an input parameter .",
    "we will also examine the situation where a bosonic degree of freedom is incorporated , as well as the case of relativistic axions produced by axionic cosmic strings .",
    "these relativistic axions have a non - thermal spectrum .    for particles with a thermal distribution ,",
    "the background phase space density is given by @xmath19 where the plus sign is for fermions while the minus sign is for bosons , and @xmath20 gives the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for the two cases of interest in this work : @xmath21 for a single neutrino , and @xmath22 for a real scalar .",
    "@xmath23 is the temperature of neutrinos which is related to the photon temperature at times after neutrinos decoupling as @xmath24 .",
    "one begins with the relation @xmath25 we write this as @xmath26 where we have defined a new variable through a shift @xmath27      we follow the derivation in @xcite with this change ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the full neutrino distribution function satisfies the relativistic collisionless boltzmann equation , @xmath29    using the variable @xmath30 , one finds that to first order that eq .",

    "the covariant derivative is with respect to the unperturbed spatial frw metric .",

    "it can be seen to reduce to the standard form for three massless neutrinos when @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite . + from the relation eq .",
    "( [ stress ] ) , one can then include additional degrees of freedom by simply using @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) for four ( five ) massless neutrino species .",

    "in other words , the total anisotropic stress due to @xmath81 particles is given by the sum @xmath82 .",
    "+ to graphically display the effect of adding non - zero neutrino masses we adopt the simple analytic form for the scale factor @xmath83 in a matter plus radiation universe given by @xmath84 note that today , the relation between radiation and matter densities is given by @xmath85 for the standard cosmological scenario with @xmath86 , _",
    "i.e. _ , three effective neutrino degrees of freedom , we have @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 since the free - streaming neutrinos are relativistic .",
    "further it can be shown that @xcite + @xmath90 when adding extra neutrino species , we use the above relation and keep @xmath91 fixed but change the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ 43 ] ) accordingly to get a new redshift for matter - radiation equality @xcite .",
    "so , for @xmath92 and for @xmath93 .",
    "+ one sees that eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) is an integro - differential equation since the source term on the right - hand - side is the integral in eq .",
    "( [ stress ] ) . to put the equation into a suitable form for a numerical solution",
    ", we adopt the method in appendix a of @xcite , which consists of rewriting the single , second order integro - differential equation as a system of coupled first - order volterra type integro - differential equations .",
    "this can then be solved by standard methods of numerical integration @xcite .",
    "there is a slight difference in our method of solution from that in @xcite and @xcite due to the form of the integral kernel .",
    "namely , we do not have the simplifying option of integrating out the distribution function ( which would give the energy density in the standard case of massless neutrinos ) due to the additional @xmath94-dependence of other factors in the integrand .",
    "we therefore were forced to generate numerical values for the integrand at each value of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , after which the procedure of @xcite could be implemented .",
    "the fine tuning of @xmath97 can be avoided in models of particle physics that contain an extra @xmath98 peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry .",
    "a consequence of these models is a light pseudo - scalar particle , the axion . in a cosmological",
    "setting , the axion is massless above the qcd temperature but gains a small mass below this temperature . even though the axion is very light , with a typical mass @xmath99",
    ", it can be non - relativistic because it is produced coherently throughout the cosmological horizon and has momenta given by @xmath100 at cosmic time @xmath101 .",
    "this argument , however , ignores the topology that accompanies the breaking of the pq symmetry , which is relevant if the pq symmetry breaking scale occurs below the scale of inflation . in this case",
    ", the spontaneous breaking of the pq symmetry leads to the production of axionic cosmic strings with energy density set by the pq energy scale . as the strings oscillate , they radiate relativistic axions . at the qcd temperature scale ,",
    "the strings get connected by axionic domain walls , and the whole network of strings and walls collapses , dissipating energy again into _ relativistic _ axions .",
    "hence the axion density in the universe contains two separate components : the non - relativistic component due to coherent oscillations of the axion field , and the relativistic component due to the radiation from topological defects .",
    "the latter component can be significant , and may even dominate the non - relativistic component for large values of the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale .",
    "relativistic axions can also have anisotropic stress and hence they can couple to gravitational waves just as neutrinos do .    the spectral energy density of relativistic axions has been debated and there has been some disagreement between davis @xcite and sikivie et al .",
    "we will be using davis s spectral distribution which has recently been verified by field theoretic lattice simulations in @xcite and @xcite , @xmath102\\frac{dq}{q}\\label{axionspectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , as previously defined , @xmath60 is the comoving momentum , @xmath103 gev is the pq symmetry breaking scale , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ev and @xmath107 is the time at which the axions decoupled .",
    "the mass of the axion @xmath108 and the decoupling temperature @xmath109 of axions is related to the scale @xmath110 through @xcite @xmath111 @xmath112 since @xmath113 , we can find @xmath107 using @xmath109 and the scale factor @xmath5 in ( [ scalefactor ] )",
    ". we will consider damping from relativistic axions with the spectrum ( [ axionspectrum ] ) for three different @xmath110 values @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 gev .",
    "this lies within the range @xmath117 where the lower bound on @xmath110 comes from astrophysical constraints @xcite and the upper bound which comes from the requirement that the energy density in relativistic axions remain below critical energy density to avoid overclosing the universe . to calculate the anisotropic stress @xmath118",
    ", we need the unperturbed phase space distribution function @xmath66 of these relativistic axions which we can read off from ( [ axionspectrum ] ) @xmath119\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , there are few differences from the neutrino case of ( [ stress ] ) .",
    "since axions have a non - thermal spectrum , we do nt do the substitution of ( [ x ] ) and retain the expression for @xmath120 in ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "thus , the expression for @xmath118 for axions becomes    @xmath121    where @xmath13 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ stress ] ) and @xmath122 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ alphadefn ] )",
    "for massless neutrinos , the effects of damping are determined solely by the neutrino energy density contribution , ( which falls as @xmath123 ) once one enters the matter - dominated era , and will thus be most significant for @xmath124 .    the effect of non - zero neutrino masses will be to add an extra @xmath9-dependence to damping , as free streaming , and hence damping , will be reduced when the temperature is of order of the mass .",
    "@xmath9-modes that come inside the horizon while neutrinos are relativistic , and contribute significantly to the overall energy density , will be damped more .",
    "on the other hand , those modes that come inside the horizon at later times , either when neutrino masses become significant , or during matter domination , when the neutrino energy density fraction may have been reduced considerably due to redshifting will be damped less .",
