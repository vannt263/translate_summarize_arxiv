    "the bondi - hoyle - littleton or wind accretion process occurs when a compact object moves with respect to an uniformly distributed perfect fluid considered free of self gravity @xcite .",
    "this problem has been studied analytically and numerically in newtonian @xcite and relativistic regimes @xcite . in the relativistic regime",
    "this process has been associated to high energy sources , for a review see @xcite .",
    "the process has been analyzed for various types of compact objects acting as accretors and in this paper we concentrate on the case of a black hole . in its most advanced fashion ,",
    "the bhl accretion on rotating black holes includes the radiation of the fluid restricted to 2d @xcite , 2.5d magnetized fluids in @xcite and the case when the fluid has density gradients @xcite .",
    "one of the important aspects of this accretion process is that when the relative speed between the accretor and the fluid is supersonic , a high density region with a conic shape , called shock cone is formed on the rare part of the accretor .",
    "when the compact object is rotating , the fluid of the shock cone gets dragged by rotation , eventually distorted and its motion may be unstable ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the stability is important because it would provide a model for abrupt acceleration of gas in high density regions near a compact object , which in turn could help modeling short and high energy emissions @xcite .",
    "the stability of the shock cone is described in terms of whether or not the flow is steady near the accretor .",
    "particularly interesting is the instability of the flip - flop ( ff ) type , which happens when the angular momentum of the shock cone starts changing sign and eventually the cone blows up .",
    "this instability involves on the one hand the nature of the accretor , for instance a black hole with an event horizon and a neutron star may show different behavior due to the different nature of their surfaces , on the other hand the stability depends on the dynamical conditions of the wind , for instance its velocity and the speed of sound associated to its equation of state .",
    "empirical criteria have been proposed to establish a regime of stability of the shock cone , independent of the accretor and more focused on the relation of the accretor size and bondi accretion radius ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given that this analysis requires the evolution of the wind by numerical means , for example , on top of the curved background space - time of a black hole , there is still controversy about whether the instability is physical or due to the numerical methods used .",
    "for instance , in @xcite some dynamical arguments are found that show that the instability is physical , whereas in @xcite it is shown that it might be due to an inadequate numerical implementation .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the ff instability of the shock cone for the particular case in which the accretor is a spinning black hole and the wind is a relativistic fluid obeying an ideal gas equation of state in 3d .",
    "this problem has been analyzed in 2d in @xcite where a relativistic study of nonspherical supersonic bondi - hoyle accretion onto a spinning black hole with relative accretor size @xmath0 was made on the equatorial plane assuming s - lab symmetry , where @xmath1 is an approximate black hole radius and @xmath2 is the bondi accretion radius .",
    "we present these cases in full 3d because , as far as we can tell , such results have never been presented so far .    according to @xcite",
    ", the instability is expected to happen when the properties of the system involve a supersonic wind velocity with mach numbers @xmath3 and the size of the accretor with respect to the bondi accretion radius is such that @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in order to confirm or discard the stability in this regime , we explore the parameter space with this high speed and small enough black holes that lie within this regime , where @xmath5 ranges from 0.011 to 0.025 .",
    "we explore the accretion onto black holes with angular momentum parameter as high as @xmath6 and five representative orientations of the wind flow with respect to the axis of rotation of the black hole . in all the cases analyzed we found that there is no ff instability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : numerical_set_up ] we describe the rhd equations modeling the fluid and the numerical methods used . in section [ sec : results ] we present the set of configurations we experiment with and finally in [ sec : conclusions ] we describe the conclusions from our analysis .",
    "the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics are written as a flux conservative system , that assumes a standard 3 + 1 decomposition of the space - time , known as the valencia formulation @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the set of conserved variables , @xmath9 is the generalized rest mass density of the fluid , @xmath10 are the generalized momenta in each direction , @xmath11 is the internal energy , @xmath12 the fluxes and @xmath13 the source . in terms of the primitive variables of the fluid elements ,",
    "@xmath14 the rest - mass density , @xmath15 the pressure , @xmath16 the fluid 3-velocity , @xmath17 the specific internal energy , the conserved variables are defined by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the determinant of the spatial 3-metric @xmath20 of the three - dimensional spatial slices the space - time is foliated with , @xmath21 is the specific entalphy and @xmath22 is the lorentz factor . as usual , the system of equations is closed with an equation of state . in terms of primitive and conservative variables the fluxes and sources are :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 are the components of the 4-metric and @xmath25 the christoffel symbols of the space - time , @xmath26 the lapse function and @xmath27 the components of the shift vector associated to the 3 + 1 decomposition of the space - time .    we solve the system of equations ( [ eq : conservative ] ) using the cactus einstein toolkit ( etk ) @xcite which provides the necessary computational tools to evolve this relativistic fluid in full 3d .",
    "in particular we use the grhydro thorn @xcite , which contains high resolution shock capturing methods to solve these equations . for these methods",
    "we specifically use the hlle and marquina numerical flux formulae and minmod and mc linear reconstructors . for the integration in time",
    "we use a fourth order runge - kutta method . as part of the diagnostics tools",
    ", we use the outflow thorn that allows to measure the flux of rest mass across a given spherical surface and monitor the behavior of the accretion rate .",
    "we describe the space - time of the rotating black hole using kerr - schild ( ks ) horizon penetrating coordinates , with the axis of rotation parallel to @xmath28 as follows :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the mass of the black hole and we have assumed geometric units @xmath31 to hold .    the fluid is set initially as a spatially constant rest mass density ideal gas , moving toward the black hole and with a given asymptotic velocity @xmath32 .",
    "we assume the fluid obeys a gamma - law equation of state @xmath33 and thus we introduce the asymptotic speed of sound @xmath34 .",
    "once we define the value of @xmath35 and assume the density to be initially a constant @xmath36 , the pressure can be written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . in order to avoid negative and zero values of the pressure",
    ", the condition @xmath39 has to be satisfied .",
    "finally , with this value for @xmath40 , the initial internal specific energy is reconstructed using the equation of state .    in order to parametrize the initial data",
    ", we define the relativistic mach number at infinity @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the lorentz factor of the gas and @xmath43 is the lorentz factor calculated with the speed of sound . when @xmath44 is bigger than one , the wind is said to be supersonic and otherwise subsonic .    according to @xcite , the two parameters deciding on the stability of the process are the mach number of the gas @xmath44 and the relative size of the accretor with respect to the bondi accretion radius @xmath2 . in our case",
    "the compact object is a black hole and we define an approximate black hole radius to be @xmath45 , even though our hole is rotating .",
    "thus the relative size of the accretor is given by @xmath46 .",
    "this formula indicates that a relatively small black hole is equivalent to have the case of a wind moving with a small velocity @xmath47 .",
    "this explains why the cases where @xmath5 is small are difficult to track , and even more difficult in 3d .",
    "the reason is that the numerical domain is set such that it contains at least a sphere of radius @xmath2 in order to see the accretion process .",
    "slower winds imply a bigger @xmath2 , therefore demand a bigger numerical domain and consequently more computational resources .    in order to observe the behavior of the process in a general scenario ,",
    "we choose five representative different directions of the wind , that we characterize in terms of its orientation with respect to @xmath28 which is the axis of rotation of the black hole denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "these five different orientations of the wind are represented by @xmath49 , and correspond to directions parallel to @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "the etk allows the solution of the equations in cartesian coordinates , and thus the domain is a cubic box of a given size . in the case of the evolution of a wind ,",
    "two boundary conditions are required ( see e.g. @xcite ) , namely an inflow boundary condition in the upstream region of the domain , where the gas is being pumped into the box , and outflow boundary conditions in the piece of boundary where the wind is expected to exit the numerical domain .",
    "the etk does not provide the tools to automatically incorporate different boundary conditions on different faces of the cubic domain and we programmed a module that allows one to do it .",
    "there is another very important boundary to consider .",
    "since we are using horizon penetrating coordinates we are allowed to perform an excision inside the black hole horizon as done in @xcite .",
    "the excision method consists in the remotion of a chunk of the numerical domain inside the black hole horizon .",
    "the removed chunk is usually assumed to be a lego sphere which defines a lego shaped boundary inside the horizon .",
    "considering the light cones in ks coordinates remain open and point toward the singularity inside the black hole horizon , no boundary conditions are needed , and extrapolation of the fluid variables suffices to guarantee that the fluid is not reflected back toward the exterior of the black hole .",
    "this method is already implemented in the etk as described in @xcite .",
    "showing the instability of a given fluid configuration requires the perturbation theory analysis , which applies when equilibrium configurations are given a priori .",
    "another possibility uses the numerical evolution of equilibrium configurations and then numerical errors , for instance truncation or discretization errors act as the perturbation and eventually ( or not ) trigger an instability . when the configuration is stable , the perturbation is simply expelled and the system remains in a state pretty much the unperturbed one , whereas in unstable cases the variables of the system change notably .    in the present case we deal with the stability of a shock cone , which is a configuration that actually forms as a consequence of the evolution of the fluid and",
    "there is no equilibrium configuration given a priori .",
    "thus one needs first to evolve the system until the shock cone forms . the shape and properties of the cone",
    "are not constructed based on a set of assumptions on the density profile or velocity field , but merely given by numerical evolution .",
    "therefore , in order to know about its stability , the method consists in tracking the further evolution of the system , we simply need to evolve the system during a sufficiently long time and wait for the numerical errors to cumulate and then possibly make the cone to oscillate in a ff fashion or show any other type of instability .",
    "the different configurations of a wind accretion process are characterized by the following parameters : 1 ) the asymptotic velocity of the wind , 2 ) the initial rest mass density of the wind , 3 ) the adiabatic index @xmath52 , 4 ) the black hole angular momentum @xmath53 , 5 ) the orientation of the wind with respect to the axis of rotation of the black hole and 6 ) the relative accretor size @xmath5 .    according to @xcite , the size of the accretor and the velocity of the wind are the parameters that determine whether the shock cone is stable or unstable , and it has been estimated that in the range of relative accretor size @xmath54 with mach number @xmath3 the shock cone is expected to be unstable .    in this paper",
    "we explore two sizes of the black hole .",
    "we first consider a mildly small size black hole with @xmath0 . with these sizes",
    "the shock cone should be stable , however since they have not been shown before in 3d we present them here . on the other hand ,",
    "a second set of experiments consider a very small accretor @xmath55 , which are in the regime of instability .      in the first set of experiments we use the following parameters : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath35 = 0.1 .",
    "the velocities are supersonic with @xmath58 and we use two values of the wind velocity @xmath59 , which correspond to sizes of the accretor @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "these parameters correspond to mildly small black holes with sizes bigger than those expected to show the ff instability according to @xcite .",
    "we also carried out these simulations for two values of the black hole angular momentum @xmath62 .",
    "the evolution was performed using resolution @xmath63 , on a domain @xmath64 ^ 3 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "this is a modest resolution compared to that used in the analysis using s - lab symmetry @xcite , however this should trigger an instability faster if any . in all the cases , that is , for the two velocities , the two values of the black hole angular momentum and the five orientations of the wind we did not find the ff instability , as expected for these parameters . in table [ tab : unperturbedmach3_5 ] we list the set of configurations for which we track the evolution of the wind .    in these simulations",
    "there are already some previously unknown results , for example , the case @xmath65 , which is the generalization of the s - lab studies shown in for instance @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that there was a ff instability , whereas in @xcite the use of horizon penetrating coordinates to describe the black hole indicated that there is no such instability .",
    "however both analyses were done using s - lab symmetry and the result in 3d was still uncertain .",
    "we show for the first time , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fromright ] , a snapshot of the cone in 3d for the case with @xmath66 , @xmath67 and black hole angular momentum @xmath6 .",

    "for faster winds with @xmath172 and @xmath173 within the regime of expected instability there are no signs of instability either .",
    "the implementation of the relativistic hydrodynamics , both in special and general relativity of the etk has been tested severely @xcite .",
    "however we have added a module that deals with specific boundary conditions that needs to be tested .",
    "we present a test relevant to the results presented here , the exact solution of radial accretion of an ideal gas onto a schwarzschild black hole known as michel solution @xcite .",
    "the first step to construct the exact solution is to integrate the evolution equations in spherical symmetry @xmath174 and @xmath175 ,          after we substitute @xmath180 in equations ( [ eq : urho2 ] ) and reorder therms we obtain @xmath181 + \\frac{dr}{r}\\left[2v^2 - \\frac{m}{ru_0 ^ 2}\\right]=0 $ ] , where @xmath182 . in order to have solution for @xmath177 and @xmath178 , the condition must satisfy at the same time the relations          once we know the critical values @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath188 , the constants @xmath191 and @xmath192 can be calculated and equations ( [ eq : constante1 ] ) can be solved .",
    "although we have constructed an exact solution , the system can not be solved analytically and for this reason we programed a newton - raphson root finder to perform this task .    in order to set the michel solution as initial condition into the etk grhydro thorn , we first interpolate the hydro variables into the etk 3d cartesian grid , and then perform the tensor coordinate transformation of the velocity field . in order to set a non - rotating black hole space - time we only set the black hole rotation parameter to @xmath193 on the kerr - schild metric . given that michel accretion is steady",
