    "a globally coupled map lattice ( gcml ) is a system of generally a large number ( @xmath0 ) of maps that iteratively evolve in discrete time ( @xmath1 ) and interact via their mean field .",
    "one typical example is a homogeneous gcml of logistic maps @xcite",
    ": @xmath2    this evolution can be regarded as an iteration of a two - step process .",
    "the first step involves parallel mapping @xmath3 where randomness is introduced in the system if the nonlinearity parameter ( @xmath4 ) of the map is set to be large .",
    "the second step involves interaction with a coupling constant @xmath5 via the mean field : @xmath6 here the distribution of maps is contracted to the mean field @xmath7 at the rate of @xmath8 by similarity transformation , and all the maps are forced to respect their average .",
    "hence , by this averaging step , coherence is introduced into the system .",
    "note that the relation @xmath9 holds and the average is kept invariant at the interaction step in this model .",
    "this is important for the stability of the model .",
    "this gcml is simple but it shows us how the conflict between randomness and coherence produces various interesting phases .",
    "( kaneko @xcite ) .",
    "however , in a way , gcml is oversimplified .",
    "the real physical process ( say , pattern recognition in the brain ) occurs in continuous time . at this point",
    ", it is tempting to construct a concise model of the globally coupled flows ( gcfl ) and study to what extent it inherits various intriguing properties of gcml .",
    "this study aims to search _ universality in complex systems ( gcml and gcfl)_.    how to choose the flow ( as an element of gcfl ) that replaces the logistic map ( as an element of gcml ) ? according to the poincar - bendixon theorem , we must consider a three- or higher - dimensional flow as an element to exhibit a chaotic behavior at the element level if the flow is autonomous , or alternatively , one may consider a two - dimensional flow under an external force . in this paper , we choose , for simplicity , a two - dimensional duffing oscillator under an external periodic force @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , it is known that the duffing flow shares the same period - doubling bifurcation to chaos with logistic maps , sharing the same feigenbaum ratio 4.6692016@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the reason for this universality is as follows : the two - dimensional flow of this model produces a one - dimensional iterated map on the poincar section and , therefore , the bifurcation of this model is in one - to - one correspondence with the bifurcation of the one - dimensional iterated map . besides , all the one - dimensional maps ( with a singly peaked function ) are governed by a universal function at the limiting bifurcation .",
    "the above scenario is crucial in the _ universality in chaos _ @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we numerically study to what extent the universality at the element level ( the universality between the logistic map and the duffing oscillator with respect to the bifurcation to chaos ) extends to the similarity between the systems , i.e. , the logistic gcml and the duffing gcfl .",
    "in fact , the above universality ( at the element level ) extends to a certain higher - dimensional flow and relates it down to a one - dimensional map .",
    "for instance , the three - dimensional lorenz model @xcite ( with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) has three prominent @xmath15 bands , in which it shows period doubling @xcite .",
    "the key to this issue is that the lorenz system is dissipative .",
    "hence , the effective dimension of the orbit reduces to two in this regime , and on the poincar section , it is equivalent to a one - dimensional iterated map @xcite .",
    "our preliminary analysis of the coupled lorenz system shows intriguing results : ( 1 ) for strong coupling , a two - clustered attractor is formed just as in the duffing gcfl .",
    "( 2 ) for weaker coupling , the distribution of flows ( at any time after the transient process ) forms a one - dimensional closed string ( single @xmath16 type ) in the three - dimensional phase space , and as we reduce the coupling further , the string bifurcates at the critical point into two closed strings ( two @xmath16 strings linking each other ) .",
    "this type of topology change is known to occur for a single lorenz attractor @xcite .",
    "we defer the discussion of the lorenz gcfl to a forthcoming paper .",
    "note that the duffing equation has symmetry under the transformation @xmath17 , which allows for pairwise attractors .",
    "that is , if @xmath18 is a solution of , then @xmath19 is also a solution , where the symbols @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , denote the time translation for half period of the external force and the parity transformation in the two - dimensional phase space .",
    "depending on the initial value , a duffing flow may fall in one of the two attractors . on the other hand ,",
    "the logistic map has only a single attractor independent of the initial point .",
    "this difference at the element level is reflected in the final structure of the attractors of coupled models and we will discuss this in detail .",
    "some results in this paper were reported at arob 13 @xcite .",
    "this paper presents our completed work with a deepened understanding of gcml - gcfl correspondence ( especially relation and ) . on the basis of high statistics simulations ,",
    "we report below detailed phase diagrams of the duffing gcfl and the bifurcation diagram with respect to the cluster composition ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : duffing gcfl ] , we first construct a duffing gcfl along the same lines as gcml .",
    "we put duffing flows in all - to - all interaction via their mean field .",
    "this interaction acts on the `` coordinates '' of flows @xmath23 . at this point , this model differs from most of the other synchronization models of flows , where elements interact via the time derivatives @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the manner in which the nonlinearity of both gcfl and gcml is matched is described in detail .",
    "then , we study the phase structure of the duffing gcfl by varying the coupling @xmath5 as a free parameter . we find that the phase diagram of the duffing gcfl resembles that of the logistic gcml .",

    "here flows divide themselves into two synchronizing clusters and the orbits of the two clusters bifurcate as the population imbalance between the two clusters increases .",
    "this bifurcation precisely corresponds to the phenomenon in the two - clustered regime of the logistic gcml discovered by @xcite .",
    "this may also be considered as an extended universality . however , there is a subtlety owing to the attractor pairing",

    "the answer is yes , but , in order to fully understand the @xmath22-bifurcation in gcfl , we have to take account of an attractor symmetry coming from the symmetry of the duffing equation .    in fig .  [",

    "the matching of the nonlinearity between the elements is fixed in [ subsec : duffing construction ] on the basis that one iteration of a free map corresponds to one rotation ( @xmath118 ) of a free duffing flow .",
    "there is no contradiction because in , the correspondence between two systems is considered , where interaction is in action and system nonlinearities are reduced .",
    "we discuss this point in detail in the following subsection .",
    "\\(ii ) in gcml , each of the two clusters evolves in its one - dimensional orbit and two orbits of the clusters approximately agree with each other ( precisely if @xmath116 ) modulo a shift of one step . in the duffing gcfl , on the other hand , the cluster attractor is two dimensional under the @xmath124 symmetry . both ( i ) and ( ii ) together realize quite similar @xmath22-bifurcation diagrams for gcml and gcfl .",
    "let us add a brief remark here .",
    "the gcfl @xmath22-bifurcation diagram is strongly polarized ( the larger @xmath22 forks are missing ) in contrast to the unpolarized gcml diagram .",

    "[ fig : fig8 ] presents the gcfl polarization - free @xmath22-bifurcation diagram thus obtained .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first observation of @xmath22-bifurcation in the globally coupled duffing flows and its comparison with @xmath22-bifurcation in gcml .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate if a posi - nega switch found in the gcml @xcite can also be realized in gcfl , but we defer this for the following reasons . in gcml ,",
    "the two periodic clusters have negative lyapunov exponents . and",
    "@xmath64 , the lyapunov exponents generally divide into two sets .",
    "the first one consists of two exponents , @xmath127 and @xmath128 fold degenerate , respectively .",
    "these are responsible for the contraction of the maps to the center of the respective cluster .",
    "for the two clusters of concern , we have measured these as negative @xcite .",
    "the second consists of two exponents that are responsible for the stability of the cluster orbits and they are also negative . ] in several steps of iteration , the variance of map coordinates in each cluster becomes less than the machine epsilon @xcite .",
    "one could introduce low level noises to avoid numerical collisions , but then the analysis of the posi - nega switch will involve technical subtleties .",
    "the gcfl attractors have also negative lyapunov exponents and share the same difficulty in the numerical analysis .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that the gcfl two - clustered attractors are robust in the sense that the threshold value @xmath129 to the decay into a chaotic transient process is quite high ( @xmath130 ) ( or quite low @xmath131 ) . this is a negative indication for an implementation of the switch , because , in order to enhance the population imbalance beyond the threshold , many elements must be transferred from the minority to the majority cluster and , then , the above collision problem becomes more severe in the gcfl than in the gcml .",
    "the periodic attractor in the two - clustered regime is a consequence of the reduction in the high nonlinearity of the elements caused by the averaging interaction via the mean field .",
    "we first recapitulate this issue in gcml , where some quantitative understanding is possible on the basis of the perez - cerdeira transformation for the quadratic map .",
    "we then numerically investigate the case of gcfl in some detail .          in gcml ,",
    "all element maps have high nonlinearity , and the maps would evolve independently in random motion if the interaction would be switched off .",
    "however , at every iteration step , the map coordinates are uniformly contracted to the mean field and coherence is introduced .",
    "the nonlinearity of the system is effectively reduced and the periodic clustered attractors are formed .",
    "now , interestingly , there is a case in which this reduction can be quantitatively estimated .",
    "this is the case of the maximally symmetric cluster attractors ( mscas ) formed in the turbulent regime .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed account . in the msca ,",
    "the maps synchronize in almost equally populated @xmath132 clusters that oscillate in period @xmath133 around their mean field .",
    "the most prominent one is the @xmath66 msca .",
    "in such an msca , the mean field is almost constant because of the population symmetry , and hence , it is possible to estimate to what extent the nonlinearity of the element maps is reduced . in fact , as the mean field is approximately a constant @xmath134 , the gcml evolution equation leads to @xmath135+\\varepsilon h^*,~~i=1,\\cdots , n.\\ ] ] then , the scaled maps defined by the perez - cerdeira transformation @xcite @xmath136 all equally follow the same scaled map @xmath137 the nonlinearity is reduced from @xmath4 to @xmath138 , where @xmath139 < 1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the rate of nonlinearity reduction .",
    "a good rule of thumb is @xmath140 .",
    "we can go a step further . taking the average of over the elements , we obtain @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the long - time average of a single map @xmath143 with nonlinearity @xmath144 .",
    "is , for the msca , an equal - weight average of the cluster orbits over @xmath133 clusters .",
    "but , again for the msca , this is nothing but the average of the cluster orbit points @xmath145 over period @xmath146 .",
    "this , in turn , is also the case with @xmath142 .",
    "namely , @xmath147 @xcite . ] solving and for @xmath4 and @xmath5 at a given @xmath144 and @xmath15 , one obtains the parametric form of a curve ( labeled by @xmath144 and develops with @xmath15 ) that describes the foliation of dynamics of a period @xmath146 window into the @xmath58 plane .",
    "@xmath148 we generally observe the period @xmath146 msca ( @xmath149 ) and its remnant state ( @xmath150 ) in the @xmath58 region , which lie between the two foliation curves emanating from @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( indicating nonlinearity at the @xmath146 window s opening and at the first bifurcation in the @xmath146 window , respectively ) . is an exception .",
    "it is observed down to @xmath153 . ] in the adjacent region ( with larger @xmath5 ) , period @xmath146 , @xmath132-clustered states ( with @xmath154 ) are formed .",
    "the foliation curves are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9]-gcml .",
    "we should now clarify the logic .",
    "the foliation curves are derived assuming the existence of the mscas .",
    "if a @xmath133 msca is formed , it must be within the @xmath58 region dictated by the foliation curves of the period @xmath146 window .",
    "furthermore , we can prove that at the msca , all the lyapunov exponents are negative and the msca is a stable attractor @xcite .",
    "however , the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "there is no guarantee that the msca is formed everywhere in the range specified by the foliation curves ; indeed for @xmath155 , we observe only the remnants of mscas ( @xmath154 clustered attractors ) as the valleys ( peaks ) in the distribution of the mean squared deviation of the mean field @xmath7 @xcite .    now , in the two - clustered regime of concern ,",
    "the maps divide themselves into two clusters , and the two clusters oscillate mutually around the mean field . here",
    "the attractor is robust in that it allows the population imbalance accompanied by the attractor bifurcation .",
    "however , in the particular case of @xmath116 , we can regard it just as a @xmath156 msca . with this concept",
    ", we can apply the above formulation to predict the possible region in which the two - clustered attractor may be formed .    in table .",
    "[ tablegcmlfoliation ] we compare the observed @xmath5 range of the two - clustered regime with the predicted bounds from the foliation of the period - two window dynamics . for the latter , the two curves from @xmath157 and @xmath158 are used , which are the opening point of the @xmath159 window ( the threshold of @xmath160 ) and the threshold of @xmath161 , respectively . table .",
    "[ tablegcmlfoliation ] shows that the observed range ( @xmath162 ) is inside the predicted bounds",

    "[ fig : fig9]-gcml shows that the observed band for the formation of two - clustered attractors runs just in the center of the above two foliation curves .",
    ".[tablegcmlfoliation ] two - clustered regime in gcml + [ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     let us examine how the observed parameter range in gcfl compares with that in gcml .",
    "since two steps in gcml correspond to one cycle ( @xmath50 ) in gcfl ( see ) , one may roughly predict the range of @xmath5 in gcfl via the data of @xmath5 in gcfl by a relation @xmath163 each side expressing the contraction rate in respective models . of the one - step contraction ( @xmath44 )",
    "factors are gathered and multiplied into a single factor after ( unjustifiably ) commuting them through all the small time ( @xmath45 ) evolution steps .",
    "however , we have checked , varying @xmath45 from @xmath164 down to @xmath165 , that numerically measured @xmath47 keeps the left hand side of almost invariant .",

    "note that the matching of @xmath27 and @xmath4 is considered between a free flow and a free map and then one period ( @xmath50 ) of a flow naturally corresponds to one iteration step of a map . on the other hand , is considered between flows and maps in actual interaction , realizing the correspondence .",
    "table  [ tablegcflfoliation ] shows that the prediction for the two - clustered attractor range roughly agrees with the observed @xmath47 range , although generally , the latter turns out to be somewhat higher than the former simple prediction . to analyze this issue globally in quantitative terms ,",
    "we show in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] , the band of two - clustered dynamics on the @xmath166 plane , where the @xmath47 axis is adjusted using the relation to facilitate the comparison with the gcml case in the left panel .",
    "we find that the two - cluster band in the duffing gcfl runs in the @xmath167 plane roughly like the foliation band of @xmath168 attractor in gcml in the @xmath169 plane but with two notable differences : + ( 1 ) the gcfl band turns out with a somewhat higher coupling , + ( 2)the gcfl band is less tilted than the gcml one . these differences can be understood as follows . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the basic two - clustered attractor with @xmath116 , which is free from @xmath22-bifurcation . in gcml",
    ", this is period two ( @xmath168 ) , while in the duffing gcfl , it is period one , as discussed in [ subsec : theta bifurcation ] ( see especially ) .",
    "pairwise clusters in gcfl _",
    "( each period one ) _ emulate the gcml @xmath168 attractor .",
    "therefore , while the nonlinearity is reduced from chaos to period two in gcml , it should be reduced deeply down to period one in gcfl , which requires higher coupling at the equivalent nonlinearity .        to quantitatively verify this explanation ,",
    "we have extended the range of @xmath27 ( @xmath4 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] ) such that it covers the periodic regime of the element flow ( map ) . in the extended region , the elements are already periodic and hence , if the coupling is sufficiently strong to maintain overall coherence , a single clustered attractor is formed , which evolves with the same periodicity as that of the element ( @xmath170 and @xmath171 for gcml and gcfl , respectively . )",
    "if , on the other hand , the coupling becomes sufficiently small , a multiclustered periodic attractor is formed in gcml ( @xmath172 ) , while in gcfl , the periodic external force compels the flows to synchronize in two clusters , one subject to @xmath173(@xmath37 ) and the other to @xmath174(@xmath38 ) depending on the bifurcation state of the element flows ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) . in the intermediate coupling , the extension of the central band of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] is formed for both gcml and gcfl .",
    "we clearly observe that the two - cluster band of gcfl is smoothly connected to the period - one window of the element flow at @xmath177 , just as the gcml two - clustered band flows along foliation curves to the period - two window .",
    "we have constructed a duffing gcfl as a natural extension of the logistic gcml and investigated to what extent the intriguing features of the logistic gcml are inherited by our model .",
    "this , in turn , amounts to an explanation of the extended universality at the level of the complex systems . to compare gcfl with gcml",
    ", we have worked in a scheme where the element flow is adjusted to have the same nonlinearity as that of the element map , in the sense that their locations in the ( universal ) bifurcation trees match each other , while the coupling @xmath47 is varied as a free parameter to seek if gcfl realizes the corresponding phenomena in gcml . as a byproduct , we have observed that the bifurcation - tree matching leads to remarkable agreement between the lyapunov exponents of the elements over the entire nonlinearity parameter value range .    the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] clearly exhibits that in the duffing gcfl , the same phases as those in the logistic gcml are realized in the same order with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the extensive analysis of the duffing two - clustered dynamics shows that the duffing gcfl has the ability of @xmath22-bifurcation just as gcml does ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "we believe that this is the first systematic observation of @xmath22-bifurcation in coupled flow systems .",
    "this clearly shows that the universality between a map and a flow is basically extended to the level of universality between the systems .",
    "however , we have found that there is an important distinction between the two models that comes from the fact that a duffing flow admits a pair of possible attractors under the symmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "the gcfl attractor in the two - clustered regime consists of pairwise clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) under a symmetry relation and each in period one ( returns the same phase - space point at every @xmath119 , modulo @xmath22-bifurcation ) . in the logistic gcml ,",
    "on the other hand , the element map has a unique attractor and the two - clustered attractor consists of two clusters , each evolving in period two but mutually shifted by one step ( i.e. , in opposite phase ) . this distinction depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] means that the nonlinearity reduction in gcml is only down to period two , while in gcfl , it is reduced deeply down to period one . to verify this ,",
