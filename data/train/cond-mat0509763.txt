    "efficient inference in large complex systems is a major challenge with significant implications in science , engineering and computing .",
    "exact inference is computationally hard in complex systems and a range of approximation methods have been devised over the years , many of which have been originated in the physics literature . a recent review  @xcite highlights the links between the various approximation methods and their applications .    in the current paper ,",
    "we extend a method that was introduced only recently  @xcite for inference in dense graphs using message passing techniques .",
    "the method has been employed previously only in the non - critical regime  @xcite , and is used here for studying both critical and non - critical regimes .",
    "we apply the method to two different but related problems : signal detection in cdma and learning in the ising linear perceptron ( ilp ) .",
    "multiple access communication refers to the transmission of multiple messages to a single receiver .",
    "the scenario we study here is that of @xmath0 users transmitting independent messages over an additive white gaussian noise channel of zero mean and variance @xmath1 . in the scenario of a code division multiple access ( cdma ) system  @xcite ,",
    "the signal from each user is modulated by a randomly chosen spreading code of length @xmath2 ; these signals are added up and sent through a noisy channel to the receiving station , which extracts the original message from the received signal using knowledge of the user s spreading codes .",
    "we consider the large - system limit , in which the number of users @xmath0 tends to infinity while the system load @xmath3 .",
    "we focus on a cdma system using binary phase shift keying symbols and will assume the power is completely controlled to unit energy .",
    "the received aggregated , modulated and corrupted signal is then of the form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bit transmitted by user @xmath6 , @xmath7 the spreading chip value , @xmath8 the gaussian noise variable drawn from @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the received message .",
    "this process is reminiscent of the learning task performed by a perceptron with binary weights and linear output .",
    "the perceptron is a network which sums a single layer of inputs @xmath11 , each weighed by a corresponding synaptic weight @xmath12 ; the cumulative contribution is an argument of some transfer function @xmath13 that gives rise to the output @xmath10 @xmath14 a normalisation factor @xmath15 is included to make the argument of the transfer function of @xmath16 .",
    "if the entries of * b * are @xmath17 the perceptron is termed ising perceptron . when the transfer function is the identity , the perceptron is referred to as linear  @xcite .",
    "the similarity between the linear perceptron of eq .",
    "( [ eq : perceptron ] ) and the cdma detection problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cdma ] ) allows for a direct relation between the two problems to be established .",
    "the main difference between the problems is the regime of interest . while cdma detection applications are of interest mainly for non - critical low load values , ilp studies focused on the critical regime .",
    "we consider both regimes in this paper , but to unify the treatment we will use the notation and scaling conventions of the cdma system .",
    "graphical models ( bayes belief networks ) provide a powerful framework for modelling statistical dependencies between variables @xcite .",
    "they play an essential role in devising a principled probabilistic framework for inference in a broad range of applications .",
    "message passing techniques are guaranteed to converge to the globally correct estimate in graphical models that can be represented by a sparse graph with a few ( typically long ) loops .",
    "there are no such guarantees for systems with loops even in the case of large loops and a local tree - like structure ( although see  @xcite ) .",
    "a clear link has been established between certain message passing algorithms and methods of statistical mechanics  @xcite .    in a recent development",
    ", we presented a new approach  @xcite , which was inspired by both , the extension of belief propagation ( bp ) to tackle densely connected graphs  @xcite and that of the replica - symmetric - equivalent bp to survey propagation ( sp )  @xcite .",
    "the systems we consider here are characterised by multiplicity of pure states and a possible fragmentation of the space of solutions . to address the inference problem in such cases we consider an ensemble of replicated systems where averages are taken over the ensemble of potential solutions .",
    "this amounts to the presentation of a new graph , where the observables @xmath10 are linked to variables in all replicated systems , namely @xmath18 ; where @xmath19 . to estimate the parameters @xmath20 given the data @xmath21 , in a bayesian framework",
    ", we have to maximise the posterior @xmath22 where we have considered independent data , and thus @xmath23 .",
    "the likelihood so defined is of a general form ; the explicit expression depends on the particular problem studied . here",
    ", we are interested in cases where @xmath24 is an unbiased vector and @xmath25 .",
    "the estimate we would like to obtain is the maximiser of the posterior marginal ( mpm ) @xmath26 which is expected to be a vector with equal entries for all replica @xmath27 .",
    "the number of operations required to obtain the full mpm estimator is of @xmath28 which is infeasible for large @xmath0 values .    for calculating the posterior in the case of both cdma and the ilp , we use the explicit dependency of @xmath10 on @xmath29 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cdma ] ) and ( [ eq : perceptron ] ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a free parameter of the model , to be optimised later in the process ; it reflects our ignorance of the true noise parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the variable @xmath8 is drawn from @xmath33 and the @xmath34 are small enough to ensure that @xmath35 . for facilitating the derivation that follows we also define the variable @xmath36 representing the uncorrupted signal .",
    "subsequently , the likelihood can be expanded to take the form    @xmath37 \\label{eq : likelyhood } \\\\ & \\simeq & \\int\\prod_{{\\rm a}=1}^{n}\\left(\\mathrm{d}\\delta_{\\mu k}^{{\\rm a}}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\left(y_{\\mu}-\\delta_{\\mu k}^{{\\rm a}}\\right)\\right]\\left[1+\\varepsilon_{\\mu k}\\frac{\\left(y_{\\mu}-\\delta_{\\mu k}^{{\\rm a}}\\right)}{\\sigma^{2}}b_{k}^{{\\rm a}}\\right]\\right)p\\left(\\mathbf{\\delta}_{\\mu k}\\right ) \\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using bayes rule one obtains the bp equations @xmath38 an explicit expression for the inter - dependency between solutions is required for obtaining a closed set of update equations .",
    "we assume a dependence of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a vector representing an external field and @xmath41 the matrix of cross - replica interaction .",
    "we expect the free energy obtained from the well behaved distribution @xmath42 to be self - averaging , thus we assume the following symmetry between replica @xmath43 and @xmath44 where both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are of @xmath16 .",
    "an expression for @xmath42 immediately follows @xmath47 where @xmath48 we exploit the assumption that the number of replica @xmath49 is large and employ laplace s method to find dominant contributions to the integral .",
    "the function @xmath50 exhibits two minima if @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; these will provide the only contributions in that limit .",
    "other regimes will provide trivial solutions .",

    ", by virtue of the central limit theorem , the variable @xmath63 obeys a normal distribution , whose mean value and covariance matrix are given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are macroscopic variables of @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , @xmath69 is a free variable that can be used to optimise with respect to a given performance measure .",
    "this corresponds to fine tuning of the variational model considered .",
    "all three quantities @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath69 are self averaging so we can drop both indices @xmath72 and @xmath73 the probability of @xmath74 can be expressed as @xmath75 having the probability distribution of @xmath74 we can express the message from nodes @xmath10 to nodes @xmath76 at time @xmath77 explicitly , using eqs .",

    "the distribution of this field is likely to be well approximated by a gaussian , as a result of the central limit theorem , whose mean and variance are @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively @xmath85 both are assumed to be independent of the index @xmath72 due to self - averaging . for the same reason we expect the macroscopic variables , representing the overlap between the vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 at any time @xmath88 and the squared length of @xmath86 , defined as @xmath89 and @xmath90 , to be @xmath72 independent .",
    "using the distribution we obtained for the gauged field @xmath81 , both variables can be evaluated by @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 . applying a method equivalent to the em algorithm  @xcite for the independent parameter of the model @xmath94 we have that the optimal selection of the parameter is given by the condition @xmath95 , which also implies that @xmath96 . notice that this result is not surprising as it maximises the normalised overlap between the vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
