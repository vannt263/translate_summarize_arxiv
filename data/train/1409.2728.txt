    "such an approach motivates phenomenological models that can be extrapolated to astrophysically relevant scales .",

    "the basic assumptions of universality and scale invariance that are common in studies of hydrodynamic turbulence are not well - justified and , as a result , not well - understood in the mhd case , and they require careful investigation . in the hydrodynamic case , the kolmogorov first self - similarity hypothesis implies that at scales much smaller than the driving scale , the energy spectrum of incompressible non - magnetized fluid turbulence has a universal form @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean energy dissipation rate , @xmath5 is the kolmogorov viscous scale , and @xmath6 is the fluid viscosity .",
    "the function @xmath7 is expected to be universal , that is , independent of the nature of the large - scale driving , and to satisfy @xmath8 . with the driving applied at scale @xmath9 , in the inertial interval of turbulence @xmath10 the function",

    "* ) . in mhd turbulence the kolmogorov self - similarity relation  ( [ espec ] ) does not apply due to the presence of the alfvn velocity @xmath16 associated with the large - scale magnetic field @xmath17 .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field mediates the turbulent dynamics at small scales , therefore , the energy spectrum may essentially depend on the large scale @xcite . in this case",
    ", the general form of the energy spectrum can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dissipation scale and @xmath20 is the scale parameter related to the large - scale organization of the flow  both can be different in different setups .",
    "the mediation of the small - scale interaction by the large - scale magnetic field implies that in the inertial interval , @xmath21 , one can not require that @xmath22 .",
    "rather , in order to establish the energy spectrum in this case one needs to study the nonlinear interaction of alfvn wave packets in detail @xcite .",
    "we start with the case of balanced weak mhd turbulence , where the average energies in oppositely propagating alfvn wave packets are the same . we assume a strong uniform background field , @xmath23 , and suppose that turbulence is isotropically excited at scale @xmath9 , such that @xmath24 .",
    "the weakness of the interaction follows from the fact that the linear alfvn frequency , @xmath25 , is much larger than the frequency of nonlinear interaction , @xmath26 .",
    "it has been derived that the inertial - interval energy spectrum of balanced mhd turbulence scales with the field - perpendicular wavenumber as @xmath27 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which allows us to write the asymptotics of the spectral function in the form @xmath28 one can demonstrate that @xmath20 , and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we observe that the inertial interval essentially depends on the outer scale",
    ".    a similar consideration applies in the regime of steadily driven balanced strong mhd turbulence .",
    "it has been found in numerical simulations and phenomenological models that the field - perpendicular energy spectrum in this case scales as @xmath30 @xcite , which implies the following asymptotic for the spectral function : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is related to the cross - helicity of the flow ( for example , @xmath33 , if the magnetic and velocity fluctuations are driven at the outer scale in a non - correlated fashion ) , and @xmath34 is the dissipation scale , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . in the imbalanced case",
    "it has also been shown that the asymptotic of the spectrum follows equation ( [ gweak ] ) in the weak imbalanced case  @xcite and equation  ( [ gstrong ] ) in the strong imbalanced case  @xcite .",
    "both examples demonstrate that the dependence on @xmath32 in mhd turbulence is crucial for establishing the energy distribution in both the inertial and dissipation intervals . in both cases",
    "the spectrum deviates from the kolmogorov @xmath13 due to a reduction of the nonlinear interaction by a certain mechanism related to the large - scale magnetic field . in the case of weak turbulence ,",
    "such a mechanism is the decorrelation of the triple - field products due to the short crossing time of counter - propagating alfvn waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of strong turbulence , a weakening of the nonlinear interaction is provided by the scale - dependent angular alignment between magnetic and velocity fluctuations , that is , progressive  alfvnization \" of the turbulence at small scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we argue in the next section , the dependence of the spectral function @xmath35 on the outer scale is crucial for the applicability of discrete numerical schemes for simulations of mhd turbulence .",
    "in this section we concentrate on strong mhd turbulence , and assume that the simulations are performed in a numerical scheme discretized at scale @xmath36 , which can be the grid size of a finite - difference scheme , the inverse dealiasing cut - off of a pseudo - spectral scheme , etc . in the presence of a numerical cutoff @xmath36 , the general form of the function @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "the solution of the discrete scheme in general is different from the physical solution and it may have different scaling properties as it contains an additional dimensional parameter @xmath36 .",
    "however , it needs to converge to the physical solution as @xmath39 .",
    "it should be recalled that in the hydrodynamic case , when the spectrum is independent of @xmath32 , the @xmath40 function can be written as @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , as long as the numerical resolution is a fixed fraction of the dissipation scale @xmath42 , the form of the function @xmath43 is universal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the presence of an additional scale @xmath32 in the mhd case means that there are infinitely many @xmath37 functions that provide the same inertial interval asymptotics , but have different behavior at the subrange scales .",
    "consider , for example , a spectral function @xmath44^{-1/6}g_1(k\\eta_s , k\\delta ) , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\label{example}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "the expression ( [ example ] ) agrees with the inertial scaling of @xmath46 , while it steepens at small scales due to the finite discretization cutoff  @xmath36 . in this example , the scaling of the numerically measured energy spectrum changes at scale @xmath47 from @xmath46 to @xmath48 ; however , this spectral steepening represents the property of the numerical scheme , not of the physical solution . in order to avoid the influence of numerical effects , one needs to ensure that the discretization cutoff is sufficiently small .",
    "for instance , in order to observe the inertial interval up to the dissipation scale  @xmath49 , one needs to require that  @xmath50 .    in this example",
    "the discretization scale in the numerical simulations needs to decrease faster than the dissipation scale , for the simulations to be resolved . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate that a similar situation is encountered in simulations of mhd turbulence .",
    "the incompressible mhd equations can be written in the elssser form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the elssser variables , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the fluctuating velocity and magnetic fields in units of the alfvn velocity , @xmath55 . in these equations",
    "@xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the plasma pressure , @xmath58 is the background plasma density and @xmath6 is the fluid viscosity . for simplicity , the viscosity is equal to the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the turbulence is driven at large scales by the forces  @xmath59 . in the linear case",
    ", the plasma waves can be decomposed into shear alfvn waves whose polarizations are perpendicular to both @xmath60 and the wave - vector @xmath61 , and pseudo - alfvn waves whose polarizations are in the plane of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and perpendicular to @xmath61 .    in the case of strong mhd turbulence ,",
    "the pseudo - alfvn modes are dynamically irrelevant for the turbulent cascade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one can therefore filter out the pseudo - alfvn modes by setting @xmath62 , which reduces the equations to the reduced mhd model : @xmath63 we note that in rmhd the fluctuating fields have only two vector components , but that each depends on all three spatial coordinates . due to incompressibility ,",
    "each field has only one degree of freedom , which can be expressed in terms of stream functions in the more standard form of the rmhd equations  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between rmhd and mhd in the strong turbulence regime has been shown in numerical simulations ; for an extensive discussion see  @xcite . in light of this equivalence",

    "this numerical effect disappears as the resolution is increased to @xmath86 without changing the physical parameters of the simulations ( the dashed curve ) , where the inertial interval now extends to about @xmath87 . ]",

    "the dash - dotted line shows the same set up with decreased viscosity , which makes the dissipation scale approach the numerical cut - off .",
    "the scales at @xmath88 are now significantly affected by the proximity to the dealiasing cut - off ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; our mhd runs bear similarity with those results .",
    "such a spectral distortion is a property of the numerical scheme and it should not be confused with the inertial interval behavior . indeed , as one increases the number of grid points to @xmath86 ( thereby reducing @xmath36 to @xmath90 ) , while keeping all the physical parameters unchanged , the numerical distortion disappears , see the dashed line in figure .",

    "[ fig : spectra2 ] .",
    "this is not surprising ; as was discussed in the previous section , the scaling of the numerical solution close to the discretization cutoff may be different from the scaling of the physical solution if the former does not approximate the latter .",
    "such a scaling of unresolved runs was previously observed in @xcite , where it was incorrectly attributed to the scaling of the physical solution because the numerical convergence was not checked .",
    "the presented results reveal an important property of the dissipation interval of mhd turbulence .",
    "as we have seen , two scales play a role here : the physical dissipation scale , @xmath94 , given by  ( [ eta_s ] ) , and the scale , @xmath95 , given by  ( [ eta_h ] ) .",
    "suppose that the discretization scale , @xmath36 , in numerical simulations is decreased proportionally to @xmath94 as the reynolds number increases .",
    "then , since @xmath95 decreases faster , at some reynolds number we will have @xmath96 and the simulations will become unresolved . in this case , the numerical scheme will not approximate the physical solution at scales close to @xmath95 .",
    "if starting from this point , @xmath36 starts to decrease proportionally to @xmath95 , the spectral distortion will be preserved , and the approximation will not improve ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : spectra2 ] ) .",
    "however , if @xmath36 continues to decrease slower than @xmath95 , the approximation of the numerical scheme will continue to degrade .",
    "we therefore conclude that in order to resolve the dissipation interval of mhd turbulence , the discretization of the numerical scheme should satisfy @xmath97 , and it should decrease at least as fast as @xmath95 to maintain the same level of approximation .",
    "the physical explanation of the observed phenomenon is the following . as proposed in @xcite , the @xmath46 scaling of the inertial interval of mhd turbulence",
    "is related to the scale - dependent dynamic alignment between magnetic and velocity fluctuations , where the alignment angle decreases with the scale approximately as @xmath98 .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that such alignment is present not only in the inertial interval but also in the dissipation range as long as we do not approach the numerical cut - off too closely @xcite .",
    "this alignment leads to the scale - dependent weakening of the nonlinear interaction , changing the naive @xmath48 scaling of the equation to the observed @xmath46 scaling of the solution .    in the unresolved intervals , however , the correlation between magnetic and velocity fluctuations gets destroyed due to the proximity to the dealiasing cut - off .",
    "a similar behavior has been documented in numerical simulations of hydrodynamic turbulence , where an abrupt cutoff in the @xmath89 space led to unphysical distortion of the energy spectrum @xcite . in the extreme case ,",
    "when the explicit dissipation was totally absent , the spectral cutoff would lead to an energy pile up and mode thermalization close to the cutoff scale . at such scales",
    "any spatial correlation of fluctuations existing in the turbulent flow would be lost .",
    "this figure illustrates the scaling of the unresolved numerical spectrum .",

    "the alignment @xmath105 is well - preserved down to the scale @xmath106 ( the dashed curve ) . however , in the unresolved runs the alignment is already significantly spoiled at scale @xmath107 , where the curves start to deviate from the @xmath108 scaling and flatten at smaller scales ( the solid and dash - dotted curves ) .",

    "it is reasonable to propose that a similar tendency exists in mhd turbulence when the physical dissipation is not strong enough in the vicinity of the numerical cutoff .",
