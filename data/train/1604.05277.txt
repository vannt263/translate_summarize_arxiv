    "the conservation of angular momenta between itinerant electrons and localized magnetizations in magnetic materials leads to the fascinating concept of spin - transfer torque ( stt)@xcite ; the spin angular momentum of the electrons can be transferred to the magnetization via their mutual exchange coupling , which enables to drive the dynamics of magnetization by charge current .",
    "the stt in ferromagnets ( fms ) , providing a vital information - writing technology , has been driving the explosive growth of the field of spintronics up until now.@xcite in textured fms , the efficiency of the stt ( in the unit of velocity ) can be defined by @xmath0 with @xmath1 the g factor , @xmath2 the bohr magneton , @xmath3 the elementary charge , @xmath4 the saturation magnetization , @xmath5 the charge current density , and @xmath6 the net spin polarization carried by the charge current .",

    "( [ u ] ) is directly applied to afms , one would conclude that there can be no stt in afms where @xmath6 becomes zero or vanishingly small ; recent research has been confirming that this is of course not the case .",
    "the study of stts involving amf materials was started by investigation of current - driven effects in spin valves or multi - layer systems where each afm layer carries a single domain.@xcite theoretical studies have unveiled an important role of the stt also in textured afms as in textured fms@xcite ; xu _",

    "the dynamics of afm textures driven by spin - polarized current has been also studied@xcite    thus far , however , it still remains an open question how the stt efficiency , the counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , can be defined for general afm magnetic textures.@xcite finding the stt efficiency would guide us to how to control the stts in afms for designing more prominent stt effects .    in this work",
    ", we develop a formalism of current - driven dynamics of two - sublattice afm textures , where the stt efficiency is provided in terms of unambiguous material parameters . a challenge in deriving the stt in the afms comes from the fact that the electron spin dynamics is not as obvious as in fms at all , because in the afm there are two exchange fields corresponding to the two sublattice - magnetizations , that the electron spin can respect .",
    "we formulate the stt in two regimes where the analytical expressions for the electron spin are available ; when the inter - sublattice electron dynamics is dominant over the electron - magnetization exchange coupling , and the opposite .",
    "we find that the stt mechanism that governs its efficiency can quite differ in those two regimes . in the limit of large exchange coupling",
    ", the stt can be generated due to spatial variation of the antiferromagnetic order . in the opposite limit ,",
    "on the other hand , the stt requires a sufficiently large canting between the sublattice - magnetizations .",
    "these predictions can be quantified by studying the response of afm spin waves to the charge current . in the limit of large exchange coupling ,",
    "the charge current inevitably causes the spin - wave doppler shift , whereas , in the opposite limit , it can modify the spin - wave spectrum only when there exists a pronounced sublattice - canting .",
    "our results demonstrate quantitatively that the stt effects in an afm highly depend on which class of afm we consider .",
    "we consider an itinerant afm composed of two sublattices ( 1 and 2 ) with equal saturation magnetization @xmath4 . in order to treat the magnetization classically ,",
    "the coarse graining for the magnetic channel is performed.@xcite the classical vector @xmath7 @xmath8 is a continuous function in space that represents the local magnetization direction in the sublattice 1 , with a similar definition for @xmath9 ; here the lattice structure is smeared out and the magnetizations of both sublattices are defined at every point in space .",
    "this classical treatment is allowed when the spatial variation of each magnetization is sufficiently slow compared to the atomistic length scale .",

    "<S> we formulate a theory of spin - transfer torques in antiferromagnets , which covers the small to large limits of the exchange coupling energy relative to the kinetic energy of the inter - sublattice electron dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our theory suggests a natural definition of the efficiency of spin - transfer torques in antiferromagnets in terms of well - defined material parameters , revealing that the charge current couples predominantly to the antiferromagnetic order parameter and the sublattice - canting moment in , respectively , the limits of large and small exchange coupling . the effects can be quantified by analyzing the antiferromagnetic spin - wave dispersions in the presence of charge current : in the limit of large exchange coupling </S>",
    "<S> the spin - wave doppler shift always occurs , whereas , in the opposite limit , the only spin - wave modes to react to the charge current are ones that carry a pronounced sublattice - canting moment . </S>",
    "<S> the findings offer a framework for understanding and designing spin - transfer torques in antiferromagnets belonging to different classes of sublattice structures such as , e.g. , bipartite and layered antiferromagnets . </S>"
