    "as far as one - baryon processes are concerned , baryons have always been approximated as static objects at leading order in heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) , and recoil corrections are treated as subleading perturbations  @xcite .",
    "however , the phenomenological successes of covariant approaches , in which recoil corrections are in effect resummed to all orders , challenged this point of view  @xcite .",
    "the initial theoretical rationale for covariant treatment of baryons comes from ref .",
    "@xcite ( also touched upon in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in which the pion - baryon triangle diagram was examined . figure  [ fig_trangle ] shows the said diagram , where @xmath3 is the incoming 4-momentum of the baryon and @xmath4 the momentum transfer . with different vertexes",
    ", this diagram contributes to various processes . in particular ,",
    "when both baryonic external lines are on - shell the diagram contributes to most nucleon form factors , and the loop integral is a function of @xmath5 .",
    "if the baryon is represented by the dirac field , the triangle diagram can be shown to have a branch - point singularity in the second riemann sheet of @xmath6 , an example of so - called anomalous threshold  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite argued that the static - limit approximation is not aware of this second - sheet singularity , so a lorentz - invariant treatment , or at least resummation of the recoil correction in hbchpt , is necessary .",
    "however , from a more puristic point of view toward effective field theory ( eft ) , symmetries and degrees of freedom are the only constraints one must stand by . along this line of thinking , if the anomalous threshold in the triangle diagram does turn out to account for important physics , one would like such an analytic structure to come out of the power counting , not the other way around .    we will show that a peculiarity of kinematics in the region centered around the two - pion cut @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the pion mass , allows the baryon propagator to be unexpectedly close to its mass shell .",
    "this eventually leads to the loop integral being enhanced by @xmath2 , compared with the standard chpt counting .",
    "the enhancement of this sort resembles that of two - baryon reducible diagrams  @xcite , and it demands change of power counting just like in the two - baryon sector .    the manuscript is structured as follows .",
    "we first give a qualitative analysis on the diagram and point out the configurations of loop momenta that enhance the integral .",
    "numerical results are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec_numerics ] , followed by a short summary in sec .",
    "[ sec_summary ] .",
    "we choose the rest frame of the incoming baryon , so that its four - momentum is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the baryon mass .",
    "the outgoing baryon has four - momentum @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 as functions of @xmath6 : @xmath14 in the physical region , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both positive real numbers ; hence , @xmath15 .",
    "chpt is expected to work in certain regions in the complex @xmath6-plane where @xmath16 is sufficiently small .",
    "note that the incoming baryon line can be taken to mean an outgoing antibaryon .",
    "if the antibaryon is on - shell @xmath9 , the outgoing baryon is far off shell @xmath17 , unless @xmath6 is large and comparable to @xmath18 .",
    "although both kinematic configurations baryon form factor and baryon - antibaryon pair production are very plausibly related by crossing symmetry , the latter is in principle out of the realm of chpt .",
    "the loop integral being investigated is given by @xmath19 where @xmath4 and @xmath20 label momenta as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_trangle ] .",
    "we have so far used relativistic kinematics , even though the framework is not covariant .",
    "the only assumption we have made related to hbchpt is that the internal nucleon line always propagates forward , so the intermediate states do not include any baryon - antibaryon pairs .",
    "power counting  la weinberg  @xcite tries to capture long - range physics represented by a loop diagram , by inspecting contributions from virtual three - momenta that push at least a subset of the propagators near their mass shell .",
    "when both pion propagators are on - shell , @xmath4 and @xmath20 satisfy the following equations : @xmath21 since @xmath22 , @xmath23 is found to a first approximation to be collinear with @xmath24 , plus corrections in powers of @xmath25 : @xmath26 and @xmath27 \\ , .\\label{eqn_k0}\\ ] ]    reasoning of the standard chpt counting starts by assuming external three - momenta to be of the same order as the pion mass : @xmath28 , where we have used @xmath29 to denote generically the size of external three - momenta . since the integral has dimension @xmath30^{-1}$ ] , loop momenta with @xmath31 do not contribute appreciably .",
    "therefore , the meaningful integration volume of @xmath32 must be of order @xmath33 . in the physics region where @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the volume of @xmath36 and @xmath37 itself are too of order @xmath29 , according to eq .  .",
    "it follows immediately that the denominator of the baryon propagator is controlled by @xmath38 , whereas the recoil correction @xmath39 is subleading .",
    "therefore , the static limit is justified . with the baryon propagator and the pion propagators",
    "being counted respectively as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we arrive at the standard counting that the loop integral   is of order @xmath40 .",
    "while the above argument covers the generic case of @xmath42 , it , however , needs modification for peculiar cases defined by special values of @xmath13 .",
    "pertinent to our concern in the present paper is the unphysical region where @xmath43 , with @xmath44 ; therefore , @xmath6 is near the two - pion cut @xmath45 .",
    "the condition   still holds , that the most important @xmath23-modes are those around @xmath46 .",
    "now that @xmath24 may take complex values , @xmath23 may too , i.e. , @xmath47 may be negative .",
    "so it is not surprising that there exists a small region of @xmath23 centered around @xmath46 in which the pion energy takes a value smaller than @xmath8 by @xmath48 : @xmath49 where we have used @xmath50 .",
    "although this is a small region of @xmath20 , with volume @xmath51 , all of the three propagators have large values because they are very close to their mass shell .",
    "especially , @xmath37 in the denominator of the baryon propagator is now of order @xmath52 , so the recoil correction @xmath53 can no longer be considered subleading .",
    "it follows that the baryon propagator scales as @xmath54 , and the pion propagators @xmath55 .",
    "putting together these elements , we conclude that when @xmath6 is within a small window around @xmath0 , @xmath56 , the loop integral is @xmath57 , enhanced by a factor of @xmath58 as opposed to the aforementioned generic counting . here",
    "the static limit is not a legitimate approximation taken by the baryon propagator : the leading recoil term @xmath59 must be retained in eq .  .",
    "the resummation of @xmath59 immediately reproduces the anomalous threshold  @xcite , as it was rather anticipated .",
    "we evaluate numerically the integral with only the first recoil term kept in the baryon propagator : @xmath60 .",
    "a feynman parameter is first used to combine the pion propagators and then the following identity is used to incorporate the baryon propagator : @xmath61 we then proceed by integrating out @xmath20 after completing the square in @xmath20 , eventually arriving at @xmath62    we wish to compare the above integral with its relativistic version : @xmath63 which has a well - known branch point at @xmath64 .",
    "the comparison is facilitated if the branch point of @xmath65 coincides that of @xmath66 .",
    "this can be achieved by retaining @xmath67 and @xmath68 as defined in eq .  .",
    "if we had chosen to conform to nonrelativistic kinematics for the outgoing nucleon , @xmath69 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 would have been @xmath70 however , the discrepancy between eqs .   and is not crucial for our qualitative statement regarding power counting .    to see how the branch point arises at @xmath64 , we first notice that when @xmath71 the integrand has two poles in the @xmath72 plane , and they will pinch at @xmath73 when @xmath64 .",
    "because the pinching in the @xmath72 plane happens at one of the end points of the @xmath74 integration , the corresponding singularity of the integrand is inevitable no matter how we deform the contours of @xmath74 and/or @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 has a branch cut starting from @xmath64 , running toward @xmath75 along the positive real axis .    for @xmath76",
    ", the contours in both @xmath72 and @xmath74 planes need to be deformed so as not to be crossed by the poles of the integrand .",
    "the chosen contours are shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_xypoles ] .",
    "in particular , the @xmath74 contour is a straight line from the origin to infinity , @xmath77 off the positive real axis .",
    "when @xmath74 takes a value on that contour , the integrand in eq .",
    "has corresponding poles in the @xmath72 plane .",
    "the trajectories of these poles as @xmath74 moving along its contour are represented by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_xypoles ] ( a ) , with @xmath78 .",
    "a similar story goes to fig .",
    "[ fig_xypoles ] ( b ) , in which the @xmath74 contour is illustrated by the solid line and the poles associated with the @xmath72 contour are marked out by the dashed lines . on a side note",
    ", there are other ways to evaluate the integral . for example",
    ", one can first calculate the imaginary part , i.e. , the discontinuity along the branch cut , and then the real part by way of dispersion integral .",
    "in fact , this is the way integral   is evaluated .     and",
    "@xmath74 integrations , where @xmath79 .",
    "the dashed lines represent the poles of the integrand in eq .",
    "when @xmath78 ( see the text for more detailed explanation).,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath74 integrations , where @xmath79 .",

    "[ fig_gamma_smallregion ] , with @xmath80 the ratio between the physical pion and nucleon masses .",
    "the solid lines correspond to evaluation of @xmath65 according to eq .",
    "[ eqn_doubleintegral ] . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the static - limit approximation ( dashed ) , which diverges at @xmath64 , and the relativistic results ( dot - dashed ) according to eq .  .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath65 around @xmath64 is clearly demonstrated by a peak in its real part and a rapid rise in its imaginary part .",
    "the difference between the recoil and relativistic representations of the diagram is very small .",
    "this indicates that the higher - order recoil corrections like @xmath81 are indeed subleading .     in neighborhood of @xmath64 .",

    "the dashed , dot - dashed , and solid lines correspond respectively to calculations in the static limit , with the relativistic baryon propagator [ eq .  ] , and with the leading recoil term [ eq .  ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]      the infrared enhancement is essentially the statement that within a small window centered on @xmath64 , @xmath65 scales like @xmath82 , rather than @xmath83 .",
    "the lack of analytic expression for @xmath65 understandably obscures this point .",
    "we wish to demonstrate in this section how the scaling changes near @xmath64 .    for this purpose , we rescale both low - energy mass scales @xmath6 and @xmath84 by the same factor , while keeping the only large mass @xmath10 fixed , and then look at how @xmath65 varies with respect to the rescaling factor . more precisely , we define the following function to quantify the scaling behavior , @xmath85 with @xmath86 intentionally set up to correspond to the physical pion mass @xmath87 : @xmath88 when @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , we expect @xmath91 . when @xmath92 is far outside of the enhancement window , which will always happen for a fixed @xmath92 if @xmath93 is small enough , the standard chpt counting recovers and @xmath94 .",

    "[ sec_enhancement ] could not capture this difference between the real and imaginary parts of @xmath104 .",

    "we have shown an example of one - baryon processes with an infrared enhancement .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath6 is inside a small window centered on the two - pion cut @xmath112 , the triangle diagram is enhanced by a factor of @xmath113 , compared with the standard chpt counting .",
    "similar to the two - baryon sector , the infrared enhancement calls for resumming baryon recoil corrections .",
    "the main reason for this change of power counting is that the pion three - momenta in the loop can take complex values in the unphysical region , which in turn diminishes the pion energy flowing into the baryon internal line .",
    "therefore , there exists an enhancement window in which the loop integral is dominated by modes that take all propagators to be close to their mass shell .",
    "we have evaluated numerically the loop integral to demonstrate the enhancement near @xmath64 .",
