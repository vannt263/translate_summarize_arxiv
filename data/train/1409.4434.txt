    "the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ gamma - ray satellite , with its unprecedented sensitivity , has revolutionized the study of gamma - ray emitting pulsars , increasing the known population from less than 10 to 121 pulsars @xcite .",
    "about one - third ( 40 ) of these pulsars were discovered in blind searches of the lat data @xcite . despite deep searches at frequencies @xmath4 mhz @xcite , confirmed radio counterparts of only 4 of these",
    "have been detected so far @xcite , suggesting a large fraction of gamma - ray pulsar population to be _ _ radio - quiet _",
    "_ _ fermi _ lat catalog of gamma - ray pulsars labels all the pulsars with 1.4 ghz flux density @xmath5jy as `` radio - quiet '' .",
    "however , as in the usual convention , we use the term radio - quiet only for those pulsars which have no detectable radio flux for an observer at earth . ] .",
    "a likely explanation for the apparent absence of radio emission from the majority of the lat - discovered pulsars is that their narrow radio beams miss the line of sight towards earth @xcite , and hence appear as _ radio - quiet_. however , the radio emission beam is expected to become wider at low frequencies ( radius - to - frequency mapping in radio pulsars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , increasing the probability of our line of sight passing through the beam . with this in mind , we used the archival data of the pulsar / transient survey at 34.5 mhz , carried out using the gauribidanur radio telescope during 20022006 , to search for decameter - wavelength pulsed emission from several of the lat - discovered pulsars . a possible detection of radio counterpart of the lat - discovered pulsar j1732@xmath03131 , resulting from the above search ,",
    "was reported earlier ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "weak ( and periodic ) pulsed emission from j1732@xmath03131 was detected in only one of the several observing sessions .",
    "although scintillation may explain the detection in only one session , another likely possibility is that the radio emission from lat - discovered pulsars might not be persistent , i.e. , they might appear in _ radio - bright _ mode only once in a while .",
    "two categories of radio pulsars  intermittent pulsars @xcite and rotating radio transients ( rrats ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  are well known for such emission behavior .",
    "motivated by the intriguing detection of j1732@xmath03131 , we embarked on an observing program of deep searches for the decameter - wavelength counterparts of the so - called radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars , using the gauribidanur radio telescope at 34 mhz . in the first phase of this _ deep search program _",
    ", each of the target sources in the selected sample of 10 gamma - ray pulsars3131 , with the aim of making its confirmatory ( re-)detection . ] was observed in multiple ( @xmath6 ) sessions .",
    "_ deep _ searches for persistent periodic signals were realized by time - aligning and co - adding the data from these multiple sessions , as described in section 3 .",
    "while the significant enhancement in sensitivity achieved this ways is important , the deep search program was motivated by two more crucial factors :    1 .   even for the handful of pulsars which are detectable at such low frequencies , the received periodic signals are very weak . especially at decameter wavelengths , interstellar and ionospheric scintillation , and contamination from radio frequency interference ( rfi ) ,",
    "can hinder detection of such weak signals .",
    "hence , a weak source , even if intrinsically persistent , may not be detected in all the observing sessions . in addition , the source may also be intrinsically variable .",
    "hence , it is important to observe the same field multiple times .",
    "2 .   assuming that our noise statistics are gaussian",
    ", a detection even at @xmath7 might appear quite significant ( chance probability of such a detection is less than @xmath8 ) .",
    "but the measured statistics generally deviate from the expected gaussian nature due to rfi contamination and/or systematics contributed by the receiver , and hence the possibility that a @xmath7 detection from a single observing session is due to some weak rfi can not be ruled out",
    ". however , detection of even a relatively weak periodic signal , but in more than one observing sessions on different days , consistent in pulse - shape and at the same phase of the period , is highly unlikely to be a manifestation of noise ( i.e. , a chance occurrence ) or some rfi .",
    "such consistency across observing sessions , is therefore crucial to raise the level of confidence in establishing the astrophysical origin of an otherwise weak signal .",
    "all the lat - discovered pulsars which we have searched for , are isolated pulsars with periods in the range 48444  ms , and only j1813@xmath01246 and j1954@xmath92836 have periods below 100  ms . among the pulsars for which deep searches have been carried out ,",
    "j1732@xmath03131 is followed - up most extensively ( 125 observing sessions ) .",
    "we present here results of our sensitive searches using these follow - ups of j1732@xmath03131 and 9 other pulsars , as well as those using the archival data , and provide useful constraints on the decameter - wavelength flux densities of several radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "section 2 describes details of the archival data and our new observations . in section 3 , we explain the search methodologies . section 4 presents results of follow - up searches of j1732@xmath03131 and several other gamma - ray pulsars , and the upper limits obtained on flux densities of these targets , followed by conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the archival as well as the new observations were carried out using the gauribidanur radio telescope .",
    "the telescope originally consisted of an array of 640 dipoles ( @xmath10  rows ) in the east - west direction ( hereafter ew array ) and an array of 360 dipoles extending southwards from the center of the ew array @xcite . presently ,",
    "_ only _ the ew arm of this telescope is maintained , and the survey as well as the new observations were carried out using this array in coherent phased - array mode .",
    "the beam widths of the ew array are 21 arcmin and @xmath11 in right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) , respectively , with an effective collective area of about @xmath12 at the instrumental zenith ( @xmath13 dec ) .",
    "the target source is tracked during the observation by steering the phased - array beam electronically . in both sets of observations ,",
    "data were acquired using the portable pulsar receiver ( hereafter ppr ; deshpande , ramkumar , chandrasekaran and vinutha , in preparation ) as described in section 2.3 .",
    "the pulsar / transient survey was carried out in the years 20022006 using the ew array at 34.5  mhz , with a bandwidth of 1.05  mhz .",
    "the full accessible declination range ( @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) could be covered with 5 discrete pointings in declination : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "appropriate pointings were made to cover a large range in right ascension .",
    "apart from j1732@xmath03131 , data towards 16 other0602 was reported while our searches were ongoing @xcite , while those of j1741@xmath02054 and j2032@xmath94127 were already known @xcite . ]",
    "gamma - ray pulsars are available from single / multiple observing sessions of this survey .",
    "other details of the survey observations towards these sources are given in table  [ ulimits_archival ] .",
    "under the deep search observing program , new observations of 10 radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars were carried out in multiple sessions spread over several months in 2012 .",
    "for these observations , a bandwidth of 1.53 mhz centered at 34 mhz was used .",
    "further , these observations could use only @xmath21 of the potential collecting area , since @xmath22 of the ew array dipoles ( @xmath23 at each of the two far ends ) were not available .",
    "however , a slightly larger bandwidth and longer session duration , as compared to those of the survey observations , together provided about @xmath24 improvement in sensitivity , despite the @xmath22 loss in the collecting area .",
    "further relevant details of these observations can be found in table  [ ulimits_new ] .",
    "two radio pulsars , b0834@xmath906 and b1919@xmath921 , were also observed regularly as `` control pulsars '' .",
    "the position coordinates of the pulsars j0633@xmath90632 and j0633@xmath91746 ( [ ra , dec]@xmath25[06:34:26 ,  6.5@xmath26 and [ 06:34:38 ,  17.8@xmath26 respectively , precessed to the epoch of observations ) lie close to each other .",
    "we observed both of these pulsars simultaneously by pointing towards the direction [ 06:34:26 ,  10@xmath27.0 ] ( since both the pulsars fall in the same beam , and well above the half power points ) .      in each of the observing sessions , ppr",
    "was used to directly record the raw signal voltage sequence at the nyquist rate ( with 2-bit , 4-level quantization ) , while tracking the source . in the off - line processing ,",
    "the voltage time sequence is fourier transformed in blocks of lengths appropriate for a chosen spectral resolution in the resultant dynamic spectrum , and successive raw power - spectra are averaged to achieve desired temporal resolution . for the archival data ,",
    "appropriate parameters are chosen to achieve 256 spectral channels across 1.05  mhz bandwidth centered around 34.5  mhz , and a temporal resolution of @xmath28  ms .",
    "for the new observations , the resultant dynamic spectrum consists of 1024 channels across 1.53  mhz bandwidth centered around 34  mhz , with a temporal resolution of @xmath29  ms .    to identify rfi contaminated parts of the data , _ _ robust",
    "_ _ mean and standard deviation are computed , and an appropriate threshold in signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is used separately in the frequency and time domains",
    ". first the rfi contaminated frequency channels are identified , and data from these channels are excluded while identifying the time samples contaminated with rfi .",
    "the rfi contaminated frequency channels as well as time samples are excluded from any further processing .",
    "most of the observations were conducted in the night time , and typically only a few percent ( @xmath30 ) of the data were found to be rfi contaminated . from the new observations , time - intervals cumulating to about one observing session duration were rejected for j0633@xmath90632/j0633@xmath91746 and j1809@xmath02332 .",
    "several of the observing sessions towards j1732@xmath03131 happened to be in the day time , and only 85 sessions worth of effective integration time could be used out of a total of 125 observing sessions .",
    "the individual observing session data were searched for presence of single bright pulses as well as for pulsed signals at the expected periods of the respective gamma - ray pulsars . while the detailed methodologies of these two kinds of searches can be found in @xcite and section  2 of paper  i , a brief overview is provided below .",
    "searching for bright single pulses involves dedispersing the data at a number of trial dispersion measures ( dm ) , and subjecting the individual time series , corresponding to each of the trial dms , to a common detection criterion , i.e. an appropriate s / n threshold . for optimum detections , the individual time series",
    "are systematically smoothed with a template of varying width , effectively carrying out a search across the pulse - width as well .",
    "we sample the template width range in a logarithmic manner , with a step of 2 ( i.e. , we use @xmath31 time - samples wide templates , where @xmath32 varies from 0 to a maximum chosen value , in steps of 1 ) , for a given peak flux density , the highest achievable s / n of a pulse is directly proportional to square - root of its width .",
    "hence , for an optimum width - search , we sample the trial pulse width range in a logarithmic manner . ] .",
    "we carried out the single pulse search in two different ranges of dms : 020  pc  @xmath2 and 2050  pc  @xmath2 , with the consecutive trial dms in the two ranges differing by 0.01  pc  @xmath2 and 0.05  pc  @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the maximum match filter widths used for the two ranges are 128  ms and 256  ms , respectively .",
    "the s / n threshold is chosen based on how many `` false alarms '' can be tolerated in the final candidate list . for @xmath33 number of points in a time series ,",
    "the expected number of `` false - alarms '' , @xmath34 , crossing a threshold of @xmath35 ( in units of the rms noise ) solely due to noise , are given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the _ error function_. allowing 5 false alarms from each of the trial dms , implies a s / n threshold less than 5 .",
    "note that scaling - up of the denominator on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq_thresh ] appropriately , so as to account for the number of trial widths as well , does not make the implied threshold significantly different from 5 .",
    "so , we have used a detection threshold of 5 in our single pulse searches .",
    "however , detections marginally above this threshold can be confirmed only when reasonable number of single pulses are detected at the same dm . in case of detection of a single bright pulse , we need to insist on larger s / n ( @xmath38 ) , so that consistency as well as the dispersive nature of the signal can be checked across the bandwidth .",
    "the periodicity search using data from individual observing sessions involves folding the time series corresponding to each of the frequency channels over the expected period of the respective gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "the _ folded dynamic spectrum _ is then used to search for a dispersed signal , in a way similar to that used in the deep searches for dispersed periodic pulses described below ( section  [ sect_dsearch ] ) .",
    "we also search over a narrow range of period offsets around the expected period .",
    "extending the search in the period - domain is particularly important for the archival data , since the observation epoch is well before the launch of the fermi mission and the validity of the back - projected gamma - ray ephemeris can not be ensured . for the parameters of our search ,",
    "the optimum s / n threshold , as suggested by @xcite , is about 5 .",
    "however , we set a slightly higher s / n threshold of 8 to account for any low level rfi , as well as to be able to check for consistency of a signal across the observation bandwidth",
    ".    the multiple observing sessions towards each of the target sources allowed us to explore any transient or non - persistent periodic emission from these pulsars .",
    "the multiple session data from the new observations were used to carry out deep searches , details of which are given below .      since the rotation ephemerides for the gamma - ray pulsars are known from timing of the lat data , multiple session data from the new observations could be used advantageously to enhance our sensitivity for detecting a periodic signal .",
    "for each of our target gamma - ray pulsars , we use the pulsar timing software tempo along with the corresponding timing model , to predict the pulsar period and the pulse phase .",
    "the dynamic spectrum for each of the observing sessions is folded over the predicted pulse period ( the time - ranges identified as rfi - contaminated in the pre - search processing are excluded ) . the _ folded dynamic spectra _ from all the observing sessions of a particular source are then phase - aligned and co - added . while co - adding , the average band - shape modulation is removed , and the frequency channels identified as rfi contaminated in individual observing sessions are excluded . also , to account for possible differences in the effective integration time of individual sessions ( i.e. , the rfi - free observation duration ) , a suitably weighted average of the folded dynamic spectra",
    "is computed .    to search for a dispersed signal ,",
    "the final co - added ( or more precisely , _ averaged _ ) folded dynamic spectrum is dedispersed for a number of trial dispersion measures , and the significance of the resultant average profiles is assessed . to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , the profiles are smoothed to a resolution of about @xmath39 to @xmath40 in pulse - longitude , and sum - of - squares ( paper i ) or @xmath41 @xcite is used as the figure of merit to assess the profile significance .",
    "an in - house developed software pipeline was used to perform the above search .",
    "the pipeline was successfully verified using observations of our control pulsars .",

    "note that the observed pulse width is contributed to by various pulse broadening effects , viz .",
    "intrinsic pulse width , interstellar scattering , receiver filter response time , and residual dispersion smearing across individual frequency channels .",
    "however , the scatter broadening at such low frequencies dominates over other pulse broadening effects even for moderate values of dm .",
    "hence , at moderately high dms , sensitivity of our single pulse search , in terms of pulse energy ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , becomes independent of the _ intrinsic _ pulse width .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ fig_sps_smin ] which shows the minimum detectable pulse energy for intrinsic pulse widths of 1 , 10 and 50 ms , as a function of dm .",
    "for instance , beyond a dm of about 25  pc  @xmath2 , the minimum detectable pulse energy for all the pulses with intrinsic widths @xmath55  ms is same .",
    "we have followed the scatter broadening dependence on dm as modelled by @xcite .",
    "also , we have used the collecting area corresponding to a pointing declination at or near the instrumental zenith of @xmath56 . for a declination away from zenith , the sensitivity will decrease by a factor of @xmath57 .      for periodicity searches ,",
    "the minimum detectable flux density @xmath45 , i.e. , at the threshold signal - to - noise ratio @xmath58 , is given by @xcite : @xmath59 where , @xmath53 is the pulse width , @xmath60 is the pulse period and @xmath61 is the total integration time . for archival data ,",
    "@xmath61 is equal to the total observation duration of a single session ( i.e. , about 1200  @xmath62 ) . for new observations",
    ", @xmath61 equals the cumulative observation duration of all the sessions .",
    "our searches for bright single pulses as well as for periodic signals using the archival data did not result in any further detection of decameter - wavelength counterparts of radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsars . for the archival data ,",
    "the upper flux density limits for periodic as well as single pulse emission are presented in table  [ ulimits_archival ] . to enable easy comparison with the flux density limits at higher radio frequencies available in literature , generally computed for a detection limit of @xmath63 ,",
    "the upper limits presented in table  [ ulimits_archival ] are also computed for a ( s / n)@xmath64 of 5 . for the archival observations ,",
    "our target sources were generally offset from the pointing center of the beam . to calculate the factor by which the gain reduces at the target source declination , relative to the beam - center declination , we assume a theoretical beam - gain pattern : @xmath65 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath66  m and @xmath67  m. the flux density limits estimated at the beam center are then scaled - up using the above correction factors computed for respective source position offsets .",
    "note that we have carried out the above correction only for the offsets in declination .",
    "possible offsets in ra are less than 1  minute ( i.e. , above the half - power points in the beam - gain pattern ) .",
    "whenever archival data are available from multiple sessions , the offsets in ra are different for different sessions , and generally the ra offset is negligible at least for one of the sessions .",
    "hence , table  [ ulimits_archival ] presents the sensitivity limits for the best case when there is no offset in ra , and the limits in some cases might be underestimated , at most ( i.e. , in the worst case ) by a factor of 2 .",
    "the sensitivity limits for the single pulse search ( @xmath68 ) are computed for a nominal pulse width of @xmath69  ms , while those for the periodicity search ( @xmath45 ) are computed for a pulse duty cycle of @xmath23 and observation - duration of a single observing session , i.e. , @xmath70  s.      we carried out extensive follow - up observations of j1732@xmath03131 , distributed in 125 sessions , amounting to a total of 62.5 hours of observation time . in our deep search using an effective integration time of about 42.5 hours ( after rejecting the rfi contaminated time sections ) , we could not ( re-)detect any readily apparent ( i.e. , above a detection threshold of @xmath1 ) periodic signal from j1732@xmath03131 .",
    "our searches for single bright pulses as well as for periodic signal using the individual session data also did not result in any significant candidate above our detection threshold of @xmath1 .",
    "although we did not have any significant detection , the possibility of a signal weaker than our detection threshold can not be ruled out .",
    "since we have an estimate of the dm from our candidate detection of this pulsar ( @xmath71  pc  @xmath2 ; paper i ) , we can look for weak periodic signals at this dm that are consistent over multiple observing sessions .",
    "furthermore , allowing for the possibility that the periodic signal might be very weak , if at all present , we carefully chose the observing sessions that are virtually free from rfi contamination ( assessed by visual inspection of the dynamic spectrum ) , and where the dedispersed folded profiles were found to have full - swing s / n ( i.e. , peak - to - peak s / n ) more than 4 . such average profiles , corresponding to 21 sessions , are phase - aligned and presented in figure  [ j1732_mep ] . for comparison , we have overlaid the average profile from the original detection ( dotted line ; hereafter _ the old profile _ ) on the net average profile of all the 21 sessions ( solid line ; hereafter _ the new profile _ ) in the upper panel .",
    "the two profiles are manually aligned , since accuracy of the time - stamp in the archival data is not adequate enough .",
    "the two profiles , observed 10 years apart , exhibit striking similarity , and both are consistent with each other within the noise uncertainties . as a quantitative measure of the similarity ,",
    "the pearson ( normalized ) correlation coefficient between the two profiles is found to be 0.85 .    to further assess statistical significance of the apparent similarity between the two profiles , we performed monte - carlo simulation .",
    "an individual realization in our simulation involves generating a random noise profile and finding its cross - correlation with the old profile . to be compatible with the smoothed profiles shown in figure  [ j1732_mep ] ,",
    "the random noise profile is also smoothed with a @xmath72 wide window .",
    "the resultant noise profile is cross - correlated with the old profile at all possible phase - shifts , and the maximum ( normalized ) correlation coefficient is noted down .",
    "we simulated 10  million such independent realizations .",
    "the maximum correlation coefficient was found to be @xmath73 ( i.e. , equal to or greater than the correlation found between the old and the new profile ) only in @xmath74 of these realizations .",
    "hence , the probability of the old and the new profiles having the same origin is estimated to be 0.992 .",
    "in other words , the two profiles are consistent with each other at a confidence level of @xmath3 .",
    "the observed consistency between the average profile shape obtained by combining data from multiple epochs and that from the original detection 10 years ago , compels us to infer that ( a )  our candidate detection ( paper i ) was not a mere manifestation of noise or rfi , and hence ( b )  the lat - pulsar j1732@xmath03131 is not radio - quiet .",
    "if true , the dispersion measure of this pulsar is @xmath71  pc  @xmath2 ( paper i ) .",
    "also , our earlier estimate of the average flux density ( i.e. , pulse - energy / period ) of this pulsar in paper  i ( @xmath75  jy ; at 34.5  mhz ) was most probably affected by scintillation .",
    "the new average profile provides a better estimate ( since the scintillation effects are expected to average out ) , and suggests the average flux density to be 200400  mjy at 34  mhz .",
    "with this new estimate , non - detection of this pulsar at higher radio frequencies could be explained with a spectral index @xmath76 , assuming no turn - over @xcite in the spectrum .",
    "this upper limit on the spectral index lies on the steeper edge of the range of spectral indices for normal pulsars ( @xmath77 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a couple of observing sessions towards the telescope pointing direction of ra=06:34:26 , dec=10@xmath27 , we detected a few ultra - bright pulses at two different dms of about @xmath78  pc  @xmath2 and @xmath79  pc  @xmath2 , respectively .",

    "our assumed spectral index ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) , although lying on the steeper side , is well consistent with both these estimates . despite the large background sky - temperature at our observing frequency , for a couple of pulsars",
    "our flux density limits are better than those from deep searches at higher radio frequencies , and in other cases they are only within a factor of few of the limits from shorter wavelength searches ( provided the spectral index of these sources is equal to or steeper than @xmath82 ) .",
    "the above comparison of flux density limits may appear to be optimistic , since we have not assumed any turn - over in the spectrum .",
    "however , even with a turn - over around 80100  mhz , our flux density limits scale to typically a few hundreds of @xmath86jy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "further , if the lack of radio emission from the lat - discovered pulsars is indeed due to unfavorable viewing geometries , then the pulsars which could possibly be detected at decameter wavelengths can be expected to have steep spectra .",
    "if we assume a fairly steep spectrum with an index of @xmath87 ( for comparison , the spectral index of b0943 + 10 is @xmath88 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of our flux limits scale to less than @xmath89jy at 1.4  ghz , and some of them are still comparable to those reported at higher frequencies .    the possibility that some of our target sources are `` radio - loud '' , but have flux densities below our detection limits , can not be ruled out .",
    "the very faint radio emission from j1732@xmath03131 which could be assessed only by making use of its dm estimated from earlier detection ( paper  i ) , indicates the possibility of very faint emission from a few more of the ( so far ) _ radio - quiet _ gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "however , lack of radio detection from most of our target sources indicates that a large fraction of our sample may indeed be radio - quiet .",
    "consequently , the high fraction of gamma - ray pulsars being radio - quiet is consistent with the predictions of `` narrow polar - cap '' models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
