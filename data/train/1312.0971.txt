    "however , this timescale is also an approximate estimate for the minimum amount of time that the core has existed at densities similar to its current value , since if contraction is driven by self - gravity we do not expect evolution in core properties to be proceeding on timescales shorter than the local free - fall time .",
    "furthermore , depending on the degree of turbulent and magnetic field support , the contraction could be proceeding at rates much slower than that of free - fall collapse .",

    "the deuteration timescale is the time the core has spent evolving from a particular lower density initial condition to the current density .",
    "when comparing to observations , one has to take into account that dense cores have been evolving from lower densities , so models with evolving density structures are important to constrain the rates of collapse from the measured abundances of deuterated molecules .    the first line of table [ tab : dfrac ] lists equilibrium abundance ratios and timescales for the fiducial model , i.e. with @xmath5 = 10@xmath33 @xmath12 .",

    ", then this corresponds to @xmath6=146 for c and @xmath172=360 for o based on our choices for initial elemental abundances , which would greatly shorten the timescales if @xmath6 for n is comparable to our models .    in p09",
    "figure 7 , the equilibrium time for @xmath56 was @xmath43 5 times longer than the local instantaneous free - fall time .",
    "however , their conclusion was that the core did not reach the equilibrium .",
    "our model predicts a much longer chemical equilibrium timescale compared to the local free - fall time ( also dependent on @xmath6 ) .",
    "if we were to observe cores with the relevant high @xmath56 , then their ages should be relatively old",
    ".    therefore , in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath69(@xmath56 ) , our model agrees with p09 within a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "the major differences come from the assumption of initial depletion and core equilibrium state . these need to be constrained by observations .",
    "@xcite used a network with 4420 reactions , and their equilibrium time for opr@xmath44 is larger than 10@xmath109 yr , which is more similar to our value .",
    "they used @xmath5=2@xmath3210@xmath171 @xmath12 , @xmath34 = 10  k , @xmath173 10  mag , @xmath35=3@xmath3210@xmath36 s@xmath13 , starting opr@xmath44=3 .",
    "they allowed all neutral species ( except for h@xmath0 , he , n , and n@xmath0 ) to freeze - out , but no desorption was considered . one thing to note",
    "is that we are not sure about what initial elemental abundances @xcite used .",
    "they reference to savage & sembach ( 1996 ) who reported elemental abundances in a variety of environments .",
    "we are not sure what specific initial abundances @xcite used .",
    "so the comparison here is just qualitative .",
    "we have presented a parameter space exploration of the deuterium fractionation process , in particular of @xmath25 , in conditions appropriate to starless dense cloud cores in different environments .",
    "an enhanced 3-atom reaction network is introduced .",
    "it was derived from a reduced chemical network extracted from the kida database to which deuterium and spin state chemistry has been included .",
    "reactions involving h@xmath2o@xmath3 and its deuterated forms are introduced from , to be able to reproduce results from the more comprehensive model of .",
    "the effects of time - dependent depletion and dynamical density evolution have also been examined .",
    "compared to previous studies , our focus is on conditions that are also relevant for massive star formation , such as the massive starless cores observed by @xcite .",
    "our main results are as follows :    @xmath174 based on our fiducial modeling , the equilibrium value of [ @xmath175/[@xmath25 ] monotonically increases with increasing density ( from 10@xmath86 @xmath12 @xmath177 @xmath5 @xmath177 10@xmath87 @xmath12 ) , and decreasing cr ionization rate ( 10@xmath88 s@xmath13 @xmath177 @xmath35 @xmath177 10@xmath11 s@xmath13 ) .",
    "with increasing temperature , the equilibrium [ @xmath26]/[@xmath25 ] first moderately increases from @xmath34 @xmath73 5  k to @xmath34 @xmath73 13  k , then decreases to @xmath179 30  k. with increasing freeze - out , the equilibrium [ @xmath26]/[@xmath25 ] increases from @xmath6 @xmath73 1 to @xmath6 @xmath73 1000 , but drops from @xmath6 @xmath73 2000 to @xmath6 @xmath73 10@xmath109 .",
    "@xmath174 when the gas temperature exceeds @xmath73 20k , the ortho - to - para h@xmath0 ratio increases , reducing the deuterium fraction , so that warmer starless cores should display lower deuterium fractions ( as found in high - mass star - forming regions by fontani et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "@xmath174 the above findings are robust against changes in the initial elemental and molecular abundances .",
    "@xmath174 constraints on core ages and collapse rates can be obtained if accurate measurements of [ @xmath26]/[@xmath25 ] are made , coupled with observations of core density , temperature and ( co ) depletion structure .",
    "however , results can also depend on the cosmic ray ionization rate and the initial ortho - to - para ratio of @xmath180 .",
    "@xmath174 in the case of the well - known low - mass pre - stellar core l1544 , we estimate that the gas within the central 3600au has a deuteration age between @xmath736 and 10 times the current local free - fall time , depending on the initial value of the ortho - to - para h@xmath0 ratio .",
    "@xmath174 more generally , to reproduce the typical deuterium fractions measured toward low - mass and massive pre - stellar cores ( [ @xmath175/[@xmath25]@xmath92 0.1 ) , the following physical parameters are needed : @xmath5 @xmath92 3@xmath3210@xmath93 @xmath12 , @xmath34 @xmath114 17 k , depletion factor @xmath92 6 , and cosmic ray ionization rate @xmath114 10@xmath107 s@xmath13 . in general , these values of deuterium fractions require timescales several times longer than the local free - fall timescale . with no initial depletion ,",
    "the inclusion of time - dependent depletion / desorption has only a modest effect on these conclusions . also with no initial depletion , models with dynamically evolving density , increasing by a factor of 10 , require collapse rates about 10 times slower than free - fall to reach the above levels of deuteration in cores with @xmath181 .",
    "this suggests that dense cores with large deuterium fractions are dynamically old , which would likely require support against gravity to be provided by magnetic fields . for our fiducial model parameters ,",
    "the timescale to reach deuteration equilibrium is similar to the expected ambipolar diffusion timescale , i.e. , the collapse time of a magnetically subcritical core .",
    "the above conclusions can be avoided if the initial depletion factor is @xmath92 10 ( in which case rapidly collapsing cores could reach [ @xmath26]/[@xmath25]@xmath92 0.1 ) , the cosmic ray ionization rate is very high ( @xmath182 ) or if the initial ortho - to - para ratio of @xmath75 in the core is very small ( @xmath183 ) , although this last condition itself would require the parental cloud to have a significant age .",
