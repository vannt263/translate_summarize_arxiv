    "the * -algebra of a locally compact group  @xmath0 may be characterised uniquely up to isomorphism by a universal property : there is a natural bijection between nondegenerate @xmath1-homomorphisms @xmath2   briefly called morphisms @xmath3   and strictly continuous group homomorphisms @xmath4 , where  @xmath5 denotes the group of unitary multipliers of a * -algebra  @xmath6 .",
    "now let  @xmath0 be a locally compact , hausdorff groupoid with a haar system  @xmath7 .",
    "renault s integration and disintegration theorems describe the hilbert space representations of the groupoid * -algebra  @xmath8 ( see  @xcite ) . the hilbert space representations alone are , however , not enough to determine a * -algebra uniquely up to isomorphism .",
    "this complicates many arguments about groupoid * -algebras because the details of the definition of  @xmath8 reappear in every argument .",
    "we are going to describe the representations of  @xmath8 on hilbert _ modules _ over arbitrary * -algebras by a universal property .",
    "this universal property determines  @xmath8 uniquely up to a canonical isomorphism and should therefore simplify many arguments with groupoid * -algebras .",
    "the groupoid * -algebras for different haar systems on the same groupoid are canonically morita  rieffel equivalent , but not isomorphic ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "hence our universal property _ must _ contain the haar system .",
    "this entails some complications . to show how our universal property can be used",
    ", we apply it to two special cases , namely , tale groupoids and transformation groupoids of group actions .",
    "we describe their representations and thus their groupoid * -algebras .",
    "this implies that the groupoid * -algebra of an tale groupoid or a transformation groupoid for a group action is a crossed product for an inverse semigroup action or a group action , respectively .",
    "this description comes with a universal property that describes representations on hilbert modules as well as hilbert spaces .",
    "our universal property uses the commutative * -algebras of functions on the spaces of objects , arrows , and composable pairs of arrows in  @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , as it stands , it only works for hausdorff groupoids .",
    "the non - hausdorff case may be treated by desingularising a non - hausdorff , locally compact groupoid to a hausdorff , locally compact bigroupoid .",
    "furthermore , there is a variant where we add fell bundles , even non - saturated ones . the most general version of the universal property applies to non - saturated fell bundles over bigroupoids , which we view as partial actions of bigroupoids by hilbert bimodules ( partial morita  rieffel equivalences ) .",
    "since both fell bundles and bigroupoids create further technical complications , we discuss them only later , in sequels to this article .    when we combine our universal property with the representation theory of commutative * -algebras on separable hilbert spaces , the resulting description of representations of groupoid * -algebras on separable hilbert spaces is equivalent to renault s integration  disintegration theorem . besides the haar system on the groupoid , our universal property does not involve any measure theory because this would fail for representations on hilbert _ modules_. in fact , our universal property works for arbitrary ( non - separable ) groupoid * -algebras and only involves rather soft analysis .",
    "this is compensated by appropriate algebraic structures . for a locally compact group  @xmath0 ,",
    "our universal property for hilbert space representations gives haar - measurable weak representations , that is , haar - measurable maps @xmath9 from  @xmath0 to the unitary group such that @xmath10 holds for almost all @xmath11 with respect to the haar measure . together with the usual universal property for group",
    "* -algebras , this shows that any haar - measurable weak group representation is equal almost everywhere to a continuous group representation .",
    "similar automatic continuity results for group representations go back to stefan banach and andr weil .    throughout this article",
    ", we let  @xmath0 be a locally compact , hausdorff groupoid with a haar system , which we denote by  @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath12 , @xmath13 and  @xmath14 be its spaces of objects , arrows and composable pairs of arrows , and let @xmath15 be its range and source maps .",
    "we recall in section  [ sec : families_correspondences ] how to construct * -correspondences between commutative * -algebras such as @xmath16 for @xmath17 from topological correspondences between the underlying spaces .",
    "we construct some * -correspondences of this type from families of measures along canonical maps @xmath18 . using these * -correspondences ,",
    "we formulate our universal property in section  [ sec : universal_groupoid_hausdorff ] .",
    "we illustrate it by the example of the regular representation and relate it to the integration and disintegration theorems of renault  @xcite . for the universal property , we define `` representations '' of  @xmath19 on hilbert modules .",
    "our main theorem asserts that these representations are equivalent to representations of the groupoid * -algebra .",
    "we describe how to integrate and disintegrate representations in sections [ sec : integrate ] and  [ sec : disintegrate ] , and we show that both constructions are inverse to each other in section  [ sec : back_and_forth ] .",
    "this section finishes the proof of the universal property .",
    "section  [ sec : trafo_group_etale ] specialises to transformation groups and tale groupoids .",
