    "recent measurements of charm meson production in @xmath1 collisions @xcite indicate that there are important nonperturbative qcd phenomena in the production process .",
    "+ the so called `` leading effect '' or particle anti - particle production asymmetry is much bigger than predicted by next - to - leading ( nlo ) , qcd predictions .",
    "+ in this letter we study the @xmath2 distribution of @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons in the framework of a two - component model .",
    "the production of @xmath0 mesons in the model is assumed to take place _ via _ two different processes , namely qcd parton fusion with the subsequent fragmentation of quarks in the final state and conventional recombination of valence and sea quarks present in the initial state .",
    "+ the asymmetry obtained with the conventional soft charm component does not reproduce the experimental results .",
    "we show that with the presence of a hard charm component in the pion , the sum of these two processes gives rise to an enhancement at large values in the @xmath2 distribution of leading mesons .",
    "+ unlike the @xmath5 @xcite where the asymmetry is generated by the presence of the @xmath6 diquark in the initial hadron , the meson production asymmetry seems to imply the presence of a hard charm component in the pion .",
    "+ to quantify the difference in the production of leading and non - leading particles , an asymmetry @xmath7 is defined @xmath8 in the reaction @xmath9 - @xmath10 the @xmath11 and @xmath12 are leading mesons while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are non - leading .",
    "+ several models have been proposed although none fully account for the difference in production between leading and non - leading particles .",
    "the intrinsic charm model @xcite postulates the existence of quantum fluctuations in the beam particle that bring about fock states containing @xmath15 pairs .",
    "the @xmath15 quarks having the same velocity as the original valence quarks are likely to coalesce forming leading particles .",
    "although the shape of the asymmetry as a function of @xmath2 predicted by this model is similar to the experimental measurement , the prediction is to low for the whole @xmath2 interval .",
    "+ in @xcite it is pointed out that the annihilation of the @xmath16 from the proton and the @xmath17 in the pion would liberate the @xmath18 of the pion which can then recombine to form a @xmath19 and certainly not a @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath4 will not be enhanced because it can not be formed with this simple annihilation diagram .",
    "the recent measurement of significant asymmetry in @xmath5 production in @xmath20 collisions @xcite however , shows that there must be other production mechanisms at work that must account for the asymmetry .",
    "+ in two component models @xcite the production of charm mesons by parton fusion is the same for @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in section 2 the formalism to obtain the cross section by parton fusion is shown for charged and neutral charm mesons .",
    "the recombination of charm as the second component is discussed in section 3 .",
    "recombination , is different for the charged mesons where a parton process favors the formation of @xmath19 enhancing the @xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "this will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "in the parton fusion mechanism the @xmath3 @xmath21 mesons are produced via the @xmath22 with the subsequent fragmentation of the @xmath23 quark .",

    "1 the charm quarks will fragment into charm hadrons .",
    "when the @xmath43 is scattered , the spectator quark could recombine with the @xmath17 valence quark of the pion to form a @xmath49 or less frequently with an antiquark from the pion s sea . on the other hand , when the @xmath31 quark is scattered",
    ", the spectator quark @xmath43 could recombine with @xmath18 valence quark from the pion to form a @xmath50 meson . +",
    "as pointed out in @xcite the charm hadrons resulting from the scattered charm quark , populate the low @xmath2 region of the cross section , while those originating from the spectator quark dominate at high @xmath2 .",

    "@xmath56 one tries to resemble the distribution of valence quarks .",
    "in contrast with the parton fusion calculation , in which the scale @xmath57 of the interaction is fixed at the vertices of the appropriated feynman diagrams , in recombination the value of the parameter @xmath57 should be used to give adequately the content of the recombining quarks in the initial hadron .",
    "we used @xmath58 and therefore , the integrated charm quark distribution would take the value given in eq.7 . + the production of leading mesons at low @xmath59 was described by recombination of quarks long time ago @xcite .",
    "+ in recombination models it is assumed that the outgoing hadron is produced in the beam fragmentation region through the recombination of the maximum number of valence quarks and the minimum number of sea quarks of the incoming hadron .",
    "the invariant inclusive @xmath2 distribution for leading mesons is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 are the momentum fractions and @xmath63 is the two - quark distribution function of the incident hadron .",
    "@xmath64 is the two - quark recombination function . +",
    "the two - quark distribution function is parametrized in terms of the single quark distributions @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "we use the grv - lo parametrization for the single quark distributions in eqs .",
    "[ 3-quark ] .",
    "the charm contribution however , is parametrized with the distribution of eq .",
    "it must be noted that since the grv - lo distributions are functions of @xmath67 and @xmath57 , then our @xmath68 also depends on @xmath57 .",
    "the recombination function is given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 fixed by the condition @xmath71 .",
    "the inclusive production cross section of the @xmath0 is obtained by adding the contribution of recombination eq .",
    "[ rec - cs ] to the qcd processes of eq .",
    "[ sig - qcd ] , @xmath72 the resulting inclusive @xmath0 production cross section @xmath73 is used then to construct the asymmetry defined in eq .",
    "+ in the @xmath1 reaction however , the recombination of a @xmath74 gets a higher probability than the recombination of a @xmath4 @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "+ the process that releases a @xmath18 quark from the incident @xmath76 to form a @xmath74 ( after recombination with a c - quark from the sea ) is also present in the formation of a @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the released quark should be @xmath17 . in the @xmath19 case",
    "however , there is an additional mechanism that releases the @xmath18 quark from the pion , namely the fusion of a @xmath16-quark from the proton with the @xmath16 from the pion .",
    "this is correctly incorporated by the fact that a higher contribution from the recombination is needed to describe the @xmath19 asymmetry while @xmath77 ) production and its production asymmetry requires a small contribution from the recombination process .",
    "2 shows the model prediction for the @xmath19 and @xmath14 cross section and experimental results from the wa82 collaboration @xcite .",

    "3 together with all the experimental measurements available . fig .",
    "4 shows the cross section for @xmath4 and @xmath13 mesons produced in @xmath78 collisions and the experimental points from the wa92 experiment @xcite . the corresponding production asymmetry for @xmath4 and @xmath13",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "by looking at the fit of the cross section in fig.4 one can see that the asymmetry obtained for @xmath79 could actually change drastically by slightly changing the curves .",
    "more statistics is needed to improve the confidence of the predicted asymmetry .",
    "in an earlier work @xcite the production asymmetry of @xmath5 was described using the same recombination scheme used here .",
    "the presence of a diquark in the initial state , plays an important role in @xmath5 production .",
    "however , it is not possible to describe the asymmetry in charm mesons using the grv structure functions for the charm in the pion . a hard charm component must be present .",
    "this fact has been pointed out before @xcite but the asymmetry in the intrinsic charm model @xcite does not seem to fit experimental results very well .",
    "the hard charm component proposed in @xcite and a recombination scheme , give a good description of particle anti - particle production asymmetries for mesons .",
