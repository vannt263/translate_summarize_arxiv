    "in the spirit of wheeler and ruffini @xcite it has been conjectured a long time ago that classical stationary black holes can be completely characterized by parameters which are associated to a gauss law .",
    "this  no - hair \" conjecture has been proven in the case of einstein - maxwell theory @xcite and for several types of non - maxwellian matter @xcite . for a long time",
    "all known classical black hole solutions of the einstein field equations did not contradict to this no hair conjecture .",
    "however , from the late 80s on , many classical black hole solutions of the einstein field equations ( with different matter sources ) which were interpreted as black holes with classical primary hair ( not associable to a gauss law ) have been discovered ( see @xcite for some reviews ) .",
    "many of the asymptotically - flat and spherically - symmetric black hole solutions of this kind turned out to be unstable against spherically - symmetric linear perturbations .",
    "the only asymptotically - flat and spherically - symmetric black hole solutions of this kind which are known to be stable against such linear perturbations are some of the black hole solutions where the matter source in the einstein field equations is taken by a topological soliton .",
    "these are first , some of the skyrmion black hole solutions of the einstein - skyrme equations @xcite and second , some of the magnetic monopole black hole solutions of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations @xcite .",
    "therefore , from our knowledge today , it seems that in this sense topology is a necessary condition for spherically - symmetric and asymptotically - flat classical hairy black holes to be stable against linear perturbations .",
    "all these asymptotically - flat and spherically - symmetric hairy classical black hole solutions which are known to be stable against spherically - symmetric linear perturbations have in common that they exist only in a domain of parameters in which the black hole event horizon is located inside the soliton core . in this work we focus on magnetic monopole black holes .",
    "it is not clear a priori if the existence of magnetic monopole black holes , in a certain parameter domain , provides a new primary parameter which has to be taken into account in a complete description of a classical stationary black hole which is stable against linear perturbations .",
    "this is because there exist not only magnetic monopole black hole solutions of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations but also reissner - nordstrm black hole solutions and therefore there are a priori two possible options which - if correct - would both imply that any known non - rotating asymptotically - flat magnetically charged classical black hole solution is uniquely describable by its adm mass and magnetic charge measurable at asymptotic infinity : first , it might be that a given magnetic monopole black hole is uniquely described by its magnetic charge ( and adm mass ) and that such a unique magnetic monopole black hole with given magnetic charge ( and given adm mass ) is described by the same metric than a reissner - nordstrm black hole with same magnetic charge ( and same adm mass ) .",
    "second , it might be that unique magnetic monopole black holes are described by different metrics than the reissner - nordstrm metrics but exist as solutions of the einstein field equations in einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory only in a domain of parameters in which magnetically charged reissner - nordstrm black holes do not exist as black hole solutions of the einstein field equations . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "both options are however not correct .",
    "a magnetic monopole black hole is described by a different metric than a reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "there is a domain of parameters in which magnetic monopole black holes do exist as solutions of the einstein field equations in einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory and there is another domain of parameters in which magnetically charged reissner - nordstrm black hole solutions do exist as solutions of the einstein field equations .",
    "although these two domains of parameters are different , it was shown @xcite that there is an overlapp between these two domains and that for parameter choices in this overlapp , a non - rotating magnetically charged classical black hole can not be uniquely characterized by its adm mass and its magnetic charge .",
    "instead , there is a degeneracy : in this overlapp of the parameter domains , for a given magnetic charge and a given adm mass , there exist different classical stationary black hole configurations with the same asymptotic characteristics but with significantly different geometries in the near - horizon regions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate how one can distinguish stationary classical magnetically charged black holes which have the same asymptotic characteristics but significantly different near - horizon geometries in classical scattering experiments . for this purpose",
    "we study classical scattering cross sections of a massless minimally - coupled probe scalar field scattered by a magnetically charged black hole . for simplicity , in this analysis , we neglect possible non - gravitational interactions between the scalar field and the magnetic monopole .",
    "we find that one can indeed distinguish these stationary black hole configurations which are described by the same set of asymptotic parameters but have different near - horizon geometries by such scattering experiments .",
    "the scattering cross sections of the probe scalar field are different for magnetically charged black holes with same asymptotic characteristics but different near - horizon geometries .",
    "in particular the characteristic glory peaks in the cross sections are located at different scattering angles . in @xcite",
    "analogous scattering cross sections were calculated for skyrmion black holes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly review the aspects of magnetic monopole black holes in einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory which are most relevant for our analysis .",
    "we recapulate how magnetic monopole black holes differ from reissner - nordstrm black holes with same asymptotic characteristics in the part of the parameter domain where both magnetic monopole black holes and reissner - nordstrm black holes do exist as solutions of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations . in section iii",
    "we calculate scattering cross - sections of a massless minimally - coupled probe scalar field scattered by a magnetic monopole black hole .",
    "we both use the glory approximation and a complete partial wave analysis to determine these cross sections . in section",
    "iv we compare these cross sections with the known cross sections of the same scalar field now scattered by a reissner - nordstrm black hole which has the same adm mass and same charge as the magnetic monopole black hole considered in section iii . in section",
    "v we conclude with a summary and an outlook .    for the minkowski metric we use the signature ( + , -,-,- ) .",
    "we use units in which the speed of light is set to one but the newton constant @xmath0 is kept explicit .",
    "in this section we briefly review some aspects of the spherically - symmetric , static and asymptotically - flat classical black hole solutions of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations which can be interpreted as black holes inside t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopoles .",
    "these solutions have been first discovered in @xcite and are often regarded as examples for black holes with classical primary hair @xcite .",
    "we review the domain of parameters for which these black hole solutions have been found and compare this domain of parameters with the parameter domain in which reissner - nordstrm black holes exist as black hole solutions of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations .",
    "the matter lagrangian we consider is the lagrangian of einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory which is given by @xmath1 here @xmath2 @xmath3 where greek indices refer to spacetime indices and latin indices refer to su(2 ) indices .",
    "@xmath4 is the yang - mills gauge coupling constant , @xmath5 is the higgs coupling constant and @xmath6 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs triplett @xmath7 .    in flat spacetime",
    "this lagrangian gives rise to spherically - symmetric solitonic solutions (  t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopoles \" ) @xcite when using the ansatzes @xmath8 and appropriate boundary conditions for the ansatz functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "( here @xmath11 is the @xmath12-th component of the unit vector in radial direction . )",
    "the characteristic size , mass of these magnetic monopoles is given by @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the gravitational radius of a t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole is @xmath14 for later convenience we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 defined as the ratio of @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath18    the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) can be coupled to gravity by using the corresponding energy momentum tensor , @xmath19 as a source @xcite . using the ansatzes ( [ ansatzgauge ] ) for the fields @xmath20 and @xmath7 and for the metric @xmath21 the spherically - symmetric ansatz @xmath22 there are in total the four ansatz functions @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for which the einstein field equations @xmath25 can be solved after choosing appropriate boundary conditions for @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for convenience",

    "we however focus on the solutions with event horizon in this work . ]",
    "these solutions are completely characterized by the boundary conditions of @xmath26 and @xmath10 and by the parameter @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the solutions fall in two clases : first , the following functions solve the field equations ( [ einstein ] ) : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is an arbitrary constant set by the boundary condition @xmath35 which sets the adm mass @xmath36 . in this case",
    ", the metric is of reissner - nordstrm form . for @xmath37 the reissner - nordstrm",
    "metric describes black holes ( configurations with horizon(s ) and without a naked singularity ) .",
    "second , there exists a different type of black hole solutions of the field equations ( [ einstein ] ) (  magnetic monopole black holes \" ) described by a metric which is not of reissner - nordstrm form .",
    "solutions of this type have only been found in a certain domain of parameters .",
    "indeed , there exists a maximal value @xmath38 and this type of black hole solutions have only been found for @xmath39 on top of that , there exists a maximal possible black hole event horizon size @xmath40 and magnetic monopole black holes have only been found when the boundary conditions and parameter @xmath15 are chosen such that @xmath41 from a physical point of view the knowledge of magnetic monopole black holes only within this domain of parameters implies that the event horizon of known magnetic monopole black holes is always located inside the core of the magnetic monopole .    for a more detailed discussion of these black hole solutions as well as for details on the numerical methods used for obtaining them we refer to @xcite .",
    "a phase diagram representing the parameter spaces of both classes of solutions can be found for example in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "as shown in this diagram , there is a part in the parameter space for which both classes of black hole solutions do exist .",
    "( indeed , in this part of the parameter space , for given asymptotic characteristics there is a reissner - nordstrm black hole solution of ( [ einstein ] ) described by a reissner - nordstrm metric which satisfies ( [ massine ] ) and there is a magnetic monopole black hole solution of ( [ einstein ] ) which satisfies ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) and which is described by a metric which is not of reissner - nordstrm form . ) that is the domain of parameters we are interested in this work . to illustrate the following points we choose the point @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 out of this parameter domain as a working example and plot in figure [ fig:1 ] the solution - function @xmath45 for the magnetic monopole black hole solution with these parameters as well as the analogous function for the reissner - nordstrm black hole with same asymptotic characteristics than the magnetic monopole",

    "@xmath50 ( we plot @xmath45 only close to the event horizon in the regime @xmath51 . magnetic monopole black hole solutions in the regime @xmath52 are discussed for example in @xcite . )     in the regime @xmath53 for the metric of a magnetic monopole black hole with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath42 and for a reissner - nordstrm metric with @xmath54 , @xmath44 , @xmath42 ]    from the plot one can see that for our working example the event horizon size of the magnetic monopole black hole is bigger than the event horizon size of the reissner - nordstrm black hole with same asymptotic characteristics than the magnetic monopole black hole and that the shape of the functions @xmath45 significantly differ in the near - horizon regions .",
    "this is not only the case for our working example , but is a generic feature for all magnetic monopole black holes which are characterized by parameters out of the domain of parameters in which also reissner - nordstrm black hole solutions do exist as solutions of the einstein field equations @xcite . for @xmath56 the metrics of magnetic monopole black holes approach the reissner - nordstrm metrics @xcite . for @xmath56 @xcite . ]",
    "we take the magnetic monopole black hole described by the parameters of our working example and study classical scattering cross sections of a massless minimally - coupled probe scalar field @xmath57 scattered by the magnetic monopole black hole .",
    "for simplicity we neglect possible non - gravitational interactions between the magnetic monopole and @xmath57 .",
    "the motion of @xmath57 in the background space - time of a magnetic monopole black hole can be described by the klein - gordon equation , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the dalambert operator in the space - time of a magnetic monopole black hole .    with the expansion @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the standard spherical harmonics",

    "cross sections can therefore be studied by using methods of one - dimensional quantum mechanical scattering theory .    in the following subsections we study scattering cross sections for two monochromatic waves with the two frequencies @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively . in subsection",
    "a , we use the glory approximation to determine the scattering cross sections of high frequency monochromatic waves for scattering angles @xmath71 . in subsection",
    "b we use a partial wave analysis to obtain exact scattering cross sections for the two monochromatic waves with frequencies @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "we use the same methods which have been used frequently for example in studies of classical scattering cross sections in the case of waves scattered by schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes ( see @xcite and references therein and @xcite for some more recent studies ) .       in the background of a magnetic monopole black hole with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath42 ]     in the background of a reissner - nordstrm black hole with @xmath54 , @xmath44 , @xmath42 ]    using a saddle point approximation",
    "it was shown for example in @xcite that the differential scattering cross sections for high frequency scalar plane waves ( @xmath72 ) and for scattering angles @xmath71 can be obtained analytically as @xmath73 here @xmath74 is a bessel function of first kind and @xmath75 is the impact parameter of the ray of a null geodesic in the background of a magnetic monopole black hole which is scattered in the same direction as it came from .",
    "we plot null geodesics for our working example of a magnetic monopole black hole for different impact parameters @xmath76 in figure [ fig:2 ] and find @xmath77 .",
    "we plot the corresponding differential scattering cross sections in figure [ fig:4 ] and figure [ fig:5 ] for the two cases @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "for comparison , we plot null geodesics for the reissner - nordstrm black hole which has the same asymptotic characteristics than the magnetic monopole black hole of our working example in figure [ fig:3 ] . for the null geodesics in this reissner - nordstrm black hole background",
    "we find @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , @xmath81 for our working example . by considering many examples we convinced ourselves that ( [ impact ] ) is not only the case for our working example , but is a generic feature for all magnetic monopole black holes which are characterized by parameters within the domain of parameters in which also reissner - nordstrm black holes exist as solutions of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations .",
    "we did a partial wave analysis to determine the scattering cross sections for our working example . in our working example , for all @xmath82 , @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath85 for @xmath84 as @xmath86 with the two complex coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 . for @xmath89 we choose the boundary condition @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a complex coefficient which satisfies @xmath92 . with this boundary condition",
    "we describe a monochromatic wave ( coming from infinity ) which is purely ingoing .",

    "we plot the results for our working example in figure [ fig:6 ] and figure [ fig:7 ] for the two frequencies @xmath69 , @xmath70 respectively .",
    "one can see from these figures that in the case of our working example the differential scattering cross sections are different for the black holes with same asymptotic characteristics but different near - horizon geometries . in particular , the characteristic  glory \" peaks in the cross sections of the scalar field scattered by magnetic monopole black holes are located at bigger scattering angles than the analogous peaks in the differential scattering cross sections of the same scalar field scattered by a reissner - nordstrm black hole with same asymptotic characteristics than the magnetic monopole black hole .",
    "this is not only true for our working example , but is a generic feature of all differential scattering cross sections caused by a minimally coupled massless probe scalar field scattered by any magnetic monopole black hole which is characterized by parameters within the domain of parameters in which also reissner - nordstrm black holes do exist as solutions of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations . for the glory peaks located at scattering angles @xmath71",
    "this is a direct consequence of ( [ gloryapprox ] ) and the fact that ( [ impact ] ) is generic for all such magnetic monopole black holes .    since for @xmath56 the metric of a magnetic monopole black hole approaches the reissner - nordstrm metric @xcite , the differential scattering cross sections of a wave scattered by a magnetic monopole black hole becomes indistinguishable from the scattering cross section of the same wave scattered by a reissner - nordstrm black hole with the same asymptotic characteristics than the magnetic monopole black hole when @xmath56 .",
    "in this work we studied classical differential scattering cross sections of a massless minimally coupled probe scalar field scattered by a magnetic monopole black hole .",
    "we compared these differential scattering cross sections with the analogous scattering cross sections of the same scalar field scattered by a reissner - nordstrm black holes which has the same asymptotic characteristics than the magnetic monopole black hole but a different near - horizon geometry .",
    "we found that the cross sections are different , in particular the characteristic glory peaks are located at different scattering angles .",
    "this implies that one can use scalar waves to probe near - horizon regions of black holes in order to experimentally distinguish magnetically charged black holes with same asymptotic characteristics but different near - horizon geometries .",
    "similar results were obtained in @xcite for skyrmion black holes .",
    "we worked in the limit ( [ limit ] ) and did not take into account possible non - gravitational interactions between the probe scalar field and the t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole .",
    "going beyond ( [ limit ] ) and taking into account such non - gravitational interactions requires further study .",
    "this work , as well as the similar analysis in @xcite for skyrmion black holes , opens up many new possible directions for further studies .",
    "first , it might be interesting ( instead of considering a massless minimally - coupled scalar field ) to consider different kinds of waves , for example waves with higher spins , and to do a similar analysis for such different kind of waves .",
    "second , one can study absorption cross sections of waves scattered by magnetic monopole black holes or skyrmion black holes .",
    "( such an analysis would be similar to the analysis done in @xcite where absorption cross sections of dirty black holes - also parametrized by a metric of the form ( [ ansatzmetric ] ) - were studied . )",
    "third , one might not only consider magnetic monopole black holes or skyrmion black holes but also black holes with different kind of classical hair such as the skyrmion magnetic monopole black holes @xcite or the recently discovered kerr black holes with scalar hair @xcite .",
    "fourth , one might study the scattering cross sections ( which we studied in this work only classically ) also quantum mechanically .",
    "indeed , quantum effects might be important in particular since for realistic parameters both the magnetic monopole black holes and the skyrmion black holes are known as solutions of the einstein field equations only in a domain of parameters in which these hairy black holes are microscopically small .",

    "in this appendix we provide the field equations obtained by plugging the ansatzes ( [ ansatzgauge ] ) , ( [ ansatzgauge2 ] ) , ( [ ansatzmetric ] ) , ( [ ansatzmetric2 ] ) in the einstein field equations ( [ einstein ] ) .",

    "<S> we show that one way to probe the near - horizon region of a black hole which allows to distinguish magnetically charged black holes with same asymptotic characteristics but different near - horizon geometries is by classical scattering of waves . </S>",
    "<S> using the example of a minimally - coupled massless probe scalar field scattered by a magnetically charged black hole , we find that the scattering cross sections are different for magnetically charged black holes with different near - horizon geometries but same asymptotic characteristics . </S>",
