    "one of the fundamental tasks of galactic astronomy is the determination of the mass and luminosity distributions of the milky way . in the 1950s",
    "the development of radio astronomy opened up the study of the galaxy s large - scale structure , and much of the understanding that was attained at that time was summarized by schmidt s ( 1956 ) mass model . in the 1970s and",
    "early 1980s our picture of the milky way changed in response both to studies of external galaxies and to a growing awareness of the existence of `` dark matter '' at large radii .",
    "these developments were reflected in the bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) , caldwell & ostriker ( 1981 ) and rohlfs & kreitschmann ( 1988 ) galaxy models .",
    "these models were based on two rather different methodologies : whereas bahcall & soneira concentrated on fitting the distribution of _ luminosity _ within the galaxy by fitting star counts , caldwell & ostriker and rohlfs & kreitschmann concentrated on fitting various measures of the galactic gravitational force - field .",
    "never the less , all these models decompose the galaxy into `` components '' that are motivated by photometric studies of external galaxies , and incorporated a range of dynamical constraints .",
    "it is our aim in this and subsequent papers to update and extend these models .",
    "the principal direction in which we wish to extend traditional galaxy models is the incorporation of kinematic information that is capable of constraining the degree of flattening of the mass distribution .",
    "the kinematic information that has traditionally been used to constrain galaxy models  the shape of the circular - speed curve , the values of the oort constants , etc  relates almost exclusively to the radial force within the plane .",
    "such information is in principle incapable of determining how much of the galaxy s mass lies near the plane , which is clearly of prime importance astrophysically .",
    "this deficit of kinematic information has been papered over in two ways .",
    "the first is a one - dimensional analysis of the vertical structure of the disk along the lines pioneered by oort ( 1932 ) .",
    "such analyses ultimately come up against the problem that the vertical and horizontal motions of stars do not decouple to the necessary degree , so that a one - dimensional analysis can not precisely determine the vertical distribution of matter ",
    "see , e.g. , kuijken & gilmore ( 1991 ) .",
    "the second way in which the deficit of kinematic constraints on the galaxy s vertical structure has been papered over is to use star counts to constrain the flattening of the components into which the overall luminosity density is decomposed , and to assume that each component @xmath10 is characterized by a constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath11 .",
    "this procedure is methodologically questionable since it appears to presume that the phenomenon of `` dark matter '' implies the existence of a completely dark component comprised of exotic particles , whereas it may merely reflect the variation from point to point of each @xmath11 .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers in which we plan to overcome these difficulties by treating the orbits of stars in the meridional plane with sufficient sophistication .",
    "our approach , which has been described elsewhere ( binney 1994 , dehnen & binney 1996 ) , is iterative : we choose a potential , determine a range of orbits in this potential , populate these with stars of various spectral types and then compare the resulting predictions with the available surveys .",
    "the potential is modified in the light of this comparison .",
    "thus our first step is to choose potentials ( and thus , implicitly , mass models ) which are compatible with all the standard kinematic and photometric constraints .",
    "this task of updating the caldwell & ostriker and rohlfs & kreitschmann models is even now by no means trivial , as is made apparent by recent divergent results ( gates , gyuk & turner , 1995 ; cowsik , ratnam & bhattacharjee , 1996 ; evans 1996 ) . therefore we believe it will be useful to present in this paper our initial mass models and the consider actions upon which they are based .",
    "computer programs for evaluating the density and potential of the models are available upon request to the authors .",
    "although there is now abundant evidence that the inner galaxy is significantly non - axisymmetric , our model conforms to the traditional axisymmetric pattern because the success of axisymmetric models in accounting for observations in the 21-cm line of hydrogen at longitudes @xmath12 suggests that orbits in the galactic potential that carry stars to radii @xmath13 can be accurately modelled by orbits in an axisymmetric potential .",
    "we do not distinguish between the visible halo , of which rr - lyrae stars and metal - poor globular clusters are classical tracers , and the putative dark halo : since we do not understand why the mass - to - light ratio rises with galactocentric radius @xmath14 , we are at liberty to assume that the galaxy possesses a single , massive halo that simply becomes more luminous with decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "our mass model contains three principal components : the disk , the bulge and the halo .",
    "our disk is made up of three components , namely the ism , and the thin and thick stellar disks .",
    "the density of each sub - disk is given by [ rho - disk ] _",
    "( r , z ) = ( --- ) , with @xmath15 , equation ( [ rho - disk ] ) describes a standard double exponential disk with scale - length @xmath16 , scale - height @xmath17 and central surface - density @xmath18 .",
    "since there appears to be very little interstellar gas between the molecular ring at @xmath19-@xmath20 and the nuclear disk at @xmath21 ( dame  1987 ) , there should be a depression in the central surface - density of the ism .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 in equation ( [ rho - disk ] ) allows for such a central depression .",
    "we set @xmath15 for the stellar disks and adopt @xmath23 for the ism .",
    "the total mass of a disk with density ( [ rho - disk ] ) is [ mass - disk ] m_= 4 _ r_m r _",
    "k_2(2 ) , where @xmath24 is a modified bessel function . for @xmath15",
    "this gives @xmath25 .",
    "table [ tab - disk ] gives our adopted values of the scale heights of the three sub - disks as well as the fraction of the whole disk s surface density at @xmath1 which is contributed by each sub - disk .",
    "as can also be seen from this table , we fix the ratios between the sub - disk s scale - lengths .",
    "the value of @xmath26 , the scale length of the stellar disk , and the mass of the whole disk are obtained from least - squared fits to the observational constraints to be discussed below .",
    ".fixed parameters of the disk components [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is not clear that a massive halo should be nearly round ( axis ratio @xmath27 ) as in all the models described above , so model 2i explores the effect of assuming that the halo is highly flattened : axis ratio @xmath28 .",
    "this has the effect of making the halo virtually a pure power - law component that is dynamicaly dominant at all radii .",
    "consequently , it predicts that the rotation curve rises at the very largest radii .",
    "the massive , flattened halo contributes strongly to @xmath29 , so that the target value of @xmath29 is significantly overshot , despite the local disk surface density , @xmath30 , being pushed right down to its floor value , @xmath31 . for this model @xmath32",
    "is on the high side .",
    "models 4a  4i explore the effect on model 4 of the changes that were made to model 2 in making models 2a  2i .",
    "qualitatively the results are similar , but quantitatively they tend to be smaller because the halo is very much more important in model 4 than it is in model 2 and the effects of changes in the disk and bulge are relatively minor",
    ".    inspection of table [ tab - best - fit ] shows that there is a general anticorrelation between the steepness of the halo s central density profile and the bulge mass .",
    "in particular , when the halo density is strongly cusped at the centre @xmath33 ) , the bulge mass is small : @xmath34 .",
    "conversely , with the exception of the model with the smallest value of @xmath35 , the bulge mass is large ( @xmath36 ) when the halo has a hole at its centre ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the asymptotic slope of the halo profile at large @xmath38 is always larger than @xmath39 and no model has a finite halo cut - off radius @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the data imply only that the halo ends at @xmath41 .",
    "the only models that comes near to violating the lower limit ( [ local - sigma - nod ] ) on the local column density are model 1 , which has the smallest disc scale - length , model 2h , which is obliged to have a massive bulge , and models 2i and 4i , which have highly flattened halos .",
    "table [ tab - correl ] gives the correlation matrix of the fitted parameters for both models 2 and 4 : the upper right triangle is for model 2 while the lower - left triangle is for model 4 .",
    "the parameters of the halo are strongly correlated with one another .",
    "indeed , the halo s density normalization @xmath42 , central slope @xmath43 and scale length @xmath44 have almost unit correlations between them . the density normalization of the bulge , @xmath45 is strongly correlated with all the halo parameters , especially @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath46 . by contrast , @xmath47 is only weakly correlated with the other parameters .",
    "these strong correlations between parameters reflect the existence of a long , level valley in parameter space .",
    "we have fitted a multiparameter mass model to the available kinematic data for the milky way .",
    "the wide variety of models that emerge from this fitting process demonstrates that the mass distribution within the milky way is currently ill determined .",
    "the principal problem in determining the galaxy s mass distribution is that very few hard facts are available regarding the vertical distribution of the galaxy s mass .",
    "also the circular speed is observationally much less well constrained at @xmath9 than it is at @xmath48 .",
    "these deficiencies in the spatial coverage of the data have several unfortunate effects",
    ". first they oblige use to represent the galaxy as a superposition of components , and to adopt simple functional forms for the distribution of mass within each component .",
    "the assumed distribution of mass within the halo plays a particularly important and confusing role .",
    "since we know nothing about the halo except what can be gleaned from studies such as this , we have allowed the halo density as much freedom as is compatible with ( i ) its being much thicker than the disk ( axis ratio @xmath49 ) , ( ii ) its density function containing only a few free parameters , and ( iii ) its not being implausibly sharp - edged ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .    with these assumptions we find that even the circular - speed curve of the best - fitting model depends significantly on both the adopted values of parameters such as @xmath52 and @xmath1 , and on the adopted functional forms of the components .",
    "the density model is even less well constrained by the data .",
    "in particular , remarkably small changes in @xmath2 and the other observational constraints can be associated with dramatic changes in the distribution of mass between the different components , and the degree of central concentration of the halo .",
    "a particularly disturbing phenomenon is that a change in a component that contributes to @xmath7 only at small radii causes the predicted value of @xmath7 to change at large radii .",
    "this connection between small and large scales within the galaxy is established by the halo component , which must be allowed to contribute to the density at all radii and yet be determined by a small number of parameters . in general there is a clear need to model components non - parametrically or at least by functions that contain more parameters .",
    "however , we do not yet have enough observational constraints to constrain adequately models that are significantly more complex than those used here .",
    "as is traditional , we have represented the galaxy as a superposition of components that individually represent plausible stellar systems .",
    "the justification for the use of such components in preference to a family of orthogonal ( and therefore non - positive ) functions , is the hypothesis that these components do , in fact , represent real physical systems .",
    "while there can be no doubt of the reality of the disk and bulge , the status of the halo is entirely speculative .",
    "indeed , although observations of external galaxies clearly require high mass - to - light ratios at large radii , it does not follow that these reflect the existence of a physically distinct dark halo ; it is perfectly possible that the mass - to - light ratio of the disk or bulge increases strongly away from the galactic centre . if the halo does represent a distinct dynamical entity , then in an exercise like the present one it should emerge with a dynamically plausible density profile . table [ tab - best - fit ] shows that it frequently fails this test : in just over half the models , the central density slope @xmath43 lies at one or other extreme of its permitted range @xmath53 . in four models ( models 3 , 2a , f , i )",
    "the halo s density profile is an essentially featureless power law of slope @xmath54 . in seven models",
    "the halo has a hole at its centre .",
    "@xmath55-body simulations of structure formation offer no encouragement to the idea that the galaxy s distribution of axions or other exotic particles would have a hole at its centre .",
    "nor do they suggest that it should be a featureless power law ( navarro .",
    ".    the road to an improved understanding of the galaxy s mass distribution must lie with the introduction of more observational constraints , especially ones that relate to @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the goal of later papers in this series is to bring to bear on this problem observations of halo stars , which should provide a wealth of information about the density at @xmath8 , and , to a lesser extent , about the density at @xmath9 .",
    "the models described here simultaneously provide starting points for this enterprise and demonstrate its urgency by underlining that at the present time we know depressingly little about the distribution of mass within our own galaxy .",
