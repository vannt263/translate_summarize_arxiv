    "multi - modal objective functions pose difficulties for local search and derivative based methods .",
    "our simulation - based approach exploits a well - known duality between functional optimisation and sampling to find the mode of the boltzmann distribution with an energy potential specified by the objective function of interest .",
    "we exploit auxiliary slice variables to augment the state space and develop a markov chain which samples uniformly on the slice region whilst traversing the desired modes in the original space .",
    "a simulation - based approach has the advantage of being derivative free and thus avoids some of the problems associated with optimisation of multi - modal functions . to illustrate our methodology , we test four standard global functions from the optimisation literature : the rosenbrock , himmelblau , rastrigin , and shubert .",
    "our approach builds on the seminal work of pincus ( 1968 , 1970 ) , geman and geman ( 1985 ) , and geman ( 1990 ) who proposed simulation - based metropolis - hastings ( mh ) algorithms for boltzmann distributions in the context of constrained functional optimisation .",
    "we use a slice sampling approach for additive functionals ( edwards and sokal , 1988 ) that scales to high dimensions .",
    "the boltzmann distribution contains an energy level parameter which we can use to perform a sensitivity analysis .",
    "subsequent research has shown that direct mcmc methods can be fraught with convergence difficulties as the associated chain can easily become stuck in a local mode ; consequentially , careful tuning of algorithms is generally required .",
    "one of the advantages of our approach is that it does not require additional tuning . for the algorithm to be efficient the chain has to have good mixing properties ; see ,",
    "tweedie and mengersen ( 1994 ) , polson ( 1996 ) and roberts and rosenthal ( 1999 ) , mira and tierney ( 2002 ) for theoretical convergence results on slice sampling . from a practical perspective , in the four examples considered here",
    ", our slice sampler has remarkably good mixing properties as it samples uniformly over the higher dimensional slice region . in all cases , with a reasonable set of energy levels",
    ", we can traverse the objective functions of interest within thousands of mcmc draws .",
    "other popular simulation - based methods range from simulated annealing ( kirkpatrick et al , 1983 , geman , 1990 ) , direct and evolutionary metropolis mcmc ( liu , et al , 2000 ) , particle swarm ( kennedy and eberhart , 1995 ) , multi - set sampling ( leman , chen and lavine , 1999 ) , and stochastic guided search ( gramacy and taddy , 2010 , gramacy and lee , 2010 , taddy , lee , gray and griffin , 2008 ) .",
    "for example , janson and middendorf ( 2005 ) illustrate particle swarm methods on the rosenbrock and rastigin functions .",
    "many of these methods require careful tuning .",
    "our approach relies solely on the energy level as a free tuning parameter and requires only a sensitivity analysis to this parameter .",
    "we follow the simulated tempering literature by focusing on a set of pre - determined energy values although our method extends easily to the case of stochastic levels as used in the wang landau algorithm    the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our simulation - based optimisation procedure .",
    "section 3 develops slice samplers for the rosenbrock , himmelblau , rastrigin , and shubert functions .",
    "we show how to calculate the slice - set for each of the functions in turn and develop the associated mcmc algorithms .",
    "finally , section 4 concludes with directions for future research .",
    "the general problem we address is to find the set of minima @xmath0 , for some domain @xmath1 for a given objective @xmath2 .",
    "this is the standard optimisation problem .",
    "our method distinguishes itself from others in that we allow for the function @xmath2 to be multi - modal .",
    "we define the set of minima by @xmath3 we will find @xmath4 by simulation , however , we do not directly simulate @xmath2 , rather we exploit a well - known duality between optimisation and finding the modes of the boltzmann distribution with energy potential @xmath2 defined by the density @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an appropriate normalisation constant or partition function .",
    "clearly the minima of @xmath2 correspond to the modes of @xmath7 .",
    "one advantage of our simulation approach is that we do not require explicit knowledge of @xmath8 .",
    "the only tuning parameter is @xmath9 which is an energy level parameter of the boltzmann distribution .",
    "the limiting cases of the boltzmann distribution where @xmath10 or @xmath11 are of particular interest . they both lead to a uniform measure but on different sets . when @xmath10 , the limiting distribution , denoted by @xmath12 , is a uniform measure on the set @xmath1 . when @xmath13 , the limiting distribution , denoted by @xmath14 , is a uniform measure on the set of modes , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , if we can sample from the boltzmann distribution we can identify the minima of the original function . specifically",
    ", we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes a dirac measure .",
    "once our problem is re - written in terms of the boltzmann distribution we can extend existing methods for finding the modes .",
    "for example , pincus ( 1968 , 1970 ) proposed a metropolis algorithm to simulate draws .",
    "we denote the realisation of the markov chain by @xmath18 which has equilibrium distribution , @xmath19 .",
    "then , under mild harris recurrence conditions , given any starting point @xmath20 and energy level @xmath9 , we have the limit @xmath21 for any borel sets @xmath22 .",
    "see tierney ( 1994 ) and azencott ( 1988 ) for further discussion .",
    "we can then use the ergodic mean @xmath23 along the chain as an estimate of the mean and hence , in the uni - modal case as @xmath13 this will find the mode .",
    "there are , however , many possible markov transition dynamics that have the appropriate equilibrium distribution .",
    "thus the main issue becomes which markov chain to use .",
    "we argue for the use of slice sampling methods .",
    "the practical insight of using augmentation and slice sampling is that essentially we have put some volume back into the spiky multi - mode regions .",
    "after the chain has converged in the higher dimensional set , we can project the draws back down into the dimension of interest and the chain will have no difficulty in traversing the modes even for lower energy values .      in this section",
    "we describe the developments in slice sampling and then show how to apply them to our optimisation problem .",
    "suppose that we wish to sample from a possibly high dimensional un - normalised density @xmath24 .",
    "we do this by sampling uniformly from the region that lies under the density plot of @xmath25 .",
    "this idea is formalised by letting @xmath26 be an auxiliary `` slice - variable '' and defining a joint distribution @xmath27 that is uniform on the set @xmath28 . therefore ,",
    "@xmath29 on @xmath30 and zero otherwise . here",
    "@xmath31 is the appropriate normalisation constant .",
    "the marginal is the desired normalised density as @xmath32 we are then left with sampling from the uniform density on @xmath30 .",
    "neal ( 2003 ) provides a general slice algorithm .",
    "when it is straightforward to sample from the `` slice '' region defined by @xmath26 , namely @xmath33 , then a simple gibbs sampler which iterates between drawing a uniform @xmath34 and @xmath35 provides a markov chain with the joint distribution @xmath36 and hence we can obtain marginal draws from @xmath37 .",
    "the swenden - wang algorithm ( edwards and sokal , 1988 ) extends the application of slice sampling to product functionals .",
    "suppose that we wish to sample from a density that is a product of functions : @xmath38 to do this , we introduce @xmath39 auxiliary uniform slice variables @xmath40 with a joint @xmath41 defined to be uniform on the `` slice '' region : @xmath42 the marginal distribution @xmath43 .",
    "we can sample this distribution using the complete conditionals @xmath44 where @xmath45",
    ".    we will be interested in additive objective functions : @xmath46 .",
    "define @xmath47 .",
    "now the boltzmann distribution is @xmath48 the exponential slice sampler extends slice sampling to additive functionals by letting @xmath49 be a vector of exponential variables with @xmath50 .",
    "the joint distribution is given by : @xmath51 the mcmc algorithm uses the complete conditional @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 the auxiliary variables are sampled from @xmath55 .",
    "so far we have constructed a markov chain on the augmented space @xmath56 which converges in distribution to @xmath57 : we write @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "given weak convergence , we also have for any functional that @xmath60 hence we can project that joint draws back to the original space and view @xmath61 as traversing the boltzmann funcion or equivalently @xmath2 .",
    "this allows us to traverse the modes of interest and has the advantage of scalability in @xmath39 .",
    "a related approach is to allow the energy level , @xmath9 , to be random .",
    "one places pseudo - prior weights , denoted by @xmath62 , and simulates the mixture boltzmann distribution @xmath63 .",
    "another line of research is based on simulated annealing ( kirkpatrick et al , 1983 , aarts and korst , 1988 , van laarhoven and aarts , 1987 ) which increases the energy level with the length of simulation in an appropriate schedule ( gidas , 1985 ) .",
    "other approaches that randomize @xmath9 include multi - canonical sampling ( berg and neuhaus , 1982 ) , simulated tempering ( marinari and parisi , 1992 , geyer and thompson , 1995 ) uses a random walk on a set of energy level , equi - energy sampling ( kou , zhou and wong , 2006 ) , evolutionary mcmc ( liu , liang and wong , 2000 , 2001 ) and the wang - landau algorithm ( liang , 2005 , atchade and liu , 2010 ) and when @xmath64 is bounded and @xmath65 , slice sampler has the added property of geometric convergence ( roberts and polson , 1994 ) and uniformity ( mira and tierney , 2002 ) .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show contour and drape - plots of the rosenbrock , himmelblau , rastigrin and shubert functions .",
    "this set of functions exhibits a variety of challenges : a global mode in a long valley ( rosenbrock ) , multiple local and one global mode ( rastrigin ) to multi - modality ( himmelblau , shubert ) .",
    "for example , traditional derivative - based methods have difficulties for the rosenbrock function to traverse its long steep valley .",
    "let @xmath66 be a bivariate additive objective function defined over a bounded region for @xmath67 .",
    "we will apply the exponential slice sampler as the functions to the boltzmann distribution @xmath68 first , as in simulated tempering , we have to define a set of temperatures @xmath69 to run our markov chain . for all four examples ,",
    "we pick @xmath70 , and we use @xmath71 except for the rosenbrock function where we set @xmath72 which requires higher energy levels .",
    "rosenbrock s valley is a classic optimization problem that illustrates the difficulties with local search methods .",
    "the global minimum lays inside a long , narrow flat valley . finding",
    "the valley is straightforward ; however , getting to the minimum is hard .",
    "we need to find the minimum @xmath73 of the function : @xmath74 the boltzmann distribution has density @xmath75 there are a number of ways of introducing slice variables .",
    "we choose to slice out the last nonlinear factor .",
    "let @xmath76 .",
    "then we have a three variable joint distribution : @xmath77 we can implement mcmc using a partially collapsed gibbs sampler ( van dyk and park , 2008 , park and van dyk , 2009 ) .",
    "that is , we can marginalise @xmath26 out of the draw for @xmath78 and use the conditional @xmath79 rather than @xmath80 .",
    "the complete conditionals are then : @xmath81 the interval @xmath82 is found by inverting the slice region : @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 and so @xmath87 figure 3 shows a sensitivity analysis for a range of energy values @xmath72 .",
    "we run our mcmc algorithm for @xmath88 with a burn - in of @xmath89 .",
    "higher energy levels are required for the chain to travel along the valley to the minimum at @xmath73 .",
    "as we increase @xmath90 , the slice sampler is able to traverse the valley and find the minimum .",
    "himmelblau s function is defined by @xmath91 this function has four identical local minima at zero and a local maximum at @xmath92 .",
    "the minima are at @xmath93 with a function value of zero .",
    "the associated boltzmann distribution is @xmath94 due to the quadratic terms also containing squares this distribution is not straightforward to simulate from .",
    "we observe that the following inequalities hold for the minima : @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "to implement slice sampling , we use a latent variable augmentation @xmath97 and a joint distribution @xmath98 given @xmath99 , we can invert the slice regions to obtain the inequalities : @xmath100 therefore , for @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 given the inequalities : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we can first without loss of generality replace @xmath105 and assume that @xmath106 .",
    "then , we have the union of the following regions : @xmath107 combining , we have @xmath108 for the conditional @xmath109 we can argue in a similar fashion to obtain the constraints @xmath110 the complete set of conditionals is then given by : @xmath111 figure 4 shows a sensitivity analysis to @xmath112 .",
    "the slice sampler is again run for only @xmath88 iterations with a burn - in of @xmath89 . with longer chains and larger energy levels",
    "the algorithm will traverse the four modes with equal probability .",
    "of the examples that we consider here , the himmleblau function would benefit the most from a mixture energy level distribution to traverse the contours of the underlying function .",
    "the @xmath113-dimensional rastrigin function is defined on the region @xmath114 by : @xmath115 with a global minimum at @xmath116 .",
    "the boltzmann distribution then becomes @xmath117 we use exponential slice variables @xmath118 and a joint distribution defined by @xmath119 the slice region is invertible and is specified by the set of inequalities for @xmath120 @xmath121 the conditional @xmath122 draw then results from a normal draw restricted to this interval set .",
    "a gibbs sampler with the conditionals for @xmath123 is as follows : @xmath124 for the implementation over @xmath125 $ ] , we draw the truncated normals and truncated exponentials for the slice variables .",
    "figure 5 shows a sensitivity analysis to @xmath112 with @xmath88 and a burn - in of @xmath89 . again",
    "slice sampling of the boltzmann distribution finds the mode in a straightforward manner .",
    "the shubert function is defined within the domain @xmath126 by @xmath127 we need to simulate from the boltzmann distribution @xmath128 for the conditional @xmath129 , we can write @xmath130 we introduce a set of auxiliary slice variables @xmath131 for each @xmath132 that are conditional exponentials .",
    "the corresponding joint is : @xmath133 this is inverted using the condition : @xmath134 this gives a collection of intervals @xmath135 for @xmath136 for each of the slice variables ; @xmath137 is then uniformly distributed over the intersection of these intervals , @xmath138 .",
    "hence we can then run a gibbs sampler with the conditionals , for @xmath136 : @xmath139 similarly , this process is repeated for @xmath140 .",
    "this defines a @xmath141-dimensional gibbs sampler that is able to traverse the joint distribution .",
    "figure 6 shows a sensitivity analysis to the same set of energy levels used for the rastgrin and himmleblau functions , namely @xmath112 . again",
    "the projected draws from the uniform slice region traverse the modes of the associated boltzmann distribution in an efficient manner .",
    "we have described how slice sampling methods can be applied to functional optimisation . our approach is parallelisable as in slice sampling ( tibbits et al , 2011 ) . while we have only considered four test functions our methodology applies to a multitude of multi - modal functions , see molga and smutnicki ( 2005 ) for a list of possible candidates .",
    "our approach is flexible enough to handle additive functions that are multiplicative .",
    "for example , the michalewicz function is defined by @xmath142 with @xmath143 ( see yang , 2010a , b ) .",
    "this function has a minimum of @xmath144 at the point @xmath145 and it is challenge to fix the minimum .",
    "we also note that certain functions are straightforward as the boltzmann distribution is conditionally normal .",
    "for example , the booth function defined by @xmath146 has a minimum of zero at the point @xmath147 .",
    "the minimum can be identified without resorting to simulation as the booth function can be factorised into the quadratic form @xmath148 where @xmath149 with @xmath150 and @xmath151 . therefore",
    ", the minimum can be immediately identified without resorting to simulation .",
    "there are clearly many other applications of these methods .",
    "for example , simulated annealing methods have been proposed in mixed integer non - linear programming problems ( cardoso et al , 1997 ) and in constrained optimisation ( geman and geman , 1985 , geman , 1990 , whittle , 1992 , birge and louveaux , 1997 , mueller , 2000 , asmussen and glynn , 2008 ) .",
