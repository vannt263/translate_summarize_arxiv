    "the detection of a parity - odd component of the cmb polarization , called b - mode , can provide a unique tool to probe sub - dominant sources of cmb perturbations , which are primarily due to scalar energy - density fluctuations .",
    "scalar perturbations do not produce b polarization , which is only excited by either tensor or vector modes @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to identify all potential sources of b polarization .",
    "a significant background of b - modes comes from the effect of gravitational lensing on the cmb by the matter distribution , which transforms e into b polarization @xcite .",
    "cosmological gravitational waves , as those predicted by inflationary models of the early universe , would also imprint b - polarization upon the cmb .",
    "it has been pointed out that the signature of an inflationary gravitational - wave background can only be detected by b - polarization measurements if the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath3 , which corresponds to an energy scale of inflation larger than @xmath4 gev @xcite , because otherwise their effect would be obscured by the weak lensing background .",
    "quite recently , however , a better technique to _ clean _ polarization maps from the lensing effect has been proposed , which would allow tensor - to - scalar ratios as low as @xmath5 , or even smaller , to be probed @xcite .",
    "other secondary contributions to the b - type polarization arising during the reionization stage , though of much smaller amplitude , have been considered in @xcite .",
    "b - modes of polarization are also produced by secondary vector and tensor modes generated by the non - linear evolution of primordial scalar perturbations @xcite .",
    "primordial magnetic fields can also generate b - mode polarization upon the cmb , due to the vorticity they induce upon the photon - baryon fluid @xcite .",
    "we will consider here another source of b - type polarization , that is the faraday rotation in a magnetic field of initial e - type polarization . if a primordial magnetic field is present at the time of the last scattering of the microwave photons , it causes faraday rotation of the direction of the linear polarization @xcite , which generates b - modes from initial e - modes of polarization @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a cross - correlation between the parity - odd b - modes generated by faraday rotation and the parity - even temperature anisotropies @xmath6 was estimated under simplifying approximations .",
    "@xmath6-b or e - b correlations also exist if there are other parity violating processes , for instance in the case in which the vorticity in the photon - baryon fluid is induced by helical magnetic fields generated by parity - violating electroweak interactions @xcite , or if parity - violating interactions additional to those in the standard electroweak theory exist @xcite .",
    "large scale magnetic fields have been observed in galaxies , clusters and superclusters , but their origin is still unknown @xcite .",
    "they may have formed from dynamo amplification of a small initial seed field @xcite , or alternatively they can arise from the adiabatic compression during structure formation of a cosmological field of order @xmath7 g today @xcite . the existence of these very large scale cosmological fields , although is not excluded by present observations , is difficult to be determined observationally .",

    "we evaluate the effect of faraday rotation upon the cross correlation @xmath6-e and the induced correlation @xmath6-b .",
    "we then calculate , to first order in the faraday rotation effect , the angular correlation function of the b - modes induced by faraday rotation of scalar e - modes of polarization in a standard cosmological model , and compare it with that due to other potential sources of b - modes , namely weak gravitational lensing , gravitational waves , and the effect of faraday rotation due to magnetic fields in clusters @xcite .",
