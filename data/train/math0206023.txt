    "our starting point is a wrong lemma of mike freedman in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  2 ) , dating back before his proof of the @xmath2-dimensional topological poincar conjecture . to formulate the question",
    ", we need the following    a knot in 3-space has _ minimal seifert rank _ if it has a seifert surface whose genus equals the rank of the seifert form .",
    "since the seifert form minus its transpose gives the ( nonsingular ) intersection form on the seifert surface , it follows that the genus is indeed the smallest possible rank of a seifert form .",
    "the formula which computes the alexander polynomial in terms of the seifert form shows that knots with minimal seifert rank have trivial alexander polynomial .",
    "wrong lemma claims that the converse is also true .",
    "however , in the argument he overlooks the problem that s - equivalence does _ not _ preserve the condition of minimal seifert rank .",
    "it turns out that not just the argument , but also the statement of the lemma is wrong .",
    "this has been overlooked for more than 20 years , maybe because none of the classical knot invariants can distinguish the subtle difference between trivial alexander polynomial and minimal seifert rank .    in the last decade ,",
    "knot theory was overwhelmed by a plethora of new `` quantum''invariants , most notably the homfly polynomial ( specializing to the alexander and the jones polynomials ) , and the kontsevich integral . despite their rich structure ,",
    "it is not clear how strong these invariants are for solving open problems in low dimensional topology .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide one such application .",
    "there are knots with trivial alexander polynomial which do nt have minimal seifert rank .",
    "more precisely , the 2-loop part of the kontsevich integral induces an epimorphism @xmath3 from the monoid of knots with trivial alexander polynomial , onto an _ infinitely generated _ abelian group , such that @xmath3 vanishes on knots with minimal seifert rank .",
    "the easiest counterexample is shown in figure  [ fig.example ] , drawn using surgery on a clasper .",
    "surgery on a clasper is a refined form of dehn surgery ( along an embedded trivalent graph , rather than an embedded link ) which we explain in section [ sec.claspers ] .",
    "clasper surgery is an elegant way of drawing knots that amplifies the important features of our example suppressing irrelevant information ( such as the large number of crossings of the resulting knot ) .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig.example ] , if one pulls the central edge of the clasper out of the visible seifert surface , one obtains an s - equivalence to a nontrivial knot with minimal seifert rank .",
    "@xmath4    all of the above notions make sense for knots in homology spheres .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ thm.main ] works in that setting , too .",
    "since ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) was the starting point of what eventually became freedman s theorem that all knots with trivial alexander polynomial are topologically slice , we should make sure that the above counterexamples to his lemma do nt cause any problems in this important theorem .",
    "fortunately , an argument independent of the wrong lemma can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) , see also @xcite .",
    "however , it uses unnecessarily the surgery exact sequence and some facts from @xmath5-theory .    in an appendix",
    ", we shall give a more direct proof that alexander polynomial  1 knots are topologically slice .",
    "we use no machinery , except for a single application of freedman s main disk embedding theorem @xcite in @xmath6 . to satisfy the assumptions of this theorem",
    ", we employ a triangular base change for the intersection form of the complement of a seifert surface in @xmath6 , which works for all alexander polynomial  1 knots . by theorem  [ thm.main ] , this base change does _ not _ work on the level of seifert forms , as freedman possibly tried to anticipate .",
    "the typical list of knot invariants that might find its way into a text book or survey talk on _ classical _ knot theory , would contain the alexander polynomial , ( twisted ) signatures , ( twisted ) arf invariants , and maybe knot determinants .",
    "it turns out that all of these invariants can be computed from the homology of the infinite cyclic covering of the knot complement .",
    "in particular , they all vanish if the alexander polynomial is trivial .",
    "this condition also implies that certain `` noncommutative '' knot invariants vanish , namely all those calculated from the homology of _ solvable _ coverings of the knot complement , like the casson - gordon invariants @xcite or the von neumann signatures of @xcite .",
    "in fact , the latter are concordance invariants and , as discussed above , all knots with trivial alexander polynomial are topologically slice .",
    "thus it looks fairly difficult to study knots with trivial alexander polynomial using classical invariants .",
    "nevertheless , there are very natural topological questions about such knots like the one explained in the previous section .",
    "we do not know a classical treatment of that question , so we turn to quantum invariants .",
    "one might want to use the jones polynomial , which often distinguishes knots with trivial alexander polynomial .",
    "however , it is not clear which knots it distinguishes , and which values it realizes , so the jones polynomial is of no help to this problem .",
    "thus , we are looking for a quantum invariant that relates well to classical topology , has good realization properties , and is one step beyond the alexander polynomial .    in a development starting with the melvin - morton - rozansky conjecture and going all the way to the recent work of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the kontsevich integral has been reorganized in a rational form @xmath7 which is closer to the algebraic topology of knots .",
    "it is now a theorem ( a restatement of the mmr conjecture ) that the `` 1-loop '' part of the kontsevich integral gives the same information as the alexander polynomial @xcite .",
    "the quantum invariant in theorem  [ thm.main ] is the `` 2-loop '' part @xmath8 of the _ rational invariant _",
    "@xmath7 of @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath8 as an invariant of alexander polynomial  1 knots @xmath9 in integral homology spheres @xmath10 , and summarize its properties :    * @xmath8 takes values in the abelian group @xmath11 } { ( t_1t_2t_3 - 1,\\quad\\sym_3\\times\\sym_2 ) } \\ ] ] the second relations are given by the symmetric groups @xmath12 which acts by permuting the @xmath13 , and @xmath14 which inverts the @xmath13 simultaneously .",
    "* under connected sums and orientation - reversing , @xmath8 behaves as follows : @xmath15 * if one applies the augmentation map @xmath16 then @xmath17 is mapped to the casson invariant @xmath18 , normalized by @xmath19 .",
    "* @xmath8 has a simple behavior under surgery on _ null claspers _ , see section  [ sec.q ] .",
    "all these properties are proven in @xcite and in @xcite .    given a homology sphere @xmath10 ,",
    "the image of @xmath8 on knots in @xmath20 with trivial alexander polynomial is the subspace @xmath21 of @xmath22 .",
    "the realization in the above proposition is concrete , not abstract .",
    "in fact , to realize the subgroup @xmath21 one only needs ( connected sums of ) knots which are obtained as follows : pick a standard seifert surface @xmath23 of genus one for the unknot in @xmath20 , and do a surgery along a clasper @xmath24 with one loop and two leaves which are meridians to the bands of @xmath23 , just like in figure  [ fig.example ] . the loop of @xmath24 may intersect @xmath23 and these intersection create the interesting examples . note that all of these knots are ribbon which implies unfortunately that the invariant @xmath8 does _ not _ factor through knot concordance , even though it vanishes on knots of the form @xmath25 .",
    "together with the following finiteness result , the above realization result proves theorem  [ thm.main ] , even for knots in a fixed homology sphere .",
    "the value of @xmath8 on knots with minimal seifert rank is the subgroup of @xmath22 , ( finitely ) generated by the three elements @xmath26 this holds for knots in 3-space , and one only has to add @xmath18 to all three elements to obtain the values of @xmath8 for knots in a homology sphere @xmath20 .",
    "if a knot @xmath9 in @xmath27 has minimal seifert rank , then @xmath28 can be computed in terms of three vassiliev invariants of degree  @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath8 invariant can be in fact calculated on many classes of examples .",
    "one such computation was done in @xcite : the ( untwisted ) whitehead double of a knot @xmath9 has minimal seifert rank and @xmath30 is a nontrivial vassiliev invariant of degree  @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath9 has minimal seifert rank if and only if it bounds a certain grope of class  3 .",
    "more precisely , the bottom surface of this grope is just the seifert surface , and the second stages are embedded disjointly from the seifert surface .",
    "however , they are allowed to intersect each other .",
    "so this condition is quite different to the notion of a `` grope cobordism '' introduced in @xcite .    in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will study related questions for boundary links .",
    "this is made possible by the rational version of the kontsevich integral for such links recently defined in @xcite .",
    "the analogue of knots with trivial alexander polynomial are called _ good boundary links_. in @xcite this term was used for boundary links whose free cover has trivial homology .",
    "unfortunately , the term was also used in @xcite for a class of boundary links which should be rather called _",
    "boundary links of minimal seifert rank_. this class of links is relevant because they form the atomic surgery problems for topological @xmath2-manifolds , see remark  [ rem.atomic ] . by theorem  [ thm.main ]",
    "the two definitions of good boundary links in the literature actually differ substantially ( even for knots ) .",
    "one way to resolve the `` schlamassel '' would be to drop this term all together .",
    "we briefly recall some basic notions for knots in homology spheres .",
    "we decided to include the proofs because they are short and might not be well known for homology spheres , but we claim no originality .",
    "let @xmath9 be a knot in a homology sphere @xmath10 . by looking at the inverse image of a regular value under a map @xmath32",

    "@xmath23 for @xmath9 .",
    "it is a connected oriented surface embedded in @xmath20 with boundary @xmath9 .",
    "note that a priori the resulting surface is not connected , but one just ignores the closed components . by the usual discussion about twistings near @xmath9",
    ", one sees that a collar of @xmath23 always defines the linking number zero pushoff of @xmath9 .    to discuss uniqueness of seifert surfaces ,",
    "assume that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are both connected oriented surfaces in @xmath20 with boundary @xmath9 .",
    "after a finite sequence of `` additions of tubes '' , i.e.  ambient 0-surgeries , @xmath34 and @xmath35 become isotopic .",
    "consider the following closed surface in the product @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 $ ] ) : @xmath38 as above , relative alexander duality shows that this surface bounds an connected oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath39 , embedded in @xmath36 . by general position",
    ", we may assume that the projection @xmath40 restricts to a morse function on @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , the usual dimension counts show that after an ambient isotopy of @xmath41 in @xmath42 one can arrange for @xmath43 to be an ordered morse function , in the sense that the indices of the critical points appear in the same order as their values under @xmath44 .",
    "this can be done relative to @xmath45 since @xmath44 has no critical points there .",
    "consider a regular value @xmath46 for @xmath44 between the index 1 and index 2 critical points .",
    "then @xmath47 is a seifert surface for @xmath9 . by morse theory ,",
    "@xmath23 is obtained from @xmath34 by    * a finite sequence of small @xmath31-spheres @xmath48 in @xmath20 being born , disjoint from @xmath34 .",
    "these correspond to the index  0 critical points of @xmath44 . * a finite sequence of tubes @xmath49 , connecting the @xmath48 to ( each other and ) @xmath34 .",
    "these correspond to the index  1 critical points of @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath41 is connected , we know that the resulting surface @xmath23 must be connected . in case there are no index  0 critical points , it is easy to see that @xmath50 is obtained from @xmath51 by additions of tubes .",
    "we will now reduce the general case to this case .",
    "this reduction is straight forward if the first tubes @xmath52 that are born have exactly one end on @xmath48 , where @xmath53 runs through all index  0 critical points .",
    "then a sequence of applications of the _ lamp cord trick _ ( in other words , a sequence of morse cancellations ) would show that up to isotopy one can ignore these pairs of critical points , which include all index  0 critical points .    to deal with the general case ,",
    "consider the level just after all @xmath48 were born and add `` artificial '' thin tubes ( in the complement of the expected @xmath49 ) to obtain a connected surface . by the lamp cord trick ,",
    "this surface is isotopic to @xmath34 , and the @xmath49 are now tubes on @xmath34 , producing a connected surface @xmath54 . since by construction the tubes @xmath49 do not go through the artificial tubes , we can cut the artificial tubes to move from @xmath54 back to @xmath23 ( through index  2 critical points ) .",
    "we can treat @xmath35 exactly as above , by turning the morse function upside down , replacing index  3 by index  0 , and index  2 by index  1 critical points .",
    "the result is a surface @xmath55 , obtained from @xmath35 by adding tubes , and such that @xmath23 is obtained from @xmath55 by cutting other tubes .    collecting the above information",
    ", we now have an ambient morse function with only critical points of index  1 and 2 , connecting @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( rel @xmath9 ) , and a middle surface @xmath50 which is tube equivalent to @xmath51 and @xmath56 .",
    "the result follows .",
    "the above proof motivates the definition of s - equivalence , which is the algebraic analogue , on the level of seifert forms , of the geometric addition of tubes .",
    "given a seifert surface @xmath23 for @xmath9 in @xmath20 , one defines the _ seifert form _",
    "@xmath57 by the formula @xmath58 .",
    "these are the usual linking numbers for circles in @xmath20 and @xmath59 is the circle @xmath60 on @xmath23 , pushed slighly off the seifert surface ( in a direction given by the orientations ) .",
    "the downarrow reminds us that in the case of @xmath61 and @xmath60 being the short and long curve on a tube , we are pushing @xmath60 _ into _ the tube , and hence the resulting linking number is one",
    ".    it should be clear what it means to `` add a tube '' to the seifert form @xmath62 : the homology increases by two free generators @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( for `` short '' and `` long '' curve on the tube ) , and the linking numbers behave as follows : @xmath65 note that there is no restriction on the linking numbers of @xmath64 with curves on @xmath23 , reflecting the fact that the tube can wind around @xmath23 in an arbitrary way .    observing that isotopy of seifert surfaces gives isomorphisms of their seifert forms , we are lead to the following algebraic notion .",
    "it abstracts the necessary equivalence relation on seifert forms coming from the non - uniqueness of the seifert surface .",
    "two seifert surfaces ( for possibly distinct knots ) are called _ s - equivalent _ if their seifert forms become isomorphic after a finite sequence of ( algebraic ) additions of tubes .",
    "it is convenient to discuss seifert forms in terms of their corresponding matrices .",
    "so for a given basis of @xmath66 , denote by @xmath67 the matrix of linking numbers describing the seifert form @xmath62 .",
    "for example , the addition of a tube has the following effect on a seifert matrix @xmath68 : @xmath69 here we have used the short and long curves on the tube as the last two basis vectors ( in that order ) .",
    "@xmath70 is the column of linking number of the long curve with the basis elements of @xmath66 and @xmath71 is its transposed row .",
    "it is clear that in general this operation can destroy the condition of having minimal seifert rank as defined in definition  [ def.minrank ] .",
    "an important invariant of s - equivalence is the _ alexander polynomial _ ,",
    "defined by @xmath72 for any seifert matrix @xmath68 for @xmath9 .",
    "one can check that this is unchanged under s - equivalence , it lies in @xmath73 $ ] and satisfies the symmetry relations @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    let @xmath23 be a seifert surface of genus @xmath76 .",
    "the following basis of @xmath66 will be useful .    * a _ geometric basis _",
    "is a set of embedded simple closed curves @xmath77 on @xmath23 with the following geometric intersections @xmath78 note that the seifert matrix @xmath67 for a geometric basis always satisfies @xmath79 * a _ trivial alexander basis _ is a geometric basis such that the corresponding seifert matrix can be written in terms of four blocks of @xmath80-matrices as follows : @xmath81 here @xmath82 is an upper triangular matrix ( with zeros on and below the diagonal ) , @xmath83 is its transpose , and @xmath84 is a symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal . *",
    "a _ minimal seifert _",
    "basis is a trivial alexander basis such that the matrices @xmath82 and @xmath84 are zero , so the seifert matrix looks as simply as could be : @xmath85    by starting with a disk , and then adding tubes according to the matrices @xmath82 and @xmath84 , it is clear that any matrix for a trivial alexander basis can occur as the seifert matrix for the unknot .",
    "the curves @xmath86 above are the short curves on the tubes , and @xmath87 are the long curves",
    ". the matrix @xmath82 must be lower triangular because the long curves can only link those short curves that are already present .",
    "the following lemma explains our choice of notation above :    any seifert surface has a geometric basis . moreover ,    * a knot has trivial alexander polynomial if and only if there is seifert surface with a trivial alexander basis . *",
    "a knot has minimal seifert rank if and only if it has a seifert surface with a minimal seifert basis .    by the classification of surfaces",
    ", they always have a geometric basis .",
    "if a knot has a trivial alexander basis , then an elementary computation using equation implies that it has trivial alexander polynomial .",
    "finally , the seifert matrix for a minimal seifert basis obviously has minimal rank .",
    "so we are left with showing the two converses of the statements in our lemma .",
    "start with a knot with trivial alexander polynomial .",
    "then by trotter s theorem @xcite it is s - equivalent to the unknot , and hence its seifert form is obtained from the empty form by a sequence of algebraic additions of tubes .",
    "then an easy induction implies that the resulting seifert matrix @xmath67 is as claimed , so we are left with showing that the corresponding basis can be chosen to be geometric on @xmath23 .",
    "but since @xmath88 is the standard ( hyperbolic ) form , we get a symplectic isomorphism of @xmath66 which sends the given basis into a standard ( geometric ) one . since the mapping class group realizes any such symplectic isomorphism , we see that the given basis can be realized by a geometric basis",
    ".    finally , consider a seifert surface with minimal seifert rank . by assumption",
    ", there is a basis of @xmath66 so that the seifert matrix looks like @xmath89 since @xmath90 , equation implies that @xmath91 must be invertible , and hence there is a base change so that the seifert matrix has the desired form @xmath92 just as above one shows that this matrix is also realized by a geometric basis .",
    "every knot in @xmath27 with minimal seifert rank @xmath76 can be constructed from a standard genus @xmath76 seifert surface of the unknot , by tying the @xmath93 bands into a 0-framed string link with trivial linking numbers : @xmath94",
    "as we mentioned in section [ sec.question ] , we can construct examples of knots that satisfy theorem [ thm.main ] using _ surgery on claspers_. since claspers play a key role in geometric constructions , as well as in realization of quantum invariants , we include a brief discussion here . for a reference on claspers and their associated surgery ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "_ surgery _ is an operation of cutting , twisting and pasting within the category of smooth manifolds .",
    "a low dimensional example of surgery is the well - known _ dehn surgery _",
    ", where we start from a framed link @xmath5 in a 3-manifold @xmath20 , we cut out a tubular neighborhood of @xmath5 , twist the boundary using the framing , and glue back .",
    "the result is a 3-dimensional manifold @xmath95 .",
    "clasper surgery is entirely analogous to dehn surgery , excpet that it is operated on claspers rather than links",
    ". a a clasper is a thickening of a trivalent graph , and it has a preferred set of loops , called the leaves .",
    "the degree of a clasper is the number of trivalent vertices ( excluding those at the leaves ) . with our conventions ,",
    "the smallest clasper is a y - clasper ( which has degree one and three leaves ) , so we explicitly exclude struts ( which would be of degree zero with two leaves ) .    a clasper of degree  1 is an embedding @xmath96 of a regular neighborhood @xmath97 of the graph @xmath98 ( with 4 trivalent vertices and 6 edges )    @xmath99 into a 3-manifold @xmath20 .",
    "surgery on @xmath24 can be described by removing the genus  3 handlebody @xmath100 from @xmath20 , and regluing by a certain diffeomorphism of its boundary ( which acts trivially on the homology of the boundary ) .",
    "we will denote the result of surgery by @xmath101 . to explain the regluing diffeomorphism",
    ", we describe surgery on @xmath24 by surgery on the following framed six component link @xmath5 in @xmath20 : @xmath5 consists of a @xmath102-framed borromean ring and an arbitrarily framed three component link , the so - called _ leaves _ of @xmath24 , see the figure above .",
    "the framings of the leaves reflect the prescribed neighborhood @xmath100 of @xmath98 in @xmath20 .",
    "if one of the leaves is @xmath102-framed and bounds an embedded disk disjoint from the rest of @xmath24 , then surgery on @xmath24 does not change the 3-manifold @xmath20 , because the gluing diffeomorphism extends to @xmath100 . in terms of the surgery on @xmath5",
    "this is explained by a sequence of kirby moves from @xmath5 to the empty link ( giving a diffeomorphism @xmath103 ) .",
    "however , if a second link @xmath104 in @xmath105 intersects the disk bounding the 0-framed leaf of @xmath5 then the pairs @xmath106 and @xmath107 might not be diffeomorphic .",
    "this is the way how claspers act on knots or links in a fixed @xmath0-manifold @xmath20 , a point of view which is most relevant to this paper .",
    "a particular case of surgery on a clasper of degree  1 ( sometimes called a y - move ) looks locally as follows :    @xmath108 in general , surgery on a clasper @xmath24 of degree @xmath109 is defined in terms of simoultaneous surgery on @xmath109 claspers @xmath110 of degree  1 .",
    "the @xmath111 are obtained from @xmath24 by breaking its edges and inserting 0-framed hopf linked leaves as follows :    @xmath112 in particular , consider the clasper @xmath24 of degree  2 in figure [ fig.example ] , which has two leaves and two edges .",
    "we can insert two pairs of hopf links in the edges of @xmath24 to form two claspers @xmath113 and @xmath114 of degree  1 , and describe the resulting clasper surgery on @xmath113 and @xmath114 by using twice the above figure on each of the leaves of @xmath24 .",
