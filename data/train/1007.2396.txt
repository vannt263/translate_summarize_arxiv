    "recent experiments , including the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite @xcite , quad @xcite , bicep @xcite and others @xcite , have led to a precise determination of the basic parameters of the standard @xmath6cdm cosmological model , including the parameters describing the primordial density perturbations .    according to this concordance model ,",
    "the universe underwent a period of near - exponential expansion , termed inflation , at very early times .",
    "the standard model of inflation is based on the single field slow - roll scenario . in this scenario ,",
    "the expansion is driven by a scalar field ( the inflaton ) gradually rolling down a flat potential during the inflationary stage .",
    "inflation ended when the slow - roll conditions were broken , and the inflaton decayed into relativistic particles which re - heated the universe .    in spite of many phenomenological successes of inflation based on effective field theory ,",
    "serious problems remain concerning the origin of the scalar field driving inflation , namely the singularity problem @xcite and the trans - plankian problem @xcite .",
    "consequently , efforts have been made to realize inflation in a more natural way from some fundamental theory of microscopic physics .",
    "brane inflation @xcite from high dimensional string theory is a typical example . in this scenario ,",
    "the universe is embedded into a high dimensional warped space - time .",
    "the anti - brane is fixed at the bottom of a warped throat , while the brane is mobile and experiences a small attractive force towards the anti - brane .",
    "inflation ends when the brane and the anti - brane collide and annihilate , initiating the hot big bang epoch . during the brane collision , cosmic strings",
    "would be copiously produced , and would leave an imprint on the cmb sky @xcite . searching for this cosmic string signal in",
    "the cmb is an important way to test the correctness of this scenario .",
    "another approach for realizing a period of inflation , based on loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) has been proposed recently ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "lqg is a non - perturbative and background - independent quantization of general relativity .",
    "based on a canonical approach , it uses ashtekar variables , namely su(2 ) valued connections and conjugate densitized triads .",
    "the quantization is obtained through holonomies of the connections and fluxes of the densitized triads .",
    "more importantly , when the energy density of the universe was approaching the critical density @xmath7 , the universe entered into a bouncing period due to repulsive quantum geometrical effects .",
    "thus , the big bang is replaced by a `` big bounce '' .",
    "this , to some extent , avoids the singularity problem in the standard @xmath6cdm model .",
    "differentiating between these three classes of models ( standard field inflation , brane inflation and loop quantum cosmology ) , which are motivated by different microscopic physics , is a crucially important goal for modern cosmology . since the primordial scalar ,",
    "vector and tensor perturbations produced in these models are quite different from each other , they will in general leave different signatures in the cmb radiation .",
    "numerous authors have constrained the parameters of standard field inflation models from cmb and large scale structure observations .",
    "( see for example @xcite for some recent analyses . )",
    "most of these analyses have made use of both temperature and polarization cmb measurements and their constraints have been dominated by the temperature measurements .",
    "however , with the advent of a new generation of cmb polarization measurements @xcite , it is now possible to obtain meaningful constraints solely from measurements of the @xmath0-mode polarization of the cmb . since @xmath0-mode polarization on very large scale",
    "is generated only by tensor perturbations in the early universe , this is a particularly attractive technique : a detection of @xmath0-mode polarization at large enough angular scales _ must _ be due to gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations ) and the connection with early universe physics is then very clear .",
    "in addition , small scale @xmath0-mode polarization is possibly sourced by cosmic string .",
    "this potential of @xmath0-mode measurements to constrain inflation parameters was demonstrated recently to great effect by the bicep collaboration who used their @xmath0-mode constraints on large angular scales to obtain a 95% upper limit on the tensor - to - scalar ratio of @xmath8 .",
    "note that on small scales , @xmath0-modes are also generated by gravitational lensing of the dominant @xmath9-mode polarization signal and so in general , large - angular scale measurements are required in order to avoid confusion from the signal due to lensing .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the investigation of inflationary constraints from cmb @xmath0-mode polarization measurements alone by considering the constraints obtainable on the three classes of models described above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ bmode ] ,",
    "we briefly review the characterization of cmb polarization in terms of @xmath9- and @xmath0-modes . in section  [ observations ] , we present the currently available @xmath0-mode constraints , and the predicted noise levels for some current and future cmb experiments . in section",
    "[ data - analysis ] , we first present the likelihood and hyper - parameter analysis methods , which we will use in the parameter estimation . we then describe the fisher information matrix formalism which we will use to forecast the constraints obtainable using future experiments . in section  [ sfi - power - spectrum ] , we discuss the tensor perturbations which arise in the single field inflationary ( hereafter sfi ) model , and in section  [ constraints - sfi ] , we constrain the parameters of the sfi model using the bicep and quad data . in section  [ fisher - sfi ] , we calculate the single - to - noise ratio for a number of future cmb experiments and their combinations , and present forecasts for the constraints obtainable on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath10 with future observations . in section  [ sfi - model - discussion ] , we discuss four types of single field slow - roll inflation models , and their detectability with future experiments .",

    "in this appendix , we first review the basic results of conventional @xmath67 statistics and then generalize the analysis to the hyper - parameter technique .      a conventional joint @xmath184 analysis will minimize the following combined @xmath184 @xmath185where each @xmath186 follows the chi - square distribution @xmath187it is easy to show that this chi - square distribution is properly normalized , i.e. @xmath188and the expectation value and the variance are @xmath189therefore , the minimum @xmath184 value of a properly constrained model should satisfy the following relation @xmath190for the @xmath67 with order @xmath80 , this is @xmath191if the @xmath192 @xmath193 , we can say that the model does not provide a good fit to the data , whereas if @xmath192 @xmath194 , we say that the model overfits the data , which may mean that the model has redundant free parameters .",

    "the hyper - parameter approach to combining the constraints from different data sets can be useful in the case where the different data sets have different levels of systematics . to weight each data set , one should multiply each @xmath67 by a free parameter , @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the weight parameter for each data set .",
    "one can marginalize these weight parameters in a bayesian analysis , and in @xcite , the authors found that instead of minimizing the combined @xmath202 one should instead minimize the following quantity @xmath203where @xmath204 is the number of degrees of freedom for each data set .",
