    "today , unprecedented efforts are devoted to the study of novel topological insulating phases , which exhibit remarkable properties at their boundaries.@xcite in two dimensions , these quantum states are characterized by propagating edge states , which carry dissipationless currents along one - dimensional boundaries . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", these transport properties rely on the existence of large bulk gaps in the energy spectrum , which host robust and gapless edge excitations . different edge state structures and transport properties",
    "can be realized according to the nature of the gaps : a magnetic field breaks time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) and leads to chiral edge states ( i.e. , particles propagating in a given direction ) and quantized hall currents,@xcite whereas a large spin - orbit coupling preserves the trs and produces helical edge structures.@xcite in the latter situation , referred to as the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect , edge states with opposite spins counterpropagate and contribute to a vanishing hall current , while producing a spin hall current.@xcite the origins of the quantum hall ( qh ) and qsh phases are fundamentally different , as the former is produced by an external field , whereas the latter relies on the intrinsic properties of the material .",
    "however , one can interpret the qsh phase as being two opposite qh phases , one for each spin component .",
    "this observation is easily shown through the kane - mele lattice model,@xcite which realizes the qsh effect by the inclusion of the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( iso ) , and corresponds to two copies of the ( qh ) haldane model.@xcite    in recent works , the iso coupling has been combined with a magnetic field,@xcite or with a constant exchange term,@xcite in order to study the effect of the trs breaking on the qsh effect .",
    "it has been shown that the qsh effect persists in the presence of magnetic field , leading to the `` trs - broken''@xcite or `` weak '' qsh",
    "effect.@xcite the term `` weak '' refers to the absence of robustness against spin - flip scattering due to magnetic disorder . in absence of this scattering process ,",
    "the hall and spin hall conductivities are protected and quantized .    in this work ,",
    "we present a different approach to study the interplay between qh and qsh physics .",
    "contrarily to the general trend in the field of topological insulators , which is to include many terms and study complicated hamiltonians , here we investigate the minimal models that can produce topological phases .",
    "we consider a tight - binding model of the honeycomb lattice under a perpendicular magnetic field , which includes the iso coupling , the rashba spin - orbit ( rso ) coupling , and the zeeman effect .",
    "this spin-1/2 model was introduced in our recent paper,@xcite where we already studied the combined effects of some of these terms . here , instead",
    ", we first investigate the effect of each of these terms individually on the qh phases generated by the magnetic field , in order to distill the problem .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate the equivalence of the iso and zeeman terms in generating the weak qsh phase at zero energy in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "then , we show that the iso coupling can drive topological phase transitions between different topological insulating phases , an effect which totally relies on the combination of the iso coupling and the magnetic field .",
    "secondly , we study the interplay between the terms incorporated in our model .",
    "for example , we discuss the competition between the iso coupling and zeeman effect , motivated by the similarity of these terms for generating the weak qsh effect .",
    "we show that the combination of these terms does not necessarily lead to a larger regime of parameters where the weak qsh effect is observed , which reveals the subtle competition between each of these terms and the magnetic field .",
    "we also study the exquisite effects produced by the rashba coupling in the presence of a large exchange field , which is shown to generate several qh gaps , even in the absence of a magnetic field . from another perspective",
    ", we also discuss the fate of the weak qsh phase , as the rso coupling is turned on , which introduces spin - flip terms into the hamiltonian , so that the spins are no longer aligned perpendicularly to the plane , and the spin hall conductivity is no longer protected .",
    "an important motivation for the investigation of these topological phases and phase transitions is the rich variety of systems where they may be observed . despite its weak iso coupling",
    ", graphene remains an appealing candidate for the observation of these phases , e.g. , by increasing the iso coupling artificially by adatoms.@xcite secondly , several experimental groups have reported on synthetic honeycomb lattices in a condensed matter system , for instance arrays of quantum dots on a gaas substrate,@xcite and `` molecular graphene '' , where the lattice is created by using the repulsive interactions of co molecules deposited in a triangular array on a cu(111 ) surface.@xcite these systems have larger lattice constants , which lead to a higher flux per plaquette at realistic magnetic field values , and allow for a more flexible control over the parameters than in real graphene .",
    "a third type of experiments that motivates our studies is the recent realization of a honeycomb optical lattice for ultracold atoms.@xcite in cold - atom systems , large magnetic fields@xcite and spin - orbit couplings@xcite are produced synthetically by adjustable lasers ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "in particular , such artificial gauge potentials could be produced in optical lattices,@xcite thus leading to the possibility to probe the high - flux regime .",
    "furthermore , we note that optical _",
    "lattices subjected to well - designed gauge potentials can reproduce the properties of honeycomb lattice systems , exhibiting dirac - type physics.@xcite cold - atoms systems carry the advantages of high tunability , necessary for studying phase transitions , and allow for the study of topological phases in absence of interparticle interactions @xcite and disorder.@xcite these possible experimental realizations are explored in detail in the final part of this work .",

    "we consider a tight - binding model of spinful electrons in a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice , subjected to a uniform perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "this model was introduced in ref .   to investigate the effects of an external magnetic field on the kane - mele model ( cf .",

    ", we include four effects into the hamiltonian , written as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the annihilation operator for electrons at site @xmath4 .",
    "the first term @xmath13 describes hopping between two nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites @xmath5 and @xmath4 , where @xmath14 denotes the hopping amplitude .",
    "the second term @xmath15 describes the zeeman effect , which is an on - site term that assigns different potentials to the two spin components via the pauli matrix @xmath16 .",
    "its amplitude is proportional to the magnetic flux @xmath8 and the coefficient @xmath17 , which is related to the material s land @xmath18 factor by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the bohr magneton .",
    "note that in a cold - atom emulation of this model , the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath17 are tuned individually ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ sect_experiment_optical_lattices ] ) .",
    "the zeeman term lifts the degeneracy by shifting the two spin - degenerate copies of the spectrum up and down by an equal amount of energy .",
    "the third term @xmath21 describes the iso coupling , which corresponds to a next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping with amplitude @xmath22.@xcite here , the factor @xmath23 , where the sign depends on the value of @xmath24 , i.e. , the outer product of the two bond vectors connecting site @xmath4 to site @xmath5 via their unique common neighbor at site @xmath25 .",
    "this hopping also involves the matrix @xmath16 , so that the sign of the hopping amplitude is opposite for the two spin components @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the two different spin species are effectively subjected to opposite local ( haldane - type @xcite ) magnetic flux . in absence of a magnetic field , this term opens a topologically nontrivial gap , and causes the qsh effect , characterized by so - called helical edge states , which are protected by trs.@xcite the final term @xmath28 is the contribution to the nn hopping due to the rso coupling .",
    "this hopping has an amplitude @xmath29 , and involves the spin matrix @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the vector connecting sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting spin matrix has only off - diagonal elements , so that this hopping involves a spin flip .",
    "this term couples the two spin components , and as a consequence , @xmath16 is no longer a good quantum number for @xmath33 . in practice",
    ", this means that spin states are no longer exclusively up or down , but may also point in different directions .",
    "finally , we remark that the model considered here preserves inversion symmetry .",

    "in the following sections , we will perform an analysis of the various topological phases produced by the terms in the model hamiltonian  . before going into details , describing each term individually and their combined effects ,",

    "readers who are already familiar with the notions of bulk and edge states , chern numbers , and ( spin ) hall conductivity may choose to skip this section .      we will illustrate our framework by studying the spin - degenerate model , i.e. , we set @xmath34 in hamiltonian .",
    "we assume @xmath35 throughout the whole text .",
    "the bulk band structure can be computed numerically by applying periodic boundary conditions , namely by considering a toroidal geometry .",
    "this requires to set @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are integers , in which case the system is periodic in both spatial directions . under these conditions , and by choosing a proper gauge for the peierls phases @xmath6 , the system reduces to a @xmath39 magnetic unit cell .",
    "( see the appendix for a description of the gauge structure and its spatial periodicity . ) by applying a fourier transform and invoking bloch s theorem , the schrdinger equation reduces to a @xmath40 eigenvalue problem , known as the discrete harper equation , @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the single - particle wave function at site @xmath43 , and where the @xmath44 matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given in terms of the parameters defined in hamiltonian ( see the appendix for details ) .",

    "[ fig_spectrum_spinless ] may be characterized by a topological invariant , which encodes the hall conductivity of this system when the fermi energy lies inside this gap .",
    "the integer values of the hall conductivity are robust against external perturbations : they remain constant as long as the bulk gaps remain open . in the following , we recall the relation between this transport coefficient and the concept of edge states and topological invariants .",
    "the edge - state analysis can be performed for a system featuring a boundary,@xcite such as a cylinder , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_cylinder_edge_states](a ) .",
    "when solving the harper equation on a cylinder , namely by applying periodic boundary conditions along one spatial direction only , the spectrum consists of _ bulk bands _ and _ topological edge states_.@xcite indeed , we typically find a few _ edge states _ within the bulk gaps , some of which _ cross _ the gap from one bulk band to the other ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_cylinder_edge_states](b ) .",
    "importantly , each edge state contributes @xmath53 ( one quantum of conductivity ) to the hall conductivity of the system .",
    "the total hall conductivity is therefore equal to an integer number ( i.e. , the number of edge - state branches ) times @xmath53 .",
    "the topological invariance of the hall conductivity is due to the fact that the number of edge states inside the bulk gap can not be altered unless the gap is closed .",
    "this result can be used to derive the topological invariant associated to any of the bulk gaps , leading to the colors in the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum_spinless ] . for this spin - degenerate model ,",
    "all topological invariants are multiples of @xmath61 because the system is twofold spin degenerate .",
    "more precisely , in order to evaluate the hall conductivity of a bulk gap , we count the edge states whose dispersions intersect the fermi energy , taking into account their location and direction of propagation .",
    "the location of each state is derived by computing its expectation value @xmath60 from the eigenstate , which provides the coloring of fig .",
    "[ fig_cylinder_edge_states](b ) .",
    "secondly , the direction of propagation can be obtained from the sign of its momentum derivative @xmath62 , where @xmath4 is the momentum parallel to the edge .",
    "edge states with opposite directions contribute with opposite signs to the hall current and therefore to the hall conductivity , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the number of left- and right - moving states , respectively .",
    "the hall conductivity does not depend on the magnitude of the velocity ( @xmath66 ) , but instead is given by the number of edge - state channels.@xcite in this spin - degenerate model , the states are all either left- or right - moving , i.e. , they are _ chiral _ states .",
    "the chirality of the edge modes provides protection of the hall conductivity against backscattering due to disorder in the presence of broken trs .      remarkably , the number of edge states is directly related to topological invariants , the _ chern numbers _ , a quantity associated with each of the bulk bands .",
    "the chern number is an integer topological index defined in the toroidal geometry,@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the berry connection associated to the eigenstate @xmath69 , and where bz denotes the ( toroidal ) brillouin zone .",
    "the number of edge states @xmath70 inside the @xmath71th bulk gap , or equivalently the hall conductivity assigned to this gap ( cf .",
    "discussion above ) , is then equal to the sum of all the chern numbers associated to the occupied bands,@xcite @xmath72 this identity is known as the _ bulk - boundary correspondence_,@xcite as it relates the topological indices associated to the bulk bands to the number of edge excitations .",
    "this correspondence provides us with an important observation : although the dispersions of the edge states depend on the shape of the edges ( e.g. , zigzag , bearded , or armchair ) and on the system size , the number of edge - state branches does not : this number is a bulk property and therefore does not depend on the specific form of the edge . in the remainder of this paper , we will study systems with zigzag and bearded edges , without any loss of generality concerning the topological properties .    in the next sections , we will characterize the topological phases by their associated hall conductivity and edge - state structures .",
    "as described in the following , the edge states produced by the magnetic field are affected in the presence of strong perturbing terms , such as the spin orbit couplings and zeeman splitting . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will show these effects using the edge - state analysis obtained from a cylindrical geometry , rather than focusing on the analysis of the bulk topological invariants .",
    "an efficient method to compute the hall conductivity can be formulated in terms of the integrated density of states . inside a bulk gap , the integrated density of states @xmath73",
    "is defined as the fraction of all states that lie below the gap ( which is an integer times @xmath74 ) .",
    "the hall conductivity is then proportional to the @xmath8-derivative of this quantity , @xmath75 a result known as the steda formula.@xcite we have used this powerful formula to compute the hall conductivity , and generate the colorful butterfly spectra presented in the remainder of this paper .      in the presence of terms involving the matrix @xmath16 in the hamiltonian , the spin @xmath76 symmetry is broken .",
    "if spin - flip terms ( i.e. , linear combinations of @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) are absent , the spin in the @xmath79 direction is conserved , i.e. , it is a good quantum number . in this case , which happens",
    "if the iso coupling or the zeeman splitting is present while the rso is not , the hamiltonian may be decomposed into the two spin components @xmath80 .",
    "thus , one is able to define the component - wise chern numbers @xmath81 and @xmath82 and hall conductivities @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the charge hall conductivity of the whole system is the sum of the two component - wise conductivities , @xmath85 , since both of them contribute equally to the hall current .",
    "considering their contributions to the spin current , spin - up and spin - down edge modes have opposite `` spin charges '' @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the spin hall conductivity is equal to the difference of the two component - wise conductivities , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the elementary quantum of spin hall conductivity .    in the spin - degenerate model discussed earlier ,",
    "the two component - wise hall conductivities are always equal , so that all spin hall conductivities vanish .",
    "this is certainly different if the spin degeneracy is broken .",
    "for instance , in the presence of iso , the qsh gap at zero magnetic field and at zero energy @xcite is characterized by @xmath89 . here ,",
    "the contributions to the charge hall conductivity cancel , but the contributions to the spin hall conductivity add up to @xmath90 .",
    "if the hamiltonian contains spin - flip terms , e.g. , the rashba coupling , then the spin is not conserved , and the aforementioned definition of the spin hall conductivity is no longer valid .",
    "however , the related spin chern numbers , which equal @xmath91 if spin is conserved , remain well - defined topological invariants , even in absence of spin conservation.@xcite",
    "zooming in on the butterfly of fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum_spinless ] near @xmath92 , we observe that the thickness of the bands decreases in the low - flux regime ( not shown ) .",

    "moreover , computing the hall conductivity in this region , we find the `` anomalous '' hall - conductivity sequence @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , as observed in graphene.@xcite the breakdown of this structure around @xmath93 can be understood from the large density of states near the van hove singularities and from the chern numbers associated to these many bands .",

    "since the seminal work of kane and mele,@xcite it is known that the iso coupling opens a topologically nontrivial gap of size @xmath101 at zero magnetic field .",
    "this bulk gap hosts two counterpropagating edge modes per edge , with opposite spins ( one kramers pair ) : these _ helical _ edge states are related by trs .",
    "this topological phase is known as the qsh state , and may be regarded as two opposite qh phases ( i.e. , each spin performs the qh effect , with opposite chirality ) .",
    "the system preserves trs ( due to absence of the magnetic field ) , which protects the qsh state against scattering processes caused by disorder .",
    "although for any edge state a reversely propagating mode would be available to scatter to , the spin has to be flipped , and the two different ways to flip the spin interfere destructively with each other , due to a mutual phase factor of @xmath102.@xcite    the combination of the iso coupling and a magnetic field leads to the breaking of the trs satisfied by the qsh phase .",
    "however , due to the absence of spin flip terms in the hamiltonian , the helical edge - state structure persists . in terms of charge and spin hall conductivity , the resulting state is equivalent to the qsh state .",

    "this effect is caused by the nature of the rashba coupling in the hamiltonian , which involves the outer product of the spin vector @xmath145 with the bond vectors @xmath32 , so that the spin is always perpendicular to the hopping direction .",

    "in this section , we will discuss the several experimental approaches that allow for the observation of the topological phases and phase transitions discussed in secs .",
    "[ sect_magnetic_field ] and [ sect_competition_and_phasetrans ] . for each of them , we present the opportunities and challenges , and we discuss the range of parameters that can be probed .",
    "condensed - matter systems typically have a lattice spacing in the order of @xmath244 , so that one flux quantum per unit cell ( @xmath213 ) corresponds to a magnetic field in the order of @xmath245@xmath246 .",
    "thus , only the low - flux limit is relevant with respect to realistic condensed - matter realizations of our model .",
    "the prime example of a two - dimensional system with a honeycomb lattice is graphene , which has received much attention both at the theoretical and experimental levels.@xcite in the presence of a magnetic field , graphene shows an anomalous quantum hall effect , where the landau - level energies@xcite depend on the magnetic field as @xmath247 , showing a radically different behavior than in semiconductor heterostructures ( e.g. , gaas / algaas ) .    besides",
    ", the effects of spin - orbit coupling have been extensively studied for graphene , leading to the concept of @xmath248 topological insulators.@xcite however , recent analysis has shown that graphene exhibits only a very weak iso coupling ( @xmath249@xmath250 , where @xmath251),@xcite which unfortunately prevents the observation of the qsh state in this material .",
    "nevertheless , the iso interactions may be enhanced by putting heavy adatoms on top of the graphene surface,@xcite which would open up a route to build a topological heterojunction.@xcite the zeeman effect is of appreciable order of magnitude , @xmath252 , which corresponds to gaps of @xmath253 at a magnetic field of @xmath254.@xcite values of the rashba coupling as high as @xmath255 have been reported for graphene on a ni(111 ) substrate.@xcite adsorption of metal atoms on the graphene surface increases this coupling as well.@xcite alternatively , high values of the rashba coupling ( accompanied by the spin re - orientation at the edges ) may be induced by curving graphene nanoribbons.@xcite besides , it has been suggested that large rashba coupling leads to topological phases in bilayer graphene.@xcite in addition , large effective pseudomagnetic fields , greater than @xmath256 , have been recently realized in strain - induced graphene nanobubbles.@xcite in summary , the observation of the topological phases presented here remains elusive in graphene , but should not be definitively ruled out .",
    "the qsh effect has nevertheless been observed in other two - dimensional compounds that have considerably larger values of @xmath22 , such as hg(cd)te quantum wells,@xcite where values of the order @xmath257@xmath258 have been reported.@xcite additionally , this material exhibits a strong zeeman effect as well ( @xmath259).@xcite the spin - filtered qh states have already been observed in these systems at low fields.@xcite hg(cd)te quantum wells doped with magnetic ions ( e.g. , mn ) exhibit an exchange interaction leading to the quantum anomalous hall effect at zero magnetic field,@xcite and to a nonlinear zeeman effect that causes reentrant behavior of the topological phases.@xcite      the experimental limitation of the low flux values can be overcome by studying systems with a larger lattice spacing .",
    "recently , several approaches have led to the engineering of artificial honeycomb lattices .",
    "first of all , arrays of quantum dots on a gaas , arranged in a honeycomb pattern , have been engineered to simulate actual graphene.@xcite the lattice spacing in these systems is of the order of @xmath260 , so that high flux values ( @xmath261 ) are obtained already with small magnetic fields .",
    "however , this large lattice constant leads to a small hopping amplitude , which has hampered the observation of the hofstadter butterfly until now .",
    "patterned superlattices able to probe the hofstadter regime with usual magnetic field intensities have been realized in the past , but for square geometries.@xcite to probe the physics described here , one needs a superlattice with a smaller lattice constant , grown on a substrate that could lead to the generation of a strong rashba interaction , for example . in this case ,",
    "chiral topological states could be probed also away from zero energy , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sect_halfflux ] .",
    "secondly , artificial graphene lattices have been created by manipulating co molecules with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope and arranging them in a triangular lattice on a cu(111 ) substrate.@xcite these molecules repel the electrons on the cu surface , thus creating a honeycomb array of sites between which the electrons hop .",
    "measurements of the density of states show that the electrons indeed exhibit a dirac dispersion .",
    "the typical lattice constants of these systems are approximately @xmath262 times larger than in real graphene , thus allowing for flux values @xmath263 times larger than in graphene , with reasonable magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , effective magnetic fields up to @xmath264 can be induced by triaxial strain of the artificial lattice .",
    "it can be speculated that by using a heavier metal as substrate , it may be possible to engineer such a lattice with strong spin - orbit coupling , leading to the qsh phase .",
    "although the parameters of the hamiltonian can be controlled to some extent in condensed - matter systems , the possibility to engineer the physics discussed here with ultracold atoms in optical lattices is very appealing .",
    "the advantage of the ultracold - atom realization of this model is the flexibility to control the parameters separately across a large range , compared to condensed - matter systems where these parameters are generally fixed by the material properties and the sample geometry.@xcite a second major advantage of ultracold atoms over condensed - matter systems is that the magnetic fields are produced synthetically , i.e. , the peierls phases are not due to a real magnetic field , but induced by external fields acting on atomic internal states.@xcite in this way , large effective magnetic flux can be produced ( i.e. @xmath265 ) , which allows the system to be studied beyond the low - flux limit.@xcite the spin - orbit couplings can also be synthesized in optical lattices using similar methods.@xcite moreover , in these configurations , the zeeman coupling can be controlled independently , as it is not related to the synthetic magnetic fields@xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sect_rashba_exchange ] , where we study the extreme situation where the effect of the zeeman coupling is investigated in the absence of synthetic magnetic field , in which case this term is called an `` exchange term '' ) .",
    "another important feature offered by optical - lattice setups is the possibility to control the interactions between the particles : by exploiting feshbach resonances,@xcite it is possible to reach the non - interacting regime and from there on , to include interactions in a controlled way to explore the robustness of topological order against interactions .",
    "let us mention that these systems are usually free of disorder , although disorder can also be generated and tailored at will in optical lattices.@xcite these outstanding features allowcus to study the trs - broken qsh phase , namely the survival of the qsh phase in the presence of a trs - breaking perturbation.@xcite indeed , contrarily to condensed - matter experiments , the absence of ( magnetic ) disorder can stabilize the helical ( counterpropagating ) edge states even when trs is broken .",
    "let us also comment on the fact that all the topological phases and edge - state excitations discussed here rely on the existence of robust bulk energy gaps .",
    "therefore , when the temperature of the system approaches the size of the topological gaps of interest , one expects the effects to be strongly affected , and eventually to disappear . for the ultracold temperatures achieved in cold - atom laboratories , the gaps of interest should typically be of the order @xmath266 , where @xmath14 is the tunneling amplitude .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that only the largest topological gaps presented in our figures should be considered from the cold - atom point of view .    the quantum phase transitions presented in this work could be equally characterized either by a change in the topological invariants associated to the bulk gaps of interest , or by the modification of the edge - state structures .",
    "although cold atoms do not offer the possibility to directly measure transport coefficients , several methods have been proposed to detect the topological invariants related to the quantized conductivities . @xcite these proposals are based on the fact that non - trivial band structures modify the atomic densities , leading to several signatures that can be directly seen in time - of - flight or density measurements . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to directly probe edge state structures using bragg spectroscopy techniques.@xcite in a recent work,@xcite it was shown that a state - dependent light probe , focused on the edge of the cloud and transferring angular momentum to the atoms , clearly identifies the presence of chiral edge states in a qh optical lattice .",
    "this method allows us to project the topological edge states on a dark background , making them visible in _ in situ _ density measurements . in principle",
    ", this efficient scheme could be generalized to spin-1/2 systems in order to detect and distinguish between chiral and helical edge structures .",
    "we have shown an in - depth analysis of the edge - state structures generated by the combination of the iso coupling , the rso coupling , and the zeeman effect , together with a uniform and perpendicular magnetic field . in sec .",
    "[ sect_magnetic_field ] , we have studied each term individually in order to pinpoint their effect on the quantum hall states generated by the magnetic field . in the low - field limit ,",
    "the iso coupling and zeeman effect are formally equivalent , and give rise to the weak qsh phase .",
    "away from zero energy , we observe spin - filtered , spin - imbalanced , and ordinary quantum hall phases .",
    "the rso coupling is different in the sense that it involves spin - flip terms , which causes the spin states to acquire an in - plane component .",
    "in addition , the spin direction inside the gap depends on the fermi energy , and consequently the spin hall conductivity of the system is ill - defined . in the case of high magnetic fields ,",
    "we observe dirac - type regimes away from zero energy . here , the zeeman and iso coupling open weak qsh gaps in a way analogous to the low - flux limit , whereas the rso coupling opens a trivial gap ( unlike the case at low flux , where the spectrum remains gapless ) .",
    "in addition , the topological phase transitions reported in an earlier work@xcite have been analyzed in more detail here .    a combination of the spin - orbit terms and the zeeman effect leads to subtle competitions , several examples of which have been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect_competition_and_phasetrans ] .",
    "we have shown that , although the zeeman effect and iso coupling both give rise to the qsh phase , they do not always reinforce each other , which has been illustrated by the size of the parameter regime of the weak qsh phase in the low - flux limit . at high flux ,",
    "the zeeman effect dominates over the iso coupling , but the effects of the latter are still well visible in the spectrum .",
    "interestingly , a combination of the rashba term with an exchange coupling leads to nontrivial topological phases at zero magnetic field , away from half - filling .",
    "finally , inclusion of the rashba coupling in the case where we have a weak qsh gap generated by the zeeman effect opens a gap at zero energy between the edge states , which provides an illustration of the breakdown of the qsh effect in the absence of trs and spin conservation .",
    "this work emphasizes the various topological phase transitions and edge - state structures that could be observed in a wide range of materials and quantum emulators .",
    "although we focused our analysis on the honeycomb lattice , where the spin - orbit couplings and the magnetic field configurations are expressed by specific tunneling terms and peierls phases , we note that our results do not rely on this specific geometry . the topological phases and",
    "the phase transitions discussed here are universal , in the sense that they only rely on the inclusion of general ingredients , which can be found or engineered in many different contexts and geometries . indeed",
    ", this universal property can be understood in the low - energy limit , in which various ( _ a priori _ , very different ) tight - binding models actually reduce to the same ( dirac - type ) equations . in general , we observe that the main ingredients needed to generate such physics are nontrivial gauge fields , which are coupled to the particles of interest ( e.g. , electrons in materials and atoms in optical lattices ) . in this work ,",
    "we have aimed to emphasize the effects produced by each of these ingredients independently : we have investigated the effects of spin splitting , spin mixing , and gauge potentials leading to magnetic or haldane - type local flux .",

    "<S> in this work , we explore the rich variety of two - dimensional topological phases that arise when considering the competing effects of spin - orbit couplings , zeeman splitting and uniform magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate minimal models , defined on a honeycomb lattice , which clarify the topological phases stemming from the intrinsic and rashba spin - orbit couplings , and also from the zeeman splitting . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , our work provides an interesting path connecting the quantum hall phases , generally produced by the uniform magnetic field , and the quantum spin hall phases resulting from spin - dependent couplings . </S>",
    "<S> first , we analyze the properties of each coupling term individually and we point out their similarities and differences . secondly , we investigate the subtle competitions that arise when these effects are combined . </S>",
    "<S> we finally explore the various possible experimental realizations of our model . </S>"
