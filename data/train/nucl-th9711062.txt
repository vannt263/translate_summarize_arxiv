    "preliminary data for nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions with truly heavy beams have recently become available : au+au at 11@xmath0 gev/@xmath1 at the bnl  ags and pb+pb at 160@xmath0 gev/@xmath1 at the cern  sps @xcite .",
    "a systematic analysis of these data could yield clues to whether a short - lived phase with quark and gluon constituents , the quark - gluon plasma , exists during the hot and dense stage of these reactions .    for the studies of matter properties in a+a collisions ,",
    "it is of vital importance to determine whether local thermodynamical equilibrium in the system is reached .",
    "assuming such a local thermodynamical equilibrium at the final ( freeze - out ) stage of the process , one can calculate the particle number ratios without detailed knowledge of the very complicated dynamical evolution history of the system .",
    "we remind that the _ chemical _ freezeout which determines the hadron number ratios does not necessarily coincide with the _ thermal _ freezeout which defines hadron momentum spectra .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze the preliminary data for particle number ratios of au+au ( ags ) and pb+pb ( sps ) collisions within the framework of the thermodynamical equilibrium hadron gas model .",
    "the name `` thermal model '' has often been used in the literature for this type of calculations .",
    "we stress , however , that those `` thermal models '' used in the literature to calculate particle number ratios are , in fact , very different . therefore , our first step is to explain our model and clarify its difference from other versions of `` thermal model '' .",
    "it seems natural to start with the ideal hadron gas at the freeze - out stage .",
    "all known particles and resonances should be included in this gas and the resonance decay modes to the observed particles must be taken into account as well . however , such an ideal gas model becomes inadequate in high - energy a+a collisions .",
    "the chemical freeze - out parameters , temperature @xmath2 and baryonic chemical potential @xmath3 , obtained from fitting the particle number ratios at ags and sps energies lead to artificially large values of total particle number densities which are much higher than any reasonable ( or `` intuitively expected '' ) ones at the freezeout .",
    "the total particle number density at the chemical freezeout within the ideal gas approach is @xmath4 for the ags and @xmath5 for the sps , where @xmath6 @xmath7 is the normal nuclear density .",
    "these numbers also exceed any experimental estimate obtained from the particle multiplicities and from the measurement of the volume of the system at the freezeout with pion - interferometry method . to suppress undesirable large values of particle number densities , the van der waals ( vdw ) excluded volume procedure is used .",
    "we will follow in the present paper the thermodynamically consistent excluded volume model of refs .",
    "@xcite which will be recapitulated in the next section .",
    "some other `` thermal models '' [ 48 ] also include vdw `` corrections '' , but in some _ ad hoc _ and inconsistent ways .",
    "it is often believed that the specific details of these vdw corrections are of minor importance .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "the vdw repulsion does not essentially alter the particle number ratios , but it does always give a very strong suppression effect on the values of particle number densities themselves . as we shall see below the total values of particle number densities",
    "are suppressed by a factor of 8 and 14 for ags and sps chemical freeze - out states , respectively .",
    "therefore , the influence of the vdw excluded volume procedure on particle densities , as well as on all other thermodynamical functions of the hadron gas , is very strong , and hence the correct form of the excluded volume model formulation should be employed .",
    "for non - relativistic statistical mechanics , the use of a grand canonical ensemble is usually just a matter of convenience .",
    "however , in the hadron gas considered below it is unavoidable . in a relativistic theory",
    "one can not fix the number of particles , the number of pions in a hadron gas system , for example .",
    "the average number of particles only makes sense in an equilibrium system , like in the case of a photon gas .",
    "this average number is not conserved , but increases with increasing temperature of the system .",
    "this takes place at all temperatures , even at very low ones when the thermal motion of each individual pion can be treated non - relativistically .",
    "the canonical ensemble with a fixed number of pions has no physical meaning .",
    "this statement is also valid , of course , for other hadrons .",
    "particle chemical potentials , in general , regulate not particle numbers but the values of conserved charges .",
    "strongly interacting matter has three conserved charges , viz . , baryonic number @xmath8 , strangeness @xmath9 and electric charge @xmath10 ( strangeness is conserved as we neglect `` slow '' weak interactions ) .",
    "therefore , the canonical ensemble can only be defined with fixed values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , not the fixed numbers of pions , nucleons and other hadrons .",
    "let s start with the ideal gas of one particle species with temperature @xmath2 , chemical potential @xmath11 and volume @xmath12 .",
    "the pressure @xmath13 is related to the grand canonical partition function @xmath14 and in thermodynamical limit @xmath15 , it has the following expression : @xmath16 with @xmath17^{-1}\\ ] ] being the momentum distribution function .",
    "@xmath18 is the number of particle internal degrees of freedom ( degeneracy ) and @xmath19 is the mass .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is @xmath21 for bosons , @xmath22 for fermions and @xmath23 gives the classical ( boltzmann ) approximation .",
    "the ideal gas particle number density is given by @xmath24 furthermore , the entropy density is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "the energy density can be found from another thermodynamical relation @xmath26 and is written as @xmath27    for a fixed particle number @xmath28 , the vdw excluded volume procedure means the substitution of the volume of the system @xmath12 by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the parameter corresponding to the proper volume of the particle .",
    "note that this vdw procedure , interpreted in statistical mechanics as the gas of hard - sphere particles with radius @xmath31 , requires that the volume parameter @xmath30 equal to the `` hard - core particle volume '' , @xmath32 , multiplied by a factor of 4 @xcite . to introduce the excluded volume ( _  la _ van der waals ) in our grand canonical ensemble formulation , we start with the volume substitution of @xmath12 by @xmath29 in the canonical partition function @xmath33 for each fixed @xmath28 separately .",

    "( [ partlap ] ) one sees that this exponentially increasing part of @xmath39 generates an extreme right singularity in the function @xmath43 at some point @xmath44 . for @xmath45",
    "the integration over @xmath12 for @xmath43 diverges at its upper limit .",
    "therefore , the extreme right singularity of @xmath43 at @xmath46 gives us the system pressure , @xmath47 note that this direct connection of the extreme right @xmath48-singularity of @xmath49 to the asymptotic behavior @xmath50 of @xmath51 is a general mathematical property of the laplace transform . using the above equations we find @xmath52 with eqs .",

    "( [ ssingul ] ) the transcendental equation for the pressure @xmath53 of the gas with vdw repulsion in the grand canonical ensemble : @xmath54    at this point some comments are appropriate .",
    "first , we remind that the singularity @xmath55 of the @xmath43 function has nothing to do with phase transition singularities of the system . a singularity at @xmath56 exists for the ideal gas as well  one can easily recover the ideal gas formulae by putting @xmath57 in the above equations .",

    "( [ vdw ] ) the ideal gas pressure , @xmath59 , increases due to the excluded volume repulsion as expected intuitively while eqs .",

    "in tables i and ii , we show the values of the total meson number density @xmath175 , baryon number density @xmath176 , total particle number density @xmath177 ( antibaryons included ) , total energy density @xmath178 and total pion number density @xmath179 , which includes both thermal pions and contributions from resonance decays , at chemical freezeout . the ideal hadron gas ( @xmath180 ) results are given in the first row , and those from our calculations with different @xmath163 values along the curves in fig .  4 are shown in the remaining 4 rows .",
    "we emphasize that the last rows in the tables give our results for the intersection point ( @xmath173 fm , @xmath181 fm ) , and that these values are our predictions within the vdw hadron gas model for the chemical freezeout at au+au ags and pb+pb sps collisions , respectively .",
    "we believe that these @xmath182 values , along with the corresponding densities , give a reasonable physical solution for the chemical freeze - out state in a+a collisions considered .",
    "a self - consistent hadron gas model with the vdw excluded volume is considered and critically compared with other `` thermal models '' used in the literature .",
    "this approach is then adopted to analyze the preliminary data of au+au ( ags ) and pb+pb ( sps ) . within the vdw model ,",
    "the obtained values of particle number and energy densities , and other thermodynamical functions at chemical freezeout are very different from those obtained in the ideal hadron gas , as seen in the first and last rows in tables i and ii . because of their strong effects on hadron thermodynamical functions , the vdw gas formulation should be properly treated .",
    "the preliminary data of au+au ( ags ) and pb+pb ( sps ) for the particle number ratios can be fitted in the vdw hadron gas as shown in figs .",
    "the model parameters , given in eqs .",
    "( [ ags],[sps ] ) , lead to the enhancement of pions in pion to hadron ratios as compared to the ideal hadron gas model predictions .",
    "this enhancement in pions is regulated by @xmath156 ( @xmath183 ) and is explained in the vdw model by a smaller pion `` hard - core radius '' than those of all other hadrons .",
    "the obtained parameters for au+au ( ags ) and pb+pb ( sps ) define two curves in the @xmath163-plane , respectively .",
    "these two curves shown in fig .  4 intersect at the point ( @xmath173 fm , @xmath174 fm ) .",
    "it is the solution in the vdw hadron gas model to fit simultaneously the ags and sps data for all particle number ratios .",
    "the absolute values of the particle number and energy densities in the vdw hadron gas for this solution are listed in the last rows of tables i and ii . we stress that these values are much smaller than those in the ideal hadron gas at the same @xmath2 and @xmath3 shown in the first rows of tables i and ii . there is an experimental estimate for the freeze - out pion number density in si+pb central collisions at the ags energy : @xmath184 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "our result @xmath185 @xmath7 for au+au ags collisions shown in the last row of the table i is quite close to this experimental estimate .",
    "the next step is naturally to fit hadron momentum spectra .",
    "it requires the inclusion of the longitudinal and transverse collective flow effects .",
    "the temperature @xmath127 mev looks a little too high for use in the fitting of the transverse momentum spectra in pb+pb ( sps ) collisions .",
    "for example , the pion inverse slope parameter is near @xmath186 mev @xcite and the freeze - out temperature @xmath127 mev seems to leave almost no room for the transverse collective motion effects .",
    "however , two facts should be taken into account .",
    "first , the temperature determined from particle number ratios is for the chemical freezeout which could be higher than the thermal freeze - out temperature used in particle spectra calculations .",
    "second , we remind again that there are large resonance decay contributions to pion production . even after the enhancement of thermal pions with @xmath187 mev",
    ", resonance decays contribute more than 60@xmath139 to the final pions .",
    "these resonance decays are known to lead to a lower pion ` effective temperature ' ( the inverse slope parameter ) at the transverse pion mass less than 1 gev .",
