    "<S> based on the microscopic transport model urqmd in which hadronic and string degrees of freedom are employed , the hbt parameters in the longitudinal co - moving system are investigated for charged pion and kaon , and @xmath0 sources in heavy ion collisions ( hics ) at sps and rhic energies . in the cascade mode , @xmath1 and the @xmath2 at high sps and rhic energies do not follow the @xmath3-scaling , however , after considering a soft equation of state with momentum dependence ( sm - eos ) for formed baryons and a density - dependent skyrme - like potential for `` pre - formed '' particles , the hbt radii of pions and kaons and even those of @xmath0s with large transverse momenta follow the @xmath3-scaling function @xmath4 fairly well .    in order to explore the properties of the fireball which is created just after the collision of two energetic nuclei , the hanbury - brown - twiss interferometry ( hbt ) technique has been used and developed in astro- and nuclear - particle physics for about half a century . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that the hbt technique can provide important information about the spatio - temporal structure of the particle emission source ( the region of homogeneity ) . in @xcite , a non - trivial transition in the excitation function of spatio - temporal characteristics of the source </S>",
    "<S> was proposed . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the ags , sps and rhic experiments ( with nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energies @xmath5 from about 2.5 gev up to 200 gev for heavy ion collisions ) have been stimulating the hbt related investigations further into another golden era . although the experiments have discovered quite a few exciting hints for a new phase of matter - maybe a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) ( see , e.g. , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , a plethora of puzzling phenomena also came out . </S>",
    "<S> examples related to hbt are ,    1 .   the discovered that there is no _ obvious _ peak / valley of the hbt quantities over the whole beam energies from sis , ags , sps , up to rhic as suggested in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> that hydro - dynamic as well as transport ( cascade mode ) calculations show that the calculated ratio of the hbt radii in outward and sideward directions is higher than the experimental data , which is known as the hbt time - puzzle ( `` t - puzzle `` ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for possible solutions of the ' ' t - puzzle '' we refer to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   mainly due to the resonance decay contribution of the particle production as well as the effects of strong and electromagnetic forces </S>",
    "<S> , the correlation function of identical particles deviates from a gaussian type @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a `` direct '' study of the so - called `` non - gaussian effect ''  the emission source image technique has been quickly improving in recent years @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to theoretically investigate previous data and due to the fact that it gives a leading - order approximation to the real shape of the homogeneity region , the gaussian parameterization is still important . during the process of gaussian parameterization </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that on both experimental and theoretical sides , a proper potential modification of the final state interaction ( fsi ) after freeze - out should be analyzed before any work is done because of the intrinsic physical characteristic of correlated pairs . </S>",
    "<S> for example , charged pion - pion interferometry is only relatively weakly affected by the coulomb and nuclear potentials due to its small mass and collision cross section , while for charged kaon - kaon case , the coulomb modification should be taken into account in analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for baryon - baryon correlation , a proper nuclear potential modification has to be considered . in the absence of fsi and from a hydro - dynamic point of view </S>",
    "<S> in which the freeze - out of particles is flow - dominated , the hbt radii are predicted to decrease with @xmath6 ( @xmath3-scaling ) , @xmath3 is the transverse mass of the observed particle - pair , independent of the particle species @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction has been probed by recent experiments with energies from ags to rhic . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a @xmath3-scaling expression @xmath7 has been suggested at @xmath8 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it is also supported by other experiments at rhic energies ( see references in , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the lack of data and the rather large experimental errors , a firm conclusion is still awaiting . </S>",
    "<S> it is also urgent to perform microscopic transport - model calculations to explore possible deviation from the ideal @xmath3-scaling especially in order to understand ` non - gaussian' effects as well as the hbt puzzles .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the @xmath3 dependence of the hbt parameters with three kinds of identical - particle correlations : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> so far the most majority of hbt investigations are on the @xmath12 pairs due to their large yield . in order to obtain a cleaner signal with sensitivity to earlier stages of hics , </S>",
    "<S> kaon - kaon correlations have been explored at several energies @xcite . besides mesons , in order to map out a widespread @xmath3-dependence , the @xmath11 baryonic correlation is the next convenient choice . </S>",
    "<S> it is an identical non - charged - particle correlation so that a similarly gaussian shape as for pions can be expected if the nuclear potential is not considered in fsi .    to explore the @xmath3-scaling </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the urqmd model . in urqmd </S>",
    "<S> , the hadrons are represented by gaussian wave packets in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> after the wood - saxon initialization , the phase space of hadrons is propagated according to hamilton s equation of motion @xcite , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the coordinate and the momentum of hadron @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath18 consists of the kinetic energy @xmath19 and the effective interaction potential energy @xmath20 , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the two - body coulomb potential is considered for formed charged particles . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a soft equation of state with momentum dependence ( sm - eos ) for formed hadrons and a density dependent skyrme - like term for `` pre - formed '' hadrons from string fragmentation have been supplied into the urqmd transport model , please see details in @xcite . for observables such as the nuclear stopping , the elliptic flow and the hbt parameters of pions visible improvement towards the data has been observed if these potentials are included . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the hbt `` t - puzzle '' for pions can be consistently solved . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we continue this topic and further calculate the hbt parameters of kaon and @xmath0 sources .    </S>",
    "<S> three cases of experimental data at mid - rapidity are compared with our calculations and the phase space cuts are same as those listed in @xcite , the three systems under investigation are : ( 1 ) central pb+pb collisions at the sps beam energy @xmath22 gev ( dubbed  e20  ) , ( 2 ) central pb+pb collisions at the sps beam energy @xmath23 gev (  e158  ) , ( 3 ) central au+au collisions at the top rhic energy @xmath24 gev (  s200  ) . </S>",
    "<S> for each case about @xmath25 thousand central events are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> if not stated otherwise , the urqmd transport program stops at @xmath26@xmath27 , the residual long - lived unstable resonances are forced not to decay after this final cut time . </S>",
    "<S> all particles with their phase space coordinates at their respective freeze - out time @xmath28 ( last collisions ) are put into the analyzing program to be discussed below . when studying the time - evolution of the particle correlation ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) , we produce output at @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath25 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34@xmath27 , separately , while other parameters are not altered .    </S>",
    "<S> the  correlation after - burner \" ( crab v3.0@xmath35 ) program @xcite is then adopted for analyzing the interactions of two particles after freeze - out with quantum statistics and final state modifications so that one can construct the hbt correlator to be compared with experimental data . in this work , the strong interaction of pions and kaons is not considered in fsi because of its negligible effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also noticed that the effect of strong fsi influences the final hbt results of neutral @xmath36 source @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath0s , the nuclear modification is not considered in this work for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> we will , however , briefly discuss this issue in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . concerning the contribution of the final state coulomb interaction to the correlator , it is checked for the charged pion - pion and kaon - kaon cases . </S>",
    "<S> one billion pairs are performed at mid - rapidity of single or two correlated particles as stated in @xcite in each crab analyzing run .    in the next step , </S>",
    "<S> we fit the correlator as a three - dimensional gaussian form under the pratt convention ( using root @xcite and the @xmath37-squared method ) , i.e. , the longitudinally co - moving system ( lcms ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the nuclear and coulomb modifications are not considered in the correlator , the fitting function can be expressed in the standard way , @xmath38 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fit1 ] ) , @xmath39 is normally referred to as an incoherence factor . </S>",
    "<S> it might be also affected by many other factors , such as the contaminations , long - lived resonances , or the details of the coulomb modification in fsi . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we regard it as a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath40 are the pratt radii in longitudinal , outward , and sideward directions , while the cross - term @xmath41 plays a role at large rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 is the pair relative momentum @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) in the @xmath17 direction .    </S>",
    "<S> if one considers the coulomb effect in fsi for charged - particle pairs , a bowler - sinyukov method , which has been used in star experiments @xcite , can be exploited in the fitting process :    @xmath45    where the @xmath46 is the coulomb correction factor and depends only on @xmath47 as same as experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath48 is the invariant relative momentum , where @xmath49 is the energy difference of two particles .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the one - dimensional invariant correlation function for pion ( left plot ) , @xmath0 ( left plot ) , and kaon ( right plot ) sources for central au+au reactions at @xmath24 gev . </S>",
    "<S> a transverse momentum @xmath50 cut is not applied . </S>",
    "<S> the pairs are binned with @xmath51mev@xmath52 for pions and kaons while @xmath53mev@xmath52 for @xmath0s due to the small yield of @xmath0s in each event . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit is @xmath54mev@xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the pairs within @xmath55mev@xmath52 are not used for fitting due to the large errors from split and merged tracks in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the left plot shows that the gaussian parameterization is still suitable for pion - pion and @xmath0-@xmath0 correlators if strong and coulomb modifications are not considered in fsi . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the coulomb correction factor influences the correlator of pions at @xmath56mev@xmath52 @xcite which is supported by the present calculation as indicated by the flat @xmath57 ( thin dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the @xmath57 factor in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fit2 ] ) reduces the final hbt radii of pion source only slightly at @xmath58mev@xmath52 , while the reduction of @xmath39 is about @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect of coulomb modification on the hbt radii and the @xmath39 factor was also observed in previous calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the one - dimensional fitting results ( @xmath60 ) for pions and @xmath0s show that the pion s homogeneity length is about twice larger than for @xmath0 s , which implies that more @xmath0s are emitted from the early stage . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the larger @xmath39 factor indicates that @xmath0s are less affected by the decay of resonances at late stage , although some amount of @xmath0s are produced by the decay of @xmath61 resonances . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( right ) shows the @xmath60 of the @xmath62 source which lies between that of the pion and @xmath0 source , also the @xmath39 value of the kaon source is largest , which supports that kaons are produced earliest among the investigated particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for kaons , the coulomb modification alters the correlator up to the large value of @xmath47 , @xmath63mev@xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> although a strong reduction of the @xmath60 is not seen , @xmath39 is reduced by @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb corrected @xmath39 values of pions and kaons match the data much better @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to the fact that the coulomb modification to the kaon - kaon correlation is larger than for the pion - pion correlation , we adopt the bowler - sinyukov fitting method expressed in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> fig.[fig2 ] depicts the calculated @xmath3-dependence of the hbt radii @xmath2 ( top plots ) , @xmath1 ( middle plots ) , and @xmath40 ( bottom plots ) of @xmath71 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath62 ( dash - dotted lines ) sources in central @xmath72 collisions at @xmath73a gev ( left plots ) and at @xmath74a gev ( right plots ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cascade results are compared with data ( solid stars for pion data at both beam energies @xcite , open symbols for kaon data at 158 gev from the na44 and the na49 collaboration @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> one should bear in mind that the kaon data are obtained under slightly different physical cuts from the pion case . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in ref.@xcite , the @xmath75 most central interactions are selected for the central kaon data sample while the @xmath76 most central interactions are selected for pions @xcite . at @xmath77 gev </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( left ) , one can not observe @xmath3-scaling in all hbt directions if the potentials are considered only for formed baryons . </S>",
    "<S> although the calculated @xmath40 of kaons stay on the scaling line , those of @xmath0s are about @xmath81 fm above the scaling line . </S>",
    "<S> further , @xmath2 values of kaons and @xmath0s are larger than the scaling results . in the @xmath1 direction </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the hbt radii of pions , kaons and @xmath0s . </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider potentials for `` pre - formed '' hadrons as discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( right ) shows that the transverse radii @xmath1 and @xmath40 of the pion source nicely follow the scaling line . </S>",
    "<S> however , a steeper @xmath3-dependence of @xmath2 is seen which might be due to the absence of a proper collision term for the `` pre - formed '' hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it is exciting to see that the `` pre - formed '' hadron potential leads to a smaller @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) of kaon pairs as well so that the hbt radii of kaons also follow the scaling line quite well . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the results for @xmath0s also approach towards the scaling line especially at large @xmath50 where the effect of resonance decay is minor because of an early emission . at small </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 , the decay of long - lived resonance @xmath82(1385 ) into @xmath0s enlarges the hbt radii . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the absence of the nuclear modification on fsi might also play a role , which deserves a further investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> based on discussions in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] - [ fig3 ] , we conclude that interactions at the late stage ( including the modifications in fsi ) indeed influences the hbt parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of  pre - formed  hadron interactions does not only solve the hbt  </S>",

    "<S> pre - formed  particle interactions , the @xmath83 ratio increases rapidly up to @xmath85@xmath27 from @xmath86 to @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , considering the `` pre - formed '' hadron potential , the ratio @xmath83 is nearly time independent ( stays at its start value of @xmath88 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of fsi continue to play visible roles ( although relatively weakly after @xmath25@xmath27 ) on the @xmath39 factor , which is also consistent with the visible suppressing effect of the coulomb modification of fsi on the @xmath39 value from the analysis of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the `` pre - formed '' hadron potential reduces the @xmath39 further to approach the data .    </S>",
    "<S> for central collisions , the hbt radii can be ( approximately ) analytically obtained under the assumptions of thermalization and gaussian - source shape and be expressed as @xcite ,    @xmath89    [ eqrlrors ]    here the space - time coordinates @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are relative distances to their `` effective source centers '' ( @xmath94 ) : @xmath95 . </S>",

    "<S> however , with a density dependent potential for `` pre - formed '' particles from string fragmentation , the hbt radii of pion and kaon sources , even those of the @xmath0 source , are seen to follow the @xmath3-scaling line @xmath4 fairly well . </S>",
    "<S> the strong and coulomb interactions at late stage are observed to influence the hbt radii and the @xmath39 factor . </S>",
    "<S> the hbt `` t - puzzle '' in many calculations exhibited by the larger @xmath83 ratios of pion and kaon sources than data can only be solved by the `` pre - formed '' hadron potential which dominates _ at the early stage _ of hics . </S>"
