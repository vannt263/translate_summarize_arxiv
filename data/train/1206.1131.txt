    "in recent 25 years , considerable progress has been made in loop quantum gravity ( lqg)@xcite , which is a non - perturbative and background independent quantization of general relativity .",
    "a particular feature of lqg is to to inherit the core concept of general relativity that the fundamental physical theory should be background independent .",
    "the construction of lqg inspired the research on spin foam models ( sfms ) @xcite , which are proposed as the path - integral formulation for lqg . in sfms ,",
    "the transition amplitude between physical quantum states is formulated as a sum over histories of all physically appropriate states .",
    "the heuristic picture is the following .",
    "one considers a 4-dimensional spacetime region m bounded by two spacelike 3-surfaces , which would correspond to the initial and final states for the path integral . the feature of sfms is to employ the spin network states in lqg to represent the initial and final states .",
    "a certain path between the two boundaries is a quantum 4-geometry interpolated between the two spin networks .",
    "the interpolated spin foams can be constructed by considering the dual triangulation of m and coloring its surfaces with half integers and edges with suitable intertwiners . in order to obtain the physical inner product between the two boundary states",
    ", one has to sum over all possible triangulations and colorings @xcite .",
    "this is certainly difficult to be achieved .",
    "thus it is desirable to examine the idea and construction of sfms by certain simplified models .",
    "it is well known that the idea and technique of canonical lqg are successfully carried out in the symmetry - reduced models , known as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite .",
    "because of the homogeneity ( and isotropy ) , the infinite degrees of freedom of gravity have been reduced to finite ones in lqc @xcite .",
    "hence lqc provides a simple arena to test the ideas and constructions of the full lqg .",
    "therefore , it was proposed to test the idea and construction of sfms by lqc models @xcite .",
    "it was shown in refs.@xcite that the transition amplitude in the deparameterized lqc of @xmath0 friedmann universe equals the physical inner product in the timeless framework , and concrete evidence has been provided in support of the general paradigm underlying sfms through the lens of lqc . how to achieve local spinfoam expansion in lqc was also studied in refs .",
    "recently , the effective hamiltonian constraint of @xmath0 lqc was derived from the path integral formulation in timeless framework in ref.@xcite , and the effective measure introduces some conceptual subtleties in arriving at the wkb approximation . the path integrals and effective hamiltonians of lqc for @xmath1 frw models are also derived @xcite .",
    "the coherent state functional integrals are also proposed to study quantum cosmological models @xcite . however , in canonical lqc , there are some quantization ambiguities in constructing the hamiltonian constraint operator .",
    "theoretically , the quantization method which inherits more features from full lqg would be preferred . in spatially flat frw model ,",
    "two alternative versions of hamiltonian constraint operator are proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the big bang singularity resolution , correct classical limit and re - collapse of an expanding universe because of higher - order quantum effect are obtained .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the alternative effective dynamics of lqc from the viewpoint of path integral .",
    "the models which we are considering is the spatially flat frw models with a massless scalar field .",
    "we will formulate the path integrals for two different proposed dynamics of lqc in both timeless and deparameterized frameworks .",
    "the multiple group averaging method proposed in ref.@xcite is employed .",
    "it turns out that the alternative effective hamiltonians derived from the two different viewpoints are equivalent to each other . moreover , the first - order modified friedmann equations can be derived , and the quantum bounces for contracting universe will also be obtained in both kinds of dynamics . in section 2 , we will introduce the basic frameworks of lqc and the path integral approach of multiple group averaging .",
    "then we will derive the path integral formulation and effective hamiltonian of alternative quantization model i and model ii in sections 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "finally a summary will be given in section 5 .",
    "we are consider the spatially flat frw universe filled with a massless scalar field . in the kinematical setting , it is convenient to introduce an elementary cell @xmath2 in the spatial manifold and restricts all integrations to this cell .",
    "fixing a fiducial flat metric @xmath3 and denoting by @xmath4 the volume of @xmath2 in this geometry , the physical volume reads @xmath5 .",
    "the gravitational phase space variables the connections and the density weighted triads  can be expressed as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are a set of orthonormal co - triads and triads compatible with @xmath3 and adapted to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath9 is related to the scale factor @xmath10 via @xmath11 .",
    "the fundamental poisson bracket is given by : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the newton s constant and @xmath14 the barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint reads @xmath15 . to apply the area gap @xmath16 of full lqg to lqc @xcite , it is convenient to introduce variable @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and new conjugate variables @xcite : @xmath20 the new canonical pair satisfies @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "the matter phase space consists of canonical variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 which satisfy @xmath24 . to mimic lqg ,",
    "the polymer - like representation is employed to quantize the gravity sector .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space for gravity then reads @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the bhor compactification of the real line and @xmath27 is the haar measure on it @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the eigenstates of volume operator @xmath28 , which are labeled by real number @xmath29 , constitute an orthonomal basis in @xmath30 as @xmath31 . for the scalar matter sector",
    ", one just uses the standard schrodinger representation for its quantization , where the kinematical hilbert space is @xmath32 .",
    "the total kinematical hilbert space of the system is a tensor product , @xmath33 , of the above two hilbert spaces . as a totally constrained system , the dynamics of this model",
    "is reflected in the hamiltonian constraint @xmath34 .",
    "quantum mechanically , physical states are those satisfying quantum constraint equation @xmath35 which is not difficult to be rewritten as an klein - gordon like equation @xcite : @xmath36 eq .",
    "indicates that we can get physical states by group averaging kinematical states as @xcite @xmath37 and thus the physical inner product of two states reads @xmath38 as is known , in timeless framework the transition amplitude equals to the physical inner product @xcite , i.e. , @xmath39 on the other hand , eq . can also be written as @xmath40 the similarity between eq .",
    "and klein - gorden equation suggests that one can regard @xmath22 as internal time , with respect to which gravitational field evolves . in this deparameterized framework , we focus on positive frequency solutions , i.e. , those satisfying @xmath41 the transition amplitude in deparameterized framework is then given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are eigenstates of volume operator in @xmath45 , and @xmath22 is the internal time .    starting with , we now consdier the transition amplitude of path integral under timeless framework . in order to compute @xmath46 ,",
    "a straightforward way is to split the exponential into @xmath47 identical pieces and insert complete basis as in @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath48 is the group - averaging parameter which goes from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , it is unclear whether @xmath48 could be treated as the time variable @xmath51 in non - relativistic quantum mechanics path integral .",
    "we thus consider alternative path integral formulation of multiple group - averaging @xcite .",
    "here one single group averaging ( [ group average ] ) is generalized as multiple ones : @xmath52 in order to trace the power for expansion , we re - scale the parameters by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . then becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "next , we are going to insert a set of complete basis at each knot .",
    "notice that @xmath57 is the eigenstate of both volume operator and scalar operator simultaneously in @xmath58 , which is written as @xmath59 for short , and @xmath60 thus , we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 have been set . since the constraint operator @xmath63 has been separated into gravitational part and material part , which live in @xmath45 and @xmath64 separately , we could calculate the exponential on each kinematical space separately .",
    "for the material part , one gets @xmath65 as for the gravitational part , in the limit @xmath66 , the operator @xmath67 can be expanded to the first order , and hence we get @xmath68",
    "in this section , we employ one of the alternative hamiltonian constraint operators for lqc proposed in @xcite , where the _ extrinsic curvature _ @xmath69 in the lorentz term of the gravitational hamiltonian constraint was quantized directly following the procedure in full lqg . using the simplification treatment in @xcite",

    "( [ timeless f2 ] ) as @xmath79 .",
    "\\label{effc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this effective hamiltonian constraint , we can explore the effective dynamics of universe by the modified friedmann equation : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the matter density and @xmath82 is a constant .",
    "this modified friedmann equation coincides with the one in @xcite if we ignore the higher - order quantum corrections therein .",
    "it is easy to see that if the matter density increase to @xmath83 , the hubble parameter would be zero and the _ bounce _ could occur for a contracting universe . on the other hand , in the classical region of large scale",
    ", we have @xmath84 and hence eq . ( [ fdm eq1 ] ) reduces to the standard classical friedmann equation : @xmath85 .",
    "besides the _ timeless _ framework , we can also employ the above group - averaging viewpoint for the deparameterized framework . to this end",
    ", we define a new constraint operator @xmath86 .",

    "it is easy to see that the friedmann equation ( [ fdm eq2 ] ) can also reduce to the classical one when @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , eq.([fdm eq2 ] ) coincides with the corresponding effective friedmann equation in @xcite if the higher - order quantum corrections therein are neglected .",
    "similarly , we can also get the deparameterized amplitude : @xmath115\\nonumber\\\\ = & c'\\int\\mathcal{d}v\\int\\mathcal{d}b~\\exp\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int d\\phi(\\sqrt{12\\pi g\\hbar^2v^2\\sin^2{b}(1+\\gamma^2\\sin^2{b } ) } -{\\hbar\\dot{v}b}),\\label{damplitude3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives an effective hamiltonian : @xmath116 the evolution of @xmath29 and @xmath117 with respect to @xmath22 can be obtained from this effective hamiltonian as : @xmath118 which again coincide with the effective eq.([fdm eq2 ] ) and predict the same bounce when @xmath104 . hence , the corresponding effective dynamics of this model in canonical theory is also confirmed at first order by the path integral .",
    "the motivations to study alternative dynamics of lqc are in two folds .",
    "first , since there are quantization ambiguities in constructing the hamiltonian constraint operator in lqc , it is crucial to check whether the key features of lqc , such as the quantum bounce and effective scenario , are robust against the ambiguities .",
    "second , since lqc serves as a simple arena to test ideas and constructions induced in the full lqg , it is important to implement those treatments from the full theory to lqc as more as possible .",
    "unlike the usual treatment in spatially flat and homogeneous models , the euclidean and lorentz terms have to be quantized separately in full lqg .",
    "therefore , this kind of quantization procedure which kept the distinction of the lorentz and euclidean terms was proposed as alternative dynamics for lqc @xcite .",
    "it was shown in the resulted canonical effective theory that the classical big bang is again replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "hence it is desirable to study such kind of prediction from different perspective .",
    "moreover , it is desirable to examine the idea and construction of sfms by the simplified models of lqc .",
    "the main results of the present paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "the path integral formulation is constructed for spatially flat frw models under the framework of lqc with two alternative dynamics . in both models",
    ", we can express the transition amplitude in both the timeless and the deparameterized frameworks by multiple group averaging procedure .",
    "we can derive the effective hamiltonians from both viewpoints .",
    "it turns out that in both models the resulted effective dynamics from the timeless and the deparameterized path integrals are equivalent to each other .",
    "this indicates the equivalence between two frameworks of path integral .",
    "moreover , the modified friedmann equations for both models are also obtained and coincide with the corresponding equations in @xcite if the higher - order quantum corrections therein are neglected .",
    "this indicates the equivalence of the canonical approach and the path integral approach in lqc .",
    "since our path integral approach inherits significant features of sfms , it provides certain good evidence to support the scheme of sfms . in both models , the _ quantum bounce _ will replace the _",
    "big bang singularity _ due to the modified friedmann equations when the matter density increase to the magnitude of _",
    "planck density_. hence the quantum bounce resolution of big bang singularity in lqc is robust against the quantization ambiguities of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "moreover , the alternative modified friedmann equations ( [ fdm eq1 ] ) and ( [ fdm eq2 ] ) set up new arenas for studying phenomenological issues of lqc .",
