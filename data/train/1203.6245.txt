    "the search for a functional quantum computer ( qc ) started in the mid - nineties , and by the year 2000 many systems had been considered as candidates for its physical implementation.@xcite among them , the 1998 proposal for a si - based qc by kane  @xcite raised special interest due to objective and relevant factors favoring si , such as the accumulated know - how in processing si for advanced device applications , the relatively long spin coherence times and the possibility of isotopic purification processing , further increasing coherence times.@xcite    on the other hand , the conduction electrons in si are not in a well defined single bloch state .",
    "instead , the si conduction band is six - fold degenerate , with minima ( valleys ) along the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 crystallographic directions .",
    "this imposes limitations to the spin manipulation and coherence.@xcite    it was recently proposed to encode quantum information directly into the valley degree of freedom , converting the spurious valley hilbert subspace into a useful ingredient for a qc.@xcite naturally , this raises fundamental questions , such as how to promote controlled inter - valley transitions , to what extent valley degeneracy can be lifted , and how sensitive such operations are to fabrication - related parameters .",
    "the valley degree of freedom also affects transport properties in si nanostructures : valley degeneracy has been recently shown to produce a valley kondo effect in a singly doped si fin field effect transistor.@xcite    we study here the valley degree of freedom for one electron bound to a donor  more specifically substitutional p in si  tunnel - coupled to a ( 001 ) si / sio@xmath6 interface at a distance @xmath7 from the donor .",
    "the barrier material is taken to be sio@xmath6 for definiteness , but it could in principle be any high quality interface , such as si / sige .",
    "the evolution of the inequivalent valley contributions is obtained by mapping the low - lying manifold ( following in more detail the three lowest energy states ) as an electric field pulls the electron away from its `` hydrogenic '' configuration at the donor site towards the state at the interface .",
    "a ground state electron confined in the direction perpendicular to the interface in the triangular potential formed by the barrier and the electric field [ see fig .  [ esquema](a ) ] , still remains bound to the donor core potential , leading to localization in the in - plane direction .",
    "@xcite for low fields , the electron in the ground state is essentially confined at the donor , where the lowest energy manifold is split by the tetrahedral crystal field environment into states with distinct contributions from the six valleys . in particular",

    "the donor is ionized , and its electron is shuttled to the interface . at the interface ,",
    "the valley levels split into a four - fold degenerate excited state , consisting of @xmath8 and @xmath9 bloch states , and a lower manifold spanned by the @xmath10 valleys .",
    "the two lowest levels are only slightly separated due to the abrupt interface breaking the @xmath5 reflection symmetry ( generally less than @xmath11 mev separation  @xcite ) .",

    "the stark shifted spectrum of p donors in bulk si ( no barrier material ) is discussed in ref .",
    "the effective mass approach is adopted and the envelope functions are expressed as a combination of atomic - like orbitals .",

    "these references elaborate numerical procedures are adopted leading to accurate results .",
    "here we get good qualitative agreement for the spectrum in comparison with these previous works , and we explore a complementary aspect - namely the valley - composition evolution of the low - lying states under an increasing external field . the same geometry has been previously studied in a two - valley model @xmath12 where the valley - composition analysis is not accessible .",
    "@xcite    we discuss here the evolution of the valley quantum number as a function of the electric field for field values in the range where the hybridization between donor and interface states takes place .",

    "[ fig : d4-vs - theta ] may play an important role in applications involving the donor / barrier system .",

    "an intrinsically large @xmath1 , like the one considered in figs .",
    "[ fig : eigenvaluesd4 ] , [ fig : eigenvectorsd4d5 ] , and [ fig : d4-vs - theta ] , is also needed , as well as a small @xmath7 ( @xmath162 ) to guarantee a sufficiently large gap at anticrossing .",
    "on the other hand , following the adiabatic theorem , the donor - interface shuttling would be prohibitively slow for @xmath163 due to the crossing between the ground state and the first excited level .",
    "another phase - related effect occurs due to the variable pinning point in the bloch functions @xmath164 [ ] , which produces a periodic dependence of the valley - orbit splitting on @xmath7 leading to the closing of the gap at anticrossings at some particular values of @xmath7 [ ] .",
    "if instead of the spin we want to use the valley degree of freedom to define qubits , a controllable valley - orbit coupling is required.@xcite this is achieved if the energy separation of two states with the same envelope function but different valley compositions ( therefore , different oscillations in the atomic scale ) varies significantly with the external applied fields .",
    "this situation can be attained above @xmath104 when the two lowest eigenstates are mainly interface states involving different combinations of the @xmath5 and @xmath55 valleys .",
    "a strong dependence of the splitting with electric field can be found close to @xmath104 in some cases .",

    "[ fig : d4-vs - theta](g ) ( corresponding to @xmath138 ) the closing of the gap between the two lowest eigenvalues produces a fast decrease of the splitting as the electric field is lowered from @xmath165 to @xmath166 kv / cm . also , for smaller values of @xmath56 , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : s&n ] , the interface - donor hybridization leads to a relatively large gap compared to @xmath56 and consequently the splitting increases fast from @xmath165 to @xmath166 kv / cm .",
    "however , the variation of the level splitting on the electric field is stronger when the donor - interface hybridization is large",
    ". this hybridization mixes valleys in the different directions , potentially producing decoherence in the valley sector .    on the other extreme , @xmath137 , fig .",
    "[ fig : d4-vs - theta](a ) reveals that the upper valley composition crosses the second excited state : as a consequence , the valley information would be lost .    in summary",
    ", we show that both the modulus and the phase of @xmath56 affect the quantum behavior of donor electrons in si near an interface .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is hard to predict , and its calculation probably requires knowledge of the atomistic distribution at the interface and a complete electronic structure description of the combined si / structured interface / barrier system .",
    "it is not clear whether a direct experimental measure is possible .",
    "we propose that measurement of the separate gaps may provide an estimate of @xmath2 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
