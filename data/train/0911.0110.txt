    "one of the important problems in the probability theory is to find an appropriate measure of the difference or the statistical _ divergence _ of two probability distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this measure quantifies the degree of the similarity between them . in the mathematical statistics",
    "the divergence of two probability distributions is introduced as follows : if @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] are two probability spaces then the so - called ( csiszr s ) f - divergence of probability distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given as @xmath4\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 represents a convex function in the interval @xmath6 and strictly convex for @xmath7 @xcite .    among the existing divergence measures of two discrete probabilities , @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] ,",
    "the kullback - leibler statistical divergence @xcite @xmath10 is perhaps best known and most widely used .",
    "this is why this measure has several desirable properties , such as nonnegativity and additivity , which are crucial in its applications .",
    "@xmath11 is _ not _ symmetrical regarding the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath12 . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the inequality holds @xmath14 the minimum of @xmath13 is obtained iff @xmath15 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    apart of the kullback - leibler statistical divergence , a number of other divergence measures , depending on certain parameters , have been proposed and intensively studied by rnyi @xcite , kapur @xcite , kullback and leiber @xcite , havrda and charvat @xcite , tsallis @xcite , @xcite .",
    "some of them satisfy the convexity condition only for restricted values of the corresponding parameters .",
    "however , the kullback - leibler , rnyi , havrda - charvat , tsallis and the trigonometrical @xcite statistical divergences require generally @xmath16 whenever @xmath17 . from point of view of their application , this is not a desirable property because just such situations we often encounter in the theoretical physics especially in statistical and quantum physics .    in the next sections , we exploit one of the first statistical divergence measure , that was proposed in the literature , the bhattachryya divergence of @xmath0 and @xmath12 which is symmetrical regarding the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath12 and",
    "does not suffer from the above - mentioned shortcoming .",
    "we attempt to apply the bhattacharyya statistical divergence to the quantification of the degree of similarity of two quantum observables .",
    "the bhattacharyya statistical divergence of the discrete probability distributions @xmath18 is defined as @xcite @xmath19 this divergence has the following properties : + ( i ) it becomes its maximal value equal to @xmath20 when the probability distributions @xmath0 and @xmath12 are identical .",
    "+ ( ii ) its minimal value is zero when the components of @xmath0 and @xmath12 do not overlap .",
    "+ ( iii ) its value lies in the interval @xmath21 $ ] and expresses the degree how much the probability distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath12 are similar .",
    "+ ( iv ) it is _ symmetrical _ regarding the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",
    "+ ( v ) @xmath22 satisfies the properties of nonnegativity , finiteness and boundedness .",
    "+ ( vi ) it can be straightforward extended for more than two probability distributions @xcite .",
    "the bhattacharyya statistical divergence of @xmath0 and @xmath12 has a simple geometrical interpretation .",
    "consider the following vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 . according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the similarity measure of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is simply the scalar product of @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath28 and @xmath26 represent the unit vectors in @xmath29 its scalar product is equal to the cosine of angle between @xmath25 and @xmath26 which , of course , has the properties ( i)-(iv ) .",
    "consider two observables @xmath30 , @xmath31 with hermitian operators @xmath32 , @xmath33 in an n - dimensional hilbert space , whose corresponding complete orthonormal sets of eigenvectors @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 are disjointed and have nondegenerate spectra .",
    "let @xmath37 be a normalized state vector of n - dimensional hilbert space then it holds @xmath38    accordingly , the components of the probability distributions @xmath39 and @xmath40 associated with the observables @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath41 @xmath42 inserting eqs.(2a ) and ( 2b ) into eq.(1 ) we get @xmath43    if @xmath44 then @xmath45 for @xmath46 and eqs.(2a ) and ( 2b ) becomes @xmath47 hence , for @xmath48 it follows @xmath49 . given the state vector @xmath50 and operators @xmath51 the considered statistical divergence of their probability distributions can be generally determined .",
    "to each operator , a ray in the hilbert space can be assigned .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 gives the closeness of different rays in hilbert space .",
    "if these rays are identical then their bhattacharyya divergence @xmath52 is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "if they are perpendicular to each other then @xmath52 becomes zero .",
    "generally , @xmath52 @xmath53 and the corresponding rays of these operators in hilbert space are identical , i.e. the cosine of angle between them is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 .",
    "next , we consider the case of two _ non - commuting",
    "_ observables .",
    "consider two observables @xmath30 and @xmath31 with non - commuting hermitian operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 in an n - dimensional hilbert space , whose corresponding complete orthonormal sets of eigenvectors @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 are disjointed and have nondegenerate spectra .",
    "let @xmath37 be a normalized state vector of n - dimensional hilbert space then it holds @xmath57 according the quantum transformation theory we have @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the elements of the transformation matrix @xmath61 between the observables @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath62    inserting eq.(3 ) into eq.(1 ) we get for the bhattacharyya statistical divergence of the probability distributions @xmath39 and @xmath63 the expression @xmath64    given the state vector @xmath50 and the components of @xmath61 , the divergence of the probability distributions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be generally determined .",
    "next , we present an example for determining of bhattacharyya divergence of two concrete _ complementary _ observables describing a simple quantum system .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will consider the complementary observables in a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "such system represents a particle with spin @xmath65 @xcite . determining the probability distributions of the components @xmath66 and @xmath67 we can calculate the similarity measure of their probability distributions .",
    "its wave functions in z - representation takes the form @xmath70 . according eq.(3 ) , the probability @xmath71 and @xmath72 that @xmath67 is projected on @xmath73 and @xmath74 is @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , so the corresponding probabilistic schema becomes        now , we express @xmath77 and @xmath78 by means of new variables @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the following way @xmath81 in these variables , we obtain for @xmath66 and @xmath67 the following probability distributions @xmath82 and @xmath83 the similarity measure of these probability distributions consists of two terms @xmath84 where      if @xmath66 occurs in one of its eigenstates , i.e. @xmath87 or @xmath88 , then the first or second term in eq.(4 ) becomes zero and we obtain the minimal value of @xmath89 equal to @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 attains its maximal value equal to @xmath20 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 the 3d - plot @xmath91 is given in fig . 1 .",
    "this graph shows that in the vicinity of @xmath95 and for @xmath96 $ ] a hump occurs , where the probability distributions are almost similar .",
    "@xmath91 never drops under the value @xmath97 , therefore it holds @xmath98 while s(p : q ) for two commuting observables in two - dimensional hilbert space can attain arbitrary value , the similarity measure of the probability distributions of the investigating non - commuting observables , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , is bounded by the value @xmath97 .",
    "we note that two observables @xmath30 , @xmath31 in an @xmath99-dimensional hilbert space are said to be complementary ( to each other ) if their transformation matrix has the form @xcite @xmath100 complementary observables can be considered as a generalization to higher dimensions of spin-1/2 orthogonal system @xcite .",
    "hence , we can proceed similarly also for two complementary observables in a general n - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the concept of bhattacharyya statistical divergence is quite independent of quantum mechanics and can be defined in any probability space .",
    "hence , apart from the application of the similarity measure in quantum physics it can also be applied to theory of the physical measurement .",
    "it may serve as a certain degree of the reliance of a physical measurement .",
    "suppose that in two different laboratories the probabilities of the decay modes of an elementary particle are measured .",
    "generally , the different probability distributions of the individual decay modes are obtained in each laboratory . to determine the reliance of the measurement we can insert the measured probability distributions in formula ( 1 ) .",
    "here , the simple rule holds : the large is the value of @xmath101 the more reliable is the corresponding measurement .",
