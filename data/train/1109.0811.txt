    "since the last quarter of twentieth century , using partial differential equations to formulate and solve geometric problems has become a trend and a dominating force . a new area called geometric analysis was born .",
    "when looking back at the history of geometric analysis , one could see numerous success stories of utilizing differential equations to tackle important problems in geometry , topology and physics .",
    "typical and important examples would include yau s solution to the calabi conjecture using the complex monge - ampere equation ( see yau @xcite ) , schoen s solution of the yamabe conjecture ( see schoen @xcite ) , schoen - yau s proof of the positive mass conjecture ( see schoen - yau @xcite ) , donaldson s work on 4-dimensional smooth manifolds using the yang - mills equation ( see donaldson @xcite ) , and recently , perelman s solution to the century - old poincar@xmath4 conjecture using hamilton s beautiful theory on the ricci flow , which is just a nonlinear version of the classical heat equation ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "however , despite all these success , the equations studied and utilized in geometry so far are almost exclusively of elliptic or parabolic type . with few exceptions , hyperbolic equations",
    "have not yet found their way into the study of geometric or topological problems .",
    "more recently , kong et al introduced the hyperbolic geometric flow which is a fresh start of an attempt to introduce hyperbolic partial differential equations into the realm of geometry ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the kind of flow is a very natural tool to understand the wave character of metrics , the wave phenomenon of curvatures , the evolution of manifolds and their structures ( see @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new geometric flow with rotational invariance .",
    "this flow is described by , formally a system of parabolic partial differential equations , essentially a coupled system of hyperbolic - parabolic partial differential equations with rotational invariance .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath5 be a family of hypersurfaces in the @xmath6-dimensional euclidean space @xmath7 with coordinates @xmath8 , without loss of generality , we may assume that the family of hypersurfaces @xmath5 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a vector - valued smooth function of @xmath3 and @xmath11 , the new flow considered here is given by the following evolution equation @xmath12 is the laplacian operator , and @xmath13 stands for the norm of the vector @xmath14 in @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) possesses the rotational invariance which plays an important role in the present paper .",
    "we are interested in the deformation of a smooth closed contractible hypersurface @xmath15 under the flow ( [ 1.2 ] ) , that is , we consider how the hypersurface @xmath16 is smoothly deformed , say , embedded into a smooth family of hypersurfaces depending on a time parameter .",
    "this can be reduced to solve the cauchy problem for ( [ 1.2 ] ) with the initial data @xmath17 obviously , in the present situation , @xmath18 is a vector - valued periodic function , say , defined on @xmath19^n$ ] . in section 2 , we shall prove    if @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) admits a unique global smooth solution on @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , the following theorem will be proved in section 3 .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 are all constants , i.e. , @xmath24 , suppose furthermore that @xmath18 is a smooth vector - valued periodic function with the period @xmath19^n$ ] , and satisfies @xmath25^n.\\ ] ] then the cauchy problem ( [ 1.2])-([1.3 ] ) has a global smooth solution @xmath26 , and the solution satisfies @xmath27^n}|x_0(\\theta_1,\\cdots,\\theta_n)|d\\theta_1\\cdots d\\theta_n \\qquad { \\rm as } \\;\\;\\ ; t\\nearrow \\infty.\\ ] ] moreover , if the hypersurfaces undergo suitable homotheties , then the normalized hypersurfaces converge to a sphere in the @xmath2-topology as @xmath3 goes to the infinity .",
    "the geometric meaning of the result in theorem 1.2 can be shown in the following figure :    ( 198,174 )    in the case @xmath28 , theorem 1.1 covers the well - known theorem of gage and hamilton in @xcite for the curvature flow of plane curves ; while for the case of general @xmath29 , theorem 1.1 covers the famous result of huisken in @xcite on the flow by mean curvature of convex surfaces into spheres . in particular , we would like to point out that , in theorem 1.1 , we do not require the assumption that the hypersurface is convex .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we prove the global existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions for the cauchy problem ( [ 1.2 ] ) , ( [ 1.3 ] ) ; sections 3 is devoted to the proof of theorem 1.2 ; in section 4 , we state conclusions obtained in the present paper and give some open problems . in appendix",
    ", we investigate the time - asymptotic behavior of global smooth solutions for the equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "this section is devoted to the global existence and uniqueness of smooth solution of the following equation @xmath30 is a given smooth vector - valed function , @xmath31 is the laplacian operator , and @xmath13 stands for the norm of the vector @xmath14 in @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 then it is easy to verify that the equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath34 and @xmath35 for smooth solutions .",
    "we now consider the cauchy problem for the equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) , equivalently , the system ( 2.1a)-(2.1b ) with initial data @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a given scalar function of @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a given vector - valued function of @xmath38 . in",
