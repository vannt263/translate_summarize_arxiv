    "how galaxies build up their stellar mass is a central question in galaxy formation . within the broadly successful cold dark matter scenario",
    ", gas is believed to accrete gravitationally into growing dark matter halos , and then radiative processes enable the gas to decouple from non - baryonic matter and eventually settle into a star - forming disk  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , many complications arise when testing this scenario against observations , as the stellar assembly of galaxies involves a host of other processes including star formation , kinetic and thermal feedback from various sources , and merger - induced activity , all of which are poorly understood in comparison to halo assembly .",
    "a key insight into gas accretion processes is the recent recognition of the importance of  cold mode \" accretion  @xcite , where gas infalling from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) does not pass through an accretion shock on its way to forming stars .",
    "simulations and analytic models show that cold mode dominates global accretion at @xmath14  @xcite , and dominates accretion in all halos with masses @xmath15m@xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the central features of cold mode accretion are that it is ( 1 ) _ rapid _ ( 2 ) _ smooth _ , and ( 3 ) _ steady_. it is rapid because it is limited by the free - fall time and not the cooling time ; it is smooth because most of the accretion occurs in small lumps and not through major mergers  @xcite ; and it is steady because it is governed by the gravitational potential of the slowly growing halo .",
    "a consequence of cold mode accretion is that the star formation rate is a fairly steady function of time  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which results in a tight relationship between the stellar mass @xmath2 and the star formation rate sfr .",
    "hence simulations of star - forming galaxies generically predict a tight relationship with @xmath17sfr that evolves slowly with redshift . in detail ,",
    "a slope slightly below unity occurs owing to the growth of hot halos around higher - mass galaxies that retards accretion .",
    "the stellar mass  star formation rate ( @xmath0sfr ) relation for star forming galaxies has now been observed out to @xmath18 , thanks to improving multiwavelength surveys .",
    "as expected from models , the relationship is seen to be fairly tight from @xmath19 , with a slope just below unity and a scatter of @xmath20  dex  @xcite .",
    "it also evolves downwards in amplitude to lower redshift in lock step fashion , suggesting a quiescent global quenching mechanism such as a lowering of the ambient cosmic density , again as expected in models .",
    "the range of data used to quantify this evolution is impressive : @xcite used the aegis multi - wavelength survey in the extended groth strip to quantify the @xmath2-sfr relation from @xmath21 ; @xcite used goods at @xmath22 and sdss spectra at @xmath23 ; and @xcite used star - forming bzk - selected galaxies with _ spitzer _ , x - ray , and radio follow - up to study the relation at @xmath24 . in each case , a careful accounting was done of both direct uv and re - radiated infrared photons to measure the total galaxy sfr , paying particular attention to contamination from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) emission ( discussed in  [ sec : syst ] ) .",
    "multiwavelength data covering the rest - optical were employed to accurately estimate @xmath2 . this broad agreement in @xmath0sfr slope , scatter , and qualitative evolution between model predictions and these data lends support to the idea that cold mode accretion dominates in these galaxies .",
    "yet all is not well for theory .",
    "closer inspection reveals that the _ amplitude _ of the @xmath0sfr relation evolves with time in a way that is inconsistent with model expectations .",
    "this disagreement is fairly generic , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , arising in both hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models , and is fairly insensitive to feedback implementation .",
    "the sense of the disagreement is that going to higher redshifts , the observed sfrs are higher , and/or stellar masses lower , than predicted in current models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to understand the implications of the observed @xmath0sfr relation for our theoretical view of how galaxies accumulate stellar mass . in ",
    "[ sec : tact ] it is argued that @xmath0sfr amplitude evolution implies a typical galaxy star formation history that is difficult to reconcile with not only model expectations , but also other observations of high-@xmath9 galaxies .",
    "possible systematic effects that may bias the estimation of sfr and @xmath2 are considered in  [ sec : syst ] , and it is argued that none of them are obvious candidates to explain the discrepancy .",
    "finally a speculative avenue for reconciliation is considered , namely that the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) has a characteristic mass that evolves with redshift (  [ sec : imf ] ) .",

    "note that these hydro simulations do not include any feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , or any process that explicitly truncates star formation in massive galaxies , hence they do not reproduce the evolution of passive galaxies . here",
    "the focus is on star - forming galaxies only , with the assumption that galaxies are quickly squelched to become passive and so do not appear in star - forming selected samples  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the millenium sam produces excellent agreement at @xmath13 , having broadly been tuned to do so . by @xmath47 ,",
    "the predicted hydro simulation slopes are similar to that observed by @xcite though steeper than seen by @xcite , but more importantly the amplitude is low by @xmath48 . at @xmath38 ,",
    "this trend continues , with a @xmath49 amplitude offset .",
    "the millenium sam has a slope that remains near the @xmath13 value , hence it is somewhat shallower than observed at @xmath8 , but the amplitude evolves slowly much like in the hydro simulations .",
    "the rapid evolution in observed @xmath0sfr amplitude has been noted by several authors  @xcite , along with the fact that it is more rapid than in the millenium sam  @xcite .",
    "the new aspect demonstrated here is that the disagreement persists for current hydrodynamic simulations , and as will be shown in the next section this is true regardless of the main free parameter in such models , namely feedback implementation .",
    "the slope and scatter are a direct reflection of the similarity in the shape of galaxy star formation histories ( sfh ) among various models and at various masses . for a galaxy observed at time @xmath50 , neglecting mass loss from stellar evolution ,",
    "@xmath51 the integral depends purely on the _ form _ of the sfh up to @xmath50 .",
    "so long as the sfh form does not vary significantly with @xmath2 , the slope of @xmath0sfr will be near unity , and so long as the current sfr is similar to the recent past - averaged one , the scatter will be small .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the observed tight scatter of @xmath52  dex implies that the bulk of star - forming galaxies can not be undergoing large bursts ; this will be discussed further in  [ sec : tact ] . this is consistent with a fairly steady mode of galaxy assembly as generically predicted by cold mode accretion .",
    "note however that the reverse conclusion does not necessarily hold , in the sense that a slope near unity is not uniquely indicative of a steady mode of galaxy formation ; other scenarios ( such as the staged galaxy formation model of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be constructed to reproduce a slope near unity , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : tact ] .",
    "example galaxy sfhs from the @xmath53 momentum - driven outflow hydro simulation are shown in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : sfrmstar ] , for a range of @xmath13 stellar masses from @xmath54 , in 100  myr bins .",
    "they are remarkably self - similar , and generally quite smooth .",
    "the increased variance in smaller galaxies owes to discreteness effects in spawning star particles ( these sfhs are computed from the history of galaxy star particles rather than the instantaneous sfr at each time ) ; the true scatter in instantaneous sfr increases only mildly at small masses , from @xmath55  dex at @xmath56 to @xmath57  dex at @xmath58 , as shown in figure  [ fig : sfrmstar ] .",
    "the early simulated sfhs are characterized by a rapid rise in star formation to @xmath59 , corresponding to rapid early halo growth  @xcite .",
    "next , there is a period of roughly constant star formation from @xmath60 ; this will be the key epoch for the present work .",
    "finally , at @xmath61 the star formation rates decline modestly , with more massive systems showing greater decline .",
    "this pattern reflects the changing a balance between the growth of potential wells being able to attract more matter , and cosmic expansion which lowers the ambient igm density and infall rates .",
    "it is qualitatively similar to the sfh inferred for the milky way . in the models ,",
    "the fact that the sfh depends weakly on @xmath2 gives rise to @xmath17sfr , and the fact that merger - driven starbursts are not a significant growth path for galaxy stellar mass  @xcite gives rise to the small scatter .",
    "in detail a slope slightly below unity occurs because more massive galaxies tend to have their accretion curtailed by hot halos  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in  natural downsizing \"  @xcite .",
    "note that the sfrs of individual galaxies in simulations do not drop by a large amount over a hubble time . even for the most massive star forming galaxies today",
    ", the sfr in simulations drops only be a factor of few since @xmath38 , and smaller galaxies show essentially no drop .",
    "meanwhile , the amplitude of @xmath2-sfr drops by nearly an order of magnitude in the models , and even more in the data .",
    "so the amplitude evolution owes predominantly to the growth of @xmath2 of individual galaxies . in other words ,",
    "models indicate that the @xmath0sfr relation does nt evolve downwards in sfr so much as upwards in @xmath2 .",
    "overall , while the slope and scatter of the @xmath0sfr relation are in broad agreement , there is a stark and generic discrepancy in the amplitude evolution between the models and data .",
    "the agreement in slope and scatter is an encouraging sign that our understanding of gas accretion processes is reasonably sound .",
    "examining the discrepancy in amplitude evolution is the focus of the remainder of this paper .",
    "-0.5 in    -0.4 in    the amplitude evolution of @xmath0sfr can be recast in terms of the timescale for star formation activity . models generally predict that galaxies have @xmath62sfr@xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the hubble time , perhaps reduced by 1  gyr because few stars were forming at @xmath65 , as seen e.g. in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : sfrmstar ] .",
    "a convenient parameterization is provided by the _ star formation activity parameter _ defined here as the dimensionless quantity @xmath66sfr@xmath67 .",
    "physically , this may be regarded as the fraction of the hubble time ( minus a gyr ) that a galaxy needs to have formed stars at its current rate in order to produce its current stellar mass .",
    "note that @xmath6 is in general a function of @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tact ] shows @xmath68 for simulations and observations , top panel showing values at @xmath69 , bottom showing @xmath70 .",
    "the values for models have been obtained by fitting power laws to simulated galaxies @xmath0sfr .",
    "the momentum - driven outflow hydro simulation results are shown as the red circles , while cyan and magenta circles show results for no winds and the wind model of @xcite at @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the outflow model has only a mild effect on @xmath6 , because the _ form _ of the sfhs are broadly similar regardless of outflows , even though the total amount of stars formed is significantly different  @xcite .",
    "the most dramatic outlier among models is the high - mass bin of the no - wind simulation , where the rapid gas consumption in large galaxies results in lower current star formation rates relative to the past - averaged one ( i.e. natural downsizing ) ; this actually makes @xmath6 larger and the discrepancy with observations worse .",
    "millenium sam results are quite similar to the hydro runs , again showing little evolution in @xmath6 , although the shallower slope results in a somewhat smaller @xmath6 for the lower mass bin .",
    "overall , it is remarkable that regardless of methodology or feedback processes , all models predict @xmath6 to be around unity with little evolution from @xmath72 , regardless of stellar mass .",
    "this suggests that @xmath4 is a generic consequence of smooth and steady cold accretion dominating the growth of these galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the observed @xmath0sfr relation yields a rapidly rising @xmath73 from @xmath74 at @xmath75",
    ". values at @xmath76 are slightly lower but show similar rapid evolution .",
    "the dramatic difference between observed and predicted amplitude evolution either indicates a significant misunderstanding in our basic picture of galaxy assembly , or else that observations have been misinterpreted in some way . given the currently uncertain state of galaxy formation theory",
    ", one might be inclined towards the former , and call into question the entire picture of cold mode - dominated accretion .",
    "however , it turns out that the rapidly declining @xmath6 also results in uncomfortable conflicts with other _ observations _ of high - redshift galaxies . to see this ,",
    "let us discard the idea of cold mode accretion , or any preconceived theoretical notion , and ask : what possible star formation histories for these galaxies could yield @xmath6 rising with time as observed ?",
    "one scenario is to postulate that observed high-@xmath9 galaxies are progressively more dominated by bursts of star formation .",
    "indeed , some models have suggested that bursts may comprise a significant portion of the high-@xmath9 galaxy population  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , as @xcite points out , this seems unlikely given the tightness of the @xmath2-sfr relation .",
    "they argue that the observed scatter of 0.3  dex at @xmath77 implies that most star forming galaxies have current star formation rates @xmath78 of their quiescent value , and that the mean of the relation represents the quiescent  main sequence \" of galaxy assembly .",
    "few galaxies between this main sequence and the passive population are seen , arguing for rapid movement between the two populations . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the constraints are even more severe , as @xcite measure a @xmath79 scatter of 0.29  dex ( 0.16  dex interquartile ) , while the observed @xmath80 implies they are bursting at @xmath81 their quiescent rate . since these observations are able to probe sfrs down to @xmath82/yr , moderate stellar mass ( @xmath83 ) galaxies with @xmath84 would have been seen if present , but are not .",
    "the only way the burst scenario would work is if all observed galaxies somehow conspire to be bursting at approximately the same level , which seems highly contrived .",
    "hence bursts do not seem to be a viable way to produce low @xmath6 .",
    "another possible scenario is that models simply need to begin forming stars at a later epoch .",
    "this would effectively lower @xmath6 as defined here , while still maintaining a fairly constant sfr as required by the observed scatter .",
    "theoretically , such a scenario is easier said than done , as the epoch where galaxy formation begins is not a free parameter even in semi - analytic models , but rather is governed by halo formation times that are well - constrained by current cosmological parameters .",
    "such a scenario would require overwhelmingly strong feedback at early epochs , far stronger than even the strong feedback present in e.g. hydro simulations that match observed @xmath85 galaxy star formation rates  @xcite , in order for copious dense gas to be present in early halos yet not form stars .",
    "still , in the spirit of discarding any theoretical preconceptions ,  delayed galaxy formation \" appears to be a viable solution .",
    "however , quantitative consideration of delayed galaxy formation leads to significant problems when confronted by other observations . at @xmath38",
    ", @xmath80 implies that ( constant ) star formation began roughly 0.5  gyr prior  which corresponds to @xmath86 ! of course it can not be true that _ all _ galaxies began forming stars at @xmath87 , as many star - forming galaxies are seen at significantly higher redshifts  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , both the cosmic star formation rate ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) , and the rest - uv luminosity function  @xcite are observed to be fairly constant between @xmath88 .",
    "so it appears galaxies were forming stars quite vigorously at @xmath89 .",
    "even if galaxies smoothly ramped up their star formation to values observed at @xmath8 , they would still need to start at @xmath90 .",
    "if most galaxies can not have such a low @xmath6 , perhaps the observed systems represent only a small subset of galaxies at @xmath8 , and the rest are simply unseen .",
    "since current surveys identify both uv - luminous and red , dusty star forming galaxies , it must be that the unseen galaxies are passive , or else so extremely extincted that they only show up in e.g. sub - millimeter surveys .",
    "for the latter case , @xcite found that the cosmic sfr has a relatively minor contribution from such severely extincted systems that escape bzk / lbg selection at @xmath8 , so they are not likely to be the dominant growth mode for galaxies .",
    "moreover , this actually exacerbates the @xmath0sfr problem , because it provides a mode to form many more stars beyond what is formed quiescently , which would make the expected stellar masses even higher than just from the quiescent mode .",
    "hence the unseen galaxies must be passive , or forming stars at some undetectably low rate . in the currently popular downsizing scenario",
    "@xcite , these systems would have formed their stars earlier in a rapid mode , and have now attenuated their star formation through some feedback process so as not to be selected in star - forming samples . perhaps by @xmath8 , downsizing is already well underway , and the observed galaxies only represent the small fraction of systems that have just recently begun forming stars and will soon be quenched .",
    "while qualitatively sensible , the  unseen passive galaxies \" model is once again quantitatively inconsistent with other observations of high-@xmath9 galaxies .",
    "@xcite used a _",
    "spitzer_/irac - selected sample to determine that the star - forming bzk ( sbzk ) selection technique , i.e. the one employed by @xcite to measure @xmath2-sfr at @xmath8 , encompasses 88% of their galaxies ( 2691/3044 ) from @xmath91 .",
    "this is remarkably efficient , significantly more so than e.g. the lyman break or distant red galaxy selection techniques in obtaining a stellar mass - limited sample .",
    "their stellar mass completeness is estimated to be @xmath92% above @xmath93 for passively evolving galaxies . putting these together",
    ", this means that conservatively at least two - thirds of all galaxies above this mass threshold are selected as sbzk galaxies , and hence less than one - third are unseen passive galaxies . in contrast , the observed @xmath0sfr relation at @xmath8 implies @xmath94 , meaning that @xmath95 of galaxies should be unseen ( passive ) , or else the duty cycle of such objects should be @xmath96 .",
    "this assumes galaxies began significant activity @xmath97  gyr after the big bang , and that @xmath98 at @xmath99 ; the latter is again conservative , as an extrapolation would indicate that @xmath6 should be even lower at @xmath99 .",
    "hence it does not appear that sbzk selection misses nearly enough systems to make the unseen passive galaxies scenario viable to explain @xmath100 .",
    "another way to accomodate the low scatter , unity slope , and rapid evolution in @xmath0sfr is to propose that galaxies evolve _ along _ the @xmath0sfr relation , as proposed by @xcite . at @xmath8",
    ", @xmath98 implies that galaxies must be growing very quickly .",
    "rapid growth means that for any given galaxy , the amplitude of @xmath0sfr is essentially unchanging . now since sfr@xmath101 , an unchanging amplitude implies a solution of @xmath102 in other words , in this scenario , galaxies have exponentially growing star formation rates and stellar masses",
    "! this growth would presumably continue until star formation is truncated by some feedback mechanism , probably when @xmath103 . while at first this  exponentially growing galaxies \" idea may seem incredible , of all the scenarios",

    "one way to test this scenario is to consider the evolution of the number densities @xmath104 of galaxies .",
    "the @xmath105-folding time of stellar mass growth is given by @xmath106sfr . assuming ( conservatively )",
    "that @xmath98 remains constant at @xmath107 , then @xmath108  gyr changes with time means that the assumption of a constant @xmath2-sfr amplitude in equation  [ eqn : tau ] is invalid ; however , a simple evolutionary model accounting for this yields virtually identical results . ] .",
    "a simple calculation shows that there are e.g. five @xmath105-folding times ( or 2.2 decades of growth ) from @xmath109 . for a given stellar mass @xmath2 , @xmath110 at @xmath38",
    "should then be similar to @xmath111 at @xmath112 ( neglecting mergers ) .",
    "@xcite measured the number density of galaxies with @xmath113 at @xmath8 to be @xmath114mpc@xmath115 , and those with @xmath116 at @xmath112 have @xmath117mpc@xmath115 ( based on an extrapolation of their sty fits ) , and stellar mass functions from @xcite yield similar values .",
    "hence at face value current data suggests that the stellar mass function does not evolve quite as rapidly as expected in this scenario .",
    "still there are substantial uncertainties in the observed stellar mass function at such low masses and high redshifts , so a factor of a few discrepancy is not compelling enough to rule out the exponentially growing galaxies scenario .",
    "another scenario that has been shown to reproduce @xmath2-sfr evolution is the staged galaxy formation model of @xcite . here",
    ", a delay is introduced in the onset of galaxy formation that is inversely related to the galaxy mass . hence large - mass objects form early and quickly , while small ones start forming later over longer timescales .",
    "this is similar to the exponentially - growing galaxies scenario in the sense that the latter implicitly assumes a sort of delay , because galaxies must accumulate lots of gas in their halo without forming stars in order to have a sufficient gas reservoir to then consume exponentially .",
    "hence it may be possible to constrain staged galaxy formation with similar measurements of the stellar mass function to higher-@xmath9 ; this is being investigated by k. noeske ( priv .",
    "if either exponentially - growing or staged galaxy formation is correct , this would indicate that star formation at early epochs does not scale with gas density as seen locally  @xcite , or else that cold gas is somehow prevented from accumulating in halos as expected from growth of structure .    in summary , the small @xmath6 at @xmath8 implied by the @xmath0sfr amplitude",
    "is difficult to reconcile with the observed scatter in @xmath0sfr , the observed evolution of star - forming galaxies to higher redshifts , and the observed fraction of passive galaxies . taken together",
    ", the latter data all point to the idea that observed star - forming galaxies represent the majority of galaxies at intermediate masses ( @xmath118 ) at @xmath8 , and have been quiescently forming stars over much of a hubble time , i.e. @xmath4 . while designer models of stellar assembly can not be excluded , they would be highly unexpected , and would require substantial revision to our understanding of how gas accumulates and forms stars in hierarchical structure formation . the general difficulty in reconciling the data together with the models preference for @xmath4 suggests an uncomfortable situation that bears investigation into alternative solutions .",
    "determining @xmath2 and sfr from broad - band observations is fraught with a notoriously large number of systematic uncertainties that could alter the values of @xmath6 inferred from observations .",
    "here it is considered whether such systematics could be responsible for the low value of @xmath6 at high-@xmath9 , particularly focusing on the @xcite analysis at @xmath8 since that is where the discrepancies from model expectations and the range of possible systematics are greatest .",
    "star formation rates there are generally estimated by summing rest - uv flux ( uncorrected for extinction ) with 24@xmath119 flux . for objects that are anomalously high or low in 24@xmath119 to dust - corrected uv sfr estimations",
    ", they use the dust - corrected uv or 24@xmath119 estimate , respectively ; however , only one - third of their sample are anomalous in that sense . meanwhile , stellar masses are estimated from sed fitting : using multi - band photometry or spectra , one fits model stellar population templates  ( in their case , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , varying parameters until the best fit is obtained . in detail , @xcite used a calibration of bzk color to stellar mass based on fitting k20 survey spectra  @xcite .",
    "the key assumptions in sed fitting are population synthesis models , dust extinction models , and the form of the star formation history , all of which introduce systematic uncertainties .",

    "this is found to lower the stellar mass estimates for high-@xmath9 galaxies by a factor of two or more  @xcite .",
    "however , the sense would be to _ exacerbate _ the problem by lowering @xmath2 and hence further reducing @xmath6 , compared with the @xcite models utilized in @xcite . hence while uncertainties in population synthesis models are not negligible , they seem unlikely to make a @xmath121 difference in the proper direction .",
    "it is possible to hide more stellar mass in objects if one postulates a very old underlying stellar population , in other words by modifying the assumed sfh form .",
    "@xcite found that for uv - selected galaxies , a mass increase of @xmath122 was possible without violating rest - optical constraints .",
    "however , @xmath120-selected samples like that of @xcite are generally redder with more contribution from old stellar light , so the amount that one can hide is more limited ( c. papovich , priv . comm . ) .",
    "more problematic is the fact that doing so requires assuming that the bulk of the galaxy s stars formed very early in the universe , and hence the current sfr is much lower than at that early epoch .",
    "it turns out that this is not a self - consistent solution for reducing @xmath6 .",
    "this is because if such a sfh history were true , one would expect that the current @xmath2 would be significantly _ more _ than obtained by assuming a constant sfh over a hubble time .",
    "this would imply @xmath123 for those galaxies . hence even hiding @xmath124",
    "as much stellar mass as currently inferred would be insufficient , because it would only make @xmath4 , whereas such a sfh implies @xmath123 . in order for there to be a large old stellar population while still having a high current sfr",
    ", it must be that such galaxies formed many stars early , then sat around not forming stars until a recent flare - up ; however , this scenario suffers the same difficulties as the delayed galaxy formation model .",
    "hence one can not self - consistently alter the sfhs to hide a large amount of very old stars in these galaxies .    instead",
    ", it may be possible to appeal to some systematic reduction in the inferred star formation rate .",
    "why might the true sfr be lower than estimated ?",
    "one possibility is that the extinction corrections being used for uv - estimated sfrs are too excessive .",
    "now recall that for the majority of galaxies , @xcite estimated the sfr from the uncorrected uv plus 24@xmath119 flux , so for those cases the extinction correction is not relevant ; it is only relevant for the @xmath125 that are  mid - ir excess \" systems . for those , there may be room to alter the extinction law such that the extinction inferred from the uv spectral slope is overestimated .",
    "@xcite , like most studies of actively star forming galaxies , use the @xcite law . using instead a milky way or lmc law would indeed yield less extinction for a given uv spectral slope , but the typical reduction is less than a factor of two .",
    "so it seems unlikely that extinction alone is causing the low @xmath6 even in the minority mid - ir excess objects , unless the extinction law were dramatically different than anything seen in the local universe .",
    "another possibility is that there is an additional contribution to the rest - uv flux besides star formation .",
    "the obvious candidate are agn , which are common in @xmath8 star forming galaxies . while @xcite found that only @xmath126 of @xmath127 galaxies at @xmath18 have x - ray detectable agn , @xcite identified obscured agn through their mid - ir excess , and found that they appear in @xmath128 of galaxies at @xmath129 , and dominate the overall agn population at @xmath8 .",
    "importantly , they also found ( in agreement with previous studies , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that smaller mass galaxies have a lower agn fraction , as expected theoretically  @xcite .",
    "recall that @xcite used uv fluxes to estimate sfr in such mid - ir excess objects , and by comparison with x - ray data they estimated that such an inferred sfr is unlikely to be wrong by a significant factor .",
    "moreover , since agn are increasingly rare in smaller mass systems , it would be an odd coincidence if they mimicked the relation @xmath17sfr@xmath130 so tightly . like the burst model , this represents a fine - tuning problem , where agn have to contribute a very specific amount to the inferred sfr at each mass scale for no obvious physical reason .",
    "this can not be ruled out , but seems a priori unlikely .",
    "it is also possible that agn could be present in galaxies that are not mid - ir excess systems .",
    "the strong dichotomy in the x - ray properties suggest there is not a continuum of agn , and that agns are limited to mid - ir excess systems  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there exist agn templates where the contibution to rest - uv and rest-8@xmath119 flux are broadly comparable to that in star - forming galaxies  @xcite . these could be mistaken for  normal \" star - forming systems , whereas in fact the dominant flux is from agn .",
    "still , once again , to mimic the tight @xmath0sfr relation would require agn to be contaminating the sfr estimate at a similar level at all stellar masses .",
    "moreover , if they are dominating the uv flux then they should appear as central point sources , but _",
    "hubble_/acs imaging of sbzk galaxies generally do not show such bright central sources ( m. dickinson , priv .",
    "comm . ) . hence while agn are certainly present , it seems unlikely that they are a major contaminant for uv - derived sfrs .",
    "a perhaps even more troublesome issue is the use of rest-8@xmath119 ( i.e. 24@xmath119 at @xmath8 ) as a star formation rate indicator .",
    "this is quite uncertain , because the dominant flux at those wavelengths is from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features , whose nature is not well understood . as @xcite points out",
    ", there is more than a factor of two scatter in star formation rate indicators that assume a fixed ( local ) pah template .",
    "moreover , owing to pah features moving in and out of bands , standard photometric redshift uncertainties of @xmath131 can result in up to an order of magnitude error in inferred sfrs . on the other hand ,",
    "the tight scatter in the @xmath8 @xmath0sfr relation would seem to limit the amount of scatter owing to pah feature variations , or else be an indication that uv light dominates over pah emission  ( though the latter is not what is seen locally ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite notes that @xmath132 emission has a substantial metallicity dependence , but it is in the sense that lower metallicities have lower emission , so their sfr would be underestimated by using solar metallicity calibrations .",
    "so while it is conceivable that some unknown reason causes pah emission per unit star formation to be systematically higher in high-@xmath9 galaxies compared to local ones , thereby causing the sfr to be overestimated , but there are no obvious indications that this would mimic a tight @xmath2-sfr relation .    finally , the observed sfr and @xmath2 s in @xcite are inferred assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "assuming instead a @xcite or @xcite imf would result in shifting _ both _ @xmath2 and sfr down by @xmath133  dex  @xcite .",
    "hence to first order it makes no difference as long as the @xmath0sfr slope is around unity ( e. daddi , priv .",
    "fundamentally , this is because at high-@xmath9 both stellar mass and star formation rate indicators are driven by light from stars @xmath134 , and favored present - day galactic imfs generally agree on the shape above this mass . hence more substantial imf variations would be required .    in summary ,",
    "there are no obvious paths to systematically alter @xmath2 and sfr determination to make up up the required @xmath135 difference in @xmath6 at @xmath8 .",
    "it is true that many of these systematics can not be ruled out entirely , and it may be possible that a combination of such effects could explain part or even all of the difference .",
    "it is also possible that locally calibrated relations to estimate @xmath2 and sfr may be substantially different at high-@xmath9 for unknown and unanticipated reasons .",
    "the reader is left to assess the plausibility of such scenarios .",
    "the view taken here is that the difficulty in obtaining a straightforward solution motivates the consideration of more exotic possibilities .",
    "one possible way to alter @xmath2-sfr evolution is to invoke an imf that is in some direct or indirect way redshift - dependent .",
    "the key point is that most direct measures of the star formation rate actually trace high - mass star formation , while stellar mass is dominated by lower - mass stars .",
    "hence by modifying the ratio of high to low mass stars formed , i.e. the shape of the imf , it is possible to alter the @xmath0sfr relation .",
    "the possibility of a varying imf has been broached many times in various contexts  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though typically as a last resort scenario .",
    "it is highly speculative as there is no clear - cut evidence at present that supports a time- or space - varying imf , but it is worth investigating in light of growing observational and theoretical arguments in its favor .",
    "as @xcite points out , a universal imf is not to be expected theoretically , though no variations have been unequivocally detected in local studies of star - forming regions .",
    "the average galactic imf appears to be well - represented by several power laws , steepest at @xmath136 , then significantly shallower at @xmath137 , with a turnover at @xmath138  ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "forms that follow this include the currently - favored @xcite and @xcite imfs .",
    "but deviations _ are _ seen , at least at face value .",
    "the nearby starburst galaxy m82 appears to have an imf deficient in low - mass stars  @xcite .",
    "a similarly bottom - light imf is inferred in the highly active arches cluster near the galactic center , suggesting that vigorous star formation makes the imf top - heavy  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also , the young lmc cluster r136 shows a flattening in the imf below @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "there are hints that presently active star clusters form more low - mass stars compared to the disk - averaged 5 gyr - old imf  @xcite , suggesting that the imf was weighted towards heavier stars at lower metallicities and/or earlier times .",
    "even if the imf shape is universal , larger starforming regions may produce more high - mass stars simply because they have enough material to aggregate into larger stars  @xcite .",
    "hence there are hints of imf variations , albeit controversial , and interestingly they consistently go in the direction of having a higher ratio of massive to low - mass stars in conditions similar to those in high-@xmath9 galaxies . compared to present - day star - forming systems , galaxies at high-@xmath9 have far higher star formation surface densities than the galactic disk  @xcite , have higher gas content and hence presumably more massive starforming clouds  @xcite , and have somewhat lower metallicities  @xcite . @xcite and @xcite list other pieces of circumstantial evidence that favor early top - heavy imfs .",
    "so while there are no direct observational evidences or strong theoretical arguments for it , it is not inconceivable that the imf in high-@xmath9 galaxies may be more top - heavy or bottom - light than the present - day galactic imf .",
    "such an imf would have three main effects on the @xmath0sfr relation : it would increase the output of uv flux per unit stellar mass formed ; it would cause more stellar mass loss from stellar evolution ; and the mass recycling would provide a larger gas reservoir with which to form stars .",
    "all three effects go towards reconciling theoretical expectations with observations of the @xmath2-sfr relation .",
    "the sfr inferred by assuming a standard imf would be an overestimate , since many fewer low - mass stars are formed per high - mass star . increased recycling losses would lower the theoretical expectations for the amount of stellar mass remaining in these galaxies , bringing them more into line with observed stellar masses .",
    "recycled gas would increase the available reservoir for new stars , effectively delaying star formation in galaxies and pushing models towards the  delayed galaxy formation \" scenario .",
    "hence even modest evolution in the imf could in principle reconcile the observed and theoretically - expected @xmath6 evolution .",
    "how is the imf expected to evolve with time ? this is difficult to predict since no ab initio theory for the imf exists today . but a simple conjecture by @xcite may have some empirical value .",
    "he notes that there is a mass scale of @xmath140 below which the galactic imf becomes flatter  @xcite , and at which point the mass contribution per logarithmic bin ( @xmath141 ) is maximized .",
    "larson uses simple thermal physics arguments to show that this _ characteristic imf mass scale _ ( @xmath142 ) is related to the minimum temperature @xmath143 of molecular clouds , measured today to be around 8  k. in that case , if the temperature in the interstellar media ( ism ) of high-@xmath9 galaxies is higher , this characteristic mass will shift upwards , resulting in an imf that is more bottom - light .    to generate a crude imf evolution model ,",
    "let us assume that the @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is some unknown parameter whose value is set by the various effects above .",
    "@xcite predicted analytically that @xmath146 , while recent numerical experiments by @xcite found a less steep scaling of @xmath147 .",
    "so for example an evolution that scaled purely with cmb temperature would yield @xmath148 .",
    "however , other factors may cause an increased ism temperature , e.g. , elevated disk sfr rates causing more supernova heat input ; lower cooling rates owing to lower metallicities ; and/or photoionization from a stronger metagalactic uv flux  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the approach adopted here is to treat @xmath145 as a free parameter , to be constrained using the observed evolution of @xmath6 .",
    "the assumption is that @xmath149 reflects the present - day galactic imf , while @xmath150 is inferred to be lower purely because of the assumption of a non - evolving imf , whereas in reality @xmath68 ( at any given mass ) is constant as expected in models .",
    "an  evolving kroupa \" imf is defined in which @xmath151 above @xmath142 , the imf has a form @xmath152 , while below it scales as @xmath153 .",
    "note that the current galactic imfs also have a turn - down at masses below @xmath154 ; the present analysis provides no constraints in this regime , as the stellar mass formed there is a small fraction of the total .",
    "the exact form of the imf is not critical here ; @xcite is chosen for its convenient explicit parameterization in terms of @xmath142 , but the analysis below could equally well have been done with the similar chabrier imf .    the goal of the evolving imf is to increase the ratio of the star formation rate of _ high - mass _ stars ( sfr@xmath155 ) to total stellar mass formed , such that the inferred @xmath68 is non - evolving .",
    "note that different probes such as uv luminosity , h@xmath156 emission , and mid - ir emission trace slightly different regimes of high - mass star formation , but so long as the high - mass imf slope remains fixed , the relative ratios of such emission should be constant .",
    "so for example , in order to produce no evolution in @xmath6 from @xmath157 at @xmath76 , the factors by which @xmath158sfr@xmath159 must be raised are 1.9 at @xmath47 and 3.3 at @xmath38 , relative to a standard kroupa imf ( cf .",

    "the result is shown as the dotted cyan line in figure  [ fig : mchar ] .",
    "it is similar to the paunchy imf of @xcite , showing elevated formation rates of intermediate mass stars , though it is slightly more top - heavy .",
    "this comparison is preliminary because the ebl and current @xmath120-band light trace stellar output differently than the cosmic star formation history .",
    "still , it is likely that this evolving imf will go significantly towards reconciling the various observations considered in @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently argued for a more top - heavy imf at early times from the evolution of colors and mass - to - light ratios of early - type galaxies in clusters from @xmath217 . parameterizing the evolution in terms of the characteristic mass of a chabrier imf",
    ", he favored a characteristic mass that evolves by @xmath218 from @xmath219 until today ; this is consistent with @xmath220 as proposed here .",
    "note that his analysis only applies to stars formed in early - type cluster galaxies , so is not necessarily applicable to all galaxies . making the assumption that it is widely applicable , @xcite determined a cosmic stellar mass growth rate that is broadly consistent with the evolving imf case shown in figure  [ fig : madau ] ( though in detail it is more peaked towards lower @xmath9 ;",
    "see his fig .",
    "13 ) . while many uncertainties are present in the his analysis , it is reassuring that similar imf evolution is inferred from a completely independent line of argument .",
    "the ultimate test of an evolving imf is to directly measure the stellar mass buildup in the universe .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite did just that using deep _",
    "spitzer_/irac observations that probe near - ir light all the way out to @xmath203 .",
    "their data of cosmic stellar mass mass growth rates as a function of redshift are shown as the magenta and red data points in figure  [ fig : madau ] , respectively ( assuming a salpeter imf ) .",
    "these data points were obtained by differentiating the stellar mass densities as a function of redshift published in those papers .",
    "although those two samples are independent , both show that the stellar mass growth rate is significantly different than that inferred from the observed cosmic star formation history , particularly at @xmath221 .",
    "@xcite notes that this may favor an imf weighted more towards massive stars at high redshifts .",
    "they mention that utilizing a chabrier or kroupa imf will lessen the discrepancy , but such a reduction is essentially by a fixed factor at all redshifts ( modulo minor stellar evolution differences ) , so even if the normalization is adjusted to agree with the cosmic sfh at @xmath13 , it would still yield significantly lower sfrs at @xmath221 .",
    "a major uncertainty in this comparison is that @xcite , in order to integrate up the total stellar mass , assumed a @xcite faint - end slope that is fixed at @xmath222 , even though they can not directly constrain @xmath156 at @xmath221 .",
    "they justify this assumption by noting that there is no evidence for a change in @xmath156 from @xmath223 .",
    "but if @xmath156 becomes progressively steeper with redshift , as suggested by @xcite , it could also reconcile these observations .",
    "note that it would have to steepen quickly , e.g. to @xmath224 at @xmath211 to reconcile the @xmath7 difference , significantly faster than @xmath225 observed by @xcite out to @xmath226 .",
    "@xcite also found that @xmath156 does increase with redshifts slightly in one form of their analysis , though again not by enough to explain the discrepancy .",
    "still , the difficulty of constraining the faint - end slope at high-@xmath9 , along with inherent uncertainties in sed fitting , mean that these observations can not be considered definitive proof of a varying imf .",
    "but at least at face value the agreement with the evolving imf case is quite good .",
    "@xcite independently determined the cosmic stellar mass growth rate by compiling observations of stellar mass densities from the literature for @xmath227  ( note that they do not include the perez - gonzalez et al . or elsner et al .",
    "carefully accounting for various different systematics , they fit a @xcite form to the implied cosmic star formation history ( including effects of stellar mass loss ) , and determine @xmath228^{2.2}$ ] , in @xmath160yr@xmath161mpc@xmath115 .",
    "this relation is shown as the cyan dashed line in figure  [ fig : madau ] ; it has been adjusted by @xmath229  dex to change from the imf they assumed ( similar to chabrier ) to a salpeter imf .",
    "it agrees well with other observations , and lies significantly below the star formation rate inferred from high - mass sfr indicators at high-@xmath9 .",
    "wilkins et al . suggest that an evolving imf may be the cause , and propose their own form of imf evolution to explain it .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : madau ] , the agreement with the evolving imf proposed here is quite good .    in short , an evolving kroupa imf does not obviously introduce any large inconsistencies with high-@xmath9 galaxy data , and moreover may be preferred based on low - redshift fossil light considerations and observed cosmic stellar mass growth rates . hence the amplitude evolution of the @xmath0sfr relation may be yet another example of an observation of stellar mass buildup that suggests that the imf is weighted towards more massive stars at higher redshifts .",
    "implications of the observed stellar mass  star formation rate correlation are investigated in the context of current theories for stellar mass assembly .",
    "the key point , found here and pointed out in previous studies  @xcite , is that the amplitude of the @xmath0sfr relation evolves much more rapidly since @xmath8 in observations that in current galaxy formation models .",
    "it is shown here that this is true of both hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models , and is broadly independent of feedback parameters .",
    "in contrast , the slope and scatter of the observed @xmath0sfr relation are in good agreement with models .",
    "the tight @xmath0sfr relation with a slope near unity predicted in models is a generic result owing to the dominance of cold mode accretion , particularly in early galaxies , which produces rapid , smooth and relatively steady infall .",
    "the slow amplitude evolution arises because star formation starts at @xmath65 for moderately massive star - forming galaxies and continues at a fairly constant or mildly declining level to low-@xmath9 . the large discrepancy in amplitude evolution when compared to observations from @xmath206 hints at some underlying problem either with the models or with the interpretation of data . a convenient parameterization of the problem is through the star formation activity parameter , @xmath230 , where @xmath64 is the hubble time",
    ". a low value corresponds to a starbursting system , a high value to a passive system , and a value near unity to system forming stars constantly for nearly a hubble time . in models , @xmath6 remains constant around unity from @xmath231 , whereas in observations it rises steadily from @xmath232 at @xmath8 to close to unity at @xmath23 .",
    "several ad hoc modifications to the theoretical picture of stellar mass assembly are considered in order to match @xmath6 evolution , but each one is found to be in conflict with other observations of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "bursts seem unlikely given the low scatter in @xmath0sfr .",
    "delaying galaxy formation to match @xmath6 results in such a low redshift for the onset of star formation , it is in conflict with observations of star forming galaxies at earlier epochs . hiding a large population of galaxies as passive runs into difficulty when compared to direct observations of the passive galaxy fraction in mass - selected samples at @xmath8 .",
    "having an exponentially growing phase of star formation or  staged \" galaxy formation are perhaps the most plausible solutions from an observational viewpoint , but it is difficult to understand theoretically how such scenarios can arise within hierarchical structure formation .",
    "hence if observed star - forming galaxies are quiescently forming stars and represent the majority of galaxies at @xmath8 , as other observations seem to suggest , then it is not easy to accomodate the low @xmath6 inferred from the @xmath0sfr amplitude",
    ".    systematic uncertainties in @xmath2 or sfr determinations could bias results progressively more at high-@xmath9 in order to mimic evolution in @xmath6 .",
    "various currently debated sources are considered , such as the contribution to near - ir light from tp - agb stars , extinction corrections , assumptions about star formation history , agn contamination , and pah emission calibration .",
    "it may be possible to concoct scenarios whereby several of these effects combine to mimic @xmath6 evolution , but there are no suggestions from local observations that such scenarios are to be expected",
    ". hence if systematic effects are to explain the low @xmath6 at high-@xmath9 , it would imply significant and unexpected changes in tracers of star formation and stellar mass between now and high redshifts .",
    "a solution is proposed that the stellar initial mass function becomes increasingly bottom - light to higher redshifts .",
    "several lines of arguments are presented that vaguely or circumstantially favor such evolution , though no smoking gun signatures are currently known .",
    "a simple model of imf evolution is constructed , based on the ansatz by @xcite that the minimum temperature of molecular clouds is reflected in the characteristic mass of star formation ( @xmath142 ) where the mass contribution per logarithmic mass bin is maximized .",
    "the minimum temperature may increase with redshift owing to a hotter cosmic microwave background , more vigorous star formation activity , or lower metallicities within early galactic isms . in order to reconcile the observed @xmath6 evolution with theoretical expectations of no evolution ,",
    "an evolving imf of the form @xmath233 is proposed .",
    "the exponent of @xmath142 evolution is constrained by requiring no @xmath6 evolution , through careful modeling with the pegase.2 population synthesis code . while the exact form of imf evolution is not well constrained by present observations ,",
    "what is required is that the imf has progressively more high - mass stars compared to low - mass at earlier epochs , and that this imf applies to the majority of star forming galaxies at any epoch .",
    "it is worth noting that this evolving imf is only constrained out to @xmath8 from the @xmath0sfr relation , though it yields predictions that are consistent with other observations out to @xmath226 .",
    "extrapolating such evolution to higher redshifts is dangerous , since no observational constraints exist and the precise cause of imf evolution is not understood .",
    "implications of such an evolving imf are investigated . by leaving the high - mass end of the imf unchanged , recent successes in understanding the connections between high - mass star formation , feedback , and metal enrichment",
    "are broadly preserved .",
    "the cosmic stellar mass accumulation rate would be altered compared to what is inferred from cosmic star formation history measurements using a standard imf .",
    "it is shown that an evolving imf is at face value in better agreement with direct measures of cosmic stellar mass assembly  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the evolving imf goes towards relieving the generic tension between present - day fossil light measures versus observations of the cosmic star formation history .",
    "in particular , the paunchy imf favored by @xcite in order to reconcile the observed cosmic star formation history , present - day @xmath120-band luminosity density , and extragalactic background light constraints , is qualitatively similar to the cumulative imf of all stars formed by today in the evolving imf case .",
    "individually , each argument has sufficient uncertainties to cast doubt on whether a radical solution such as an evolving imf is necessary . but",
    "taken together , the @xmath0sfr relation adds to a growing body of circumstantial evidence that the ratio of high - mass to low - mass stars formed is higher at earlier epochs .",
    "it is by no means clear that imf variations are the only viable solution to the @xmath0sfr dilemma .",
    "the claim here is only that an evolving imf is an equally ( un)likely solution as invoking unknown systematic effects or carefully crafted star formation histories in order to explain @xmath0sfr evolution .",
    "it is hoped that this work will spur further efforts , both observational and theoretical , to investigate this important issue .",
    "future plans include performing a more careful analysis of the evolving imf in terms of observable quantities , in order to accurately quantify the impact of such imf evolution on the interpretation of uv , near - ir , and mid - ir light .",
    "also , it is feasible to incorporate such an evolving imf directly into simulation runs to properly account for gas recycling in such a scenario . finally , including some feedback mechanism to truncate star formation in massive systems may impact the @xmath0sfr relation in some way , so this will be incorporated into the hydro simulations .",
    "observationally , pushing sfr and @xmath2 determinations to higher redshifts is key ; a continued drop in @xmath6 to @xmath211 would rapidly solidify the discrepancies with current models , and would also generate stronger conflicts with other observations of high-@xmath9 galaxies . assessing the agn contribution and extinction uncertainties from high-@xmath9 systems is critical for accurately quantifying the light from high - mass star formation , for instance through the use of more direct star formation indicators such as paschen-@xmath156 . pushing observations further into the mid - ir such as to 70@xmath119 ,",
    "past the pah bands at @xmath8 , would mitigate pah calibration uncertainties in sfr estimates . obtaining a large sample of spectra for typical high-@xmath9 star - forming systems ( like cb58 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would more accurately constrain the sed than broad - band data .",
    "all of these programs push current technological capabilities to their limits and perhaps beyond , but are being planned as facilities continue their rapid improvement .    in summary",
    ", owing to the robust form of star formation histories in current galaxy formation models , the @xmath2-sfr relation represents a key test of our understanding of stellar mass assembly .",
    "current models reproduce the observed slope and scatter remarkably well , but broadly fail this test in terms of amplitude evolution .",
    "whether this reflects some fundamental lack of physical insight , or else some missing ingredient such as an evolving imf , is an issue whose resolution will have a significant impact on our understanding of galaxy formation .",

    "<S> the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass  star formation rate relationship ( @xmath0sfr ) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of galaxies . for star - forming galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0sfr is observed to be fairly tight with a slope close to unity from @xmath1 , and it evolves downwards roughly independently of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of galaxy formation reproduce these trends , broadly independent of modeling details , owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the observed amplitude of the @xmath0sfr relation evolves markedly differently than in models , indicating either that stellar mass assembly is poorly understood or that observations have been misinterpreted . </S>",
    "<S> stated in terms of a star formation activity parameter @xmath3 , models predict a constant @xmath4 out to redshifts @xmath5 , while the observed @xmath0sfr relation indicates that @xmath6 increases by @xmath7 from @xmath8 until today . the low @xmath6 ( i.e. rapid star formation ) at high-@xmath9 not only conflicts with models , but is also difficult to reconcile with other observations of high-@xmath9 galaxies , such as the small scatter in @xmath0sfr , the slow evolution of star forming galaxies at @xmath10 , and the modest passive fractions in mass - selected samples . </S>",
    "<S> systematic biases could significantly affect measurements of @xmath2 and sfr , but detailed considerations suggest that none are obvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> a speculative solution is considered in which the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) evolves towards more high - mass star formation at earlier epochs . following larson ( 1998 ) </S>",
    "<S> , a model is investigated in which the characteristic mass @xmath11 where the imf turns over increases with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> population synthesis models are used to show that the observed and predicted @xmath0sfr evolution may be brought into general agreement if @xmath12 out to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> such imf evolution matches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth , and the resulting @xmath13 cumulative imf is similar to the  paunchy \" imf favored by @xcite to reconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present - day fossil light measures .    </S>",
