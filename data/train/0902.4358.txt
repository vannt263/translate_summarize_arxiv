    "motivated by our earlier work on the scattering of topological solitons on potential obstructions in a class of models [ 1,2 ] we have decided to look at the generality of these results . to do this",
    "we have decided to investigate the scattering properties of non - topological solitons so in this paper we look at the scattering of q - balls on various potential obstructions .",
    "first we recall that q - balls are non - topological soliton fields , first introduced by s. coleman in [ 3 ] .",
    "they arise in some classes of self - interacting complex scalar fields . unlike topological solitons ,",
    "whose stability is ensured by the presence of a conserved topological charge , q - balls carry a conserved noether charge associated with the global @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "this conserved but non - topological charge stabilises the q - balls .",
    "also , q - balls have a time - dependent rotating phase and the conserved noether charge is related to the velocity of the change of this phase .",
    "these features result in a much more complicated scattering properties of these solitons , leading to such phenomena as , for example , the charge fission during the scattering process .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the q - ball dynamics in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions , mainly when the q - balls are scattered on various obstructions in the form of potential barriers or holes .",
    "first we discuss the conditions of the stability of the q - balls .",
    "then we report the results of our numerical simulations which have revealed that q - balls behave like topological solitons only for the values of the parameters of the theory that guarantee this stability throughout the scattering . when this condition is satisfied the dynamics of the scattering on barriers and holes in @xmath7 dimensions is similar to what was seen for topological solitons [ 1,2 ] , _ ie _ very little radiation is given off during the scattering . the scattering on barriers results in transmission or reflection , _ ie _ very much like that of a small particles . in the scattering on holes , like for topological solitons",
    ", we can have transmissions , trappings and reflections . as discussed before [ 1 - 2 , 4 - 5 ] the trappings correspond to the case of solitons which , while in the hole , lose energy through radiation and the reflections correspond to the very coherent interaction of solitons with this radiation .",
    "we find similar properties of the scattering of q - balls except that this time they also generate further small q - balls .",
    "this scattering is discussed in detail in sections 3 and 4 .    in section 5",
    "we discuss the scattering of solitons in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we find that , again , the scattering often resembles the scattering of small particles but the properties of this scattering depend crucially on the parameters of the theory .",
    "however , there are also small differences which we discuss in detail .",
    "the paper ends with a short section presenting our conclusions .",
    "we consider a complex scalar field @xmath9 in @xmath8 spatial dimensions [ 6 ] whose lagrangian density is given by @xmath10 where the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 run from 0 to @xmath8 .",
    "the energy momentum tensor takes the form :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the space - time metric with signature @xmath15 .",
    "this lagrangian has been so chosen that it is invariant under the global @xmath6 transformation and the conserved noether current,@xmath16 , associated with this symmetry , is given by :    @xmath17    the corresponding conserved noether charge,@xmath18 is then    @xmath19    the total energy and momentum are given , respectively , by @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the spatial index which runs from 1 to @xmath8 .",
    "the stationary q - ball located at the origin is described by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the internal rotation frequency and @xmath25 is the real radial profile function which satisfies the equation of motion which follows from ( 1 ) , namely : @xmath26 where @xmath8 is the number of spatial dimensions .    for the consistency of the equations and in order that the q - ball has a finite energy , the profile function @xmath27 , has to satisfy the following boundary conditions @xmath28 and @xmath29    the corresponding field ( 7 ) is then called the stationary q - ball .    as the lagrangian ( 1 ) is lorentz invariant the field ( 7 ) can be boosted with any velocity up to the speed of light .",
    "note that the equation for @xmath27 , ( 8) , can be treated as a mechanical analogue describing a point particle moving in an effective potential with friction if @xmath30 is interpreted as the position of the particle and @xmath31 as the time coordinate [ 6 ] .",
    "the effective potential in which this particle moves is then @xmath32    the ` friction ' term @xmath33 becomes important for high @xmath8 or small @xmath31 .      first let us choose our potential @xmath34 .",
    "we want it to be such that it gives rise to an exact q - ball solution in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "this potential should have an absolute minimum when @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 would be the ground state of the theory .",
    "moreover , we require that the symmetry of the theory remains unbroken",
    ".    however , looking at ( 11 ) we note that there are further conditions on the parameters of the q - ball ( _ ie _ @xmath24 ) . to see this we observe that the q - ball field exists provided that @xmath37 corresponds to a local maximum of the effective potential _",
    "@xmath38_{f=0}<0 $ ] .",
    "this leads to an upper bound on the frequency @xmath39 .",
    "also , the local minimum of @xmath40 $ ] must be attained at some positive value of @xmath41 and this requirement puts a lower bound on @xmath24 _ ie _ @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43   < \\omega < \\,u^{\\prime\\prime}\\left(0\\right).\\ ] ]    thus the q - ball field exists for @xmath24 in this range , _ ie _ @xmath44 .",
    "of course , as ( 11 ) is quadratic in @xmath24 , we can also take negative values of @xmath24 - the corresponding fields are called anti - q - balls .",
    "however , the existence of a q - ball does not guarantee its stability . for a q - ball field configuration to be stable",
    "we have to require that @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the mass of the scalar field .",
    "the potential we have chosen to use has the form [ 7 ] :    @xmath47    with this potential q - ball solutions exist for @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , these q - balls are stable as @xmath49 .",
    "next we insert our obstructions .",
    "following our earlier work [ 1 - 2 ] on the soliton scattering on obstructions we introduce a potential parameter that perturbs the q - ball only in a certain region of space . the q - ball ,",
    "as it moves towards this region , will only experience this perturbation when its profile function @xmath27 in non - zero in this region .",
    "we introduce the perturbation in the form of potential barriers and holes , and hence we modify the potential @xmath50 to become    @xmath51    in which @xmath52 .    thus @xmath53 is the extra potential parameter which has been inserted into the potential @xmath54 to take into account the effects of obstructions , holes and barriers , and so is non - zero only in a certain region of space .    in our case , we have put the obstruction around the origin ( _ ie _ @xmath55 ) and so we have taken    @xmath56    the q - ball in our model is really quite sizeable ( _ ie _ the solution of ( 8) for the potential ( 13 ) is nonzero for a sizeable region of @xmath57 ) so the obstruction has been made quite large to make sure that the q - ball size fits into it quite easily ; _ ie _ is significantly larger than the size of the q - ball .",
    "the equation of motion , in the presence of the obstruction , now takes the form @xmath58    using the q - ball ansatz , the field equation for the profile function , @xmath59 now takes the form : @xmath60    this profile equation ( 16 ) can only be solved exactly when @xmath61=constant . then with the help of [ 8 ] we note that @xmath27 is given by    @xmath62^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    as the theory is lorentz invariant this solution can be be boosted or shifted by a spatial translation .",
    "then , the q - ball solution becomes @xmath63^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the position of the q - ball , @xmath65 its velocity and @xmath66 is the usual relativistic factor .    however , @xmath67 constant and so this expression does not solve ( 16 ) for all values of the parameters . on the other hand our @xmath68 , ( 18 ) , is strongly localised and so if the q - ball is far away from the obstruction the solution to ( 16 ) is approximately given by ( 18 ) and so ( 18 ) can be used for the initial condition of our numerical simulation of ( 15 ) .    note",
    "that when the q - ball is far enough from the obstruction @xmath69 and ( 18 ) becomes    @xmath70^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    the associated q - ball noether charge and the energy become    @xmath71    @xmath72    where    @xmath73^\\frac{1}{2}$ ] and @xmath74 .",
    "moreover ,    @xmath75 ,    @xmath76 , + @xmath77    we see that both @xmath78 and @xmath79 depend on @xmath24 and so , in follows , we call them @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus the q - ball noether charge is    @xmath82^\\frac{1}{2}\\ ] ]    and the energy becomes    @xmath83.\\ ] ]    when @xmath84 ( _ ie _ the q - ball is at rest ) the energy becomes its mass and is given by    @xmath85    looking at these formulae we observe that as @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 and when @xmath89 then @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "1 shows that @xmath92 and @xmath80 are monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath24 increases the charge decreases and in the limit as @xmath93 the charge , @xmath94 . in this upper bound limit",
    "the energy - charge ratio approaches the mass of the scalar field , _ ie _ @xmath95 . in the lower bound limit , _ ie _ when @xmath96 , the ratio @xmath97 .",
    "2 shows clearly that the energy - charge ratio is below the mass term of the scalar field when the velocity of the q - ball is small [ 9 ] .",
    "when @xmath98 the energy - charge ratio is always below the stability line and only intersects this line when @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the q - balls are stable for small velocities and so are prevented from decaying into a number of smaller q - balls .",
    "however , when the q - ball acquires higher speeds the absolute stability condition can be violated ; q - balls can still be long - lived and will , eventually , decay into a number of smaller q - balls [ 7 ] .",
    "2 shows that as @xmath24 increases and so @xmath100 and @xmath87 decrease the stability condition becomes more violated for higher velocities .    when an obstruction is present in a certain region of space the mass term gets modified by the perturbation factor @xmath3 _ ie _ @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the stability line shown in fig .",
    "2 gets shifted and the amount of the shift depends on the magnitude of the perturbation . in the case of a barrier",
    "the stability line gets shifted upwards and downwards in the case of a hole .",
    "consequently , the q - ball is less stable in the presence of holes .",
    "this is what we have observed in our simulations .",
    "this scattering on holes is very delicate since if we want the q - ball to be stable against fission , as the q - ball reaches the hole , the hole must be relatively shallow .",
    "so , when the potential is lowered by a positive factor ( but less than one ) , _ ie _ @xmath102 , the tail of the q - ball may develop some small q - balls in the hole even when the q - ball has a vanishing velocity . on the other hand ,",
    "the q - ball stability is not affected by the height of the barrier in cases when the velocity is small .",
    "in fact , within some limits , the higher the barrier the more stable is the q - ball scattering as the stability line is shifted further upwards .",
    "however , we have to be careful ; the q - ball may also become unstable if the barrier is too high .     and the charge @xmath87 as a function of @xmath24",
    ". , width=377 ]    / @xmath78 as a function of @xmath24 for various velocities.,width=453 ]    in next two sections we discuss the dynamics of q - balls as they meet an obstruction located around @xmath103 . in order to understand it we had to perform some numerical simulations .",
    "these simulations were performed using the 4th order runge - kutta method of simulating the time evolution .",
    "we used 12001 points with the lattice spacing of @xmath104 .",
    "hence , the lattice extended from -60 to 60 in the @xmath57-direction .",
    "the time step was chosen to be @xmath105 . in our work",
    "we used the absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "when a q - ball , or a topological soliton , are far away from an obstruction , to a good approximation , they can be treated as a point particle following a well defined trajectory . however , when they approach the barrier the differences in their behaviour begin to arise .",
    "these differences stem from the fact that the q - charge of the q - ball is not quantized and that not only q - balls exist only in a certain range of frequencies but also there are some conditions on the q - ball that have to be satisfied for it to be stable .",
    "the work on topological solitons [ 1 - 4 ] has revealed that the speed and the magnitude of the barrier do not affect significantly the general dynamics of the solitons .",
    "topological solitons suffer some distortions during their scattering process but they do recover their original shape after the scattering as the scattering is quite elastic . for the q - balls , however , their dynamics on obstructions ( barriers or holes ) is connected to their stability .",
    "and this stability depends on the velocity , the height of the obstruction and the internal frequency of the q - balls and thus on their charge .",
    "one major difference between the q - balls and topological solitons as they scatter on barriers is their behaviour close to their critical velocities .",
    "critical velocities of the solitons are the lowest velocities above which they can overcome the barrier and get transmitted and below which they are reflected .",
    "all models involving topological solitons that we have studied have shown that the solitons can be treated as point particles and that such a discussion leads to very accurate estimates of their critical velocity .",
    "there are no restrictions on the speed of the solitons or the height of the barrier . in the case of the q - balls the situation is different .",
    "first of all , the critical velocity can not be determined without having to impose some restrictions on their speeds and the height of the barrier .",
    "this is due to the possibility of the q - ball becoming unstable during its interaction with the barrier .    as we have seen from fig .",
    "2 the stability condition is satisfied only for low velocities . when a barrier is present , the stability line is raised and more q - ball field configurations become stable .",
    "so to begin with we will consider the scattering on very small barriers .",
    "before we go on and discuss the scattering dynamics of the q - ball on such barriers , we have to determine whether the force between the q - ball and the barrier is repulsive or attractive .",
    "to check this we have placed a q - ball at rest close to the barrier .",
    "3 presents a trajectory of a q - ball with @xmath106 initially placed at rest at @xmath107 , _ ie _ five units of distance from a barrier of height 0.01 .",
    "the plot clearly demonstrates that the q - ball is repelled by the barrier .",
    "this repulsion is due to the tail of the q - ball which interacts with the barrier .",
    "the further away we place q - ball the smaller the tail and hence the weaker the repulsion but the repulsion is always there .",
    "so to study the scattering on the barrier we need to give the q - ball a boost .    , @xmath108 , placed at @xmath107 from a barrier of 0.01 height , width=377 ]    we have performed several simulations by boosting the q - balls with various small velocities .",
    "all these simulations have shown that , like for the topological solitons , the scattering is very elastic .",
    "there is very little radiation sent out and although the shape of the q - ball changes as it climbs the barrier - afterwards it returns to its original shape . looking at the dependence on the frequency ( _ ie _ @xmath78 ) of the q - ball we have noticed that the q - balls of higher value of @xmath78 get closer to the barrier .",
    "however , when we tried to determine the velocity at which they reach the top of the barrier ( _ ie _ the critical velocity ) this dependence on the frequency disappears .",
    "thus for a barrier of height 0.01 the numerically found value of @xmath109 was @xmath110 .",
    "as the scattering is very elastic we have tried to derive this value in the point particle approximation . in this case",
    "we look at the energy of the q - ball at rest at the top of the barrier and compare it with the energy of a moving q - ball away from the barrier . if the scattering is elastic the equality of these energies gives us a lower bound on the critical velocity .",
    "thus in our case    @xmath111    this energy should be very close to the rest mass energy of a q - ball at the top of a barrier given by    @xmath112    thus the critical velocity is given by @xmath113 so , let us use the above formula to estimate the critical velocity .",
    "the rest mass energy of the q - ball with @xmath106 , far away from the potential barrier , is @xmath114 while its rest mass at the top of a barrier of height 0.01 is @xmath115 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath116 ,    which is in an excellent agreement with the numerical value mentioned before .",
    "this was for the q - ball of @xmath106 .",
    "what about other values ? in table 1 .",
    "we present the calculated critical velocities for several values of @xmath24 .    [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < , < , < \" , ]     table 4 .",
    "these angles have been calculated numerically by using @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the velocities along the @xmath57- and @xmath120- axes , respectively .",
    "how do these results depend on the height of the barrier or the frequency of the q - ball ? or on the velocity of the q - ball ?",
    "we have performed further studies and have found that when a q - ball is sent at higher speed , the deflection angle is smaller .",
    "this is clearly due to the fact that at higher velocity the q - ball has more power to overcome the barrier and so gets nearer to the centre of the barrier .",
    "what about the dependence on the height of the barrier ?",
    "16 presents the trajectories of q - balls of frequency @xmath121 sent from @xmath122 towards the barriers of height 0.5 and 0.9 .",
    "we note that the deflection angle is smaller for the smaller barrier ; again , in this case the q - ball gets nearer to the centre of the barrier .",
    "sent from @xmath123 with velocity @xmath124 towards barriers of height 0.9 and 0.5.,width=529 ]    furthermore , we have also found that the deflection angle increases with the decrease of the q - ball charge ( _ ie _ @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "17 in which we present plot of trajectories of two q - balls ( with @xmath121 and 1.9 ) sent from @xmath125 with velocity 0.1 towards a barrier of height 0.9 located at @xmath126 .",
    "the deflection angles for the q - balls with @xmath121 and @xmath106 are found to be 31.955 and 40.167 , respectively .     and @xmath106 sent from @xmath125 with @xmath124 towards a barrier of height 0.9 located at @xmath127,width=529 ]      we have also studied the q - ball scattering on holes . like in the ( @xmath128 )",
    "dimensional case the whole process is more complicated than the scattering on barriers . as in the @xmath129 dimensional case the complications arise from the generation of ` baby ' q - balls in the hole and their repulsion .",
    "also the smaller the velocity the more time the ` parent ' q - ball has for generating these ` baby ' q - balls .",
    "this , coupled with the dependence on the impact parameter , makes the whole process very complicated .",
    "so here we present our preliminary results - leaving more detailed investigations for the future . however , these preliminary results are interesting enough to report them here .",
    "first of all let us note that , like in the ( @xmath130 dimensional case , the overall force between the q - ball and the hole can be repulsive , attractive or a mixture of these two and this depends on the velocity of the q - ball , its charge and the position and the depth of the hole .",
    "this dependence is mainly due to the conditions of the stability of the q - ball .",
    "when the q - balls , during the process of the scattering , remain stable the force between them and the hole is purely attractive and the process resembles the scattering on the barriers except that this time the deflection is towards the hole .",
    "however , the behaviour depends on the initial velocity ; the faster the q - balls move the less they are deflected by the hole .",
    "18 presents the trajectories of 3 q - balls ( of @xmath131 ) sent with velocities @xmath132 and @xmath133 when the hole ( of depth -0.9 ) was located at @xmath134 .",
    "the plots show very clearly that the force between the q - ball and the hole is attractive but the deflection decreases with the increase in the speed of the q - ball .     sent with various incoming velocities for a hole of depth -0.9 located at @xmath135.,width=529 ]    next we report the results of our study of the dependence on the impact parameter .",
    "19 presents the trajectories of the q - ball ( @xmath136 sent with velocity @xmath137 at various impact parameters , _ ie _ @xmath138 , and @xmath139 . as expected , we see that the deflection increases as we decrease the impact parameter ( when the q - balls are sent with the same velocity ) .     for a hole of depth -0.9 located at various impact parameters.,width=529 ]    as we decrease the impact parameter @xmath140 further , bringing the hole closer to the @xmath141-axis , the net interaction between the q - ball and the hole ceases being purely attractive and becomes partially repulsive and and partially attractive .",
    "this results in a complicated behaviour which is due to what we have seen in the one - dimensional scattering : the hole is no longer a passive object but rather a charged object ( due to the ` baby q - balls ' that have been generated in the hole ) and that affects the interaction . fig .",
    "20 presents the trajectory of the ` parent ' q - ball ( of @xmath131 ) sent with velocity 0.2 towards a hole located at @xmath142 .",
    "the figure shows very clearly that initially the scattering is repulsive and later becomes attractive .",
    "note the small scale of the @xmath120-axis which shows that the motion in the @xmath143 direction is very small .",
    "we have also checked that if we increase the velocity the repulsive behaviour disappears .",
    "hence the behaviour is very sensitive to the values of various parameters ( velocity or impact parameter ) .    ) sent with velocity @xmath144 towards a hole of depth -0.9 located at @xmath142.,width=529 ]    furthermore , when a q - ball is sent with a small velocity , it can interact with the hole earlier . at this stage",
    "the force is attractive and the q - ball has not yet had the time to generate many ` baby ' q - balls in the hole .",
    "thus the repulsive force is smaller or even disappears altogether and a purely attractive force is observed .",
    "21 presents the trajectories of 2 q - balls ( with @xmath131 ) sent with velocities @xmath145 @xmath146 towards a hole located at @xmath142 . from the figure one sees very clearly that the repulsive force seen in the case of @xmath146 disappears when",
    "the q - ball velocity is decreased to @xmath147 and that , in this latter case , the overall force is attractive .    ) sent with velocities @xmath146 and @xmath147 towards a hole of depth -0.9 located at @xmath142.,width=529 ]    the magnitude and the type of the overall force between the q - ball and the hole , when a q - ball is sent with a certain speed and at a certain impact parameter , depends also on the charge of the q - ball ( _ ie _ @xmath24 ) .",
    "22 presents the trajectories of q - balls of different charges ( different @xmath24 ) when each q - ball was sent with velocity 0.1 and towards a hole of -0.9 located at @xmath148 .",
    "we note a very strong dependence on the charge . sometimes the trajectories are deflected towards the hole , for other @xmath24 they are deflected in the other direction .",
    "the amount of the deflection also depends strongly on @xmath24 .",
    "clearly this is a complicated process which requires further investigation .",
    "one factor that certainly is partially responsible for this behaviour is the broadness of the profile functions .",
    "however , this broadness is basically monotonic ( but not at the tail ( see fig . 14 ) ) so it is hard to predict how much charge ( in the form of ` baby ' q - balls ) get generated in the hole and how this affects the overall scattering properties .",
    "all this behaviour requires more detailed further investigation",
    ".     sent with @xmath137 , a hole of -0.9 depth located at @xmath148 , width=529 ]    finally , we have also checked , numerically , that the forces are independent of the overall helicity , that is the force does not depend on the sign of @xmath24 .",
    "the behaviour is independent of whether we send a q - ball or an anti - q - ball at a hole located at the same position .",
    "the dynamics also does not depend on the sign of the impact parameter ; _ ie _ it is also still the same when a q - ball is sent ( with the same velocity ) towards a hole located at a corresponding negative impact parameter .",
    "as the forces between a q - ball and a hole are attractive in the region of stability of the q - ball all deflections can be cancelled if we send a q - ball symmetrically in - between two holes .",
    "then the only effect is a small attraction as the q - ball approaches the line joining the holes followed by a repulsion .",
    "so , in this case the q - ball behaves again like a point particle .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of our studies of the scattering of q - balls on potential obstructions ( in the form of potential barriers and holes ) in ( @xmath130 and @xmath149 dimensions . in our work",
    "we have tried to compare our results with similar results for topological solitons . and in many cases the results were similar ; however , some results were different as q - balls have some conditions that they have to satisfy to be stable .",
    "moreover , as their charge is not quantised they can , in the interaction with obstructions , generate further small q - balls ( called ` baby ' q - balls in this paper ) .",
    "we have found that in the barrier case the scattering of q - balls resembled very closely the scattering of topological solitons .",
    "the scattering was very elastic .",
    "for each barrier there was a critical velocity below which the q - ball was reflected and above which it was transmitted .",
    "what was surprising , at first sight , was that the value of this critical velocity did not depend on the charge of the q - ball ( _ ie _ it was independent of @xmath24 ) .",
    "as the scattering was very elastic we could estimate the value of this critical velocity by performing an energy analysis ( _ ie _ by comparing the energy of a boosted q - ball away from the barrier to the energy of q - ball at rest at the top of the barrier ) .",
    "the results were in an excellent agreement with what was seen in the numerical simulations .",
    "this suggests that , indeed , the scattering is very elastic and the approximation of q - balls by point - like particles is quite reliable .    for the scattering of q - balls on potential holes the situation was slightly different as the stable q - balls , when they fall into a hole can become unstable",
    "this instability translates into the generation of ` baby ' q - balls which can then interact with their ` parent ' .",
    "we have performed detailed studies of the scattering of q - balls on potential holes . when the q - balls are stable , and remain stable in the hole , they , again , resemble topological solitons . in this case",
    "they can either fall into the hole and get trapped in it or pass through it with a slightly reduced velocity .",
    "the scattering is , again , quite close to being elastic although this time more radiation is produced than in the case of a barrier .",
    "however , when a q - ball approaches the hole , especially when its parameters are close to the stability bounds , it produces small q - balls in the hole . as the basic force between q - balls can be of either sign ( it depends on their relative phase ) the ` baby ' q -",
    "balls then start interacting with each other and with the initial q - ball",
    ". the overall interaction can now be attractive or repulsive and this depends on the parameters of the configuration ( velocity and frequency of the q - ball , the position and the height of the hole etc ) .    in ( @xmath150 )",
    "dimensions we have looked at the scattering of a q - ball on a series of potential barriers whose position was varied along the @xmath120 axis .",
    "the q - ball was deflected from the potential barrier .",
    "we have found that the deflection angle depended on the impact parameter , the height of the barrier , the velocity and the charge @xmath151 of the q - ball . .",
    "we have also studied the interactions of stable q - balls with the hole in ( @xmath150 ) dimensions at various impact parameters .",
    "we have found the expected deflection towards the hole although the trajectories of the ` parent ' q - ball were slightly irregular .",
    "this irregularity increased at the lower impact parameters and it depended also on the velocity of the q - ball .",
    "when we studied the dependence of the impact parameter on the charge of the q - ball ( _ ie _ the frequency @xmath24 ) we have found a surprising irregularity as shown in fig .",
    "22 . for some frequencies the deflection was towards the hole , for some others away",
    "and it varied in magnitude in a very unpredictable way .",
    "clearly the overall forces in this case are very finely balanced .",
    "it is clear that to get a good understanding of the scattering on a hole requires further work .",
