    "is that in connection with the theory of quantum deformations .",
    "these quantum deformations are realized based on the @xmath0-poincar - hopf algebra @xcite and has direct implications on the quantum dynamics of relativistic and nonrelativistic quantum systems .",

    "the 3d dirac oscillator has been discussed in connection with the theory of quantum deformations in ref .",
    "however , it is well known that the 2d dirac oscillator exhibits a dynamics completely different from that of 3d one . in this context , the main goal of this letter is study the dynamics of the 2d dirac oscillator in the quantum deformed framework generated by the @xmath0-poincar - hopf algebra and after compare with the usual ( undeformed ) 2d dirac oscillator .",

    "in this section , we briefly discuss the usual 2d dirac oscillator for later comparison with the deformed one .",
    "one begins by writing the dirac equation for the four - component spinor @xmath7 @xmath8 the 2d dirac oscillator is obtained throught the nonmininal prescription in eq . where @xmath9 is the position vector .",
    "we shall now make use of the underlying symmetry of the system to reduce the four - component dirac equation to a two - component spinor equation .",
    "we use the following representation for the @xmath10 matrices @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the pauli matrices .",

    "it should be noted that the spectrum is spin dependent , and for @xmath29 the energy eigenvalues are independent of @xmath30 as depicted in the fig .",

    "in this letter , we considered the dynamics of the 2d dirac oscillator in the context of @xmath0-poincar - hopf algebra .",
    "using the fact that the deformation does not break the angular symmetry , we have derived the @xmath0-deformed radial differential equation whose solution has led to the deformed energy spectrum and wave functions .",
    "we verify that the energy spectrum and wave functions are modified by the presence of the deformation parameter @xmath70 . using values for the deformation parameter lower than the upper bound @xmath68",
