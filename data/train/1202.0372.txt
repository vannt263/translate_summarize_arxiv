    "the achievable rate is computed under two assumptions : ( a ) each relay node scales the received signal to the maximum extent possible subject to its transmit power constraint , ( b ) the nodes in all layers operate in the high - snr regime , where the received signal power @xmath0 at the @xmath1 node satisfies @xmath2 for some small @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of layers of relay nodes .",
    "it is shown that the rate achieved under these two assumptions approaches network capacity as the source power increases .",
    "the authors in @xcite extend this work to the scenarios where the nodes in at most one layer do not satisfy these two assumptions and show that achievable rates in such scenarios also approach the network capacity as the source power increases .",

    "computing the maximum rate achievable with analog network coding without these two assumptions , however , results in a computationally intractable problem , in general @xcite .",
    "our main contribution is a result that states that a globally optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes that maximizes the end - to - end rate in a general layered relay network can be computed layer - by - layer . in particular , a rate - optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes in a layer is the one that maximizes the sum - rate of the nodes in the next layer .",
    "this result allows us to exactly compute the optimal end - to - end rate achievable with analog network coding , over all possible choices of scaling factors for the nodes , in a class of layered networks that can not be so addressed using existing approaches .",
