    "the quasar q2237 + 0305 at a redshift of @xmath3 is lensed by a relatively nearby galaxy at @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is a quadruply - imaged case , and one of the best investigated lens systems , both observationally and theoretically . for recent work ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite , schmidt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , respectively .",
    "q2237 + 0305 was the first multiple quasar system in which microlensing was detected ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of well covered microlensing light curves of a quasar can be used to uncover its size and structure ( wambsganss et al .",
    "1990 , wambsganss & paczyski 1992 ) .",
    "a number of groups are optically monitoring this system to measure any microlensing effects .",
    "the expected time delay between the four images is only of order a day ( @xcite ) and hence unlikely to be determined from optical light curves .",
    "recently , hst observations in the uv allowed the determination of highly accurate relative positions of the four images ( blanton et al .",
    "1998 ) . with ground - based spectrophotometry ,",
    "an extended arc comprising three of the four images was discovered ( mediavilla et al . 1998 ) .",
    "not very much is known yet about gravitationally lensed quasars in x - rays .",
    "the double quasar q0957 + 561 was seen with heao-1 and with rosat , and dramatic differences in the flux of image b of up to a factor of five were observed @xcite .",
    "there is an x - ray selected gravitationally lensed quasar , rx j0911.4 + 0551 which was found in the rosat all - sky survey @xcite . with @xmath5 and an x - ray luminosity of @xmath6ergs",
    "/ s it is a very x - ray bright quasar .",
    "the two bright images are separated by 0.8 arcsec .",
    "high - resolution optical / infrared imaging revealed four images with a maximum distance of 3.1 arcsec ( @xcite , see also munoz et al .",
    "1999 or http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles for hst / nicmos data obtained by the castles collaboration ) .    here",
    "we present the first x - ray detection of q2237 + 0305 , an analysis of a rosat / hri observation .",
    "the combined x - ray emission of the four quasar images is clearly detected , though at a relatively low count rate .",
    "due to the coarse resolution of the rosat / hri the individual images are not resolved .",
    "we observed the quasar q2237 + 0305 with the rosat / hri ( @xcite ) for a total exposure time of @xmath7 seconds .",
    "the observations took place between november 20 and december 5 , 1997 . the standard analysis software system ( sass ) determined an average background rate of 0.0032 counts / sec / arcmin@xmath8 which  multiplied by the  exposure time \" @xmath9 yields an average of 171.7 background counts per square arcmin in total .    to determine the count rate of q2237 + 0305 , we extracted the photons in circles of different sizes and subtracted the background , whose count rate was determined from empty regions of considerably larger size .",
    "a circle with a radius of 15 arcseconds centered on the pixel with the highest count ( ra 22:40:30.21 , dec + 03:21:28.7 ; j2000 ) resulted in a total number of 361 counts .",
    "the average number of background photons determined from ten  empty \" circles nearby resulted in 39.8 background photons .",
    "this leaves 321.2 source counts , which results in a count rate of 6.0 counts per kilosecond . a similar determination with a much larger extraction radius of 50 arcseconds ( 100 pixels ) centered on position ra 22:40:30.0 , dec + 03:21:28.7 produced 800 counts .",
    "the average background for this size is 466.8 counts , which results in 333.2 source counts and a count rate of @xmath10 counts / ksec .",
    "the complete hri field of the exposure is shown in figure [ fig - hri ] .",
    "the central source is q2237 + 0305 ( labelled  1 \" ) .",
    "table [ tab - sources ] contains the positions and count rates of all the sources in the field that are detected with a s / n of at least 4.0 in one of the rosat / hri detection cells ( squares with sizes ranging from 12 to 120 arcsec side length ) . in the table",
    "we also list the count rates and possible identifications of these x - ray detections .",
    "cross - checking with the databases simbad and ned , we could find one other identification of an x - ray detection in our field with a catalogued source ( aside from the  target \" q2237 + 0305 ) : source no .",
    "2 coincides with the g0 star bd + 02 4540 ( v magnitude : 9.6 ) .",

    "the image appears slightly elliptical ; but the same small ellipticity is seen in other images as well and hence seems to be an artifact of imperfect pointing ( the separation of the four quasar images is only of order one arcsecond ; this can not explain the apparent extension ) .",
    "the average rate of @xmath11 counts / ksec translates into an energy flux of @xmath12 erg / sec/@xmath1 in the interval 0.1 - 2.4 kev , with the assumption of a hydrogen column density of @xmath13 @xmath14 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and a power law index ( photon ) of @xmath15 .",
    "this flux can be converted into an x - ray luminosity in the rosat energy window of @xmath16erg / sec .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the quasar must be lower , since due to the gravitational lensing there is a magnification of at least a few , possibly even a few hundred ( @xcite ) .    as briefly mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it is of great interest to study any variability of this quasar .",
    "the standard rosat / sass analysis did not find any indication for variability in q2237 + 0305 .",
    "with only about 330 source photons spread over two weeks in real time , it is difficult to determine any variability . in figure",
    "[ fig - timing ] , we display the observing intervals of this x - ray exposure for possible comparison with observations in other wave bands at the same time .",
    "the  zero \" on the time axis corresponds to november 20 , 1997 , 01:49:58 ut ( or jd 2450772.576 ) .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the  coverage factor \" is less than 5% .",
    "so it makes no sense to present a continuous light curve of q2237 + 0305 over the observing period .",
    "we can also  bin \" the data to compare the q2237 + 0305  light curve \" with the light curve of the  background \" ( or of the other seven detected sources , cf .",
    "table [ tab - sources ] ) .",
    "such a binned artificial light curve is displayed in figure [ fig - lightcurve ] for bin widths of 1000 seconds ) ] .",
    "the top panel is the x - ray light curve for q2237 + 0305 , the bottom panel is the  light curve \" of a background field with the same average count rate ( 6.2 counts per ksec ) . in order to find out whether the  peaks \" in the quasar light curve could be due to enhanced background radiation , we chose to compare the quasar light curve with a background light curve normalized to the same average count rate .",
    "figure [ fig - lightcurve ] shows that the fluctuations in the flux of q2237 + 0305 are uncorrelated with the variations in the background flux .",
    "there is no obvious variability visible at the top of figure [ fig - lightcurve ] that exceeds any variability in the bottom panel ( which sets the  noise \" level ) .",
    "neither is there any  correlated \" variability obvious , which could be expected for a highly increased background at certain phases of the observation ( since the extraction circle of the q2237 + 0305 light curve is much smaller than that for the background , this would be surprising ) .",
    "we investigated the issue of variability more quantitatively .",
    "we performed a ks - test with the real arriving times of the source photons of q2237 + 0305 ( extraction radius 30 arcseconds ) , comparing them with the background light curve of a circular region corresponding to the same total number of photons and for the total background . both were consistent with no variability",
    "furthermore , we performed a chi - square test with the binned data .",
    "similarly , we found no indication for variability .    among the 53 bins , the bin with the highest count contains 15 photons , and one bin is completely empty .",
    "the poissonian probability for finding 15 counts for an average of 6.2 is only about @xmath17 , the poissonian probability for finding 0 counts with the same average is @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , if one divides the bins in two sets , the first 26 bins contain 150 counts ; the standard variation for an average of 150 counts is @xmath19 counts .",
    "the second 26 bins contain 194 counts , which is 2.4 @xmath20 above the counts of the first half .",
    "these two tests leave open the possibility of source variability , but at very low significance .",
    "another issue is a possible contamination of the x - ray counts by the ( lensing ) galaxy .",
    "we estimated the x - ray luminosity of this galaxy both by using dellantonio et al .",
    "( 1994 ) s correlation @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is in erg s@xmath23 and @xmath24 is in solar luminosities ) , as well as by extrapolating from the known x - ray count rate of m31 ( west et al .",
    "both these estimates result in a possible contribution of the lensing galaxy of less than one percent of our detection , which hence can be neglected .",
    "the detection of the quadruply - imaged quasar q2237 + 0305 in x - rays with ( @xmath25 ) counts per ksec opens up the possibility of being able to monitor this system with the next generation of x - ray telescopes ( chandra x - ray observatory , xmm , astro - e ) .",
    "it would then be feasible to study both the intrinsic variability of the quasar and microlens - induced fluctuations .",
    "the chandra x - ray observatory with its on - axis resolution of 0.5 arcsec and its effective area almost twice as large as rosat s will be able to detect and resolve the four images of q2237 + 0305 .",
    "in addition to the possibility of determining microlens - induced fluctuations ( see yonehara et al .",
    "1998 ) , such observations could offer the opportunity of measuring relative time delays in this system .",
    "intrinsic x - ray variations of the lensed quasar on time scales of less than a day would be required . on the other hand , if one could follow a  caustic crossing event \" in x - rays ( which should appear in only one of the four images , according to the very high magnifications expected due to the small source size ) , we could also have the possibility of determining the size or even the source profile of the x - ray emission region of the quasar .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank ingo lehmann for providing help with his midas tools .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "this research has also made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france ."
