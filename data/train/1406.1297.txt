    "the application of general relativity to understand modern astrophysical data about the large - scale structure and properties of our universe leads to the necessity to postulate the existence of two dark substances , namely dark matter , in order to explain the structure formation , and dark energy to justify the observed faintness of the extra - galactic sne ia , which is considered as the evidence of accelerating expansion of the present - day universe @xcite .",
    "concerning the physical properties of these substances , it is known that dark matter is gravitating , while dark energy is antigravitating .",
    "the competition between these two components of the dark sector of matter - energy in the universe determines the dynamics of the expansion which can change with time from deceleration , when dark matter is dominated , to acceleration , when the repulsive action of dark energy is predominant .",
    "theoretically , one can not exclude the inverse effect , when acceleration changes with time to deceleration , and the presence of the epoch , in which the corresponding forces are put in equilibrium .    since the physical nature of dark matter and dark energy remains unknown for now , numerous different models were proposed in terms of the field - theoretical concept ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "the transition from the matter dominated phase to the dark energy dominated universe took place at the redshift @xmath0 .",
    "it does not contradict with the obtained condition @xmath288 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) which determines the stage of transition to the phase of accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "in this paper , the evolution of the universe is studied in exactly solvable dynamical quantum model with the robertson - walker metric .",
    "it is shown that the equation of motion which describes the expansion or contraction of the universe can be represented in the form of the zero total energy conservation law ( [ 16 ] ) for the particle being an analogue of the universe .",
    "the analogue particle has an arbitrary mass and moves in the potential well ( [ 17 ] ) under the action of the internal force ( [ 23 ] ) which takes into account the curvature of space , mass term , and gradients ( pressures ) of classical and quantum gravitational sources .",
    "the quantum source ( [ 18 ] ) emerges as a result of the evolution of the phase @xmath289 of the state vector ( [ 15 ] ) , which describes the geometrical properties of the quantum universe , in the space of the scale factor .",
    "equation ( [ 22 ] ) for the phase @xmath289 is non - linear , and contains the information about the curvature of space and quantum states of matter in the universe .    in a particular case of matter in the form of dust",
    ", this non - linear equation has the analytical solutions of two types : ( i ) real solution for the euclidean phase @xmath290 ( [ 37 ] ) which corresponds to the real state vector @xmath169 from ( [ 36 ] ) ( universe of type i ) ; ( ii ) complex solution @xmath172 ( [ 38 ] ) for the state vector @xmath171 from ( [ 36 ] ) in the space of complex scale factor ( universe of type ii ) .",
    "it is shown that , as the universe of type i evolves , it subsequently passes through the phases ( stages ) of the accelerating and decelerating expansion . the phases change each other with the interval of the order of planck length in displacement scale of @xmath152 .",
    "the description of the motion of the analogue particle as a mathematical equivalent of the evolving universe of type ii is characterized by two types of possible solutions for the real and imaginary parts of the kinetic energy ( [ 27 ] ) of types @xmath253 and @xmath262 .",
    "the solution of type @xmath253 describes the motion of the analogue particle in real time @xmath4 , while the solution of type @xmath262 corresponds to imaginary time @xmath291 .",
    "the changes of the real and imaginary parts of the kinetic energy of one type during the evolution of the universe demonstrate that the internal forces simultaneously perform both the positive work on the universe ( e.g. , the energy @xmath251 increases as in fig .",
    "5 ) , which is analogous to the work of the forces of dark energy , and the negative work ( the energy @xmath252 decreases ) , which is similar to the work of the attractive forces of dark matter .",
    "the general character of the expansion of the universe of type ii at a definite instant of time ( parametrized by the deviation @xmath229 in fig .",
    "6 ) depends on which of the works dominates . as in the case of the universe of type i ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the expansion of the universe becomes accelerating after reaching the region @xmath277 .",
    "this result does not contradict the data on the expansion of our universe in the modern era and predicts that the forces of attraction and repulsion will exactly compensate each other in infinite future ( @xmath292 ) .    in approach under consideration ,",
    "the change of the regimes of the expansion of the universe of both types is not caused by the action of some specific material carrier of mass - energy .",
    "this phenomenon reflects a quantum nature of the universe .",
    "the equations of the quantum theory ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 16a ] ) transform into the einstein - friedmann equations of general relativity ( [ 23a ] ) without dark energy in the limit @xmath293 .",
    "thus , it appears that the quantum universe is such that , during its expansion , it decelerates , then accelerates , or vice versa , spontaneously .",
    "the cause of the expansion and change of its regimes is a special form of the potential well ( [ 17 ] ) in which the universe as a whole is moving ."
