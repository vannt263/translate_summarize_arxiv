    "one of the most powerful method of predicting nuclear ground state properties and excitations all over the nuclear chart is the microscopic approach based on the self - consistent mean - field theory  @xcite . within this kind of approach , the nuclear mean - field",
    "is determined from a variational technique of the hartree - fock ( hf ) type applied to a many - body hamiltonian . in order to be tractable up to the heaviest nuclei , the method",
    "is usually applied by employing phenomenological effective two - body interactions such as the skyrme  @xcite or the gogny  @xcite forces .",
    "it is well known that an accurate description of nuclear structure almost always requires taking into account correlations beyond the simple hf approximation",
    ". one important class of these correlations , namely pairing correlations , are commonly treated using the bcs or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theories .",
    "a second class of correlations comes from the coupling of the nucleon motion to collective oscillations of the mean field . depending on the amplitude of collective oscillations ,",
    "these correlations are usually derived either from the random phase approximation ( rpa ) theory or from the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "let us emphasize that , in addition to numerous standard nuclear properties , correlations are expected to play a key role in the interpretation of the unusual structure recently found in some nuclei such as the so - called parity inversions observed in the ground state and low - lying excitations of exotic light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "most techniques used for including correlations suffer from defects that may be an obstacle to an accurate description of nuclear structure observables . for instance , proton and neutron numbers are not conserved in the bcs and hfb schemes .",
    "this deficiency is known to render these theories inadequate for describing superfluid to normal phase transitions and , more generally , situations where pairing correlations are small . as a consequence",
    ", the precision of the approximations consisting in treating simple excitations as multi - quasiparticle states in even - even and odd - even nuclei becomes questionable .",
    "similarly , the quasi - boson approximation employed in rpa generates violations of the pauli principle that require to introduce corrections to the mean - value of one - body operators and render delicate a microscopic treatment of particle - vibration coupling .",
    "these difficulties can be obviated by having recourse to particle number projection techniques in the case of pairing or to extensions of rpa that do not make use of the quasi - boson approximation .",
    "however , these techniques complicate numerical algorithms considerably .",
    "for instance , in order to get a realistic description of weak pairing situations necessitates to perform the particle number projections _ before _ variation  @xcite . in the same way , extensions of the rpa avoiding the violation of pauli correlations as e.g.",
    ", the self - consistent rpa  @xcite require significant additional numerical effort .    in view of this",
    ", an alternative approach has been proposed in ref.@xcite , which consists of taking a ground state trial wave function in the form of a linear combination of multiparticle - multihole ( m@xmath0-m@xmath1 ) operators acting upon the hf state .",
    "the relevance of taking as a starting point a set of hf single - particle states has been pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion is thought to be truncated at a given order and the mixing coefficients are determined by minimizing the total energy of the system .",
    "the interest of such a trial wave function is of course to exactly conserve nucleon numbers and be fully consistent with the pauli principle . in lowest order , in which only @xmath2-@xmath3 configurations are considered ,",
    "one gets the well - known tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) @xcite . adding @xmath4-@xmath5 and higher order configurations allows one to describe ground state correlations of the most general form , including pairing and rpa correlations . in the simplest application of this method ,",
    "a hf calculation is performed and the secular equation involving the matrix elements of the residual interaction is diagonalized .",
    "the coefficients of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 superposition for the ground state are then taken from the eigenvector belonging to the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "the eigenvectors belonging to the next few higher eigenvalues can be interpreted as approximately representing the lowest excitations of the system .",
    "let us point out that the advantage of building m@xmath0-m@xmath1 configurations from hf single - particle states lies in the fact that an important part of two - body correlations is already included in the nuclear mean field .",
    "one therefore expects that the effect of the residual interaction is small enough to allow a fast convergence of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion so that only the lowest orders will have to be retained .",
    "a more elaborate version of this method is to allow the hf single particle themselves to be included as variational parameters in the energy minimization .",
    "this procedure yields additional equations from which renormalized single particle states can be derived .",
    "the method then is similar to the multi - configuration hartree - fock ( mchf ) approach which is widely used in atomic and molecular physics  @xcite .",
    "the interest of introducing such a consistency between the single - particle structure and the correlated ground state is that additional parts of two - body correlations are further included in the nuclear mean field . in this situation",
    "even lower orders in the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion should be necessary to describe ground state correlations compared to the case without single - particle state renormalization . an approximate but numerically far less demanding way of implementing such a self - consistent definition of single - particle states is to derive them from the mean - field calculated with the _ correlated _ ground state one - body density matrix .",
    "this latter kind of self - consistency has been tested in ref.@xcite for correlations generated by a zero - range residual interaction in a@xmath6180 nuclei .",
    "the result was that the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion could be truncated at 4 particles4 holes .",
    "taking the single - particle states entering the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion from a self - consistent mean - field is the essential difference between the method of ref.@xcite and the particle number conserving treatments of the pairing hamiltonian proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it differs in the same respect from the large - scale shell model approach which is widely applied to light nuclei and to heavier nuclei near closed shells  @xcite . in addition , contrary to shell model calculations , the whole single - particle spectrum is _ a priori _ considered in the definition of m@xmath0-m@xmath1 configurations , the space truncation resulting from imposing a limit on the order @xmath7 of the @xmath8-@xmath9 configurations included .    in principle , given a many - body hamiltonian capable of describing both the nuclear mean - field and the main kinds of correlations beyond the mean field , such an approach can be implemented in a fully microscopic way .",
    "this can be done in particular by choosing a many - body effective hamiltonian built with the standard density dependent effective forces which have proved to give a precise account of pairing and rpa correlations . in this case , the coefficients of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion can be derived by applying a variational principle to the total nuclear energy .",
    "the application of the method of ref.@xcite then appears as a straightforward generalization of hfb and rpa calculations , without the above mentioned particle number and pauli violations .",
    "still , conceivable applications to realistic situations in nuclei require that one is able to describe relevant correlations using a small enough number of particle - hole excitations in the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion . in order to test the capacity of the method to describe the correlations generated by a pairing residual interaction ,",
    "we have applied it to the exactly solvable hamiltonian proposed long time ago by richardson  @xcite .",
    "this simple model consists of a system of 2n identical fermions distributed over a set of 2n equally spaced , twofold degenerate levels @xcite . the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 method has been applied to this hamiltonian under the form of multiple @xmath10-@xmath11 excitations , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the time - reversed of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "particle numbers and pairing strengths have been explored within ranges of values corresponding to typical situations found in realistic nuclei .",
    "ground state correlation energies , occupation probabilities and odd - even mass differences have been calculated and compared with the exact results given by richardson for different numbers of @xmath10-@xmath11 excitations .",
    "let us emphasize that the purpose of the present work is not to discuss the interpretation of the calculated quantities and their connection to pairing in real nuclei .",
    "our goal is simply to check the ability of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 approach to describe pairing correlations within a model where exact solutions exist .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present additional detail concerning the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 configuration mixing method .",
    "we also give the richardson expression of the exact ground state solution of the pairing hamiltonian .",
    "results obtained with the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 method are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "in the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 configuration mixing method the ground state wave function of the system is written as a superposition of a hf slater determinant @xmath14 and particle - hole excitations built upon it : @xmath15 the creation operators associated with unoccupied and occupied single particle states in @xmath16 are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively and the @xmath19 are configuration mixing coefficients to be determined . in compact form ,",
    "eq.([e1 ] ) can be written : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes an ordered set of indices specifying a given @xmath22-@xmath9 configuration , @xmath23 is the wave function obtained by acting with the corresponding @xmath8-@xmath9 operator on latexmath:[$|\\phi_{0 } > \\equiv    configurations of @xmath8-@xmath25 type ( @xmath26 ) and m is an integer parameter .",
    "the configuration mixing coefficients @xmath27 are obtained by minimizing the total energy of the system : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lagrange parameter related to the conservation of the norm of @xmath30 .    when @xmath31 is independent of the nuclear density , the conditions ( [ e3 ] ) are equivalent to the secular equation expressing the diagonalization of @xmath31 in the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 space : @xmath32 and the complex conjugate one .    in this work",
    "we choose for @xmath31 the pairing hamiltonian : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the time - reversed state of @xmath35 .",
    "the exact ground state of this hamiltonian for the case of a system of 2n fermions has been derived by richardson  @xcite : @xmath36 where the operator @xmath37 creates a collective pair : @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the fermion vacuum .",
    "the quantities @xmath40 are the solutions of a set of n nonlinear equations @xcite : @xmath41 and the exact ground state energy of the system is given by : @xmath42    the solutions of the pairing hamiltonian can be classified by the eigenvalues of the seniority operator : @xmath43 which counts the number of unpaired particles present in the system . in the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 scheme",
    "the ground state of the pairing hamiltonian which corresponds to seniority zero can be generated by considering in ( [ e2 ] ) only configurations @xmath8-@xmath44-@xmath45 with even values @xmath7=2@xmath46 .",
    "if one includes in expansion ( [ e2 ] ) all @xmath8-@xmath9 configurations up to @xmath47=2@xmath48 , the wave function @xmath30 becomes equivalent to the exact wave function @xmath49 .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the relationship between the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 configuration mixing method presented above and the projected - bcs ( pbcs ) approach @xcite , employed for restoring particle number conservation in finite fermi systems . in the pbcs approach",
    "the ground state has a pair condensate structure obtained by replacing in eq.([e6 ] ) the n pair operators @xmath37 by a unique collective pair : @xmath50 where the amplitudes @xmath51 are determined variationally .",
    "the pbcs wave function can be written also in terms of particle - hole operators acting on the hf state @xcite : @xmath52 ) are formed by restricting the summation in ( [ e11 ] ) to hole ( particle ) states and replacing @xmath51 by @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . from ( [ e12 ] )",
    "it can be seen that the pbcs wave function belongs to a particular subset of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 wave functions ( [ e2 ] ) in which the mixing coefficients have a separable form in the indices associated with particles and holes .",
    "it is known that , when the @xmath51 s are determined from projection before variation , pbcs wave - functions give a satisfactory description of weak pairing regimes and of the crossover from normal to superfluid phases in fermi systems .",
    "one therefore expects that the more general m@xmath0-m@xmath1 form ( [ e1 ] ) is able to provide an accurate description of pairing correlations in these situations .",
    "in addition , since the @xmath53 and @xmath54 are small , only the first few terms in ( [ e1 ] ) should be necessary .    in order to test the convergence of expansion ( [ e1 ] ) in all pairing regimes",
    ", the ground state solution of the hamiltonian ( [ e6 ] ) has been calculated using eq.([e4 ] ) for two systems , one with 2n=8 particles distributed among 8 equidistant levels , and the other one with 2n=16 particles distributed among 16 equidistant levels .",
    "the levels are twofold degenerate .",
    "these two systems simulate the level densities and pairing diffusivities found in weakly and moderately superfluid nuclei , respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath55 has been varied in a large range of values around typical pairing strengths in nuclei .",
    "the number of seniority - zero states of the 2n particle system is equal to the binomial coefficient @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for the systems with 2n=8 and 2n=16 particles the total number of seniority - zero states which should eventually be used for exactly calculating the ground states of the two systems is equal to 70 and 12870 , respectively .",
    "we study here the convergence properties of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion ( [ e1 ] ) as a function of the maximum particle - hole order @xmath47 and of an energy cut - off in the energy of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 configurations .",
    "the numbers of @xmath57-@xmath58 configurations for @xmath59 between 2 and 8 are shown in table  [ table1 ] for the two systems .",
    "the highest number of configurations is reached when @xmath7 is equal to half the number of particles .",
    "the numbers of configurations for various cut - off energies @xmath60 are given in table  [ table2 ] . here and in the following , energies are in units of the equidistant level spacing @xmath61 .    .",
    "number of @xmath57-@xmath58 configurations for given values of @xmath59 between 2 and 8 for the systems with 2n=8 and 2n=16 particles . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in tables  [ table3]-[table4 ] the results are shown for several values of the pairing strength @xmath55 . in the bcs approximation",
    "there is a sharp transition between the normal and the superfluid phase which appears at @xmath62 for 2n=8 and @xmath63 for 2n=16 .",
    "below these critical values of the pairing strength the correlation energies are zero in the bcs approximation .",
    "this is not the case for the exact solution , which shows a rather smooth increase of the correlation energy with the pairing strength .    from tables",
    "[ table3]-[table4 ] we also notice that , in the bcs approximation , the correlation energies are strongly underestimated .",
    "the error made is more than @xmath64 for all the values of the pairing strength listed in tables  [ table3]-[table4 ] . the same large differences are obtained between the pairing gaps associated in bcs with the odd - even mass differences , and the exact values of p(2n ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that the errors in the bcs correlation energies remain rather large , more than @xmath65 , even for large values of the pairing strength for which the ratio @xmath66 between the bcs pairing gap and the level spacing ( which in our case is the energy unit ) is of the order of 20 .",
    "let us emphasize however that in bcs or hfb calculations applied to real nuclei , the pairing strengths for neutrons and protons  or the matrix elements of the pairing residual interaction  are adjusted in order to correctly describe pairing correlations in strongly superfluid nuclei .",
    "consequently , bcs or hfb results should be taken with caution only in weak pairing regimes .    from tables",
    "[ table3]-[table4 ] one can see that the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion is converging rapidly to the exact results .",
    "thus , for the system with 16 particles a truncation to @xmath67-@xmath68 provides rather accurate values for the correlation energies @xmath69 .",
    "this truncation order should be compared to the maximum possible order of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion , which is @xmath70-@xmath71 in this case . as seen in table  [ table1 ] , for a truncation at @xmath67-@xmath68",
    "the number of configurations is equal to 3136 , while the total number of seniority - zero configurations is 12870 .    .",
    "the curves corresponds to various pairing strength values listed in the inset .",
    "the results are for the systems with 2n=8 and 2n=16 particles.,height=245 ]    next , we examine the convergence of the results as a function of the energy cut - off @xmath60 . in this truncation scheme",
    "we consider only m@xmath0-m@xmath1 configurations whose excitation energies are smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "the number of configurations for various @xmath60 values are shown in table  [ table2 ] . in fig.[figure2 ] the evolution of @xmath72 with @xmath60 is shown for several values of the pairing strength @xmath55 .     for the single - particle levels @xmath73 .",
    "the calculated points are joined by straight lines .",
    "the curves correspond to different truncation orders specified in the insets , the full line showing the exact values .",
    "the results are for the system with 2n=8 particles.,width=283 ]    from these figures and from table  [ table2 ] one can see that , for the values of @xmath55 of physical interest ( @xmath74 ) the number of configurations needed to achieve the same accuracy as previously is smaller . thus , in the case of the system with 16 particles and for g=0.54 one needs a cut - off energy @xmath60=50 in order to get an accuracy of @xmath75 . as seen in table",
    "[ table2 ] , for this cut - off energy one selects 3250 configurations up to 8@xmath0 - 8@xmath1 . on the other hand , in the truncation scheme based on the order of the particle - hole expansion , to achieve the same accuracy one needed to consider all configurations up to @xmath67-@xmath68 that is , from table  [ table1 ] , 3984 configurations",
    "this is about @xmath64 more than in the truncation based on cut - off energy .",
    "in particular a large number  about one third  of the 6@xmath0 - 6@xmath1 configurations of table  [ table1 ] are eliminated by the cut - off .",
    "since the same precision is achieved , this means that these eliminated configurations do not contribute to the correlation energy .",
    "let us mention that a 50 mev cut - off in the excitation energy of scattered pairs is consistent with the results of bcs or hfb calculations in actual nuclei , even in strongly superfluid ones .     for 2n=16 particles.,width=283",
    "]      the occupation probability @xmath76 of the single - particle level @xmath73 is given by :    @xmath77    the occupation probabilities of all single - particle levels in the cases 2n=8 and 2n=16 are plotted in figs.[figure5]-[figure6 ] for three values of the pairing strength @xmath55 .",
    "it can be seen that for small values of @xmath55 the exact values of occupation probabilities are rather well reproduced by a truncation to @xmath78 configurations .",
    "however , for the highest values of @xmath55 listed in tables  [ table3]-[table4 ] i.e. , @xmath55=1.0 for 2n=8 and @xmath55=0.66 for 2n=16 , one needs to introduce up to @xmath67-@xmath68 configurations in order to get an accurate description of occupation probabilities in the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 scheme .",
    "this truncation order appears consistent with the behaviour of correlation energies discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the convergence properties of the multiparticle - multihole ( m@xmath0-m@xmath1 ) configuration mixing approach .",
    "the study was done for a pairing hamiltonian with a constant pairing force , which can be solved exactly . for the single - particle model",
    "we have chosen a sequence of doubly - degenerate and equidistant levels , half - filled with one kind of fermions .",
    "the parameters of the model and the number of particles have been chosen so as to simulate the physical situation met in light and medium nuclei .",
    "the pairing strength @xmath55 has been varied from zero up to about twice the value corresponding to typical conditions in atomic nuclei .",
    "we have shown that a truncation based on the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 expansion is converging rather rapidly to the exact results for the ground state correlation energies and occupation probabilities of single - particle levels .",
    "for instance , with a value of @xmath55 corresponding to standard nuclear pairing , one can get an accuracy of about @xmath79 for the correlation energy in a system of 16 particles if one considers configurations up to @xmath67-@xmath68 .",
    "the number of these configurations is about four times smaller than the total number of possible m@xmath0-m@xmath1 configurations with seniority zero that the system can form .",
    "an even faster convergence without precision loss is found by selecting configurations whose excitation energies are limited by a cut - off corresponding to the maximum energy of scattered pairs .",
    "these encouraging results indicate that applications of the m@xmath0-m@xmath1 approach to fully microscopic self - consistent calculations in nuclei should be possible with present - day numerical capabilities .",
