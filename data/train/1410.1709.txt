    "@xmath1-ray space telescope affords an ideal opportunity to investigate the inner workings of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . to date , _ fermi _ has spent over 95% of its lifetime in _ all - sky - survey _ observing mode , whereby the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard _ fermi _ points away from the earth and rocks north and south of its orbital plane on consecutive orbits .",
    "this rocking motion of the _ fermi_-lat detector , coupled with it s large effective area , allows _",
    "fermi _ to scan the entire @xmath1-ray sky every two orbits , or approximately every three hours ( @xcite ) .",
    "the scanning ability of the lat has allowed us to catch agn during brief flares of @xmath1-ray activity ( e.g. @xcite ) , with these flares sometimes resulting in the discovery of very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath0 gev ) emission from the agn ( e.g. @xcite & @xcite ) .    while its three hour scan period is important for catching brief periods of flare activity from agn , coupling _",
    "fermi_-lat s continual scanning of the sky with a long mission lifetime allows us to construct a deep exposure of the extragalactic @xmath1-ray sky .",
    "this deep exposure affords us the ability to perform searches for faint vhe sources which would otherwise would go undetected by the pointed observations of ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iact ) arrays .",
    "utilising such an approach , a recent study of a deep @xmath7 year _ fermi_-lat exposure uncovered vhe emission from the bl lac object rbs 0970 ( @xcite ) .",
    "rbs 0679 , also known as bzb j0543 - 5532 , is a point like radio source , at a redshift of z @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",

    "recently the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration has published an upper limit on rbs 0679 of @xmath10 , from 8.1 hours of observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the energy threshold for this upper limit was 390 gev .",

    "observations found that , even after accounting for absorption of the @xmath1-ray flux by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , this upper limit is not compatible with a simple power - law extrapolation of rbs 0679 s 2lac spectrum to above 390 gev .",
    "this suggests the presence of an intrinsic break in the @xmath1-ray spectrum , not associated with the process of ebl absorption .    this paper reports the discovery of vhe emission from rbs 0679 . using the same approach that discovered rbs 0970 as a vhe source , 5.3 years of _",

    "the _ fermi_-lat observations and analysis routines used in this study are described , along with the results of the @xmath12 gev likelihood analysis .",
    "the results of the vhe study of rbs 0679 are shown in 3 .",
    "a brief investigation into the global @xmath1-ray characteristics of rbs 0679 when the vhe emission occurs is presented in 4 , with the conclusions given in 5 .",
    "it should be highlighted that this paper reports the discovery of vhe emission from rbs 0679 .",
    "a follow - up publication with sed modelling and interpretation is currently in preparation and will follow shortly .",
    "the data used in this study comprises all _ fermi_-lat event and spacecraft data taken during the first 5.3 years of _ fermi_-lat operation , from 2008 august 4 to 2013 december 12 , which equates to a mission elapsed time ( met ) interval of 239557417 to 408871812 .",

    "the good time intervals were generated by applying a filter expression of `` ( data_qual@xmath171 ) & & ( lat_config@xmath171 ) & & abs(rock_angle)@xmath18 52 '' to the data , where the ( data_qual ) and ( lat_config ) flags remove sub - optimal data affected by spacecraft events and the ( abs(rock_angle ) ) flag removes data periods where the lat detector rocking is greater than 52@xmath2 .    throughout this analysis , version v9r32p5 of the _ fermi science tools _ was used in conjunction with the p7rep_clean_v15 and p7rep_source_v15 instrument response functions ( irfs ) .",
    "the irfs defines how the lat detector performs for various parameters such as incident photon energy , incident angle and location of photon conversion within the detector . during the analysis , a model file consisting of both point and diffuse sources of @xmath1-rays",
    "was employed .",
    "in particular , the model file consisted of the most recent galactic and extragalactic diffuse models , and all @xmath1-ray point sources within a 18@xmath2 roi centered on rbs 0679 .",
    "the positions of these point sources , along with their spectral shapes , were taken from the second fermi source catalogue ( 2fgl ; @xcite ) . located 13@xmath2.03 from rbs 0679 ,",
    "the extended @xmath1-ray emission associated with the large magellanic cloud was accounted for with the _ fermi_-lat collaboration s lmc.fits spatial model , with the normalisation and spectral parameters frozen to their 2fgl values .",
    "the normalisation factor of the extragalactic diffuse emission was left free to vary , while the galactic diffuse template was multiplied by a power law in energy , the normalisation of which was left free to vary .",

    "the normalisation and spectral parameters of all point sources within 13@xmath2 of rbs 0679 were left free to vary , while the normalisation and spectral parameters for all point sources within an annulus of 13@xmath2 to 18@xmath2 from rbs 0679 were fixed to those published in the 2fgl catalogue .    utilising the above described model",
    ", the binned likelihood analysis of the 5.3 year data set , utilising the p7rep_source_v15 irf , resulted in the following best - fit power law function for rbs 0679 :    @xmath22    @xmath23    which equates to an integrated flux , in the @xmath12 gev energy range , of    @xmath24    taking only statistical errors into account .",

    "the long exposure of the analysed observations can result in additional faint sources being present in the data that are not present in the 2fgl .",
    "if these sources are present in the data , and not properly accounted for within the model file utilised during the likelihood analysis , they can artifically increase the significance of the @xmath1-ray flux from rbs 0679 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite & @xcite ) . to check",
    "if indeed any additional sources were present , a residual count map was constructed in the @xmath12 gev energy range . shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the residuals map was obtained by subtracting a ` model ' map gev likelihood fit of equation 1 .",

    "the detection of three ultraclean events within 0.1@xmath2 of rbs 0679 , coupled with the results of the @xmath6 gev unbinned likelihood analysis , suggest the vhe detection of rbs 0679 is a robust result . while the extrapolation of rbs 0679 s spectrum , as reported in previous _ fermi_-lat catalogues , is inconsistent with the recently announced h.e.s.s .",
