    "hod @xcite was the first to conjecture that the highly damped limit of the black hole quasinormal frequency was related to the fundamental area unit in the quantum theory of gravity . at that time , this limit was known only numerically @xcite , @xmath1 as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "he noticed that 0.0437123 is very close to @xmath4 . using bohr s correspondence principle",
    ", he was able to derive the area spectrum of the quantum schwarzschild black hole to be @xmath5 comparing hod s result with the expressions of the area and entropy spectra obtained in the theory of loop quantum gravity , dreyer @xcite determined the value of the immirzi parameter , an otherwise arbitrary constant in the theory . at the same time , because of the presence of @xmath6 , he also suggested that the gauge group should be changed from su(2 ) to so(3 ) .",
    "although this connection between the asymptotic quasinormal frequency and the immirzi parameter has been questioned @xcite , it has nevertheless aroused a lot of research interests in this direction .",
    "the first analytic evaluation of the asymptotic quasinormal frequency was carried out by motl and neitzke @xcite using the monodromy method .",
    "subsequently , with this method , the calculation has been extended to other kinds of black holes @xcite .",
    "however , all these calculations are done with respect to fields with integral spins . in this paper",
    ", we would like to further consider the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies of fields with half - integral spins like the dirac and the rarita - schwinger fields , which are lacking so far . on the other hand ,",
    "we hope our consideration will also shed light on the question of universality of the value of @xmath6 studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this value is indeed obtained in most of the cases for single - horizon black holes .",
    "we would like to see if this universality can be applied to fields with different spins .    in the next section , we first consider the case of the schwarzschild black hole . to deal with different spin fields in a unified way",
    ", we use the wkb formalism of andersson and howls @xcite , in addition to the monodromy method , to evaluate the asymptotic frequencies . here",
    "we also address the discrepancy on the value of the imaginary part of the dirac asymptotic frequency in @xcite and @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we turn to the case of the charged reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "we shall consider both the non - extremal and the extremal black holes .",
    "since the horizon structures are different in these two cases , one can not take the extremal limit directly .",
    "a separate calculation is thus carried out carefully in this section . in so doing ,",
    "we would also hope to resolve the discrepancies in the value of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies for the extremal black holes in the literature @xcite .",
    "moreover , this calculation is also interesting because the spin 1 , the spin 3/2 , and the spin 2 fields together in the extremal black hole spacetime represent the simplest supersymmetric situation .",
    "we would like to see how their asymptotic frequencies are related in this case @xcite .",

    "we have listed the effective potentials for various spin fields here for completeness . in the following calculations ,",
    "we need mainly the asymptotic behaviors of these potentials as @xmath27 , that is , near the black hole singularity .",
    "we assume that as @xmath27 , the asymptotic behavior of the effective potential is @xmath28 the values of @xmath29 for various spin fields are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have evaluated the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies for various spin fields in schwarzschild and reissner - norstrm black holes , using a combination of the monodromy method of motl and neitzke @xcite and the wkb formalism of andersson and howls @xcite .",
    "these frequencies are tabulated in table  [ table3 ] . in the schwarzschild case ,",
    "the real part of the asymptotic frequency for the spin 0 and the spin 2 fields is ln3 .",
    "this value has inspired a lot of interesting in its relation to the black hole area and entropy spectra @xcite .",
    "however , the real part of the frequency for the spin 1/2 , the spin 1 , and the spin 3/2 fields is zero .",
    "this result casts doubts on the universality of the value of ln3 , even for single - horizon black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "the imaginary parts of the frequencies all have spacings @xmath0 or @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the hawking temperature of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this value is thus universal for all the spin fields @xcite .",
    "our result for the imaginary part of the dirac quasinormal frequency agrees with @xcite and @xcite , but in contradiction with that of @xcite . in @xcite , the imaginary part of the frequency",
    "is calculated in two different ways , one analytical and the other numerical . for the analytical calculation ,",
    "the authors there follow the method of @xcite and @xcite in which the imaginary part is derived by identifying the locations of the poles of the scattering amplitude in the born approximation .",
    "this calculation is criticized in @xcite where it is shown that the method of @xcite and @xcite for the integral spin fields can not be extended directly to the dirac case .",
    "hence , the validity of the analytical calculation is in question . as for the numerical analysis ,",
    "the authors use the continued fraction method of leaver @xcite which converges much slower than the modified method of nollert @xcite .",
    "it seems that the method of nollert can not be applied to the effective potential of the dirac field .",
    "it is therefore possible that the correct answer has not been reached numerically there . in any case , the conclusion on the spacing of the imaginary part of the frequencies in @xcite is not at all reliable .    for the non - extreme reissner - nordstrm black holes , we find that the asymptotic frequency of the spin 3/2 rarita - schwinger field is the same as that of the spin 0 , the spin 1 , and the spin 2 fields which was first evaluated in @xcite .",
    "since this frequency involves both the mass @xmath3 and the charge @xmath33 of the black hole , it can not be expressed in a close form as that of the schwarzschild case @xcite .",
    "recently , hod @xcite had taken up this problem again .",
    "he obtained a value of ln2 for the real part of the frequency even in the reissner - nordstrm case by considering the quasinormal modes of a charged scalar field .",
    "it would be interesting to see if a universal value can be obtained for other spin fields by extending our calculation to charged field cases .",
    "the spin 1/2 dirac field is special in the reissner - nordstrm case .",
    "its asymptotic quasinormal frequency is different from the other spin fields .",
    "the real part is zero , as in the schwarzschild case .",
    "the imaginary part has a spacing of @xmath34 or @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the hawking temperature of the reissner - nordstrm black hole . in terms of the hawking temperature , this spacing has the same form as that for the schwarzschild black hole .    in the extremal case ,",
    "it is curious to see that all the spin fields have the same asymptotic frequency .",
    "since the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole is the simplest example of an supersymmetric black hole , one would expect the spin 1 , the spin 3/2 , and the spin 2 fields to have the same asymptotic frequency @xcite .",
    "however , it is quite unexpected for the scalar and the dirac fields to have the same value .",
    "the real part of this frequency is zero , while the imaginary part has again a spacing of @xmath0 .",
    "this spacing can not be expressed in terms of the hawking temperature which is zero in the extremal case , but it is the same as the spacing in the schwarzschild case . in this respect , it is the spacing of the imaginary part of the asymptotic frequencies that has a universal value of @xmath0 for all the single - horizon cases of the schwarzschild and the extreme reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "we can see from above that the universality of ln3 is indeed in question even for the single - horizon black holes .",
    "in addition , the relevancy of the asymptotic quasinormal frequency to the microstate description of the black hole entropy is not clear @xcite because this frequency depends crucially on the behavior of the effective potential near the black hole singularity as well as that near the event horizon . in spite of this",
    ", we still think that the black hole quasinormal spectrum should be important in the understanding of the quantum properties of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the quasinormal modes represent the characteristic oscillations of the black hole .",
    "if they are quantized in an appropriate way , which would involve the problem of how to quantize an open system , we should be able to obtain more information on the entropy of the quantum black hole @xcite .",
    "finally , it would be desirable to extend our consideration to the case of the kerr black hole in order to have a further understanding of the universality question of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies .",
    "up to now , the evaluations of the kerr asymptotic frequencies are mostly numerical ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because one has to deal with the asymptotic behaviors of the radial equation as well as the angular equation , which involves the spheroidal harmonics .",
    "recently there are a number of studies on the asymptotic behaviors of the spheroidal harmonics @xcite",
    ". hopefully one would soon be able to carry out a more complete study of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in the kerr black hole case .",
