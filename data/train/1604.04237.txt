    "among all the numerical methods that can be used to model acoustic wave propagation in the ocean ( see e.g. @xcite for a comprehensive review ) , finite - element techniques are methods of choice for solving the wave or helmholtz equation very accurately and for handling complex geometries@xcite .",
    "they have for instance been used to study acoustic scattering by rough interfaces@xcite , which is a topic of importance in reverberation studies and ocean bottom sensing , and for the study of diffraction by structures immersed or embedded within the oceanic medium@xcite .",
    "when time signals are needed they can be obtained by fourier synthesis from frequency - based simulations , or else obtained directly by solving the wave equation in the time domain . in this case ,",
    "spectral - element methods@xcite are of interest for performing numerical simulations because they lead to accurate results and an efficient implementation@xcite .",
    "in addition they are very well adapted to modern computing clusters@xcite and supercomputers .",
    "however , finite - element models have the drawback of requiring large computational resources compared to approximate numerical methods that do not solve the full - wave equation , for instance the parabolic approximation@xcite . despite the recent development of very efficient perfectly matched absorbing layers for the study of wave propagation in fluid - solid regions@xcite , which allows for a drastic reduction of the size of the computational domain ,",
    "performing realistic 3d simulations in ocean acoustics still turns out to be difficult because of the high computational cost incurred .",
    "the main reason for this lies in the size of the domains classically studied in ocean acoustics that often represent thousands of wavelengths .",
    "a first attempt was presented at low frequency in @xcite , but when higher frequencies are required in the context of full - wave simulations , 2d simulations are currently still the only option . in previous work@xcite on underwater acoustics , we used a 2d cartesian ( plane strain ) version of the spectral - element method .",
    "this type of 2d simulation has the disadvantage of involving line sources , i.e. unphysical sources that extend in the direction perpendicular to the 2d plane@xcite .",
    "physical effects are thus enhanced in an artificial manner and may lead to erroneous interpretation . for the same reason , comparisons with real data are difficult because amplitudes and waveforms are unrealistic .    a more realistic approach thus consists of resorting to axisymmetric simulations .",
    "if the source is situated on the symmetry axis then this allows for the calculation of wavefields having 3d geometrical spreading with the cost of a 2d simulation .",
    "nevertheless , solving the weak form of the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates leads to a difficulty because of the potential singularity in elements that are in contact with the symmetry axis , for which @xmath0 at some of their points and thus the factor @xmath1 becomes singular .",
    "several strategies have been proposed to overcome this difficulty .",
    "one approach consists of increasing the accuracy of the numerical integration when an element is close to the axis or lies on the axis and slightly shifting its position away from the axis@xcite .",
    "however , in such a case the source can not be put on the axis , making simulations of point sources impossible .",
    "a better strategy was developed by @xcite , who proposed to use a gauss - radau - type quadrature rule to handle this problem and remove the singularity .",
    "this approach was successful and several subsequent articles have implemented axisymmetric simulations using this strategy to reduce the computational cost of spectral - element - based numerical simulations .",
    "for instance , @xcite used axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates to simulate thermal convection in fluid - filled containers , and nissen - meyer et al .",
    "@xcite used a clever combination of four runs performed in cylindrical coordinates to simplify the computations of seismic wavefields in spherical coordinates in both fluid - solid and purely solid regions .",
    "however , to our knowledge ocean acoustics configurations with axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates have never been addressed . in this article",
    "we thus present an axisymmetric spectral - element method in cylindrical coordinates for such fluid - solid models that is particularly well - adapted to underwater acoustics .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the implementation of an axisymmetric spectral - element method in cylindrical coordinates for fluid and solid regions .",
    "section iii is then devoted to the validation of this implementation by providing comparisons with results obtained with analytical or other numerical methods .",
    "we first consider a flat bottom configuration , and then analyze a slope bottom configuration that exhibits significant backscattering , illustrating the interest of performing full - wave time - domain simulations .",
    "finally , in section iv we illustrate the importance of taking backscattering into account in acoustic wave propagation in the ocean based on a configuration with two seamounts .",
    "this model exhibits strong backscattering effects that can only be modeled based on a full - wave simulation .",
    "in this section we will briefly present our axisymmetric spectral - element technique .",
    "interested readers can learn more on spectral element methods in their cartesian forms by referring to @xcite or @xcite for example .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the position vector . in the general case ,",
    "the time - dependent displacement field @xmath3 induced by an acoustic source @xmath4 is related to the medium features by the 3d wave equation , which can be written in its strong form as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distribution of density , @xmath7 is the divergence of the stress tensor @xmath8 , and a dot over a symbol denotes time differentiation . in a typical forward problem the source @xmath4 and",
    "the material properties of the medium are known and we are interested in computing the displacement field @xmath3 .    from now on we will choose the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath9 - see figure [ fig : cyl ] .",
    "the position vector is then expressed as @xmath10 and any vector @xmath11 is decomposed into its cylindrical components , @xmath12 at this point we choose the 2.5-d convention : we consider a 3d domain @xmath13 symmetric with respect to the axis @xmath14 and suppose that the important loads are axisymmetric also and are thus independent of @xmath15 .",
    "then , all the quantities of interest are independent of @xmath15 and , due to the rotational symmetry , the @xmath15-component of the displacement is zero .",
    "this yields true axisymmetry resulting in a reduction of the order and the number of equations , while still preserving the possibility of non - zero out - of - plane components of stress , @xmath16 .",
    "an example of such a configuration can be seen in figure [ fig : notations ] ( left ) .",
    "following curie s symmetry principle , the symmetry of a cause is always preserved in its effects .",
    "hence if the acoustic source @xmath17 does not depend on @xmath15 , working in the 3d domain @xmath13 reduces to working in its meridional 2d shape @xmath18 , referred to as the transect in underwater acoustics .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : notations ] ( right ) , in the general case , this 2d meridional shape @xmath18 is composed of a fluid part @xmath19 and a solid part @xmath20 .",
    "the coupling interface between these two sub - domains is denoted @xmath21 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath18 has a free surface @xmath22 , and fictitious absorbing boundaries @xmath23 .",
    "these are required because for regional simulations our modeling domain is limited by fictitious boundaries beyond which we are not interested in the wave field and thus acoustic energy reaching the edges of the model needs to be absorbed by our algorithm . in recent years",
    ", an efficient absorbing condition called the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) has been introduced@xcite and is now used widely in regional numerical simulations .",
    "although we have implemented them in our code , the mathematical and numerical complications associated with absorbing boundary conditions are beyond the scope of this article and will not be addressed here as their implementation in the axisymmetric case is very similar to the cartesian one .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for example .",
    "let us just mention that grazing incidence problems have been solved@xcite and these enhanced pml layers are implemented in our code .",
    "this allows us to perform simulations on very elongated domains . for the sake of completeness",
    "we will note @xmath24 all the possible one - dimensional boundaries considered , although we will focus on fluid - solid interfaces @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath25 we note @xmath26 the outward unit normal to the surfaces @xmath27 .",
    "the spectral - element method , just as the standard finite - element method , is based on a weak form of the wave equation .",
    "this formulation being different in the fluid and solid parts of the model we will present each case separately .",
    "it is worth mentioning that unified fluid - solid formulations can be designed if needed@xcite , however they lead to a larger number of calculations on the fluid side .      in the fluid regions , and ignoring the source term for now , the wave equation when written for pressure @xmath28 in a spatially - heterogeneous fluid is@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the adiabatic bulk modulus of the fluid .",
    "the linearized euler equation is valid in a fluid with constant or spatially slowly - varying density@xcite and reads @xmath31 following @xcite and then @xcite , from a numerical point of view it is more convenient to integrate this system twice in time because that allows for numerical fluid - solid coupling based on a non - iterative scheme .",
    "we thus define a new scalar potential , @xmath32 and the scalar wave equation ( [ eqforpressure ] ) then becomes @xmath33 equation ( [ eulereq ] ) combined with ( [ definepotential ] ) leads to @xmath34 i.e. @xmath35 is irrotational@xcite .",
    "adding a pressure point - source at position @xmath36 we obtain the wave equation in fluids , @xmath37 let @xmath38 be a real - valued , arbitrary test function defined on @xmath19 .",
    "one obtains the weak form by dotting the wave equation with a scalar test function @xmath39 and integrating by parts over the model volume @xmath19 , @xmath40 note that the infinitesimal surface is now @xmath41 .",
    "remark that the part of the contour integral along the free surface @xmath22 has vanished .",
    "indeed , the pressure - free surface condition is @xmath42 for all times and all @xmath43 , and thus @xmath44 as well , hence @xmath45 , making the contour integral along the free surface @xmath22 vanish naturally .",
    "the first term of is traditionally called the mass integral , the second is the stiffness integral and the third is the fluid - solid coupling integral .",
    "the last term is the ( known ) source term , and will be dropped for notational convenience .",
    "it should be noted that both the test function @xmath46 and the radial derivative of the potential @xmath47 have to vanish on the axis@xcite .",
    "let us now present the discretization of this equation based on the time - domain spectral - element method .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the 2d planar spectral - element implementation ( of e.g. @xcite ) , thus for the sake of conciseness we detail here the differences only .",
    "we recall that the model @xmath18 is subdivided into a number of non - overlapping quadrangular elements @xmath48 , @xmath49 , such that @xmath50 . as a result of this subdivision , the boundary @xmath27 is similarly represented by a number of 1d edges @xmath51 , @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 2d elements that are in contact with the axis need to be distinguished , they will be noted @xmath55 .",
    "similarly we will note @xmath56 the 1d horizontal edges that are in contact with the axis by one point ( figure  [ fig : glpoints ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we also assume that the mesh elements that are in contact with the symmetry axis are in contact with it by a full edge rather than by a single point , i.e. we exclude cases such as that of figure  [ fig : meshrestrictionontheaxis ] .",
    "this amounts to imposing that the leftmost layer of elements in the mesh be structured rather than non structured , while the rest of the mesh can be non structured .",
    "the integrals in the weak form ( [ eq : weakform3dacoust ] ) are then split into integrals over the elements , in turn expressed as integrals over 2d and 1d reference elements @xmath57\\times[-1,1]$ ] and @xmath58 $ ] thanks to an invertible mapping between global coordinates @xmath59 and reference local coordinates @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the jacobian of the invertible mapping . it then remains to calculate these integrals . the spectral - element method is based upon a high - order piecewise polynomial approximation of the weak form of the wave equation . for non axial elements ,",
    "integrals along @xmath63 and @xmath64 are computed based upon gauss - lobatto - legendre ( gll ) quadrature .",
    "the integral of a function is expressed as a weighted sum of the values of the function at @xmath65 specified collocation points called gll points ( containing @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) as described in textbooks on the spectral - element method@xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 gll points along @xmath63 will be noted @xmath68 , and those along @xmath64 are noted @xmath69 , the integration weights associated are noted @xmath70 and the basis functions are @xmath71 or @xmath72 . in the axisymmetric case , following @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite we use a different quadrature for the integration in the @xmath63-direction for elements that are in contact with the symmetry axis .",
    "indeed one can see that the factor @xmath73 in the infinitesimal surface @xmath74 would lead to undetermined equations , @xmath75 , if the integrands were to be evaluated at @xmath76 . to deal with this issue",
    "the easiest solution would be to shift the edge of the mesh by a small distance away from the axis ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite ) but this convenient solution is not very meaningful for most physical problems because the source , not being on the axis , has to have a circular shape and thus an unphysical radiation pattern . @xcite introduced a convenient way to tackle this issue , which has now become the classical approach for axisymmetric spectral - element problems@xcite . in the @xmath64 direction ( the vertical direction )",
    "nothing different has to be done , but in the @xmath63 direction one resorts to gauss - lobatto - jacobi ( glj ) quadrature @xmath77 .",
    "one first defines the set of polynomials @xmath78 based on @xmath79-degree legendre polynomials @xmath80 following the relation , @xmath81 the @xmath82 glj points @xmath83 are then the @xmath82 zeros of @xmath84 , and one computes the glj basis functions@xcite @xmath85 , @xmath86 any function @xmath87 on @xmath88 can be decomposed on its values at the glj and gll points , @xmath89 where we have noted @xmath90 the value of @xmath91 at the glj / gll points @xmath92 .",
    "it is worth mentioning the important property @xmath93 as well as the fact that the points @xmath66 and @xmath67 still belong to the set of collocation points : the continuity with non - axial elements is thus ensured , and the mass matrix remains diagonal .",
    "we evaluate the surface integrals with the following quadrature rule , @xmath94 where the @xmath95 are the glj integration weights . as the glj points",
    ", they are computed easily once and for all .",
    "all functions @xmath91 considered in axial elements satisfy @xmath96 , consequently the singularities involving the terms @xmath97 are easily removed with lhpital s rule@xcite , @xmath98 the 1d integrals on horizontal edges of axial elements ( the only ones that are different from the cartesian formulation ) are computed in the same way , forgetting the variable @xmath64 . for any function @xmath99 on @xmath100 , @xmath101\\quad g(r(\\xi))\\approx\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{n}g(r(\\overline{\\xi}_{\\alpha}))\\overline{\\ell}_{\\alpha}(\\xi )        \\equiv \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{n}g^{\\overline{\\alpha}}\\:\\overline{\\ell}_{\\alpha}(\\xi)}\\ ] ] and @xmath102 after substituting these representations in the wave equation , a last step has to be performed to deal with gll / glj points lying on the sides , edges or corners of an element that are shared amongst neighboring elements ( see figure [ fig : glpoints ] ) .",
    "therefore , the grid points that define an element ( the local mesh ) and all the grid points in the model ( the global mesh ) need to be distinguished and mapped .",
    "efficient routines are available for this purpose from finite - element modeling .",
    "before the system can be marched forward in time , the contributions from all the elements that share a common global grid point need to be summed .",
    "in traditional finite - element this is referred to as the assembly of the system . for more details on the matrices involved and",
    "on the assembly of the system the reader can refer e.g. to the appendix of @xcite or to @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the relations must hold for any test function @xmath39 , one obtains a global algebraic system of equations , @xmath103 in which @xmath104 gathers the value of the potential and @xmath105 gathers all the interior forces at any unique gll / glj point .",
    "the term @xmath106 is the mass matrix . by construction in the spectral - element method",
    "this matrix is diagonal and its inversion is thus straightforward and does not incur any significant computational cost . hence time discretization of the second - order hyperbolic ordinary differential equation can be based upon a fully explicit time scheme . in practice",
    "we select an explicit second - order - accurate finite - difference scheme , which is a particular case of the newmark scheme@xcite .",
    "this scheme is conditionally stable , and the courant stability condition is governed by the maximum value of the ratio between the compressional wave speed and the grid spacing .",
    "the main numerical cost associated with the spectral - element method is related to small , local matrix - vector products between the local field and the local stiffness matrix , not to the time - integration scheme@xcite .      in linear",
    "elastic solids the strain tensor @xmath107 is calculated from the displacement vector @xmath108 by @xmath109 the stress tensor @xmath8 is then a linear combination of the components of the strain tensor ( hooke s law ) : @xmath110 where the colon denotes a double tensor contraction operation .",
    "the elastic properties of the medium are described by the fourth - order elastic tensor @xmath111 , which can have up to @xmath112 independent coefficients . in this article for simplicity",
    "we will consider isotropic media and put aside the more general anisotropic relationship .",
    "however anisotropy can readily be implemented ( see for instance @xcite ) . in elastic isotropic media",
    "the stress tensor field reads @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the @xmath115 identity tensor and @xmath116 is the trace of the strain tensor .",
    "the lam parameters of the medium are denoted by @xmath117 and @xmath118 they are related to the pressure wave speed @xmath119 , shear wave speed @xmath120 and density @xmath121 by the expressions @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "likewise we will avoid the numerical complications associated with attenuation ( viscoelasticity ) , however attenuation is implemented in our code@xcite and we will use it in the numerical validation tests and examples of section  [ sectionnumericalvalidation ] .",
    "let us just recall that in an anelastic medium the stress @xmath8 at time @xmath124 is determined by the entire strain history @xmath125 , and hooke s law becomes@xcite @xmath126    as in the fluid part , one obtains the weak form by dotting the wave equation with a test function @xmath127 and integrating by parts over the model volume @xmath18 .",
    "the only difference with the fluid formulation is that the test function is vectorial @xmath128 .",
    "one obtains , @xmath129 where @xmath130 the important difference with a 2d planar model is the presence of the `` hoop stress '' term , @xmath131 - see figure [ fig : cyl ] . here again",
    "the traction - free integral along the free surface @xmath22 has vanished naturally . for simplicity",
    "we have supposed that there is no source in the elastic part of the model .",
    "it has to be noted that the terms @xmath132 and @xmath133 appear and are problematic in axial elements for the glj point that is located exactly on the axis , i.e. at @xmath134 .",
    "however , on the axis , by symmetry considerations @xmath135 and , by definition of the test functions in axisymmetric domains@xcite , @xmath136 . thus lhpital s rule can be applied , as in the fluid case . for any @xmath91 , which can represent @xmath137 or @xmath138 in practice ,",
    "we define @xmath139 following similar steps as for the fluid part of the model , after assembling the system one obtains a similar global system of equations , @xmath140 where the @xmath141 gather all the values of the ( unknown ) displacement and the @xmath142 gather all the interior forces at every gll / glj point .",
    "we have tested the accuracy and efficiency of the technique and benchmarked it against reference solutions calculated with the wavenumber integration software package oases@xcite version 3.1 as well as with the commercial finite - element code comsol .",
    "the two examples include fluid - solid coupling , attenuation and pml absorbing layers ; they are extracted from @xcite and described in figure [ fig : settingsimulations ] .",
    "our code computes time - domain signals but the results are shown both in time and frequency domains as an illustration . for information , these examples ran in a few seconds ( 2  minutes maximum depending on the configuration chosen ) on 12 processor cores of an intel xeon@xmath143 e5 - 2630 multicore pc .",
    "let us first compare the results of our spectral - element technique with those from the oases wavenumber integration code for a flat - bottom benchmark case .",
    "we consider an axisymmetric half - space composed of a semi - infinite homogeneous viscoelastic medium lying 600 m below a homogeneous sea layer .",
    "the properties of the homogeneous viscoelastic part are given by @xmath144 kg.m@xmath145 for the density , @xmath146 m.s@xmath147 for the pressure wave speed , @xmath148 m.s@xmath147 for the shear wave speed and @xmath149 db/@xmath150 , @xmath151 db/@xmath152 the corresponding attenuation coefficients .",
    "in the acoustic domain we set the density to @xmath153 kg.m@xmath145 and the pressure wave speed to @xmath154 m.s@xmath147 .",
    "we set @xmath155 m at the fluid surface .",
    "the pressure source is located on the symmetry axis in the acoustic part of the medium , in @xmath156 = ( 0,-100 m ) ; its source time function is a ricker ( i.e. the second derivative of a gaussian ) wavelet with a dominant frequency @xmath157 hz and a time shift @xmath158 in order to ensure null initial conditions .",
    "the wavefield is computed up to a range of 12 km and down to depth 1800 m , the energy coming out of this box being absorbed by pmls .",

    "the pressure time series at 5 km and @xmath165 m , normalized to unit pressure at a distance of 1  m from the source , computed with oases and with the spectral - element method are shown in figure  [ fig : benchmark ] ( right ) and transmission losses in db at 5 hz and @xmath165 m are shown in figure  [ fig : benchmark ] ( left ) .",
    "the transmission losses for the spectral - element method have been obtained from the time signals by fourier transform .",
    "very good agreement is found between the two codes in both the time and frequency domains , thus validating our technique for this benchmark case .      in this section",
    "we examine the results of our spectral - element method for the upslope case ( slope @xmath167 7.1@xmath168 ) described in figure [ fig : settingsimulations ] .",

    "the properties of the media are the same as those used in the previous section .",
    "the source depth is 570 m in order to excite a significant interface wave of stoneley - scholte type , the shear wave speed being lower than the speed in water .",

    "the pressure is recorded at @xmath165 m by 1000 receivers uniformly distributed between @xmath171 m and @xmath166 km and by a horizontal antenna containing nine receivers ( the squares at depth 250 m in figure [ fig : settingsimulations ] ) .",
    "the transmission losses in db at 5 hz and @xmath165 m computed with comsol , rotvars and with the spectral - element method are shown in figure [ fig : comsol ] ( left ) .",
    "an almost perfect fit is found between comsol and the spectral - element method , even if the first is implemented in the frequency domain while the second is in the time domain .",
    "all complex physical phenomena , including stoneley - scholte waves , are correctly modeled .",
    "however the parabolic code rotvars does not line up because the slope bottom causes non negligible back - propagating waves that are not taken into account by parabolic equation methods .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : comsol ] ( right ) showing the pressure time series recorded by the horizontal antenna .",
    "this explains the differences already pointed out in @xcite and illustrates the advantage of going beyond the parabolic solution for these kinds of problems .",
    "in this section we present an example of a more realistic application to illustrate the possibilities offered by full - wave simulations .",
    "the objective is to observe the wavefield behavior at long range created by an explosive source in an ocean with ocean - floor topography .",
    "the model is described in figure [ fig : snapshots ] . performing a 2d axisymmetric simulation",
    "is very interesting for such cases with moderate azimuthal aperture@xcite because , since the source emits far from the seamounts , later effects are negligible and thus the results will be almost the same as those of a fully 3d calculation , whose cost would still be prohibitive even on current large supercomputers due to the high frequencies and large propagation distances involved ( and will remain so for at least a decade or so , as shown by the extrapolation of supercomputer power evolution that can be made for instance based on the data available in the top500 database@xcite ) .",

    "we consider two spatial windows , one covering a region close to the source in which the sea floor is flat and another one that includes both seamounts . for each region we present snapshots of the wavefield at different times .",

    "the snapshot at time @xmath176  s shows the direct and reflected wavefronts very close to one another because of the proximity of the source to the water - sediment interface , as well as a transmitted wavefront propagating into the sediment . in the snapshot at time @xmath177  s the reflected and direct wavefronts have reached the water - air interface , considered as a free surface in the simulation . a small wave packet that propagates along the interface , now separated from the two other wavefronts and that corresponds to a surface wave of stoneley - scholte type , can be observed .",
    "it can be identified because it propagates at a speed that is slower than all the wave speeds of the two media in contact ( @xmath178 m.s@xmath147 ) .",
    "the second spatial window covers a region starting at range 1.8 km and ending at range 3.4 km .",
    "the snapshot at time @xmath179  s exhibits a wavefront propagating in the sediment ( associated to the pressure wave ) reaching the position of the second seamount while the wavefront propagating in the water reaches the position of the first seamount .",

    "s the influence of the two seamounts starts to affect wave propagation in the waveguide .",
    "a triplication can be observed in the upper - left part of the snapshot owing to the shape of the first seamount . in the sediment , two wavefronts can be observed .",
    "the first is associated to the first reflected wavefront from the water - air interface transmitted into the sediment while the second comes from a transmission occurring at the first seamount because of the curvature change .",
    "the same type of transmission into the sediment through the second seamount is beginning and can be seen half way to the top . some energy starts to penetrate into the sediment .",
    "this process continues and can be seen after the top of the second seamount at time @xmath181  s. two wavefronts above the first seamount correspond to the beginning of the significant backscattering that occurs in this configuration . at time @xmath182  s multiple reflections generated between the water - air interface and the two seamounts interact and lead to a complex wavefield structure .",
    "these multiple reflections are clearly seen at the top of the second seamount together with the interface wave that was generated at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "strong backscattering is observed .    for information",
    ", this example ran on 180 processor cores of a computing cluster in @xmath183 minutes and could have run on a current classical high - end pc in less than a night .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the spectral - element method exhibits almost perfect computing scaling i.e. almost perfect parallel efficiency on modern parallel computers@xcite when increasing the number of processors used ( mostly because its mass matrix is diagonal and thus no linear system needs to be inverted ) .    in terms of limitations of the approach",
    "let us mention again that the model being axisymmetric , calculations are made for seamounts whose 3d shape is annular .",
    "this has to be kept in mind for axisymmetric simulations in particular when dealing with backscattered energy for objects located close to the symmetry axis because for this geometrical reason backscattered energy gradually grows when coming closer to that axis and is then reflected back into the model after having reached it ; this comes from the fact that the radial component of displacement is zero by symmetry on the symmetry axis and thus acts as a dirichlet condition ( perfectly reflecting condition ) for the radial component of the field .",
    "this is unphysical and constitutes a model error .",
    "a way of avoiding such fictitious ` backscattering of the backscattering ' by the axis could maybe be to adopt a quasi - cylindrical formulation@xcite .",
    "another limitation of the approach is the type of sources that can be modeled if the source is located in the solid part of the model .",
    "since explosive sources have an axisymmetric shape they are perfectly modeled , whether they are located in the fluid or in the solid , which allows for the study a large number of physical problems ; however point force sources or moment tensor sources in solids@xcite are limited to cases in which they have an axisymmetric radiation pattern .",
    "we have presented and validated a numerical method based on time - domain spectral elements for coupled fluid - solid full - wave propagation problems in an axisymmetric setting , including in cases with significant backscattering , which can not be modeled e.g. based on the parabolic equation approximation .",
    "our calculations have included viscoelastic ocean bottoms , and we have used pml absorbing layers to efficiently absorb the outgoing wavefield . an advantage of this method is its versatility and its relatively low computational cost compared to a truly 3d calculation while allowing simulations with realistic 3d geometrical spreading .",
    "an application to the calculation of the full wavefield at long range created by a high - frequency explosive source in an ocean with sea - floor topography has also been presented .",
    "various future application domains are contemplated , among which we can cite more precise studies of seamounts as well as the study of ocean t - wave dynamics@xcite . our specfem spectral - element software package , which implements the spectral - element method presented above , is collaborative and available as open source from the computational infrastructure for geodynamics ( cig ) ; it includes all the tools necessary to reproduce the results presented in this article .",
