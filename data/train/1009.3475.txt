    "the x - ray luminosities of the unresolved emission ( @xmath28 ) and resolved supersoft sources ( @xmath29 ) are presented in the first columns of table [ tab : lxlk ] . with the exception of m81 , resolved supersoft sources",
    "contribute less than about @xmath30 to the total luminosity in the @xmath1 kev band .",
    "for m81 , the two luminosities are nearly equal .",
    "its case will be further discussed below , but we also note here that the luminosity of resolved supersoft sources in this galaxy is dominated by one very bright source with @xmath1 kev luminosity of @xmath31",
    ".      further columns of table [ tab : lxlk ] present @xmath14 ratios for galaxies and their different structural components .",
    "the average @xmath16 ratios range from @xmath32 .",
    "its lowest value is observed in m81 . due to its large angular extent ,",
    "the disk of this galaxy was mostly outside the chandra field of view .",
    "this may explain , at least in part , the smaller value of the @xmath16 ratio . the other end of the range is represented by the irregular galaxy ngc4449 .    despite larger intrinsic absorption ,",
    "the @xmath0 ratios exceed by factor of about @xmath33 those of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is further illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : lklx ] where x - ray luminosities are plotted against k - band luminosities .",
    "the early - type galaxy sample is taken from @xcite .",
    "although the contribution of bright resolved supersoft sources is included , it does not exceed @xmath34 ( table [ tab : lxlk ] ) .",
    "therefore this plot shows , essentially , the luminosity of unresolved emission . as in the case of early - type galaxies",
    "the contribution of unresolved x - ray binaries may be of some importance , we used x - ray luminosities transformed to the uniform source detection sensitivity of @xmath35 .",
    "the straight lines show the emissivity of faint compact sources in the solar neighborhood from @xcite , including ( solid ) and excluding ( dashed ) the contribution of young stars . to convert their @xmath0 ratio from the @xmath36 kev to the @xmath1 kev band we assumed @xmath37 and an optically - thin thermal plasma emission model ( mekal ) with @xmath38 kev ; if a @xmath39 power - law is assumed , the lines move downwards by a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "the agreement of soft x - ray luminosity of gas - poor early type galaxies with the old population of the solar neighborhood is remarkable ( we note that due to small investigated volume , the latter does not include any supersoft sources , however , as mentioned above , their contribution in the soft luminosity of early - type galaxies does not exceed @xmath41 ) .",
    "late - type galaxies , on the other hand , lie , with a large scatter , significantly above the line , corresponding to the solar neighborhood .",
    "this is explained by contribution of the hot ionized ism .    to further investigate spiral galaxies we measured @xmath14 ratios for their bulges and disks .",
    "the separation was made based on near - infrared images .",
    "we did not find very large difference ",
    "the @xmath14 ratios typically do not differ by more than a factor of @xmath40 , except for m74 where the disk value is larger by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "there is a number of factors which may affect @xmath14 ratios : the younger stellar population of the disk will tend to have higher @xmath0 , whereas the more centrally concentrated hot x - ray emitting gas and the lower intrinsic absorption will increase its value in the bulge .",
    "combination of these  and possibly other ",
    "effects may be responsible for observed scatter in @xmath0 values .",
    "four galaxies in our sample ( m51 , m74 , m81 , and m83 ) have grand design spiral arms allowing us to measure @xmath0 ratios of spiral arms and interarm regions separately , obtained values are given in table [ tab : lxlk ] .",
    "the arm and interarm regions were separated based on optical and near - infrared images . to our surprise",
    ", we did not find large difference between spirals arms and interarm regions , their @xmath0 ratios being different by no more than @xmath43 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath16 ratios in spiral arms are not suppressed by the significantly higher intrinsic absorption may suggest that supersoft sources do not contribute significantly to the soft x - ray emission form the disks of spiral galaxies , but x - ray sources with harder spectrum dominate .",
    "the most likely candidate for such sources is the emission from ism ( fig .",
    "[ fig : enspec ] ) .",
    "we also compared the numbers of resolved supersoft sources detected in bulges and disks and in spiral arms and in interarm regions . due to their small number in each particular galaxy",
    ", we combined data for all nine spiral galaxies . counting only sources with @xmath44 we found that @xmath45 of them are located in bulges and @xmath46 in disks . taking into account the combined k - band luminosity of bulges ( @xmath47 ) and disks ( @xmath48 ) we derived the specific frequency of the supersoft sources of @xmath49 in bulges and @xmath50 per @xmath51 in disks of spiral galaxies . as expected , but probably never confirmed quantitatively before , the specific frequency of supersoft sources in disks exceeds by factor of about @xmath52 that of bulges .    for four grand design spiral galaxies we performed a similar investigation comparing spiral arms and interarm regions .",
    "there were @xmath53 sources in spiral arms and @xmath54 in interarm regions , whose k - band luminosities were @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the specific frequencies of supersoft sources are close to each other : @xmath57 and @xmath58 per @xmath51 , respectively .    as a caveat we note that in calculating statistics of resolved supersoft sources we combined the data for different galaxies having different sensitivity limits ( table 1 ) . in order to reduce this effect we counted only sources with @xmath44",
    ", however we made no attempt to perform an accurate incompleteness correction .",
    "this may affect somewhat the particular specific frequency values but would not change results of the comparison of different structural components of galaxies .",
    "the observed @xmath14 ratios allow us to constrain the role of supersoft sources as progenitors of sne ia .",
    "although unlike the case of early - type galaxies , in late - type galaxies these constraints do not translate into global upper limits on the single degenerate scenario , they are important for understanding relative roles of different evolutionary channels .",
    "we therefore compare observed @xmath14 ratios with the ones predicted in the single degenerate scenario .    in computing the predicted values we assumed that entire process of the mass accumulation by the white dwarfs proceeds in the regime with the nominal x - ray radiation efficiency , i.e. that the accreted material has solar composition and the photospheric radius of the nuclear burning hydrogen shell is close to the white dwarf radius .",
    "particular calculations were conducted using approach and parameters of @xcite , namely the initial white dwarf mass of @xmath59 and an accretion rate of @xmath60 .",
    "the sn ia rate was assumed to be proportional to the k - band luminosity with the scale according to @xcite : @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the bulges and the disks of spiral galaxies and @xmath63 for irregular galaxies .      in comparing predicted luminosities with observations",
    "it is important to take into account strong and spatially varying absorption commonly present in late - type galaxies . in order to accomplish this",
    "we divided galaxies in sufficiently small cells . in choosing the cell size we required that each contained at least @xmath64 x - ray counts in the @xmath65 kev band , necessary for the spatially",
    "resolved analysis described below .",
    "thus , the number of cells per galaxy depends on their surface brightness and chandra exposure time and varied from @xmath66 in case of ngc3077 to 1065 for m101 .",
    "the typical k - band luminosity within one cell was in the @xmath67 range and size was between @xmath68 .",
    "in each cell the supernova rate was computed from its k - band luminosity and the x - ray luminosity of nuclear burning white dwarfs was computed and absorption ( intrinsic , determined for each cell from hi maps , and galactic ) was applied .",
    "the luminosities of all cells in a galaxy were summed and divided by its k - band luminosity to give the average predicted @xmath14 ratio . the so computed values are presented in the last column of table 2 . by the method of calculation",
    "they present galactic average and are to be compared with observed values listed in the column ( 4 ) , marked @xmath69 .",
    "table [ tab : lxlk ] shows that for majority of galaxies predicted @xmath14 ratios exceed observed values by a factor of @xmath70 . for these galaxies we can place upper limits of @xmath71 on the contribution of supersoft sources to the sn ia rate . for few galaxies , m94 , ngc 2403 and ngc3077 ,",
    "the difference is @xmath40 times . in the case of ngc4449",
    "predicted x - ray luminosity is @xmath40 times smaller than the observed value .",
    "for these galaxies no meaningful upper limits can be placed .",
    "we note that the latter galaxy has largest @xmath72 and @xmath14 ratio .",
    "it is further discussed in the sect .",
    "[ sec : nhsfr ] .      using the results of this calculation",
    "it is also possible to compare prediction of the model with observation in a more detailed , spatially resolved manner , computing the ratio of the observed luminosity to the predicted value in each individual cell . to present results of this analysis we plot in the fig .",
    "[ fig : snfraction ] the fraction of k - band luminosity of the galaxy contained in the cells , in which the ratio of observed to predicted x - ray luminosity is smaller than a given value .",
    "the meaning of this plot is that it shows the fraction of the stellar mass of the galaxy where the contribution of the supersoft sources to the type ia supernova rate is smaller than the given value .",
    "the plot reveals a large variations between galaxies in our sample . in several of them , m74 , m81 , m95 and ngc3184",
    ", supersoft sources can not contribute more than @xmath73 to the type ia supernova rate in more than @xmath74 of their mass .",
    "the other end of the range is represented by ngc2403 and ngc4449 , in which supersoft sources could , in principle , be progenitors of a large fraction of type ia supernovae without contradicting x - ray observations .",
    "we applied similar approach to analyze spiral arms and interarm regions in the four grand design spiral galaxies . in computing the sn ia rates",
    "we note that scale factors from @xcite refer to entire galaxies , therefore it may be inaccurate to use them in the analysis of arm and interarm regions . instead , we use results of @xcite who decomposed the sn ia rate into a mass related and a star - formation related components .",
    "namely , we assumed scale factors of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the stellar mass in cells was determined from their k - band luminosity assuming a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath77 .",
    "the star - formation rate was computed based on _ spitzer _ far - infrared images as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : infrared ] .",
    "the resulting upper limits are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : snfraction_arm ] using the same approach as in fig .",
    "[ fig : snfraction ] .",
    "the plot shows that upper limits for interarm regions are generally tighter than for the disks as a whole .",
    "overall , in more than @xmath78 of mass the contribution of supersoft sources to the sn ia rate is less than @xmath79 . in the spiral arms , on the contrary",
    ", no constraining upper limits can be obtained in three out of four galaxies  the supersoft sources can , in principle , be progenitors of a large fraction of sn ia .    a number of studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that sne ia originate from two sub - populations , often designated as prompt and delayed populations .",
    "the prompt population is believed to dominate at ages @xmath80 years , therefore this component is presumably associated with star - forming regions of galaxies , whereas the delayed population is producing sne ia in older stellar populations .",
    "according to the results of our spatially resolved analysis we find that a model , in which the major fraction of the prompt population originates from supersoft sources , does not contradict our x - ray data .",
    "the obtained upper limits vary significantly between galaxies , from a few per cent level to unconstraining values of tens of per cent .",
    "one may ask a question , whether these variations are a result of different levels of contamination and absorption in different galaxies or do indeed reflect varying contribution of supersoft sources . in an attempt to answer this question we plot in fig . [",
    "fig : lxr1 ] the ratio of the observed x - ray luminosity to the luminosity of supersoft sources predicted in the single degenerate scenario , @xmath81 , versus the @xmath82 value and @xmath14 ratio .",
    "the predicted luminosity was computed by the method described earlier in this section .",
    "the plots show clear correlations  the observed - to - predicted luminosity ratio increases with the column density and with specific luminosity of unresolved x - ray emission .",
    "this may indicate that variations in the upper limits are caused by variations in absorption and in the level of contamination .    on the other hand , in a picture , which is not entirely implausible ,",
    "the role of supersoft sources as sn ia progenitors may increase in star - forming galaxies .",
    "therefore one may expect a positive correlation of the luminosity of supersoft sources with the star - formation rate . to investigate this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : lxr2 ] the observed - to - predicted luminosity ratio versus specific star - formation rate .",
    "the plot does show some evidence of such a correlation , in an apparent contradiction to the tentative conclusion made above .",
    "it should be taken into account however , that star - forming galaxies tend to have larger @xmath82 and brighter levels of the diffuse emission , which may produce secondary correlations .",
    "the aim of this study was to measure soft band @xmath14 ratios in late - type galaxies .",
    "although these ratios are of interest on their own , our primary goal was to derive constraints on x - ray emission from nuclear burning white dwarfs and to constrain the role of supersoft sources as progenitors of sne ia . to this end we used an extensive set of archival _ chandra _ observations of a sample of twelve late - type galaxies , which included nine spiral and three irregular galaxies . in selecting our sample we demanded a source detection sensitivity of at least @xmath83 allowing the removal of bright x - ray binaries .",
    "we also required the existence of publicly available hi maps in order to measure the intrinsic absorption .",
    "the observed @xmath1 kev band @xmath0 ratios range from @xmath84 to @xmath85 , significantly exceeding those in early - type galaxies . based on the spectral analysis",
    "we tentatively suggest that the primary reason for this difference is the soft x - ray emission from hot ionized ism with the temperature of @xmath86 kev .",
    "x - ray emission from young stars in star - forming regions may also contribute . on a more detailed level",
    "we determine @xmath14 ratios for bulges and disks of spiral galaxies separately and for majority of them found a factor of @xmath87 difference .",
    "surprisingly , the sign of this difference was different in different galaxies , indicating the complexity of distribution of various x - ray emitting components in spiral galaxies . furthermore , in four grand design spiral galaxies we separated spiral arms and interarm regions and found that their @xmath0 ratios do not differ by more than @xmath43 .",
    "we investigated the role of supersoft sources as progenitors of sne ia .",
    "as a measure of their contribution we calculated the ratio of the observed soft x - ray luminosity to the luminosity predicted by the single degenerate scenario .",
    "the latter was computed assuming the nominal x - ray radiation efficiency of nuclear burning white dwarfs , as expected in the standard picture of supersoft sources @xcite .",
    "we find that for majority of galaxies the predicted luminosity exceeds observed values by a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "taken at the face value , these numbers imply upper limit of @xmath71 on the contribution of supersoft sources to the sn ia rate .",
    "for a few galaxies observed and predicted luminosities are comparable , therefore no constraining upper limits can be placed , including ngc4449 , where predicted luminosity is smaller than the observed one .",
    "the spatially resolved analysis yielded similar results .",
    "correlations of the upper limits with @xmath82 and @xmath14 ratios suggest that large scatter in upper limit may be a result of different level of contamination and absorption in different galaxies .",
    "it is important to realize that for the late - type galaxies , upper limits on the contribution of supersoft sources to sn ia rate do not translate into upper limits on the single degenerate scenario in general . in young stellar environment",
    "several possibilities may exist , that x - ray emission emission from nuclear burning white dwarfs is significantly suppressed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that these possibilities are are not expected to play significant role in early - type galaxies considered in @xcite , due to the old age of their stellar populations .    finally , we investigated the specific frequency of bright supersoft sources in bulges and disks of spiral galaxies and found significant difference , the supersoft sources being factor of @xmath40 times more frequent ( per unit k - band luminosity ) in the disks than in the bulges .",
