    "many suspension bridges manifested aerodynamic instability and uncontrolled oscillations leading to collapses , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these accidents are due to several different causes and the focus of this paper is to analyse those due to wide torsional oscillations . thanks to the videos available on the web @xcite , many people have seen the spectacular collapse of the tacoma narrows bridge ( tnb ) occurred in 1940 .",
    "the torsional oscillations were considered the main cause of the collapse @xcite .",
    "but the appearance of torsional oscillations is not an isolated event occurred only at the tnb : among others , we mention the collapse of the brighton chain pier in 1836 , the collapse of the wheeling suspension bridge in 1854 , the collapse of the matukituki suspension footbridge in 1977 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed description of these collapses .",
    "these accidents raised some fundamental questions of deep interest for both engineers and mathematicians . due to the vortex shedding ,",
    "longitudinal oscillations are to be expected in suspension bridges , but the reason of the sudden transition from longitudinal to torsional oscillations is less clear .",
    "so far , no unanimously accepted response to this question has been found .",
    "most attempts of explanations are based on aeroelastic effects such as the frequency of the vortex shedding , parametric resonance , and flutter theory .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that the origin of the torsional instability is purely structural .",
    "von krmn , a member of the board appointed for the report @xcite , was convinced that the torsional motion seen on the day of the collapse was due to the vortex shedding that amplified the already present torsional oscillations and caused the center span to violent twist until the collapse , see @xcite . but scanlan @xcite proved that the frequency of the torsional mode had nothing to do with the natural frequency of the shed vortices following the von krmn vortex pattern : the calculated frequency of a vortex caused by a 68 km / h wind is 1 hz , whereas the frequency of the torsional oscillations measured by farquharson ( an engineer witness of the tnb collapse , the man escaping in the video @xcite ) was 0.2 hz , see @xcite .",
    "the conclusion in @xcite is that the vortex trail is a consequence , not a primary cause of the torsional oscillation .",
    "also green - unruh ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath0 iii ) believe that vortices form independently of the motion and are not responsible for the catastrophic oscillations of the tnb .",
    "the vortex theory was later rediscussed by larsen @xcite , who stated that vortices may only cause limited torsional oscillations , but can not be held responsible for divergent large - amplitude torsional oscillations .",
    "recently , mckenna @xcite noticed that the behavior described in larsen s paper was never observed at the tacoma bridge and also green - unruh @xcite believe that _ the larsen model does not adequately explain data or simulations at around 23m / s_.    bleich @xcite suggested a possible connection between the instability in suspension bridges and the flutter speed of aircraft wings ; but billah - scanlan @xcite believe that it is a great mistake to relate these two phenomena .",
    "billah - scanlan also claim that their own work proves that the failure of the tnb was in fact related to an aerodynamically induced condition of self - excitation in a torsional degree of freedom ; but larsen @xcite believes that the work in @xcite fails to connect the vortex pattern to the switch of damping from positive to negative .",
    "moreover , mckenna @xcite states that @xcite _ is a perfectly good explanation of something that was never observed , namely small torsional oscillations , and no explanation of what really occurred , namely large vertical oscillations followed by torsional oscillations_.    the parametric resonance method was adapted to a tnb model by pittel - yakubovich @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter vi ) for the english translation and a more general setting .",
    "the conclusion on @xcite claims that _ the most dangerous phenomenon for the stability of suspension bridges is a combination of parametric resonance_. but scanlan @xcite comments these attempts by writing that _",
    "others have added to the confusion . a recent mathematics text @xcite , for example",
    ", seeking an application for a developed theory of parametric resonance , attempts to explain the tacoma narrows failure through this phenomenon_. we refer to @xcite for connections between ( aerodynamic ) parametric resonance , flutter theory , and self - oscillations , also applied to suspension bridges .    to conclude this quick survey of attempts for aeroelastic explanations",
    ", we mention that scanlan @xcite writes that _ ... the original tacoma narrows bridge withstood random buffeting for some hours with relatively little harm until some fortuitous condition `` broke '' the bridge action over into its low antisymmetrical torsion flutter mode _ ; the words _ fortuitous condition _ tell us that no satisfactory aeroelastic explanation is available . due to all these controversial discussions , mckenna (",
    "* @xmath0 2.3 ) writes that _ there is no consensus on what caused the sudden change to torsional motion _ , whereas scott @xcite writes that _ opinion on the exact cause of the tacoma narrows bridge collapse is even today not unanimously shared_. summarizing , all the attempts to find a purely aeroelastic explanation of the tnb collapse fail either because the quantitative parameters do not fit the theoretical explanations or because the experiments in wind tunnels do not confirm the underlying theory .    nowadays",
    "the attention has turned to the nonlinear behavior of structures @xcite . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we gave an explanation in terms of a _ structural instability _ : we considered an isolated nonlinear bridge model and we were able to show that , if the longitudinal oscillations are sufficiently small , then they are stable whereas if they are larger they can instantaneously switch to destructive torsional oscillations . the main tool used there are transfer maps ( poincar maps ) , which highlight an instability when the characteristic multipliers exit the complex unit circle .",
    "the same phenomenon was later emphasized for different models using the instability for the hill equation , see @xcite , which can also be explained by the floquet theory .",
    "all these results were obtained by considering isolated systems , that is , by neglecting both the aerodynamic forces and the dissipation . the idea to consider an isolated system",
    "was already suggested by irvine @xcite for a suspension bridge model similar to the one considered in @xcite : irvine ignores damping of both structural and aerodynamic origin , his purpose being to simplify as much as possible the model by maintaining its essence , that is , the conceptual design of bridges . and",
    "since our purpose is precisely to highlight the role of the structure on the stability , we follow this suggestion : in the conclusions of the present paper we mention how the aerodynamic effects combine with the structural effects .    in this paper",
    "we improve the results in @xcite by introducing a more precise model which also takes into account the nonlinear restoring action of the cables+hangers system on the deck ; the model is described in detail in section [ cabbeam ] and is the nonlinear version of a linear model that we introduced in @xcite . in section [ nlm ]",
    "we define the nonlinear longitudinal modes , that is , the periodic purely longitudinal motions of the deck which may be unstable and create torsional motions . in sections [ theores ] and [ nu22 ]",
    "we describe the theoretical framework that we use to study the stability of the longitudinal modes and we prove that they are stable for small energies .",
    "finally , we validate our theory by performing numerical simulations of the model with the parameters of the collapsed tnb .",
    "we study the existence and the behavior of approximate longitudinal modes and we compute their instability thresholds .",
    "our numerical results confirm that the longitudinal oscillations with 8 or 9 nodes and amplitudes of about 4 m , namely the oscillations observed the day of the collapse , are prone to generate torsional oscillations , see section [ numstab ] .",
    "the main conclusions and our explanation of the tnb collapse are collected in section [ conclu ] .",
    "throughout this paper the variable @xmath1 indicates the position along the deck and we denote the space and time derivatives as follows : @xmath2 and similarly for higher order derivatives .",
    "the physical constants are listed in section [ constants ] .    in a suspension",
    "bridge four towers sustain two cables that , in turn , sustain the hangers . at their lower endpoint",
    "the hangers are linked to the deck and sustain it from above .",
    "the hangers are hooked to the cables and the deck is hooked to the hangers . in this section",
    "we quickly revisit the bridge model that we recently introduced in @xcite : the displacements involved were assumed to be small , which justifies the asymptotic expansion of the energies . here",
    "we refine this model by considering more terms : this raises several nonlinearities in the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "moreover , we neglect the flexibility of the hangers : this will be justified below . as usual in engineering literature , we assume that positive displacements of the deck and the cables are oriented downwards and the origin is at the level of the deck at rest .",
    "we assume that the deck has length @xmath3 and width @xmath4 with @xmath5 ; we model it as a degenerate plate consisting of a beam representing the midline and cross sections which can rotate around the beam .",
    "the beam contains the barycenters of the cross sections and we denote its position with @xmath6 .",
    "the angle of rotation of the cross sections with respect to the horizontal position is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "then the positions of the free edges of the deck are given by @xmath8 since we aim to study what happens in a small torsional regime .",
    "we emphasise that our results do not aim to describe the behavior of the bridge when the torsional angle becomes large ; instead , we explain how a small torsional angle can suddenly increase , that is , our purpose is to describe the mechanism that triggers torsional oscillations .",
    "since the spacing between hangers is small relative to the span , the hangers can be considered as a continuous membrane connecting the cables and the deck .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the position of the cables at rest , @xmath10 being the level of the left and right endpoints of the cables ( @xmath11 is the height of the towers ) ; @xmath3 is the distance between the towers .",
    "if a beam of length @xmath3 and linear density of mass @xmath12 is hanged to a cable whose linear density of mass is @xmath13 , and if @xmath14 denotes the gravitational constant , then the cable at rest is subject to a downwards vertical force density given by @xmath15 .",
    "each free side of the deck is connected with hangers to a cable so that each cable sustains the weight of half deck ; then , we obtain the following boundary value problem for @xmath16 :    h_0s(x)=(+m ) g , + s(0)=s(l)=s_0 .    it is not difficult to show that admits a unique solution which , moreover , is symmetric with respect to @xmath17 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) for the details . in order to simplify notations we set @xmath18 so that , @xmath19 represents the local length of the cable at rest .",
    "when the deck is mounted , the hangers are in tension and reach the length @xmath16 , where @xmath20 is the solution of ; if no additional load acts on the system , the equilibrium position of the deck is horizontal and the position of the cables at equilibrium ( deck mounted ) is @xmath9 for @xmath21 .",
    "the two sustaining cables are labeled with @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 denotes the displacement of the cable @xmath24 with respect to the rest position , then @xmath25 denotes the actual position of the cable .",
    "the flexibility of the hangers has a significant effect on the frequencies of the higher modes when the deck is very stiff , see @xcite .",
    "however , as far as lower modes and weakly stiffened bridges are involved , the elastic deformation of the hangers may be neglected , see again the results by luco - turmo @xcite .",
    "since we aim to model a very flexible deck as the tnb , we assume that the hangers are rigid , their action merely being to connect the deck to the cables .",
    "this assumption is justified by the fact that the action of the cables is the main cause of the nonlinearity of the restoring force , see bartoli - spinelli @xcite . moreover",
    ", the nonlinear contribution of the hangers is mainly due to their slackening but , as reported in @xcite , the slackening of the hangers occurred at the tnb only _",
    "after _ that the large torsional oscillations appeared .",
    "our purpose is to understand how negligible torsional oscillations of the deck suddenly become dangerous ones , that is , to describe what happens _ before _ the slackening starts .",
    "this is a further reason to consider rigid hangers .",
    "if we assume that the hangers have a fixed length , then @xmath26 and @xmath27 : for our convenience , in the next subsection we maintain the notation with the @xmath28 s while we replace them in the euler - lagrange equations - .",
    "the kinetic energy of the deck is the sum of the kinetic energy of the barycenter of the cross section and of the kinetic energy of the torsional angle .",
    "then the total kinetic energy of the bridge is @xmath29\\sr\\ , dx\\ , .\\ ] ]    the gravitational energies of the deck and the cables are , respectively , given by @xmath30    the elastic energy of the deck is composed by the bending energy of the beam and the torsional energy : @xmath31    the tension of each cable consists of two parts . the first part is the tension at rest @xmath32 .",
    "the amount of energy needed to deform each cable at rest under the tension @xmath33 in the infinitesimal interval @xmath34 $ ] from the original position @xmath9 to @xmath35 ( @xmath22 ) is the variation of length times the tension , that is @xmath36 ^ 2}-\\sqrt{1+s'(x)^2}\\big)\\ , dx\\,.\\ ] ] hence , using the asymptotic expansion -=-+++o((p_i)_x^3 ) and neglecting the higher order terms , the energy necessary to deform the whole cable is e_c(p_i)=_0^l e_c(x)dxh_0_0^l(-s(p_i)_x++)dx .",
    "the second part of the tension of each cable is the additional tension @xmath37 due to the increment of length @xmath38 of the cable ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this increment requires the energy e_tc(p_i)=(p_i)^2 . in view of the asymptotic expansion",
    ", we can approximate the increment @xmath38 of the length of the cable ( due to its displacement @xmath28 ) by @xmath39 ^ 2}\\,dx - l_c\\approx \\int_0^l\\left(\\frac{-s'(p_i)_x}{\\xi}+\\frac{(p_i)_x^2}{2\\xi^3}\\right)\\ , dx\\ , .\\ ] ] a third order expansion then gives @xmath40 therefore , we approximate with e_tc(p_i)=(_0^l ) ^2 -(_0^l ) ( _ 0^l ) .",

    "for long time the aerodynamic effects have been considered the only cause of the tnb collapse .",
    "but , as quickly surveyed in the introduction , no purely aerodynamic explanation is nowadays able to justify the origin of the torsional oscillation , which is the main culprit for the collapse . in this paper",
    "we suggest a new nonlinear model , which improves @xcite , and we focus our attention on the nonlinear structural behavior of suspension bridges . to this end",
    ", we follow a suggestion by irvine @xcite and we isolate the bridge from aerodynamic effects and dissipation .",

    "we explain how to find periodic longitudinal oscillations as solutions of a nonlinear system of odes : contrary to linear systems , the period depends on the energy and on the amplitude of the oscillation .    in section [ theores ] we describe the theoretical framework governing the structural instability of suspension bridges .",
    "our analysis is based on tools from the floquet theory and a sufficient condition for the stability at low energy is obtained in section [ nu22 ] .",
    "then , in section [ numstab ] , we put into the model the quantitative parameters of the collapsed tnb and we compute its thresholds of instability .",
    "the results are in line with the values observed on the day of the collapse and well fit the report @xcite .",
    "first , the computed critical amplitude of longitudinal oscillations is the same as in the video @xcite .",
    "second , our results explain why the tnb withstood larger longitudinal oscillations on low modes , but failed for smaller longitudinal oscillations on higher modes , see @xcite .",
    "our results show that the origin of torsional instability is structural .",
    "it is clear that , in absence of wind or external loads , the deck of a bridge remains still .",
    "on the other hand , when the wind hits a bluff body ( such as the deck of the tnb ) the flow is modified and goes around the body . behind the deck , or a `` hidden part '' of it , the flow creates vortices which are , in general , asymmetric .",
    "this asymmetry generates a forcing lift which starts the vertical oscillations of the deck . up to some minor details",
    ", this explanation is shared by the whole community and it has been studied with great precision in wind tunnel tests , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the vortices induced by the wind increase the internal energy of the structure and generate wide longitudinal oscillations which look periodic in time .",
    "this is the point where our analysis starts , that is when the longitudinal oscillations of the structure reach a periodic motion which is maintained in amplitude by a somehow perfect equilibrium between the input of energy from the wind and internal dissipation . throughout this paper",
    "we have seen that , in such situation , if the longitudinal oscillation is sufficiently large , then a structural instability appears : this is the onset of torsional oscillations . in order to obtain a more accurate description of the dynamics of suspension bridges",
