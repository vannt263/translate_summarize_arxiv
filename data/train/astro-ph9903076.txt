    "very low - frequency ( @xmath2 mhz ) recombination lines of carbon which arise from electronic transitions at high quantum number states ( @xmath3 ) are formed in a relatively cool ( t@xmath4100 k ) and partially ionized widespread component of the ism ( payne et al 1994 , erickson et al 1995 ) .",
    "these lines were first discovered by konovalenko and sodin ( 1980 ) and identified by blake et al ( 1980 ) . below @xmath5150 mhz ( @xmath6 ) , the lines are seen in absorption and they turnover to emission above @xmath5200 mhz ( payne et al 1989 ) .",
    "the width of the lines increase dramatically towards lower frequencies which is caused by pressure and radiation broadening . the turnover frequency and line - broadening are good indicators of physical conditions ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) in the line forming region .",
    "the occurrence of emission lines from cold clouds against the ` hot ' radiation from cas  a is direct evidence for stimulated emission ( payne et al 1989 ) .",
    "we report here new observations of these lines near 34.5 mhz and 325 mhz towards cas a , the galactic centre and a number of other directions in the galactic plane .",
    "observations at 34.5 mhz were made using the 1.4 km @xmath10 20 m ew arm of the t - shaped dipole array at gauribidanur near bangalore .",
    "the 530 m @xmath11 30 m ooty radio telescope was used for observations near 325 mhz . at 34.5 mhz , eight recombination line transitions ( @xmath12 ) were observed simultaneously with a velocity resolution of @xmath13 km s@xmath14 and the spectra were averaged .",
    "the telescope beam was @xmath15 . at 325 mhz ,",
    "four transitions ( @xmath16 ) were observed simultaneously with a velocity resolution of 1.8 km s@xmath14 and observations were made with two angular resolutions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "fig 1a shows the recombination line spectrum at 34.5 mhz towards cas  a with an effective integration time of @xmath5 400 hrs .",
    "the spectrum clearly shows the presence of broad wings expected from radiation and pressure broadening . a voigt profile fitted to the spectrum with a doppler width of 3.5 km s@xmath14 and a lorentzian width of 25.4 km s@xmath14 is superposed .",
    "fig 1a also shows an emission spectrum observed at 770 mhz using the 140 ft telescope in green bank ( kantharia et al 1998 ) .",
    "the differences in line shape and strength between the two frequencies are striking .",
    "the high frequency line is only doppler broadened and shows two components of the perseus arm in emission .",
    "the two components merge into a single feature at 34.5 mhz due to line broadening .",
    "fig 2 shows spectra observed towards the galactic centre and a few other positions in the galactic plane near 34.5 and 325 mhz .",
    "the lines were detected towards 9 directions in the inner galaxy .",
    "one significant difference in these spectra compared to fig 1a is that the line widths are similar at both frequencies .",
    "these line widths are also similar to those observed at 75 mhz by erickson et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "absence of line broadening at lower frequencies implies that radiation and pressure broadening are not significant .",
    "the line widths are however large at both frequencies ( 20 - 30 km s@xmath14 ) which is most likely due to differential galactic rotation .",
    "the phenomenon of turnover from absorption to emission is observed in all the cases .",
    "if the entire lorentzian width of 25.4 km s@xmath14 towards cas  a is attributed to radiation broadening , then we get an upper limit to the radiation temperature at 100 mhz , @xmath19 k. since the brightness temperature of cas  a at 100 mhz is @xmath20 k , the line forming region can not be too close to cas  a. the implied lower limit to the distance between cas  a and the cloud is 115 pc .",
    "on the other hand , if the cloud is farther away from cas  a , then much of the line width is due to pressure broadening .",
    "two possible combinations of electron temperature and density ( @xmath21 ) that can account for the line width are ( 75 k , 0.15 @xmath22 ) and ( 20 k , 0.65 @xmath22 ) .",
    "the solutions are not unique .",
    "the observed line width thus gives constraints on the combination of @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "two types of models are generally considered for the line forming regions ( konovalenko 1984 , sorochenko and walmsley 1991 , payne et al 1994 ) : the _ warm gas models _ with @xmath24 k and association with hi regions and _ cold gas models _ with @xmath25 k and association with molecular gas .",
    "the models are evaluated by computing the expected variation of integrated line strength with quantum number and comparing with the observed values .",
    "the combinations of @xmath21 and @xmath9 are chosen to be consistent with the constraints from the line widths .",
    "the effects of a dielectronic - like recombination on the population of high-@xmath26 states of carbon are taken into account while calculating the expected line strength ( walmsley and watson 1982 ) .",
    "fig 1b shows all the available data towards cas  a gathered from the literature by payne et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "the solid line shows the predictions of a warm gas model with @xmath8 = 75 k , @xmath27 @xmath22 , @xmath23=3200 k and em = 0.012 pc @xmath28 . the dashed line is a cold gas model with @xmath8 = 20 k , @xmath7 = 0.65 @xmath22 , @xmath29 k and em = 0.012 pc @xmath28 .",
    "the curves are normalized to the observed data point at 34.5 mhz .",
    "clearly the cold gas model does not provide a good fit to the data .",
    "the warm gas model provides fairly good fit to the observations .",
    "however , the kinetic pressure implied by the parameters is high - @xmath30 @xmath22 k , although it is still less than the total hydrostatic pressure in the mid - plane .",
    "the success of the warm gas model suggests that the carbon line forming regions may be associated with the cold neutral hi component of the ism .",
    "kantharia et al ( 1998 ) have presented a comparison of the spatial distribution of c270@xmath31 , 21 cm hi and 3 mm @xmath32co emission over the face of cas  a which supports this conclusion .",
    "deriving constraints for the lines detected in the inner galaxy is limited by ( 1 ) availability of few data points ; typically one other data point at 75 mhz ( erickson et al 1995 ) is available and ( 2 ) the unknown angular size of the line region .",
    "the observations at 325 mhz with two angular resolutions indicate that the line forming regions are likely to be larger than @xmath33 . in fig 3 , we show possible warm gas models for three directions assuming the angular size to be @xmath33 .",
    "model parameters are indicated in each frame .",
    "the path lengths through the gas implied by these models ranges from a few tens of pc to more than a kpc and thus a distributed medium is possible . the warm gas models were constrained to provide pressure balance with the ism . no warm gas model could be fitted for cloud sizes larger than @xmath34 . on the other hand",
    "if the cloud sizes are in the range @xmath35 , then cold gas models can be fitted to the data .",
    "however these models imply path lengths of @xmath36 pc which would be in conflict with the observed large line widths which are most likely due to galactic rotation .",
    "the kinetic pressure in the cold gas models are typically a factor of ten larger than the average ism value .",
    "the overall evidence seem to favour the warm gas models .",
