    "an understanding of the nature of the electron spectral function in the underdoped ` pseudogap ' regime has emerged as one of the central problems in the study of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "a wealth of data has appeared in photoemission studies , some of which @xcite has been interpreted using a model of `` fermi arcs '' across the brillouin zone diagonals ; other studies @xcite have indicated the presence of pocket fermi surfaces in the same region of the brillouin zone .",
    "scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) studies @xcite also indicate a fermi arc of excitations which appears to end abruptly at the magnetic brillouin zone boundary associated with two sublattice nel order .",
    "another issue of interest in experiments has been the angular dependence of the electronic excitation gap energy in the superconducting state .",
    "a ` dichotomy ' has been noted @xcite between the behavior of the gap near the nodal points on the brillouin zone diagonals , and the antinodal points along the principle axes of the brillouin zone .",
    "related studies have also been made of the electronic spectra in the electron - doped cuprates @xcite . here",
    "the spectra seem to be closer to that expected from conventional spin density wave theory , and so constitute an important testing ground of theoretical ideas .",
    "the recent observation of quantum oscillations in a strong magnetic field @xcite has given further impetus to the development of a theory the normal state of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "some of the transport data @xcite has been interpreted in terms of the presence of electron pockets in the hole - doped cuprates , for which there is no apparent evidence in the photoemission studies ; the latter , however , have only been carried out without a magnetic field .",
    "finally , an important motivation for our study comes from numerical studies @xcite of hubbard - like models for the cuprate superconductors .",
    "these studies show a significant regime without any antiferromagnetic order , but with a dichotomy in the normal state electronic spectra between the nodal and anti - nodal regimes . it would clearly be useful to have analytic effective models which can be used to interpret the numerical data , and we shall propose such models here .",
    "the theory we present here builds upon the framework set up in refs .  .",
    "these papers described a non - fermi liquid state which was labeled an ` algebraic charge liquid ' ( acl ) ; this state was obtained after the loss of antiferromagnetic order in a metal via an unconventional transition @xcite . as we will review below , in its simplest realization ,",
    "the degrees of freedom of the acl are spinless fermions and a @xmath0 complex boson @xmath1 which interact via an emergent u(1 ) gauge force .",
    "this gauge force has strong effects even in possible deconfined phases , and can lead to the formation of electron - like bound states between the fermions and @xmath1 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present a general discussion of the dynamics of these fermionic bound states , and their influence on the photoemission spectra .",
    "a full description of the pseudogap regime in the hole - doped cuprates will also require @xcite considerations of pairing of these fermionic bound states into bosonic cooper pairs : this we defer to a subsequent paper .    in our previous work @xcite , we presented analytic arguments based upon the structure of a continuum theory valid at long wavelengths . here",
    ", we shall present a more general formulation of the theory , which allows computation of the electronic spectrum across the entire brillouin zone",
    ". we shall show how arguments based upon symmetry and gauge invariance allow construction of an effective theory for the electronic spectrum .",
    "the theory will contain a number of coupling constants , whose values will have to be determined by comparing to numerical studies or experiments . also , while the previous work @xcite used strong - coupling perspective , starting from the schwinger boson theory of the antiferromagnet .",
    "it is possible to derive the results presented below also from this strong - coupling approach .",
    "however , we will choose to present our results by departing @xcite from the `` spin - fermion '' model , which was originally developed from the weak coupling expansion .",
    "let us begin by defining the lagrangian , @xmath2 , of the spin - fermion model .",
    "@xcite we consider fermions @xmath3 @xmath4 hopping on the sites of a square lattice .",
    "these are coupled to the fluctuations of the unit vector field @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) representing the local orientation of the collinear antiferromagnetic nel order .",
    "we will restrict our attention here to antiferromagnetic order at wavevector @xmath7 , although generalizations to other @xmath8 are possible . throughout , we will freely make a gradient expansion of @xmath5 over spatial co - ordinates @xmath9 , focusing on the long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter . however , the fermion fields @xmath10 have important low energy modes at many locations in the brillouin zone , and so we will not make any gradient expansion on the fermion operators .",

    ". almost all previous studies of the spin - fermion model @xcite have involved a perturbative treatment in powers of the coupling @xmath15 , along with resummations of this expansion . here",
    ", we will not expand in powers of @xmath15 , treating it is a coupling of order unity : instead our analysis are motivated by expansions either in the number of field components , or by small @xmath16 .",
    "for sufficiently small values of the coupling @xmath16 , the model @xmath2 clearly has an antiferromagnetically ordered spin density wave ( sdw ) ground state with @xmath20 .",
    "we are interested here in the mechanism by which this order is lost as @xmath16 is increased , and a metallic state with no broken symmetries is obtained . in a recent paper @xcite with others , we argued that there were 2 generic possibilities : + ( _ i _ ) in the first case , there was a direct transition at a single critical @xmath21 to a fermi liquid metal with a large fermi surface .",
    "this transition has been examined in previous work @xcite , and is directly expressed in terms of fluctuations of the o(3 ) order parameter @xmath18 ; the @xmath22 crossovers above @xmath21 have also been described @xcite .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) the second possibility involved intermediate non - fermi liquid phases before the large fermi surface metal was reached at sufficiently large @xmath16 . in this case , the o(3 ) order parameter was parameterized in terms of the spinor @xmath1 by @xmath23 the spinor field @xmath1 is the natural variable to describe the loss of magnetic order at @xmath21 , and the non - fermi liquid phases above @xmath24 , and replaces the o(3 ) order parameter @xmath18",
    ".    our focus in the present paper will be on the second possibility .",
    "part of our motivation comes from transport measurements @xcite , which show an extended regime of non - fermi liquid behavior as @xmath25 in high magnetic fields .",
    "we shall describe the photoemission spectra at non - zero temperatures on both sides of @xmath24 .",
    "our @xmath26 results are candidates for the pseudogap regime of the cuprates , and relate especially to recent experimental results of meng _ et al . _ @xcite .    to complement the approach taken in ref .",
    ", here we will motivate our choice of the non - magnetic non - fermi liquid phases by extending the theory @xcite of the loss of nel order in the insulator at half filling .",
    "although motivated in a theory of metals , @xmath2 also contains ( in principle ) a complete description of the insulating states at half - filling .",
    "crucial to the description of insulators,@xcite are ` hedgehog ' point tunneling events ( ` instantons ' ) in which @xmath18 points radially outwards / inwards from a spacetime point .",
    "these hedgehogs carry berry phases : in @xmath2 the berry phases are expected to appear from the determinant of the gapped fermions integrated out in a hedgehog field for @xmath18 .",
    "all previous treatments of the spin - fermion model have neglected the hedgehog berry phases , and this may well be appropriate under suitable circumstances in certain superconducting states.@xcite    in this paper , we wish to focus on regimes and phases where the hedgehog tunnelling events are suppressed . in the insulator ,",
    "the hedgehog suppression is a consequence of quantum interference from the hedgehog berry phases , and leads to interesting new ` deconfined ' phases and critical points.@xcite hedgehog suppression is also possible in certain exotic metallic states ( to be described below ) , where fermionic excitations near a fermi surface lead to a divergence in the hedgehog action.@xcite    it is useful to begin our analysis by adapting the phase diagram of ref .   describing the doping of an insulating deconfined critical point ",

    "in contrast to fig . [",

    "again , the inner half of the pockets has higher spectrum weight , as the quasiparticle on outer half of the pockets is primarily made of fermion quasiparticles at @xmath204 .",
    "the broadening of the spectrum comes from two factors : first , the @xmath205 boson has a finite life - time @xmath206 ; second , the convolution is done at finite temperature , so the energy of fermion and boson excitation does not have to be exactly zero , but can vary by energies of order @xmath189 .",
    "the second factor dominantes in the rc regime because @xmath207 , and @xmath196 is of order 1 .",

    "we conclude by reviewing the different routes @xcite by which the spin fermion model @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ esf ] ) can lose antiferromagnetic order , and their implications for the photoemission spectrum at finite temperatures .",
    "the first , more conventional , route is that there is a single direct transition at @xmath21 to a fermi liquid with a large fermi surface .",
    "then in the @xmath189-@xmath16 plane , we have the conventional @xcite quantum disordered ( qd ) , quantum critical ( qc ) , and renormalized classical ( rc ) regions .",
    "in qd region at small @xmath189 for @xmath211 , the electron spectrum will show quasiparticle peaks with a fermi liquid linewidth @xmath212 . in the qc region near @xmath213 ,",
    "the spectrum will again show weight along the large fermi surface , but with large anomalous linewidths near the ` hot spots ' : these are points along the large fermi surface connected by the ordering wavevector @xmath8 . finally , in the rc region at small @xmath189 for @xmath190 , we have the behavior described in section  [ sec : rc ] : the spectrum has ` small ' fermi pockets which are centered at the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone boundary , and the quasiparticle peaks have a width @xmath214 ; examples of such spectra were shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : conv ] , [ fig : conv2 ] .",
    "this paper mainly considered a more exotic route @xcite towards loss of antiferromagnetic order in the spin - fermion model .",
    "this route is possible if topological `` hedgehog '' tunnelling events are suppressed as the transition , as they are at magnetic - disordering transitions in the insulator ( see fig .",
    "[ figrkk ] ) .",
    "then the transition at @xmath21 is to a non - magnetic non - fermi liquid acl , with the spinless fermions @xmath145 and complex bosonic spinons @xmath1 as elementary excitations , interacting ( in the simplest case ) via an emergent u(1 ) gauge force .",
    "again , around this critical point at @xmath21 , we can define the corresponding rc , qc , and qd regions .",
    "the electron spectrum in the rc region is just as in the first case above , as discussed in section  [ sec : rc ] and appendix  [ smallg ] .",
    "the novel spectrum in the qd region was the main focus of section  [ sec : bound ] .",
    "one contribution to the spectral weight comes from the convolution of the deconfined spinons and the @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to incoherent spectral weight in ` arc'-like regions which were described earlier in ref .  .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that the spinons and @xmath145 form electron - like bound states , and these were described in more detail in section  [ sec : bound ] .",
    "we found that the bound states lead to pocket fermi surfaces , as shown in figs  [ fig : poplot]-[fig : poplot4 ] .",
    "an important feature of these spectra are that the pockets are not centered at the point @xmath203 on the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone boundary .",
    "in fact , this zone boundary plays no special role , and there are no symmetry relations on the quasiparticle dispersions across it .",
    "we note that recent photoemission observations @xcite show features related to this qd region .",
    "we did not address the qc region here , but it should mainly have the incoherent arc spectra , as described in ref .  .",
    "we also noted a similarity between our acl qd results , and the yrz model @xcite in section  [ sec : bound ] .",
    "the assumptions of yrz are very different from ours , as they depart from a paired fermionic spinons in a spin - liquid state .",
    "the fermi surfaces in the yrz model to not obey the conventional luttinger theorem , as is the case in our model .",
    "however , such a violation must be accompanied by gauge forces reflecting the topological order in such a state @xcite : these gauge fields do not appear in their formulation . also , we dealt mainly with the influence of local antiferromagnetic order on the electron spectrum .",
