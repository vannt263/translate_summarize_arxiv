    "the projection of such a curve on the @xmath15-plane is the chebyshev curve @xmath16 which has exactly @xmath17 crossing points ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will say that such a knot has the chebyshev diagram @xmath18 .",
    "we observed in @xcite that the trefoil can be parametrized by chebyshev polynomials : @xmath19 .",

    "most known properties of lissajous knots are deduced from their symmetries ( see @xcite ) .",
