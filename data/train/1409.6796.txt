    "let @xmath2 be a finite connected graph and @xmath6 be an embedding of @xmath2 into the euclidean 3-space @xmath0 . if the fundamental group @xmath3 is free , then we say that the embedding @xmath1 is _",
    "free_.    the freeness of fundamental group plays a key role in detecting the unknottedness of graphs in @xmath0 . a graph embedded into @xmath0(or its embedding into @xmath0 )",
    "is said to be _ unknotted _ if it lies on an embedded surface in @xmath0 which is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere .",
    "it is known that a simple closed curve embedded in @xmath0 is unknotted if and only if it is free @xcite .",
    "this result was generalized by scharlemann and thompson .",
    "they proved that for any planar graph @xmath2 its embedding @xmath1 is unknotted if and only if @xmath7 is free for every subgraph @xmath8 of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore this criterion is valid even when determining whether a graph has a linkless embedding .",
    "it was proved , by robertson , seymour and thomas , that a graph @xmath2 has a linkless embedding if and only if it has an embedding @xmath1 such that @xmath7 is free for every subgraph @xmath8 of @xmath2 @xcite .    in this paper , basically we are interested in the freeness of graph in @xmath0 , but our viewpoint is different from the previous works in the above .",
    "we begin with observing two specific embeddings of the complete graph @xmath9 . in figure",
    "[ fig1 - 1]-(a ) an edge forms a locally knotted arc , hence the embedding illustrated in the figure is not free . for any graph with a cycle",
    ", we may construct a non - free embedding in this way . on the contrary , in figure [ fig1 - 1]-(b ) , every edge is a line segment .",
    "therefore the embedded edges constitute the 1-skeleton of a tetrahedron , and the fundamental group of its complement is free in consequence . motivated by this example , the freeness of such _ linear _ embeddings is studied in this paper .",
    "an embedding of a graph into @xmath0 will be said to be _ linear _ if each edge of the graph is sent to be a line segment .",
    "note that , for a graph to be linearly embeddable , it should be simple , that is , have no multiple edges between any two vertices and no loop edges .    in the late 1980s ,",
    "v. nicholson proved the following theorem which says that the freeness of linear embedding is an intrinsic property of complete graphs :    @xcite [ thm1 ] every linear embedding of the complete graph @xmath10 is free .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to investigate small graphs with such property .",
    "let @xmath2 be a connected graph .",
    "suppose that a cycle of @xmath2 contains @xmath5 consecutive vertices @xmath11 such that the valency of @xmath12 in @xmath2 is two for every @xmath13 .",
    "then for @xmath14 we can construct a linear embedding of @xmath2 so that the path traversing the vertices forms a locally knotted arc , and consequently the embedding is not free .",
    "see figure [ fig1 - 2 ] for example .",
    "to avoid such local knottedness , the graphs in our consideration are restricted so that every vertex is of valency at least three .",
    "let @xmath15 be the set of vertices of @xmath2 .",
    "for a vertex @xmath16 , let @xmath17 denote its valency . and",
    "@xmath18 will denote @xmath19 .",
    "then we have the following theorem :    [ thm2 ] let @xmath2 be a simple connected graph with @xmath20 .",
    "if the minimal valency @xmath18 is at least @xmath21 , then every linear embedding of @xmath2 is free .",
    "here we remark that the condition , @xmath22 , is not sufficient to guarantee the freeness for graphs with more than 7 vertices .",
    "for example figure [ fig1 - 3 ] shows a graph with @xmath23 and @xmath24 which has a non - free linear embedding .",
    "the embedding is obtained by adding 6 additional line segments to a hexagonal trefoil knot so that the additional edges cobound some disks with subarcs of the knot . in consequence",
    "the fundamental group of its complement is a free product of the fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement and a free group .",
    "since the fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is not free , our group is also not free .    motivated by this observation",
    "we show that if the number of vertices of a graph is relatively larger than its minimal valency or connectivity , then it may have a linear embedding which is not free :    [ thm3 ] for any @xmath4 , there are infinitely many simple connected graphs with minimal valency @xmath5 which have non - free linear embeddings .",
    "[ thm4 ] for any @xmath4 , there are infinitely many @xmath5-connected graphs which have non - free linear embeddings .",
    "the proofs of the two theorems are constructive . in theorem [ thm3 ]",
    "the constructed graph has at least @xmath25 vertices , and in theorem [ thm4 ] , at least @xmath26 vertices .",
    "note that for the complete graph @xmath10 , the number of vertices , valency and connectivity are @xmath5 , @xmath27 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to proving the theorems .",
    "theorems [ thm3 ] and [ thm4 ] are proved in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] is given in the final section for our convenience .",

    "let @xmath30 be a copy of the complete graph @xmath31 for @xmath32 . identifying each @xmath12 with a vertex of @xmath30",

    "then the complement of @xmath2 has the same homotopy type as that of the new graph .",
    "again for our convenience let @xmath2 denote the new graph .",

    "_ @xmath52 is free . _",
    "if we glue a @xmath21-ball @xmath53 to @xmath36 along their boundaries , we get the 3-sphere @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55 , and @xmath56 can be regarded as a neighborhood of a linearly embedded @xmath31 in @xmath54 .",
    "therefore by theorem @xmath57 , @xmath52 is free .",
    "* claim 2 . * _ @xmath58 is not free . _    note that @xmath59 , and @xmath60 can be regarded as a neighborhood of a hexagonal trefoil in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore @xmath58 is not free by the unknotting theorem in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath61 is trivial , @xmath62 is a free product of @xmath52 and @xmath58 by the van kampen theorem .",
    "so @xmath62 is not free by claims 1 and 2 .",
    "we repeat gluing @xmath63 to @xmath64 . since @xmath65",
    ", it is concluded that @xmath66 is not free .    for any nontrivial knot other than the trefoil",
    ", the construction in the above can be applied .",
    "therefore we have an infinite family of graphs satisfying the statement of the theorem . note that since the number of line segments necessary to realize polygonal representation of any nontrivial knot is at least 6 @xcite , the number of vertices of each graph in the family is at least @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath67 be the complete bipartite graph .",
    "its vertices are denoted by @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xmath70 , and edges by @xmath71 @xmath72 . and let @xmath8 be a graph obtained by adding edges @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath75 to @xmath67 .",

    ". then the graph @xmath2 is @xmath5-connected .",
    "-connected graph @xmath2,width=264 ]    before constructing a linear embedding of @xmath2 into @xmath0 , let us consider a linear embedding of @xmath8 into the cube @xmath87 \\times [ 1,n ] \\times [ 1,n]$ ] .",
    "a linear embedding of a graph is determined by the positions of its vertices .",
    "construct two linear embeddings @xmath88 and @xmath89 of @xmath8 into @xmath90 so that @xmath91 , @xmath92 for @xmath88 , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 for @xmath89 as illustrated in figure [ fig2 - 12 ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 - 14 ] shows the final linear embedding of @xmath2 obtained by connecting the cubes in the above with @xmath95 line segments .",
    "the embedding is realizable by modifying the cubes so that the top and front faces are leaning as much as necessary .",
    "figure [ fig2 - 13 ] illustrates such modification .",
    "note that the embedded cycle @xmath96 of @xmath2 is a dodecagonal trefoil knot .",
    "consider a process as the following .",
    "let @xmath97 be an embedded graph in @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath98 choose an arc @xmath99 in @xmath0 and a subarc @xmath100 of @xmath101 so that there exists a disk @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 . and let @xmath105 .",
    "then by the hnn - extension theorem @xcite @xmath106 is the free product of @xmath107 and the infinite cyclic group @xmath108 .",
    "therefore for any @xmath4 @xmath109 is a free product of @xmath110 and the free group of rank @xmath5 .",
    "we can see that the embedded graph @xmath2 is obtained through the process as the above starting from a dodecagonal trefoil knot .",
    "so @xmath111 is a free product of the trefoil knot group and a free group , consequently not free . by applying this construction to other nontrivial knots",
    ", we have an infinite family of graphs satisfying the statement of the theorem .",
    "every graph in the family has at least @xmath26 vertices .",

    "the graph contains the complete graph @xmath9 as a subgraph .",
    "if @xmath2 is linearly embedded into @xmath0 , then @xmath9 constitutes the 1-skeleton of a tetrahedron .",
    "consider the relative position of three edges incident to the fifth vertex @xmath16 with respect to the tetrahedron @xmath118 .",
    "then we know that any linear embedding of @xmath2 corresponds to one of the three types illustrated in figure [ fig3 - 1 - 0]-(b ) : @xmath119 , @xmath120 and no edge incident to @xmath16 meets @xmath121 , or @xmath120 and only one edge from @xmath16 meets @xmath122 .",
    "apply the process in the previous section which starts from @xmath9 .",
    "then it can be confirmed that the three types are free .",
    "in fact each type can be isotoped into a plane in @xmath0 .",
    "if the distribution is @xmath117 , @xmath2 should be the graph in figure [ fig3 - 1]-(a ) .",
    "consider a convex hull determined by four vertices of @xmath2 . then , similarly as above , it can be shown that all possible types of linear embedding of @xmath2 are free .",
    "in fact , also in this case , each type can be isotoped into a plane in @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig3 - 1]-(b ) shows an example .",
    "in the rest of this section we consider the case @xmath123 .",

    "lastly , for an ordered sequence @xmath129 of three vertices , define @xmath130    now three lemmas necessary for the proof of theorem [ thm2 ] are introduced .",
    "we begin with a well - known result of conway and gordon .",
    "@xcite [ lem3 - 1 ] every embedding of the complete graph @xmath131 into @xmath0 contains a non - splittable @xmath132-component link as a pair of disjoint cycles .    without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that the vertices embedded by @xmath1 are in general position .",
    "then @xmath1 can be extended to be a linear embedding of @xmath131 . by lemma",
    "[ lem3 - 1 ] we can label the vertices so that the following conditions are satisfied ( see figure [ fig3 - 2 ] for your understanding ) .",

    "we will say that a convex hull @xmath127 is _ trivial _ , if its interior is not penetrated by any line segment between the vertices of @xmath2 . in a previous work of the first author",
    "the linear embeddings of @xmath131 were investigated . an observation from the work",
    "is given here as a lemma .",
    "* section 4 ) [ lem3 - 2 ] the following convex hulls are trivial : @xmath142    considering the conditions of @xmath2 , the following lemma is easily proved",
    ".    [ lem3 - 3 ] the graph @xmath2 contains a hamiltonian cycle .    by lemma [ lem3 - 3 ] there",
    "exists a hexagonal knot @xmath143 in @xmath0 which is a hamiltonian cycle of @xmath2 . and",
    "each component of @xmath144 is a line segment connecting two vertices of @xmath143 .",
    "such line segments will be called _ bridges _ of @xmath143 .",

    "_ case 1 : @xmath143 is the cycle @xmath148 . _ in this case the possible candidates for bridges of @xmath143 are @xmath149 since @xmath150 is trivial , it is a disk whose interior is disjoint from the embedded graph @xmath131 .",
    "therefore @xmath151 can be isotoped to @xmath152 by sliding along @xmath153 ( see figure [ fig3 - 3]-(a ) ) .",
    "now look into @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the trivial convex hull @xmath156 does not contain any edge of @xmath143 .",

    "therefore , slightly pulling down the disk @xmath158 , we can obtain another disk such that it is bounded by @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , and its interior is disjoint from the embedded @xmath131 .",
    "consequently @xmath154 can be isotoped to @xmath155 by sliding along a subarc @xmath161 of @xmath143 ( see figure [ fig3 - 3]-(b ) ) .",
    "applying these two arguments to other candidates , we can construct a graph @xmath162 as seen in figure [ fig3 - 4]-(a ) : the fat vertices correspond to candidates of bridges . and",
    "two fat vertices are connected by an edge , if two corresponding candidates are isotopic as described in the above .",

    "since the graph @xmath162 is connected , for any @xmath174 , the line segment @xmath175 is parallel to @xmath176 .",
    "this implies that @xmath177 . in consequence @xmath178",

    "_ case 2 : @xmath143 is the cycle @xmath182 . _",
    "the possible candidates for bridges of @xmath143 are @xmath183 figure [ fig3 - 4]-(b ) shows that the graph @xmath162 is not connected in this case .",
    "but the line segment @xmath184 bounds the trivial @xmath185 together with @xmath186 which constitute an arc of @xmath143 .",
    "this implies that if @xmath184 is @xmath36 , then it is parallel to @xmath187 .",
    "also @xmath152 belonging to the other component of @xmath162 bounds the trivial @xmath150 together with an arc @xmath188 of @xmath143 .",
    "therefore the arguments in case 1 is still valid , and we can conclude that @xmath179 is free .",
    "we had checked the remaining 58 cases ( in fact , permuting the vertices @xmath57 and @xmath21 , it is enough to check 28 cases ) . in each of the cases , either the graph @xmath162 is connected or every connected component of @xmath162 contains a fat vertex whose corresponding line segment bounds a trivial disk together with an arc of @xmath143 .",
