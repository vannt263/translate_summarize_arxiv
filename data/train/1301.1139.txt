    "ultracold atoms can be prepared with almost complete control over their density , temperature and interactions .",
    "they serve as model systems for exploring unsolved problems in many - body physics as well as for demonstrating well - known textbook physics , such as of ideal , non - interacting gases that do not exist in nature .",
    "for example several phenomena related to pauli blocking of fermions were clearly demonstrated only after the advent of ultracold fermi gases @xcite .",
    "here we use the tunability of atomic interactions near feshbach resonances to create a non - interacting fermi gas with two components .",
    "this is a realization of an ideal , non - interacting free electron gas ( feg ) with spin up and down components , as assumed in the simple theory of metals .",
    "we demonstrate how such an ideal fermi gas will respond to effective magnetic fields , which is described by pauli paramagnetism .",
    "the paper is mainly pedagogical .",
    "it explains how paramagnetism is observed in trapped atomic samples which have an inhomogeneous density due to the harmonic confinement potential .",
    "furthermore , these atomic samples realize a canonical ensemble in the fixed atom numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the two components , whereas in metals and solid - state physics , @xmath3 is the magnetization determined by the applied external magnetic field . in all previous studies of paramagnetism ,",
    "the magnetization was weak since the applied magnetic field times the magnetic moment was much smaller than the fermi energy @xcite . with ultracold atoms , we can easily realize the strong field case where the chemical potential difference is larger than the fermi energy and therefore fully polarizes the gas .",
    "besides its pedagogical purpose , this paper experimentally demonstrates pauli paramagnetism in a truly non - interacting system exactly described by basic theory , whereas measurements even in simple metals revealed major discrepancies due to interaction effects @xcite .",

    "it is the sum of the latter lagrange multiplier and the external magnetic field which constitutes the effective magnetic field in our ensemble .",
    "the contribution from the external magnetic field is always canceled out by an additive component in this multiplier .",
