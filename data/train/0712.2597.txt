    "we generalize in a different direction .",
    "namely , we make use of multi - column generalizations of temperley - lieb algebras .",
    "those are the temperley - lieb - martin algebras ( or tlm algebras ) introduced by martin in @xcite .",
    "their irreducible representations correspond to young shapes with at most @xmath2 columns .",
    "in @xcite brzeziski and katriel gave a description of tlm algebras in terms of generators and relations .",
    "however , in order to deal with the combinatorics of tlm algebras one desires more than that : it is natural to ask whether a diagrammatic calculus exists for tlm algebras similar to that of kauffman diagrams for temperley - lieb algebras .",
    "it appears that the @xmath1 spiders of kuperberg @xcite essentially provide such calculus for @xmath3 .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : web ] we review the presentation of tlm algebras obtained in @xcite .",

    "such presentation for @xmath3 is implicit in @xcite .",
    "namely , kuperberg considered planar diagrams , or @xmath1-_webs _ , with each inner vertex of degree @xmath0 and each boundary vertex of degree @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , an orientation on edges of the web is given that makes every vertex either a source or a sink .",
    "the following _ spider reduction rules _ were introduced in @xcite :    unless specified otherwise the word web will refer to @xmath1-web in what follows .",
    "it is known that every non - reduced web can be uniquely reduced to a linear combination of reduced webs using the above rules , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 5.1 ) .",
    "note that the webs introduced in @xcite have arbitrary boundary conditions , while we restrict our attention to the webs having @xmath39 sources on the left and @xmath39 sinks on the right .",

    "* theorem 6.1 ) the dimension of @xmath49 is equal to the number of @xmath55-invariants @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the two fundamental representations of @xmath55 .",

    "this number is exactly the dimension of @xmath54 .",
    "it follows from rsk correspondence and the theory of greene - kleitman invariants that this number is equal to the number of @xmath62-avoiding permutations , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus the dimensions of @xmath49 and @xmath54 are equal .",
    "we postpone the proof of injectivity till theorem [ thm : rhom ] .",
    "the two facts together imply that @xmath53 is an isomorphism .",
    "in particular , one can define elements @xmath63 of @xmath54 for each web @xmath64 occurring in @xmath49 . as @xmath64 runs over irreducible webs @xmath65 form a _ web basis _ of @xmath54 .",
    "note that unlike in the case of temperley - lieb algebra , the @xmath65 are not always monomials in the @xmath66 .",
    "for example in @xmath67 one of the webs can be expressed as @xmath52_q ( e_2^{(1)}e_1^{(1)}e_2^{(2)}-e_2^{(2)})$ ] .",
    "denote @xmath68 the set of webs @xmath64 of size @xmath39 .",
    "each edge @xmath69 has two sides , which we denote @xmath70 and @xmath71 , so that every edge is directed from its positive to its negative side .",
    "a _ consistent labeling _ of @xmath64 is an assignment of a label @xmath72 to each side of each edge so that the following conditions hold :    1 .",
    "positive sides are labeled with @xmath73 , negative sides are labeled with @xmath74 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath70 is labeled with @xmath41 then @xmath71 is labeled with @xmath75 ; 3 .",
    "the labels adjacent to the same vertex are distinct , i.e. the sides of edges adjacent to every degree @xmath0 vertex in @xmath64 are labeled either with @xmath73 or with @xmath74 .    the labels adjacent to boundary vertices of @xmath64 are called _ boundary labels_. the restriction @xmath76 of a labeling @xmath77 to the boundary is called a _",
    "boundary labeling_. let @xmath78 denote the set of all consistent labelings of @xmath64 , and @xmath79 denote the set of all consistent labelings with a prescribed boundary labeling @xmath76 .",
    "an example of a consistent labeling is given in figure [ fig : sp16 ] .",
    "for this web and this boundary labeling there exists only one consistent labeling , i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "singularity _ of a consistent labeling be one of the following :    1 .   a degree @xmath0 vertex in @xmath64 ; 2 .   a point where an edge of @xmath64 is tangent to a vertical line .",
    "readjusting the embedding of @xmath64 one can clearly make its edges non - vertical , and make no two singularities lie on one vertical line .",
    "let @xmath81 be a singularity of the first kind .",
    "let @xmath82 be labels adjacent to @xmath81 , so they are either @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",

    "for an unordered pair of labels @xmath86 adjacent to @xmath81 define    @xmath87    let @xmath88 be the sum taken over all pairs of labels adjacent to @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath81 be now a singularity of the second kind , and again let @xmath85 be the vertical line passing through @xmath81 . recall that each edge of @xmath64 is oriented from some @xmath41 to @xmath75 .",
    "assume that at @xmath81 line @xmath85 is tangent to the edge labeled @xmath41 at the beginning , @xmath75 at the end .",
    "let    @xmath89    now for a consistent labeling @xmath77 of @xmath64 define @xmath90 where the product is taken over all singularities of a particular embedding of @xmath64 .",
    "the leftmost singularity @xmath81 on figure [ fig : sp16 ] has @xmath91 and @xmath92 to the left of @xmath85 , @xmath91 above @xmath92 , and @xmath93 to the right of @xmath85 . then @xmath94 while @xmath95 , which results in @xmath96 .",
    "for this embedding of the web there are no singularities of the second kind and for this particular labeling @xmath77 we have @xmath97 .",
    "the following is the key property of statistic @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 does not depend on the particular embedding of web @xmath64 .",
    "the first part of figure [ fig : sp14 ] demonstrates that we can bend or unbend edges as long as we do not change the direction at the ends .",
    "indeed , the two singularities created by such bending cancel out , contributing total of @xmath100 into @xmath99 . other cases are similar .",
    "now if we do want to change the direction of one of the edges at its end , we get the situation of the type shown in second part of figure [ fig : sp14 ]",
    ". there an edge changes its side with respect to @xmath85 , and because of that a new singularity is created . for each pair of labels",
    "@xmath101 adjacent to @xmath81 the value @xmath102 becomes one less than it used to be : it either used to be @xmath48 and became @xmath103 , or it used to be @xmath103 and became @xmath104 . similarly for each @xmath105 the value of @xmath102 is one more than it used to be .",
    "that results in the total factor of @xmath106 .",
    "this however cancels out with the new factor @xmath107 coming from the new singularity .",
    "other cases are similar .",
    "it is easy to see now that any two embeddings of the same web can be deformed one into another by a sequence of moves of the above two types .",
    "this implies the statement",
    ".    denote @xmath108 we refer to @xmath109 as to @xmath110-_size _ of @xmath111 .",
    "note that when @xmath17 the @xmath110-size @xmath112 is just the number of elements in @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath113 be the set of all possible boundary labelings @xmath76 of the @xmath38 boundary vertices , and consider the vector space @xmath114 spanned by the abstract variables @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "we define an algebra structure on @xmath114 as follows : @xmath117 is equal to    1 .",
    "@xmath115 , where @xmath76 is the boundary labeling obtained by combining the left half of @xmath118 and right half of @xmath119 , if the right half of @xmath118 is obtained from the left part of @xmath119 via map @xmath120 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath103 otherwise .",
    "it is not hard to see that this product turns @xmath114 into an associative algebra with unity .",
    "consider the map @xmath121 defined by @xmath122 .",
    "[ thm : rhom ] map @xmath123 is an injective algebra homomorphism , and so is map @xmath53 of theorem [ thm : eta ] .    the concatenation product in @xmath49 is clearly compatible with the product structure of @xmath114 .",
    "thus in order to check that @xmath123 is an algebra homomorphism , we need to verify that the defining relations of @xmath49 are satisfied in @xmath114 .",
    "in particular it is enough to check that spider reduction rules are compatible with @xmath123 .",
    "the first two reduction rules from figure [ fig : sp6 ] are easy to verify .",
    "for example , a closed loop produces two singularities .",
    "if the loop is oriented for example clockwise , and labeled by @xmath41 and @xmath75 , then the two singularities contribute the factor @xmath124 each .",
    "thus as @xmath41 ranges through possible values of @xmath73 , the total factor contributed is @xmath125_q$ ] just as it should be according to spider rules .",
    "let us therefore deal with the third rule .",
    "there is only one way to label the sides in the square configuration from the third rule .",
    "namely , the boundary must contain a pair of labels @xmath41 and @xmath75 and another pair of @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the only distinction comes from the relative position of those labels , the two possibilities shown on the figure [ fig : sp15 ] .",
    "one can see that in each case every consistent labeling of some web containing the square configuration is in bijection with a consistent labeling of exactly one of the two possible resolutions .",
    "moreover , the statistic @xmath99 is preserved .",
    "for example in the upper case , the singularity with @xmath41 , @xmath2 on the left cancels out with singularity with @xmath128 , @xmath75 on the right ; while the singularity with @xmath2 , @xmath126 on the right cancels out with singularity with @xmath127 , @xmath128 on the left .",
    "other cases are similar .",
    "now we want to deduce the injectivity , i.e. , that @xmath49 can be realized inside @xmath114 . for each @xmath62-avoiding permutation @xmath11 pick a reduced decomposition @xmath129 , and consider the monomial @xmath130 in @xmath54 .",
    "we use a triangularity argument to show that images @xmath131 are linearly independent .",
    "let @xmath132 be the web obtained by concatenation of webs of generators @xmath133 according to @xmath134 .",
    "it is a well - known result ( going back to erds ) that every @xmath62-avoiding permutation can be partitioned into @xmath0 increasing subsequences . for a given @xmath14 pick one such partitioning and label the boundary of @xmath132 according to this partitioning , obtaining @xmath135 .",
    "for example , if @xmath136 , @xmath137 and the partitioning is @xmath138 , label the sources with @xmath139 and the sinks with @xmath140 top to bottom .",
    "note that the boundary labeling vector @xmath141 occurs in the decomposition of @xmath131 .",
    "to see this fact , label each diagram @xmath142 ( constituting part of @xmath132 ) so that the output labels are transposed input labels .",
    "since @xmath134 is a reduced decomposition , and since in @xmath16 entries having the same label are increasing , the resulting labeling is consistent . on the other hand , any permutation that produces @xmath16",
    "can be written as combination of @xmath14 and some further transpositions between entries with same labels .",
    "the length of resulting permutation is bigger than that of @xmath14 .",
    "such a permutation can not possibly be achieved by skipping some steps in @xmath143 .",
    "therefore @xmath141 occurs in decomposition of @xmath131 with a non - zero coefficient ( in fact with coefficient @xmath48 ) .",
    "now take any extension of the bruhat order .",
    "then the boundary labeling vector @xmath141 can not occur in decomposition of any @xmath144 for @xmath145 in the chosen order .",
    "this essentially was proven above , given the sub - word characterization of the bruhat order",
    ". therefore the @xmath131 are indeed linearly independent and the dimension of the image of @xmath54 in @xmath114 is equal to the number of @xmath62-avoiding permutations in @xmath15 . as we already know",
    "this is exactly the dimension of @xmath54 and the injectivity of both @xmath123 and @xmath53 follows .",
    "let @xmath146 be a reducible web , and let @xmath147 be the decomposition of the corresponding element of @xmath54 into irreducibles .",
    "let us consider the process of reduction of @xmath64 using the spider rules .",
    "this can be viewed as a binary tree with a branching whenever we apply the third rule .",
    "when descending towards one of the leaves of the tree , a coefficient is accumulated via the first two spider rules .",
    "the coefficient @xmath148 is equal to the sum @xmath149 of the coefficients corresponding to leaves @xmath150 of the tree in which we end up with @xmath151 . the figure [ fig : sp8 ] illustrates a possible tree ( a fragment of the whole web is shown ) .",
    "let us now start with a consistent labeling of @xmath64 . from the proof of theorem [ thm : rhom ]",
    "we know that when each of the spider reduction rules is applied , we get a map from the consistent labelings of the original web to the consistent labellings of the resulting web .",
    "furthermore , at each branching point the current labeling dictates into which of the two branches we go .",
    "thus we can define the _ type _ of the original labeling @xmath77 as the irreducible web @xmath151 we end up with .",
    "note that the type of a labeling a priori might depend on the choice of spider reduction steps .",
    "it seems likely that it is actually independent of the choices made , however it is not necessary for the further argument . from now on we assume that for every possible web one possible branching sequence of reduction steps is chosen .",
    "let @xmath76 be a boundary labeling for @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath152 denote the set of consistent labelings of @xmath64 with boundary @xmath76 and of type @xmath151 .",
    "[ thm : ci ] the following holds : @xmath153    choose a particular sequence of reductions producing a binary tree as above .",
    "the spider reduction rules provide a surjection from the consistent labelings of @xmath64 with boundary @xmath76 and of type @xmath151 onto the consistent labelings of the @xmath151-leaves .",
    "the relative @xmath110-size of the fiber of each letter is exactly the coefficient that appears by applying the spider rules when we descend into that particular leaf .",
    "therefore the set @xmath152 of consistent labelings of @xmath64 with boundary @xmath76 of type @xmath151 gets partitioned into the union of sets with @xmath110-size @xmath154 as @xmath150 runs over type @xmath151 leaves and @xmath155 is the coefficient created when descending into leaf @xmath150 . since by definition @xmath156 , we conclude the needed statement .    the rest of the paper proceeds with @xmath17 .",
    "for a function @xmath157 and an @xmath158 matrix @xmath159 an _ immanant _ @xmath160 is defined by @xmath161 we define web immanants by analogy with the _ temperley - lieb immanants _ of rhoades and skandera @xcite .    for each irreducible web @xmath146 and @xmath11 let @xmath162 be the coefficient of @xmath65 in the image @xmath163 . then the immanants @xmath164 are called _",

    "now we are ready to consider the properties of web immanants .",

    "an immanant is totally nonnegative if , when applied to any totally nonnegative matrix , it produces a nonnegative number .",
