    "we construct the optical lieb lattice by superimposing three types of optical lattices ( see fig .

    "is realized by interference of the mutually orthogonal laser beams at @xmath19  nm along the @xmath22- and @xmath14-directions .",
    "compared to the proposals @xcite , equation  ( [ eq_potential ] ) lacks a diagonal lattice with @xmath23 spatial dependence .",
    "while this causes slightly larger discrepancy from the ideal tight - binding energy bands , the sufficiently deep lattices can reproduce the desired energy spectrum including the flat band , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_setup]e . in the following , we specify each lattice depth in unit of long - lattice recoil energy as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the atomic mass of @xmath27yb .",
    "the motion of free bosons in the @xmath22-@xmath14 plane is governed by tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the annihilation operator on site @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath32 is mainly determined by @xmath18 , whereas the other lattice depths set an energy offset @xmath33 of each sublattice .",
    "excepting the contribution from the zero - point energies of each potential well , they are approximately given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , which are able to be independently controlled by tuning the lattice depths . in the @xmath37-direction which is perpendicular to the lieb lattice plane , the atoms are weakly confined in a harmonic trap ( one - dimensional tube configuration ) , unless otherwise specified .",
    "in addition to each lattice depth , three phase parameters should be set to @xmath9 and @xmath10 in order to realize the characteristic three - sublattice structure of the lieb lattice depicted in fig .",

    "error bars denote standard deviation of three independent measurements .",
    ", width=321 ]    one of the fundamental properties of flat bands is the localization of the wave function as a consequence of quantum - mechanical interference of traveling matter waves .",
    "the localization is due to a purely geometric effect , as we briefly explain below .",
    "the hilbert space for the lieb lattice in the tight - binding regime is spanned by the quasimomentum eigenstates of each sublattice @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "nearest neighbor tunneling induces the momentum dependent coupling @xmath42 between the @xmath5- and @xmath6-sublattices , and similarly @xmath43 between the @xmath5- and @xmath7-sublattices , where @xmath44  nm is the lattice periodicity .",
    "the flat band states are the zero - energy eigenstates @xmath45 with @xmath46 , which have no amplitude on the @xmath5-sublattice .",
    "consequently , a wave packet composed of the flat band states remains localized , as the tunneling from a @xmath6-site and a @xmath7-site destructively interfere on the adjacent @xmath5-site .",
    "we explore this nature in the following experiments . here",
    "we note that the flat band in the lieb lattice is mathematically equivalent to `` dark states '' of laser - coupled @xmath47-type three level systems in atomic physics . here , three sublattices correspond to the basis of three levels , tunneling amplitudes serve as laser - induced coupling , and energy difference of each sublattice plays a role of the detuning of laser .",
    "in a lieb lattice , a flat band is realized as the first excited band , hence a bec loaded adiabatically into an optical lieb lattice is not populated in the flat band .",
    "however , tunability of our optical lieb lattice enables to coherently transfer the population in the lowest band into the flat band by phase imprinting ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_bandtransfer]a ) .",
    "the scheme is easily understood by considering tight - binding wave functions in each band . at zero quasimomentum and in the equal - offset condition @xmath48 , a simple calculation gives @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 from the 1st to the 3rd band , where we omit the momentum indices from the sublattice eigenstates ( see also supplementary information ) .",
    "taking advantage of rich controllability in our lattice potential , we can smoothly modify these eigenstates .",
    "with sufficiently large @xmath20 ( equivalently with large @xmath52 ) , the lowest bloch state has essentially no amplitude in the @xmath5-sublattice , allowing to realize @xmath53 state .",
    "next , we apply sudden change in one of the long lattice , @xmath54 .",
    "this creates the energy difference between the @xmath6- and @xmath7-sublattices and the relative phase of the condensate wave function starts to evolve with a period @xmath55 .",
    "in the basis of the initial band structure , this time evolution is a coherent oscillation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the explicit procedure of the loading and detecting a condensate in the flat band is as follows .",
    "we adiabatically load a bec of @xmath58 @xmath59yb atoms into the lieb lattice with @xmath60 and apply sudden increase of @xmath61 to @xmath62 for variable duration . at the same time",
    ", we ramp @xmath63 up to @xmath64 to prevent tunneling during the band transfer . after this sequence , we return the lattice depths to the initial values and perform adiabatic turning off of the lattice potential in order to map quasimomentum to free - particle momentum ( band mapping ) @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_bandtransfer]b shows the absorption images taken after @xmath65  ms of the ballistic expansion , which reveal the interband dynamics of a condensate . at zero quasimomentum ,",
    "atoms in the 2nd and 3rd band are mapped to the same point of the brillouin zone .",
    "in addition , the finite spread of the condensate makes it difficult to precisely distinguish the population in the 2nd brillouin zone from other neighboring zones .",
    "therefore , instead of plotting the population in the 2nd brillouin zone , here we count atoms in the 1st brillouin zone , and show the fraction of atoms in the other higher bands in fig .",
    "[ fig_bandtransfer]c . for momentum space analysis ,",
    "see section iii of supplementary information .",
    "we fit the data with the function in the form @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the numerical solution of the single particle schrdinger equation . in fitting the data ,",
    "we adopt @xmath61 during the band transfer as a free parameter , and obtain the best fit with @xmath68 , close to the expected value of @xmath62 .",
    "although the oscillations involve non - negligible contributions from the higher bands , at the half period of the first cycle we expect that @xmath69% of atoms are transferred to the 2nd band .",
    "this transfer method is also applicable in the presence of the lattice confinement along the @xmath37-axis , though the decay time of the oscillation @xmath70",
    "@xmath71s is much shorter than the case of a weak harmonic confinement ( 1d - tube ) , @xmath72  @xmath71s .",
    "we measure the lifetime of atoms in the 2nd band of the optical lieb lattice . after transferring to the 2nd band , we change the depth @xmath73 of the diagonal lattice to control the energy gap between the 1st and 2nd band . as well as the band gap",
    "@xcite , lifetime of a quantum gas in the excited band is strongly affected by the density overlap with the states in the lower bands @xcite .",
    "as we increase @xmath73 , the average gap between the 1st and 2nd band becomes smaller and at the same time their density profiles become similar to each other . in the opposite limit of shallow @xmath73 ,",
    "the band gap increases and two bands have no density overlap , as the lowest band mostly consists of the @xmath5-sublattice .",
    "we take a variable hold time in the lattice , followed by band mapping to count the atom number in the excited bands .",
    "typical absorption images are shown in fig .",
    ". the decay curves displayed in fig .  [ fig_lifetime]b show expected behavior of increasing lifetime with decreasing @xmath73 . in addition , increasing the gap makes the dynamics more clearly separate into two process : decay of the condensate within the 2nd band ( middle image of fig .  [",
    "fig_lifetime]a ) and decay of atoms into the lowest band ( bottom image ) .",
    "we find that the curve is well fitted by double exponential with the form @xmath74 .",
    "the fast component @xmath75 shows only weak dependence on @xmath73 , whereas the slow component @xmath76 shows over @xmath64-fold changes from the smallest to largest @xmath73 .",
    "we also extract the lifetime of the condensate in the 2nd band , @xmath77 , by counting atoms on the corner of the 2nd brillouin zone ( figure  [ fig_lifetime]a ) , and find similar behavior with @xmath75 .",
    "this implies that the intial fast decay is related to the decay of the condensate , which involves the decay to the lower band with faster time constant compared with the non - condensed atoms .",
    "as described above , the most intriguing property of a flat band is the localization of the wave function at certain sublattice sites . in the case of the lieb lattice ,",
    "the wave function of the flat band vanishes on the @xmath5-sublattice .",
    "here we reveal this property by observing the tunneling dynamics of a bose gas initially condensed at the @xmath78 state , and compare it to the dynamics of the state with opposite relative phase , @xmath79 . in order to observe real - space dynamics of the system ,",
    "we perform projection measurement of the occupation number in each sublattice , which we call sublattice mapping . in this method , first we quickly change the lattice potential to @xmath80 . in this configuration ,",
    "all three sublattices are energetically well separated from one another and the lowest three bands consist of the @xmath5-,@xmath6- and @xmath7-sublattice , respectively .",
    "this maps sublattice occupations to band occupations , which then can be measured by band mapping technique .",
    "figure [ fig_tunneling]a shows the demonstration of this method , in the cases where atoms occupy only one of the sublattices .",
    "note that the populations in the @xmath6- and @xmath7-sublattices are mapped to the 2nd brillouin zones for the one - dimensional lattice along the @xmath22 and @xmath14-axis , respectively .",
    "this is because the turning off of the diagonal lattice decouples these two directions and the fundamental bands are labeled by the combination of band indices of 1d lattices .",
    "we prepare the initial state @xmath81 by simply loading a bec into the lieb lattice with deep @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath82 state is obtained by applying band transfer method to the @xmath81 state .",
    "dynamics of these initial states after the lattice depths are changed to satisfy the equal - offset condition @xmath48 is measured by the sublattice mapping . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_tunneling]b , we reveal qualitatively different behaviors of these two states : the @xmath82 state shows a significant suppression of the @xmath5-sublattice occupancy , indicating the freezing of the tunneling dynamics to the @xmath5-sublattice from the @xmath82 state with only a slow decay to the @xmath5-sublattice , whereas the @xmath81 state exhibits coherent oscillations between the @xmath5- and ( @xmath83)-sublattices . this clearly features the geometric structure of the lieb lattice mentioned above .",
    "double exponential fit to the data for the @xmath82 initial state yields @xmath84  ms and @xmath85  ms , indicating that the leakage to the @xmath5-sublattice is caused by the decay to the lowest band .    in the bloch basis ,",
    "the state @xmath81 is expressed as @xmath86 and its time evolution is driven by the band gap @xmath87 which equals @xmath88 in the tight binding limit .",
    "after a half period @xmath89 the state evolves to @xmath90 , leading to coherent tunneling to the @xmath5-sublattice .",
    "similarly , it is possible to arrange the initial lattice depths so that the lowest bloch state has the maximum overlap with a certain superposition of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "sudden potential change to the lieb lattice drives oscillation between the @xmath6- and @xmath7-sublattices , whose frequency gives the band gap @xmath91 .",
    "we fit these data with a damped sinusoidal oscillation and compare the extracted frequency with the result of single particle band calculations ( see fig . [",
    "fig_tunneling]c ) .",
    "qualitative behavior is well reproduced , while quantitative discrepancies are found .",
    "this is caused by interactions , as we present a systematic study of the density dependence of the oscillation frequency in section iv of supplementary information .",
    "we further investigate the tunneling dynamics of the @xmath82 initial state by adding the perturbations which destroy the flatness of the second band .",
    "the flatness is robust against the independent change of nearest - neighbor tunneling amplitudes @xmath92 , @xmath93 along the @xmath22- and @xmath14-directions , and energy offset @xmath94 , just as a dark state in a @xmath47-type three level system persists regardless of laser intensities and detuning from the excited state .",
    "however , if the energy difference between the @xmath6- and @xmath7-sublattices is introduced  the two - photon raman off - resonant case  , the flat band is destroyed .",
    "note that the finite @xmath95 induces population in the @xmath5-sublattice even at @xmath96 .",
    "on the other hand , the direct diagonal tunneling between the @xmath6- and @xmath7-sublattices , which is another flat - band - breaking term existing in our system , keeps a dark state at @xmath97 provided @xmath98 .",
    "we create the energy difference by introducing the imbalance of @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ fig_tunneling]d shows the time dependence of the @xmath5-sublattice population for the @xmath82 initial state .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the coherent tunneling dynamics starts to grow as the lattice parameters deviate from the flat - band condition @xmath100 .",
    "after collecting about @xmath101 atoms with a magneto - optical trap with the intercombination transition , the atoms are transferred to a crossed optical trap . then we perform an evaporative cooling , resulting in an almost pure bec with about @xmath102 atoms with no discernable thermal component .",
    "all of the optical lattice experiments presented in this paper are subject to additional weak confinement due to a crossed optical dipole trap operating at @xmath19  nm .",
    "gaussian shape of laser beams for the trap and lattices impose a harmonic confinement on atoms , whose frequencies are @xmath103  hz at the lattice depths of @xmath11 . here , the @xmath104- and @xmath105-axes are tilted from the lattice axes ( @xmath22 and @xmath37 ) by @xmath106 in the same plane .",
    "the relative phases between the long and short lattice ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) can be adjusted by changing the frequency difference between these lattice beams @xcite .",
    "the proper frequencies that realize the lieb lattice ( @xmath109 ) are determined by analyzing the momentum distribution of a @xmath27yb bec released from the lattice , as in the case of the parameter @xmath110 of the diagonal lattice ( supplementary information ) .",
    "the relative phase between the long and short lattices at the position of atoms depends on the optical path lengths from common retro - reflection mirrors , and in general two phases @xmath107 and @xmath108 are not equal .",
    "we shift the frequency of long lattice laser by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) inserted in the path for the @xmath14-axis in order to simultaneously realize @xmath109 .",
    "optimal frequency difference is sensitive to the alignment of the lattice beams and day - by - day calibration of the phases is needed .",
    "typical drift of the required rf frequency for the compensation aom is within @xmath111  mhz .    to stabilize the phase @xmath110",
    ", we construct a michelson interferometer along the optical path of the diagonal lattice with frequency stabilized @xmath112  nm laser .",
    "the interferometer has two piezo electric transducer ( pzt)-mountded mirrors one of which is shared with the lattice laser beam for phase stabilization , and another one for shifting the phase over the range @xmath113 with stabilization kept active .",
    "the short - term stability of @xmath110 is estimated to be @xmath114 .",
    "the last few optics in front of the chamber are outside of the active stabilization , which causes slow drift of @xmath110 due to the change of environment such as temperature .",
    "the typical phase drift is @xmath115 per hour , and all measurements of sequential data set are finished within @xmath64 minutes from the last phase calibration .    at the proper phase parameters @xmath109 and @xmath10 , the potential depth at the center of each site becomes equal when @xmath116 . in this condition , however , the energy offset @xmath117 becomes lower than @xmath118 and @xmath119 because of the difference in the zero - point energies .",
    "we search optimal @xmath20 by single - particle band calculation ( see also supplementary information for the derivation of hubbard parameters ) .      to measure the quasimomentum distribution of atoms ,",
    "we turn off all the lattice potentials with a exponential form @xmath120 with a time constant @xmath121  ms .",
    "the dipole trap is kept constant during band mapping for preventing movement of the trap center due to gravity and suddenly turned off at @xmath122 . because of the relatively heavy mass of yb , the existence of harmonic confinement imposes severe restriction on the choice of mapping time @xmath123 .",
    "we find @xmath124  ms causes considerable deformation of the distribution whereas @xmath125  ms is desirable to suppress interband transition .",
