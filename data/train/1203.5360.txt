    "this difference in velocities occurs for two principal reasons .",
    "first , outflow towards @xmath81 is obstructed by the buildup of plasma and magnetic pressure .",
    "second , the x - line is located near the lower exit of the current sheet so that the tension force below the x - line directed towards @xmath81 is much weaker than the tension force above the x - line directed away from @xmath81 .    in figure [ paperplot_simulation](d ) , there is a stream of plasma flow to the right of the x - line but extending downward into the post - flare loop structure and tracing the separatrix .",
    "the magnitude of the plasma flow is small ( @xmath82 compared to @xmath83 ) , but is positive in a region where negative @xmath84 is expected .",
    "magnetic tension in this region is pulling plasma downward , but is countered by a comparable contribution by the vertical plasma pressure gradient and a modest contribution by the vertical magnetic pressure gradient pushing plasma upward .",

    "case e is identical to case c except for having three times the resistivity , and shows a significant drift of the x - line into the weak magnetic field region .",
    "comparing cases a and g suggests that the inclusion of a density asymmetry does not lead to a significant drift along the inflow direction .",
    "the rate of x - line drifting along the inflow direction is a function of the magnetic field asymmetry , the resistivity , the inclusion of a guide field , and the simulation setup .",
    "however , the dependences on each of these parameters are not straightforward .",
    "the x - line position retreats from the obstruction at @xmath81 for all asymmetric outflow cases [ figure [ paperplot_xn](b ) ] .",
    "the rate of x - line retreat is comparable for cases a and b ( with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively ) but decreases as the initial conditions become more asymmetric . by comparing cases",

    "comparing cases c and f shows that including a guide field can lead to much faster x - line retreat .",
    "in contrast to all other asymmetric outflow simulations , the x - line is located near the top exit of the current sheet in case f.    previous simulations of reconnection with either asymmetric inflow or asymmetric outflow have generally shown a separation between the flow stagnation point and the principal x - line when a uniform resistivity is used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there still is a reversal of the outflow component of velocity near but not colocated with the x - line .",
    "figure [ paperplot_derivs ] shows both the plasma flow velocity at the x - line , @xmath94 , and the rate of change in position of the x - line , @xmath95 , for case c with @xmath55 .",

    ", @xmath96 is of the same sign as @xmath97 , but @xmath96 is significantly greater .",
    "for the outflow direction , @xmath98 remains positive but @xmath99 becomes negative so that the x - line is retreating against the flow of the plasma .",
    "the x - line is able to diffuse against strong plasma flow by diffusion of @xmath100 along the inflow direction , as described in detail by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the maximum in @xmath103 is located on the strong field side of the x - line .",
    "this result that the x - line is on the weak field side of the current sheet is consistent with the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the x - line is located near a local maximum in plasma pressure along the inflow direction . in the simulation reference frame , @xmath104 away from the diffusion region on the strong field side of the current sheet .",
    "this can be interpreted as most of the inflow coming in from the weak field side , with the x - line and current sheet drifting into the strong field upstream region .",
    "the outflow component of velocity , @xmath84 , has an interesting bipolar signature .",
    "while the x - line is moving in the positive @xmath75 direction , the x - line is located near where @xmath84 is most negative .",
    "the inflow component of the magnetic field , @xmath100 , is negative throughout the slice except at the x - line where it is zero .",
    "this profile allows negative @xmath100 to diffuse inward so that at later times the x - line is located at higher heights ( compare to figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "the reconnecting component of the magnetic field , @xmath105 , shows that the initial ratio of @xmath55 is somewhat less extreme than the ratio of @xmath106 at @xmath102 .",
    "the reconnection rate , defined as the out - of - plane component of the electric field at the x - line , is shown in figure [ paperplot_ez ] for each of the cases described in table [ simtable ] .",
    "comparing cases a  d shows that decreasing the magnetic asymmetry factor @xmath107 leads to a corresponding decrease in the reconnection rate .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the scaling derived by @xcite .",
    "increasing the density asymmetry factor @xmath91 decreases the reconnection rate modestly from case a to case g. the reconnection rate in case c is somewhat quicker than case e , even though case e is three times more resistive .",
    "the inclusion of a guide field slightly increases the reconnection rate in case f compared to case c. the reconnection rate is modestly quicker with asymmetric inflow and outflow ( case c ) than in an otherwise equivalent simulation with asymmetric inflow but symmetric outflow .",
    "as described by @xcite , this occurs because the current sheet can only increase in length along one outflow direction .",
    "the asymmetric inflow condition allows net vorticity in the outflow plasmoid . in figure [ paperplot_vorticity ]",
    "we show velocity vectors in the reference frame of the o - point for case c at @xmath102 .",
    "the counter - clockwise flow pattern is largely due to the reconnection outflow jet impacting the rising plasmoid at an angle ; consequently , the outflow jet increases the net vorticity in the plasmoid .",
    "this circulation should be a generic feature of asymmetric inflow reconnection but not asymmetric outflow reconnection .",
    "this interpretation should be considered qualitatively rather than quantitatively because the presence of closed field lines is partially due to reconnection near the outer , artificial line - tied boundary at @xmath72 . however , these results suggest that the orientation of reconnection outflow jets relative to the flux rope can lead to an analogous circulation pattern when the outflow jet impacts the flux rope obliquely rather than directly at its base .",
    "in contrast to the x - point , the frozen - in condition near the o - point is approximately met .",
    "for example , at @xmath102 in case c , the plasma flow at the o - point is approximately equal to the velocity of the o - point : @xmath108 compared to @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the position of the o - point .",
    "this indicates that the o - point is being primarily advected by the bulk plasma flow and that diffusive flow across the o - point is not significant .",
    "plasma flow across an o - point can occur in a process similar to that described by @xcite for x - line retreat .",
    "when the o - point in a magnetic island is displaced towards one particular direction , resistive diffusion will in general act to change the position of the o - point to be closer to the center of the island when the island is not significantly distorted .",
    "the most easily observable difference between the symmetric and asymmetric cases is the structure of the post - flare loops .",
    "in particular , the asymmetric loops are skewed when compared to the symmetric case , and take an asymmetric candle flame shape .",
    "while in the symmetric case the tops of each loop are all along @xmath111 , the loop - tops in the asymmetric case have their apexes at different locations along the inflow direction ( figure [ paperplot_loops ] ) . at low heights where the field has relaxed to a near - potential state ,",
    "the loop - tops are displaced toward the low magnetic field side . at greater heights ,",
    "the loop - tops become located closer to the current sheet demarcating the low and high magnetic field regions .",
    "in section [ loops ] and figure [ paperplot_loops ] we show that the location of the post - flare loop apexes in each case are a function of height . in the current section , we present an analytic solution for the potential field structure of post - flare loops in the present configuration .",
    "this solution provides insight into the observational signatures very near the magnetic field reversal along the lower boundary , but should be treated as a limiting case for post - flare loops late in time that have been able to relax to a near - potential state .",
    "we consider the domain @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the boundary condition along @xmath81 is given by @xmath114 where the constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive and the location of the field reversal is given by @xmath115 consequently , there is no net magnetic flux from the lower boundary over @xmath112 .",
    "because the outer boundary is artificial , we must consider regions close to the magnetic field reversal to avoid these effects .",
    "however , this analysis also assumes that the magnetic field reversal length scale is smaller than the region being investigated . because we are finding a potential field solution we also require that @xmath116 , or more generally , that plasma pressure gradient forces are small .",
    "the potential magnetic field is given by @xmath117 where the scalar potential @xmath118 is governed by laplace s equation , @xmath119 the unique solution to laplace s equation appropriate to our boundary conditions is @xmath120 equation ( [ solution ] ) may be written in the form of a vector potential @xmath121 to provide an expression for the magnetic flux , @xmath122 on large scales , the solution depends on the outer boundary . on scales much smaller than the outer boundary , the solution becomes scale - free as we approach @xmath123 . because in general fourier series expansions will be truncated at some @xmath124 , we must also consider scales @xmath125 .",

    "these solutions approximate the magnetic field structure of post - flare loops after these loops have had time to relax .",

    "next we derive the loop - top positions along the inflow direction as a function of height . by setting @xmath128 and using euler s formula and trigonometric identities",
    ", we can obtain an equation for the height of loop - tops as a function of @xmath129 .",
    "the loop - top positions are given by @xmath130 for our purposes this expression is most useful near the field reversal along the lower boundary at @xmath131 where the solution is insensitive to the outer boundary .",
    "we define @xmath132 as the ( clockwise ) angle with respect to vertical for the loop - top positions . because @xmath133 and @xmath134 , evaluating equation ( [ looptop ] ) at @xmath135 yields @xmath136 equation ( [ magic ] ) provides an upper limit on the distortion of the asymmetric post - flare loops as a function of asymmetry .",
    "the angle from vertical for the loop - top positions is shown in both figures [ paperplot_loops ] and [ analytic_solution ] . in figure",
    "[ paperplot_loops ] we see that equation ( [ magic ] ) reliably approximates the angle from vertical that the loop - top positions take very near the field reversal .",
    "equation ( [ magic ] ) overestimates the angle slightly in the simulations because of the finite width of the magnetic reversal along the lower boundary ( @xmath57 ) and because the field lines are not fully potential due in part to a finite pressure gradient .",
    "in this section , we describe the observational signatures predicted by our simulations of line - tied asymmetric reconnection during solar eruptions .",
    "the location of the principal x - line is important in flare / cme current sheets because it helps determine the partition of outflow energy towards and away from the sun .",
    "these simulations suggest that , at least during reconnection with a weak guide field , the principal x - line will be located near the lower base of flare / cme current sheets , not too far above the post - flare loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the principal x - line and flow reversal are probably separated by a distance that is shorter than the observational errors and systematic uncertainties .",
    "finding the location of the flow reversal in a current sheet viewed nearly edge - on is difficult but can be done by tracking the motions of current sheet blobs .",
    "this task has been accomplished by @xcite , who find that the flow reversal is at a height of just @xmath1@xmath137 solar radii above the limb in the cartwheel cme current sheet . for comparison ,",

    "because of the requirement that equal amounts of flux be reconnected from each upstream region in two - dimensional simulations , we predict that the velocity of the footpoint in the strong field region will be slower than the velocity of the footpoint in the weak field region .",
    "for example , if the magnetic field in one upstream region has twice the strength of the other region , then the footpoints on the strong magnetic field side will move half as quickly as the footpoints on the weak magnetic field side . by combining observations during the 2003 october 29 x10 flare by the _ reuvan ramaty high energy spectroscopic imager _",

    "while this is consistent with the predictions from our models , theory needs to take into account the three - dimensional nature of magnetic reconnection and the patchy distribution of magnetic flux in the photosphere .",
    "asymmetry in the post - flare loop structure will affect the relative intensities from the emissions at each footpoint .",
    "hxr emission is largely determined by the transport of energetic particles from above the loop - top into the chromosphere .",
    "energetic particles on the strong magnetic field side will be more likely to be reflected because magnetic mirroring is more effective .",
    "therefore , energetic particles will be more likely to enter the lower solar atmosphere on the weak magnetic field side .",

    "* ) , and directionality in the accelerating electric field @xcite .",
    "several works have reported observations of reconnection inflow velocities associated with flare / cme current sheets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "during asymmetric inflow reconnection , the inflow velocities on either side of the current sheet are predicted to differ . in a steady - state , one would expect from flux conservation that the out - of - plane electric field will be constant , leading to the relation @xmath141 this implies that the ratio of inflow velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of upstream magnetic field strengths and that in principle measuring the ratio of inflow velocities on either side of the current sheet would directly provide the upstream magnetic field ratio .",
    "figure [ paperplot_inflow ] shows that there are strong variations in the electric field in the simulation reference frame and that the inflow component of velocity is approximately zero in the strong upstream region .",
    "thus the reconnection process in the simulations is not time - independent .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ spoo ] ) should not be expected to give reliable estimates of the magnetic field asymmetry except by taking the velocities in the reference frame of the x - line and showing that the reconnection process is steady . however , despite the inapplicability of equation ( [ spoo ] ) during time - dependent asymmetric reconnection , a systematic demonstration that the reconnection inflows differ on either side of the current sheet will provide suggestive evidence in future observations that the reconnection process is asymmetric .",
    "a commonly observed feature of cme current sheets is that they appear to drift or tilt with time .",
    "_ hinode_/xrt observations of the cartwheel cme show that the current sheet drifted at a rate of @xmath1@xmath142  hr@xmath143 @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed observations on 2002 january 8 of a current sheet with a drift of @xmath1@xmath144  hr@xmath143 .",
    "these drift rates are significantly greater than can be accounted for by solar rotation .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the observed drifting of cme current sheets : ( 1 ) @xcite suggest that the cartwheel cme current sheet is observed at an angle to the plane - of - sky and that the appearance of drifting is caused by different parts of the current sheet actively reconnecting at different times .",
    "( 2 ) the tilting could be due to the drifting of the x - line and current sheet into the strong magnetic field region during line - tied asymmetric reconnection as discussed in this paper .",
    "the predicted velocity of less than a percent of the alfvn speed is within observational constraints .",
    "however , the simulations show drifting but not the observed tilting of the current sheet .",
    "( 3 ) the rising flux rope could pull the plasma sheet region along with it so that the drifting is caused by macroscopic behavior .",
    "this mechanism requires that the current sheet become more aligned with the direction of flux rope propagation . for the cartwheel cme",
    ", however , this appears to not be the case .",
    "( 4 ) there is a large - scale force imbalance between the two upstream regions so that the entire region surrounding the current sheet is pushed rapidly towards one direction .",
    "such a force imbalance could easily occur in the early stages of an ejection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "( 5 ) the tilting is caused by relaxation in the post - eruption active region as the magnetic field configuration becomes more potential .",
    "further numerical and observational tests are required to constrain which mechanisms lead to current sheet drifting during cmes . the location of the cme current sheet",
    "relative to the direction of propagation of the flux rope may be of particular importance in determining how upflow from the current sheet impacts and influences the evolution of the rising plasmoid .",
    "however , it is not yet known if cme current sheets are an important component of the energy and momentum budgets of cmes .      in section [ plasmoid ]",
    "we show that the asymmetric inflow condition allows net vorticity to develop in the outflow plasmoid .",
    "this circulation pattern develops because the outflow jet impacts the rising flux rope obliquely rather than directly at its base .",
    "when the current sheet and direction of flux rope propagation are misaligned , this leads to the possibility that the reconnection outflow jet torques the rising plasmoid .",
    "vortex motions like those seen in figure [ paperplot_vorticity ] are not unique to configurations with a line - tied lower boundary , but rather should be a generic feature of reconnection with asymmetric upstream magnetic fields such as at the dayside magnetopause .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite report observations of several cmes that display a rolling motion about the axis of the erupting prominence .",
    "we hypothesize that this rolling motion is induced by an offset between the cme current sheet and the rising flux rope during some events",
    ". however , it is unknown if the kinetic energy released by reconnection is enough to drive this circulation .",
    "there are other candidate mechanisms for the development of apparent circulation and vorticity in the rising flux rope when viewed in cross - section .",
    "a similar flow pattern could develop by untwisting of the magnetic field in the rising flux rope during expansion and relaxation .",
    "alternatively , the external magnetic field could deflect the flux rope s outward motion , thus leading to apparent rolling behavior .",
    "for example , @xcite note the presence of coronal holes near cmes that display rolling motion .",
    "this rolling behavior about the flux rope axis is in contrast to rotation about the direction of cme propagation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if there is a strong asymmetry in the plasma conditions on the two sides of the current sheet , an asymmetry in the emission line intensities might be expected as well .",
    "an example is seen in figure 12 of @xcite , where the [ ] and [ ] lines are sharply peaked at the same position along the slit , while the emission is shifted about @xmath145 ( one bin along the entrance slit , or @xmath146 mm ) toward the north , and [ ] is shifted still farther north by another @xmath145 .",
    "lower temperature lines such as [ ] are entirely absent from the immediate area of the current sheet , but a definite [ ] feature is seen about @xmath147 to the south .    there is a clear asymmetry in the temperature between the north and south sides of the current sheet in figure 12 of @xcite .",
    "it is hard to estimate the temperatures accurately because of the ambiguity caused by the uncertainty in the foreground and background contributions to the line intensities . roughly speaking , the [ ] and [ ] intensities on the southern side are comparable , indicating a temperature @xmath148 , while on the northern side is several times stronger than [ ] , suggesting @xmath149 .",
    "the density contrast is more difficult to estimate .",
    "based on those temperatures , the emission measure on the northern side is four times that to the south . assuming that the depth along the line of sight is the same on both sides of the current sheet , the density is twice as high to the north .",
    "another density diagnostic is the ly@xmath150  to ly@xmath140ratio . since ly@xmath150  contains comparable contributions from collisionally excited ( @xmath151 ) and radiative scattering ( @xmath152 ) components , while ly@xmath140  is almost entirely formed by radiative scattering , the ratio is a reliable diagnostic .",
    "unfortunately , the separation of the emission from the region of the current sheet from broad background emission is even more difficult than it is for the fe and si lines discussed above .",
    "we estimate that the ly@xmath150  to ly@xmath140  ratios are @xmath153 and @xmath154 on the southern and northern sides , respectively , which would imply that the density is @xmath1@xmath155 times higher in the south than in the north .",
    "each of these density diagnostics is accurate to within about a factor of two , suggesting that the northern and southern densities are comparable to within uncertainties .",
    "overall , we conclude that the plasma pressure is somewhat higher in the north than the south",
    ". it would be dangerous to conclude that the magnetic pressure is higher in the south than the north , however , since the region is probably not in equilibrium .",
    "asymmetry in the upstream temperatures might also affect the charge state distribution in the current sheet plasma and the rising flux rope .",
    "for example , the two upstream regions could start in ionization equilibrium at @xmath156 and @xmath157 mk .",
    "plasma entering the current sheet will be heated very quickly to @xmath1@xmath158@xmath159 mk .",
    "the ionization time scales typically range from @xmath159@xmath160 s and are a function of both temperature and density .",
    "this is comparable to a dynamical time scale and thus we expect the plasma leaving the current sheet to be underionized @xcite .",
    "because the current sheet plasma contains contributions from upstream plasma with different initial temperatures , this may result in a broader charge state distribution than would be expected if there was just one starting temperature .",
    "however , the difference may be small because the time scales to ionize low charge state species will be short in very hot plasma .",
    "differences in the inflow velocities , densities , and temperatures might also lead to observable differences in the non - thermal line widths between the two upstream regions .",
    "in this article , we present resistive mhd simulations of line - tied asymmetric reconnection in the context of solar flare and cme current sheets .",
    "there is asymmetry along the inflow direction because of different upstream densities and magnetic field strengths , and asymmetry along the outflow direction because the initial perturbation is placed near a conducting wall .",
    "the simulations are used to understand the basic physics of asymmetric reconnection and predict observational signatures of asymmetric reconnection in the solar atmosphere .",
    "this approach provides a unified picture of how asymmetry in the reconnection process impacts flare emissions and cme evolution .    as in previous simulations of asymmetric outflow reconnection",
    ", the x - line is generally located near the lower base of the current sheet . consequently , the outflow velocity in the unobstructed direction is significantly faster than the outflow velocity in the obstructed direction .",
    "the slow downflows occur in simulations for two reasons .",
    "first , the downflows impact a region of strong magnetic and plasma pressure , thus slowing them down .",
    "second , the principal x - line is often located near the lower base of the current sheet so that the downward tension force is much weaker compared to the upward tension force . downflowing loops in flare / cme current sheets",
    "are frequently observed to propagate at velocities several times slower than the alfvn speed @xcite , in contrast to symmetric models of reconnection that predict bidirectional alfvnic jets .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational analysis techniques such as those by @xcite that constrain the position of the reconnection flow reversal are important for resolving the problem of slow downflows .",
    "we do note that there are observations of fast downflows during some reconnection events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in simulations with asymmetric upstream magnetic fields , we find that the post - flare loops are skewed when compared to cases with symmetric inflow .",
    "the loop - tops are not directly above each other ; rather , the positions of the loop - tops are a function of height . the observed shape of these loops is reminiscent of a candle flame .",
    "the structure of near - potential loops close to the field reversal along the lower boundary are approximately given by our analytic solution in section [ analytic ] .",
    "cuspy post - flare loops with an apparent candle flame structure have been observed during many events @xcite .",
    "observations showing such behavior would allow us to diagnose or place limits on the asymmetry in the upstream magnetic fields .",
    "however , 3d geometry and projection effects would need to be considered carefully because they could also contribute to a skewed post - flare loop appearance ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the morphological features associated with line - tied asymmetric reconnection grow preferentially into the weak magnetic field upstream region . unlike in cases with symmetric inflow , there is net vorticity in the outflow plasmoid because the reconnection outflow jet impacts it obliquely .",
    "this result suggests that cme current sheets could drive a circulation pattern in erupting flux ropes when viewed in cross - section for events where the current sheet is offset from the direction of flux rope motion .",
    "the x - line retreats away from the obstructing wall in all simulations where it is present ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while generally staying near the lower base of the current sheet .",
    "the exception is case f with a strong guide field which shows that the x - line becomes located near the top exit of the current sheet .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during simulations with symmetric upstream magnetic fields but asymmetric upstream densities ,",
    "the x - line does not drift significantly along the inflow direction .    for each simulation",
    "we find that the plasma flow velocity at the x - line is substantially different from the time derivative of the x - line s position .",
    "any difference between these two velocities must be due to resistive diffusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the exception of the guide field and symmetric outflow cases",
    ", the x - line retreats along the outflow direction against the flow of the plasma .",
    "this occurs because diffusion of the inflow component of the magnetic field along the inflow direction is able to shift the x - line position @xcite . during reconnection with asymmetric inflow ,",
    "the inflow component of plasma velocity at the x - line is in the same direction as the time derivative of the x - line position along the inflow direction .",
    "however , the plasma flow velocity is much faster than the rate of change in position of the x - line along the inflow direction",
    ". consequently , one must be careful when converting simulations to the reference frame of the x - line because the plasma flow velocity will likely be different .    while our simulations provide significant insight into the basic physics and observational consequences of line - tied asymmetric reconnection in the solar atmosphere , it is important to note the limitations of our models .",
    "most noticeably , @xmath150 is larger in the simulations than in most of the corona .",
    "because the simulations start from a perturbed initial equilibrium , total pressure balance is enforced along the inflow direction by increasing plasma pressure on the weak magnetic field side .",
    "it is difficult to maintain a large asymmetry in low-@xmath150 plasmas .",
    "the asymmetries in the simulations are probably more extreme than in the solar atmosphere .",
    "we speculate that magnetic field asymmetries of @xmath1@xmath159@xmath161% are common , with differences of perhaps @xmath162@xmath146% possible in more extreme cases .",
    "the assumption of an initial equilibrium is also questionable since cmes are non - equilibrium events .",
    "the simulations do not include radiative cooling , coronal heating ( except for viscous and ohmic heating ) , or initial vertical stratification of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the outer conducting wall boundary conditions will affect the results on long time scales by additional line - tying as well as pileup of reconnection exhaust .",
    "the lundquist numbers in our simulations are @xmath163@xmath164 so our current sheets are below the @xmath165 threshold for the onset of the plasmoid instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
