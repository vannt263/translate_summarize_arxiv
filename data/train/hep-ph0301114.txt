    "the experiment @xcite is currently running at canada s national laboratory triumf . it is going to measure the muon decay spectrum  @xcite with the accuracy level of about @xmath0 .",
    "that will make a serious test of the space ",
    "time structure of the weak interaction .",
    "the experiment is able to put stringent limits on a bunch of parameters in models beyond the standard model ( sm ) , _",
    "e.g. _ , on the mass and the mixing angle of a possible right  handed @xmath1-boson . to confront the experimental results with the sm",
    ", adequately accurate theoretical predictions should be provided .",
    "this requires to calculate radiative corrections within the perturbative quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . here",
    "we will present analytical results for two specific contributions related to radiation of virtual and soft real electron ",
    "positron pairs .",
    "the corrections under consideration are of the order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the fine structure constant .    the contributions of virtual @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and hadronic pairs were found  @xcite to be small compared with the @xmath0 precision tag of the modern experiments .",
    "the contribution of @xmath6 pairs is enhanced by powers of the large logarithm @xmath7 .",
    "analysis of the leading and next  to  leading terms from this correction in refs .",
    "@xcite has shown that the numerical effect is not as small as for other leptonic flavors , and it should be taken into account .",
    "comparison of the leading and next  to  leading contributions revealed a poor convergence of the series in @xmath8 .",
    "calculation of the terms without the large logarithm was found to be desirable .    within the standard model , the differential distribution of electrons ( summed over electron spin states ) in the polarized muon decay",
    "can be represented as [ general ] & & = _ 0 , _ 0 = , + & & c = , x = , x_0 x 1 , x_0 = , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the muon and electron masses ; @xmath11 is the fermi coupling constant ; @xmath12 is the angle between the muon polarization vector @xmath13 and the electron ( or positron ) momentum ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the energy and the energy fraction of @xmath16 .",
    "here we adopt the definition of the fermi coupling constant following ref .",
    "functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 describe the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the spectrum , respectively . within perturbative qed",
    ", they can be expanded in series in @xmath3 : f(x ) = f_(x ) + f_1(x ) + ( ) ^2f_2(x ) + ( ) ^3f_3(x ) + , and in the same way for @xmath18 . among different contributions into the functions",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , there are ones related to the production of electron  positron pairs . in this letter",
    "we will consider the effect of soft and virtual @xmath6 pairs .",
    "the process of real pair production does nt reveal any infrared singularity , contrary to the case of photon radiation .",
    "nevertheless , a separate consideration of soft pair emission can be of interest .",
    "in fact , @xmath6 pairs with energy below a certain threshold ca nt be observed in experiments with muons decaying at rest .",
    "so , the corresponding contribution is a specific correction to the measured decay spectrum .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the real pair emission in the soft limit is not smooth .",
    "an integration over the domain between the threshold of real pair production and a certain cut on the maximal energy of the soft pair is desirable .",
    "the maximal energy of the soft pair is defined by the parameter @xmath19 , which is assumed to be large compared with the electron mass : [ esoft ] e _ , 1 .    due to the smallness of the pair component energies , the matrix element @xmath20 of the process ^-(p )",
    "e^-(q )  +  _ ( r_1 )  +  |_e(r_2)+  e^+(p_+ )  +  e^-(p_- ) can be expressed as a product of the matrix element @xmath21 of the hard sub  process ( the non  radiative muon decay ) and the classic accompanying radiation factor : m = m_0 |v(p_+)^u(p_-)j _ , k = p_+ + p_- , where @xmath22 are the momenta of the positron and electron from the created pair .",
    "the radiation factor reads j _ = - .    performing the covariant integration of the summed over spin states modulus of the matrix element over the pair components momenta",
    ", we obtain @xmath23 it is convenient to parameterize the phase volume of the total pair momentum as @xmath24 where a trivial integration over the azimuthal angle can be performed : @xmath25 .",
    "now i integrate over the total pair momentum with the condition  ( [ esoft ] ) @xmath26 . in this way i got the following result for the soft pair contribution : [ sp ] & & = ^ , = _ 0 + , + & & f_0(x ) = x^2(3 - 2x ) , g_0(x ) = x^2(1 - 2x ) , + & & ^ = , + & & a = l+2 , ( n ) = _ k=1^ , ( 2 ) = .",
    "so we calculated explicitly all the terms in @xmath27 except the ones suppressed by the small factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we will use here the substitution suggested by j.  schwinger for the photon propagator ( with 4momentum @xmath30 ) corrected by a one  loop vacuum polarization insertion : [ schwinger ] & & _ 0 ^ 1 , m^2= , + & & ( v)= - ( 1-v^2)(2-v^2 ) , where @xmath31 is the mass of the fermion in the loop .    the standard technique of integration over feynman parameters can be used here .",
    "we are interested in the region of electron energy fractions @xmath32 .",
    "analytical expressions for the relevant integrals in this region are given in appendix a. as concerning the region of small electron energy fractions @xmath33 , it requires a more accurate treatment .",
    "but the differential width there is rapidly decreasing ( see _ i.e. _ the born  level functions in eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) ) , and the contribution of this region into the total width is suppressed by the mass ratio squared .    formally , we have an ultraviolet singularity in the virtual pair correction . the fermi theory is not renormalizable in the general case .",
    "but for the muon decay everything is safe , since the standard renormalization of the electron and muon wave functions removes the singularity  @xcite .",
    "note that we need to use here only the pair contribution into the renormalization constants .",
    "they can be found easily from the calculation of the virtual pair corrections to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 vertexes ( see appendix b ) , where we had & & - 2v_e(0 ) , - 2v_(0 ) , + & & v_(0 ) = - l^2 + l - - ( 2 ) , v_e(0 ) = - + ( 2 ) , where @xmath36 is the ultraviolet cut  off ; see appendix  a for quantities @xmath37 . for the muon decay we use _ half a sum _ of the above substitutions : & & + - v_(0 ) - v_e(0 ) .",
    "the same logic was applied for renormalization of one  loop corrections to muon decay  @xcite .",
    "i got the following result for the virtual @xmath6 pair contribution : = _ 0 ( ) ^2 , where [ virtp ] & & f_2,^(e^+e^-)(x ) = f_0(x ) w(x ) - 2x^2x l - 2x^2 ^ 2x - 2x^2 + & & + 7x^2x +",
    "xx + x - x , + & & g_2,^(e^+e^-)(x ) = g_0(x ) w(x ) - x^2x l - x^2 ( + ^2x ) + & & + x^2x - xx - x + x , + & & w(x ) = - l^3 + ( - x ) l^2 + ( - - ^2x + & & + x - ( 2 ) - ) l - + + + & & - ^3x - x + ^2x - ( 2)x - x + & & + ( 3 ) + ( 2 ) + , + & & - _ 0^xy , _ 0^xy , + & & _ 0^xy .",
    "it is worth to note that the sub  leading virtual corrections do nt factorize before the born functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "by integration over the energy fraction and the angle we receive the corresponding contribution to the total muon width : [ gvp ] ^ & = & _ -1 ^ 1c _ 0 ^ 1x = _ 0()^2 - 5.049710",
    "this quantity was calculated earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite by numerical integration using dispersion relations : ^([10 ] ) - 5.1326 10 ^ -5 _ 0 , which is close but different from my number .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "at least part of the difference can be due to terms proportional to @xmath40 , which were omitted in my calculation .",
    "the correction to the forward  backward asymmetry of the decay can be found also : ^ _ & = & _ 0 ^ 1x = _ 0()^2 - 1.1710 ^ -5 _ 0 .",
    "the relative effect of the soft pair correction depends only on the cut value .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:1 ] .",
    "the soft pair approximation  ( [ esoft ] ) is not valid for values of @xmath19 close to the threshold of real pair production and for large @xmath41 .",
    "but it can be used there as a simple estimate .",
    "so , by taking @xmath42 we make an estimate of the order of magnitude of the total contribution due to real @xmath6 pairs ( here the estimate is about two times the true value ) .",
    "for very small values of @xmath19 the correction should vanish in any case , so the approximation is really safe there .",
    "let us define the relative contribution of the virtual @xmath6 pair corrections in the form ^(x ) = ( ) ^2 .",
    "the dependence of this function on the electron energy fraction is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure:2 ] in different approximations for @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath45 is very weak , because the main part of the correction is factorized before the born  level functions and cancels out in the ratio .",
    "the leading logarithmic ( ll ) approximation takes into account only the terms of the order @xmath46 , the next  to  leading logarithmic ( nll ) approximation includes also the @xmath47 terms , and the next  to  next  to  leading approximation ( nnl ) represents the complete result .",
    "the third power of the large logarithm cancels out in the sum of the virtual and soft pair contributions : = _ 0 ( ) ^2 , where f_2,^(e^+e^-)(x ) & = & f_0(x ) u(x ) - 2x^2x l - 2x^2 ^ 2x - 2x^2 + & - & x + xx + 7x^2x + x , + g_2,^(e^+e^-)(x ) & = & g_0(x ) u(x ) - x^2x l - x^2 ^ 2x - x^2 + & + & x - xx + x^2x - x , + u(x ) & = & ( + - x ) l^2 + ( ^2- + & - & - ^2x + x - - ( 2 ) ) l + & + & ^3- ^2- ( 2)+ + & + & - - ^3x - x + & + & + ^2x - ( 2)x - x + & + & + 6(2 ) + 4(3 ) .",
    "i checked that the leading and next  to  leading terms in the above formula agree with the corresponding contribution obtained within the fragmentation function formalism in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this way",
    "we simulate the experimental set  up with a certain energy threshold for registration of pairs , while events with pair production above the threshold ( with several visible charged particles in the final state ) are rejected .    if the radiation of real pairs is completely forbidden by kinematics ( or experimental conditions )",
    ", only the virtual corrections  ( [ virtp ] ) contribute .",
    "that happens , for instance at large values of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , two contributions to the total set of radiative corrections for the muon decay spectrum are presented .",
    "they are required to reach the level of the theoretical accuracy below @xmath49 .",
    "the formulae can be used for semi ",
    "analytical estimates and as a part of a monte carlo code to describe the pair production contribution to the decay spectrum .",
    "the formulae are valid also for pair corrections to leptonic @xmath50-decays .",
    "here we give the list of integrals over feynman parameters , which are relevant for the calculation of the virtual pair correction to the muon decay spectrum ( @xmath51 is assumed ) .",
    "& = & , + & = & , + & = & , + & = & , + & = & , + & = & , + & = & , + & = & , + l_z & & l + 2z .",
    "i used above a short notation for the integral over three feynman variables : f(v , x , y ) = _ 0 ^ 1 _ 0 ^ 1yy_0 ^ 1x f(v , x , y ) , and d & = & y^2p_x^2 + ( 1-y)m^2 , p_x^2 = x^2m_^2 + ( 1-x)^2m_e^2 + bx(1-x ) , + d_&= & y^2m_^2 + ( 1-y)m^2 , d_e = y^2m_e^2 + ( 1-y)m^2 , + b & = & zm_^2(1 + ) , m^2 = , ( v)= - ( 1-v^2)(2-v^2 ) .",
    "using the schwinger substitution  ( [ schwinger ] ) , i reproduced the known  @xcite asymptotic expressions for the @xmath2 virtual pair contributions into the dirac form factor of muon : & & f_1^(4,a)(m_1,m_2,q^2)|_m_1,m_2q^2 = ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 \\ { - l^3 + l^2 + & & - ( + ) l + d ( ) } , + & & d(1 ) = - ( 2 ) , + & & d(0)= + ( 2 ) - ( 3 ) , + & & d(r)|_r 1 = l^3 - l^2 + ( + ) l + - ( 2 ) - ( 3 ) , + & & l , l r = , where @xmath52 is the muon mass ; @xmath31 is the mass of the fermion in the loop ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the muon and fermion charges , respectively ; @xmath55 is the square of the momentum transferred in the spacelike region : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the initial and the final muon four  momenta .",
