    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) of elliptical ( e ) and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies is a log - linear relation between effective radius , surface brightness , and velocity dispersion ( _ e.g. _ djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; jrgensen et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter jfk1996 ) .",
    "its ubiquity in nearby clusters of galaxies has been noted by many investigators ( _ e.g. _ bender et al .",
    "1992 ; jfk1996 ; colless et al .",
    "coefficients in the observed fp differ from those predicted by the virial theorem , and this ` tilt ' implies that mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath7 ) is not a constant for e / s0s but depends to some extent on galaxy properties ( see cappellari et al .",
    "the fp must confront studies showing that the growth of galaxies in clusters involves complex processes like galaxy mergers , cluster mergers , and agn activity ( _ e.g. _ fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; tran et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "if e / s0 galaxies form in a short burst and their stellar populations subsequently evolve passively , one would expect a gradual decrease in @xmath7 with cosmic epoch .",
    "this induces an offset in the fp as a function of redshift , with no change in slope .",
    "however , the tendency of star formation to occur over a longer period in lower - mass galaxies ( _ e.g. _ juneau et al .",
    "2005 ; treu et al .",
    "2005 ) , would be manifest as a steepening of the empirical fp with redshift .",
    "evidence for changes in the slope of the fp are seen in the latest studies of the fp at @xmath8 ( _ e.g. _ holden et al .",
    "2005 ; jrgensen et al .",
    "2006 ) , but this has not been observed at @xmath9 ( _ e.g. _ van dokkum & franx 1996 ; kelson et al .",
    "2000 ; wuyts et al .",
    "2004 ) , most likely because these studies do not probe far enough down the mass function .",
    "the internal scatter of the fp reported at @xmath9 is consistent with that of the coma cluster ( jfk1996 ) .",
    "since scatter in the fp is a reflection of the variation in @xmath7 , this is taken as evidence that cluster e / s0s at a given mass are coeval .    in this letter",
    "we examine the fp in rx  j0142.0 + 2131 , a cluster of galaxies at @xmath10 for differences in slope and internal scatter with respect to that of coma .",
    "we use @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and convert previous work to these values where necessary .",
    "the look - back time to rx  j0142.0 + 2131  in this cosmology is 3.2 gyr .",
    "we presented high  signal - to - noise gmos - n spectroscopy of 43 spectroscopic targets in the field of rx  j0142.0 + 2131  in barr et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter bdjbc ) .",
    "velocity dispersions and line indices for 30 cluster members were derived . we determined that scaling relations between metal indices and velocity dispersion , and the strengths of the 4000  break , are inconsistent with a scenario in which stellar populations form at @xmath15 and evolve passively to look like cluster galaxies at low redshift ( _ i.e. _ without additional star formation and/or merging ) .",
    "stellar populations in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  have @xmath6-element abundance ratios ( @xmath16 $ ] ) which are enhanced by , on average , @xmath17 over coma galaxies .",
    "luminosity - weighted mean ages for galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  are similar to those in coma , _",
    "i.e. _ older than would be expected at @xmath0 .",
    "the cluster velocity dispersion is much larger than its x - ray luminosity or richness suggest . despite this ,",
    "no sign of substructure was found by testing the distribution of spectroscopically - confirmed cluster members in ra , dec,@xmath18 space .",
    "the data reduction and analysis method for the gmos - n spectroscopy was presented in bdjbc . in this letter",
    "we restrict the surface photometry calculations to spectroscopically - confirmed cluster members .",
    "we will present effective radii , mean surface brightnesses and morphological classifications for a larger sample at a later date .",
    "rx  j0142.0 + 2131  was observed with the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on ut 2003 november 01 and 2004 july 03 .",
    "two positions were imaged in the f775w band for 4420s each .",
    "reductions are performed with the pyraf task multidrizzle using the standard procedure .",
    "acs surface photometry is analysed using the two - dimensional fitting program galfit @xcite .",
    "we fit galaxies luminosity profiles as as @xmath19 profiles . background or companion galaxies may influence the derived parameters , so these are fit simultaneously as srsic profiles @xcite .",
    "we also classify galaxies by hubble type using a method analogous to that of smail et al .",
    "magnitudes and surface brightnesses are corrected to rest - frame @xmath1 using f775w magnitudes and gmos colors in a similar way as used in bdjbc .",
    "a complete description of our data , reduction techniques , analysis of potential systematics as well as our method of deriving surface - brightness parameters from the galfit fitting program will be presented in a future paper ( chiboucas et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "twenty - eight spectroscopically - confirmed cluster members were covered by the two acs fields . of these 11 are e , 12 are s0 and the remaining 5 are spirals , irregulars , mergers , or not classifiable .",
    "we estimate the systematic and random errors in the values returned by galfit using monte carlo simulations .",
    "artificial galaxies are generated with galfit and with the iraf routine artdata / mkobjects .",
    "these objects cover the full range of parameter space in magnitude , @xmath20 , axis ratio , and position angle of the rx  j0142.0 + 2131sample .",
    "the srsic index is varied randomly between 2.5 and 5 and we adjust the diskiness / boxiness of each artificial galaxy .",
    "noise is then added to the artificial galaxies which are placed randomly in the acs images and recovered as @xmath19 profiles .",
    "the results of the simulations indicate that @xmath21 derived for the @xmath19 profile is systematically greater than the simulated value by 0.06 dex .",
    "the quantity , @xmath22 , which enters the fp and referred to hereafter as the fundamental plane parameter ( fpp ) , is known to be much less sensitive to the imposition of the @xmath19-law fit ( _ e.g. _ lucey 1997 ) .",
    "the derived fpp is systematically offset from its simulated value by @xmath23 , with a standard deviation of @xmath24 .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation is not a function of the fpp .",
    "we do not make corrections to the surface photometry but quantify the total uncertainty on the fpp as @xmath25 .",
    "our comparison sample consists of 116 e / s0 galaxies in the coma cluster ; velocity dispersions are from jrgensen ( 1999 ) .",
    "we use gunn @xmath26 surface photometry of e / s0 galaxies fit using an @xmath19 law from jrgensen et al . ( 1995 ) , as well as new @xmath27 and @xmath28 photometry obtained with the mcdonald observatory 0.8 m telescope .",
    "we transform from gunn @xmath26 to the rest - frame @xmath1 using @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30 derived for e / s0 galaxies using bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models , a median coma red - sequence color of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 where the @xmath33-correction , @xmath34 , is derived from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models .",
    "the surface brightness parameter in the @xmath1-band fp is @xmath35 .",
    "we recalculate the fp for the coma cluster by minimising the absolute residuals in @xmath36 perpendicular to the plane , following jfk1996 .",
    "three emission - line galaxies are excluded from the fit .",
    "we find @xmath37 with an rms of 0.08 in @xmath38 .",
    "we fit the fp to e / s0 galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  in the same way as for the coma cluster .",
    "emission - line galaxies identified in bdjbc are excluded .",
    "the fp is @xmath39 with an rms of @xmath40 in @xmath21 .",
    "selection effects can be crucial when comparing two samples at varying epochs . as a test",
    "we recalculate the fp in coma and rx  j0142.0 + 2131  for the subsamples with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "there are no significant differences in the coefficients of @xmath43 or @xmath44 , or rms between either the low- or high - redshift sample and its parent sample .    in order to assess the significance of any difference in slope between the coma fp and that of rx  j0142.0 + 2131 , we make @xmath45 random realisations of a high-@xmath18 cluster .",
    "twenty - three galaxies are taken from the coma cluster and scattered so that the rms in @xmath21 is equal to that in rx  j0142.0 + 2131 .",
    "we then fit the fp as described above .",
    "values of the coefficients in the fp are consistent with coma @xmath46 of the time , and consistent with rx  j0142.0 + 2131  @xmath47 of the time .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that there is no strong evidence for a difference in the slope of the fp for rx  j0142.0 + 2131  when compared with coma .",
    "the galaxies from rx  j0142.0 + 2131  are plotted on the coma cluster fp in figure  [ fig : fp1 ] .    even with the imposition of the same mass cutoff at @xmath48 ,",
    "the internal scatter of the points from the fp remains higher for rx  j0142.0 + 2131  than it is for coma ( it actually increases to 0.13 in @xmath21 for rx  j0142.0 + 2131  as opposed to 0.08 in coma ) .",
    "this phenomenon is not seen in previous studies of the fp in clusters at similar redshift ( _ e.g. _ kelson et al . 2000 ; fritz et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the scatter in the fp reflects the variation of @xmath7 within stellar populations , and a high scatter could imply that there are two or more groups of galaxies with different mean values of @xmath7 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fp1 ] we separate galaxies according to e or s0 classification ; the scatter for s0s is higher , 0.12 in @xmath21 compared with 0.10 for es .",
    "we also plot cluster members east of 01h42m06s including the second brightest member as filled boxes ; open boxes are galaxies in the main body of the cluster .",
    "the internal scatter is 0.05 and 0.12 in @xmath21 for the filled points and open points respectively .",
    "observables are converted to mass and @xmath2 via , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , where for @xmath51 in km s@xmath12 , @xmath20 in kpc , and @xmath52 in pc@xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mlr ] shows @xmath55 vs. @xmath56 .",
    "we determine the slope of the @xmath57 vs. @xmath56 diagram for coma and the complete rx  j0142.0 + 2131  sample by minimising absolute residuals perpendicular to the slope .",
    "the slopes are consistent , though the uncertainty for rx  j0142.0 + 2131  is large .",
    "we therefore calculate the offset in @xmath2 ratio for rx  j0142.0 + 2131  by preserving the coma slope and calculating the median offset of the rx  j0142.0 + 2131  galaxies .",
    "this is @xmath58 dex in @xmath2 for the whole sample .",
    "lenticular galaxies have lower average @xmath2 than ellipticals ( 0.06 dex ) , and their scatter in @xmath2 is 0.18 dex as opposed to 0.14 dex .",
    "the offset predicted by the single - stellar population ( ssp ) models of maraston ( 2005 ) with passive evolution and @xmath59@xmath60 is @xmath61 , shown as the dot - dashed line on figure  [ fig : mlr ] .",
    "if the differences in mass - to - light ratio are caused by different luminosity - weighted mean ages of stellar populations , then the maraston models suggest that galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  incurred a major star - formation episode at @xmath62 , making them only @xmath63 gyr old .",
    "this is highly unlikely given the spectroscopic evidence for old stellar populations presented in bdjbc .",
    "the internal scatter of the rx  j0142.0 + 2131  fp is larger than that of coma .",
    "this suggests that galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  have undergone bursts of star formation over a range in epochs .",
    "the fact that the s0 galaxies have lower @xmath2 and larger scatter is consistent with results suggesting they form stars at lower redshift , or are more recent additions to clusters ( _ e.g. _ treu et al .",
    "2003 ; mcintosh et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the eastern galaxies have @xmath2 consistent with passively - evolving stellar populations formed at @xmath59@xmath64 , and their internal scatter is consistent with the coma fp .",
    "they also have a lower fraction of s0s , 1 of 6 rather than 11 of 17 .",
    "this can be explained if the western galaxies have undergone star formation at a more recent epoch than @xmath65 , while the eastern galaxies have yet to interact with the icm , or have not undergone a burst of star formation during their incorporation into the cluster .",
    "in bdjbc we found no evidence for recent star - formation in any cluster e / s0s and no spatial segregation of age - sensitive absorption - line diagnostics .",
    "indeed , we found stellar populations with similar luminosity - weighted mean ages as those in the coma cluster .",
    "this is inconsistent with ages derived from our measured @xmath66 via the maraston models .",
    "a complication is introduced by @xmath16 $ ]  which we found to be enhanced by @xmath17 in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  galaxies and could have a systematic effect on @xmath2 .",
    "if this were the case our data indicate that enhanced @xmath16 $ ]  decreases @xmath2 .",
    "it has been suggested that an enhancement of @xmath6-elements will increase the blue luminosity of a stellar population @xcite , and preliminary models from maraston ( private comm . )",
    "predict @xmath67 is up to @xmath68 higher for young galaxies with solar metallicity and @xmath16 $ ]  @xmath69 .",
    "qualitatively , therefore , the models and data act in the same sense .",
    "we might expect to see this effect as a correlation in residuals from the @xmath70 and the @xmath16$]@xmath71 relations .",
    "no correlation is seen in either coma or rx  j0142.0 + 2131galaxies .",
    "however , the errors on @xmath16 $ ]  derived in bdjbc are relatively large ( @xmath72 of the dynamic range ) , and the effect of age , metallicity , and internal scatter on @xmath57 are not clear .",
    "a more thorough analysis using a larger data set will be required to decouple the effects of these quantities on mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we speculate that the systematically lower @xmath66 in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  is due to a cluster ",
    "cluster merger which must have occurred at @xmath73 .",
    "rapid star formation episodes serve to increase @xmath16 $ ]  and so decrease @xmath66 further .",
    "individual galaxies interact with the cluster at different epochs which introduces a large scatter in the fp .",
    "the imprint of such an interaction should still be clearly visible in the large - scale distribution of gas or galaxies",
    ". a more detailed picture can be painted with high - resolution x - ray imaging or multi - object spectroscopy of @xmath74s of galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131 .    if it is challenging to explain the history of stellar populations in rx  j0142.0 + 2131 , then it is near impossible to imagine an evolutionary path from their position at @xmath0 to the coma cluster .",
    "the @xmath16 $ ]  ratios can be decreased if there is a significant amount of merging between the bright e / s0s and galaxies which have formed their stars over longer periods .",
    "such mergers would have to occur in the 3 gyr available without any star formation to avoid decreasing the @xmath2 further .",
    "we have established the fp for e / s0 galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131 .",
    "there is no evidence that the slope of this fp is different from that of the coma cluster . on average ,",
    "@xmath2 for galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  is @xmath75 dex lower than in the coma cluster .",
    "the internal scatter of the fp in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  is larger than for coma .",
    "this can also be visualised as a larger scatter in mass - to - light ratio for galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131 .",
    "lenticular galaxies have lower average @xmath2 with a larger scatter than es .",
    "spectroscopically - confirmed members east of 01h42m06s , including the second brightest cluster galaxy , have @xmath2 ratios consistent with passively - evolving galaxies formed at @xmath76 and an internal scatter consistent with the coma fp .",
    "the large scatter in the fp can be explained by spatially - segregated galaxies with different average @xmath2 , consistent with galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  having undergone bursts of star formation over a range in epochs .",
    "this effect is not evident when looking at age - sensitive absorption line indices .",
    "however , galaxies in rx  j0142.0 + 2131  have enhanced @xmath16 $ ]  which might serve to push any putative star formation episode to higher redshift .",
    "if this were the case our data suggest that increased @xmath16 $ ]  acts to reduce @xmath2 . improved modeling of the effect of age and @xmath16 $ ]  on @xmath2 is required before more accurate statements about star - formation epochs can be made .",
    "we speculate that the large scatter in galaxies @xmath2 is caused by a cluster  cluster merger .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the large cluster velocity dispersion and implies that gaseous or galactic substructure should be detectable with x - ray imaging or spectroscopy of hundreds of cluster galaxies .",
