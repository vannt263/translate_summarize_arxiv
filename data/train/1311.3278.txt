    "at the interface between a normal metal and a superconductor ( sc ) an incoming electron with an energy above the fermi energy ( or chemical potential ) @xmath0 can be reflected back into the metal as a hole with opposite spin orientation .",
    "this phenomenon , known as andreev reflection  @xcite , gives rise to the well - known proximity effect resulting in superconducting properties decaying into the normal metal part of the heterostructure .",
    "replacing the normal metal by a ferromagnet ( fm ) drastically changes the behaviour at the interface . at first sight",
    "the phenomenona of ferromagnetism and superconductivity appear to be mutually exclusive due to the specific requirements concerning spin orientations . in ferromagnetic materials",
    "the pauli principle requires the spins to orient parallel whereas superconducting spin - singlet cooper pairs require an antiparallel orientation .",
    "based on these intrinsic spin orientations there are interesting phenomena to be expected at the interface between a ferromagnet and a superconductor .",
    "the exchange interaction in the ferromagnet leads to different fermi velocities of electrons in the spin - up and spin - down channel .",
    "therefore , the centre of mass motion is modulated and superconducting correlations in the ferromagnet show an oscillating behaviour  @xcite .",
    "these are essentially the fflo oscillations named after fulde and ferrell  @xcite and larkin and ochinikov  @xcite , respectively . the penetration of these spin - singlet superconducting correlations are strongly supressed by the ferromagnetic exchange field and are only short - range .",
    "in addition , the exchange field also generates @xmath1 ( unequal - spin ) components of spin - triplet correlations , which also oscillate and decay .",
    "similar to the spin - singlet correlations these are short - range as well .",
    "however , it has been suggested theoretically by bergeret _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , that due to spin - flip processes at the interface equal - spin spin - triplet cooper pairs can form which should be unaffected by the ferromagnetic exchange field thereby allowing much larger penetration depths .",
    "this phenomenon is called the long - range proximity effect and has triggered a lot of experimental and theoretical work . the proximity effect in superconductor - ferromagnet heterostructures is reviewed by buzdin  @xcite , whereas bergeret _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite review the physics behind this type of `` odd - triplet '' superconductivity .",
    "the symmetry relations between the different pairing correlations within the superconductor - ferromagnet heterostructures is discussed in detail by eschrig  _ et al . _",

    "several multilayer setups have been suggested to observe spin - triplet proximity effect , but so far there exist only indirect proofs of the generation of spin - triplet supercurrents through the observation of supercurrents in josephson junctions  @xcite or spin - valves  @xcite .",
    "typical examples of multilayer systems to generate spin - triplet cooper pairs experimentally involve noncollinear magnetisations within the different ferromagnetic layers  @xcite , or helical ( or conical ) magnets in the multilayer setup  @xcite .",
    "this is accompanied by respective theoretical investigations of those sytems containing noncollinear magnetisations  @xcite and helical ( or conical ) magnetic material in the multilayer setup  @xcite . additionally , also",
    "the effects of bloch  @xcite or nel  @xcite domain walls , spin - orbit coupling  @xcite or specific interface potentials  @xcite at the sc / fm interface on the generation of spin - triplet cooper pairs have been investigated theoretically .",
    "another route towards generating spin - triplet cooper pairs leads to the inclusion of half - metallic ferromagnets such as cro@xmath2 into the heterostructures  @xcite which would pave the way for a marriage between supercurrents and spintronics applications  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the paper is as follows . a heterostructural setup similar to those used in the experiments of robinson _ et al .",

    "one focus of the work lies on the influence of the conical magnet s opening and turning angles on the induced spin - triplet pairing correlations for which a detailed symmetry analysis will be provided .",
    "secondly , we focus on the influence of conical magnetic layer thickness on the spin - triplet correlations .",
    "it will be shown that a minimum number of conical magnetic layers are necessary to efficiently generate equal - spin spin - triplet correlations , in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows",
    ". starts with a description of the theoretical method , namely the self - consistent solution of the spin - dependent bdg equations .",
    "this is followed by a detailed description of the multilayer structure used in the calculations , a setup for the conical magnetic structure , and finally the spin - dependent pairing correlations .",
    "results are presented in , where first a symmetry analysis of different conical magnet orientations is presented followed by the conical magnet s and ferromagnet s thickness dependence of the spin - dependent triplet pairing correlations .",
    "a concluding summary and an outlook will be given in .",
    "all our calculations are based on self - consistent solutions of the microscopic bdg equations which for the spin - dependent case read  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 denote the eigenvalues of the matrix equation , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the quasiparticle and quasihole amplitudes for spin @xmath8 , respectively .",

    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are electronic creation and destruction operators at layer index @xmath16 with momentum @xmath17 within the layers , respectively . since the main focus of the present work lies on the presence of an interface within the multilayer or heterostructure , the only valid @xmath18 values in are to be found within the interface plane . for each of these @xmath18 values",
    "the bdg equations leads to a one - dimensional inhomogeneous problem in the layer index @xmath16  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity and since this would only lead to a parametrical dependence of the hamiltonian on a discretised @xmath18 mesh in the present work we neglect this @xmath18 dependence .",
    "then simplifies to @xmath19 the implications of this simplification will be taken into account when discussing the obtained results in .",

    "looking for the moment at the right fm / cm interface ( ( a ) ) and assuming the ferromagnetic moments to orient along the @xmath64 axis , the conical magnetic moment closest to the interface can have two different antiferromagnetic - like orientations , namely pointing slightly towards the fm side ( @xmath65 case , with the cone opening into the fm layer ) or slightly towards the cm side of the interface ( @xmath66 case , with the cone opening away from the fm layer ) .",
    "these angles are reversed at the left cm / fm interface , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the handedness of the respective cone is determined not only by the turning angle @xmath67 ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) but also influenced by the respective opening angle .",
    "looking again at the right fm / cm interface and an opening angle @xmath66 ( cone opening away from the fm layer ) a turning angle @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) describes a clockwise ( counterclockwise ) rotation of the conical magnetic structure . if , however , the opening angle amounts to @xmath65 ( cone opening into the fm layer ) , a turning angle @xmath70 ( @xmath69 ) again describes a clockwise ( counterclockwise ) rotation but now viewed along the @xmath72 direction .",
