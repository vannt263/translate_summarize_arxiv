    "one of the many advantages of looking to the high - redshift universe is the red - shifting of the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) emission into the optical observational regime , allowing us to access the unique physics that can be probed using the uv emission or absorption lines .    in this paper",
    "we examine the ultraviolet cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 flux ratio as a diagnostic of the excitation of extended narrow - line emitting gas associated with active galactic nuclei .",
    "our interest in this flux ratio was initially motivated by the need for indicators of electron temperature ( t@xmath3 ) in the rest - frame uv spectral region , to be used with high - z galaxies for which the rest - frame optical temperature diagnostics ( i.e. , [ oiii ] @xmath14363 / [ oiii ] @xmath15007 ) have been red - shifted out of the optical observational regime .",
    "the large difference in excitation energies of the two cii lines ( 9.3 vs 5.3 ev ) makes their flux ratio strongly sensitive to t@xmath3 , and hence the flux ratio potentially offers a means to determine t@xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the use of lines from a singly - ionized species ought to make this diagnostic readily accessible for both high- and low - excitation objects , agn and star - forming objects , alike ( cf",
    ". the [ neiv ] , [ nev ] and oiii ] high - ionization temperature diagnostics discussed by humphrey et al .",
    "2008 : h08 hereinafter ) .    in @xmath4  [ cii_prob ]",
    "we discuss the observational data used in this paper : the cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 flux ratio in type 2 , radio - loud quasars at z@xmath02.5 .",
    "these data are compared against different excitation models in @xmath4  [ models ] , and in @xmath4  [ ngc1068 ]   we discuss the case of the narrow line region of the nearby seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 , which has been extensively observed at uv wavelengths . in @xmath4  [ disc ]   we summarize and discuss our findings , and in appendix a1 , we give a subset of the exploratory grid of models , using @xmath2-distributed electron energies , that were computed during the preparation of this paper ; the full grid has been made available online .",
    "for this investigation we use line fluxes from the spectropolarimetric study of 9 radio - loud type 2 quasars ( also known as radio galaxies ) , at z@xmath02.5 published by vernet et al .",
    "( 2001 : v01 ) . of those 9 galaxies ,",
    "v01 detected 5 of them in both cii @xmath11335 and cii ] @xmath12326 .",
    "the fluxes and line ratios of these two lines are listed in table  [ cii_obs ] . where both lines have been measured , the cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 flux ratio occupies the range 0.18@xmath50.02 - 0.48@xmath50.07 .",
    "as has been shown in several previous studies , the uv - optical emission line ratios measured from the narrow line emitting nebulae associated with high redshift type 2 quasars can , in general , be well reproduced using photoionization models that use roughly solar gas metallicity , and an ionizing spectrum defined by a power - law of @xmath6 ( e.g. , villar - martn et al .",
    "1997 , v01 , h08 ) .",
    "these models traditionally assume a maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium distribution ( mbed hereinafter ) of electron energies in the ionized plasma .    as a starting point , we compute a sequence of models with the above parameters using the photoionization code mappings 1e ( binette , dopita & tuohy 1985 ; ferruit et al .",
    "1997 ; binette et al .",
    "we adopted a plane - parallel , single - slab geometry with a constant hydrogen density of 100 @xmath7 .",
    "each model computation was terminated when the hydrogen ionization fraction fell below 1 per cent of its maximum .",
    "the ionization parameter u was varied along the model sequence from 1@xmath810@xmath9 to 0.20 . in this solar - metallicity model sequence ,",
    "the maximum value for the cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 flux is 0.11 , occurring at u@xmath00.01 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_models1 ] ) .",
    "this is a factor of 3 lower than the observed mean value ( table  [ cii_obs ] ) , showing that the canonical agn photoionization models for the extended narrow line emitting gas fail to adequately reproduce the observed cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 ratios .",
    "we note that the models also under predict the ratio of cii @xmath11335 relative to several other lines , including ly@xmath10 , by a similar factor .",
    "furthermore , the low ionization resonant lines siii @xmath11265 and siii @xmath11309 are similarly under predicted relative to cii ] @xmath12326 and ly@xmath10 .",
    "however , these particular line ratios are additionally subject to relative chemical abundance effects , and hence do not provide as strong a diagnostic power as the cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 ratio . for this reason , for the remainder of this paper we will focus on the cii ratio .",
    "while the cii ratio is also sensitive to reddening by dust , any de - reddening would result in an even larger discrepancy between the model and observed cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 ratios .",
    "we also point out that the cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 flux ratio is essentially insensitive to the c / h abundance ratio .",
    "next , we investigate whether sub - solar metallicity ( @xmath11 hereinafter ) in the photoionized gas can help to explain the cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 ratios .",
    "we have repeated the above photoionization calculations , to obtain model sequences at @xmath12 of 0.5 , 0.25 and 0.1 .",
    "all metals were scaled linearly from solar abundances except for nitrogen , which we scaled quadratically ( n / o @xmath13 o / h ; see e.g. henry , edmunds & kppen 2000 ; vernet et al .",
    "2001 ) from its solar abundance down to @xmath12=0.25 , below which we scaled linearly ( n / h @xmath13 o / h ) .",
    "we find that decreasing the gas metallicity yields higher cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 ratios , due to the increase in electron temperature as cooling via emission lines becomes less efficient at lower @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , using sub - solar metallicity allows the observed flux ratios to be reproduced ( fig .",
    "[ fig_models1 ] ) .",
    "while the degeneracy between @xmath11 and u makes it difficult to obtain a precise value of @xmath11 for each object , we can nonetheless use the maximum value of cii @xmath11335 / cii ] @xmath12326 at a given @xmath11 to obtain an upper limit on metallicity @xmath11 .",
    "the observed values of the line ratio require @xmath140.25 , the exception being txs 0828 + 193 , for which we estimate @xmath140.8",
    ". taken at face value , such low gas metallicities are at odds with the values @xmath151 for several of these type 2 quasars , as estimated in previous studies using the nitrogen lines such as nv @xmath11240 or [ nii ] @xmath16583 ( see v01 and h08 ) ."
