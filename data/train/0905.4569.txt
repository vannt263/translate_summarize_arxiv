    "in many physical systems with discrete symmetry the anisotropy of the interface tension can play an important role for various phenomena , including equilibrium droplet shapes  @xcite and the interfacial roughening transition  @xcite . for sufficiently strong anisotropy",
    ", facets , edges , or even corners can be identified in the equilibrium droplet shape . due to the anisotropy of the interface tension in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising model ,",
    "the shape of the equilibrium droplet at some finite temperature is not spherical and has , in principle , to be determined by the wulff construction  @xcite . since the 3d ising model with nearest - neighbour interaction is not exactly solvable , no analytical results are available for the interfacial free energy and the wulff construction",
    "can only be done using an effective model of the angle - depending interface tension . only for temperatures not too far below the critical temperature one can use the spherical approximation and , therefore ,",
    "it is important to know how large the anisotropy is for a given temperature .    whereas a lot of numerical results are available for the planar @xmath0 interface tension of the simple cubic ising model , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , there are only a few results in the literature for the @xmath1 interface  @xcite and , to our knowledge , there are no results at all for the @xmath2 interface .    the layout of the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ planar ] we discuss the results for the planar @xmath0 interface and compare our results with previous estimates in the literature .",
    "next we describe in sec .",
    "[ tilt ] first the special boundary conditions employed for the simulation of the tilted interfaces with @xmath1 and @xmath2 orientation and then discuss the results of our finite - size scaling analysis . finally , in sec .  [ summary ]",
    "we conclude with a summary of our main findings .",
    "we considered the ising model on @xmath3 simple cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions to simulate systems with planar @xmath0 interfaces , for various temperatures below the ising transition at @xmath4  @xcite . for",
    "a typical configuration see fig .",
    "[ fig : s100 ] .      the interface tension can be measured using a multimagnetical ( flat in the distribution of the magnetization @xmath6 ) simulation combined with parallel tempering  @xcite , the result of which is after appropriate reweighting to the canonical ensemble a double - peaked magnetization density @xmath7 .",
    "we simulated @xmath8 replica of the system at different inverse temperatures @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "a planar interface of the 3d ising model exhibits a transition at the roughening temperature  @xcite @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , above which the surface stiffness for the @xmath0 interface is finite and below which it is infinite .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the temperature range above this transition , i.e. @xmath14 for all @xmath15 . to construct the weight function for the multimagnetic part of the algorithm , we employed an accumulative recursion , described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "statistical averages were taken over runs of @xmath16 monte carlo ( mc ) steps , where one mc step consists of one full multimagnetical lattice sweep for all 26 replica and one attempted parallel tempering exchange of all adjacent replica .",
    "the interface tension @xmath17 can be estimated according to refs .",

    "therefore , the finite - volume estimator is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the power of @xmath26 in the prefactor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fs ] ) is a delicate problem and the knowledge of the pre - exponential behaviour fixes one free parameter of the fit . using the capillary wave approximation  @xcite the exponent @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 for @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we performed finite - size scaling fits according to @xmath29 and , to allow for higher - order corrections , also to @xmath30    we performed simulations for various lattice sizes ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_m_s100 ] we show the magnetization density @xmath7 for @xmath5 , where the strip configurations , corresponding to the minimum between the two peaks , are suppressed by more than 175 orders of magnitude for the largest system and this suppression becomes even more pronounced for lower temperatures .",
    "such unlikely configurations would not be a problem for a multimagnetical algorithm , but between the strip configuration and the droplet configuration there is an exponentially large barrier  @xcite that might not be overcome during the equilibration phase .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to use the combined algorithm to overcome this barrier .",
    "a similar reasoning applies to the evaporation / condensation transition which is another hidden albeit weaker barrier in the multimagnetical system  @xcite .    for every system",
    "the maximum and minimum probability @xmath22 and @xmath20 were read off , and by repeating the simulations @xmath33 times the statistical error bars were obtained . for @xmath5 and @xmath34 the resulting values for @xmath35",

    "the goodness - of - fit parameter was well above @xmath39 , which we chose as cutoff value .",
    "nevertheless , not yet reaching a constant value for @xmath17 led us to include one more parameter in our fits , @xmath40 performing fits with this ansatz and again varying the lower fit bound systematically , the resulting values for the planar interface tension @xmath17 stay almost constant for reasonable fits ( @xmath41 ) , as one can see in the right panel of fig .",
