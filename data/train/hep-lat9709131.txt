    "besides conventional hadrons , qcd suggests the existence of states containing gluonic excitations , such as glueballs and hybrid hadrons .",
    "although conventional hadrons are reasonably well described by the constituent quark model , states with excited glue are still poorly understood . as experiments begin to focus on the search for glueballs and hybrid mesons , a better understanding of these states from theory is needed . due to the highly nonperturbative nature of the gluonic excitations in these states , lattice simulations offer at present the best means of theoretically probing glueballs and hybrid mesons .",
    "a great advantage in studying hybrid mesons comprised of heavy quarks is that such systems can be studied not only by direct numerical simulation , but also using the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) expansion . in this approach ,",
    "the hybrid meson is treated analogous to a diatomic molecule : the slow heavy quarks correspond to the nuclei and the fast gluon field corresponds to the electrons@xcite .",
    "first , one treats the quark @xmath0 and antiquark @xmath1 as spatially - fixed colour sources and determines the energy levels of the glue as a function of the @xmath2 separation @xmath3 ; each of these energy levels defines a potential @xmath4 adiabatically .",
    "the quark motion is then restored by solving the schrdinger equation in each of these static potentials .",
    "conventional quarkonia arise from the lowest - lying static potential ; hybrid quarkonium states emerge from the excited potentials . once the static potentials have been determined ( via lattice simulations )",
    ", it is a simple matter to determine the complete conventional and hybrid quarkonium spectrum in the leading born - oppenheimer ( lbo ) approximation .",
    "this is a distinct advantage over meson simulations which yield only the very lowest - lying states , often with large statistical uncertainties .    here , we present results for the spectrum of gluonic excitations in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair .",
    "some of these potentials have been studied before@xcite .",
    "this study is the first to comprehensively survey the spectrum in su(3 ) gauge theory . due to our use of anisotropic lattices and an improved action ,",
    "we have been able to determine the static potentials for much larger values of @xmath2 separation than previously studied .",
    "using our potentials , we also determine the hybrid quarkonium spectrum .",
    "results from a preliminary nonrelativistic lattice qcd simulation are also presented .",
    "the first step in the born - oppenheimer expansion is the determination of the rich spectrum of energy levels of the gluons in the presence of the quark and antiquark , fixed in space some distance @xmath3 apart . at this point in the approximation ,",
    "the quark and antiquark simply act as static colour sources .",
    "the gluonic energies ( or static potentials ) may be labelled by the magnitude ( denoted by @xmath5 ) of the projection of the total angular momentum of the gluons onto the molecular axis , by the sign of this projection ( chirality or handedness ) , and by the behaviour under the combined operations of charge conjugation and spatial inversion about the midpoint between the quark and the antiquark .",
    "states with @xmath6 are typically denoted by the capital greek letters @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "states which are even ( odd ) under the above - mentioned parity  charge - conjugation operation are denoted by the subscripts @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the energy of the gluons is unaffected by reflections in a plane containing the molecular axis ; since such a reflection interchanges states of opposite handedness , such states must necessarily be degenerate ( @xmath5 doubling ) .",
    "however , this doubling does not apply to the @xmath10 states ; @xmath10 states which are even ( odd ) under a reflection in a plane containing the molecular axis are denoted by a superscript @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the low - lying levels are labelled @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and so on . for convenience",

    "the quark and antiquark were fixed at lattice sites a distance @xmath3 apart .",
    "several paths along the links of the lattice connecting the quark and the antiquark were then chosen , and our gluonic operators @xmath28 were defined as linear combinations of the path - ordered exponentials of the gauge field along these paths .",
    "examples of these paths are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ops ] .",
    "the linear combinations were chosen such that the operators transformed irreducibly under all symmetry operations . to reduce the mixings of our operators with excited states ,",
    "the gluonic operators were constructed from iteratively - smeared spatial links .",
    "we used the single - link smearing algorithm described in ref .",
    "the quark and antiquark then evolved in time , remaining fixed at their original spatial locations . to reduce statistical noise ,",
    "the static quark propagators , which are simply temporal wilson lines , were constructed from thermally - averaged temporal links@xcite , whenever possible .",
    "the thermal averaging was done using the pseudo - heat - bath method ( 40 updates ) . at some final time slice @xmath29 ,",

    "various run parameters for the three simulations are given in table  [ table : simparams ] ; other relevant parameters can be found in ref .",
    "we used the improved action described in ref .",
    "our use of anisotropic lattices in which the temporal lattice spacing @xmath32 was much smaller than the spatial spacing @xmath24 was crucial .",
    "configuration ensembles were generated using a mixture of cabibbo - marinari ( cm ) pseudo - heat - bath and su(2 ) subgroup over - relaxation ( or ) methods .",
    "the matrices @xmath31 were reduced in the data fitting phase to single correlators and @xmath33 correlation matrices using the variational method described in ref .",
    "these reduced correlators were fit using a single exponential and a sum of two exponentials in various ranges @xmath34 to @xmath35 of the source - sink separation .",
    "the two - exponential fits were used to check for consistency with the single - exponential fits , and in cases of favourable statistics , to extract the first - excited state energy .",
    "best fit values were obtained using the correlated @xmath36 method .",
    "error estimates were calculated using a @xmath37-point bootstrap procedure .",
    "our results for the static potential and its gluonic excitations are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sigma]-[fig : delta ] . results from the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 runs are shown using solid circles , squares , and triangles , respectively .",
    "the results are expressed in terms of the hadronic scale parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the definition of this parameter and a description of its calculation are given in ref .",
    "the familiar static potential is shown as @xmath13 ; the solid curve is a fit to the data using a coulomb plus linear form @xmath42 .",
    "the curves for all other potentials are fits using @xmath43 . for all @xmath3 studied ,",
    "the first - excited potential is the @xmath18 ; hence , the lowest lying hybrid mesons must emerge from this potential .",
    "as @xmath3 becomes very large , the linearly rising @xmath13 potential suggests that the ground state of the glue may be modelled as a fluctuating tube or string of colour flux ; in this picture , the gluonic excitations are expected to be phonon - like with energy gaps proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "however , it appears that for @xmath3 below about @xmath45 fm , the gluonic spectrum can not be explained in terms of a simple string model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a qcd motivated bag model was successfully used to describe both the @xmath13 and @xmath18 potentials for a large range of @xmath3 . in this picture , the strong chromoelectric fields of the quark and antiquark repel the physical vacuum ( dual meissner effect ) , creating a bubble inside which perturbation theory is applicable . in the ground state ,",
    "the inward pressure on the bubble from the physical vacuum balances the outward chromostatic force in such a way to produce a linearly confining potential .",
    "the addition of one or more gluons into the bag produces the excited potentials ; the kinetic energy of the gluons inside the bubble is a key factor in determining the form of these potentials .",
    "this model has recently been revisited and results ( in the ellipsoidal approximation ) for almost all of the potentials studied here are in remarkable agreement with our findings from the lattice simulations ( see ref .",
    "the next step in the bo expansion is to restore the quark motion by solving the radial schrdinger equation , @xmath46\\ u(r)=0 , \\label{eqn : schrodinger}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the reduced mass , and @xmath49 is the radial wavefunction .",
    "the total angular momentum of the meson is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the sum of the spins of the quark and antiquark , and the orbital factor @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total angular momentum of the glue and @xmath54 is the orbital angular momentum of the quark and antiquark .",
    "in the lbo approximation , the eigenvalues @xmath55 and @xmath56 of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are good quantum numbers .",
    "the centrifugal factor is then written as @xmath59 for the @xmath13 potential , @xmath60 .",
    "for the @xmath18 and @xmath16 potentials , we assumed that the one gluon state was dominant with @xmath61 .",
    "mesonic eigenstates of parity and charge - conjugation are linear combinations of left- and right - handed glue states : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 denote the @xmath65 quantum number of the glue .",
    "then in the lbo approximation , the parity ( p ) and charge conjugation ( c ) of each meson is given in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 according to @xmath68    = 2.95 in    = 2.9 in    the potentials computed from wilson loops in lattice simulations contain the self - energies of the temporal wilson lines .",
    "these self - energy contributions are common to all of the static potentials and must be removed in order to obtain the @xmath4 appearing in eq .",
    "[ eqn : schrodinger ] .",
    "ideally , this can be done by measuring the @xmath13 potential for very small @xmath3 and comparing with the running coulomb law as predicted from perturbation theory . in practice , this is difficult to do .",
    "instead , we fit our results for the @xmath13 potential to the form @xmath42 ; the constant @xmath69 is then our estimate of the self - energy contributions to be removed .",
    "results for the @xmath70 spectrum are shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the scale was set using @xmath71 mev as suggested from nrqcd simulations of @xmath70 and @xmath72 mesons ( see table xx of ref .",
    "the heavy quark mass @xmath73 was tuned in order to reproduce the experimentally - known @xmath74 mass : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the energy of the lowest - lying state in the @xmath13 potential . in the lbo approximation ,",
    "many mesons are degenerate : the @xmath77,@xmath78 @xmath67-waves from the @xmath13 potential are degenerate ; the @xmath79,@xmath80,@xmath81,@xmath82 @xmath83-waves from the @xmath13 potential have equal masses ; states such as @xmath84,@xmath85,@xmath80,@xmath86,@xmath78,@xmath82 from the @xmath18 potential are also degenerate .    below the @xmath87 threshold , the lbo results are in very good agreement with the spin - averaged experimental measurements .",
    "note that these results make use of the quenched potentials ( which ignore the light quarks ) and do not include spin , retardation , and other relativistic effects . above the threshold ,",
    "agreement with experiment is lost , suggesting significant corrections from either the light quarks , relativistic effects , or possibly mixings between the states from the different adiabatic potentials .",
    "note that the mass of the lowest - lying hybrid ( from the @xmath18 potential ) is about 10.8  gev .",
    "hybrid mesons from all other static potentials are significantly higher lying .",
    "above 11 gev , the lbo approximation based on the quenched @xmath88 potentials predicts a very dense population of hybrid states .",
    "the radial probability densities for the @xmath89 and @xmath90 conventional states are compared with that of the lowest - lying @xmath18 hybrid state in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] .",
    "hybrid quarkonium states may also be studied directly in numerical simulations . the nonrelativistic formulation of lattice qcd ( nrqcd)@xcite is a particularly efficient means of carrying out such simulations .",
    "we have recently begun an investigation of the hybrid quarkonium states using a spin - independent version of the lattice nrqcd action .",
    "the action included only a covariant temporal derivative and the leading kinetic energy operator ( with two other operators to remove @xmath91 and @xmath92 errors ) ; relativistic corrections depending on spin , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and higher derivatives were not included .",
    "the action was chosen to correspond as closely as possible to the lbo approximation . in so doing",
    ", our treatments of the hybrid mesons using the born - oppenheimer expansion and using nrqcd simulations differed in primarily two aspects : lattice spacing errors and retardation effects .",
    "the nrqcd simulations included retardation effects since the covariant laplacian of the quark kinetic energy operator was treated exactly .",
    "in contrast , the lbo approximation ignored all retardation effects by keeping only the leading term in the @xmath95 expansion of the covariant laplacian .",
    "a comparison of results from the two approaches should afford a test of the adiabatic approximation .    because the signal - to - noise ratio was expected to be poor and the masses of the hybrid mesons",
    "were expected to be large , it was crucial to use an anisotropic lattice in which the temporal lattice spacing was much smaller than the spatial spacing .",
    "the operators used to calculate the static potentials were incorporated into our nrqcd simulation code .",
    "we constructed large sets of gauge - invariant operators in order to minimize excited - state contamination of our hybrid meson correlators using variational techniques .",
    "we have completed an initial run on a @xmath96 lattice using an aspect ratio @xmath97 ( that is , @xmath98 ) . as the purpose of this run was merely to discover the quality of signal which was possible , the quark mass was not tuned and a value @xmath99 was used .",
