    "the family of houghton groups @xmath0  was introduced by houghton @xcite .",
    "these groups serve as an interesting family of groups , studied by brown @xcite , who described their homological finiteness properties , by rver @xcite , who showed that these groups are all subgroups of thompson s group @xmath1 , and by lehnert @xcite who described the metric for @xmath2 .",
    "lee @xcite described isoperimetric bounds , and de cornulier , guyot , and pitsch @xcite showed that they are isolated points in the space of groups .    here ,",
    "we classify automorphisms and determine the abstract commensurator of @xmath0 .",
    "we also give sharp estimates for the word metric which are sufficient to show that the map from the abstract commensurator to the group of quasi - isometries of @xmath0  is an injection .",
    "let @xmath3 be the set of natural numbers ( positive integers ) and @xmath4 be an integer .",
    "we write @xmath5 for the integers modulo @xmath6 with addition and put @xmath7 .",
    "we interpret @xmath8 as the graph of @xmath6 pairwise disjoint rays ; each vertex @xmath9 is connected to @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , or simply @xmath14 , @xmath15  and @xmath16  if @xmath6 is understood , the full symmetric group , the finitary symmetric group and the finitary alternating group on the set @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the _ houghton group @xmath0 _ is the subgroup of @xmath14  consisting of those permutations that are eventually translations ( of each of the rays ) . in other words ,",
    "the permutation @xmath17 of the set @xmath8 is in @xmath0  if there exist integers @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 such that for all @xmath21 , @xmath22 ; throughout we will use right actions .",
    "note that necessarily the sum of the translations @xmath23 must be zero because the permutation needs of course to be a bijection .",
    "this implies that @xmath24 .    for @xmath25 with @xmath26",
    "let @xmath27 be the element which translates the line obtained by joining rays @xmath28 and @xmath29 , given by @xmath30    we also write @xmath31 instead of @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath33 , as well as @xmath34 , are generating sets for @xmath0  if @xmath35 as we can simply check that the commutator @xmath36=g_0^{-1}g_{1}^{-1}g_0g_{1}$ ] transposes @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the special case of @xmath2 , @xmath39 is redundant as @xmath40 .",
    "further , an additional generator to @xmath41 is required to generate the group ; we choose @xmath42 which fixes all points except for transposing @xmath43 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is now clear that the commutator subgroup of @xmath0  is given by @xmath44 for @xmath35 , we thus have a short exact sequence @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the abelianization homomorphism .",
    "we note that as the sum of all the eventual translations must be zero , we have the last translation is determined by the preceding ones :    @xmath47    we will use the following facts freely throughout this paper , see dixon and mortimer @xcite or scott @xcite .    [ lem_free_facts ] the group @xmath16  is simple and equal to the commutator subgroup of @xmath15 , and @xmath48 .",
    "here we determine the automorphism group of @xmath0 .",
    "first we establish that we have to look no further than @xmath14 .",
    "we let @xmath49 denote the normalizer , in @xmath50 , of the subgroup @xmath51 of @xmath50 .",
    "[ prop_injective ] every automorphism of @xmath0 , @xmath52 , is given by conjugation by an element of @xmath14 , that is to say @xmath53 .    from the above , the finitary alternating group @xmath16  is the second derived subgroup of @xmath0 , and hence characteristic in @xmath0 .",
    "so every automorphism of @xmath0  restricts to an automorphism of @xmath16 . since @xmath54 , this restriction yields a homomorphism @xmath55 and we need to show that it is injective with image equal to @xmath56 .    in order to see this",
    "let @xmath57 be an automorphism .",
    "compose this with an inner automorphism ( of @xmath58 ) so that the result is an ( injective ) homomorphism @xmath59 whose restriction to @xmath16  is trivial .",
    "we let @xmath60 and consider the following six consecutive points @xmath61 of @xmath8 for @xmath62 .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the image of @xmath31 under @xmath64 , and by @xmath65 the @xmath66-cycle of the points @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . using the identities @xmath70 and applying @xmath64 , which is trivial on @xmath16 , we get @xmath71",
    "hence , we must have that @xmath63 maps @xmath72 to @xmath73 , and then also @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "the conclusion is that it maps @xmath76 to @xmath77 . applying a similar argument to all points in the branches @xmath28 and @xmath78",
    ", it follows that @xmath79 , and since @xmath28 was arbitrary , this means that @xmath64 is the identity map .    with lemma  [ lem_free_facts ] in mind we now present the complete description of @xmath80 .    [ thm_aut ] for @xmath81 ,",
    "the automorphism group @xmath80 of the houghton group @xmath0  is isomorphic to the semidirect product @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the symmetric group that permutes the @xmath6 rays .    by the proposition , it suffices to prove that every @xmath84 which normalizes @xmath0  must map @xmath85 to @xmath86 for some @xmath87 and all @xmath88 .    to this end",
    ", we pick @xmath89 and @xmath90 . since @xmath91(@xmath92 is in @xmath0  and maps the point @xmath93 to @xmath94 , these two points must lie on the same ray for all but finitely many @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , @xmath67 and @xmath96 lie on the same ray for all but finitely many @xmath95 , as @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , given a ray , we can choose @xmath17 so that whenever @xmath67 lies on that ray , then @xmath67 and @xmath97 are successors on the same ray . combining these facts ,",
    "we see that @xmath64 maps all but finitely many points of ray @xmath28 to one and the same ray , say ray @xmath29 .",
    "this defines a homomorphism from @xmath80 onto @xmath83 , which is obviously split , since given a permutation of the @xmath6 rays , it clearly defines an automorphism of @xmath98 .",
    "so assume that @xmath64 is now in the kernel of that map , so it does not permute the rays , and take @xmath17 a @xmath99 generator of @xmath98 , i.e. , an infinite cycle inside @xmath58 . then , since conjugating inside @xmath58 preserves cycle types , the element @xmath100 is also a single infinite cycle .",
    "this means that @xmath91 has nonzero translations in only two rays , and these translations are @xmath101 and @xmath102 . for all points in the support of @xmath17 , we have that @xmath103 sends this point into the @xmath28-th ray for all sufficiently large @xmath104",
    ". therefore , as @xmath64 sends almost all points in the @xmath28-th ray into the @xmath28-th ray , the same is true for @xmath105 .",
    "hence @xmath106 is positive , so it must be @xmath107 .",
    "it is quite clear now that @xmath64 translates by an integer in the ray @xmath28 , sufficiently far out .",
    "this finishes the proof since this could be done for any @xmath28 , and hence @xmath108 .",
    "first , we recall that a commensuration of a group @xmath50 is an isomorphism @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are subgroups of finite index in @xmath50 .",
    "two commensurations @xmath112 and @xmath113 of @xmath50 are equivalent if there exists a subgroup @xmath110 of finite index in @xmath50 , such that the restrictions of @xmath112 and @xmath113 to @xmath110 are equal .",
    "the set of all commensurations of @xmath50 modulo this equivalence relation forms a group , known as the ( abstract ) _ commensurator of @xmath50 _ , and is denoted @xmath114 . in this section",
    "we will determine the commensurator of @xmath0 .",
    "for a moment , we let @xmath51 be a subgroup of a group @xmath50 .",
    "the _ relative commensurator of @xmath51 in @xmath50 _ is denoted @xmath115 and consists of those @xmath116 such that @xmath117 has finite index in both @xmath51 and @xmath118 .",
    "similar to the homomorphism from @xmath49 to @xmath119 , there is a homomorphism from @xmath115 to @xmath120 ; its kernel consists of those elements of @xmath50 that centralize a finite index subgroup of @xmath51 .    in order to pin down @xmath121",
    ", we first establish that every commensuration of @xmath0  can be seen as conjugation by an element of @xmath14 , and then characterize @xmath122 .",
    "since a commensuration @xmath112 and its restriction to a subgroup of finite index in its domain are equivalent , we can restrict our attention to the following family of subgroups of finite index in @xmath0 , in order to exhibit @xmath121 .",
    "for every integer @xmath123 , we define the subgroup @xmath124 of @xmath0  by @xmath125    we collect some useful properties of these subgroup first , where + @xmath126 means that @xmath110 is a subgroup of finite index in @xmath111 .",
    "[ lem_finite_index ]    1 .   for every @xmath127 ,",
    "the group @xmath124 coincides with @xmath128 , the subgroup generated by all @xmath129 powers in @xmath0 , and hence is characteristic in @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "+ 3 .   for every finite index subgroup @xmath132 of @xmath0",
    ", there exists a @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "the same is essentially true for the case @xmath135 , except that @xmath136 is always equal to @xmath137 in this case , with the appropriate change in the index .",
    "first we establish ( ii ) .",
    "we know that @xmath138 $ ] is either trivial , when @xmath139 , or an odd permutation .",
    "so the commutator identities @xmath140=[a , c]^b[b , c]$ ] and @xmath141=[a , c][a , b]^c$ ] imply the first part , and the second part follows immediately using the short exact sequence ( [ ses ] ) from section  [ sec_bg ] .    part ( i ) is now an exercise , using that @xmath142 .    in order to show ( iii ) , let @xmath132 be a subgroup of finite index in @xmath0 .",
    "the facts that @xmath16  is simple and @xmath132 contains a normal finite index subgroup of @xmath0 , imply that @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath127 be the smallest even integer such that @xmath144 is contained in the image of @xmath132 in the abelianisation of @xmath0 .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath124 is contained in @xmath132 .    noting that @xmath145",
    ", we now characterize the commensurators of houghton s groups .",
    "[ thm_com ] let @xmath81 .",
    "every commensuration of @xmath0  normalizes @xmath124 for some even integer @xmath127 .",
    "the group @xmath146 is isomorphic to @xmath147 , and @xmath121 is the direct limit of @xmath148 with even @xmath127 under the natural embeddings @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "let @xmath151 .",
    "by lemma  [ lem_finite_index ] , we can assume that @xmath124 is contained in the domain of both @xmath112 and @xmath152 for some even @xmath127 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the image of @xmath124 under @xmath112 .",
    "then @xmath1 has finite index in @xmath0  and so contains @xmath16 , by lemma  [ lem_finite_index ] .",
    "however , the set of elements of finite order in @xmath1 equals @xmath153 $ ] , whence @xmath153={\\ensuremath{{\\mathsf}{falt}}}$ ] , as @xmath16  and @xmath15  are not isomorphic .",
    "this means that the restriction of @xmath112 to @xmath16  is an automorphism of @xmath16 , and hence yields a homomorphism    @xmath154    that @xmath155 is an injective homomorphism to @xmath122 follows from a similar argument to the one in proposition  [ prop_injective ] applied to @xmath156 and six points of the form @xmath157 with @xmath158 . since the centralizer in @xmath14  of @xmath16 , and hence of any finite index subgroup of @xmath0 , is trivial , the natural homomorphism from @xmath122 to @xmath121 mentioned above is also injective , and we conclude that @xmath121 is isomorphic to @xmath122 , and that @xmath155 is the isomorphism : @xmath159    from now on , we assume that @xmath160 . in particular , the action of @xmath112 is given by conjugation , and our hypothesis is that @xmath161 .",
    "now we can apply the argument from the proof of theorem  [ thm_aut ] to @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( instead of @xmath91 ) .",
    "namely , consider the @xmath164 ray , and choose a @xmath165 .",
    "so we have @xmath166 , @xmath167 and zero translation elsewhere . now , except for finitely many points , @xmath163 preserves the rays and sends @xmath168 to @xmath169 .",
    "thus there is an infinite subset of the @xmath164 ray which is sent to the same ray by @xmath112 , say ray @xmath104 .",
    "the infinite subset should be thought of as a union of congruence classes modulo @xmath127 , except for finitely many points .",
    "we claim that no infinite subset of ray @xmath29 can be mapped by @xmath112 to ray @xmath104 .",
    "this is because , if it were , the infinite subset would contain a congruence class modulo @xmath127 ( except for finitely many points ) from which we would be able to produce two points , @xmath170 , in the support of @xmath163 such that all sufficiently large positive powers of @xmath163 send @xmath67 into ray @xmath104 and all sufficiently large negative powers of @xmath163 send @xmath68 into ray @xmath104 , and this is not possible for an element of @xmath98 .",
    "this means that @xmath112 maps an infinite subset of ray @xmath28 onto almost all of ray @xmath104 ( observe that ray @xmath104 is almost contained in the support of @xmath163 so must be almost contained in the image of the unions of rays @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) . now applying similar arguments to @xmath152 we get",
    "that @xmath112 is a bijection between rays @xmath28 and @xmath104 except for finitely many points .",
    "in fact , @xmath112 must induce bijections between the congruence classes modulo @xmath127 ( except for finitely many points ) inside the two ray systems .",
    "thus @xmath112 induces a permutation of the ray system . again , looking at large positive powers we deduce that @xmath171 and since the support of @xmath163 is almost equal to the union of two rays , we must have that @xmath172 , as @xmath17 and hence @xmath163 have exactly @xmath127 orbits .",
    "in particular , we may deduce that @xmath112 normalises @xmath124 .",
    "so @xmath173 .",
    "in order to proceed , it will be useful to change the ray system .",
    "specifically , each ray can be split into @xmath127 rays , preserving the order .",
    "this realises @xmath124 as a ( normal ) subgroup of @xmath174 .",
    "we say two of these new rays are equivalent if they came from the same old ray .",
    "thus there are @xmath6 equivalence classes , each having @xmath127 elements .",
    "the group @xmath124 acts on this new ray system as the subgroup of @xmath174 consisting of all @xmath175 such that @xmath176 whenever the @xmath164 and @xmath177 rays are equivalent .",
    "note that because we have split the rays , these translation amounts can be arbitrary in @xmath124 ( as a subgroup of @xmath178 ) and not just multiples of @xmath127 .",
    "in particular , we have that @xmath179 and the previous arguments imply that @xmath112 induces a bijection on the new ray system and sends equivalent rays to equivalent rays ( since it is actually permuting the old ray system ) . since @xmath112 permutes the rays , but must preserve equivalence classes , we get a homomorphism from @xmath180 to the subgroup of @xmath181 which preserves the equivalence classes - this is easily seen to be @xmath182 and the above homomorphism is split .",
    "as in theorem  [ thm_aut ] we now conclude that the kernel of this homomorphism is @xmath174 and hence we get that @xmath146 is @xmath147 .",
    "we note that @xmath121 is not finitely generated , for if it were , it would lie in some maximal @xmath148 .",
    "in this section we will give sharp estimates for the word length of elements of houghton s groups .",
    "this makes no sense for @xmath183 which is not finitely generated .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the metric in @xmath184 was described by lehnert @xcite . in order to deal with @xmath0  for @xmath35",
    ", we introduce the following measure of complexity of an element .",
    "given @xmath90 , we define @xmath185 , for @xmath186 , to be the largest integer such that @xmath187 . note that if @xmath188 , then necessarily @xmath189 , as the first element in each ray is numbered @xmath101 .",
    "the _ complexity _ of @xmath90 is the natural number @xmath190 , defined by @xmath191 and the _ translation amount _ of @xmath17 is @xmath192    the above remark combined with ( [ eq_zero_sum ] ) immediately implies @xmath193 .",
    "it is easy to see that an element with complexity zero is trivial , and only the generators @xmath194 have complexity one .",
    "let @xmath35 and @xmath90 , with complexity @xmath195 .",
    "then the word length @xmath196 of @xmath17 with respect to any finite generating set satisfies @xmath197 where the constants @xmath198 and @xmath199 only depend on the choice of generating set .",
    "since the word length with respect to two different finite generating sets differs only by a multiplicative constant , we can and will choose @xmath200 as generating set to work with , and show that the statement holds with @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "the lower bound is established by examining how multiplication by a generator can change the complexity .",
    "suppose @xmath17 has complexity @xmath203 and consider @xmath204 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that    @xmath205    where the first two cases are mutually exclusive , as @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath206 , which establishes the lower bound .",
    "the upper bound is obtained as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath90 has complexity @xmath203 .",
    "first we show by induction on @xmath207 that there is a word @xmath208 of length at most @xmath209 such that the complexity of @xmath210 is @xmath211 with @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the case @xmath214 is trivial . if @xmath215 , then there are @xmath25 with @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    ". moreover , @xmath219 , because the first case of ( [ eq_p_k ] ) is excluded , as it implies that @xmath220 , contrary to our assumption .",
    "this completes the induction step .",
    "we are now in the situation that @xmath221 and loosely speaking we proceed as follows .    1",
    ".   we push all irregularities into ray @xmath222 , i.e. multiply by @xmath223 .",
    "2 .   we push all points back into the ray to which they belong , except for those from ray @xmath222 which we mix into ray @xmath101 , say .",
    "we push out of ray @xmath101 separating the points belonging to rays @xmath222 and @xmath101 into ray @xmath222 and any other ray , say ray @xmath224 , respectively .",
    "4 .   we push the points belonging to ray @xmath101 back from ray @xmath224 into it .",
    "these four steps can be achieved by multiplying by an element @xmath225 of length at most @xmath226 , such that @xmath227 is an element which , for each @xmath28 , permutes an initial segment @xmath228 of ray @xmath28 .",
    "notice that @xmath229 is now an element of @xmath98 which maps each ray to itself , and hence @xmath230 for all @xmath28 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath225 can be chosen so that the total length of the moved intervals , @xmath231 . finally , we sort each of these intervals using a recursive procedure , modeled on standard merge sort .    in order to sort",
    "the interval @xmath232 say , we push each of its points out of ray @xmath224 and into either ray @xmath222 if it belongs to the lower half , or to ray @xmath101 if it belongs to the upper half of @xmath233 .",
    "if each of the two halves occurs in the correct order , then we only have to push them back into ray @xmath224 and are done , having used @xmath234 generators .",
    "if the two halves are not yet sorted , then we use the same `` separate the upper and lower halves '' approach on each of them recursively in order to sort them .",
    "in total this takes at most @xmath235 steps .",
    "altogether we have used at most @xmath236 generators to represent the inverse of @xmath17 ; we used the hypothesis @xmath237 in the last inequality .",
    "we note that because there are many permutations , the fraction of elements which are close to the lower bound goes to zero in much the same way as shown for thompson s group @xmath1 by birget @xcite and its generalization @xmath238 by burillo and cleary @xcite .",
    "let @xmath239 .",
    "for @xmath98 take the generating set @xmath240 with @xmath241 elements .",
    "consider the following sets :    * @xmath242 is the ball of radius @xmath104 , * @xmath243 is the set of elements in @xmath98 which have complexity @xmath244 , * @xmath245 is the set of elements of @xmath243 which have word length at most @xmath246    then , we have that @xmath247    an element of complexity @xmath203 , according to the metric estimates proved above , has word length between @xmath203 and @xmath248 .",
    "what this lemma means is that most elements with complexity @xmath203 will have word length closer to @xmath248 than to @xmath203 .",
    "observe that @xmath249 because it is a subset .",
    "now , introduce the @xmath243 as @xmath250 and the proof will be complete if we show that @xmath251 in @xmath243 there are at least @xmath252 elements .",
    "this is because we can take a transposition involving a point at distance @xmath104 down one of the rays , with another point .",
    "since this already ensures @xmath244 , we are free to choose any permutation of the other @xmath253 points which are at one of the first @xmath104 positions in each ray . and inside @xmath254 , counting grossly according to the number of generators , there are at most @xmath255 elements .",
    "now the limit becomes @xmath256 which is easily seen that it approaches infinity using stirling s formula and the fact that @xmath239 .",
    "consequentially , these estimates give an easy way to see that the group has exponential growth .",
    "we note that exponential growth also follows easily from the fact that @xmath257 and @xmath258 generate a free subsemigroup .",
    "let @xmath259 .",
    "then @xmath98 has exponential growth .    consider a finitary permutation of complexity @xmath203 , and observe that there are at least @xmath260 of those . by the metric estimate ,",
    "its word length is at most @xmath261 .",
    "using again as in the previous lemma the notation @xmath242 for a ball , we will have that the group has exponential growth if @xmath262 in our case , this amounts to @xmath263",
    "we note that each @xmath98 is a subgroup of @xmath264 for @xmath265 and that our estimates together with work of lehnert are enough to give at least quadratic distortion for some of these embeddings .",
    "the group @xmath2 is at least quadratically distorted in @xmath264 for @xmath266 .",
    "we consider the element @xmath267 of @xmath184 which has @xmath268 and transposes @xmath269 and @xmath270 for all @xmath271 .",
    "then @xmath267 corresponds to the word @xmath272 defined in theorem 8 of @xcite , where it is shown to have length of the order of @xmath273 with respect to the generators of @xmath184 in lemma 10 there , which are exactly the generators for @xmath184 given in the introduction .",
    "one easily checks that @xmath274 in @xmath275 .",
    "thus a family of words of quadratically growing length in @xmath184 has linearly growing length in @xmath275 , which proves the theorem .    a natural , but seemingly difficult , question is whether @xmath98 is distorted in @xmath276 for @xmath277 .",
    "another question , which also seems difficult , is to ask whether @xmath98 is distorted in thompson s group @xmath1 , under the embeddings mentioned in the introduction , @xcite .",
    "commensurations give rise to quasi - isometries and are often a rich source of examples of quasi - isometries . here",
    "we show that the natural map from the commensurator of @xmath0  to the quasi - isometry group of @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath278 , is an injection .",
    "that is , we show that each commensuration is not within a bounded distance of the identity . that this is an injection also follows from the more general argument of whyte which appears as proposition 7.5 in farb - mosher @xcite .    the natural homomorphism from @xmath121 to @xmath278",
    "is an embedding for @xmath279 .",
    "we will show that for each non - trivial @xmath151 and every @xmath280 we can find a @xmath281 such that @xmath282 , so none of the non - trivial images are within a bounded distance of the identity . by theorem  [ thm_com ] , we can and",
    "will view @xmath112 as a non - trivial element of @xmath283 for some even @xmath127 .",
    "if @xmath112 eventually translates a ray @xmath28 non - trivially to a possibly different ray @xmath29 , then we let @xmath284 , a transposition in the translated ray .",
    "the image of @xmath17 under conjugation by @xmath112 is the transposition @xmath285 , and the distance @xmath286 is the length of @xmath287 , which is at least @xmath288 since it moves at least one point at distance @xmath288 down one of the rays .",
    "if @xmath112 does not eventually translate a ray but eventually non - trivially permutes ray @xmath28 with another ray @xmath29 , then we can show boundedness away from the identity by taking @xmath289 . the point @xmath290 is fixed by @xmath17 but is moved to @xmath291 under @xmath163 ensuring that the length of @xmath287 is at least @xmath288 .    finally , if @xmath112 does not have the preceding two properties , then @xmath112 is a non - trivial finitary permutation .",
    "since houghton s group is @xmath104-transitive , for every @xmath104 , we can find a @xmath281 such that @xmath292 has support disjoint from that of @xmath112 , and at distance at least @xmath288 down one of the rays .",

    "houghton s groups are long known to be hopfian although they are not residually finite , see @xcite . in this section",
    "we will prove that @xmath0  is not co - hopfian , by exhibiting a map which is injective but not surjective .",
    "the map is the following : @xmath294 defined by : if @xmath295 , then : @xmath296    it is straightforward to show that @xmath297 is a homomorphism .",
    "it is injective , because if @xmath298 is not the identity with @xmath299 , then @xmath300 . and clearly the map is not surjective , because the permutation always sends adjacent points @xmath301 , @xmath302 to adjacent points , and a permutation which does not do this can not be in the image .",
    "one can well - order the ray system by taking a lexicographic order .",
    "the group @xmath98 is then the group of all almost order preserving bijections of the well - ordered ray system .",
    "it is then clear that the ray system minus a point is order isomorphic to the original ray system , which demonstrates that a point stabiliser is a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath98 ."
