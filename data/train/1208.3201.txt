    "<S> the core is composed of degenerate matter , mostly neutrons and a small fraction of protons and electrons ( and possibly exotica , such as hyperons and deconfined quarks , which we do not consider here ) . immediately after neutron star formation , this matter is in a normal state due to the high temperatures reached in stellar core collapse . however , neutron stars cool rapidly through the emission of neutrinos , and when the temperature drops below the ( density - dependent ) critical temperature for cooper pairing , neutrons and protons form a superfluid and superconductor , respectively@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superfluid neutrons rotate by forming quantized vortices , and the spatial distribution of these vortices determines the rotation rate of the superfluid core ; for example , vortices migrate away from the stellar axis of rotation when the superfluid angular velocity @xmath4 decreases whereas @xmath4 can not change if the vortices are fixed in location , that is , when they are pinned . meanwhile , </S>",
    "<S> normal matter ( for example , in the crust ) rotates at an angular velocity @xmath5 that decreases as a result of energy loss from the stellar surface due to magnetic dipole radiation , that is , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the neutron star magnetic field and radius , respectively@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a rapid decline in surface temperature was recently detected in the 330-year - old neutron star in the cassiopeia  a supernova remnant@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed cooling can be understood as being caused by the recent onset of neutron superfluidity in the core of the star , combined with a much earlier onset of proton superconductivity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has provided the first direct constraints on core superfluid and superconducting properties from neutron star observations . </S>",
    "<S> these new results motivate studies of possible implications . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the rotational evolution of young pulsars using the newly constrained superfluid properties and assuming this superfluid core is allowed to decouple ( as discussed below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use simulations@xcite of the cooling of a neutron star to determine the fraction of the neutron star core that is superfluid as a function of time ; this allows us to track the normal and superfluid components of the moment of inertia as the star ages ( see supplementary fig .  [ fig : evol ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a simple phenomenological model for the rotational evolution of the normal and superfluid components of the star : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the moments of inertia of the normal and superfluid components , respectively , ( and @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are torques associated with vortex pinning@xcite and dissipative mutual friction@xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that it is the rotation of the normal component @xmath5 that is observed in pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> there are three simple limits that we can consider . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that friction acts on a much shorter timescale than the spin - down timescale@xcite ; this is the conventional view of rotational evolution , which leads to @xmath4 closely tracking @xmath5 and a braking index @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are first and second , respectively , time derivatives of the parameter @xmath20 ) , at odds with all measured values@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second limit is when there is no pinning or friction ; we find that this leads to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the final case , which we consider in detail here , is when pinning causes @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equations ( [ eq : omegadot0 ] ) and ( [ eq : omegadotsf ] ) can then be combined to give @xmath23 the spin lag , @xmath24 , is the difference in rotational velocity between the superfluid and normal components . some examples of decoupled spin evolution are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ppdot ] .    conventional pulsar spin evolution only accounts for the second term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : omegadot ] ) , with constant @xmath8 and @xmath11 . in this case , pulsars born at a particular spin period ( @xmath25 ) evolve by moving along lines of constant@xcite @xmath8 , and the characteristic age @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is an estimate of the true age of the pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> however , this again suggests that the conventional picture is incomplete : in cases where an independent age can be estimated ( for example , from studying the expansion of an associated supernova remnant ) , the result is often quite different from the characteristic age ; this can be seen in table  [ tab : psr ] . </S>",
    "<S> when superfluid decoupling is taken into account , spin evolution is similar to the conventional course , except now the moment of inertia decreases over time . </S>",
    "<S> if the spin lag remains small ( for example , as a result of an angular momentum sink acting on the superfluid ) , only a small deviation ( from evolution along a constant @xmath8 track ) is seen at intermediate and late times ( after @xmath28  yr ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that we are considering intermediate times ( @xmath29  yr ) in the life of a neutron star , in between the short timescale for glitch recurrence@xcite ( @xmath30  yr ) and the long timescales for magnetic field diffusion@xcite and cooling@xcite ( @xmath31  yr ) . on the other hand , if the spin lag is allowed to become large ( for example , owing to strong vortex pinning ) , then we see that a decreasing @xmath11 can mimic a strongly increasing magnetic field , leading to pulsars evolving in the way suggested@xcite for psr  j1734@xmath323333 with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> a further departure from the conventional picture is that the characteristic age is not an accurate indication of the true age of a pulsar at early times .    </S>",
    "<S> not only are the spin period @xmath34 and first time derivative of the period @xmath35 observable quantities , in some cases the second time derivative @xmath36 can be measured . </S>",
    "<S> this provides another test for our model . </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tab : psr ] gives data on eight systems where the braking index @xmath0 , which is proportional to @xmath36 , has been measured , whereas our model predicts the braking index to be [ see equation  ( [ eq : omegadot ] ) ] @xmath37 where the second equality is obtained when @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath26 and @xmath0 are observable quantities ( related simply to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) for a given pulsar , we can compare our predictions to the pulsars in table  [ tab : psr ] ; this is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : timescales ] . for the crab pulsar ( the only one with a known age ) , we infer a relatively high mass of @xmath39 ( for the particular equation of state and superfluid properties we consider ; see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can use the mass determination to estimate the initial period and magnetic field of the pulsar , and we find an initial period @xmath40  s and @xmath41  g.    the fact that our simple model is able to explain the observed pulsar properties demonstrates the merits of the notion of decoupled spin - evolution due to the onset of core superfluidity . </S>",
    "<S> however , key questions remain to be understood . </S>",
    "<S> the main assumption in our model is that core superfluid neutrons are allowed to decouple and pin . </S>",
    "<S> core pinning is thought to be the result of the interaction between superfluid vortices and fluxtubes in the proton superconductor@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether this mechanism can be strong enough to act in the way assumed in our analysis is not clear at this time . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical work is also required to determine whether the spin - lag @xmath24 can be kept small during the evolution by an ( at this time ) unspecified angular momentum sink . from an observational point - of - view </S>",
    "<S> , discovery and long - term monitoring of a large number of systems by radio telescopes such as lofar and ska will allow accurate timing of many young pulsars in the future . </S>",
    "<S> taking these pulsars as an ensemble , we can constrain the nuclear equation of state and superfluid properties ( because these determine the evolution of the moment of inertia ) , analogous to what is done in studies of neutron star thermal evolution . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of these properties can then be used to infer the mass of individual pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> finally , radio timing measurements may be able to constrain neutron star thermal evolution , independently of measurements at x - ray energies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added in proof . </S>",
    "<S> _ after completion of this work , we became aware of the independent development of a similar mechanism for variation of the pulsar - braking index that was presented by e.  kantor at two conferences in 2011 ( http://go.nature.com/sxawen ; http://go.nature.com/veaot1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> +    ) . </S>",
    "<S> the thin diagonal lines denote characteristic age ( @xmath42 ) and inferred magnetic field [ @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are spin evolution tracks for pulsars with mass @xmath44 ( red , dashed ) and @xmath45 ( blue , solid ) , where the spin lag is maintained at @xmath46 ( by an additional angular momentum sink ) ; the filled circles denote the evolution at ages 1000 , 2000 , and @xmath47  yr . also shown ( green , thin solid ) is the evolution of a pulsar where the spin lag is allowed to grow . from left to right , the initial spin period and magnetic field ( @xmath48 ) are taken to be ( 0.02  s , @xmath49  g ) , ( 0.1  s , @xmath50  g ) , and ( 1  s , @xmath51  g ) . </S>",
