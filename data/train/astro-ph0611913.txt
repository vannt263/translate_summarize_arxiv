    "galaxy clusters are ideal laboratories in which to study dark matter , being the most massive bound structures in the universe and dominated by their dark matter component ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "constraining the clustering properties of dark matter is crucial for refining structure formation models that predict both the shapes of dark matter halos and their mass function ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several methods are used to measure galaxy cluster dark matter profile shapes and halo masses on a range of scales , including x - ray studies , dynamical analyses , sunyaev - zeldovich surveys , and gravitational lensing .",
    "however , all of these methods require simplifying assumptions to be made regarding the shape and/or dynamical state of the cluster in order to derive meaningful constraints from available data .",
    "most parametric methods typically assume spherical symmetry of the halo and x - ray and dynamical estimates additionally assume virialization of the cluster . however ,",
    "examination of halos in cdm structure formation simulations ( e.g. @xcite ( using the millennium simulation ) ; @xcite ) and observed galaxy clusters show both of these assumptions to be unphysical ; simulations show significant triaxiality in cluster - scale halos and observed galaxy clusters often exhibit complex dynamics that suggest recent or ongoing mergers and disruption ( e.g. cl0024 + 1654 , @xcite ; 1e0657 - 558 , @xcite ) . understanding the impact of these physical realities on cluster mass and parameter estimates is crucial for accurate comparisons between measured cluster properties and model predictions .",
    "we focus on the impact of deviations from three assumptions frequently made in weak lensing analyses of galaxy clusters .",
    "gravitational lensing is an appealing tool for cluster studies because it is sensitive only to the projected mass and thus requires no assumptions be made about the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "however , because the signal - to - noise ratio is low for weak lensing measurements and there is significant degeneracy along the line - of - sight , only very simple parametric models can be fit . even using space - based weak lensing data ( where the number density of background sources useful for a weak lensing analysis is a factor of a few higher than that of ground - based data ) , it is often difficult to distinguish between a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) with mass density as a function of distance from halo centre @xmath3 given by @xmath4 and the universal dark matter profile of @xcite ( nfw ) with @xmath5 in the innermost regions and @xmath6 in the outer regions .",
    "most cluster profile fits are carried out in the hope of either supporting or refuting the universality of the nfw profile and thus testing the cdm paradigm .",
    "the nfw is typically parameterized by an approximate virial mass @xmath7 and a concentration parameter , @xmath8 , and simulations predict a strong correlation between the two . for a cluster of @xmath9 m@xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "however , several authors ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have recently reported results in the very low probability tail of the predicted distribution ; notably , in a combined weak and strong lensing analysis of abell 1689 , @xcite report a concentration parameter of @xmath12 , when @xmath13 is expected . while one such result is not damning , especially given the very complex , likely not relaxed , structure of a1689 described recently by @xcite , it is nonetheless of interest to investigate how possible future discrepancies between observations and the predictions of @xmath0cdm should be interpreted .",
    "crucially , more advanced n - body simulations carried out since the ground - breaking work of nfw indicate that cluster - scale dark matter halos are expected to be significantly triaxial , with axis ratios between minor and major axes as small as 0.4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite applied a fully triaxial nfw model to the shear map of abell 1689 to find that it is consistent with @xmath14 of cluster - scale halos , and @xcite showed that a triaxial nfw can reconcile parameter values derived from observations of the cluster ms2137 - 23 to predictions from n - body simulations . here",
    "we carry out a general study of the statistical effects of triaxiality on weak lensing analysis .",
    "in addition to the question of triaxiality , there is also significant scatter in the inner and outer slopes of nfw - like profiles in simulations .",
    "even the mean value of the inner slope is contentious , with some groups ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) finding it to be steeper than nfw .",
    "these effects have been explored in various combinations in the context of strong lensing , for example @xcite investigated the interplay of triaxiality and slope constraints in strong lensing analyses .",
    "we seek to measure the effects of these three alterations  triaxiality and variations in the inner and outer slopes  to the spherical nfw profile on weak lensing parameter and mass estimation . given the difficulty of distinguishing even entirely different classes of potential dark matter profiles using weak lensing data it is not currently feasible to meaningfully constrain complex nfw - like models with larger numbers of parameters that allow for such variations .",
    "there are several useful elliptical nfw models obtained by perturbing the lensing potential of a spherical nfw model ; however , these are only realistic for low ellipticities and do not account for full triaxial structure ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore estimate the effects of the three expected deviations from a spherical nfw on the model parameters and cluster masses derived fitting the simplest models ( sis , standard nfw and the isothermal ellipsoid sie ) to weak lensing data . here",
    "we are interested in the properties of individual clusters ; stacking the lensing signal from a sample of clusters gives a much higher signal - to - noise for the determination of their average profile ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also note that we consider here the impact of cluster morphology rather than structure along the line of sight ( for more on line of sight structure , see e.g. @xcite ) . in the next section",
    "we introduce the three altered nfw - like profiles and describe their lensing properties as implemented in the simulations described in section 3 .",
    "we present our results in section 4 , and discuss our findings in section 5 .",
    "weak lensing distorts the shapes and number densities of background galaxies .",
    "the shape and orientation of a background galaxy can be described by a complex ellipticity @xmath15 , with modulus @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the minor : major axis ratio , and a phase that is twice the position angle @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the galaxy s shape is distorted by the weak lensing reduced shear , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the lensing shear and @xmath22 the convergence , such that the ellipticity of the lensed galaxy @xmath23 becomes @xmath24 in the limit of weak deflections .",
    "the distributions of ellipticities for the lensed and unlensed populations are related by @xmath25 assuming a zero - mean unlensed population , the expectation values for the lensed ellipticity on a piece of sky is @xmath26 .",
    "this is the basis for weak lensing analysis in which the shapes of images are measured to estimate the shear profile generated by an astronomical lens .",
    "lensing also changes the number counts of galaxies on the sky via competing effects ; some faint sources in highly magnified regions are made brighter and pushed above the flux limit of the observation , but those same regions are stretched by the lensing across a larger patch of sky and so the number density of sources is reduced .",
    "thus the number of sources in the lensed sky @xmath27 is related to that in the unlensed background @xmath28 and the slope of the number counts of sources at a given flux limit @xmath29 by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the lensing magnification @xmath32 .",
    "a full description of these effects is given in @xcite .",
    "we now describe the characteristic behaviour of the convergence @xmath22 and shear @xmath21 of the three analytic nfw - like density profiles we study .",
    "a full parameterization for a triaxial nfw halo is given by @xcite ( hereon js02 ) .",
    "they generalize the spherical nfw profile to obtain a density profile @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the characteristic overdensity of the halo , @xmath35 the critical density of the universe at the redshift @xmath36 of the cluster , @xmath37 a scale radius , @xmath38 a triaxial radius @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 the minor : major and intermediate : major axis ratios , respectively . in a different choice from js02",
    "we define a triaxial virial radius @xmath42 such that the mean density contained within an ellipsoid of semi - major axis @xmath42 is @xmath43 such that the concentration is @xmath44 the characteristic overdensity is @xmath45 the same as for a spherical nfw profile , and the virial mass is @xmath46 this differs significantly from the parameterization of js02 in which the ellipsoidal virial radius is defined in terms of an overdensity dependent on the axis ratios .",
    "further , there the virial mass is defined in terms of an effective spherical virial radius that is a constant fraction of the ellipsoidal virial radius , making it independent of the axis ratios of the ellipsoid .    while the parameterization of jing @xmath47 suto has the appealing property of giving the virial mass as a function only of the virial radius with no need for reference to the axis ratios of the triaxial halo , it is not ideal for our purposes .",
    "our choice of parameters treats the ellipsoid as such all along without approximation and gives an effective concentration of @xmath48 along each of the three halo axes .",
    "further , our choice of an overdensity at collapse independent of axis ratio is well motivated by ellipsoidal collapse models that predict collapse to stop at the same enclosed density as does spherical collapse ( @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the advantages of deriving a mass from knowledge of the virial radius alone are mostly lost in the context of profile fitting to observational data , as the axis ratios of the cluster enter into the characteristic overdensity and thus are necessary parameters in any fit of the triaxial model .",
    "most crucial to any work is consistency when comparing parameters across different bodies of work ; to this end we include in appendix a conversions and comparisons between our parameterization and that of js02 , as well as to parameters derived by fitting to a spherically averaged density profile , similar to those often quoted for n - body simulations .",
    "though all our formalism is valid for a general triaxial halo , we focus primarily on symmetric prolate and oblate halos , the first with two equal - length short axes and the second with two equal - length long axes .",
    "for ease of distinguishing between these representative halos we introduce an axis ratio @xmath49 , defined as the ratio between the odd axis and the similar axes , so that a prolate halo with @xmath50 and @xmath51 has an axis ratio @xmath52 , while an oblate halo with @xmath53 and @xmath54 has an axis ratio @xmath55 . moving from small to large axis ratios @xmath49 is thus equivalent to beginning with a very flat , oblate halo ( a `` pancake '' ) , stretching it along the short axis until it becomes spherical ( @xmath56 ) , and continuing to stretch the same axis past spherical , finally ending with a very prolate , `` cigar''-like halo .",
    "the full derivation of the lensing properties of a triaxial halo is given by @xcite ( hereon ols ) , and we summarize some of that work here . , we keep @xmath57 as a variable in our notation for consistency with ols . ]",
    "the triaxial halo is projected onto the plane of the sky to find its projected elliptical isodensity contours as a function of the halo s axis ratios and orientation angles ( @xmath58 , @xmath18 ) with respect to the the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "the elliptical radius is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 are physical coordinates on the sky with respect to the centre of the halo , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 the axis ratio @xmath64 of the elliptical contours is then given by @xmath65 and their orientation angle @xmath66 on the sky by @xmath67    here we diverge slightly from ols s treatment as we are interested not in deflection angles but in the lensing shear and convergence , both combinations of second derivatives of the lensing potential @xmath68 ( commas indicate differentiation ) : @xmath69 these derivatives are calculated as functions of integrals of the spherical convergence @xmath70 ( see e.g. @xcite for a full treatment of weak lensing by a spherical nfw profile ) following the method of @xcite and @xcite , normalized by a factor of @xmath71 from equation  [ eq : f ] ( see ols for the derivation of this normalization ) @xmath72 where @xmath73^{n+1/2}}du,\\label{eq : k}\\\\ j_n(x , y ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f}}\\int_0 ^ 1 \\frac{\\kappa(\\zeta(u)^2)}{[1 - ( 1-q^2)u]^{n+1/2}}du,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath74    note that our radial variable @xmath75 appears different from keeton s @xmath76 because it is defined in terms of two axis ratios @xmath77 and @xmath78 rather than one @xmath64 : @xmath79 .",
    "this reflects a dependence on the 3d structure of the cluster ; for example , extended structure along the line of sight decreases @xmath77 and thus increases the convergence and shear at a given @xmath60 .",

    "the thick solid lines show the limits of the aperture from which weak lensing data is taken , and the dashed line shows the @xmath37 ellipse for each projection ( note that @xmath37 is scaled by the axis ratio in each direction , so that when looking at the minor axis of a triaxial halo , the apparent scale radius is @xmath84 times the @xmath37 value of the halo ) .",

    "the prolate halo oriented with odd axis along the line of sight has the highest convergence due to the large quantity of projected mass hidden in it , while the oblate halo in the same configuration has very low values of @xmath22 .",
    "when viewed with the odd axis in the plane of the sky the situation is reversed ; the prolate halo has low convergence due to a smaller amount of mass along the line of sight while the oblate halo has higher convergence values .",
    "viewing halos in projection is sometimes counterintuitive ; for halos of equal triaxial virial mass the 3-d major axis of a prolate halo is longer than that of an oblate halo , which is in turn longer than the 3-d radius of a spherical halo .",
    "this is not apparent in projection , where , when the odd axis is in the plane of sky , the larger total amount of mass in the halo along the line of sight makes the isodensity contours of the oblate halo larger than those of its prolate counterpart .",
    "we consider profiles in which only one of the inner or outer slopes is allowed to vary from its canonical nfw value .",

    "this trend is visible in figure  [ fig : orientplots ] , where the mass and concentration parameter distribution obtained for a spherical halo is overplotted on that obtained from an @xmath81 , @xmath164 prolate halo of the same mass .",
    "the distributions for the prolate halo are significantly more non - gaussian than their spherical counterparts ; even more , the distribution of @xmath8 values appears somewhat bimodal , with most halos falling in a gaussian - like distribution around the true value @xmath80 but a significant number in a subpopulation centered at @xmath174 . plotting the axis ratios on the sky @xmath64 ( as calculated in equation  [ eq : q ] ) of the member halos of these two apparent `` populations , '' as is done in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : orientplots ] , shows that the sub - group on the right contains most of the @xmath175 , near los orientated lenses .",
    "it seems then that halos with significant triaxiality visible in the plane of the sky are effectively radially averaged by fitting with a spherical model , and thus the parameters fit are evenly distributed near the true value , with a slight skew to low values .",
    "however , halos that appear almost spherical on the sky are consistently fit as more massive , more concentrated halos in this case of an underlying prolate lens .",

    "we focus our further discussions on the impacts of triaxiality , the most potentially insidious of the three deviations from nfw we study , as it can not be fully investigated and marginalized by any lensing technique due to degeneracies along the line of sight .    to begin",
    ", it is crucial to know how much triaxiality is expected in the cluster - sized halos .",
    "recent n - body studies by @xcite have resulted in detailed predictions of the axis ratio distribution for dark matter halos , finding that halos tend to be more prolate than oblate , with the distribution for @xmath41 peaking near @xmath187 and that for @xmath40 peaking near @xmath188 with a tail down to @xmath189 .",
    "while the inclusion of baryon interactions might reduce the levels of predicted triaxiality ( h. hoekstra , private communication ) , shaw s predictions are a very useful limiting case in which to apply our results .",

    "the means are equal to the true values , and the distributions are close to gaussian , but with very long tails toward high values . though those tails are indeed extended by triaxiality , indicated by small increases in the dispersion of the distributions from those for distributions obtained by lensing through spherical halos , the total effect of triaxiality on a complete population of clusters is very small .",

    "however , this conclusion neglects to take into account the effects of orientation on lensing efficiency .",
    "certain orientations of clusters will produce higher lensing efficiencies than others , making them more likely to be included in lensing - selected cluster surveys .",
    "figure  [ fig : lenseffic ] plots the average reduced shear over the annulus from which the weak lensing data is taken as a measure of lensing efficiency .     within the annulus located between 1 - 7.5 of the halo center ,",
    "the annulus from which the weak lensing data is drawn in the simulations , plotted as a function of axis ratio @xmath49 for los and plane halos.,width=302,height=302 ]    halos with significant mass along the line of sight are the best lenses ; prolate halos with high @xmath49 ( low @xmath84 and @xmath193 ) oriented along the line of sight have almost twice the average shear than does a spherical halo of the same mass .",
    "oblate halos with very low @xmath49 ( low @xmath84 and @xmath193 ) oriented in the plane of sky are also effective lenses , which can be understood by recalling that the long axis visible on the sky is also the length of the axis hidden in projection , giving rise to significant convergence and shear .",
    "halos that are the most efficient lenses will be more likely to be studied as lenses ; thus clusters selected for their lensing properties are likely to reside in the high - triaxiality , low probability tails of the halo distribution .",
    "while triaxial halos averaged over orientation in simulations give mean parameter values equal to the true values , this type of simulation does not recreate observational conditions in which prolate halos are much more likely to be observed as lenses when oriented near the line of sight , and oblate halos when oriented in the plane of the sky .",
    "furthermore , since very prolate and oblate halos ( aligned advantageously ) are much better lenses than spherical halos , observed halos , especially those with strong lensing effects such as abell 1689 , are likely to be represent the high triaxiality end of the halo distribution .    understanding this behavior is important for survey design ( see e.g. @xcite for more on shear - selected surveys ) ; any criteria involving lensing efficiency will skew both mass and concentration estimates high ! as an example , the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : monte ] shows distributions of nfw parameters for the same population of 10,000 lensing realizations shown above , this time keeping only parameters from realizations in which the lensing halos have more than a cutoff level of lensing efficiency , set to be the lensing efficiency of a spherical halo of @xmath190 m@xmath10 , @xmath194 .",
    "though even after this cut the effects of triaxiality are very small , the mean parameter values do indeed shift slightly towards higher mass and concentration .      a potential impact of the deviations from nfw that we study here that we have not yet addressed is that of changing the frequency with which one model family is incorrectly preferenced over another .",
    "we find that varying the outer slope has no significant impact , and that triaxiality has only a very small impact , with very triaxial halos of @xmath163 being misidentified as sis halos in 4% more realizations than are spherical halos .",
    "however , changes in the inner slope prove to be very significant ; for an inner slope of @xmath195 nfws are misidentified as sis halos in 83% more realizations than are canonical nfw halos .",
    "interestingly , an nfw with @xmath183 fares significantly _ better _ , with misidentification in only 29% more realizations .",
    "it is not surprising that as the inner slope of the nfw model approaches the isothermal slope it would be confused more often with an sis , and that fact that it fares worst when @xmath195 suggests that the sis fitting routine is `` averaging '' the slope in some sense over the range in which the data is taken .",
    "it is thus clear that weak lensing analyses are quite sensitive to the inner slope , even though the data are taken from outside the inner regions of the cluster , due to the non - local nature of the gravitational potential .",
    "our choice to use the traditional @xmath196 , as did @xcite , rather than @xmath197 of @xcite in our treatment of an nfw with a free inner slope derives from two factors .",
    "the first is that @xmath8 is the more commonly used parameter and thus more useful for comparisons ; the second is that while @xcite argue that the point at which the logarithmic slope is @xmath102 is a more physical quantity than the scale radius @xmath149 , we feel that the break radius at which the slope of the nfw is the average of the asymptotic inner and outer slopes is an equally valid physical scale to use . in any case , the numerical values of concentration are most important in comparison to those from simulations and between different members of the cluster population , using the same definition .      in this paper",
    "we concentrate on constraints from weak lensing ; much work remains to be done , marginalising over the effects of triaxiality for cluster data sets , pioneered by @xcite for abell 1689 . in the past couple of years , a great deal of progress has been made in techniques combining weak and strong gravitational lensing constraints on cluster profiles ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , gravitational flexion has very recently been harnassed by @xcite to probe substructure in clusters , and is also a promising means of constraining the mass distribution in the regime where standard weak lensing approximations break down . besides the various regimes of gravitational lensing , large spectroscopic surveys have the potential to provide information essential to constructing models of the 3-d distribution of cluster mass and its dynamical history .",
    "so far this has only been undertaken for a very small number of clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the advent of wide - field spectroscopy makes this feasible . such spectroscopic studies combined with deep space - based observations ( where the number density of galaxies useful for shear measurements is several times that of ground - based data ) and sz and x - ray studies will allow for more detailed modeling of the mass distributions of clusters .",
    "we investigate the effects of triaxiality and variations in the slopes of the nfw profile on weak lensing parameter and mass estimates and find that for individual clusters the effects can be significant .",
    "triaxiality causes the mass and concentration to be over or under estimated by @xmath198 and a factor of 2 , respectively ; steepening the inner slope leads to up to @xmath199 underestimation of the mass and overestimation of the concentration by a factor of up to 3 ; scatter in the outer slope causes up to @xmath199 and @xmath200 errors in mass and concentration estimates , respectively .",
    "averaged over orientation and over predicted axis ratio distributions the errors induced by triaxiality are significantly reduced , which bodes well for the use of cluster masses as a cosmological probe ; however , when lensing efficiency is taken into account they become more important .",
    "thus the selection effects must be accounted for in survey design , for example when shear selected samples are employed or in future follow - up of clusters detected using the s - z effect .",
    "crucially , the effects of triaxiality along the line of sight and variations in halo slopes may lessen tensions between the unusual galaxy cluster concentration / mass estimates reported in recent work and the predictions of @xmath0cdm .",
