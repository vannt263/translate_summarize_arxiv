    "modeling the flow through wind turbines and wind farms is a research area of growing importance with the fast and worldwide development of installed wind farms .",

    "most popular atmospheric boundary layer computations are based on reynolds averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) turbulence models and large eddy simulation ( les ) approaches .",
    "pdf methods , based on stochastic lagrangian models , constitutes an interesting alternative ( see the discussions in pope @xcite ) that have been not yet fully developed in the case of atmospheric boundary layer modeling but are mostly used for reactive flows because this approach does not necessitate to approximate the reaction terms ( haworth @xcite , minier and peirano @xcite ) . among the reasons that can explain this phenomena , we can first rise the fact that such kinds of models handle nonlinear stochastic differential equations that necessitate a background on stochastic calculus , rather than classical pde analysis .",
    "second , the development of numerical solvers , based on stochastic particles approximation , requires the design of a hybrid lagrangian / eulerian algorithm from scratch .",

    ", we have developed a branch of sdm that includes atmospheric boundary layer modeling and ground interaction ( log law ) .    in this paper , we present our methodology to introduce wake models ( typically actuator disc models ) in the sdm solver",

    "we emphasize the fact that the basis of stochastic lagrangian models consists in describing the stochastic dynamics of a fluid particle s state variables @xmath0 , under an appropriated probabilistic space @xmath1 equipped with the expectation operator @xmath2 .",
    "the lagrangian approach allows to define the eulerian average of the velocity , classically represented by the bracket operator @xmath3 in the rans approach or @xmath4 in the les approach , as the mathematical conditional expectation of the particle velocity @xmath5 knowing its position @xmath6 @xmath7,\\ ] ] and more generally , for any function @xmath8 , @xmath9.\\ ] ] equivalently , in term of pdf modeling approach ( see @xcite for further details ) the eulerian density at time @xmath10 and at a given @xmath11 is identified with the conditioned lagrangian density , knowing the event @xmath12 .    the connections between rans / les models and stochastic lagrangian models are realized via a specific design of the stochastic equation coefficients for @xmath0 allowing to reproduce @xmath13 and reynolds - stress models ( see the review on lagrangian modeling in pope @xcite and the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular such pdf models can be used to reconstitute subgrid information of fluctuations in les modeling .",

    "it is noteworthy that the variance near the turbine is much higher for the rotating actuator disc simulation , although far from the turbine the differences begin to fade .",
    "it is also interesting that in rotating amd case the highest amount of variance is generated atop the turbine , while for the non - rotating amd the variance at the hub is uniformly strong along the turbine disc , and not just at the tip top .",
    "we can obverse the impact of this variance anomaly that propagates in the particles environment behind the mill to the left and top . knowing this , a remedy may consist to impose the values of the second order moments at the left boundary side from the warmup simulation to overcome this weird propagation of the variance .",
    "the same behavior can be seen in the vertical variance profiles , which are plotted at the same downstream positions as was done for @xmath264 ( see figure  [ figurevarianceprofiles ] ) . at one diameter from the turbine",
    ", we can observe the overestimation of @xmath296 for the nr - adm ( in red ) , in particular in the nacelle area . a best estimate of @xmath301",
    "could therefore contribute to reduce this variance anomaly .",

    "this information may be used for various purposes .",
    "contrary to deterministic methods , the stochastic methodology used here estimates the pdfs of the velocity field in just one simulation , directly by sampling the particle properties in the same way the various statistics presented before are estimated . plus",
    ", no time or spatial averaging is required , and it is possible to see how the pdf varies along the wake of a turbine .    in this section ,",
    "we present histograms that estimate the pdf of the streamwise velocity component @xmath302 , corresponding to several points before and after the wind turbine , located at the middle of the @xmath261 axis and at hub height . to obtain each histogram",

    "in recent years , wind energy has seen an important growth worldwide , and the construction and operation of large wind farms necessitates a better understanding of the flow inside and through them in realistic and dynamic atmospheric conditions . in the present study ,",
    "actuator disc methods have been coupled with the sdm solver @xcite , which uses a _ probability distribution function _ ( pdf ) approach to turbulent flow simulation based on stochastic lagrangian models .",
    "the result is an innovative methodology to simulate wind turbines and wind farms operating in atmospheric boundary layer flow .",
    "it has been shown that the particle setting of sdm is fit for mill simulations , providing qualitatively consistent estimations of the mill forces and wake properties .",
    "plus , the pdf framework coupled with actuator disc methods allows one to obtain an estimation of the wind variability in the wake of a wind turbine , something which - to the best knowledge of the authors - has never been accomplished before .",
    "the present work is part of a larger project , which seeks to simulate large wind farms with complex topography using the sdm solver .",
    "moreover as a downscaling method , sdm aims to be coupled with dynamic boundary conditions coming typically from mesoscale meteorological solvers . here",
    ", the intent has been to present the methodology , as well as to give a preliminary validation analysis with respect to measurements and a comparison of the different models available , using simple attaptation of actuator disc models and just one turbine .",
    "future stages of the project will produce : ( 1 ) a wind farm simulation using dynamical downscaled boundary conditions coming from a coarse meteorological solver ; ( 2 ) simulations with complex topography ; and ( 3 ) implementation of more complex models for the blade forces in the sdm framework .    regarding this last point , we would like to conclude showing some of our ongoing work concerning individual blade visualizations , using the methodology presented in section [ subsec : adr ] . in particular , it is possible - by modifying the shape of the blade sectors - to obtain estimations of more involved 3d quantities than the ones presented here , such as the vorticity structures generated behind an individual mill . as proof of concept , figure [ fig : vorticity ] shows a visualization of such structures for the same turbine presented in section [ sec : simulations ] , but using a finer discretization and a smaller domain .",
    "future stages of our project will perfect these preliminary simulations , by introducing more complex models than the lagrangian actuator disc models presented in this work .",
    "the authors thank philippe drobinski for very fruitful discussions related to modeling aspects of the atmospheric boundary layer .",
    "a part of the drift of the fluid - particle velocity equation is a linear term of the form @xmath306 it means that during a time step @xmath193 , each component of the velocity behaves like a one - dimensional ornstein - uhlenbeck process of generic form : @xmath307 where here we assume that @xmath308 , @xmath42 , @xmath309 and @xmath310 are constants , or coefficients values frozen at the time @xmath10 . typically , from the tensor terms @xmath311 , we put in @xmath217 only the diagonal terms , while extra diagonal term are included in @xmath310 .",

    "this exponential scheme allows @xmath324 to take huge values , and does not explode in such case ( see minier , peirano and chibbaro @xcite ) .",
