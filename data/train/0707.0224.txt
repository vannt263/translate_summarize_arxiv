    "suppose @xmath32 is a stem which is adjacent to @xmath38 in @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is a leaf adjacent to @xmath32 in @xmath100 . it is obvious that @xmath101 can only be adjacent to @xmath31 or @xmath37 besides @xmath32 in @xmath0 .      _ subcase 2.1 .",

    "_ @xmath101 is adjacent to both @xmath31 and @xmath37 in @xmath0 .",
    "one may obtain a contradiction by a similar argument as in subcase 2.1 .",
    "+ hence @xmath31 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath101 and @xmath32 form at most two quadrangles with common edge @xmath107 by claim @xmath29 , and an induced subgraph of @xmath0 with the vertices @xmath31 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath101 and @xmath32 is isomorphic to the graph shown in figure @xmath108 ( dashed line indicates a possible edge ) .",
    "so the subgraph @xmath19 induced by all the vertices in the component , in @xmath100 , which contains the @xmath49-cycle @xmath30 is isomorphic to the graph shown in figure @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 . by the similar argument above , both subgraphs induced by the vertices in the component of @xmath106 and @xmath111 , respectively , which contain the @xmath49-cycle @xmath30 are also isomorphic to the graph shown in figure @xmath109",
    "so @xmath0 is isomorphic to the graph shown in figure @xmath112 .",
    "if we delete some edges from @xmath0 such that all vertices in @xmath113 are of degree two , then the spanning subgraph @xmath114 of @xmath0 will be the graph shown in figure @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath117 denote the vertices that are contained in a quadrangle which use the edge @xmath54 and @xmath118 .",
    "then a component containing the triangle @xmath119 of @xmath120 is either the triangle @xmath119 itself or a triangle satisfying the conditions in case @xmath46 .",
    "so @xmath54 is contained in at most one quadrangle in @xmath0 .",
    "the same argument can be applied to edges @xmath62 and @xmath55 .",
    "now we know that @xmath114 could be the graphs shown in figure @xmath25 .",
    "however , the graph shown in figure @xmath121 can be decomposed into three or four stars . hence , by lemma 1 , @xmath122 .",
    "so the only possible graph @xmath114 are the graphs shown in figure @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we add the edges back following the principle of claim @xmath29 , then @xmath0 can only be the graphs shown in figure @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 since every vertex in the triangle @xmath116 has degree at least three in @xmath0 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 2.@xmath43 + the main theorem has classified all graphs in @xmath1 with girth three . combining with theorem 1 , the only two families remaining to be determined are graphs of girth four or graphs with leaves and small girths .",
    "it seems that the structures of both families are much more complicated and new techniques are required in order to determine them completely ."
