    "topological defects : solitons , vortices , anyons , etc . , are discussed currently , see @xcite , in connection to new trends in physics of quantum devices , see @xcite .",
    "closest to applications and particularly addressed at this conference @xcite are the @xmath1 junctions which , linking two superconductors , provide degeneracy of their states with phase differences equal to @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the final goal of this publication is to show that in quasi one - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) superconductors the @xmath1 junctions are produced already at the single electronic level extendible to a finite spin polarization .",
    "the effect results from reconciliation of the spin and the charge which have been separated at the single chain level .",
    "the charge and the spin of the single electron reconfine as soon as @xmath4 or @xmath5 long range correlations are established due to interchain coupling . the phenomenon is much more general taking place , in other respects , also in such a common system as the charge density wave -cdw and in such a popular system as the doped antiferromagnet or the spin density wave as its quasi @xmath0 version @xcite .",
    "actually in this article we shall consider firstly and in greater details the cdw which is an object a bit distant to the mesoscopic community .",
    "the applications to superconductors will become apparent afterwards .",
    "we shall concentrate on effects of interchain coupling @xmath6 : confinement , topological constraints , combined symmetry , spin - charge recombination .",
    "a short review and basic references on history of solitons and related topics in correlated electronic systems ( like holes moving within the antiferromagnetic media ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "solitons in superconducting wires were considered very early @xcite , within the macroscopic regime of the ginzburg - landau theory , for the phase slips problem .",
    "closer to our goals is the microscopic solution for solitonic lattice in quasi @xmath0 superconductors @xcite at the zeeman magnetic field .",
    "this successful application of results from theory of cdws , see @xcite , to superconductors provides also a link of pair breaking effects in these different systems .",
    "the solitonic structures in qasi @xmath0 superconductors appear as a @xmath0 version of the well known fflo ( fulde , ferrel , larkin , ovchinnikov , see @xcite ) inhomogeneous state near the pair breaking limit .",
    "being very weak in @xmath5 , this effect becomes quite pronounced in systems with nested fermi surfaces which is the case of the @xmath0 limit .    to extend physics of solitons to the higher @xmath7 world ,",
    "the most important problem one faces is the effect of _ confinement _ ( s.b .",
    "1980 ) : as topological objects connecting degenerate vacuums , the solitons at @xmath6 acquire an infinite energy unless they reduce or compensate their topological charges .",
    "the problem is generic to solitons but it becomes particularly interesting at the electronic level where the spin - charge reconfinement appears as the result of topological constraints .",
    "the topological effects of @xmath6 ordering reconfines the charge and the spin _ locally _ while still with essentially different distributions .",
    "nevertheless _ integrally _ one of the two is screened again , being transferred to the collective mode , so that in transport the massive particles carry only either charge or spin as in @xmath0 , see reviews @xcite .",
    "the cdws were always considered as the most natural electronic systems to observe solitons .",
    "we shall devote to them some more attention because the cdws also became the subject of studies in mesoscopics @xcite .",
    "being a case of spontaneous symmetry breaking , the cdw order parameter @xmath8 $ ] possesses a manifold of degenerate ground states . for the @xmath9 fold commensurate cdw the energy @xmath10 $ ] reduces the allowed positions to multiples of @xmath11 , @xmath12",
    ". connecting trajectories @xmath13 are phase solitons , or ",
    "@xmath14 particles  after bishop _",
    "et al_. particularly important is the case @xmath15 for which solitons are clearly observed e.g. in polyacethylene @xcite or in organic mott insulators @xcite .    above the @xmath5 or @xmath4 transition temperature @xmath16 ,",
    "the symmetry is not broken and solitons are allowed to exist as elementary particles .",
    "but in the symmetry broken phase at @xmath17 , any local deformation must return the configuration to the same ( modulo @xmath18 for the phase ) state . otherwise the interchain interaction energy ( with the linear density @xmath19\\right\\rangle",
    "$ ] is lost when the effective phase @xmath20 at the soliton bearing chain @xmath21 acquires a finite ( and @xmath22 increment with respect to the neighboring chain values @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath0 allowed solitons do not satisfy this condition which originates a constant _ confinement force _ @xmath24 between them , hence the infinitely growing confinement energy @xmath25 .",
    "e.g. for @xmath15 the kinks should be bound in pairs or aggregate into macroscopic complexes with a particular role plaid by coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "especially interesting is the more complicated case of _ coexisting discrete and continuous symmetries_. as a result of their interference the topolological charge of solitons originated by the discrete symmetry can be compensated by gapless degrees of freedom originated by the continuous one .",
    "this scenario we shall discuss through the rest of the article .",
    "difference of ground states with even and odd numbers of particles is a common issue in mesoscopics . in cdws",
    "it also shows up in a spectacular way ( s.b .",
    "1980 , see @xcite .",
    "thus any pair of electrons or holes is accommodated to the extended ground states for which the overall phase difference becomes @xmath26 .",
    "phase increments are produced by phase slips which provide the spectral flow @xcite from the upper @xmath27 to the lower @xmath28 rims of the single particle gap .",
    "the phase slip requires for the amplitude @xmath29 to pass through zero , at which moment the complex order parameter has a shape of the amplitude soliton ( as , the kink @xmath30 ) . curiously , this instantaneous configuration becomes the stationary ground state for the case when only one electron is added to the system or when the total spin polarization is controlled to be nonzero , see figure 1 .",
    "the as carries the singly occupied mid - gap state , thus having a spin @xmath31 but its charge is compensated to zero by local dilatation of singlet vacuum states @xcite .    as a nontrivial topological object ( @xmath32 does not map onto itself ) the pure as is prohibited in @xmath6 environment .",
    "nevertheless it becomes allowed even their if it acquires phase tails with the total increment @xmath33 , see figure 2 .",
    "the length of these tails @xmath34 is determined by the weak interchain coupling , thus @xmath35 . as in @xmath0 , the sign of @xmath36 changes within the scale @xmath37 but further on , at the scale @xmath34 ,",
    "the factor @xmath38 $ ] also changes the sign thus leaving the product in @xmath32 to be invariant . as a result",
    "the 3d allowed particle is formed with the as core @xmath37 carrying the spin and the two phase @xmath39 twisting wings stretched over @xmath34 , each carrying the charge @xmath40 .",
    ".7     .35      we shall omit from consideration the case of repulsion which is relevant to the case of the incommensurate spin density wave or to a hole within the antiferromagnetic media which is important for doped mott insulators .",
    "these cases were emphasized in previous publications @xcite .",
    "here we shall concentrate upon systems with attraction which originate the gap and the discrete degeneracy in the spin channel .",
    "firstly we shall generalize the description of the cdw solitons to the quantum model .",
    "secondly we shall use the accumulated experience to arrive at our final goal : the spin carrier in the sc media .",
    "@xmath0 electronic systems are efficiently treated within the boson representation , see @xcite for a review .",
    "the variables can be chosen as @xmath41 which is the analog of the cdw phase and @xmath42 which is the angle of the @xmath43 spin rotation .",
    "these phases are normalized in such a way that their increments divided by @xmath44 count the electronic charge and spin .    for the incommensurate electronic systems the lagrangian can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the backward exchange scattering and @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the velocity .",
    "elementary excitations in @xmath0 are the _ spinon _ as a soliton @xmath49 , hence carrying the spin @xmath50 , and the gapless charge sound in @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to recall the alternative description in terms of conjugated phases .",
    "we shall need only the one for the charge channel which is the standard gauge phase @xmath52 of the superconductivity .",
    "phases @xmath41 and @xmath52 are related ( efetov and larkin 79 ) since their derivatives determine the same quantity - the current @xmath53 : @xmath54 .",
    "the term @xmath55 is duel to @xmath56 with @xmath57      the cdw order parameter is @xmath58\\cos",
    "\\theta   $ ] . the spin operator @xmath59 stands for what was the amplitude in the quasi- classical description and at presence of the spinon it changes the sign as it was for @xmath36 .",
    "hence for the cdw ordered state in a quasi @xmath0 system the allowed configuration must be composed with two components : the spin soliton @xmath60 and the phase wings @xmath61 where the charge @xmath62 is concentrated . beyond the low dimensionality ,",
    "a general view is : _ the spinon as a soliton bound to the semi - integer dislocation loop_.    ) of the phase circulation .",
    "for the cdw case the curls are displacements contours for the half integer dislocation pair . for the superconductivity",
    "the curls are lines of electric currents circulating through the normal core carrying the unpaired spin .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=207 ] .85      for the singlet superconductivity the order parameter is @xmath63\\cos \\theta $ ] . in @xmath6",
    "the elementary spin excitation is composed with the _ spin soliton _ @xmath64 supplied with _ current wings _ @xmath65 .",
    "the quasi @xmath0 interpretation is that the _ spinon works as a josephson _ @xmath1 _ _  junction _ _ in the superconducting wire .",
    "the @xmath66 view is a pair of superconducting @xmath1 _ vortices sharing the common core where the unpaired spin is localized_. the @xmath5 view is a _ half flux vortex loop which collapse is prevented by the spin confined in its center_.    the solitonic nature of the spinon in the quasi @xmath0 picture corresponds to the string of reversed sign of the order parameter left behind in the course of the spinon motion .",
    "the spin soliton becomes an elementary fragment of the stripe pattern near the pair breaking limit ( fflo phase ) . in a wire",
    "the @xmath44 wings of the spinon motion become the persistent current @xcite .    for this combined particle",
    "the electronic quantum numbers are reconfined ( while with different scales of localization ) .",
    "but integrally over the cross - section the local electric current induced by the spinon is compensated exactly by the back - flows at distant chains .",
    "this is a general property of the vortex dipole configuration constructed above .",
    "finally , the soliton as a state of the coherent media will not carry a current and itself will not be driven by a homogeneous electric field .",
    "our conclusions have been derived for weakly interacting sc or cdw chains .",
    "since the results are symmetrically and topologically characterized , they can be extrapolated to isotropic systems with strong coupling where a clear microscopical derivation is not available . here",
    "the hypothesis is that instead of normal carries excited or injected above the gap , the lowest states are the symmetry broken ones described above as semiroton - spinon complex .",
    "this construction can be processed from another side considering a vortex configuration bound to an unpaired electron . without assistance of the quasi one - dimensionality",
    ", a short coherence length is required to leave only a small number of intragap levels in the vortex core .    the existence of complex spin excitations in superconductors is ultimately related to robustness of the fflo phase at finite spin polarization .",
    "it must withstand a fragmentation due to quantum or thermal melting at small spin polarization .",
    "then any termination point of one stripe within the regular pattern ( the dislocation ) will be accompanied by the phase semiroton in accordance with the quasi @xmath0 picture ."
