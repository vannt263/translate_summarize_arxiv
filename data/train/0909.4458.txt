    "the most compelling evidence for the existence of intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) comes from the observation of ulxs , extragalactic x - ray sources with bolometric luminosities exceeding 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath1 which are located outside the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "these x - ray luminosities  if they are assumed to be isotropically radiated  are up to several orders of magnitude above the eddington limit for the maximum mass of stellar mass black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is still an open debate about whether any ulxs host imbhs .",
    "how imbhs form and evolve is also a subject of intense debate , but they are thought to be associated with events such as the implosion of massive stars formed during the very first stages of star formation , the collapse of dense star clusters , and the early growth of supermassive black holes lying in the center of galaxies @xcite .",
    "2xmm j011028.1460421 , referred to hereafter as hlx-1 , was discovered serendipitously by xmm - newton on 23 november 2004 ( hereafter xmm1 ) in the outskirts of the edge - on spiral galaxy eso 24349 , at a redshift of 0.0224 @xcite .",
    "its 0.2  10 kev unabsorbed x - ray luminosity , assuming isotropic emission , was found to be @xmath5 ergs s@xmath1 : one order of magnitude larger than the previously known brightest ulx ( miniutti et al .",
    "a second xmm - newton observation performed 4 years later ( on 28 november 2008  hereafter xmm2 ) revealed that the source spectrum and x - ray luminosity had changed . from its highest x - ray luminosity and the conservative assumption that the observed value exceeded the eddington limit by a factor of 10 , a lower limit of 500 m@xmath6  was derived for the black hole ( bh ) in hlx-1 , thus providing the strongest evidence so far that imbhs do exist @xcite .",
    "the evidence for spectral variability in hlx-1 from the two xmm - newton observations was the motivation for monitoring the source with the _ swift _",
    "x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "the aim of this program is to study its spectral properties as a function of its x - ray luminosity to search for any of the three canonical x - ray states identified in galactic black hole binaries ( gbhbs ) ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . observing transitions between these states could thus provide important information on the physical nature of ulxs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "despite its lower effective area compared to xmm - newton and chandra , the xrt can record enough counts in relatively short exposure times ( few to tens of kiloseconds ) to track any significant luminosity and spectral changes .",
    "this has been recently demonstrated by kaaret & feng ( 2009 ) who reported on a monitoring campaign with the xrt of three prototype ulxs , i.e. holmberg ix x-1 , ngc 5408 x-1 and ngc 4395 x-2 .",
    "no spectral state changes were observed in any of these three sources , despite significant changes in their x - ray luminosities ( by up to a factor of 9 ) .    in this paper , we present the results of the first two observations of our on - going monitoring campaign of hlx-1 with the _ swift _ xrt . compared with a previous xrt pointing performed one year before",
    ", this observation revealed not only a dramatic drop in the xrt count rate ( by a factor of @xmath2 ) but also a significant hardening of the x - ray spectrum as well as a dramatic re - brightening ( by a factor @xmath3 ) occurring simultaneously with a clear softening of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "hlx-1 was observed with _ swift _ under the target - of - opportunity ( too ) program on 3 occasions so far : s1 @xmath7 2008 - 10 - 24 ( 33.5 ks ) , s2 @xmath7 2009 - 08 - 05 ( 19.2 ks ) and s3 @xmath7 2009 - 08 - 16 ( 19.1 ks )",
    ". all the _",
    "swift_-xrt photon counting data were processed using the tool xrtpipeline v0.12.3 .",
    "we used the grade 0 - 12 events , giving slightly higher effective area at higher energies than the grade 0 events , and a 20 pixel ( 47.2 arcseconds ) radius circle to extract the source and background spectra using xselect v2.4a .",
    "the background extraction region chosen close to the source extraction region is the same for the three epochs s1 , s2 and s3 .",
    "no xmm - newton sources are present inside the background extraction region .",
    "the average background count rate is @xmath8 count s@xmath1 .",
    "the ancillary response files were created using xrtmkarf v0.5.6 and exposure maps generated by xrtexpomap v0.2.5 .",
    "we fitted all the spectra within xspec v12.5.0a using the response file swxpc0to12s6@xmath920070901v011.rmf , which includes an improvement of the soft energy response of the xrt @xcite ; which is essential for a source as soft as hlx-1 .",
    "the xrt monitoring revealed that hlx-1 was highly variable over the past 10 months with a drop in count rate by a factor of @xmath2 from s1 to s2 followed by a dramatic re - brightening by a factor of @xmath3 from s2 to s3 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the unfolded spectra for s1 ( black ) , s2 ( green ) and s3 ( red ) .",
    "the s1 and s3 spectra were binned to contain a minimum of 20 counts per channel , and were fitted using the @xmath10 minimisation technique .",
    "for all spectra , we fixed the absorption column at @xmath11 @xmath12 , the best constraint on @xmath13 derived by farrell et al .",
    "all the best - fit models and spectral parameters are given in table  [ tab1 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is immediately obvious that the source has varied significantly in flux . the results from s1 when fitted using an absorbed power - law appear to be consistent with those of xmm1 @xcite which showed a steep power - law , but are inconsistent with those of xmm2 ( @xmath10/dof=134/18 using the xmm2 best fit model ) even though the two observations were performed only a month apart .",
    "the addition of a disk black - body component to the power - law model does not significantly improve the fit ( @xmath14 ; which corresponds to a f - test probability of 30% ) .",
    "the use of a unique absorbed disk black - body does not give a good fit either ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the s3 spectrum is extremely soft . within the statistics of the xrt data ,",
    "the s3 spectrum is better fitted ( @xmath16 ) using a unique absorbed soft thermal emission than an absorbed power - law ( @xmath17 ) with a @xmath13-value fixed at @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the sparse counts in s2 ( 28 counts in the background - subtracted spectrum ) prevent us from performing any meaningful fitting analysis .",
    "instead , we prefer to use spectral hardness - ratios ( see below ) . nevertheless , folding through the _ swift_-xrt response kernel the s1 , xmm2 and s3 best - fit models multiplied by a constant factor gives adequate fits to the s2 data with a constant factor of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 erg s@xmath1 ) for s1 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 erg s@xmath1 ) for xmm2 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 erg s@xmath1 ) for s3 .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are the corresponding unabsorbed 0.2 - 10 kev luminosity . in all cases",
    ", the s2 luminosity appears to be much lower than those derived for xmm1 , xmm2 , s1 and s3 by at least a factor of 10 . for comparison ,",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the s2 spectrum ( green ) using a power - law with a fixed value of the photon index @xmath24 .",
    "the fitting results are suggestive of a series of spectral changes . to investigate this",
    ", we compared the total number of counts in three energy bands : 0.3 - 1 kev , 1 - 3 kev and 3 - 10 kev ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) . there is a significant drop ( by a factor of @xmath25 ) in the soft 0.3 - 1 kev band between s1 and s2 when compared to the 1 - 3 kev band .",
    "this suggests a hardening of the spectrum between s1 and s2 .",
    "the source was not detected above 3 kev in either the s2 or s3 data due to an overall low flux level in s2 and a steep spectral slope in s3 . from s2 to s3 , there is a significant increase in counts ( by a factor of @xmath26 ) in the 0.3 - 1 kev band when compared to the other bands , indicating that the x - ray spectrum has softened again ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the detection of the same spectral states as those observed in the gbhbs would be extremely valuable in constraining the nature of ulxs .",
    "spectra of other ulxs have been either interpreted as the source being in a low / hard state or in a very high state , even if the distinction between the two states is problematic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it appears that ulxs in the high / soft or thermal state are rare .",
    "thermal components with temperatures in the range kt = 1 - 1.5 kev have been observed in the spectra of some ulxs for an emitted luminosity @xmath27 erg s@xmath1 , placing them at the extreme end of stellar mass bhs @xcite .",
    "winter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) claimed the identification of several ulxs in the thermal state based on the detection of disk black - body ( dbb ) spectral components .",
    "however , in all cases , the dbb contribution was not significant with respect to the power - law component .",
    "moreover , no state transition as seen in gbhbs has been observed in ulxs even those showing large luminosity variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "claims for spectral state transitions , different from those seen in gbhbs have already been reported ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these papers , the authors claimed evidence for a high / hard to low / soft transition .",
    "recently , isobe et al . (",
    "2009 ) claimed evidence for a spectral transition in the ulx , ngc 2403 source 3 from a slim - disk state dominated by a @xmath28 kev disk black - body to a very high state dominated by a power - law spectrum .    when compared to other ulxs , hlx-1 is truly remarkable not only because its huge luminosity enables us to claim that it may harbour an imbh with a @xmath29m@xmath6 mass @xcite , but also because its luminosity - spectral variability as observed in x - rays ( see section 2 ) shows compelling evidence for spectral variation on short timescales ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) that are consistent with what has been observed in gbhbs like grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "indeed , hlx-1 was likely to be in the very high state in xmm1 & s1 , while the source was in the high / soft state in xmm2 with a dbb luminosity corresponding to 80% of the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "in this case , the transition has occurred in a 1 month window . in s2 ,",
    "the data suggest that the source may have been in the low / hard state .",
    "the re - brightening and spectral softening in s3 suggest that hlx-1 has returned to a high / soft state brighter than during xmm2 , the transition having occurred on a relatively short timescale ( @xmath30 days ) .",
    "the low - temperature of the dbb component measured in xmm2 and s3 is in the same range as those measured in some ulxs ( @xmath31 kev ; see * ? ? ?",
    "this thermal component is often interpreted as direct emission from the accretion disk .",
    "the dbb normalisation @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( via the inner radius of the accretion disk @xmath34 ) could then be used to constrain the bh mass . to do so",
    ", we assumed that @xmath34 corresponds to the radius of the last stable orbit around a non - rotating bh or a rotating bh with a maximum angular momentum ( i.e. @xmath35 with @xmath36 , the schwarzschild radius where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the bh mass , the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively ) .",
    "we found that the derived masses are in the range of imbh masses with @xmath40 from xmm2 and @xmath41 from s3 , where @xmath42 is the inclination of the disk with respect to the line of sight .    within the limited statistics of the xrt spectrum ,",
    "we have attempted to fit the highest quality spectrum ( s3 ) with the slim disk model ( kawaguchi 2003 ) . in order to reduce the number of free parameters , we freezed the source distance to 95 mpc and the viscosity parameter to three possible values ( 0.01 , 0.1 and 1 ) .",
    "the fits suggest a bh mass larger than @xmath43 m@xmath44 , thus adding another piece of evidence for the presence of an imbh in hlx-1 .",
    "we have presented the first evidence for spectral state transitions in hlx-1 , similar to those seen in gbhbs , strengthening the case for a black hole in the system . since multi - wavelength observations ( e.g. ir , radio ) of hlx-1 continue to exclude alternative explanations for hlx-1 , such as a foreground neutron star , or a background narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ( webb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , hlx-1 still provides the strongest evidence for the existence of imbhs in the universe .                                                           errors .",
    "the s2 0.2 - 10 kev unabsorbed luminosity was derived by folding through the _ swift_-xrt response kernel the s1 , xmm2 and s3 best - fit models multiplied by a constant factor ( see section 2 ) and taking the lowest ( @xmath45 erg s@xmath1 ) and highest ( @xmath19 erg s@xmath1 ) values .",
