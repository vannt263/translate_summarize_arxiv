    "<S> it is known that for any non - zero @xmath0 , if we roll the conic @xmath1 on a line in a plane , and then we rotate about this line the trace of a focus , then we obtain a surface of revolution @xmath2 with mean curvature 1 . if @xmath3 , @xmath2 is embedded and it is called unduloid , if @xmath4 , @xmath2 is not embedded and it is called nodoid . </S>",
    "<S> these surfaces are called delaunays and they are foliated by circles . the trace of the focus in the construction above is called the profile curve of the delaunay and it is transversal to the circles . </S>",
    "<S> another well known family of constant mean curvature surfaces are the twizzlers , they are foliated by helices and we can naturally define a profile curve which is transversal to the helices . to make the presentation in this abstract easier , we will be only considering twizzlers with mean curvature 1 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will prove that if we roll the profile curve of a twizzler on a line in a plane and , simultaneously , we move the points in the line at the same speed , so that the rolling motion of the profile curve looks like if it were placed on a treadmill , then , the trace made by the origin of the profile curve is one of the closed heart - shaped curves @xmath5 for some @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we have that , up to a rigid motion in @xmath8 , every twizzler is determined by its corresponding heart - shaped curve @xmath9 ; we will denote this twizzler by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we will prove the continuity of the map @xmath11 from @xmath12 to the set of immersions that sends , every point of the form @xmath13 to a cylinder of radius @xmath14 ; a real point @xmath15 to @xmath2 and , for any @xmath6 and @xmath16 , the point @xmath17 to @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this map @xmath11 is one - to - one in the interior of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> surfaces in the image under @xmath11 of the purely imaginary points in @xmath19 , that is , twizzlers associated with @xmath20 , contain the axis of symmetry and they are special in the sense that each one of these twizzlers is isometric to a nodoid and to an undoloid , more precisely : the undoloid @xmath21 , the twizzler @xmath22 and the nodoid @xmath23 are isometric . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we prove that for any @xmath24 , all the surfaces in the image of the curve @xmath25 defined in the interval @xmath26 are isometric . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this curve starts at an undoloid , then it passes through an twizzler that contains the axis of symmetry and then it ends with at a nodoid . </S>",
    "<S> we will prove that every twizzler that contains the axis of symmetry is contained in the interior of a cylinder of radius 1 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is either properly immersed with a discrete group of rotations acting on its isometry group , or it is dense . as an additional result , we prove that if we do the same rolling on a treadmill procedure to the profile curve of a flat surface with the same helicoidal symmetry as the twizzlers , then , the trace of the origin must lie in a line . </S>",
    "<S> we finish the paper by showing the .pdf version generated by the software mathematica of some of the programs that provide some pictures and animations showing property of twizzlers and delanunay surfaces . </S>"
