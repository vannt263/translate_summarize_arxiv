    "anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) were first detected in 1992 by the cobe satellite ( smoot et al .",
    "the amplitude and distribution of these temperature fluctuations are closely related to the underlying cosmological model .",
    "thus , a precision measurement of the cmbr fluctuations can in principle yield very precise information about the values of the fundamental cosmological parameters , @xmath0 etc .",
    "( see for instance bond et al .",
    "1994 , jungman et al.1996a , b , bond , efstathiou & tegmark 1997 , eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1999 ) .",
    "normally the fluctuations are parametrized in terms of spherical harmonics as @xmath1 where the @xmath2 coefficients are related to the power spectrum by @xmath3 . for purely gaussian fluctuations",
    "the power spectrum contains all statistical information about the fluctuations .",
    "the data from cobe are not sufficiently accurate for a useful determination of the cosmological parameters",
    ". however , a new generation of high - precision experiments will be able to do this .",
    "two balloon experiments , boomerang ( de bernardis et al . 2000 ) and maxima ( hanany et al . 2000 ) , have already measured the first and second acoustic peaks in the power spectrum ( up to @xmath4 ) . in the next few years",
    "there will be data of even better quality available from the map and planck satellite experiments .",
    "however , extracting precise information about the cosmological parameters means that we should be able to reliably calculate the theoretical fluctuation spectrum to at least as high precision as that of the best measurement .",
    "calculating the cmbr power spectrum is a very complicated issue .",
    "it involves solving the coupled boltzmann equations for all different particle species present .",
    "this framework has been described in great detail in many papers ( see e.g.  ma & bertschinger 1995 ) , and hu , scott , sugiyama & white ( 1995 ) for instance have discussed the influence of various physical assumptions on the final cmbr spectrum .    since photons",
    "exchange momentum and energy with the baryons , a core issue of any cmbr calculation is the treatment of the photon - baryon system .",
    "the photons mainly exchange energy with the baryons via thomson scattering on free electrons .",
    "the number of free electrons can be calculated by solving the recombination equations .",
    "these equations were first formulated by peebles ( 1968 ) and independently by zeldovich , kurt & sunyaev ( 1969 ) . until recently this treatment was used in all calculations of cmbr anisotropies , but it is only accurate to a few percent .",
    "recently seager , sasselov & scott ( 1999a , b ) have provided a much more accurate method for calculating recombination .",
    "however , one assumption which has been made consistently in all treatments is that electrons , protons and neutral hydrogen atoms are very tightly coupled and can exchange energy and momentum much faster than any other relevant timescale ( see e.g.  ma & bertschinger 1995 ) .",
    "this means that the photon - baryon system can be treated in a two - fluid approximation , where photons exchange energy with a baryon - fluid which is assumed to have infinitely strong self - interaction .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate interaction and energy - momentum exchange rates for the entire baryon - photon system , and write down the full set of boltzmann equations for the system of electron , ions , neutrals and photons . solving this system of equations",
    "we find that the assumption of a tightly coupled baryon fluid interacting with photons only through thomson scattering is a very good approximation , valid at the @xmath5 level .",
    "in section 2 we calculate the relevant rates for different processes , in section 3 we derive the boltzmann equations for a multi - fluid baryon plasma , and in section 4 we describe numerical results of solving this extended set of equations .",
    "finally , section 5 contains a discussion of our results .",
    "_ electrons  _ the main energy exchange mechanism between photons and electrons is thomson scattering .",
    "the scattering rate per photon is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the thomson scattering cross - section .",
    "relativistic corrections to the standard cross section are important at the @xmath8 level ( hu , scott , sugiyama & white 1995 )",
    ".    the other main photon - electron processes are bremsstrahlung and double compton scattering .",
    "the rates for these two processes are given roughly by ( hu & silk 1993a , b , lightman 1981 ) @xmath9 and @xmath10    _ ions  _ photons scatter on ions in exactly the same way as they do on electrons .",
    "however , because of the mass difference the cross section is much smaller @xmath11    _ neutrals  _ photon scattering on neutrals ( rayleigh scattering ) is characterised by the cross section ( jackson 1962 , lightman 1979 , peebles & yu 1970 ) @xmath12 if @xmath13 .",
    "this cross - section is energy dependent , but the thermal average of the cross section leads to a scattering rate of @xmath14 for @xmath15 ev .",
    "however , close to the epoch of recombination , the photons are not in scattering equilibrium ( hu & silk 1993a , b ) and the different photon modes do not exchange energy .",
    "therefore the energy dependence of rayleigh scattering can have different effects in different wavelength bands .",
    "we will return to this question in section 5 .",
    "_ photons  _ thomson scattering gives a rate per electron of @xmath16    _ ions ",
    "_ coulomb scattering on ions is characterized by the cross section @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the coulomb logarithm @xmath19 the scattering rate is then given by @xmath20 and inserting numbers gives a rate of @xmath21    in addition to coulomb scattering electrons and ions can recombine to neutral hydrogen .",
    "the rate for this process is given roughly by ( lightman 1979 , ma & bertschinger 1995 ) @xmath22 which is entirely negligible as a means of momentum transfer .",
    "_ neutrals  _ electron scattering on hydrogen atoms at low energy is primarily s - wave , so the cross - section is given by ( mott & massey 1965 ) @xmath23    the s - wave phase shift has been calculated for instance by schwartz ( 1961 ) . to a reasonable approximation",
    "we may put @xmath24 for @xmath25 . in that case",
    "the rate is @xmath26 inserting numbers into the above equation yields the rate @xmath27      we have already seen that thomson scattering is negligible for protons .",
    "the coulomb scattering rate is the same as for electrons .",
    "scattering on neutrals is very inefficient because of the much higher mass of protons compared with electrons . finally , the recombination rate is the same for protons as it is for electrons .",
    "we shall in the present paper assume that all neutral hydrogen is in the ground state , an approximation which is very good for our purposes .",
    "_ photons  _ the rayleigh scattering rate has been calculated above to be @xmath28    photo - ionization of neutral hydrogen could in principle also be important . the rate for this process is given by ( ma & bertschinger 1995 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the binding energy of the given level and @xmath31 . for ionization from the ground state",
    "this is approximately @xmath32 finally , neutral hydrogen can also absorb momentum from the photon gas via photo - excitation . during recombination",
    "the ly-@xmath33 line is densely populated by resonance photons ( peebles 1968 ) .",
    "this effective non - thermal distribution function across the line we denote with @xmath34 . in terms of this",
    "the photo - excitation rate from the ground state is @xmath35 from the recombination calculation we find @xmath34 and thus @xmath36 .",
    "the system of equations we use is that provided by peebles ( peebles 1968 ) . although it is not as accurate as that of seager , sasselov & scott ( 1999a , b ) , it is adequate for our purpose .",
    "note that photo - excitation does not in itself transfer any momentum between hydrogen and the other species .",
    "almost all photons in the line are resonance photons and not thermal background photons .",
    "however , hydrogen in excited states is ionized almost completely and so the above rate can be seen effectively as the rate for converting hydrogen and @xmath37 .",
    "_ electrons  _ scattering on electrons is by far the most important means of exchanging momentum with other species . the rate is roughly given by ( c.f .",
    "( [ eq : nscatter ] ) ) @xmath38    _ ions ",
    "_ scattering on ions is by s - wave scattering exactly as for electrons .",
    "however , the cross section is much smaller because of the much higher mass of protons .",
    "the coulomb interaction between electrons and ions is already the dominant reaction rate in the plasma .",
    "however , as soon as there is any motion of electrons relative to ions , an electric field quickly builds up and acts in the direction opposite to the motion ( hogan 2000 ) .",
    "thus , electrons and ions are even more tightly coupled than the coulomb scattering suggests and effectively this means that electrons and protons can be treated as one tightly coupled species .      from the above equations we can compare the different rates and identify the dominant ones for momentum exchange between the different species .",
    "however , the above equations describe the scattering rates , not the rates for momentum transfer between different species .",
    "these two quantities are to a good approximation equivalent , except in the case where photons scatter on massive particles . because photons have very low momenta compared with massive particles , they are inefficient at transferring momentum to these particles . in each scattering ,",
    "the photon on average loses a large fraction of its momentum , whereas the massive particle only loses a fraction @xmath39 of its momentum .",
    "this effect is only important for the processes described in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "both these equations should be multiplied by a factor @xmath40 to find the rate of momentum transfer .",
    "when this is done , all rates are momentum transfer rates and can be directly compared .",
    "1 shows the different rates as a function of time . from the figure it is clear which processes we need to include , they are : + 1 ) thomson scattering which couples photons with the ion - electron plasma + 2 ) rayleigh scattering which couples photons with neutral hydrogen + 3 ) s - wave scattering which couples the ion - electron fluid with neutral hydrogen ( this process is dominant for @xmath41 ) .",
    "the evolution of different particle species can be described via the boltzmann equation . in deriving the equations below we shall work in synchronous gauge because the numerical code for calculating cmbr power spectra , cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) , is written in this gauge . as the time variable",
    "we use conformal time @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the scale factor .",
    "finally , instead of using physical momentum , @xmath44 , we work with comoving momentum , @xmath45 , because it is a conserved quantity in the expanding universe .",
    "finally , we parametrize it as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the magnitude and @xmath48 is a 3-vector describing its direction .",

    "let us define the density and pressure perturbations of the dark matter fluid as ( ma & bertschinger 1995 ) @xmath67 then energy and momentum conservation implies that ( ma & bertschinger 1995 ) @xmath68 by integrating eq .",

    "the baryon - photon system is coupled by interactions , so @xmath71 \\neq 0 $ ] . in the standard treatment , where all baryons are assumed to be",
    "infinitely tightly coupled to each other , there are only two boltzmann equations , one for the photons and one for the baryons ( ma & bertschinger 1995 ) . the baryons are highly non - relativistic and we need only consider the first two terms in the boltzmann hierarchy , corresponding to energy and momentum . for photons many more terms need to be incorporated . however , in the present treatment we suppress writing out explicitly these higher order terms .",
    "the collision term for the system has been calculated many times in the literature and the collisional boltzmann equations are ( ma & bertschinger 1995 )    _ baryons : _ @xmath72    _ photons : _ @xmath73 the full hierarchy can be found for instance in ma and bertschinger ( 1995 )",
    ".    in our case , instead of an infinitely tightly coupled baryon - electron fluid we have three interacting `` species '' : electrons ( @xmath74 ) , ions ( @xmath75 ) and neutrals ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "this means that 4 different boltzmann hierarchies have to be solved simultaneously . as discussed in section 3 , the electrons and ions can be considered as infinitely tightly coupled because of charge neutrality .",
    "this ion - electron fluid we denote by the subscript @xmath77 .",
    "the boltzmann hierarchy is now    _ ion - electron fluid : _ @xmath78    _ neutrals : _ @xmath79    _ photons : _",
    "@xmath80    here @xmath81 denotes the thermally averaged rayleigh cross section . in the equations for @xmath82 for neutrals and ions",
    ", there is a new term appearing because ions and neutrals can interconvert .",
    "@xmath83 can be found from solving the unperturbed boltzmann equation ( kaplinghat et al .",
    "1999 ) , which in the present case is the recombination equation .",
    "solving the above system of equations is quite complicated , but we can easily estimate the importance of the different terms . the first important term is the interaction between neutrals and electrons / ions . we can estimate the relative velocity difference between these two components as @xmath84 thus , the relative velocity building up between neutrals and electrons / ions is at most of @xmath85 .",
    "this correction is exceedingly small and we can to a very good approximation treat neutrals and electrons - ions as infinitely tightly coupled . in that case",
    "the above system of equations almost reduces to that in the standard treatment    _ baryons : _ @xmath86    _ photons _ @xmath87 except for the fact that rayleigh scattering is now included this form is identical to the standard treatment .",
    "note that the polarization terms for photons are different for rayleigh scattering compared with for thomson scattering because rayleigh scattering corresponds to scattering in a dipole field ( see e.g.  jackson 1962 ) .",
    "however , this is a higher order effect which is we shall not discuss further in the present paper .    thus , the corrections to the standard treatment come almost solely from including rayleigh scattering in the calculations of the temperature power spectrum .",
    "we have modified the cmbfast code to include the effect of rayleigh scattering . in fig .",
    "2 we show how the cmbr temperature power spectrum changes due to this inclusion .",
    "the difference between the two spectra increases with @xmath88 , but is always below @xmath5 . since the absolute accuracy of cmbfast is only about 1% , one might worry that the effect is due to numerical noise .",
    "however , the effect shown in fig .  2 is a differential effect , and the accuracy of cmbfast should therefore be substantially better .",
    "= 12truecm    it is in fact possible from analytic arguments , to understand how the inclusion of rayleigh scattering dampens the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "three effects contribute to change the cmbr power spectrum : 1 ) diffusion damping of the perturbations close to recombination is changed by including rayleigh scattering , 2 ) the last scattering surface is moved to slightly lower redshift , so that @xmath89 is higher .",
    "this means that the early isw effect is less important , and suppresses power around the horizon size at recombination .",
    "3 ) since the last scattering surface is moved to lower redshift , @xmath90 , is also higher . this parameter changes the amplitude of the acoustic oscillations ( hu 1995 ) .",
    "the first effect is the most important and can to a reasonable precision be calculated analytically .",
    "the diffusion damping of the @xmath56-space fluctuation spectrum can be written roughly as ( hu 1995 ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 here , @xmath93 is the differential optical depth , and @xmath94 is the diffusion scale for a photon .",
    "@xmath60 is the conformal time coordinate , @xmath95 .",
    "we then use the approximate relation that @xmath96 to write that @xmath97    = 7truecm    this damping factor is shown as a function of @xmath88 in fig .",
    "it quite nicely agrees with both the magnitude and shape of the damping seen in the numerically calculated spectrum ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the oscillatory behaviour of the damping in fig .",
    "2 comes from the fact that the parameter @xmath98 is changed ( hu 1995 , landau , harari and zaldarriaga 2000 ) , so that the oscillation amplitudes are different when rayleigh scattering is included .",
    "thus , the behaviour of the fluctuation damping due to rayleigh scattering , seen in fig .",
    "2 , is understandable in terms of simple physical arguments .",
    "we have thoroughly reviewed the interactions between different particle species in the baryon - photon plasma during recombination , as well as written down the complete set of boltzmann equations for the system of photons , electrons , ions and neutrals . in the standard cmbr calculations ,",
    "the entire baryon plasma is treated as infinitely tightly coupled to itself .",
    "we find that the error introduced by this assumption is only at the @xmath99 level .",
    "the main error in the standard treatment is that rayleigh scattering between photons and neutral hydrogen is neglected .",
    "however , the difference in the power spectrum when this process is included is at most of @xmath100 , even at high @xmath88 .",
    "the benchmark for any cmbr calculation is the best possible precision with which any measurement can be made . because the ensemble average needed in calculating @xmath101 in practise has to be replaced with an average over @xmath102",
    "there is an uncertainty in @xmath101 of @xmath103 which corresponds to the best precision any cmbr measurement can be made to .",
    "even at @xmath104 this `` cosmic variance '' is @xmath105 , which is an order of magnitude higher than the error introduced by neglecting rayleigh scattering , and several orders of magnitude larger than the error introduced by treating neutrals and ions / electrons as infinitely tightly coupled .",
    "notice , however , that this calculation has been performed using a thermally averaged rayleigh cross section .",
    "since photons with different energy do not exchange energy at recombination ( hu & silk 1993a , b ) , this different rayleigh interaction rate can lead to different fluctuation spectra in different wavelength bands .",
    "a full calculation of this effect requires solving the momentum dependent boltzmann equation for the photon gas ( ma & bertschinger 1995 ) , and is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , one can get a rough feeling for how the effect of rayleigh scattering scales with photon energy .",
    "= 7truecm    in fig .",
    "4 we show the effect on the power spectrum in the case where the rayleigh scattering is increased by factors of @xmath106 and @xmath107 above the value for the average photon energy . in this case , the effect can be very significant and above the detection threshold . to compare with observations ,",
    "the highest frequency channel of the planck surveyor is at 857 ghz ( see http://astro.estec.esa.nl/planck/ ) , which corresponds to @xmath108 . )",
    "correspond to @xmath109 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rayleigh ] ) does not apply at such high energy during recombination .",
    "the upper limit for the cross section would rather be @xmath110 , which corresponds better to the case of @xmath111 , shown in fig .  4 .",
    "] so for the planck surveyor it is not impossible that the effect at high frequencies could be detectable .",
    "however , this simplistic analysis clearly overestimates the effect , because increasing the general rayleigh scattering by a certain amount implicitly assumes that all photons have more energy , which is not really the case .",
    "a real calculation using the momentum dependent boltzmann equation would likely find a somewhat smaller effect , which could nevertheless still be significant at high energy .",
    "a second point is that the high frequency bands are subject to heavy foreground contamination ( tegmark et al . 2000 ) , so that a cosmological signal would probably not be visible .",
    "use of the cmbfast package for calculating cmbr anisotropies ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) is acknowledged ."
