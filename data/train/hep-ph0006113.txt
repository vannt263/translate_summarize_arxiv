    "the functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 can be expressed as follows : @xmath7 we can use unsubtracted dispersion relations , because the integrals contained in @xmath5 , @xmath6 are convergent , since these functions are multiplied by three and two powers of momentum , respectively .",
    "+ the imaginary part of the invariant scalar functions can be derived from the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram , calculated by cutting the diagram as shown in fig .",

    "the method above allows a more direct treatment , since we avoid evaluating divergent integrals and introducing regularization schemes .",
    "+ the fact that the axial anomaly can be derived without using the renormalization procedure , suggests that this should not be considered as the only origin of the anomalous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "moreover , by studying the axial anomaly with the renormalization procedure , that is by considering its ultraviolet interpretation , an important aspect of this phenomenon remains obscure and we are bound by a formal derivation only .",
    "as stressed in @xcite and @xcite , the dispersive approach shows that the anomaly is related to the chiral limit and therefore , it can be interpreted as an infrared effect . in this work",
    "we are close to this infrared interpretation , which , as we will see , can help to shed light on some aspects of the physics connected to the axial anomaly .",
    "+ let us briefly discuss the physics involved in the amplitudes contributing to the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram .",
    "the two born diagrams , obtained from the cut of the triangular diagram ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , describe the following two processes :    1 .   the production of a fermion - antifermion pair ( for example @xmath11 ) by an axial - vector source ; 2 .",
    "the subsequent annihilation of the pair into two real photons .",
    "in both these processes there occur helicity flips , thus the chirality is not conserved in the zero mass limit .",
    "+ let us go to the center of mass frame of the two final photons . in the first process the axial - vector source produces an @xmath11 pair of total spin zero , since a spin 1 state can not annihilate into a two real photons state .",
    "thus @xmath12 and @xmath13 must have the same helicity and hence opposite chirality in the massless limit . in the process",
    "b ) the @xmath11 pair annihilates into two real photons by going through an intermediate virtual state .",
    "there are four possible virtual states @xcite : one is drawn in fig .",
    "3    c    [ fig3 ]    ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the @xmath13 and @xmath12 linear momenta ) , a second one is obtained by reversing the virtual state helicity ; the remaining two are obtained replacing the outgoing virtual fermion with an incoming virtual antifermion .",
    "let us study the case shown in fig . 3 and assume that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are both right - handed . in the vertex b the chirality is conserved in the massless limit , while in the vertex a there is an helicity flip , thus the chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "as can be easily checked , for all the remaining virtual states we always have an allowed vertex and a forbidden one .",
    "+ at the born level , these reactions are described by the classical qed lagrangian , which , in the @xmath16 limit , is invariant under chiral transformations .",
    "thus it seems at first sight that the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram , being proportional to the product of amplitudes relative to processes forbidden by chiral invariance , vanishes . on the contrary",
    ", one sees that taking the limit @xmath16 in ( [ g2 ] ) gives a finite result @xcite : @xmath17 therefore , by studying the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram , one establishes that a non - conservation of helicity occurs , becoming , in the massless limit , a non - conservation of chirality .",
    "we interpret this as related to the presence of the anomalous term in the divergence of the axial - vector current .",
    "thus the axial anomaly can be derived by studying the properties of the amplitude in the infrared region .",
    "+ even if in this work we will analyse the cancellation of mass singularities in polarized processes , we will not discuss the physical implication of the zero fermion mass limit .",
    "+ as stated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the result in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) indicates that there occurs a cancellation of the suppression factor @xmath18 , due to the terms coming from the vertices with helicity flip . in ( [ g1 ] )",
    "the logarithmic factor conspires to give a finite result .",
    "this logarithm is a collinear one ; we shall discuss about this kind of logarithms in section [ mass ] .",
    "its presence is a manifestation of the singularity occurring in the fermion propagator as @xmath16 , which exactly cancels the suppression factor @xmath18 in the numerator . + we observe that the behaviour of the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram  given in eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) shows that the @xmath16 limit is not smooth ; if we evaluate the amplitudes with the massless theory , they identically vanish . if , on the contrary , we take the chiral limit after summing their product over the intermediate states , we obtain a result different from zero .",
    "in the process b ) contributing to the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram  a charged polarized fermion , changes helicity by emitting a photon .",
    "thanks to the collinear singularity within the propagator relative to this fermion , the chiral suppression factor @xmath18 is cancelled and the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram   does nt vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "+ let us now extend these remarks to physical processes having the same features as the ones characterizing the absorbitive part of the triangular diagram .",
    "this means that we want to investigate about a manifestation of the axial anomaly in reactions where a fermion changes helicity by emitting a photon .",
    "we call these processes helicity changing processes .",
    "they have been considered by lee and nauenberg @xcite , who observed that states with opposite helicity do nt decouple in the massless limit , provided that this limit is taken after having summed the transition probability over the final phase space . in the process",
    "b ) the incoming @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in a definite helicity state , as discussed above . in the reactions we want to study ,",
    "we calculate the probability that an outgoing fermion assumes an helicity opposite to the one required by the interaction before the emission of the photon . in other words ,",
    "we evaluate the probability that in the fermion - photon vertex occurs an helicity flip . according to the dolgov and zakharov analysis",
    ", we interpret the presence of a term independent of the fermion mass in the corresponding cross sections as a manifestation of the axial anomaly .",
    "due to this term , the probability for a process with helicity flip does nt vanish in the chiral limit . +      we first examine the non radiative pion decay @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an antilepton ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 is the associated neutrino . at the born level",

    "is coupled to a left - handed lepton .",
    "we calculate the probability that the lepton flips its helicity and becomes right - handed , by emitting a real photon .",
    "+ the amplitude describing the radiative pion decay can be divided into two parts , the inner bremsstrahlung and the structure dependent amplitudes @xcite : @xmath38 the inner bremsstrahlung amplitude , where the photon is radiated from the external charged particles , can be calculated using the rules of qed , with a point like pion coupling ; the structure - dependent amplitude is governed by the strong interactions .",

    "finally , at this order in perturbation theory , we retain terms of all powers in the lepton mass .",
    "we will argue that the manifestation of the axial anomaly is strictly connected to these terms .",

    "these divergences are called collinear singularities .",
    "+ if we keep the fermion mass finite and integrate over the photon emission angle , the collinear divergence does nt occur , but the possibility of a divergence in the limit @xmath81 results in the presence of the collinear logarithms , that is logarithms of the form @xmath82 , diverging for @xmath16 . + in the case of collinear singularities , the theorem by kinoshita , lee and nauenberg @xcite guarantees that these divergences cancel out if we sum the transition probability over the set of degenerate states , order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "this cancellation mechanism is analogous to that of the infrared divergences , as stated by the block - nordsieck theorem .",

    "the decay rate ( [ ibl ] ) is also infrared divergent , as one can verify by taking the limit @xmath113 . in this case",
    "we do nt have the constraint constituted by the helicity flip in the photon - lepton vertex and in the pion vertex the angular momentum is conserved for soft and virtual photon emission .",
    "thus , in the left - handed case , the mass singularity cancellation occurs in the ordinary way , as in the unpolarized case , i.e. in the total inclusive decay rate , obtained by adding all the order @xmath83 contributions . + let us show how the cancellation takes place .",
    "as we have already seen ( eq .",
    "( [ bornpol ] ) ) , in the born @xmath0 decay the outgoing lepton is left - handed , due to angular momentum conservation .",
    "thus the unpolarized and the left - handed born decay rate coincide : @xmath114 because of the factorization with respect to the born decay rate , also the unpolarized and the left - handed virtual contributions are equal : @xmath115 expressing the left - handed inner bremsstrahlung contribution in terms of the unpolarized and the right - handed ones , the total contribution to order @xmath83 to the left - handed process is given by : @xmath116 the expression ( [ totl ] ) is finite both in the infrared and in the collinear limit , because the mass singularities present in the terms between brackets cancel each other , as we have seen ( see eq .",
    "( [ tot ] ) and @xmath117 is free from mass singularities .",
    "+ let us now discuss the origin of these different cancellation mechanisms .",
    "the presence of mass singularities is a consequence of the fact that the states of a theory containing massless particles are highly degenerate .",
    "the kln theorem states that the mass singularities disappear from the transition probability when we average it over the ensemble of degenerate states .",
    "this theorem contains the block - nordsieck theorem as a special case , when we consider only the cancellation of the infrared divergences .",
    "+ we can define two degeneration ensembles , one relative to the infrared divergences and one relative to the collinear singularities .",
    "we call them the infrared and the collinear ensembles , respectively .",
    "if we sum the transition probability over the states contained in the former , the infrared divergences cancel out and if we average it over the latter , we obtain a quantity free from both infrared and collinear singularities .",
    "the infrared ensemble is the one prescribed by the block - nordsieck theorem , while the second is the one prescribed by the kln theorem and contains the first as a subset .",
    "+ let us now examine how the infrared and collinear ensemble are composed for the radiative pion decay in the cases of unpolarized , left - handed and right - handed outgoing lepton .",
    "this discussion concerns the issue of the degeneration of states already addressed for the unpolarized case @xcite .",
    "this issue in the case of helicity changing processes presents peculiar features .",
    "+ we have seen in section [ pion ] that in the unpolarized and left - handed inner bremsstrahlung contributions there are mass singularities , indicating that we have not summed the transition probability over the entire ensemble of degenerate states . in these cases",
    "the infrared ensemble contains , to order @xmath83 , the state with a pion , a charged lepton and a neutrino and all the other states differing from this for the presence of a soft virtual or real photon , i.e. a photon with an energy @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is an infrared cut off , tipically the measurement apparatus resolution .",
    "the collinear ensemble is constituted by all the states of the infrared ensemble plus the states with a hard photon moving parallel to the pion or the lepton . clearly the degeneration arises in the limit @xmath120 . + according to the kln theorem the fact that @xmath103 is finite both in the infrared and in the collinear limits means that in the right - handed case , calculating the differential decay rate ( i.e. summing over the photon polarization and integrating over the photon energy and emission angle ) , we have already averaged over the set of degenerate states relative to this process .",
    "let us now consider how the degeneration ensemble for the right - handed radiative decay is composed . to obtain @xmath121",
    "we have not averaged over the infrared subspace of the collinear ensemble , but this is enough to render the transition probability free from mass singularities .",
    "indeed in this case the infrared ensemble is empty , owing to the constraints imposed both by the angular momentum conservation in the pion vertex and by the helicity flip in the photon - lepton vertex .",
    "thus in this case the degeneration ensemble contains only the states with the outgoing lepton accompanied by hard collinear photons .",
    "+ we conclude that imposing to the outgoing lepton a polarization opposed to the one prescribed by the vertex preceding the photon emission , implies a reduction of the degeneration subspace .",
    "this fact has two consequences : the first is that both the infrared and the collinear limits are finite and the second is that these limits are disconnected , since the collinear degeneration subspace is constituted only by the states with the pion and the outgoing lepton accompanied by hard collinear photons .",
    "thus in this case we have a particular application of the kln theorem .",
    "+      in the radiative pion decay , due to the angular momentum conservation in the pion vertex , there is no room for a right - handed lepton .",
    "for such a channel , soft and virtual photon contributions are zero .",
    "this result is valid independently of the lepton mass .",
    "+ let us now consider a more general case , by loosing the value of the angular momentum of the decaying state .",
    "as an example , we study the radiative @xmath1 decay in a lepton - antilepton @xmath122 pair , in which the lepton is in a definite helicity state .",
    "+ the @xmath1-leptons vertex is : @xmath123 with @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the weinberg angle and @xmath126 is the @xmath1 mass .",
    "+ we have chosen this process , since , by varying the constants @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we can control the structure of the @xmath1-leptons coupling ; thus it is possible to point out the role played by the conservation law occurring in this vertex in the chiral limit in the collinear singularity cancellation .",
    "if we set @xmath129 , we require that in the limit of zero lepton mass , the @xmath1 couples to a left - handed lepton .",
    "+ we calculate the decay rate for the process in which the lepton is right - handed . at the born level this is given by : @xmath130 - 2g_vg_a(1 - 4r ) \\bigg\\}. \\label{bornz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if in eq .",

    "7 must be added . for the purpose of the polarized amplitude , however , the helicity flip contribution of the diagram b ) of fig .",
    "7 gives zero in the massless limit and is therefore negligible in our discussion .",
    "+ from now on we consider the case @xmath129 , to have the condition of chirality conservation in the @xmath1 vertex for @xmath120 . taking this limit in eq .",
    "( [ rz ] ) , we see that @xmath138 does not vanish : @xmath139 the result of this limit is the contribution related to the axial anomaly , which has the same form of the one found in the pion case .",
    "+ let us now discuss the mass singularities cancellation mechanism for the @xmath1 decay case .",
    "if we keep the lepton mass different from zero , the helicity is not fixed by the interaction occurring before the photon emission , even if we set @xmath129 .",
    "thus , for @xmath140 , the soft and virtual photons contribution are different from zero and diverge in the infrared limit .",
    "indeed , if we let the lepton energy reach its kinematical limit , @xmath141 , we see that @xmath138 diverges .",
    "we expect the infrared divergences to cancel , if we add all the first order contributions , given by the diagrams of fig .",
    "6 and 7    c    [ fig7 ]    and calculate the totally inclusive decay rate .",
    "( [ collz ] ) shows that the collinear limit gives a finite result .",
    "thus , we conclude that , as in the case of the radiative pion decay , evaluating @xmath138 we have already summed over all the collinear degeneration subspace . as a consequence ,",
    "the collinear and infrared limit are disconnected .",
    "+ if we take the limit @xmath142 in eq .",
    "( [ collz ] ) , we obtain : @xmath143 in general , if a quantity is finite in the collinear limit , it is finite also in the infrared limit , since the collinear subspace contains the infrared one .",
    "( [ irz ] ) indicates that in the massless limit the soft photon contribution is zero .",
    "indeed , it is factorized with respect to the born decay rate , which , for @xmath104 and @xmath129 , vanishes . as we have discussed in section [ anomaly ] , the presence of the anomalous term is directly connected to the emission of the photon , hence it vanishes in the infrared limit . + the virtual photon contribution vanishes in the zero mass limit , as well .",
    "indeed , it is factorized respect to the born decay rate , which goes to zero as @xmath104 .",
    "the virtual correction factor can produce only a logarithmic collinear singularity , not a power - like one , needed for the cancellation of the chiral suppression .",
    "+ we observe that taking the infrared limit @xmath144 in eq .",
    "( [ hf ] ) , gives a finite result ( indeed the cross section vanishes ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the cross section ( [ hf ] ) has been calculated to the leading order in the lepton mass . from the eq .",
    "( [ rz ] ) , we see that , for @xmath145 , the infrared divergent term is given by : @xmath146 and it is proportional to the lepton mass . performing the calculation , neglecting the mass terms , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , means imposing the chirality conservation law in the @xmath1 vertex ; thus the soft photon contribution is zero and the infrared divergences disappear . to the leading order in the lepton mass",
    ", we have only the anomalous term , which vanishes in the infrared limit . +",
    "as done for the pion case , we now examine the composition of the degeneration ensembles for the radiative @xmath1 decay with the right - handed lepton .",
    "( [ irz ] ) indicates that , in the chiral limit , the soft photons do nt contribute to the process with the right - handed outgoing lepton , since , not carrying spin , they can not contribute to the helicity flip .",
    "+ as we have already said , the virtual photon contribution vanishes in the zero mass limit . in the limit @xmath120 ,",
    "also the diagram with the photon emitted by @xmath147 does nt contribute , since , clearly , it violates the chirality conservation in the @xmath1 vertex .",
    "+ the collinear degeneration arises in the massless limit .",
    "the result ( [ collz ] ) shows that , in this limit , the collinear ensemble is constituted only by the states with the lepton accompanied by hard collinear photons , just as in the case of the pion decay .",

    "we have shown that the dolgov and zakharov treatment of the axial anomaly can be extended to processes characterized by a lepton which changes helicity by emitting a photon , as it was already noticed in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay rates do nt vanish in the chiral limit , due to a term independent of the lepton mass ; we interpret the presence of this term as related to the axial anomaly .",
    "this can be seen as a signal of the anomalous symmetry breaking in processes different from the usual ones , like the @xmath3 decay .",
    "+ we have computed the rates corresponding to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 radiative decays .",
    "we have analysed their infrared and collinear limits .",
    "it results essential to keep the terms of all orders in the lepton mass , since the cancellation of the infrared and collinear divergences takes place among these terms .",
    "we have examined the connection between the polarization of the outgoing leptons and the application of the kln theorem .",
    "+ we have shown that for the helicity changing processes the cancellation of the collinear singularities occurs through a mechanism different from the usual one of real and virtual compensation .",
    "the coefficients in front of the collinear terms go to zero in the chiral limit , producing the finiteness of the distribution .",
    "we have found , however , a difference between the pion case and the more general case of the @xmath1 decay .",
    "the former represents a particular case due to the angular momentum conservation in the pion vertex . as a consequence ,",
    "the virtual and real soft photon contribution are zero , even if the lepton mass is kept different from zero .",
    "the inner bremsstrahlung contribution is finite both in the infrared and in the collinear limits .",
    "+ in the @xmath1 case , the decay rate diverges in the infrared limit , since , for @xmath140 , the soft photon contributions are not zero .",
    "however in the collinear limit , the result is finite , despite the fact that the collinear degenerate states arise only in the zero lepton mass limit . in this limit",
    "the virtual and real soft photon contributions do vanish . in order to make the collinear limit finite , it is therefore sufficient to sum over degenerate states made of the changing helicity lepton accompanied by a hard collinear photon .",
    "the transition probability becomes finite after summing over the photon final phase space .",
    "+ we noticed that in the helicity changing processes the collinear limit results disconnected from the infrared one .",
    "the contributions coming from the virtual photon emission and from the emission of photons by particles different from the one changing helicity , are zero .",
    "+ this situation is due to the fact that the born part of the process fixes the fermion chirality in the zero mass limit , while , after the photon emission , it is in a state of opposite chirality ; this reduces the collinear ensemble .",
    "+ we conclude that the collinear singularity cancellation mechanism for helicity changing processes is controlled by the anomalous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "the axial anomaly implies that the collinear limit gives a finite result , independent of the fermion mass .",
