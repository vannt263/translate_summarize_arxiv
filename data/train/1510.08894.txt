    "striking feature of these magnetization curves is a very large narrow jump of the magnetization at zero field . in the past",
    "such jumps have only been seen in a large magnetic field due to the phenomenon of magnetic deflagration @xcite .",

    "a single exponential provides a good fit to the time dependence of the magnetic moment of the sample at all temperatures explored ( 2.0k2.8k ) , with mean lifetimes ranging from 438s to 1530s approximately .",
    "this means that a single energy barrier contributes to the relaxation .",
    "it is determined by the distance from the ground state level @xmath29 to the level @xmath30 that dominates thermally assisted quantum tunneling , see fig .",
    "[ fig spin - tunneling ] .",

[ fig hysteresis ] increases sharply with a relatively small increase of temperature .     during a stepwise field sweep at @xmath37k.,width=359 ]    an additional proof of the landau - zener dynamics of the magnetization comes from the analysis of the experiment in which the field sweep near zero field on a field reduction from saturation was conducted in equal field steps , with a sizable magnetization change after each step and a little change between the steps . for two consecutive steps one has @xmath38 where @xmath39 has been used . writing @xmath40 as @xmath41 , one obtains after @xmath42 steps @xmath43 resulting in @xmath44 .",
    "the linear time dependence of @xmath45 observed in experiment is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig lz ] .",
    "the width of the zero - field resonance is determined by the inhomogeneous broadening due to dipole - dipole interaction between magnetic moments of the mn@xmath0 molecules and due to hyperfine interactions that are rather strong in mn@xmath0 .",
    "strong dipolar broadening in conventional tetragonal crystals of mn@xmath0 acetate is due to the tendency of the molecules to form ordered chains along the tetragonal c - axis .",
    "this tendency should be greatly diminished in the triclinic structure . in the new crystal phase of mn@xmath0 acetate reported here the magnetic moments of the molecules do not form chains , see fig . [ fig arrangement ] .",
    "still it appears unlikely that the dipolar broadening in the ribbons would fall below @xmath11oe .",

    "the moments do not form chains along a single magnetic anisotropy axis .",
    ", width=340 ]    even if the dipolar broadening of the resonance was very low , the question would remain about the absence of the hyperfine broadening , which should be of the order of a few hundred oe .",
    "one possible explanation to the data is provided by recent theoretical work that shows that the magnetization reversal in a molecular magnet may occur inside a front of quantum tunneling moving through the sample .",
    "this may happen either due to the formation of a domain wall with a zero dipolar bias inside the wall @xcite or due to the formation of a self - organized front of quantum tunneling with zero bias between tunneling spin levels regardless of the nature of inhomogeneous broadening @xcite .",
    "the latter effect presents the most interesting possibility .",
    "it is similar to the optical laser effect : the dipolar field in a system of magnetic dipoles self - organizes to provide the fastest relaxation to the minimum energy state .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that self - organization of dipolar field can provide the resonant condition in the presence of a very significant ( up to 25% ) broadening of the energy of spin levels .",
    "further studies will reveal if self - organization is the reason for the observed narrow zero - field resonance .",
    "if it is , it may open the way of lasing with molecular magnets in the terahertz frequency range .",
