    "nonadiabatic transition due to potential curve crossing is one of the most important mechanisms to effectively induce electronic transitions @xcite .",
    "this is a very interdisciplinary concept and appears in almost all fields of physics and chemistry , even in biology @xcite .",
    "the common examples are variety of atomic and molecular processes such as atomic and molecular collisions , chemical reactions and molecular spectroscopic processes .",
    "attempts have been made to classify organic reactions by curve crossing diagrams @xcite .",
    "there are also examples in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "two state curve crossing can be classified into the following two cases according to the crossing scheme : ( 1 ) landau - zener ( l.z ) case , in which the two diabatic potential curves has the same signs for the slopes and ( 2 ) non - adiabatic tunnelling ( n.t ) case , in which the diabatic curves has the opposite sign of slopes . in our earlier paper @xcite paper",
    "we have considered two diabatic curves , crossing each other and there is a coupling between the two curves , which causes transitions from one curve to another .",
    "this transition would occur in the vicinity of the crossing point .",
    "in particular , it will occur in a narrow range of x , given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the nuclear coordinate and @xmath2 is the crossing point . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are determined by the shape of the diabatic curves and @xmath5 represent the coupling between them .",
    "therefore it is interesting to analyse a model , where coupling is localized in space near @xmath2 .",
    "thus we put @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "this model has the advantage that it can be exactly solved @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply this model in the case of general multi - channel problems ( fig .",
    "[ mcurve ] ) , since this is very important in view of the applications to various practical problems in chemical dynamics beyond simple diatomic systems .",
    "using model potential in which one linear diabatic potential intersects many constant diabatic potentials , demkov and osherov @xcite showed that the state to state transition probabilities can be exactly calculated by a product of the landau - zener probabilities at each crossing .",
    "a more general model , in which one set of parallel linear diabatic potentials intersect with another set of parallel ones , has been analyzed by child @xcite .",
    "korsch @xcite reported multi - state curve crossing problems by the magnus approximation , and later nakamura @xcite analyzed the problems by complex phase - integral technique . in the following we give a general procedure for finding the exact quantum mechanical solution for multi - channel curve crossing problem by extending our two state model @xcite",
    "the time dependent schr@xmath8 dinger equation ( we take @xmath9 here and in subsequent calculations ) @xmath10 @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the probability amplitude for the two states .",
