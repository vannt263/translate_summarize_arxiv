    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is widely considered as the leading proposal to address the hierarchy problem in the standard model .",
    "the simplest realization of susy , the mininal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , is without a doubt the most popular extension of the standard model in the last three decades . although a theoretically very appealing concept , susy has remained elusive in experimental searches despite tremendous amount of efforts .",
    "the non - discovery of any new particles or the higgs boson to date introduces a certain amount of fine - tuning in the electroweak sector of mssm @xcite and creates a somewhat awkward situation given susy s promise to solve the electroweak hierarchy problem .",
    "there is , however , a particular region in the parameter space of mssm where the fine - tuning in the higgs mass is reduced .",
    "it is the region where the overall stop mass scale is light at several hundreds gev and the mixing in the stop sector is maximized due to a large trilinear soft @xmath5 term , which implies two stop mass eigenstates below 1 tev with a mass splitting in the order of a few hundreds gev .",
    "such a region is dubbed the `` golden region '' of mssm by perelstein and spethmann in ref .",
    "@xcite because it satisfies the experimental constraints , including the bound of 114 gev on the higgs mass , and minimizes the unnaturalness in the mssm .",
    "obviously implications of the mssm golden region on the possible collider signatures at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) deserve detailed studies if one wish to take the naturalness argument seriously .",
    "previous works on the phenomenology of mssm golden region can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we wish to study the implication of discovering the lightest cp - even higgs in the mssm golden region .",
    "since the higgs sector of the mssm contains two higgs doublets , after electroweak symmetry breaking there are five scalar higgs bosons remaining : a pair of charged higgs @xmath6 , one cp - odd higgs @xmath7 , two cp - even higgses @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath9 is defined to be the heavier one .",
    "moreover , it is found that , after including radiative corrections , there is an upper bound on the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs at roughly @xmath10 gev .",
    "( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "the importance of such a bound lies in the observation that a higgs boson in this mass range can be discovered at the lhc only through its decay into @xmath11 , which is a loop - induced process , because its mass is below the @xmath12 and @xmath13 thresholds ; decays into @xmath14 pair are swamped by the background . on the other hand ,",
    "the dominant production mechanism of the neutral higgs boson at the lhc is the gluon fusion process @xcite , also a loop induced process . since",
    "both production and decay channels are loop induced , and hence very sensitive to effects of new physics if any , the process @xmath15 is the natural playground to look for deviations from standard model predictions .    within mssm effects of supersymmetric particles in the production cross - section @xmath16 and the partial decay width @xmath17 have been studied previously @xcite .",
    "it is found that for both amplitudes the leading corrections come from the stop sector and , to a lesser extent , charged susy particles such as the charginos .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that , once the higgs is discovered in the process @xmath15 , two experimental measurements can be made at the same time : the event rate @xmath18 and the higgs mass @xmath0 .",
    "one should therefore make use of the information from both measurements in trying to extract parameters of the mssm .",
    "indeed , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that it is possible to obtain a fairly good estimate on the trilinear soft @xmath5 term in the stop sector , which is otherwise difficult to measure , if one combines knowledge on the production cross section in the gluon fusion channel @xmath16 and @xmath0 .",
    "one limitation of the proposal in @xcite is that the production cross section @xmath16 is not directly observable in collider experiments% @xcite , even though a recent study suggests a smaller uncertainty may be possible @xcite . ] ; only the product @xmath18 is .",
    "therefore , in this note we will study implications of combining two measurements , @xmath19 and @xmath0 , in @xmath15 with an emphasis on the golden region of the mssm parameter space .",
    "in this section we discuss the effects of superparticles on the higgs coupling to two gluons and two photons .",
    "in particular , we will work in the so - called decoupling limit @xcite where the pseudo - scalar higgs is much heavier than the @xmath21 boson : @xmath22 .",
    "there are two reasons for considering the decoupling limit .",
    "the first is the lightest cp - even higgs quickly reaches its maximal possible mass , which is phenomenologically desirable given the null result for higgs searches at both lep and tevatron .",
    "the second reason is the tree - level couplings of @xmath8 in the mssm to standard model fermions and gauge bosons approach the values for a standard model higgs , and the two become almost indistinguishable .",
    "therefore any deviations in the event rate from the standard model would come from effects of superparticles running in the loop .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in this case all other higgs bosons in the mssm are roughly degenerate @xmath23 . in practice",
    ", the decoupling limit is quickly reached for moderately large @xmath24 whenever @xmath3 gets larger than the maximal possible value for @xmath8 : @xmath25 . for small @xmath26 the decoupling limit",
    "is reached when @xmath27 gev .",
    "however , we will see later that higgs couplings to vector bosons approach the decoupling limit much faster than higgs couplings to fermions , which has important implications in the present study .",
    "analytic expressions for a cp - even scalar higgs decaying into two gluons and two photons within the standard model were obtained long ago in refs .",
    "the loop induced amplitude @xmath28 is mediated by the top quark , which has the largest coupling to the higgs among the fermions , whereas @xmath29 has the leading contribution from the @xmath30 boson loop with the top quark as the subleading contribution . in the mssm expressions for effects of superpartners",

    "the mixing parameter @xmath44 is the off - diagonal entry in the stop mass matrix @xmath45 where @xmath46    in the limit of heavy loops masses @xmath47 , the form factors approach the asymptotic values @xmath48 note that standard model contributions due to the top quark and @xmath30 boson loops are finite in the asymptotic limit , whereas the supersymmetric contributions are suppressed by large loop masses .",
    "one exception is the stop contribution in the mssm golden region when the stops are light and the mixing parameter @xmath44 is large . in this case",
    "the stop mixing angle is maximal , @xmath49 , and the @xmath39 coupling is strongly enhanced .",
    "thus the stop correction in the higgs production and decay amplitudes is the dominant one and very pronounced , despite being a loop effect .",
    "the particle giving the second largest effect is the chargino , not only because its effect decouples like @xmath50 when others decouple like @xmath51 , as can be seen in @xmath37 , but also because of the larger asympotic value of @xmath52 than @xmath53 .    for the gluon fusion production",
    ", it has been shown that the stop could have an order unity effect when comparing with the standard model rate , especially in the region of light stops and large mixing @xmath44 @xcite , which is exactly the mssm golden region .",
    "as for the higgs decay into two photons , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the stop could have a sizable effect , in the order of 10% level , in the mssm golden region .",
    "the effect is less dramatic than in the gluon fusion rate because the @xmath30 boson loop is the dominant contribution in the decay into two photons , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ asymp ] ) , which shows @xmath54 has the largest asymptotic value . moreover , among all the charged superparticles only the chargino loop could have a significant effect again in the order of 10% when the chargino is as light as 100 gev . for chargino masses above 250 gev , the deviation is less than 8% through out the entire mssm parameter space @xcite .",
    "the direct search limit of charginos from lep is at 103 gev , which is quite robust and independent of model assumptions , whereas searches at tevatron result in a lower bound of 145 gev in a specific model choice @xcite . in section",
    "iv we will demonstrate that throughout the mssm golden region the chargino has a small effect , when considering the ratio of the event rate @xmath18 in the mssm over the sm , once its mass is heavier than 200 gev .",
    "in addition to focusing on the region of mssm parameter space where the stops are light and the mixing is large , we would follow ref .",
    "@xcite and concentrate on the following choice of parameters :    * @xmath55 , * @xmath56 ,    the main reason for doing so is to avoid the region where the sbottom contribution could be significant in the loop induced processes @xcite as well as the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs is insensitive to @xmath26 once @xmath57 .",
    "since the bottom quark mass is very small @xmath58 gev , the above choice covers a very substantial region of mssm parameter space .",
    "another important comment is related to the observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the gluon fusion production rate depends on only two out of the three parameters in the stop mass matrix in eq .",

    "this translates into @xmath73 gev and @xmath74 gev .",
    "it turns out that , as pointed out in ref  .@xcite , the higgs mass @xmath0 is also sensitive to the same two parameters in the stop mass matrix .",
    "thus in the end two measurements in @xmath0 and @xmath75 could potentially yield useful information on two mass parameters , including @xmath44 , in the stop sector of the mssm .",
    "in this section we very briefly discuss the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs in the mssm , as much of it has been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm contains two higgs doublets , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which couples to the up - type and down - type quarks separately due to constraints from the anomaly cancellation and the holomorphicity of the superpotential .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking five remaining physical states are two cp - even neutral higgs bosons , @xmath8 ( the lighter one ) and @xmath9 ( the heavier one ) , one cp - odd neutral higgs boson @xmath7 , and the charged higgses @xmath6 . in the mssm",
    "there are two free parameters in the higgs sector , taken to be @xmath26 and @xmath3 , and at tree level one can derive an upper bound on @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath78 which is well below the direct search limit of 114 gev at lep .",
    "therefore , large radiative corrections from superparticles with significant couplings to @xmath8 are required to raise @xmath0 above the lep bound . among the new particles in mssm the stops have the largest coupling to the lightest cp - even higgs due to the top yukawa couplings .",
    "( we are avoiding the region of very large @xmath79 and large @xmath4 where the sbottom couplings could also be significant , as mentioned in the previous section . )",
    "if we assume for simplicity @xmath80 , the one - loop correction to @xmath0 is approximately given as @xcite @xmath81 which grows only logarithmically with the stop mass @xmath82 .",
    "therefore to lift @xmath0 from @xmath83 to be above 114 gev requires very heavy stops if there is no large mixing .",
    "typically for @xmath84 the stop masses need to be very large , @xmath85(1 tev ) , to evade the lep bound .",
    "on the other hand , the up - type higgs mass - squared increases quadratically with @xmath82 , @xmath86 thus heavy stop masses at around 1 tev would lead to large ( @xmath87 ) fine - tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the fine - tuning can be reduced if the stop masses could be significantly below 1 tev while at the same time keeping @xmath88 gev .",
    "this is possible only if there is large mixing in the stop sector , in which case the fine tuning can be reduced to the level of 5% .",

    "it is perhaps worth emphasizing that feynhiggs employs various approximation schemes in computing the mssm higgs production and decay rates , which are extrapolated from the sm predictions . in this work we use the program mainly to study the dependence on other susy parameters and",

    "higher - order qcd corrections could be important and should be included if a full - fledged analysis were performed , which is beyond the scope of the current work . in the following",

    "for example , let s choose @xmath101 gev and change @xmath100 from 200 to 1000 gev , which results a modification in @xmath91 from 200 to 900 gev .",

    "it has been previously observed that the chargino has a small effect in the partial width @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "here we see what is important is the value of the @xmath4 parameter , instead of the chargino mass itself .",
    "if @xmath4 is not too large , then the effect of the chargino is small not only in the partial width of @xmath29 , but also in the ratio of the event rate @xmath103 .",
    "on the other hand , we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that @xmath92 does have a strong dependence in the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter @xmath4 . from the discussion above we know this dependence can not come from the charginos .",

    "the bottom yukawa coupling controls the decay amplitude of @xmath104 , which partial width dominates the total decay width of the lightest cp - even higgs in mssm .",

    "such corrections become more important when @xmath26 becomes larger , which is the regime we are interested in . however , since we are avoiding regions where the sbottoms are light , we find the sbottom - gaugino loop is numerically unimportant . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we single out the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath92 for @xmath94 and some choices of stop masses and @xmath44 .",
    "the reason that the variation is asymmetric in @xmath113 is because the contribution from stop - chargino loop is linear in @xmath44 at leading order .",
    "so for one sign it adds to the tree - level result while for the opposite sign it subtracts .",
    "nevertheless , the important observation is that as the mixing parameter @xmath44 becomes larger , the variation becomes smaller . in this case ,",
