    "the planetary nebula ( pn ) phase occurs late in the evolution of low - mass stars when uv radiation from the star produces a photoionization - recombination balance in an expanding gaseous shell which had been expelled during the asympototic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "supersonic expansion velocities of 30 - 40 kms@xmath7 are seen in many planetary nebulae ( pne ) shells , in which the sound velocity is @xmath8kms@xmath7 . to explain why the pne do not follow a free thermal expansion ( sound velocity ) ,",
    "@xcite proposed the interacting stellar wind ( isw ) model , whereby a denser and slower agb wind interacts with a new fainter and faster stellar wind .",
    "the existence of a fast wind around the central star of pn was confirmed years later by means of uv observations with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) satellite ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "improvements in optical imaging have revealed that an understanding of the morphology of pne requires more complex explanations and depends on additional physical processes .",
    "@xcite proposed a modification to the isw model , the generalized interacting stellar wind ( gisw ) model , which includes an equatorial density enhancement to explain elliptical and bipolar morphologies .",
    "this model was subsequently confirmed as an appropriate approximation and further developed by @xcite and @xcite . since then",
    ", many other morphological features have been discovered in deeper and better resolved observations : open bipolar lobes ( called  diabolos  ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , multipolar structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rings ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and microstructures ( also called low ionization structures or lis ) such as ansae , knots , jets and filaments @xcite . in some cases , point - symmetry appears as an additional ingredient to the general morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as pne have different observed morphological features , many pne can not clearly be assigned membership to a morphological class based on a single defining feature ( round , bipolar , or elliptical ) .",
    "bipolarity has been explained since the pioneering work of @xcite as a consequence of an equatorial density enhancement of material formed by a mass - loaded ` superwind ' ejected in the late - agb phase .",
    "however , it is still poorly understood how this superwind is triggered and why it diverges from a spherical ejection .",
    "considering these open questions , @xcite reviews the possible shaping agents , remarking that binarity ( whose definition is expanded to include ` normal ' stars , brown dwarfs , and even planetary systems , as companions ) is a necessary ingredient to explain non - spherical shapes and possibly plays a fundamental role for spherical ones .",
    "in particular , @xcite considers common - envelope binary interactions as an original shaping agent in the formation of bipolar pne , taking up the work of @xcite .",
    "observations to probe binarity in central stars of pne are non - trivial , but have been successful in a number of cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recently with different techniques @xcite . a large fraction of pne have a central star which is actually a close binary system .",
    "@xcite note the fraction of close binary systems is @xmath9 , although there is evidence this number could be higher @xcite .",
    "currently , the number of close binary systems acting as central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) with orbital periods less than one day is @xmath1040 @xcite .",
    "scenarios other than a close binary system have also been explored .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate it is possible to get an equatorial density enhancement in the superwind when stellar rotation and/or magnetic fields are included in the model @xcite .",
    "however , other studies have found that stellar differential rotation can be drained by the magnetic field itself @xcite , reducing the field lifetime to @xmath11yr , too short to influence the geometry of the gaseous ejecta . more work is needed to determine the extent to which stellar rotation and magnetic fields are important in the formation of single - star axisymmetrical pne .    to investigate the origin of pne morphology and to characterize the important physical processes at work , theoretical models need to be supported with more high quality observational data .",
    "morphokinematic studies are a fundamental technique available to approach the problem @xcite , in which high resolution images and spectra are used to determine the real 3-d form of the complex gaseous structures . in this work",
    "we contribute to the study of pne by modeling the morphokinematic structure of , an object whose highly detailed images have been published in the hubble heritage project website .",

    "@xcite obtained infrared images of , in which the central region was clearly seen .",
    "this region was more intense in the south , which was suggested to be related to shock excitation .",
    "@xcite obtained narrow band h@xmath0 , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] images from which some ratios were performed .",
    "in spite of the the low resolution of such images , the values of the ratios along the minor axis were plotted in diagnostic diagrams to investigate the nature of the emission .",
    "they did not directly observe clumps , but were able to deduce a clumpy medium formed by knots and filaments based on variations in electron density in the [ ] images .",
    "they also proposed a possible shock excitation for the southern region along the minor axis seen in @xmath19 by @xcite , estimating planar shocks with velocities of @xmath20kms@xmath7 .",
    "better resolution h@xmath0 and [ ] images from @xcite partially show the complex internal structure proposed by @xcite . a recent study in the _ spitzer _ mid - infrared ( mir ) bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8@xmath21 m ) by @xcite shows gradients in the emission ratios .",
    "the observed gradients indicate an increasing importance of emission from photodissociation regions over emission from photoionization .",
    "other contributions to the observed mir emission include emission from polycyclic armatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and effects of shocked regions .    finally , the study of is of particular interest because it has been the topic of a series of articles in which its membership to a stellar open cluster is debated .",

    "a series of hubble space telescope ( hst ) narrow band images , taken with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc-2 ) , were retrieved from the mast archive to study the apparent morphology of ( proposal i d : 6119 ; pi : h. e. bond ; date of observation : 1995 august 26 ) .",

    "it has better accuracy than only taking the maximum of a broad unique emission line , as can be seen in low - resolution spectra . observing without enough spectral resolution to see the splitting can result in a wrong estimate for the systemic velocity if , as in this case , the components of the splitting have different brightness . without high resolution spectroscopy ,",
    "the non - resolved splitting is seen as a broad emission line with its maximum being biased towards the wavelength of the brightest component .",

    "in this paper , we present the first systemic velocity determination from the splitting method , utilizing high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "as described above ( sec .  [ imaging ] ) , our inspection of the unprecedented high resolution hst images indicates that is a morphologically rich pn with minor bubbles , asymmetrical outflows , and cometary knots inside its main structure ( figs .",

    "physical parameters , such as density and velocity , can be assigned to the points either as an analytical function or interactively .",
    "several recent papers have used shape to get the structure of pne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our particular case",
    ", we obtained a final nebula model which fits the main structure of for both imaging and spectroscopy ( fig .",
    "[ shape ] ) .",
    "we find can be modeled as a bipolar structure with major and minor axis length of @xmath43pc ( @xmath44arcsec at a distance of 2.5kpc , following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with an inclination angle of the major axis equal to 60 with respect to the line of sight ( eastern lobe is blueshifted , western lobe is redshifted ) .",
    "the polar and equatorial velocities are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , assuming homologous velocity expansion ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the shell has a maximum thickness of 0.1pc ( @xmath46arcsec ) becoming thinner towards the poles . using these velocities and dimensions ,",
    "we have estimated a kinematical age of @xmath5yr , which is similar to the age of other pne with cometary knots in their morphology ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the relatively high uncertainty in the kinematical age estimate merits a more detailed explanation .",
    "distance estimates for pne remain an important issue , given the very few cases in which we can get a ` direct ' measurement ( e.g. via stellar parallax ) .",
    "we have avoided distance estimates for ngc2818 based on membership of this object to the stellar cluster mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro2 ] , and instead have used statistical values .",
    "there are some estimates for the distance to this object ranging from 1.79kpc @xcite to 3.05kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite give a value of 2.5kpc , which is very close to mean value of the distance range .",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath1040% is obtained utilizing the statistical estimates ( which covers all the range of distance estimates ) .",
    "thus , the propagation of this high uncertainty has effects in the same proportion over the physical size ( @xmath47pc in the major axis ) and the kinematical age ( @xmath48yr ) .",
    "having better distance estimates will improve the accuracy on these two parameters , and is the focus of future work .",
    "because of their faintness , kinematics from the microstructures can not be determined as they are not seen in our spectra , with the exception of the ` big tail ' mentioned in sec .",
    "[ imaging ] . a careful analysis of images in figs .",
    "[ mosaico ] , [ cocientes ] , and [ zoom ] , as well as the pv map in fig .  [ pvs ] ( panel 2 , lower ) indicates that the ` big tail ' , as well as the other similar structures , have the same nature as the rest of the smaller cometary knots , being possibly photoevaporated , blown , and ionized by the action of the wind and radiation from the central star over the dense clumps that remain in its surroundings . in the ` big tail '",
    "a collimated ejection is unlikely as the two nw pieces do not share the same kinematic behavior , as would be expected in the case of a collimated ejection ( see fig .",
    "[ pvs ] , panel 2 , lower ) .",
    "if the ` big tail ' is not taken into account , it is remarkable to note that the small cometary knots have no apparent preferred direction , whereas the denser and larger features are related to the central region .",
    "the latter seems to be similar to the case of the helix nebula @xcite , which has been proposed to have a knotty torus whose axis is seen at @xmath49 with respect to the line of sight .    finally , the cometary knot antipodes in the upper - left side of the central region of appear to point towards a kind of ` local ' bubble center instead of the central star .",
    "one possible interpretation is that the peculiar kinematics of several bubbles inside the nebula play an important role in the production of tails .",
    "we think that this idea deserves more attention in theoretical studies and is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in this section we consider the line ratio images and what these ratios can tell us about the evolution of .",
    "first , we examine the image ratio [ ] /h@xmath0 .",
    "this ratio is sensitive to the variation of ionization / excitation and chemical abundances ( see * ? ? ? * ) and can also be used to look for signatures of collimated outflows @xcite . according to @xcite , pne with [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios enhanced in an outer layer ( or `` skin '' ) , are related to both , fast collimated outflows and multiple - shells , the latter may even have fliers ( fast low - ionization emission regions ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ cocientes ] ( upper - right panel ) , has a [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio diminished ( medina s type c ) , which could correspond to either young or evolved pne , but not related to jets , shocks , or multiple shells .",
    "it is important to note that no correction for extinction was applied . in particular ,",
    "this ratio image could be more affected by interstellar extinction ( or internal extinction , including internal small - scale variatons ) than the other ratios , given the relative large difference between the wavelengths of [ ] and h@xmath0 .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0 image ratio ( fig .",
    "[ cocientes ] , lower - left panel ) is sensitive to the shocked regions and is enhanced in the most noticeable tails seen in [ ] .",
    "these could indicate either that these tails are shocked gas or that gas in the tails is being shocked by the stellar wind . following the homologous velocity assumption ,",
    "we expect no more than 28 kms@xmath7 in stellar wind velocity at the distances in which the cometary knots are found , as they are preferentially located at a radius of 20arcsec around the central star ( 0.24 pc , assuming a distance of 2.5kpc )",
    ". however , these low velocity shocks could be enough to give rise to the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio in a detectable way ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the same ratio also appears to exist in the ring zone .",
    "this could be in agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite who detect emission possibly related to shocked gas .",
    "it is also remarkable that based on the imaging in their study , @xcite propose velocities of 110kms@xmath7 for the farthest regions of the nebula .",
    "based on kinematics , we also estimate polar velocities around this value .",
    "the /h@xmath0 image ratio shows the very high ionization regions .",
    "as expected , the highest ionized regions in are enclosed inside the main structure of the nebula in the regions surrounding the central star .",
    "this can also be seen in the the [ ] and images . in previous sections we defined the ` central region ' based on the emission , whose appearance reminds one of the remnant of an equatorial structure .",
    "a possible interpretation of the data could be that is a bipolar pn whose equatorial density enhancement can be traced by the cusps aligned with the central star and the brightness of the central region .",
    "the distorted internal structure and the presence of multiple bubbles and non - uniform microstructures can be seen as part of a pre - existent clumpy medium in the surroundings .",
    "although a definite model for the formation of cometary knots has not been generally accepted , hydrodynamical instabilities appear to adequately explain them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such instabilities could be formed in the beginning of the proto - pn phase and appear as cometary knots once the bipolar outflow is free .",
    "trying to understand the energetics involved in the whole process of formation and evolution of this nebula is an interesting way to address the study of the synergy between macro- and microstructures in the morphology of pne .",
    "we have conducted an observational study of using archival high resolution space - based imaging and high dispersion earth - based longslit spectroscopy .",
    "we derive a systemic velocity of @xmath6 .",
    "the computational software shape was used to construct a model to fit our data and improve our interpretation of the overall morphokinematic structure of .",
    "our model is consistent with a bipolar nebula with a semi - major axis of 0.92pc , possibly deformed by the stellar wind , a 0.17pc diameter central region that is a potential remnant of an equatorial enhancement , and a great number of cometary knots preferentially located inside a radius of 0.24pc around the central star .",
    "the major axis of the main structure is oriented at @xmath1 with respect to the line - of - sight and at @xmath2 on the plane of the sky .",
    "deprojected velocities correspond to an expansion of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which lead to an estimate of the kinematical age of @xmath50yr .",
    "cometary knots could be related to hydrodynamical instabilities formed before the bipolar outflow started .",
