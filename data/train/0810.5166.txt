    "it has been shown [ 1 ] that we can obtain a @xmath0 global charge ( leptonic ) at the end of inflation and that these charge it is associated with the complex scalar waterfall field that ends the inflation . but this leptonic charge must be transferred to the leptons of the standard model .",
    "we propose that this it is done via the disintegration of the watefall field into the right handed - neutrino ( right - handed projection of a four component spinor ) , and later the right - handed neutrino disintegrates into the leptonic doublet and the higgs doublet of the standard model .",
    "the lagrangian that describes these processes is    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the complex waterfall field , @xmath3 is the right - handed neutrino , @xmath4 is the higgs field and @xmath5 is the left - handed leptonic doublet [ 2],[3],[4],[5 ] . + but we must analyze in what environment this asymmetry is transferred .",
    "when the inflation is finished we have an initial leptonic charge associated with the waterfall field .",
    "almost instantaneously the scalar fields goes toward the minimum of the potential and then begin to oscillate around it . at these stage , there is a particle production of the inflaton field , the waterfall field and other fields that interact with them .",
    "if we suppose that the inflaton particles decay into ultrarelativistic fermions with a width or rate of decay much bigger than the widths or rates of decay for the processes of the inflaton with the waterfall field that could suppress the initial leptonic charge , and at the same time this width or rate of decay of the inflaton into a ultrarelativistic fermion is greater than the width or rate of decay of the waterfall field in the right - handed neutrino , then the universe can be thermalized before that the watefall field decay , leaving a radiation dominated energy density ( the inflaton is the dominant energy density at the end of the inflation and it is converted in a ultrarelativistic degree of freedom ) where the transference of the leptonic charge can be achieved .",
    "+ we study the boltzmann equations that describe first the transference of the leptonic charge from the initial leptonic charge contained in the waterfall field to the right - handed neutrino , then the transference of the leptonic charge of the right - handed neutrino to the lepton doublet of the standard model .",
    "we use only one family of doublets and one right - handed neutrino , but this model can be easily generalized to the three families and three right - handed neutrinos . here",
    "we must to point out the differences with the standard leptogenesis model [ 2],[3],[4],[5 ] . in the standard model of leptogenesis , the lepton asymmetry is obtained trough the decay of right - handed neutrino into the leptonic doublet and higgs , and the decay of the right - handed neutrino in the lepton antiparticle and higgs antiparticle ( two channels of disintegration for the right - handed neutrino ) .",
    "these processes violate leptonic number and c an cp symmetries and it is out of equilibrium . on the contrary , in our model these processes and the others",
    "processes involved in the transference , does nt violate c and cp symmetries , just there is a transference of the asymmetry from the waterfall field to the leptons of the standard model via the right - handed neutrino .",
    "this leptonic asymmetry can be converted to a baryonic asymmetry by sphaleron process .",
    "the asymmetry between baryon and antibaryon can be measured by the quantity @xmath6 where @xmath7 that it is the difference between the baryonic and antibaryonic density , and @xmath8 is the entropy density . the astronomical observation",
    "give us the numerical constraint [ 2 ] @xmath9",
    "the model is given by the potential [ 1 ]    @xmath10    where @xmath2 is the complex waterfall field , @xmath11 is the inflaton that it is a real field , g and @xmath12 are real constants and @xmath13 in general is complex . when @xmath14 we obtain the standard hybrid inflation .",

    "the critical points of the potential are : the first one is a local maximum , and is located at @xmath15 , and the corresponding value of the scalar potential is @xmath16 ( false vacuum ) .",

    "when the inflaton field acquires the value @xmath25 , the real component becomes unstable and tends toward it s true vacuum value , and at the same time inflation is finished .",
    "this asymmetric evolution of the components of the waterfall field give us a cp phase necessary to obtain a c and cp violation ( are equivalents in this case ) .",
    "the out of equilibrium is provided by the inflation itself that give us a direction in the arrow of time .",
    "these conditions are the condition to obtain a leptonic charge at the end of inflation .",
    "this leptonic charge is of the order of the baryonic charge observed today if the parameters of the model that satisfied the cmb density perturbations constraints takes values in the ranges given by : @xmath26 , @xmath27 that correspond to @xmath28 .",
    "after the inflation and during the oscillations of the classical scalar fields around the true vacuum , there is a production of particles of the inflaton and the waterfall fields and fields that interact with them .",
    "the parametric resonance production ( preheating ) is poor [ 6 ] .",
    "+ a detailed analysis of the evolution of the equation of state ( @xmath29 to @xmath30 ) involves a non equilibrium quantum field theory that is beyond the scope of this paper [ 7 ] .",

    "now , we can suppose that the inflaton field disintegrates into a ultrarelativistic degree of freedom with very small mass compared with the mass of the inflaton and with a life time short enough that can thermalize the universe before the waterfall field decay into the right - handed neutrino .",
    "to do so , we assume that dominant energy density is the energy density contained in the inflation field .",
    "but we must take into account that the interaction constant in the lagrangian of the interaction between the inflaton field and the ultrarelativistic fermionic particle is small enough to do not induce large loop corrections to the inflaton potential .",

    "the conditions @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be satisfied by the allowed parameter values , and the conditions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are satisfied once the condition @xmath55 is valid .",
    "then this analysis show to us that the inflaton decay into the ultrarelativistic fermion as a preferential channel before the waterfall field decay into the right - handed neutrino as it s preferential channel of decay .",
    "+ following the analysis of the reference [ 8 ] of the decay of the inflaton into ultrarelativistic particles that are the dominant in energy density , we can obtain a reheating temperature and a maximum temperature achieved during reheating .",
    "these are given by the formulas @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ,    where @xmath58 is the vacuum energy contained in the inflaton field in a hubble volume at the beginning of the oscillations .",
    "+ then at the end of the inflation and at the beginning of the oscillations the inflaton field particles begin to disintegrate into a ultrarelativistic fermion and when the time @xmath59 they decay rapidly . the processes due to interactions of the inflaton particles with the waterfall field particles are very suppressed and can be neglected as a first approximation .",

    "in the decay of the right handed neutrino , there is no cp violation , there is just a transference of leptonic number from the right handed neutrino to the leptons of the standard model of particles as we have said before .",
    "the mass term for the right - handed neutrino violates leptonic number and it acts like a suppression term in the transference of the leptonic charge as we will see a little later .    because cpt theorem we have @xmath70 for each decay . for each species we have the quantity @xmath71 that is the number of particles in a comovil volume .    for the waterfall field",
