    "long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to occur when a very massive star dies in a highly energetic supernova forming a black hole and producing a relativistic jet . because of the release of a large amount of isotropic equivalent energy ( @xmath3 erg ) release in the short prompt gamma - ray phase ( typically ranging from several seconds to several tens of seconds ) , the consideration of jet collimation of grbs is necessary to explain the radiation mechanism from compact sources ( e.g. , massive stars and/or mergers ) .",
    "this necessity is supported by achromatic temporal breaks ( also known as jet breaks ) in the afterglow light curves of the grbs .",
    "ultra - relativistic collimation and a jet structure are required to explain the light curve temporal breaks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , no direct observational evidence exists for this jet collimation .",
    "off - axis orphan grb afterglows are produced as a natural consequence of grb jet production @xcite .",
    "the production of these afterglows is as follows : grbs are collimated with rather narrow opening angles , and the afterglow that follows can be observed over a wider angular range . while the grb and the early afterglow are collimated to within the original jet opening angle , the afterglow in the late phase",
    "can still be observed by an off - axis observer after the jet break .",
    "the lorentz factor , @xmath4 , is a rapidly decreasing as function of time .",
    "this means that an observer at @xmath5 can not see the prompt gamma - ray emissions when @xmath6 but can detect an afterglow once @xmath7 equals @xmath5 . here , @xmath1 is the jet opening half angle . as the typical emission frequency and flux decrease with time",
    "( while the jet opening half angle @xmath1 increases with time ) , observers at larger viewing angles will detect fainter afterglows at longer wavelengths ( e.g. optical and radio ) .",
    "hence , the expected properties of grb orphan afterglows are as follows : ( 1 ) prompt emissions in the high - energy band are absent , ( 2 ) their brightness is fainter than that of on - axis grb optical afterglows , ( 3 ) they have the same optical color as on - axis afterglows , and ( 4 ) they show host galaxy properties similar to those of on - axis grbs .",
    "the afterglows are characterized by three - component light curves with rising , peaking , and rapidly decaying phases . in this case , events intermediate between classical hard grbs and off - axis orphan grb afterglows should exist .",
    "a candidate for the intermediate events is x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) as @xcite described in their off - axis jet model for explaining their nature .",
    "xrfs were recognized by the wide field cameras ( wfc , 2 - 28 kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the _ bepposax _ satellite @xcite .",
    "the observed x - ray temporal and spectral properties of xrfs in the prompt phase do not show any differences relative to those of grbs , except for the considerably lower energy values of the peak of the @xmath8 spectrum in the observer s frame .",
    "a large number of xrf samples were provided by _",
    "bepposax _ and high energy transient explorer 2 ( _ hete-2 _ ) , both of which employed wide field x - ray cameras @xmath9 the wfc onboard bepposax and the wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm , 2 - 25 kev * ? ? ? * ) onboard _ hete-2_. the majority of _ hete-2 _ samples ( nine out of 16 xrfs ) show a low energy of spectral peak energy @xmath10 kev @xcite . the number of xrfs detected by _",
    "hete-2 _ was comparable and relatively larger than that of grbs indicating that xrfs represent a large portion of the entire grb population @xcite .",
    "the observational properties of xrfs can be interpreted as being associated with the same phenomenon as classical hard grbs and as being representative of the extension of the grb population to low peak - energy events @xcite .",
    "to explain the aforementioned prompt observational properties , three models have been proposed for xrfs : a high redshift origin @xcite ; the off - axis jet model @xcite , which is equivalent to the unification scenario of agn galaxies ; and intrinsic properties ( e.g. , a subenergetic or inefficient fireball ) , which may also produce on - axis orphan afterglows @xcite .    the _ swift _ satellite has also been detecting many x - ray rich grbs ( xrrs ) and xrf samples @xcite .",
    "however , the xrf samples tend to be at the high - end of the @xmath11 distribution of _ bepposax _ and _ hete-2_. this is because of the relatively higher energy coverage of the burst alert telescope ( bat , 15 - 150 kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _",
    "swift_. although the monitoring of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) attached to the international space station has been detecting xrfs @xcite , there has been no appropriate follow - ups because of poor position determination .",
    "hence , xrf studies have stagnated because of the lack of soft - x - ray monitoring instruments and intensive multiwave length follow - up observations .    in this paper",
    ", we investigated the characteristics of xrfs on the basis of redshift measurements , multifrequency afterglow monitoring , and spectral peak measurements @xmath12 .",
    "the main objective was to verify the off - axis jet model and to provide feedback to ongoing and planned optical untargeted time - domain surveys by using subaru hyper - suprime - cam @xcite and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , which have considerable potential for detecting off - axis orphan grb afterglows .",
    "we considered possible xrfs for our study and quickly realized xrf 020903 was the only event that has ( 1 ) either a measurement or an upper bound on the peak energy of the prompt spectrum @xmath12 , ( 2 ) a measured redshift , and ( 3 ) multicolor afterglow observations adequately cover the early afterglow phase when achromatic brightening of the afterglow might occur .",
    "this was one of the xrfs detected by _",
    "hete-2 _ and",
    "the first events for which an optical afterglow was detected and a spectroscopic redshift ( @xmath13 ) was determined @xcite .",
    "the prompt emission had the lowest intrinsic spectral peak energy @xmath12 of @xmath14 kev among all the xrf samples . here , we employed the value estimated by the constrained band function with the 90% confident level @xcite . in accordance with the report of @xcite , the light curve in the prompt phase exhibited a double - peak structure and a lack of signals above 10 kev .",

    "* ) . for comparison with a large volume of data",
    ", we used @xmath11 instead of intrinsic spectral peak energies .",
    "the lowest intrinsic spectral peak energy determined from the relation @xmath12=(1+@xmath15)@xmath11 of xrf020903 stands out from all grb populations . the x - ray to the @xmath16-ray fluence ratio of 5.6 qualified this burst as an xrf .",
    "here , we used the xrf definition by @xcite for _ hete-2 _ events .",
    "effective follow - up observations in the optical band were made using wider - field - of - view ( fov ) instruments reported by @xcite and @xcite . because of a delay in the position alert and a large position error , the light curve sampling was sparse around the possible rebrightening epoch reported by @xcite . to describe the rebrightening epoch by using multicolor data , we added subaru archive data , as described in  3 .",
    "we collected data for the xrf  020903 afterglow by using subaru archive data and photometric results obtained from literature @xcite . to perform accurate optical photometry by removing contamination from the host galaxy , we also employed panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system 1 ( pan - starrs1 ) data .",
    "the individual data collections are summarized in the following subsections .      the entire _",

    "the first epoch of observation on 2002 september 3 ( 0.16 day after the burst ) involved an @xmath19-band filter .",
    "although the observation was performed under marginal airmass conditions ( from 2.55 to 2.75 ) , the wide - field imager with the 8-m - class telescope provided the deep @xmath19-band images with three sets of 180 s exposure .",
    "subsequently , three color observations were made on the night of 2002 september 4 by using @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22-band filters . during the night observation , two epochs of @xmath21 and @xmath23 bands imaging and three epochs of @xmath19-band monitoring",
    "were also conducted to check the short - term variability of the afterglow . the @xmath21 and @xmath23 band observations were made under the reasonable observing condition ( e.g. , in the airmass range from 1.34 to 1.97 ) .",
    "the second epoch of @xmath19-band imaging was also performed under the reasonable observing condition ( e.g. , for an airmass of 1.32 ) . by contrast , the first and third epochs of @xmath19-band observations were made under the marginal airmass conditions ( @xmath24 for the first epoch and @xmath25 for the third epoch ) .",
    "these observations were performed with using appropriate dithering techniques to fill up the chip gaps in the camera .    the subaru - xmm deep survey ( sxds ) team attempted to obtain deeper reference images with @xmath19-band filter on the night of october 9 and 10 .",

    "when we consider a simple direct connection to the first epoch of @xmath26 band photometry ( 0.660 days ) made by ctio , the @xmath52 band light curve is flat .",
    "the @xmath52- and @xmath53- band light curves show a clear rapid rebrightening between 0.7 and 0.9 days .",
    "the equivalent rising power law index @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) are @xmath56 in the @xmath52 and @xmath57 in the @xmath53 band .",
    "the multiepochs observations of the subaru on 2002 september 4 show a flatter and decaying light curve for all three bands .",
    "the @xmath52 band light curve shows continuous decay up to @xmath297 days .",
    "this indicates that the rebrightening peak was around 0.8@xmath290.9 days after the burst .",
    "as @xcite demonstrated , there is another late - phase rebrightening peaking at @xmath58 days in the @xmath26 band light curve , which was interpreted as the associated supernova component .",
    "the late phase @xmath19-band image taken by subaru on 2002 october 9 also detected this supernova component in the differential image , and this component is consistent with that observed in the @xmath26-band within the systematic error .",
    "the multiband observations of xrf 020903 were used to determine the spectral flux distribution ( sed ) at 0.7 and 0.9 day after the burst . to remove the effects of the galactic interstellar extinction , we used the reddening map of @xcite . because not all multiband observations were performed exactly at the same epoch , their corresponding fluxes were rescaled to assume a power - law function ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "in particular , the brightening phase around 0.7 day was substantially affected . to determine the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at 0.7 day",
    ", we fixed the time at the epoch of the @xmath28-band observation ( 0.695 days ) .",
    "because the @xmath52- and @xmath53-band observations were made earlier than @xmath28 band observations , and the brightening index for @xmath52 and @xmath53 were estimated as previously described (  4.2 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sed ] , we plot the sed obtained on the basis of the photometric results for @xmath60 bands provided by the ctio observations .",
    "the sed is well fitted by the power - law function as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the flux density at frequency @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the spectral index .",
    "we have obtained the @xmath64 at 0.695 day as @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , we generated the sed at 0.899 day on basis of the on @xmath19-,@xmath41- , and @xmath22-band results and obtained a @xmath64 value of @xmath66 , which is consistent with the value for 0.695 day .",
    "these results imply that the rebrightening is achromatic .",
    "on the basis of the results for xrf020903 described in the preceding section , we discuss the off - axis jet model in the following sections because this model provides a reasonable explanation for this particularly soft xrf .",
    "furthermore this model can explain both the extremely soft prompt emission features and achromatic light curve brightening altogether .      to perform light curves and seds modeling for xrf020903 ,",
    "we employed the boxfit code @xcite that involves two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical jet simulations for determining the burst explosion parameters , including the off - axis viewing angle and the synchrotron radiation parameters for a homogeneous circumburst medium .    in the modeling",
    ", we added 17% of the systematic errors to the @xmath26-band light curve because of the large transmission differences , as shown in figure [ fig : filter ] . to perform light curve modeling",
    ", we focused on the data between 0.6 and 8 day because the observed optical light curve showed achromatic brightening between 0.7 and 0.8 day after the burst , which is unusual among the well - observed afterglows .",
    "the later phase ( from @xmath2920 days ) was excluded in the modeling because it is likely to be the sn component @xcite .",
    "we also excluded the single data point at 0.16 day because the sparse monitoring and single detection at 0.16 day make it difficult to decode the light curve between 0.16 and 0.7 day .",
    "the consideration of different components ( one component faded away before 0.6 day and the other was rebrightening ) was reasonable because connecting the light curve between 0.16 and 0.7 day smoothly produced a flat evolution , indicating long lasting ( @xmath290.6 days ) energy injection . using multicolor optical data between 0.6 day and 8 days and the radio 8.5 ghz radio data , we performed light curve modeling .",
    "we examined the light curves for various values of @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "the range of @xmath1 covered most of the estimated values for classical grbs ( from 0.04 rad to 0.5 rad ) , while @xmath5 varied from 0.0 rad to 1.5 rad when an at least 3-fold enhancement of @xmath1 was examined .",

    "we consider the case of xrf  020903 . in the following , we fix @xmath120 rad and @xmath121 rad .",
    "subsequently , ratios @xmath115 and @xmath116 are calculated for given @xmath16 .",
    "for example , we find @xmath122 and @xmath123 if @xmath124 .",
    "classical hard grbs typically have @xmath125  kev @xcite , and therefore we first assume @xmath126  kev . we then find that @xmath127  kev , which is close to the observed result for xrf  020903 .",
    "furthermore , for the observed value of @xmath79 , we consider @xmath128erg , resulting in @xmath129erg . in summary , if a jet with @xmath121 and @xmath124 is seen on - axis ( @xmath130 ) , we would have @xmath125  kev and @xmath131erg , which is almost consistent with the @xmath132 relation @xcite .",
    "the empirical relation could be an indicator of grb category although the background physics are not yet fully understood .",
    "in fact , classical hard grbs show the relation , but short grbs do not exhibit it .",
    "hence , the observed small values of @xmath12 and @xmath79 for xrf  020903 are naturally explained by the off - axis jet model .",
    "we also discuss parameter dependence . in the following , we fix @xmath120 rad , @xmath121 rad , and @xmath133erg .",
    "the observed best fit value @xmath134  kev is reproduced for @xmath135 and @xmath126  kev , and we obtain @xmath136erg . for @xmath137  kev , we need a smaller @xmath16 value ( 79 ) is required to obtain @xmath134  kev , and we find @xmath138erg .",
    "similarly , when we consider @xmath139  mev , we have @xmath140 and @xmath141erg . for these cases ,",
    "the on - axis values , @xmath142 and @xmath143 remain within the 3@xmath144 scatter of the @xmath132 relation .",
    "these values of @xmath16 are consistent with those measured using the onset of optical afterglows .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath16 measurements that were distributed from @xmath145 to @xmath146 as well as a significant proportion of events that exhibited values below 200 .",
    "however , the values are lower than the prediction ( @xmath147 for all grbs ) made by @xcite for reducing the number of unseen events away from the observed @xmath148 and @xmath149 @xcite relations . here , @xmath150 is the jet collimation - corrected energy .",
    "the simplest off - axis jet models for xrfs @xcite adopt low values of @xmath16 ( @xmath151 ) and predict a large number of events away from these relations that are not observed ( see figures 4 - 9 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore something more complicated procedures must be required . for one of examples , @xcite described that a inverse correlation between @xmath16 and the opening solid angle of the grb jet has the effect of greatly reducing the visibility of off - axis events.another possibility is to consider more complicated jet structure ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the spectral peak energy of xrf020903 is conservatively determined only the upper limit , reported by @xcite .",
    "although xrf020903 also followed the @xmath152 relation when we employed the value estimated by the constrained band function with the 90% confident level , four of the five _ hete-2 _ xrfs ( including xrf 020903 ) with the lowest upper limits on @xmath11 were potential outlier events of the @xmath152 and the @xmath153 relations . because these events are outliers in the @xmath154 ( figure 1 in @xcite and figure 9 in @xcite ) and the @xmath155 planes ( figure 2 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here , @xmath156 and @xmath157 denote the peak photon number flux of the burst and the energy fluence , respectively .",
    "these results indicate that the nature of these four xrfs @xmath78 and therefore the nature of xrfs in general @xmath78 might differ considerably from those of the rest of the xrfs , xrrs , and grbs .",
    "however , our result on one of the four outlier events contradicts this suggestion .",
    "hence , we may be able to explain the remaining three lowest @xmath11 events in an identical manner , although additional adjustments on the jet geometry or the initial lorentz factor could be required .",
    "finding off - axis orphan afterglows through untargeted optical surveys is also a crucial method for establishing a unified picture of grbs .",
    "several optical time - domain surveys performed using telescopes with diameters in the range of 1 - 2 m ( e.g. iptf , pan - starrs1 ) have reported intriguing new discoveries related to stellar explosions .",
    "however , the sensitivities of these surveys were insufficient for detecting faint off - axis orphan afterglows . hence , off - axis orphan grb afterglows are yet to be observationally confirmed .",
    "however , a new wide - field - of - view camera @xmath9hyper - suprime - cam ( hsc)@xmath9 attached to the subaru telescope and the planned lsst have considerable capabilities to detect the first off - axis orphan grb afterglow in untargeted time - domain surveys",
    ".    one of the challenges in generic transient surveys is determining candidates from the various types of optical transients , because the occurrence of grb orphan afterglows is rarer compared with that of known types of supernova .",
    "these candidate selection can be performed using optical photometric survey data and a proper photometric transient classification .",
    "the photometric classification involves seven steps : ( 1 ) finding transient candidates by generating differential images , ( 2 ) generating light curves for transient components , ( 3 ) identifying host galaxies , ( 4 ) determining a transient location in their hosts , ( 5 ) matching the candidates with known sources in various catalogs , ( 6 ) matching light curves and color evolution , and ( 7 ) estimating the photometric redshift of hosts . for step ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we can employ the algorithm @xcite as described in  4 and @xcite . for step ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 7 )",
    ", a considerable number of grb host galaxy observations have been performed in the optical and near - infrared range .",
    "systematic unbiased observations have also been performed using vlt @xcite .",
    "the brightness range of host galaxies for grbs for @xmath158 is 23.0@xmath926.5 mag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the redshift range of a considerable number of orphan grb afterglows with hsc surveys extends up to @xmath159 , hsc images ( e.g. reference images for psf matched subtraction ) are sufficiently deep to detect these host galaxies .",
    "thus , we can also perform the photometric redshift for the host galaxies .",
    "photometric redshift for grb host galaxies is also effective ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the light curve expectations basis of off - axis jet origin of xrfs are crucial to establish a effective candidate searches .",
    "figure [ fig : orphan ] shows the expected off - axis afterglow light curves at @xmath160 along with various observing angles ( @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 ) in the optical @xmath164-band , alma band3 , and jvla 8.5 ghz , obtained from the light curve modeling of xrf020903 .",
    "the orange dashed lines in figure [ fig : orphan ] indicate the sensitivity limit for 1 h exposure for each instrument .",
    "hence , off - axis orphan grb afterglows ( up to @xmath165 ) can be detected in optical time - domain surveys by using 8 m class telescopes .",
    "follow - up radio observations are also crucial for confirmation of orphan afterglows and identification of constraints on their physical parameters , as shown in figure [ fig : orphan ] . because radio temporal evolution is substantially slower than that of optical temporal evolution , long - term monitoring by using alma and/or jvla with reasonable exposure ( @xmath291h ) requires the confirmation of the optical candidates .",
    "we studied xrfs on the basis of redshift measurements , multifrequency afterglow modeling , and spectral peak measurements ( @xmath12 ) to verify the off - axis jet model and to provide feedback to ongoing and planned optical time - domain surveys , which have considerable potential for detecting off - axis orphan grb afterglows .",
    "because off - axis orphan grb afterglows are produced as a natural consequence of grb jets production , the confirmation of the off - axis origin of xrfs is the necessary to conduct off - axis orphan grb afterglow surveys .    to verify the off - axis jet model",
    ", we selected xrf020903 by considering the three aforementioned sample selection factors .",
    "for this event , we reduced the archived data of subaru to describe the optical light curves , and found achromatic rebrightening at @xmath290.7 days . using these optical results and radio data obtained from literature , we performed afterglow light curve modeling with the boxfit code and found that the off - axis jet model ( @xmath69 ) could explain the achromatic rebrightening , @xmath67-band temporal evolution , and radio brightness .",
    "we also compared the burst parameters of xrf020903 with those of other categories of events , such as a classical hard grb , an xrr , and an on - axis orphan grb candidate . for xrf080330",
    ", we performed light curve modeling in a manner similar to that used for xrf020903 by using optical data from literature , and we confirmed that the off - axis jet model ( @xmath71 ) could describe the optical afterglow light curves .",
    "we also listed the observed features of the prompt emission for each event .",
    "the observed values were too widely distributed to represent the classical hard grb , xrr , and xrf . by contrast , the parameters obtained from the afterglow modeling were comparable to each other , except for @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the off - axis jet model was found to be suitable for explaining the diverse afterglow light curves and the grb category .",
    "we also verified the observed small values of @xmath12 and @xmath79 by adopting a simple model with a top - hat profile of the prompt emission of a relativistic jet .",
    "the parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 were analytically derived as functions of @xmath5 , @xmath1 , and @xmath114 . by fixing @xmath5 and @xmath1 as 0.21 and 0.1 rad , respectively",
    ", we evaluated @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and @xmath79 observed from the on - axis of the jet ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "these expected values were consistent with those of classical hard grbs , and the observed small values of @xmath12 and @xmath79 of xrf  020903 could be naturally explained by the off - axis jet model .    finally , we expected off - axis orphan grb afterglow light curves at @xmath160 along with three viewing angles on the basis of the xrf afterglow light curve modeling . to detect these light curves ,",
    "especially afterglows with a larger viewing angle ( @xmath166 ) , an 8-m class telescope with wide - field imagers , such as the lsst and subaru / hsc , is required .",
    "off - axis orphan grb afterglows up to @xmath165 can be discovered by performing time - domain surveys with an 8-m class telescope . because such optical time - domain surveys also detect numerous other optical transients , we presented expected radio afterglow light curves for the confirmation and determination of burst parameters .",
    "radio light curves can be monitored using alma and jvla with reasonable exposure .    this work is partly supported by the ministry of science and technology of taiwan grants nsc 100 - 2112-m-008 - 007-my3 and most 103 - 2112-m-008 - 021-(yu ) .",
