    "the interaction of charged particles with background electromagnetic fields has been intensively studied since the seminal works by heisenberg and euler , and weisskopf on the effective action in a constant electromagnetic field in spinor qed @xcite and scalar qed @xcite .",
    "proper - time formalism has laid a corner stone for probing vacuum polarization in the constant electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the quantum states of a charged particle are an essential ingredient in understanding the strong electromagnetic interaction and the vacuum polarization , in particular , in strongly magnetized neutron stars @xcite and in extremely high - intensity lasers @xcite .    in a constant magnetic field",
    "charged spin-1/2 fermions or spinless scalars have landau levels @xcite and the energy spectrum leads to the qed effective action via the zeta - function regularization @xcite .",
    "however , the quantum motion becomes non - trivial when the background electromagnetic field is localized in space or depends on time .",
    "recently the effective actions in spinor or scalar qed have been found for the sauter - type electric field localized in time or space , in which the quantum states of charged spin-1/2 fermion or spinless scalar are used in the in - out formalism @xcite , and the effective action has been found for the sauter - type magnetic field localized in space in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resolvent method has also been used to compute the effective action in the sauter - type electric field @xcite and the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the fermionic determinants have been investigated in static inhomogeneous magnetic fields @xcite . for numerical purposes ,",
    "the worldline formalism has also been applied to scalar qed in a static magnetic field of step function @xcite and the real space split operator has been introduced for scalar qed in arbitrary electromagnetic potential @xcite . hence analytical studies of quantum states of charged particles beyond the sauter - type electric or magnetic field or in time - dependent magnetic fields will be not only of theoretical interest but also of practical applicability .",
    "in this paper we study the quantum states of charged spinless scalars in homogeneous , time - dependent magnetic fields . for that purpose",
    "we observe that the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation in a time - dependent magnetic field and the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation for the friedman - robertson - walker universe with a minimal massive scalar field have the same mathematical structure : a relativistic wave equation with a transverse motion of time - dependent harmonic oscillator .",
    "the cauchy initial value problem for the wdw equation with a general scalar field has been studied in the two - component first order formalism @xcite and in the third quantization @xcite .",

    "do not decouple the kg equation and undergo continuous transitions among themselves during the quantum evolution .",
    "we formulate the cauchy initial value problem , which expresses the kg equation as the two - component first order equation and incorporates the rate of change of landau levels in addition to the instantaneous energy spectrum .",
    "the ratio of the rate of change of each landau level to the corresponding dynamical phase during any time interval may provide a measure that characterizes and classifies the quantum motions of charged particles into ( i ) the adiabatic change , ( ii ) the sudden change , and ( iii ) the nonadiabatic change .    in the case of an adiabatic change of magnetic field the landau levels change so slowly that the charged scalar remains in the same time - dependent landau level and the adiabatic theorem holds , as expected by physical intuition .",
    "by contrast , in the case of a sudden change the landau levels change so rapidly that the charged scalar can not follow the time - dependent landau level and is thus frozen to the initial landau level .",
    "the magnetic field that suddenly changes as a step function provides an exactly solvable model , in which the dynamical phase is extremely small compared to a finite change of landau levels during the infinitesimal interval and thus the measure becomes arbitrary large .",
    "in the last case of a nonadibatic change the charged scalar makes continuously transitions among time - dependent landau levels , keeping the parity of the initial landau level .",

    "[ sec3 ] we further propose a dimensionless measure which depends on the relative ratio of the rate of change of landau levels to the dynamical phase over the time interval under study and which classifies the quantum motions into the adiabatic change , the sudden change , and the nonadiabatic change . in sec .",

    "as far as pair production is concerned , time - dependent magnetic fields strongly contrast constant magnetic fields , in which the dirac sea is stable at one loop and prohibits charged pairs from being emitted . though the direction of the magnetic field is fixed in this paper , it would be interesting to compare pair production from a rotating magnetic field in ref .",
    "we have studied the quantum evolution of charged scalars in a homogeneous , time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "in contrast to a constant magnetic field , the landau levels that instantaneously diagonalize the kg equation are a unitary transformation of initial ones via a one - mode squeeze operator when the magnetic field changes from a constant value .",
    "the two - component first order formalism has been employed to solve the cauchy initial problem ( [ cauchy ] ) in the basis of time - dependent landau levels .",
    "we have introduced a dimensionless measure ( [ r ] ) that classifies the quantum motions into three categories : ( i ) the adiabatic change , ( ii ) the sudden change , and ( iii ) the nonadiabatic change .",
    "the measure is the ratio of the rate of change of each landau level to the corresponding dynamical phase for the time interval under study .",
    "when the magnetic field changes so slowly that the ratio is very small , the time - dependent landau level adiabatically changes and the charged scalar remains in the same landau level , while when the magnetic field changes so rapidly that the ratio is very large , the charged scalar can not follow the rapidly changing landau level and is frozen to the initial landau level . on the other hand , when the ratio is order of unity and the rate of change of the landau level is comparable to the corresponding energy , the charged scalar makes continuous transitions among time - dependent landau levels , keeping the parity of the initial state , during the quantum evolution .",
    "we have explicitly analyzed the quantum states for the charged scalar when the magnetic field changes from one constant value to another as a step function .",
    "the two - component propagator ( [ cauchy ] ) and ( [ two prop ] ) during an infinitesimal interval for the change of the magnetic field reduces to the one - mode squeeze operator for the change of landau levels , and the resulting quantum state remains the same initial landau level .",
    "this implies that the scalar does not follow the instantaneously changing landau level and is frozen in the initial landau level .",
    "we have found the bogoliubov coefficients when the out - state is the frozen landau levels with the energy spectrum in the changed magnetic field .",
    "this implies that a time - dependent magnetic field may produce pairs of charged particles from the dirac sea , which is supported from the presence of an induced electric field .",
