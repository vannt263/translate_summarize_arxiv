    "as stellar galactic disks form and evolve , the processes governing their development leave behind a multitude of traces .",
    "massive stars pollute the interstellar medium through supernova explosions and stellar winds , endowing subsequent generations of stars with distinct chemical signatures .",
    "similarly , dynamical perturbations , whether they are secular ( spiral arms or bars ) or due to the hierchical build - up of mass , sculpt the kinematic properties of stellar populations .",
    "together , these signatures provide a `` fossil record '' of a disk s evolution through cosmic time .",
    "galaxy formation models attempt to match their predictions to this fossil record and attempt to reconstruct the disk s history . for the past thirty years",
    ", an implicit assumption has been made in such modeling : stars remain in the same part of the disk forever ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this simple assumption carries enormous power as it allows one to reconstruct the time evolution of a given quantity ( such as metallicity and star formation rate ) at a particular radius from present - day , single epoch observations .",
    "such `` static '' modeling has been successful in illuminating several critical aspects of disk formation such as the need for infall of low metallicity gas to solve the g - dwarf problem @xcite . over the past several years , however , this assumption of stars remaining near their birth radii has been firmly shaken by the realization that rapid stellar migrations of several kpc are possible ( * ? ? ? * sb02 hereafter ) .",
    "the idea that stars may not remain near their birth radii is not new .",
    "@xcite suggested that stellar orbits diffuse in velocity space consequently inducing a drift in the galactocentric radius for an ensemble of stars .",
    "this was followed up by @xcite and applied to the determination of the sun s birthplace @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the diffusion is a relatively slow process driven by random scattering by giant molecular clouds - for observationally - constrained velocity dispersions , variations in galactocentric radius of at most few kpc are expected . instead",
    ", in the mechanism described by sb02 , migrations of _ several _ kpc may take place in a few hundred myr due to very efficient exchange of angular momentum at the corotation resonance ( cr ) .",
    "this exchange of energy and angular momentum at the cr occurs without changing the orbital radial actions therefore retaining the orbital circularity .",
    "in addition , the mechanism operates most efficiently for stars on the most circular orbits .",
    "these two properties lead to the peculiar result that migrations of several kpc in a mw - size disk are possible without substantial accompanying increase in random motion .",
    "the increase in velocity dispersion with age of stars ( see e.g. @xcite for the solar neighborhood ) constrains heating processes and thereby also the magnitude of spiral perturbations , so the ability of the cr to redistribute stars substantially without heating excessively is a critical aspect of the cr mixing process . because the sb02 mechanism involves the cr",
    ", the spiral amplitudes must be transient if _ redistribution _ rather than _ trapping _ is to occur . in the absence of other perturbations ,",
    "a steady spiral traps stars on horseshoe orbits - however , if a spiral s amplitude grows and decays on a timescale comparable to one half the libration period of a horseshoe orbit , the spiral will merely deposit the star on the other side of the resonance and vanish before pulling it back ( sb02 ) .",
    "unlike steady spirals that can heat the disk only at the lindblad resonances @xcite , transient spirals can also heat the disk away from the principal resonances @xcite .",
    "consequently , a single spiral can heat the disk enough to prevent any further asymmetric structure formation in just a few rotations @xcite .",
    "star formation provides a natural cooling mechanism , continually peppering the disk with young stars born with the galactic velocities of their parent gas clouds .",
    "@xcite found that in the presence of such cooling , transient spirals keep the disk in a quasi - stable state at a toomre @xmath0 , which allows for their continual regeneration .",
    "the realization that stars in galactic disks may migrate radially across significant distances has in recent years completely changed the discourse on spiral galaxy evolution . following sb02 , several other theoretical works have further illuminated the complexities that radial mixing introduces for stellar population studies .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of corotation scattering on the disk metallicity gradient .",
    "* hereafter r08a ) showed that radial migration could drastically alter the stellar population properties of outer disks and provided an explanation for the observed gradients across the surface brightness profile break in ngc4244 @xcite .",
    "r08a predicted that disks with broken exponential profiles should show an inflection in the mean age profile corresponding to the break radius .",
    "this has subsequently been confirmed indirectly by surface photometry @xcite and directly by integral - field spectroscopy ( @xcite , yoachim et al .",
    "2012 , in press ) and resolved - star counts ( radburn - smith 2012 , submitted ) , providing further evidence that radial mixing occurs in external galaxies .",
    "using the same simulations , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter r08b ) extended the analysis of r08a and investigated the repercussions of stellar migration for a range of stellar population studies : the solar neighborhood age - metallicity relation ( amr ) and metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) , the evolution of metallicity gradients , and the reconstruction of star formation histories from present - day observations of stellar populations in external galaxies .",
    "they found that @xmath1 of stars on mostly circular orbits in the solar neighborhood of their model have come from elsewhere and that migration flattens the amr and broadens the mdf .",
    "they also found that the reconstruction of a star formation history becomes problematic in the presence of migration especially at large radii where the mass in migrated stars approaches or exceeds the cumulative amount of stars formed in - situ .",
    "r08ab therefore established the notion that regardless of the method used to observe a galactic disk ( unresolved photometry , photometry of resolved stars , spectroscopy of individual stars in the mw ) radially migrated stars substantially alter the combined properties of the observed sample , thereby possibly strongly biasing the outcome of any subsequent modelling .",
    "@xcite included a probabilistic prescription of radial migration in a chemical evolution model constrained by milky way observables and found that , similarly to r08b , the mdf is broadened and the amr flattened as a result of migration .",
    "they found also that most obervational properties and peculiarities of the thick disk can be explained by radial migration .",
    "@xcite explored the formation of the thick disk via radial migration in the @xmath2-body models of r08ab and similarly found that simulated trends tend to agree qualitatively with observed thick disk properties from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that apart from corotation scattering as presented by sb02 , combined effects of multiple nearby resonances from several different patterns may also be important in driving the redistribution of stars .",
    "their results implied that substantial mixing is possible even if the spiral structure is not transient . @xcite",
    "measured the diffusion coefficients in idealized bar - unstable disks and found the cr of the bar to be driving the diffusion , though their models were collisionless and as such did not allow for recurrent spiral activity .",
    "understanding radial migration is particularly relevant at the present time because of the upcoming surveys designed to study the detailed structure of the milky way disk .",
    "studies using data from the sdss ( e.g. @xcite ) and its follow - up surveys such as segue @xcite , as well as results using data from rave @xcite have already pushed the current models to their limits in trying to explain the various observed trends and interdependencies in the thick and thin disks . in the coming years , spectroscopic surveys , such as hermes @xcite and apogee @xcite , will obtain high - resolution spectroscopy of millions of stars , allowing finally for `` chemical tagging '' of stars into their birth clusters @xcite .",
    "such observations will in principle allow for a direct measurement of stellar radial migration in the milky way @xcite . at the same time , the _ gaia _ mission will provide a complete 6d map of a 10 kpc sphere centered on the sun @xcite , and follow - up spectroscopic surveys will yield vast amounts of complementary chemical abundance data .",
    "finally , the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite will similarly provide ground - based photometry of the entire sky . to distill these vast data sets and apply them to galactic archeology ,",
    "a clear understanding of the radial mixing processes is essential .    in this paper",
    ", we explore in detail the properties of self - propagating spiral structure and the causes of the resulting radial migration in simulations from r08ab and @xcite .",
    "we first quantify the spiral structure that forms spontaneously in our simulations and use this analysis as a basis for understanding the causes of radial migration .",
    "we also perform a set of numerical tests to explore the robustness of our results to choices of numerical parameters and stochasticity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in @xmath3  [ sec : sim ] we discuss the details of our models ; in @xmath3  [ sec : spiral_anatomy ] we quantify the spiral structure in our fiducial simulation ; in @xmath3  [ sec : angular_momentum_corotation ] we explore the causes of radial mixing ; in @xmath3  [ sec : numerical_tests ] we present several tests of the effects of numerical parameters on the generation of spiral structure ; finally , we state our conclusions in @xmath3  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the initial conditions for all of the runs presented here are generated as described in @xcite , and consist of spherical distributions of dark matter ( dm ) and gas following an nfw @xcite density profile .",
    "the random velocities of the dm particles are initialized to ensure equilibrium by means of the distribution function obtained from an inversion of the nfw density profile @xcite .",
    "the gas is initialized to the same mass distribution with a temperature profile to yield an approximate hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the gas is also given a spin consistent with values obtained from collisionless cosmological simulations @xcite , i.e. @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total angular momentum , @xmath6 is the total energy of the system and @xmath7 is the mass .",
    "the angular momentum follows a radial profile of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the specific angular momentum . in the fiducial run we use @xmath10 particles per component , resulting in dm particle mass of @xmath11 and initial gas mass of @xmath12 .",

    "we summarize the important features .",
    "a gas particle becomes eligible for star formation when its density exceeds @xmath13 and its temperature dips below 15,000  k. if eligible , the gas particle converts some of its mass into a star particle at a rate given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the star formation efficiency ( set to 0.05 in all of the simulations ) , @xmath16 is the gas density and @xmath17 is the local dynamical time .",
    "star particles form with 1/3 of the initial gas particle mass ( in the fiducial simulation this translates to star particle masses of @xmath18 ) and to avoid unreasonably small particle masses , gas particle masses are limited to 1/5 of their initial mass .",
    "when a particle crosses this threshold its mass is distributed among neighboring particles , resulting in an overall decrease of the number of gas particles with time .",
    "each star particle represents an entire stellar population and therefore a spectrum of stellar masses described by the miller - scalo initial mass function @xcite .",
    "the evolution of massive stars is followed and a feedback cycle is initiated to reflect the explosion of type ii supernovae . at typical particle masses of @xmath19 ,",
    "the supernova energy is injected into the ism `` in bulk '' , i.e. individual explosions are not modeled .",
    "the effect of the supernova explosions is modeled on the sub - grid level as a blastwave propagating through the ism .",
    "we track ism metal enrichment from type ii and type ia supernovae as well as from agb stars .",
    "the complete set of parameters used for the simulations discussed in this paper is listed in table  [ table : runs ] .",
    "our fiducial run , has been studied extensively and we used it previously for results presented in r08ab .",
    "the baryonic particles in the fiducial run use a softening length @xmath20  pc .",
    "we tested the softening dependence of our results with runs s1 , s3 and s4 ( @xmath21  and 500  pc respectively ) .",
    "we also tested the effect of varying particle numbers in runs r1 , r3 and r4 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 particles in each component respectively .",
    "we ran a further test of the effects of the mass resolution of the dm halo by running a simulation with 10 times the number of dm particles ( run sdm ) .",
    "all runs were carried out for 10 gyr .",
    "the opening angle @xmath25 used for simplifying gravity calculations was 0.7 for all runs .",
    "the code uses a multistepping scheme with the condition that a particle s timestep @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the gravitational softening length , and @xmath29 is the acceleration . for the gas particles , the time step must also satisfy @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the sph smoothing length , @xmath33 is the shear coefficient and @xmath34 is the viscosity coefficient .",
    "@xmath35 is described in @xcite .",
    "the sph quantities were calculated on a kernel using 32 nearest neighbors .",
    "the cooling in all runs is calculated without taking into account the metal content of the gas .",

    "due to the spin , the gas naturally settles into a rotationally - supported disk in the center of the halo , giving rise to a galactic disk comprised of a mix of stars and gas .",
    "thus , although all of the simulations presented here are idealized in the sense that the disks evolve in isolation the simulations also depart sharply from most other work using idealized disks because we do not _ construct _ equilibrium disk models , as is usually done in studies focusing on dynamical effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead",
    ", our models grow disks spontaneously without any biases regarding disk structure or stellar population properties .",
    "the spontaneous growth is particularly important for the development of self - limiting structure and subsequent secular evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we are therefore able to follow the temporal evolution of stellar populations and make direct comparisons between simulated properties and observed galaxies with unprecedented detail .",
    "real disks of course do not form in such a simple way , but our simulations are meant only to mimic the formation of disks after the last major merger . for massive galaxies ( @xmath42 ) disk formation is not dominated by filamentary accretion after z@xmath432 @xcite .",
    "minor mergers may influence the morphology of the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the majority of the disk fuel comes from quiescent cooling of gas from the halo .    by limiting the processes included in our models , we can perform a cleaner analysis of the disk dynamics . because of lower computational cost compared to fully - cosmological simulations , we are also able to attain higher resolution . at the fiducial resolution , for example , the disks have @xmath43 2.5 million star particles by 10 gyr - typical hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of @xmath44 galaxies have a few times fewer disk particles",
    "however , by allowing our disks to form spontaneously without a pre - defined stellar component , we can follow the evolution of stellar populations self - consistently throughout the simulation .",
    "we begin by dissecting the spiral structure in our fiducial simulation to show that spirals are responsible for the migration of stars . for several decades ,",
    "idealized @xmath2-body simulations have produced self - limiting , transient spirals arising from various sources of instability , such as poisson noise , discontinuities in the distribution function @xcite , or stimulation by the central bar @xcite .",
    "studies of the evolution of transient spiral structure have largely been confined to the realm of carefully - tuned @xmath2-body experiments , sometimes with an addition of gas hydrodynamics or an ad - hoc cooling mechanism @xcite .",
    "cooling is essential for the persistence of transient spirals because spirals are naturally self - destructive : when they form , they also very efficiently heat the disk . controlled and carefully tuned @xmath2-body experiments are vital for understanding the orbit response of the underlying disk to perturbing wave propagation , but do not adequately address how spontaneously recurring patterns may affect stars in a real disk .",

    "stars are initially on kinematically cool orbits inherited from their parent gas particles , continuously infusing the disk with a population susceptible to supporting instabilities .",

    ", this type of decomposition will identify any type of azimuthal m - fold symmetry , but our assumption is that strong components identified in this way with low @xmath52 will be due either to a bar or spirals .",
    "the bar can be separated from spirals by virtue of its constant phase as a function of radius ; however , beyond the central few kpc we can reasonably expect this method to identify spirals .",
    "figure  [ fig : stellar_density_fourier_maps ] shows stellar density maps with contours of m=1 through m=4 fourier components , obtained using equations [ eq : fourier_expansion ] and [ eq : fourier_coefficients ] , demonstrating that our method can reliably identify and account for the underlying disk structure .",
    "it is also apparent from figure  [ fig : stellar_density_fourier_maps ] that there are often distinct spirals present at different radii and that each spiral often has a narrowly - defined peak overdensity .",
    "the overdensities we measure vary with time but the normalized amplitude of the m=2 mode @xmath61 at all times for all runs , compatible with the observations of @xcite .",
    "overdensities at the level of a few per cent are difficult to see by eye in the stellar surface density map , but are easily identified with a fourier decomposition .    in a spontaneously - evolving disk , we expect patterns of all multiplicities to exist , and they all could perturb the orbits of stars . in figure",
    "[ fig : global_fourier ] we show the global fourier amplitude as a function of time for m=1 through m=5 fourier components .",
    "the m=2 mode dominates at all times in this simulation .",

    "the greatest impact of spiral structure on the orbits of stars occurs at resonances , which are narrow regions in phase space satisfying @xmath62 , where @xmath52 is the pattern multiplicity , @xmath63 and @xmath47 are the azimuthal and radial frequencies of the orbit and @xmath64 is the spiral s pattern speed . if @xmath65 , setting @xmath66 to @xmath67 gives the inner and outer lindblad resonances ( ilr and olr ) , and @xmath68 corresponds to the corotation resonance ( cr ) . to identify resonances",
    ", we must therefore obtain @xmath64 , which can be achieved using our fourier decomposition .",
    "we can estimate the instantaneous @xmath64 at radius @xmath51 simply by performing numerical differentiation @xmath69 or , equivalently , obtaining a linear fit to @xmath53 as a function of time .",
    "this method is reliable if there is a single steady perturbation at the radius in question , and studies of bars usually employ this method to recover the bar pattern speed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we find , however , that for our purposes this is insufficient because spirals of varying strengths and pattern speeds are present at all radii , and this method only ever identifies the most prominent pattern .    to reliably identify multiple pattern speeds in the disk , we require a different method .",
    "ideally , the method would not only allow us to identify patterns at a given time interval , but it would also give us information about the evolution of these patterns with time .",
    "however , because the coefficients @xmath54 are calculated at each output , they comprise a time series and we can obtain a further discrete fourier transform of this series , given by @xmath70 @xcite , which yields the fourier coefficients at discrete frequencies @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the coefficient at time @xmath73 , radius @xmath51 and multiplicity @xmath52 .",

    "we are here faced with a choice between spectral resolution and the ability to identify `` instantaneous '' pattern speeds .",
    "if the baseline used is too long , the power spectrum will show a large number of patterns not all of which are important for the disk at any particular time .",
    "we find that at our timestep resolution of 10 myr , using a 1 gyr ( 100 timesteps ) baseline gives satisfactory spectra , though the resolution is still rather coarse at @xmath79  .",

    "the contours in the panels on the left show the frequency power spectrum as a function of radius , while the right panel shows the integrated power over the whole disk at each frequency .    , while the dashed black lines mark @xmath83 .",

    "contour levels vary in logarithm from @xmath84 to @xmath85.,width=336 ]    the pattern speeds in the given segment of the disk evolution can now be obtained by extracting the peaks from the radially integrated frequency spectrum .",
    "we measure the peaks by fitting gaussians to the local maxima in the integrated spectrum . to reliably identify overlapping features in the spectrum we use an iterative procedure , which progressively removes the most prominent peaks identifying lesser peaks on subsequent passes . in this way",
    ", we identify the three most important patterns .",
    "we use the gaussian fit parameters to estimate peak amplitudes and pattern speeds .",
    "the horizontal lines in the left panel of figure  [ fig : frequencies ] correspond to the pattern speeds obtained in this way and illustrate that this method can recover the major pattern speeds well .",
    "the solid and dashed black lines show @xmath86 , the circular frequency , and @xmath87 - ilr , cr , and olr resonances exist for stars on nearly circular orbits where the pattern speed lines intersect one of these loci , from left to right respectively .    figure  [ fig : frequencies ] reveals the richness of spiral structure in a spontaneously evolving disk .",
    "the range of radii that may be influenced by resonances from any of these patterns spans essentially the entire disk .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : frequencies ] only tells us about the patterns present in a given time interval - we would like to know how these patterns evolve with time .    to extract time information from our data , we repeat the above procedure at equally - spaced time intervals .",
    "we show such a result in the figure  [ fig : patspeed_sequence_fiducial ] .",
    "the dominant frequencies are shown as a function of time , identified using the procedure outlined above , with individual point sizes reflecting the normalized amplitude of each perturbation .",
    "each point on the plot uses a baseline of 1 gyr of data to generate the power spectrum as discussed above , so that at each time @xmath88 the patterns shown reflect disk evolution from @xmath89 to @xmath88 .",
    "hence , adjacent points represent overlapping data and the point sizes reflect a time - averaged amplitude .",
    "the instantaneous amplitudes vary on much shorter timescales as the spirals flicker in and out of existence .",
    "it is striking that the perturbation at @xmath90   dominates through most of the disk s lifetime .",
    "this perturbation is very steady except for a brief decrease at 5.5 gyr and a subsequent strong growth peaking at 7.5 gyr .",
    "the brief period of decreased power can also be identified in the panels of figure  [ fig : stellar_density_fourier_maps ] , which show that between 5 - 6 gyr the patterns become significantly disordered .",
    "figure  [ fig : patspeed_sequence_fiducial ] also shows that perturbations with larger frequencies are significantly more short - lived .",
    "we can identify three separate strong perturbations with @xmath91  , the most persistent of which survives for @xmath92 gyr .",
    "the time evolution of pattern speeds and amplitudes shown in figure  [ fig : patspeed_sequence_fiducial ] provides a new look at the temporal evolution of the disk .",
    "we double - checked that the signal extracted using the windowed fft ( wfft ) method is indeed real by performing an independent analysis using a continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) , because it is specifically tailored to recover the time - evolution of frequencies in a signal .",
    "the cwt yields qualitatively identical results to the wfft - however , we found it less cumbersome to quantify the results ( i.e. determine pattern speeds and amplitudes ) using the wfft .    while figure  [ fig : patspeed_sequence_fiducial ] shows the evolution of frequencies , it does not allow one to infer the amplitude variations of individual patterns because the wfft is performed on 0.5 gyr intervals",
    "therefore , while we do see variation in the sizes of the points , corresponding to amplitude changes , there is a possibility that we are hiding shorter time - scale fluctuations .",
    "we attempt to reconstruct the amplitude variation of individual patterns directly by using a band - pass filter in frequency space and then using the inverse fourier transform to obtain the time series of fourier coefficients representing the density perturbation .",
    "the band - pass is centered roughly on the desired frequency and is 10 km / s / kpc wide .",
    "the choice of width is somewhat arbitrary , but we find that the patterns are reasonably well separated with this choice .",
    "figure  [ fig : spiral_amps ] shows the resulting amplitude variations for the three principal patterns found in figure  [ fig : frequencies ] .",
    "the oscillatory amplitude transience of spirals on gyr timescales in our run is clearly visible .",
    "note that apart from the slowest pattern , the pattern speeds are also evolving on @xmath43  gyr timescales ( see figure  [ fig : patspeed_sequence_fiducial ] ) .",
    "however , while the evolving pattern speeds mean that resonances associated with these patterns are sweeping through the disk , our system does not produce a multitude of strong features of a wide range of pattern speeds at any given time .",
    "thus , the transience in the system described here might be somewhat different from that found in other works .    .",
    "the amplitudes are obtained by using a band - pass of 10 km / s / kpc centered on each frequency and at a radius corresponding to the corotation radius at 7 gyr ( i.e. identified using the power spectrum of figure  [ fig : frequencies ] . because the amplitudes of the faster patterns are quite different , we use the left y - axis for the 20 - 30 km / s / kpc pattern ( red line ) , and the right y - axis for the other two ( green and blue lines).,width=307 ]",
    "in the previous section , we demonstrated that the disk in our simulation harbors a variety of spiral patterns of various pattern speeds .",
    "we now discuss how these patterns influence the orbits of stars .",
    "in particular , we try to understand whether the radial migration in our growing , unconstrained disk can be explained by the cr scattering described in sb02 alone , or whether we must invoke more complex mechanisms to explain the observed behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig : redist_plots ] illustrates the diversity of individual stellar orbital histories in the disk .",

    "it is clear from these examples that stars may migrate rapidly while retaining a nearly circular orbit , and that a circular orbit does not imply a radially static history .",
    "in fact the instantaneous appearance of an orbit says very little about the star s history , as it is evidently possible to even circularize a significantly eccentric orbit ( see , for example , the upper - right panel ) .     given initial @xmath93 for all particles in the simulation between 5.3 - 5.5 gyr ( top panel ) and 6.5 - 7.0 gyr ( bottom panel ) .",

    "if we use a 1 gyr baseline ( which corresponds to @xmath97 rotation periods at 5 gyr and 8 kpc ) we find that the signature of spiral scattering in the vs. @xmath93 plane becomes too smeared to be useful . on the other hand , a 0.5 gyr baseline is insufficient to reliably identify pattern speeds in the power spectrum , so we are forced to accept this small inconsistency .",
    "the higher frequency perturbations may evolve considerably during @xmath98 , but the resonance loci are not a particularly steep function of @xmath99 ( figure  [ fig : frequencies ] ) so we can still obtain approximate locations of resonances . in figure",
    "[ fig : spiral_amps ] we can see that during 6.5 - 7 gyr we may expect the disk to be largely dominated by the growth of the  45 km / s / kpc pattern .",
    "however , during the 5.3 - 5.5 gyr time interval , we see that the two faster patterns are growing at the same time .",
    "it is also apparent from figure  [ fig : patspeed_sequence_fiducial ] that around this time the faster pattern dominates the overall perturbation amplitude in the main part of the disk .",

    "another possibility is that patterns of higher multiplicity contribute to some of the angular momentum exchange .",
    "the prominent feature seen in the very inner part of the disk in ther bottom panel is a short - lived weak bar instability .",
    "note the scale of @xmath100 : in both panels the changes caused by the dominant pattern approach 50% of @xmath93 .",
    "the changes are especially drastic in the top panel , given the short time interval we are considering .",
    "a _ steady _ spiral perturbation does not result in angular momentum exchange at the cr because stars are trapped on horseshoe orbits .",
    "if the spiral is transient , however , the trapping does not occur and stars can traverse from one side of the cr to another .",
    "we look for such horseshoe orbits during the time interval 6.5 - 7 gyr among the particles with @xmath101 ( roughly the top 10 percent of migrators ) around the cr with the 43 km / s / kpc pattern shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : dj_j_tot ] .",
    "we plot the orbits of a random subset of these particles in a frame corotating with the spiral in columns 1 and 3 of figure  [ fig : horseshoes ] .",

    "for example , see the outward migrators in panels 1 , 2 and 3 and the inward migrators in panels 6 and 7 .",
    "this hints at the cr being responsible for the migration because one expects the particles trailing the spiral arm to preferentially be pulled outward and vice versa for those particles leading the arm .    in figure",
    "[ fig : migrator_density ] we demonstrate that this is indeed the case by plotting the density of inward and outward migrators ( in red and blue respectively - darker colors indicate higher density ) for the 5.3 - 5.5 gyr time interval ( top panel ) and 6.5 - 6.7 gyr time interval ( bottom panel ) .",
    "spiral overdensity , reconstructed from @xmath65 through @xmath102 fourier components , is shown in black contours .",
    "the first interval is chosen because it is near the time when two of the patterns are peaking simultaneously , while during the later time interval only the 43 km / s / kpc spiral peaks .",
    "note that we did not select these particles specifically to isolate ones interacting with either spiral .",
    "the only selection criterion is that in the given time interval they are in the top 5 percent of migrators .",
    "however , essentially all of the migration in both time intervals is occuring around the crs with most of the inward and outward migrators respectively leading and trailing the dominant spiral .",
    "low densities of migrators extend to other regions of the disk where other spirals play a role , but the majority of migration is taking place around the 43 km / s / kpc spiral , as expected from figure  [ fig : dj_j_tot ] . the dashed green circle corresponds to the cr of the 43 km / s / kpc spiral and passes directly through the centers of the highest density regions of migrators .    the top panel , showing the migrators for the time interval where two of the faster patterns are peaking simultaneously shows very similar behavior to the bottom panel where only one pattern is dominating .",
    "if the overlap of resonances was causing chaotic evolution , it should manifest itself during such a time interval ( the dominant patterns are @xmath103 and 30  km / s / kpc ) . around a radius of 5  kpc in the top panel ,",
    "the density of both inward and outward migrators is saturated , implying that the migration is even more dominated by a single pattern in this time interval .",
    "the physical locations of the migrators are strongly clustered around the individual overdensity peaks . in this interval",
    ", there is also a weak oval feature in the center , driving some angular momentum exchange in the inner part the disk ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig : dj_j_tot ] ) .",
    "the dashed green circle in this panel corresponds to the cr of the 65 km / s / kpc spiral , which is clearly where most of the angular momentum exchange is occuring .",
    "thus it is evident that even when multiple strong patterns are present near their amplitude peaks , the majority of angular momentum exchange occurs at very predictable locations , i.e. on either side of overdensity peaks and at their cr .",
    "the migration in this earlier time interval is stronger , hinting at the possibility that different patterns may help feed each other s cr zones .",

    "we construct the power scalogram by using the morlet - grossmann wavelet whose basis `` mother '' wavelet is given by @xmath104 see @xcite for a thorough theoretical introduction to wavelets and @xcite and @xcite for a practical guide .",
    "we use the approach described in the latter two for calculating our wavelet power scalograms .",
    "the @xmath105-axis in the spectrograms in figure  [ fig : horseshoes ] represents wavelet scale , which is proportional to the inverse of frequency .",
    "we can therefore follow the time evolution of dominant frequencies by inspecting the most prominent ridges in the scalogram .",
    "note that we plot the logarithm of the power , so many of the smaller features are orders of magnitude weaker than the obvious dominant ridges .",
    "chaotic systems can be identified with this method because the ridges in the scalogram show significantly irregular curvature and discontinuities @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that in chaotic systems , ridges in the scalogram become shorter , bent , and disordered . in our case , we find in general mostly horizontal features extending across much of the entire time interval during which migration takes place . as the stars cross corotation and migrate in radius , the dominant frequency has to change and this is reflected in the bend apparent in the main ridge in all the panels . however , there is no evidence of significantly scattered and bent ridges ( see for example figure  4 in @xcite and figure  13 of @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of obvious evidence for chaos is particularly important for particles that migrate significantly in a short amount of time . to investigate this further",

    "these two particles are chosen for their extreme rates of migration , where we may also expect to detect hints of nonlinear - effects . in the left columns of the top two rows of figure  [ fig : horseshoes_large_dr ]",
    "we show the the orbits corotating with the faster , @xmath103  km / s / kpc pattern , and in the middle panels the orbits are in the frame of the @xmath107  km / s / kpc spiral .",
    "as in figure  [ fig : horseshoes ] , the orbits are colored according to the relative strength of the two spirals , whose amplitudes are shown in the bottom row .",

    "both particles cross the cr at almost the same time near the peak of the spiral amplitude , similar to the particles in figure  [ fig : horseshoes ] .",
    "the two particles are first taken to the middle of the disk by the faster pattern and happen to be deposited near the corotation resonance and near the peak of the spiral pattern dominating there .",
    "they are therefore quickly taken further outward by this second , slower spiral .",
    "thus , their rapid migration is simply due to two successive corotation resonances . as before , the wavelet transform power spectrum shown in the rightmost column of figure  [ fig : horseshoes_large_dr ] shows little evidence for significantly chaotic evolution .         in the given time interval .",

    "the jacobi integral , @xmath108 is conserved in the rotating frame of a single , steady perturbation @xcite . in our system",
    "we do not expect @xmath109 to be exactly conserved anywhere since multiple patterns are always present in the disk , and the disk potential itself is constantly changing due to accretion of fresh gas and star formation .",
    "however , if single spirals are mostly responsible for instantaneous changes in @xmath93 of individual stars , we would expect that for short time intervals the distribution of @xmath110 to be peaked and centered at zero for particles in the vicinity of each of the major cr regions .",
    "we select particles for these distributions by determining the @xmath111 , i.e. the angular momentum of circular orbits at each cr , and then selecting the top 10 percent of migrators with initial @xmath93 within 10 percent of @xmath111 .",
    "in essence , we are selecting narrow strips of particles on either side of each cr line shown in figure  [ fig : dj_j_tot ] .",
    "note that we determined the pattern speeds in the 6.5 - 6.7 case separately from those determined in figure  [ fig : frequencies ] and there is a slight discrepancy due to pattern speed evolution over gyr timescales .",

    "the distributions for the faster perturbations are broadened for several reasons .",
    "first , the spiral amplitudes are variable which broadens their effective resonant frequencies .",
    "second , in the inner disk other weaker patterns may be affecting the orbits .",
    "still , it is striking that even in the 5.3 - 5.5 gyr time interval , which was chosen specifically because multiple strong patterns are peaking at the same time ( see also bottom panel of figure  [ fig : migrator_density ] ) , the distributions do not appear qualitatively any different than for the quieter 6.5 - 6.7 gyr time interval .",
    "the higher density of migrators seen in figure  [ fig : migrator_density ] could be due to several factors .",
    "first , the disk density is significantly higher at the cr of the 60 km / s / kpc spiral .",
    "the angular momentum exchange could further be facilitated by the presence of other perturbations , essentially feeding the cr of the dominant spiral .",
    "nevertheless , even if the efficiency of migration is boosted due to the presence of other patterns , the fact that the distributions shown in figure  [ fig : dedj_hist ] are centered and peaked at zero implies that the bulk of the angular momentum exchange still proceeds due to the cr of the individual spirals and that chaotic orbital evolution caused by the overlap of several resonances may not be the dominant cause of migration in this system . note that the shift to the left from zero for the red distribution in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : dedj_hist ] is just a few km / s / kpc and therefore well within the measurement errors for @xmath64 .",
    "similarly , we examine the evolution of @xmath109 for the two particles shown in figure  [ fig : horseshoes_large_dr ] that undergo very large migration over a short time interval . in the bottom right panel",
    "we show the fractional changes in the jacobi integral for these two particles .",
    "the fractional change for the faster pattern is measured with respect to the beginning of the time interval , whereas for the slower pattern we measure it with respect to the end of the interval ( this is because initially the particles interact with the faster pattern and only later with the slower pattern ) . between 5 - 5.6 gyr ,",

    "particles are selected in the same way as for figure  [ fig : dedj_hist ] ( for brevity , we only show the middle pattern that causes the largest amount of mixing ) . from the rotation curve and the midplane potential ,",
    "we calculate the theoretical circular orbit locus in the @xmath114 plane .",
    "based on this locus we calculate the maximum allowable angular momentum , @xmath115 , of each particle based on its energy and express the circularity of its orbit as @xmath116 .",
    "we calculate the mass weighted distribution of @xmath117 as a function of @xmath118 which can be expressed as @xmath119 where the subscript @xmath120 indicates individual particle quantities , @xmath52 is the mass , and @xmath2 is the total number of particles .",
    "the corresponding cumulative distribution function is given by @xmath121 and shown in figure  [ fig : dj_distributions ] .",
    "note that even for particles on fairly eccentric orbits , changes in @xmath93 are possible , but those are most likely occurring at the lindblad resonances .",
    "however , the contribution of those stars to the overall changes in @xmath93 is miniscule . the particles with  @xmath122 account for over 50% of the angular momentum exchange .",
    "this follows since @xmath117 is largest for those particles , but also simply due to the fact that the disk is kinematically cool and particles on mostly circular orbits are also most abundant .",
    "however , the mass distribution ( shown by the dashed line in the same panel ) is much less peaked than the angular momentum distribution , confirming that particles on circular orbits are most important for the exchange of angular momentum .     ",

    "the speeds of the main patterns are similar to the runs in the top row ( fiducial , t1 , t2 ) .",
    "we also see an even slower pattern , probably due to increased particle numbers , which make its detection in the far outer disk possible .    finally ,",
    "because dark matter particles are constantly bombarding the disk , we explored the possibility that their perturbations may influence the generation of spirals . in the bottom - left panel of figure  [ fig : fourier_bins ] , we show the m=2 amplitude for run sdm , which was initialized with 10 times as many dm particles .",
    "other properties of the run were kept the same as in the fiducial run .",
    "spiral amplitudes are very similar to the fiducial run , although the innermost pattern seems to be missing . in the corresponding panel in figure",
    "[ fig : patspeed_sequence ] the frequencies as a function of time for the run sdm appear very similar to the fiducial run . at most times , the dominant frequencies present in both disks are essentially the same .    while we have achieved convergence with increasing mass resolution , the discrepancy between our lowest resolution run , r1 , and the rest of the suite is puzzling .",
    "we tested for the effect of two - body relaxation by increasing the softening and by increasing the number of particles in the dm halo .",
    "we also tested for potential integration issues stemming from different softenings between the baryons and the dm ( note that in all of our runs the dm and baryons use different softening , and this is standard practice in such simulations ) . making the baryon softening equal to the dm softening was the only experiment that yielded results more in line with other runs .      in the preceding subsections we investigated the detailed evolution of spirals in our simulation suite ,",
    "but how do these simulations compare in their global properties ? in figure  [ fig : a2_mean ] we show the mean m=2 amplitude , @xmath136 , calculated over the duration of the entire simulation , and its standard deviation represented by the error bars .",
    "stochasticity and choice of softening minimally impact the global disk evolution , though all of the s - series runs have slightly smaller @xmath136 , especially s4 .",
    "a true outlier is r1 , with lower @xmath136 than the rest of the suite .",
    "the properties of spirals are important in our understanding of radial migration because of their effect on the distribution of stars in the disk .",
    "we have seen in figures  [ fig : fourier_bins ] and [ fig : patspeed_sequence ] that while the range of admissible pattern speeds is not sensitive to choices of numerical parameters , the timing of the spirals can differ substantially .",
    "depending on the configuration of the disk , this could affect the migration rates and ultimately , the predictions we extract from these models for studies of disk stellar populations .",
    "it is difficult to quantitatively assess the spiral structure , though we have attempted to do so in figure  [ fig : a2_mean ] and found no appreciable differences in the suite apart from run r1 .",
    "however , we can quantitatively analyze the properties of resulting stellar populations in a given region of the disk .",
    "a natural region to examine is the model analog to the solar neighborhood . in the top panels of figure  [ fig : rform_dist ]",
    "we show the distributions of formation radii for stars that are found within @xmath137[kpc]@xmath138 at the end of the simulation .",
    "this choice is particularly important because we have addressed this same region in our previous works ( r08b , @xcite ) .",
    "the bottom panels show the corresponding cumulative distributions .",
    "the solid black line in all panels corresponds to the fiducial run - the left , middle , and right columns show the stochasticity , softening , and resolution tests respectively .",
    "the leftmost panels show that stochasticity has little overall effect on the cumulative distributions of @xmath139 - at 50% the difference is @xmath140  kpc .",
    "nevertheless , the distribution in the top panel shows that the fiducial run may even over - produce the in - situ stars .    in the remaining cumulative distributions , the overall variance at 50%",
    "does not exceed that of the stochasticity tests .",
    "two notable cases are apparent - the run s1 and run sdm .",
    "run s1 , is more heavily dominated by in - situ stars .",
    "this agrees with the fact that this run develops weaker spiral structure in the final gyr",
    ". however , the appearance of the larger peak of in - situ stars for the run s1 may also simply be another manifestation of stochasticity - when we recreate the same distributions 2 gyr earlier , the run s1 follows almost exactly the fiducial distribution .    for run sdm ,",
    "the peak of the @xmath139 distribution is actually shifted away from the solar neighborhood .",
    "this implies even more drastic mixing , and is indeed also apparent when we repeat the experiment at 8 gyr ( as mentioned in the previous paragraph ) . regardless of these subtle variations , the fact that @xmath1 of solar neighborhood stars originated in other parts of the disk remains robust .",
    "contrary to what we might expect for run r1 given figures  [ fig : fourier_bins ] , [ fig : patspeed_sequence ] and [ fig : a2_mean ] , where we found that it has weaker spiral structure on average from other runs , we find here only a small difference in the solar neighborhood population .",
    "we would expect the resultant migration to be much less than in the other runs .",
    "we therefore studied the spiral structure in this run in more detail and found that while the disk does not support strong spirals , it is permeated with weaker and highly transient features .",
    "we find that the transience is much more pronounced than in the other runs .",
    "using a 1 gyr baseline power spectrum , as in figure  [ fig : frequencies ] , we find essentially a continuous spectrum of patterns emerges , compared with few distinct features .",
    "this is apparent also in figure  [ fig : patspeed_sequence ] , where many weak patterns at a variety of pattern speeds are identified .",
    "the pattern speeds shift on short timescales , allowing even the weak structure to relatively efficiently redistribute the stars .",
    "radial migration is rapidly becoming recognized as a critical process in disk galaxies because of its wide - ranging implications .",
    "if this process has been important for the milky way , it most likely played a key role in determining the mix of stars in the solar neighborhood today @xcite . on a broader scale , it has likely influenced the stellar population gradients measured in the milky way disk and other galaxies @xcite , and contributed substantially to the stellar density in the outermost disk regions ( @xcite , 2012 , in press ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated in detail the origin of radial migration by analyzing the spontaneously - forming spiral structure and the resultant resonant angular momentum exchange .",
    "we found that the spiral structure is transient in amplitude , but appears to support only a few discrete pattern speeds at any given time .",
    "this means that some stars can be tossed from the cr of one pattern to another , resulting in large changes in radius on relatively short timescales .",
    "still , it is important to remember that extreme migrations of many kpc over the course of a star s lifetime are not the norm , they comprise the tail of the distribution .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : rform_dist ] - although @xmath4350% of the stars do come from elsewhere , this also means that the near - majority have formed in - situ .",
    "the situation changes with increasing radius , because the in - situ star formation decreases - thus , the tail of the distribution from the inner regions makes up the majority of the stellar population at large radii .",
    "we demonstrated in section  [ sec : angular_momentum_corotation ] that the largest angular momentum exchanges occur at the corotation of important m=2 spirals .",
    "an important aspect of our result is the confirmation that the largest angular momentum exchange happens for particles on the most circular orbits - and that these particles do not get heated by the spirals while they migrate ( sb02 ) .",
    "this is a crucial aspect of the cr migration mechanism because it means that the process is not self - limiting .",
    "instead , it can continue especially for the particles migrating the most , allowing for very large changes in radius for some of the stars , but without betraying their journey by anomalous kinematics .",
    "we have also searched for signs of chaotic orbital evolution in the vicinity of resonances , but found indication that stellar orbits remain rather regular as they migrate radially .",
    "we have found this to be the case even for very large migrations , and have shown that such migrations are possible in a short amount of time if a particle passes directly from the cr of one spiral to another ( see figures  [ fig : horseshoes ] and  [ fig : horseshoes_large_dr ] ) .",
    "our results show that the redistribution of stars in mw - type disks on very short timescales is inevitable if transient spiral structure is present . even in the case of run",
    "r1 , where the mid - disk spirals appear to be numerically suppressed , a large fraction of stars ending up in the solar neighborhood originated in the interior of the disk . therefore , our findings suggest that the effects of recurring , spontaneous spiral structure are a key component of disk evolution that models simply _ must _ include if they wish to make predictions about kinematic and chemical properties of stellar populations",
    ". cosmological simulations , which fail to form disks that can support spiral structure may be missing critical aspects of disk evolution and therefore the detailed properties of resulting disk stellar populations must be used with care . on the other hand , the inclusion of substructure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is important not only because mergers can heat and disrupt the disk , but also because they may trigger transient structure .",
    "we hope that it should soon be possible to use state - of - the - art cosmological simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) for detailed studies of radial migration .",
