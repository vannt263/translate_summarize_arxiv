    "micro - swimmers , including motile bacteria and artificial swimmers , swim at low reynolds number by using a periodic non - reciprocal motion , i.e. motion lacking time - inversion symmetry . since their motion",
    "is governed by the stokes equation , which is linear , a reciprocal motion does not induce any time - average net migration of the center - of - mass  @xcite .",
    "micro - swimmers break reciprocality of the motion , for example , by rotating one or more helical flagella attached to the cell body that counter - rotates as a result ( e.g. _ e. coli _ ) , or by performing `` power '' and `` recovery '' strokes or the breaststroke motion with flagella ( e.g. _ chlamydomonas _ ) , or by propagating a wave on a flexible flagellum from the base of the cell body to the free end ( e.g. sea urchin spermatozoon )  @xcite .",
    "these micro - swimmers can be categorized into `` pullers '' , `` pushers '' or combinations of the two , depending on the swimming motion .",
    "we here define a puller / pusher as a micro - swimmer that on average pulls / pushes fluid to / away from the cell along the swimming axis over one period of its swimming motion .",
    "examples of pullers are _ chlamydomonas _ and _ chrysomonad _ , and pushers include the sea urchin spermatozoon and _",
    "e. coli_. some micro - swimmers , such as _ e. coli _ and _ chlamydomonas _ , intersperse straight `` running motion '' with `` tumbles '' allowing them to reorient their movement stochastically towards a more favorable environment or possibly to reduce their chances of encountering predators  @xcite    the two - bead swimmer has been proposed as a simple model of a micro - swimmer to study the collective dynamics of the swimmers and their behavior near a wall  @xcite .",
    "however , since the two - bead swimmer does not account for a periodic non - reciprocal swimming motion , it can not generate the time - dependent flow around the swimmer , which is stronger than the time - averaged flow  @xcite and which can induce synchronization of the swimming motions of multiple swimmers .",
    "thus , the three - bead swimmer , which is the simplest model that accounts for a periodic non - reciprocal motion , has also been proposed  @xcite and used to study the interactions of multiple swimmers  @xcite . however , as we shall describe here , the swimming motion in these early studies on the three - bead swimmer is actually a combination of simpler puller and pusher swimming motions .    here , we propose minimal one- , two- and three - dimensional puller / pusher micro - swimmer models , and two- and three - dimensional run - and - tumble swimming motions . by simulations using a bead - spring model ,",
    "we find that the tumbling motion can be easily induced by breaking symmetry of the swimming motion with respect to the swimming axis .",
    "finally , we propose a five - bead swimmer as a minimal model for a swimmer with a helical flagellum and rotary motor attached to the cell body ( i.e. `` corkscrew swimmer ''  @xcite ) .",
    "this five - bead swimmer accounts for the hydrodynamic effects of the rotation of the flagellum and the counter - rotation of the cell body as well as the periodic non - reciprocal swimming motion .",
    "it is found that this swimmer , when placed near a wall , reproduces the behavior of _ e. coli _ ,",
    "which is attracted to the wall  @xcite and swims clockwise , when viewed perpendicular to the wall through the fluid  @xcite , despite the fact that the swimmer does not have a helical tail nor helical motion .",
    "our minimal model of a one - dimensional swimmer consists of three colinear beads connected by two bonds whose lengths change in a non - reciprocal manner .",
    "this geometry is identical to that of previous studies  @xcite , but we induce different cycles ( or periodic histories ) of bond - lengths .",
    "examples of non - reciprocal cycles of the two bond lengths , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that we impose are depicted in @xmath0-@xmath1 space in fig .  [ swimmers ] .",
    "this swimmer can swim at low reynolds number by repeating a non - reciprocal cycle of bond - lengths .",
    "we confirmed that the bond - length histories in fig .",
    "[ swimmers ] induce migration of the swimmer by simulations using the bead - spring model . in the simulations ,",
    "three spherical beads with hydrodynamic radius @xmath2 are connected by two fene - fraenkel springs  @xcite of time - dependent equilibrium lengths @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which follow a configurational history shown in fig .",
    "[ swimmers ] . the fene - fraenkel spring force @xmath5 with equilibrium length @xmath6 is written as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are indexes of beads , @xmath10 is a vector connecting @xmath11 ( position vector of bead @xmath9 ) to @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the spring constant , and the deformed spring length @xmath14 is restricted to a range set by the parameter @xmath15 , which is @xmath16 in our simulations .",
    "the motion of each bead of the swimmer is computed according to the following equation with the force distribution on beads given by the spring forces , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the velocity vector of bead @xmath8 at time @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the position vector of bead @xmath8 , @xmath21 is the force on bead @xmath9 , @xmath22 is the total number of beads in the swimmer , @xmath23 is the time increment in the simulation , and @xmath24 is a hydrodynamic interaction tensor . for @xmath24 , we use the oseen tensor  @xcite with the point - force approximation , or the rotne - prager - yamakawa ( rpy ) tensor  @xcite with more accurate hydrodynamics up to terms of order @xmath25 .    by superposing the hydrodynamic interactions between beads ,",
    "this equation with the spring forces on beads captures the dynamics of the swimmer . although both cycles a and b in fig .  [ swimmers ] induce migration of the center - of - mass at the same speed in the same direction , our simulations show that the resulting cycle - averaged flow fields differ .",
    "the far - field cycle - averaged flow of cycle a corresponds to that of a puller and cycle b to a pusher , and both flows decay as @xmath26 .",
    "the cycle - averaged flow of the pusher is surprisingly similar to that of a detailed bead - spring model of _",
    "e. coli _ in a run  @xcite except that the flow of the three - bead swimmer does not have angular velocity components around the swimming axis ( see fig .",
    "[ flows ] ) .    by combining the cycle histories of the pusher and the puller",
    ", we can create a `` square '' history in @xmath0-@xmath1 space shown in fig .",
    "[ swimmers]:cycle c , which corresponds to the swimming motion of the najafi - golestanian swimmer  @xcite .",
    "the cycle - averaged flow of this history is a combination of the flows of a puller and a pusher , which decays as @xmath27 because the dipole components of the flow cancel in a cycle that consists of puller and pusher swimming motions .",
    "it is also possible to generate a net puller or a pusher by setting different ranges for the changes in @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite ( i.e. by making the `` square '' history into a `` rectangular '' one ) .",
    "here , we evaluate the migration per cycle of a three - bead swimmer whose cycle is represented by an arbitrary closed path in @xmath0-@xmath1 space . once a cycle motion is specified in @xmath0-@xmath1 space , the corresponding spring - force cycle in @xmath28-@xmath29 space is also specified by eq .",

    "for example , if the time spent for a portion of a cycle becomes shorter ( e.g. @xmath41 ) following the same path , the migration speed becomes faster ( e.g. @xmath42 ) . as a result , the migration during the portion of the cycle stays the same .",
    "now , we first calculate the migration for a small rectangular cycle , which we refer as @xmath43 : @xmath38@xmath44@xmath45@xmath46@xmath47@xmath46@xmath48@xmath46@xmath49@xmath46@xmath45 .",

    "[ fig - g ] . note that @xmath52 is always positive when the cycle is counter - clockwise ( ccw ) in @xmath0-@xmath1 space , and the migration along a clockwise ( cw ) cycle becomes @xmath55 .",
    "since a cycle that does not enclose area in @xmath0-@xmath1 space induces no migration per cycle ( i.e. the scallop theorem  @xcite ) , a cycle can be divided into two or more cycles whose migrations sum up to the migrations of the original cycle ; see fig .",
    "[ fig - cycle - division ] .",
    "therefore , an arbitrary cycle can be divided into small rectangular cycles whose migrations sum to that of the original cycle , and the migration per arbitrary cycle ( @xmath36 ) can be written as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the area within the cycle .",
    "the result of @xmath36 calculated using eq",

    "[ fig - migration ] along with our simulation results using the oseen tensor and the rpy tensor .",
    "the theoretical result from eq .",
    "[ migration ] agrees well with the simulation results .",
    "note that the simulation results obtained using the rpy tensor deviates from our theoretical results based on the oseen tensor when @xmath60 is large because the rpy tensor , which accounts for more accurate hydrodynamics , diverges from the oseen tensor when the distance between beads becomes comparable to the bead radius @xmath2 .",
    "by taking advantage of the partitioning of a cycle described in the previous section , we here evaluate the cycle - averaged flow field around a swimmer .",
    "once we find the analytical expression for the cycle - averaged flow for an arbitrary cycle , we can distinguish between puller and pusher swimming from the cycle path in @xmath0-@xmath1 space , since its cycle - averaged far - field flow becomes dipolar as following : @xmath61^{2}-1 \\right ) \\frac{\\hat{\\bm{r}}}{r^{2}}+\\mathcal{o}(r^{-3}),\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the position vector relative to the position of the center bead of a three - bead swimmer , @xmath63 is the unit vector of @xmath62 , @xmath64 is the unit vector pointing in the swimming direction , and @xmath65 represents the strength of dipole , where the flow is that of a pusher when @xmath66 , that of a puller when @xmath67 , and neither a pusher nor a puller when @xmath68 .",
    "note that the far - field fluid displacement per cycle @xmath69 is an invariant of a cycle .",
    "for a small ccw rectangular cycle @xmath43 , the dipole strength @xmath70 can be evaluated analytically in a similar way as in the previous section using the oseen tensor , assuming @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a rational function ( see appendix a for the derivation ) .",
    "since a cycle enclosing no area in @xmath0-@xmath1 space induces no cycle - averaged flow field , we can use the `` cycle - division '' to obtain the dipole strength induced by an arbitrary cycle : @xmath75 from the contour plot of the function @xmath74 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - h ] , we find that 1 ) a cycle symmetric across the line @xmath76 induces no dipolar flow and the perturbation flow decays as @xmath27 , which is the same as a najafi - golestanian swimmer , and 2 ) if a ccw cycle is entirely in the region @xmath77 , the cycle - averaged flow is that of a puller , and if entirely in @xmath78 , that of a pusher . the result of @xmath79 calculated using eq .",
    "[ dipole ] for a ccw circular cycle of radius @xmath80 and centered at @xmath81 where @xmath82 is plotted in fig .  [ fig - dipole ] along with our simulation results using the oseen tensor and the rpy tensor .",
    "the theoretical result agrees well with the simulation results except that the simulation results with the rpy tensor diverges from the theoretical result because of its higher order accuracy compared to the oseen tensor .",
    "note also that if a cw cycle is entirely in the region @xmath77 , the cycle - averaged flow is that of a pusher , and if entirely in @xmath78 , that of a puller . a cycle - direction inversion ( ccw @xmath83 cw ) reverses the migration direction ( @xmath84 ) , and the sign of the flow dipole ( @xmath85 ) as shown in fig .",

    "[ cycle - time ] with given cycle time @xmath37 .",
    "the swimming direction of the one - dimensional three - bead swimmer is restricted to one dimension because of its linear geometry .",
    "however , we can easily construct a two - dimensional swimmer by using beads that are not colinear ( fig .",
    "[ swimmers ] ) . some micro - swimmers tumble and",
    "reorient the cell body by breaking symmetry of the swimming motion over the swimming axis .",
    "for example , _ chlamydomonas _ swims straight with synchronous beating of two flagella and tumbles with asynchronous beating  @xcite , and _ e. coli _ swims straight by rotating multiple helical flagella in a coherent rotational direction and tumbles by rotating at least one of the flagella in the reverse direction  @xcite .",
    "we confirmed by simulations using the bead - spring model with time - dependent equilibrium spring lengths analogous to the one - dimensional swimmer that our two - dimensional swimmer also tumbles by breaking symmetry of the swimming motion as shown in the cycle history in fig .",
    "[ swimmers ] . therefore , by alternating between the runs and tumbles , this two - dimensional swimmer can swim in a two - dimensional random - walk trajectory .",
    "we can also create a three - dimensional swimmer by using four or more non - coplanar beads , for example , on the vertexes of a tetrahedron or `` tetrumbbell ''  @xcite .",
    "this three - dimensional swimmer can swim straight with a periodic non - reciprocal motion analogous to that of the two - dimensional swimmer and tumble by breaking symmetry of the swimming motion ( see fig .",
    "[ swimmers ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that a tetrumbbell with constant equilibrium bond - lengths but different spring constants can migrate in a shear flow in the vorticity direction at low reynolds number  @xcite .",
    "this migration ( or `` swimming '' ) also results from a periodic non - reciprocal deformation induced by the shear flow on the tetrumbbell .",
    "all of these models will be useful for studying the low reynolds number hydrodynamics of micro - swimmers , the swimmer - swimmer interactions , and the collective dynamics of many swimmers . to study the multi - swimmer interactions of `` corkscrew swimmers '' such as _ e. coli _",
    ", however , we need to include the effect of the angular velocity around the swimmer induced by the rotation of the flagellum and the counter - rotation of the cell - body . in fig .",
    "[ fivebeadswimmer ] , we depict a five - bead swimmer that induces a time - average flow field corresponding to either a pusher or a puller plus this angular velocity .",
    "the five - bead swimmer swims via a periodic non - reciprocal motion of beads @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , just as the three - bead swimmer does , by changing the bond - lengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , torques @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and counter - torques @xmath104 and @xmath105 are applied as shown in fig .",
    "[ fivebeadswimmer ] to mimic the rotation of the flagellum and the counter - rotation of the cell - body .",
    "note that , for the total torque to be zero , the magnitudes of torques @xmath102 and @xmath103 must be the same , and also that when beads @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are colinear , torques @xmath104 and @xmath105 cancel out .",
    "each of these torques is first decomposed into two torques perpendicular to the bonds of the swimmer , and then each of these decomposed into forces on beads .",
    "for example , the force distribution on three connected beads @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath106 induced by a torque @xmath107 , which represents either @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 or @xmath105 , is ( see fig .",
    "[ fivebeadswimmer ] ) , @xmath108 to restrict the deformation of the swimmer , bending potentials are applied : @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , @xmath113 is the angle formed by beads @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath106 , @xmath114 is the equilibrium bending angle , @xmath115 is the bending potential constant , and we choose @xmath116 for our simulations .",
    "although the bending potentials allow small deformations of the swimmer  @xcite , neither the time - averaged flow field around the swimmer nor the swimming behavior are affected qualitatively for @xmath115 values as large or larger than that used here .",
    "the time for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a five - bead swimmer to traverse one side of a triangle in the configuration space is kept constant at the value @xmath117 .    by solving eq .",
    "[ eqofmotion ] with the force distribution on beads obtained by adding together all forces associated with torques and all spring and bending forces , we obtain the time - averaged flow field around a five - bead pusher swimmer , which we find to be very similar to that obtained from a detailed bead - spring model ( with 60 beads ) of _ e. coli _ with multiple helical flagella in a run  @xcite .",
    "input parameters with physical units in this simulation are @xmath118 ( maximum bond - length ) , @xmath34 ( solvent viscosity ) , and @xmath37 ( magnitude of torques ) . therefore , we scale length and time with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",

    "simulations were also performed for the five - bead pusher near a wall by employing the rpy tensor with the wall effect included  @xcite and a short - range repulsive potential between each bead and the wall with cut - off length @xmath120 .",
    "we find that the swimmer is attracted to the wall and swims clockwise ( see fig .  [ trajectory ] ) as observed in experiments and simulations with bacteria with helical flagella(um ) ( e.g. _ e. coli _ )  @xcite , despite the fact that the five - bead swimmer does not have a helical tail nor helical motion .",
    "therefore , the five - bead swimmer captures the experimentally observed behavior of _ e. coli _ qualitatively , and will allow us to simulate the collective dynamics of micro - swimmers more realistically than before at modest cost .",
    "we also confirmed that a three - dimensional tumbling motion of the five - bead swimmer can be induced by temporarily connecting beads @xmath99 and @xmath101 with a fene - fraenkel spring of constant equilibrium length @xmath118 while the bond - lengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 change in the same way as in a run , in other words , by forming a two - dimensional swimmer in a tumble with beads @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "simulations show that the trajectory of two five - bead pushers in a run , initially placed side by side and parallel to each other , agrees qualitatively with that obtained from a boundary element simulation of a modeled corkscrew swimmer , showing that two parallel swimmers first attract each other , and at the same time their swimming axes rotate in opposite directions  @xcite .",
    "we find that two side - by - side pullers behave similarly .",
    "we have developed simple micro - swimmer models by extending the najafi - golestanian three - bead linear swimmer model to allow arbitrary history of bond - lengths @xmath38 , by making the beads noncolinear to introduce tumbling , and by adding two additional non - collinear end beads to which torque and counter - torque are applied to induce a helical flow field around it , thus mimicking the swimming of flagellated bacteria .",
    "we have shown that both the migration distance and optimum energy consumption per cycle is an invariant of the cycle path , and can be computed , respectively , by area and path integrals over the cycle . for three - bead swimmers",
    ", we have also developed a simple criterion to distinguish puller from pusher swimmers , based on the cycle in @xmath0-@xmath1 space .",
    "finally , we have shown that our five - bead corkscrew swimmer spirals towards flat surfaces and interacts hydrodynamically with other five - bead swimmers in ways qualitatively similar to that of much more refined models of _ e.coli_. these minimal models of micro - swimmers will help in the study of the collective dynamics of micro - swimmers with a simplified but qualitatively accurate hydrodynamics .",
    "these models can also be used to study the synchronization of multiple swimmers if the bond - lengths are changed by applying time - constant , equal and opposite forces on the beads at the ends of each bond until the bond - length reaches a designated length , as proposed in a previous work  @xcite .",

    "<S> we also propose a five - bead model of a `` corkscrew swimmer '' , i.e. with a helical flagellum and a rotary motor attached to the cell body . </S>",
    "<S> our five - bead swimmer is attracted to a nearby wall , where it swims clockwise as observed in experiments with bacteria with helical flagella . </S>"
