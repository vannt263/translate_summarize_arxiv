    "one of the major issues in the present quantum information technology is the protection of quantum systems from external noise .",
    "the noise can be due to imprecise control or undesired interaction with the environment . to eliminate some errors of the first kind , geometric quantum computing ( gqc )",
    "has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the idea behind it is to use the so - called geometric phases @xcite to manipulate the quantum state .",
    "usually the appearance of a geometric phase is associated with a cyclic and adiabatic manipulation of the system .",
    "the advantage is twofold : the adiabatic evolution eliminates the problem of fine - tuning of the evolution time and the geometric operators can be intrinsically robust against fluctuations of the imprecise control field @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to realize universal quantum computing only by means of the abelian berry phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , utilizing the non - abelian geometric phases @xcite , the geometric quantum computing was proposed in 1999 @xcite . in this case , the logical states are encoded in a degenerate subspace of the full hilbert space and they can be manipulated by means of purely geometric non - abelian operators .",
    "the first proposals of the physical implementations were based on trapped ions and exploited the so - called tripod hamiltonian to build a doubly degenerate logical subspace @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the same hamiltonian has been used in many quantum systems providing means for possible implementation for neutral atoms , superconducting circuits , quantum dots , and bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in conjunction with these proposals ,",
    "various studies have been carried out to test the stability of geometric gates against different types of noise . here , gqc has proven robust against fast adiabatic fluctuations of control fields @xcite and certain type of environmental noise @xcite .    despite the theoretical efforts",
    ", we are still far from a full gqc , the experimental observations of non - abelian phases remain very limited and still under discussion @xcite .",
    "one possible reason behind the absence of experimental verification is the decoherence due to the interaction of the quantum system with the environment .",
    "in fact , because of the condition of adiabatic evolution , it is challenging to protect the system for long enough time to implement geometric operations .",
    "this is the case for all of the above proposals based on tripod - like hamiltonians in which the evolution does not occur in the lowest - energy eigenspace . in general",
    ", one expects that decoherence such as relaxation can be avoided if the evolution occurs in the ground - state manifold .",
    "the possibility to exploit this robustness in large systems to perform adiabatic quantum computation is still under discussion @xcite .",
    "however , the robustness of ground state evolution has been recently confirmed for a driven two - level system in the adiabatic limit  @xcite . in the same studies",
    ", it was shown that relaxation induced by the environment can help to keep the system in the ground state potentially leading to an improved robustness of the ground - state evolution .",
    "these results suggest that gqc which exploits a degenerate ground - state eigenspace can be experimentally feasible .",
    "the first step in this direction has been taken in ref .",
    "@xcite in which a way to detect non - abelian phases in superconducting josephson devices was proposed .",
    "however , the work mainly focused on observing the geometric non - abelian effects and only a particular unitary transformation was discussed .",
    "the extension to a universal set of transformations is non - trivial and is the main result of this paper . starting from a general hamiltonian",
    ", we show how to obtain the basic logical gates in an abstract context .",
    "then , using the same system as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show how these gates can be implemented in a physical set - up .",
    "we build all the logical gates needed for quantum computing : a complete set of single - qubit gates and a two - qubit gate exploiting the mutual inductance between two circuits next to each other .",
