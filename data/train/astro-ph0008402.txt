    "this unique origin has made it a particularly useful monitor of time - integrated factors of galactic evolution such as the product of particle fluxes and abundance of targets , since its production during the galactic epoch appears to be limited to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "recent studies of be in halo stars (  molaro et al .",
    "@xcite , boesgaard et al .",
    "@xcite ) have suggested that the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for its formation may be more complex than previously supposed ; the linearity observed in the trend [ be / h ] vs. [ fe / h]=log(a / h)@xmath4/log(a / h)@xmath5 can not be easily reproduced by spallation reactions between -particles and protons hitting cno in the ism .",
    "hence , the study of the evolution of be in the galaxy is an important constraint of galactic cosmic - ray ( gcr ) theory .",
    "the above  mentioned linearity , in fact , seems to support the idea that type  ii supernovae ( sn ) accelerate freshly synthesized c and o and subsequently fragment into be and b ( vangioni - flam et al .",
    "@xcite ) . new data , especially at low metallicities ( below [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath13.0 ) , are essential to distinguish between different hypotheses , like , for instance , the mass interval of the sn progenitor .",
    "although this linearity strongly suggests a galactic origin for be , some inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis models ( ibbn ) have shown to be able to produce beryllium abundances as high as log ( be / h )  =  @xmath113.00 ( kajino & boyd @xcite ; cf orito et al .",

    "thus , this hypothesis has not been fully discarded yet .    here , we report on our very recent attempt of measuring beryllium in two of the most metal - poor stars ever observed in the spectral region near the atmospheric cut - off , where the be lines fall ( around 3130   ) .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     several syntheses were run until the best match between computed and observed spectra was achieved .",
    "our best - fit syntheses were obtained with kurucz -enhanced (  [ /fe ]  =  + 0.4  dex ) model atmospheres , that also include the approximate overshooting .",
    "this choice was driven by the need of comparing in a consistent way our results with data available from the literature (  boesgaard et al .",
    "the difference in the beryllium abundances derived by using models computed without the approximate overshooting was found to be negligible ( on the order of  0.05  dex ) .",

    "once the effect of using higher effective temperatures and gravities ( compared to ryan et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) on metallicity is considered , the metallicities we determine are in very good agreement with those of ryan and collaborators .",
    "the main source of uncertainty affecting be measurements comes from the accuracy with which the surface gravity is known for the stars under investigation and from the uncertainty related to the placement of the continuum .",
    "the dependence of be on gravity is of the order of @xmath8  0.110.12  dex for a change in  of @xmath8  0.25 .",
    "an uncertainty of the order of 12% in the determination of the continuum translates into another @xmath8  0.10dex .",
    "altogether , these sum up to @xmath8  0.15  dex .",
    "however , inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig5]a tells us that @xmath8  0.15  dex may underestimate the total uncertainty to be associated with our measurements .",
    "therefore , we decided to adopt @xmath8  0.20  dex as our representative error bar .",
    "non - lte effects on be abundances have been discussed by chmielewski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , kiselman & carlsson ( @xcite ) and garca lpez et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "net nlte corrections for halo dwarfs and other low mass stars are small , thus they were not included in the final estimate of the uncertainties .    the only disagreement which emerged from the spectrum synthesis , common to both stars , concerns the abundance of chromium : the two lines present in this small spectral region can not be fitted simultaneously ( see fig .  [ fig3]a and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the solution of such disparity is beyond the scope of this contribution , but probably suggests some uncertainty in the -values of these two lines . in the most recent works on transition probabilities , the log ( ) value of the line at 3128.7    is given an accuracy of `` d '' ( 50% ) , and the redder line does not even appear ( cf nist , national institute of standards & technology ) . as a test , we changed ( lowered ) the -value of the bluer line by different amounts ( up to the allowed @xmath850% ) and increased the cr abundance up to 0.3  dex trying to find an optimal match .",
    "we were only partially successful in this exercise , having found a very good fit but for lp 81543 only ( see fig .  [ fig3]b ) .",
    "because of the lack of knowledge of the accuracy of the -value of the redder line ( 3132.06   ) , no conclusion can be drawn at this point .",
    "when the lines of interest are very weak , as in our case , the abundances inferred from the spectrum syntheses can be usually interpreted as just consistent with the observed data . in order to check the validity of our",
    "be detection , we applied cayrel s formula ( cayrel @xcite ) , which estimates the minimum equivalent width detectable of a line , given the resolution , pixel size and signal - to - noise ratio of the observed data . in the case of our best spectrum ( lp 81543 ) and adopting a fwhm  =  0.1078  m  and s / n  =  110 ( at 3130   ) , ew@xmath9(1@xmath10 )  =  0.6  m  is found .",
    "unfortunately , even for our best spectrum , it is very difficult to measure the equivalent width of the feature present at 3131.066   , that we think to be beryllium .",
    "our attempt gives ew  =  1.7  m , thus implying that we may be very close to a 3@xmath10 detection .",
    "however , this procedure is not satisfactory .",
    "following the referee s suggestion , we also tried to subtract the gaussian fit of the main features blending with the two lines , and then to fit the presumed lines .",
    "this should provide a further check on the wavelength of the lines .",
    "the test was indeed successful , and proved that the remaining lines fall exactly at 3130.421    and at 3131.066   , i.e. at the expected positions .",
    "however , we were not completely satisfied with this procedure either because the subtraction of the contribution due to the blending lines is a very delicate task ( especially in very metal - poor stars where the doublet is very weak and the blending features are still quite strong ) .",
    "a more compelling evidence that we have a detection in lp 81543 may come from inspecting fig .",
    "after having checked that the absorptions we attribute to beryllium in lp 81543 fall at the expected wavelengths , we tried to obtain a better estimate of the importance of the blending features .",
    "for this purpose , we ran two more syntheses : both of them were computed taking out all the features blending with the two lines , but one had our previously determined best - fit be abundance ( dotted line in the figure ) and the other had no beryllium ( dashed line ) , i.e. the beryllium abundance was lowered by a factor of 20 . in our opinion",
    ", this test shows that the blending features do not affect our determination of be in this star , and that the features we initially attributed to beryllium are indeed the beryllium doublet .",
    "the observed spectrum of cd@xmath12417504 has a lower s / n@xmath1180 , that makes the measurement of the equivalent width even more difficult and highly uncertain .",
    "the be abundance derived for this star from our spectrum synthesis ( [ be / h ]  =  @xmath113.39 ) should be strictly considered an upper limit only .",
    "an observing strategy optimized for beryllium would likely have provided a detection .",

    "our two new data points ( one detection , one upper limit ) suggest that be keeps decreasing as lower metallicities are probed , which is in support of a galactic production of beryllium and argues against a primordial ( big bang ) component ( although the latter can not be excluded yet ) .",
    "the correlation of be abundances with metallicity in the early galaxy ( boesgaard et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the finding of a b / be ratio equal to that predicted by spallation ( between 10 and 20 , e.g. duncan et al .",
    "@xcite ; garca lpez et al .",
    "@xcite ) have been usually considered a clear evidence for a galactic ( as opposed to primordial ) production mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , no b measurement is available for either of our two stars .",
    "this , together with the lack of be determinations in stars below a metallicity of 1/1000 solar has so far prevented us from testing the efficiency of cosmic - ray spallation versus any possible primordial be synthesis , as predicted by some big bang nucleosynthesis models that take into account inhomogeneities during the first few minutes after the big bang .",
    "the detection of a plateau in the relationship between [ be / h ] and [ o / h ] ( or [ be / h ] vs [ fe / h ] , although less stringent ) has usually been considered a possible evidence for such primordial abundance of be , although the level of such plateau has remained quite uncertain ( recent calculations , e.g. orito et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , predict @xmath12 n(be / h ) + 12  =  @xmath13.0 , thus below the abundances we have been able to detect so far ) .",
    "however , should a plateau be detected , the interpretation may not be straightforward .",
    "some of the theoretical scenarios recently proposed predict a be plateau below [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath13.0 that is not correlated with a primordial production of beryllium .",
    "yoshii et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that the finding of a be plateau at low metallicities may derive from accretion phenomena of interstellar matter .",
    "these authors analyze how the accretion of metal - enriched interstellar gas onto metal - poor halo stars , while crossing the galactic plane , may have affected the observed surface abundances of the light elements , beryllium and boron .",
    "[ fig6 ]    according to their scenario , a key parameter that may distinguish between a primordial production of beryllium and the accretion scenario is the b / be ratio ( independent of the accretion rate , but strongly dependent on the baryon density in low- and high - density regions ) .",
    "determinations of both be and b in the same stars and in the region of the plateau become then a high priority in order to fully test the accretion scenario . but",
    "a similar plateau may also be related to the progenitor mass of the exploding supernova .",
    "vangioni - flam et al . (",
    "@xcite ) proposed two possible different scenarios responsible for be production .",
    "if shock acceleration in the gaseous phase of superbubbles produced by collective sn  ii explosions is the main mechanism , then only the most massive stars ( with initial mass m @xmath13 60m@xmath14 ) can play a role because of their much shorter lifetimes .",
    "whereas , a much larger mass range ( m @xmath13 8m@xmath14 ) is involved if be production is due to acceleration of the debris of grains formed in the ejecta of ( in this case ) sn  ii .",
    "determining the [ be / fe ] ratio in very metal - poor objects is then the key not only to fully test the hypothesis of a possible big bang be production , but also to disentangle between the two other possibilities : in the first case [ be / fe ] is predicted to be enhanced at very early times , in the second case is constant .",
    "of course , in order to do that , several new accurate measurements are needed .",
    "as summarized in table  1 , cd@xmath12417504 was observed in different instrumental settings , thus a larger spectral coverage is available , including the region around the line at 6708   , which appears on both uves red settings ( red 580  nm and red 860  nm ) .",
    "the coadded spectrum of the region has a total s / n ratio of @xmath15 . due to its low metallicity",
    "the star plays a crucial role in connection to the possible presence of a dependence of the li abundance on metallicity in the spite plateau .    in the combined spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the ew of the li line is found to be ew  =  @xmath16 m , where the error bar was estimated with the cayrel formula ( cayrel 1988 ) . this value is consistent with the mean value obtained by measurements on the individual spectra ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "previous measurements in the literature show a wide scatter between @xmath18 m  ( ryan et al .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath19 m  ( spite & spite @xcite ) .",
    "the average of all the available measurements is in good agreement with our measurement .",
    "however , if we compare our result to the recent study of lithium by ryan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who adopt the value of @xmath20 , which is the mean of three measurements , we measure an ew which is larger by 2.5  m , though consistent at 1.7 @xmath10 .",
    "we computed the li abundances as described in bonifacio & molaro ( @xcite ) , from atlas9 no  overshooting , @xmath21 enhanced models and obtained a(li )  =  @xmath22 for  =  6300  k , and a(li )  =  @xmath23 for  =  @xmath24  k. by correcting the latter value ( in order to be consistent with the temperature scale used by bonifacio & molaro @xcite ) for the nlte effects , according to carlsson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we obtain a(li )  =  2.20 , which is in agreement , within errors , with the plateau level of @xmath25 derived by bonifacio & molaro ( @xcite ) using the same technique and irfm temperatures .",
    "thus our measure does not support the decrease of li abundance for lower metallicities as claimed by ryan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "although a full discussion of the slope on the spite plateau is beyond the scope of the present paper , we note the upwards revision of the ew which implies a li abundance 0.06  dex higher than the value derived by ryan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this slight increase would then bring the data point up again , closer to the average spite - plateau li value , weakening their claim for the existence of a slope . by performing ordinary least squares and bces fits to the ryan et al .",
    "data , increasing their li abundance for cd@xmath12417504 by 0.06 dex , we find that the slope decreases by @xmath11 19% .",
    "therefore the main effect remains the true effective temperature of this star and in general which is the `` best '' temperature scale for metal  poor stars .",
    "we have presented the analysis of two new high resolution and high s / n near - uv spectra , obtained during the commissioning of uves , with the main purpose of measuring be .",
    "we have detected be in lp 81543 ( [ be / h ]  =  @xmath113.09 , 99.7% confidence level ) , whereas an upper limit was found in the case of cd@xmath124@xmath2617504 ( [ be / h ]  @xmath27  13.39 ) .",
    "we have also measured lithium in cd@xmath124@xmath2617504 , and found to be a(li )  =  2.20 , in good agreement with the spite - plateau level .",
    "these new observations clearly show the potential of the new eso vlt high resolution echelle spectrograph uves , especially in the near - uv spectral range .",
    "its ( now measured ) efficiency at 3130    ( where the doublet falls ) is a factor of 3 to 4 higher than the combination of keck  i and hires .",
    "new accurate measurements in a large sample of targets are foreseen in the near future and will have an important impact on our knowledge of galactic cosmic - ray spallation .",
