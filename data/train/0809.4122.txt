    "gravitational lensing has become one of important subjects in modern astronomy and cosmology ( e.g. , schneider 2006 , weinberg 2008 ) .",
    "it has many applications as gravitational telescopes in various fields ranging from extra - solar planets to dark matter and dark energy at cosmological scales .",
    "this paper focuses on gravitational lensing due to a n - point mass system .",
    "indeed it is a challenging problem to express the image positions as functions of lens and source parameters .",
    "there are several motivations .",
    "one is that gravitational lensing offers a tool of discoveries and measurements of planetary systems ( schneider and weiss 1986 , mao and paczynski 1991 , gould and loeb 1992 , bond et al .",
    "2004 , beaulieu et al .",
    "2006 ) , compact stars , or a cluster of dark objects , which are difficult to probe with other methods .",
    "gaudi et al . (",
    "2008 ) have recently found an analogy of the sun - jupiter - saturn system by lensing .",
    "another motivation is theoretically oriented .",
    "one may be tempted to pursue a transit between a particle method and a fluid ( mean field ) one . for microlensing studies ,",
    "particle methods are employed , because the systems consist of stars , planets or machos . in cosmological lensing , on the other hand , light propagation is considered for the gravitational field produced by inhomogeneities of cosmic fluids , say galaxies or large scale structures of the universe ( e.g. , refregier 2003 for a review ) .",
    "it seems natural , though no explicit proof has been given , that observed quantities computed by continuum fluid methods will agree with those by discrete particle ones in the limit @xmath0 , at least on average , where @xmath1 is the number of particles .",
    "related with the problems mentioned above , we should note an astronomically important effect caused by the finiteness of @xmath1 .",
    "for most of cosmological gravitational lenses ( both of strong and weak ones ) , a continuum approximation can be safe and has worked well .",
    "there exists an exceptional case , however , for which discreteness becomes important .",
    "one example is a quasar microlensing due to a point - like lens object , which is possibly a star in a host galaxy ( for an extensive review , wambsganss 2006 ) .",
    "a galaxy consists of very large number @xmath1 particles , and light rays from an object at cosmological distance may have a chance to pass very near one of the point masses . as a consequence of finite-@xmath1 effect in large @xmath1 point lenses , anomalous changes in the light curve",
    "are observed .",
    "for such a quasar microlensing , hybrid approaches are usually employed , where particles are located in a smooth gravitational field representing a host galaxy .",
    "it is thus likely that @xmath1 point - mass approach will be useful also when we study such a finite-@xmath1 effect at a certain transit stage between a particles system and a smooth one .",
    "along this course , an ( 2007 ) investigated a @xmath1 point lens model , which represents a very special configuration that every point masses are located on regular grid points .    for a @xmath1 point - mass lens at a general configuration ,",
    "very few things are known in spite of many efforts . among known ones",
    "is the maximum number of images lensed by @xmath1 point masses . after direct calculations by witt ( 1990 ) and mao",
    ", petters and witt ( 1997 ) , a careful study by rhie ( 2001 for n=4 , 2003 for general n ) revealed that it is possible to obtain the maximum number of images as @xmath2 .",
    "this theorem for polynomials has been extended to a more general case including rational functions by khavinson and neumann ( 2006 ) .",
    "( see khavinson and neumann 2008 for an elegant review on a connection between the gravitational lens theory and the algebra , especially the fundamental theorem of algebra , and its extension to rational functions ) .    * theorem * ( khavinson and neumann 2006 ) : + let @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are relatively prime polynomials in @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 be the degree of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 , then the number of zeros for @xmath10 . here ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath11 denote a complex number and its complex conjugate , respectively .",
    "furthermore , bayer , dyer and giang ( 2006 ) showed that in a configuration of point masses , replacing one of the point deflectors by a spherically symmetric distributed mass only introduces one extra image .",
    "hence they found that the maximum number of images due to @xmath1 distributed lensing objects located on a plane is @xmath12 .",
    "global properties such as lower bounds on the number of images are also discussed in petters , levine and wambsganss ( 2001 ) and references therein .    in spite of many efforts on @xmath1 lensing objects , functions for image positions",
    "are still unknown even for @xmath1 point - mass lenses in a general configuration under the thin lens approximation .",
    "hence it is a challenging problem to express the image positions as functions of lens and source locations .",
    "once such an expression is known , one can immediately obtain magnifications via computing the jacobian of the lens mapping ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) .    only for a very few cases such as a single point mass and a singular isothermal ellipsoid ,",
    "the lens equation can be solved by hand and image positions are known , because the lens equation becomes a quadratic or fourth - order one ( for a singular isothermal ellipsoid , asada et al .",
    "for the binary lens system , the lens equation has the degree of five in a complex variable ( witt 1990 ) .",
    "it has the same degree also in a real variable ( asada 2002a , asada et al .",
    "this improvement is not trivial because a complex variable brings two degrees of freedom",
    ". this single - real - variable polynomial has advantages .",
    "for instance , the number of real roots ( with vanishing imaginary parts ) corresponds to that of lensed images .",
    "the analytic expression of the caustic , where the number of images changes , is obtained by the fifth - order polynomial ( asada et al .",
    "galois showed , however , that the fifth - order and higher polynomials can not be solved algebraically ( van der waerden 1966 ) .",
    "hence , no formula for the quintic equation is known . for this reason",
    ", some numerical implementation is required to find out image positions ( and magnifications ) for the binary gravitational lens for a general position of the source . only for special cases of the source at a symmetric location such as on - axis sources ,",
    "the lens equation can be solved by hand and image positions are thus known ( schneider and weiss 1986 ) . for a weak field region ,",
    "some perturbative solutions for the binary lens have been found ( bozza 1999 , asada 2002b ) , for instance in order to discuss astrometric lensing , which is caused by the image centroid shifts ( for a single mass , miyamoto and yoshii 1995 , walker 1995 ; for a binary lens , safizadeh et al .",
    "1999 , jeong et al . 1999 ,",
    "asada 2002b ) .",
    "if the number of point masses @xmath1 is larger than two , the basic equation is much more highly non - linear so that the lens equation can be solved only by numerical methods . as a result",
    ", observational properties such as magnifications and image separations have been investigated so far numerically for @xmath1 point - mass lenses .",
    "this makes it difficult to investigate the dependence of observational quantities on lens parameters .",
    "this paper is the first attempt to seek an analytic expression of image positions without assuming any special symmetry . for this purpose",
    ", we shall present a method of taylor - series expansion to solve the lens equation for @xmath1 point - mass lens systems .",
    "our method allows a systematic iterative analysis as shown later .    under three assumptions of weak gravitational fields , thin lenses and small deflection angles ,",
    "gravitational lensing is usually described as a mapping from the lens plane onto the source plane ( schneider et al .",
    "bourassa and kantowski ( 1973 , 1975 ) introduced a complex notation to describe gravitational lensing .",
    "their notation was exclusively used to describe lenses with elliptical or spheroidal symmetry ( borgeest 1983 , bray 1984 , schramm 1990 ) . for @xmath1 point lenses , witt ( 1990 ) succeeded in recasting the lens equation into a single - complex - variable polynomial .",
    "this is in an elegant form and thus has been often used in investigations of point - mass lenses .",
    "an advantage in the single - complex - variable formulation is that we can use some mathematical tools applicable to complex - analytic functions , especially polynomials ( witt 1993 , witt and petters 1993 , witt and mao 1995 ) .",
    "one tool is the fundamental theorem of algebra : every non - constant single - variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root .",
    "this is also stated as : every non - zero single - variable polynomial , with complex coefficients , has exactly as many complex roots as its degree , if each root is counted as many times as its multiplicity . on the other hand , in the original form of the lens equation , one can hardly count up the number of images because of non - linearly coupled properties . this theorem , therefore , raises a problem in gravitational lensing .",
    "the single - variable polynomial due to @xmath1 point lenses has the degree of @xmath13 , though the maximum number of images is @xmath2 .",
    "this means that unphysical roots are included in the polynomial ( for detailed discussions on the disappearance and appearance of images near fold and cusp caustics for general lens systems , see also petters , levine and wambsganss ( 2001 ) and references therein ) .",
    "first , we thus investigate explicitly behaviors of roots for the polynomial lens equation from the viewpoint of perturbations .",
    "we shall identify unphysical roots .",
    "secondly , we shall re - examine the lens equation , so that the appearance of unphysical roots can be avoided .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", the complex description of gravitational lensing is briefly summarised .",
    "the lens equation is embedded into a single - complex - variable polynomial in section 3 .",
    "perturbative roots for the complex polynomial are presented for binary and triple systems in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "they are extended to a case of @xmath1 point lenses in section 6 . in section 7",
    ", we re - examine the lens equation in a dual - complex - variables formalism and its perturbation scheme for a binary lens for its simplicity .",
    "the perturbation scheme is extended to a @xmath1 point lens system in section 8 .",
    "section 9 is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "we consider a lens system with n point masses .",
    "the mass and two - dimensional location of each body is denoted as @xmath14 and the vector @xmath15 , respectively . for the later convenience ,",
    "let us define the angular size of the einstein ring as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant , @xmath18 is the light speed , @xmath19 is the total mass @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote distances between the observer and the lens , between the observer and the source , and between the lens and the source , respectively . in the unit normalised by the angular size of the einstein ring ,",
    "the lens equation becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the vectors for the position of the source and image , respectively and we defined the mass ratio and the angular separation vector as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    in a formalism based on complex variables , two - dimensional vectors for the source , lens and image positions",
    "are denoted as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively ( see also fig .",
    "@xmath32 ) . by employing this formalism ,",
    "the lens equation is rewritten as @xmath33 where the asterisk @xmath34 means the complex conjugate .",
    "the lens equation is non - analytic because it contains both @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "( the circle ) and @xmath6 ( the filled disk ) , respectively .",
    "locations of n point masses are denoted by @xmath35 ( filled triangles ) for @xmath36 . here , we assume the thin lens approximation . ,",
    "the complex conjugate of eq .",
    "( @xmath37 ) is expressed as @xmath38 this expression can be substituted into @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( @xmath37 ) to eliminate the complex variable @xmath11 . as a result",
    ", we obtain a @xmath39-th order analytic polynomial equation as ( witt 1990 ) @xmath40 equation ( a3 ) in witt ( 1990 ) takes a rather complicated form because of inclusion of nonzero shear @xmath41 due to surrounding matter .",
    "bayer et al . ( 2006 ) uses a complex formalism in order to discuss the maximum number of images in a configuration of point masses , by replacing one of point deflectors by a spherically symmetric distributed mass .",
    "their lens equation ( 3 ) agrees with eq .",
    "( @xmath42 ) . in order to show this agreement",
    ", one may use @xmath43 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that eq .",
    "@xmath44 contains not only all the solutions for the lens equation @xmath45 but also unphysical false roots which do not satisfy eq .",
    "@xmath45 , in price of the manipulation for obtaining an analytic polynomial equation , as already pointed out by rhie ( 2001 , 2003 ) and bayer et al .",
    "such an inclusion of unphysical solutions can be easily understood by remembering that we get unphysical roots as well as true ones if one takes a square of an equation including the square root .",
    "in fact , an analogous thing happens in another example of gravitational lenses such as an isothermal ellipsoidal lens as a simple model of galaxies ( asada et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in general , the mass ratio @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 , so that it can be taken as an expansion parameter . without loss of generality , we can assume that the first lens object is the most massive , namely @xmath48 for @xmath49 . thus , formal solutions are expressed in taylor series as @xmath50 where the coefficients @xmath51 are independent of @xmath46 .    up to this point",
    ", the origin of the lens plane is arbitrary . in the following ,",
    "the origin of the lens plane is chosen as the location of the mass @xmath52 , such that one can put @xmath53 .",
    "this enables us to simplify some expressions and to easily understand their physical meanings , mostly because gravity is dominated by @xmath52 in most regions except for the vicinity of @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "namely , it is natural to treat our problem as perturbations around a single lens by @xmath52 ( located at the origin of the coordinates ) .    in numerical simulations or practical data",
    "analysis , however , one may use the coordinates in which the origin is not the location of @xmath52 .",
    "if one wishes to consider such a case of @xmath56 , one could make a translation by @xmath57 as @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 in our perturbative solutions that are given below .",
    "in this section , we investigate binary lenses explicitly up to the third order .",
    "this simple example may help us to understand the structure of the perturbative solutions .",
    "for an arbitrary @xmath1 case , expressions of iterative solutions are quite formal ( see below ) .      in powers of @xmath65 ,",
    "the polynomial equation is rewritten as @xmath66 where we defined @xmath67   ( w^ * z^2-w w^ * z - w ) , \\nonumber\\\\ f_1(z)&=&(z - w )   \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times   % \\left ( \\bigl ( \\epsilon ( z - w ) [ ( 2w^*-\\epsilon^*)z+2 ]   % \\nonumber\\\\ % & & -\\epsilon^ * z^2 ( z-\\epsilon ) - \\epsilon z   \\bigr ) ,   % \\right ) ,   \\nonumber\\\\ f_2(z)&=&\\epsilon^2 ( z - w ) .",
    "\\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        at @xmath69 , the lens equation becomes the fifth - order polynomial equation as @xmath70 .",
    "zeroth order solutions are obtained by solving this .",
    "all the solutions are @xmath64 ( doublet ) , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where we defined @xmath73 one of the roots , @xmath71 , is unphysical , because it does not satisfy eq .",
    "@xmath45 at @xmath69 . by using all the 0th order roots including unphysical ones , @xmath74 is factorised as @xmath75      next , we seek @xmath76st - order roots .",
    "we put @xmath77 . at the linear order in @xmath65 , eq .",
    "( @xmath42 ) becomes @xmath78 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "thereby we obtain a @xmath76st - order root as @xmath79 the similar manner can not be applied to a case of @xmath64 , because it is a doublet root with @xmath80 , while @xmath81 . at @xmath82 ,",
