    "studies of solar magnetism have provided us with fantastic spatial ( i.e. , enabling us to resolve small - scale structure of the solar magnetic fields ) and temporal ( with cadences reaching less than a minute ) resolutions .",
    "studying magnetism in stars , although more observationally challenging , is equally rewarding .",
    "in particular , imaging the magnetic field of solar - type stars , despite being less detailed , allow us to put the sun in a much more general context .",
    "solar observations have revealed a multitude of details of the solar photospheric magnetic field . although observations have not yet fully resolved all the solar magnetic structures , these structures are seen in a wide dynamical range : small - scale structures organised into ephemeral regions , network features and internetwork features ( as small as a few @xmath5  km , @xcite ) form the magnetic carpet of the quiet sun . as the sun moves towards increasing activity in its cycle , sunspots start to show up more frequently in the solar photosphere .",
    "sunsposts appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity and group together , forming active regions that are then distributed at low latitudes over the solar surface .",
    "the stellar counterparts to the solar small - sized magnetic features are currently not resolved in images of stellar magnetism .",
    "the main technique used to image stellar surface magnetic field is the zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi ) technique .",
    "this technique consists of analysing a series of circularly polarised spectra ( stokes v ) to recover information about the large - scale magnetic topology , including its intensity , orientation and how this field is distributed over the stellar surface . in practice ,",
    "the star is observed during several rotation cycles .",
    "then , the time - series of high - resolution stokes v profiles is inverted into a surface magnetic map .",
    "zdi studies have demonstrated that cool dwarf stars harbour at their surfaces large - scale magnetic fields with a wide variety of intensities and topologies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the zdi technique is able to reconstruct the topology ( polarity and orientation ) of the stellar magnetic field through the stellar surface .",
    "however , these images have much lower resolution than solar magnetic field maps due to several factors , such as the temporal sampling of the observations , their achieved signal - to - noise ratio , the intrinsic width of the ( local ) stellar line profile and the resolution of observations .",
    "regarding the latter , magnetic fields of different polarities within an angular resolution element cancel each other out . as a result",
    ", small - scale structures can not be seen by zdi , which instead is able to map only the large - scale magnetic field @xcite .",
    "synoptic maps of vector magnetic fields are one of the outputs of the zdi technique . through its spectropolarimetric monitoring during several stellar rotation cycles",
    ", zdi can reconstruct the surface large - scale vector field in its three components : radial @xmath6 , meridional @xmath7 ( north - south ) and azimuthal @xmath8 ( east - west ) components ( figure [ fig.magmap ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , and in spite of the significant advances in solar observations for over half a decade , only the strength and the line - of - sight ( los ) component of the solar magnetic field have been systematically measured .",
    "vector magnetic fields at the photosphere are available , but mainly for localised small areas of the solar surface ( e.g. , active regions @xcite ) .",
    "full - disk vector magnetograms , which are required to create synoptic maps of the vector solar field , have just recently started to be measured with the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi , @xcite ) at the solar dynamics observatory and by the synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun ( solis @xcite ) at the national solar observatory .",
    "the global capabilities of these instruments will provide us a unique opportunity to observe the large - scale spatial distribution of vector magnetic fields across the solar surface @xcite .    although synoptic maps of the stellar vector field exist for a couple of decades and",
    "have been derived for hundreds of systems , there are significantly fewer synoptic maps of the vector field of the sun",
    ". earlier synoptic maps of the vector solar field were created on the basis of the rotational modulation of los magnetograms ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also called  pseudo - vector reconstruction method  ) . with this method",
    ", these authors assumed that the field on large spatial scales does not change over several days . because of this assumption , these early synoptic maps reconstructed only large - scale magnetic fields of the sun .",
    "more recently , @xcite used daily full - disk vector magnetograms from the solis / vsm spectrograph to reconstruct the vector solar field of a series of 23 carrington rotations .",
    "this is a significant advance compared to the large majority of synoptic charts of the solar magnetic field , which are restricted to the los component of the solar magnetic field , used to derive @xmath6 .",
    "an important conclusion reached by @xcite is that the solar magnetic field is not normal ( i.e. , purely radial ) to the surface at the photospheric level .",
    "this is somewhat disturbing , as the assumption that the solar magnetic fields are purely radial are used in several studies .    with the new existing capabilities in producing vector synoptic fields",
    ", we can now start to investigate the behaviour of the meridional @xmath7 and azimuthal @xmath8 components of the solar magnetic field and investigate how the three magnetic field components in the sun compare to the ones derived in stellar observations ( e.g. , figure [ fig.magmap ] ) .",
    "however , direct comparison between stellar and solar magnetic field topologies are hampered by their dramatic differences in resolutions . to provide a direct comparison between solar and stellar magnetic field synoptic maps ,",
    "it is first required to ` filter out ' the small - scale field ( i.e. , the finely resolved magnetic features ) of the solar observations , since this component is currently not accessible to zdi studies . after this , we are left with only the solar large - scale field , whose spatial scale is comparable to those achieved by stellar observations .",
    "one way to filter out the small - scale structure of the solar field is to express the solar magnetic field as spherical harmonics of different @xmath0 degrees , up to a maximum degree @xmath9 .",
    "the smallest @xmath0 degrees represent the largest - scale components , e.g. , @xmath10 for the dipole , @xmath11 for the quadrupole , @xmath12 for the octupole and so on . by retaining only the components of low @xmath0 degrees in the spherical harmonics decomposition ,",
    "we are then able to calculate the large - scale component of the magnetic map .",
    "this approach has been extensively applied to the los and radial components of the solar field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the choice of @xmath9 is related to the spatial resolution of the maps . in high - resolution solar synoptic maps , @xmath13 @xcite , while in stellar synoptic maps , @xmath14 @xcite , quantitatively demonstrating the large - scale nature of the currently available zdi measurements . in the map shown in figure [ fig.magmap ] , for example , @xmath15 @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a mathematical description of the solar magnetic field using spherical harmonics is currently only available for its radial component , limiting us to draw analogies between solar and stellar fields _ only _ for the radial large - scale magnetic field component . in this paper",
    ", we extend the currently available mathematical description of @xmath6 to @xmath7 and @xmath8 components .",
    "our description is entirely consistent with the description adopted in several zdi studies making it straightforward to compare the large - scale magnetic field vector of the sun at the same resolution of stellar studies . in practice , with the set of equations we derive in the present study",
    ", one will be able to derive the spherical harmonics coefficients from a synoptic map of the vector field ( either from solar observations or synthesised in numerical simulations of dynamo and magnetic flux transport studies ) , filter out the large @xmath0-degrees ( i.e. , keeping the degrees that represent the large - scale field ) and reconstruct only the large - scale field component .",
    "alternatively , by filtering out the small @xmath0-degrees ( i.e. , keeping the degrees that represent the small - scale field ) , one can also study the small - scale field distribution .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : section [ sec.mathematical ] presents the method we use to decompose the magnetic field vector using spherical harmonics and its inversion . section",

    "the non - radial nature of the photospheric solar magnetic field was already shown by @xcite and here we demonstrated that the large - scale field of the sun is not purely radial either . by converting the vector field from spherical coordinates ( which are easy to visualise ) to poloidal and toroidal components ( the ones most often quoted in papers and the ones predicted by dynamo theories ) , we showed that the solar magnetic energy at cr2109 is mainly ( @xmath4 ) poloidal ( figure [ fig.histogram_poltor ] ) .    another way to separate large- and small - scale fields",
    "is by segregating weak and strong field regions ( associated with the large- and small scale fields , respectively ) using a cut - off criterion in the magnetic field strength .",
    "this has been adopted in several studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , who considered the strong radial fields to have @xmath124  g and weak fields to have @xmath125 .",
    "these approaches have the advantage of being straightforward and do not require long mathematical derivations such as the ones we presented here .",
    "the downside of approaches that use a cut - off in field strength is that they do not ensure the connectivity between the three magnetic components .",
    "for example , a region with @xmath124  g does not necessarily have @xmath126 or @xmath127  g ; if the same cut - off threshold is used for the three components , the strong fields in the radial , meridional and azimuthal components might not be connected to the same spatial region in the star .",
    "in addition , each point in the solar photosphere is likely to be composed of fields with different scales , which together add up to the observed value .",
    "therefore , one can not associate regions with , e.g. , @xmath124  g to be formed of small - scale fields solely , as an underlying large - scale field is likely to be present . for this reason",
    ", we consider the use of the method presented here to provide a more reliable way to recover the solar large - scale magnetic field in its three components .",
    "it is also interesting to study the variation of the observed azimuthal and meridional field components , as well as the toroidal / poloidal configurations , along the 22-yr solar cycle .",
    "unfortunately , so far , the solar synoptic maps of the vector field are only available for carrignton rotations cr2109 to 2131 covering a period of less than 2 years ( from 2011 march to 2012 december , @xcite ) .",
    "we defer this study for the future , when large time baselines shall become available .",
    "the synoptic map used in section [ sec.application ] was acquired by solis instruments operated by nisp / nso / aura / nsf .",
