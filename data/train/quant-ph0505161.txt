    "efficient simulation of quantum dynamics on classical computers is hampered by the problem of scaling : the complexity of computation in quantum dynamics scales exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the reason for this exponential growth is the entanglement of the degrees of freedom that is generated during the evolution .",
    "this problem is of a fundamental character : entanglement is viewed as one of the main peculiarities of the quantum dynamics as compared to its classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "asking under what conditions entanglement is generated along the evolution of the quantum system is closely associated with the question of the quantum - classical transition @xcite .",
    "it is customary in quantum dynamical simulations to assume that the initial state of the composite system is factorized in the relevant local basis @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether the product form is conserved along the evolution @xcite .",
    "the answer was generally found to be negative both for the pure @xcite and for the mixed state @xcite dynamics .",
    "a pure composite state is entangled if and only if it is not factorized in the local basis . for mixed states",
    "the situation is more complex @xcite . for a bipartite composite system separability @xcite",
    "is defined as a decomposition of the density matrix of the composite system in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are density matrices on hilbert spaces of the first and the second subsystem , respectively .",
    "separable states exhibit only classical correlations .",
    "states that can not be represented in the form ( [ separability ] ) exhibit correlations that can not be explained within any classical theory and are said to be entangled .",
    "there are two qualitatively different kinds of the mixed states entanglement @xcite : free entanglement and bound entanglement .",
    "free entanglement can be brought in a form useful for quantum information processing and bound entanglement is `` useless '' in this sense .",
    "separable states are not of the product form generally . thus the important question remains , under what conditions the mixed state of the composite system evolving from the initial product ( or generally separable ) state develops entanglement along the evolution .",
    "if quantum correlations in the composite system do not develop during the evolution one may speculate that the dynamics of the composite system has classical character .",
    "a possible practical implication is that this `` separable dynamics '' could be simulated efficiently on classical computers .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement was investigated recently in various systems : the quantum brownian particle @xcite , harmonic chain @xcite , two - qubits system interacting with the common harmonic bath @xcite , jaynes - cummings model @xcite , nmr @xcite , various spin systems @xcite , morse oscillator coupled to the spin bath @xcite and bipartite gaussian states in quantum optics @xcite to mention just some cases .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore the temperature dependence of entanglement generation in the course of evolution of a bipartite state in the limit of weak coupling and nonresonant interaction between the parts . under these limitations",
    "nondegenerate perturbation theory was applied to the calculation of the bipartite entanglement in the evolving composite system .",
    "we have considered two cases of interaction - ( 1 ) direct interaction , when two initially disentangled systems are brought into contact ( cf .",
    "fig.[scheme:1 ] ) , and ( 2 ) indirect interaction , when two noninteracting and initially disentangled systems are brought into contact with the third party ( cf .",

    "the initial state of the composite system was taken to be the product of the thermal states of the parts .    to establish quantum entanglement the peres - horodeckii criterion",
    "is employed @xcite .",
    "the peres - horodeckii criterion states that the bipartite system is entangled when the partially transposed density matrix of the system possesses a negative eigenvalue .",
    "the converse statement is generally not true : there exist inseparable states whose partially transposes are positive @xcite .",
    "it is proved in ref.@xcite that states whose partially transposes are positive ( ppt states in what follows ) do not exhibit free entanglement",
    ". therefore ppt states are either separable or bound entangled and as a consequence are not useful in quantum information processing . in the context of simulating a quantum composite system with classical computers , we are interested in the possibility of maintaining a separable form ( cf .",
    "eq.([separability ] ) ) during the evolution .",
    "we conjecture on the basis of ref.@xcite , where it is proved that ppt density matrices of sufficiently small rank are separable , that for a state that remains ppt during the evolution separability can be obtained by embedding in a larger hilbert space .    applying the peres - horodeckii criterion to the case ( 1 )",
    "we show that for sufficiently low initial temperature of the subsystems the interaction does induce entanglement unless the ground state of either one of the subsystem is invariant under the interaction . a lower and upper critical temperatures",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath0 exist such that if the composite system evolves from the initial thermal state with temperature @xmath10 the minimal eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix becomes negative in the course of the evolution and if @xmath11 the minimal eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix stays positive .",
    "the lower bound @xmath2 of the lower critical temperatures @xmath3 was calculated in the limit of weak intersystem coupling and shown to be tight : the negativity of the composite state @xcite , which is a quantitative counterpart of the peres - horodeckii criterion and a measure of entanglement , is shown to be generally negligible for temperatures in the interval @xmath4 . therefore , according to the peres - horodeckii criterion , when @xmath12 the composite system develops entanglement in the course of the evolution and when @xmath13 the composite state remains ppt state .",
    "the question addressed in case ( 2 ) of indirect coupling is what are the conditions on the interaction with the common bath and on the initial temperature of the states which cause entanglement of the noninteracting systems ?",
    "two scenarios with time scales separation are studied : ( a ) two `` slow '' noninteracting systems coupled to a `` fast '' third party ( b ) two `` fast '' noninteracting systems coupled to `` slow '' third party . under some technical assumptions about the form of the interaction we find in both cases that for sufficiently low initial temperature of the noninteracting systems entanglement is induced by the interaction with the third party .",
    "we calculate the lower bound temperature @xmath2 in both cases of the time scales separation . in the system of two noninteracting spins ,",
    "coupled to the common bath , the lower bound coincides with the @xmath0 .    in both cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 )",
    "the evolution starts from an uncorrelated initial state of the composite system represented by the tensor product of thermal states of the subsystems involved . as a consequence , initially the eigenstates of the partially transposed density matrix of the composite state are nonnegative .",
    "the evolution under the interaction perturbs the initial state .",
    "the new eigenvalues of the partially transposed density matrix are calculated by the nondegenerate perturbation theory assuming the coupling is weak and the interaction is nonresonanant . the time dependence of the minimal eigenvalue is not analyzed in detail . as the time evolution of the density matrix is quasiperiodic the minimal eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix is also a quasiperiodic function of time .",

    "the negativity of the partially transposed composite state is zero in the leading order in the coupling strength and therefore negligible in the weak coupling limit .",
    "it follows , that @xmath2 may be considered as the _ physical _ critical temperature for the negativity of the composite state .",
    "separable states can be considered as classical states , because they lack quantum correlations .",
    "one may hope that , as a consequence , the dynamics of separable states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers . whether this is possible",
    "is an open question in quantum information science .",
    "if a moderate scaling procedure exists for the simulation of the dynamics of a separable bipartite state , then it seems that such a procedure exists also if the evolving state remains ppt for all times .",
    "ref.@xcite has proved that a density operator @xmath30 supported on a @xmath288 dimensional hilbert space ( @xmath289 ) with positive partial transpose and a rank smaller than or equal to @xmath290 is separable .",
    "it follows that a ppt state of dimension @xmath290 is always separable when embedded in the larger hilbert space of dimension @xmath291 or higher .",
    "the dynamics of the low dimensional ppt state will be physically equivalent to the dynamics of the high dimensional separable state which can ( hopefully ) be simulated efficiently on the classical computer .",
    "the present analysis shows that above a critical temperature @xmath2 the ppt character of a composite state is preserved along the evolution .",
