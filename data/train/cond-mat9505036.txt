    "recently a very interesting stochastic model with deposition and evaporation processes has been introduced by barma _ et .",
    "_ @xcite . in this model one",
    "deposits atoms on to @xmath4 adjacent vacant sites of a @xmath5-dimensional lattice and evaporates atoms from any @xmath4 adjacent occupied sites , with specific rates for deposition and evaporation .",
    "the cases @xmath6 and @xmath7 are exactly solvable , the former being trivial , and the latter being equivalent to ferromagnetic heisenberg spin-@xmath8 chain . for @xmath9 , on a linear chain of length @xmath10 , the phase space of this @xmath4-mer model consisting of the @xmath11 possible configurations is found to break up into an exponentially large number of dynamically disconnected sectors @xcite . this may be understood as being due to the existence of an infinite number of independent conserved quantities in this model @xcite .",
    "these conservation laws also give rise to a wide range of relaxation behavior @xcite .",
    "for example the density - density autocorrelation function shows different power law decays in different sectors ( @xmath12 ) and even a stretched exponential decay in some sectors .    for @xmath9 ,",
    "though there exist an infinite number of constants of motion , these still have not enabled us to get a full solution of the model so far . in this case",
    "the number of sectors and their sizes in the steady state has been calculated exactly , but the dynamics is understood only qualitatively .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian corresponding to the stochastic matrix has @xmath4-body interaction terms which makes the problem difficult to tackle analytically .",
    "thus it is worthwhile studying models which show the same qualitative features and are at the same time more tractable analytically .    with this motivation",
    "we define a variant of the @xmath4-mer deposition - evaporation model with @xmath13 states per site .",
    "this model for @xmath14 corresponds to the dimer deposition evaporation model studied by barma _",
    "et.al_. for @xmath15 this model shares many qualitative features with the trimer model , like the existence of an infinity of conservation laws encoded as the conservation law of the `` irreducible string '' @xcite , and different power law decay of the autocorrelation function in different sectors .",
    "however our model has the two advantages : it has only @xmath16-body interaction and it has an additional discrete symmetry group of very large order .",
    "these properties make this model more tractable analytically than the @xmath4-mer model .",
    "in fact , one can get many exact eigenvectors of the stochastic matrix in our model very easily .",
    "however , we have not succeeded so far in solving this model completely . for simplicity",
    "we study only @xmath17 case in this paper , for higher @xmath13 results will be qualitatively the same .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath16 we define our model and write the stochastic evolution operator in the form of the hamiltonian of a quantum many - body system of @xmath18 species of particles . in section",
    "@xmath18 we show that the vector space consisting of @xmath19 configurations breaks up into an exponentially large number of dynamically disconnected sectors , and also calculate their sizes . in section",
    "@xmath20 we describe the additional symmetries of this model and study the resulting further decomposition of the phase space formed by all the configurations belonging to a sector into subspaces .",
    "we construct a class of exact eigenvectors in the next section . in section",
    "@xmath21 we study the decay of autocorrelation function in various sectors . as in the case of trimer model @xcite",
    ", we find sector dependent decay .",
    "the spatial correlation function in the steady state for the sector corresponding to an initial condition of all sites in the same state is calculated in section @xmath22 .",
    "it has power law decay with exponent @xmath2 .",
    "a numerical diagonalization study of the stochastic matrix to find the dynamical exponent in this sector is presented in section @xmath23 .",
    "our model is defined as follows : at each site of a one dimensional lattice , there is a spin variable @xmath24 which can be in any of the three states @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "these spin variables undergo a stochastic time evolution given by the following rule : any pair of adjacent spins , which are in the same state , can flip together to any of the other two states with some specified rates for the transitions . for example",
    "an @xmath27 pair can flip to become either a @xmath28 pair or a @xmath29 pair .",
    "this process can be thought of as the evaporation of a @xmath27 dimer and immediate deposition of a @xmath28 or @xmath29 dimer at that place .",
    "we shall call this model the dimer deposition - evaporation model ( dde model ) .",
    "this is a special case of the general reaction - diffusion process ( @xmath30 ) recently studied by dahmen @xcite .",
    "we consider only the case of equal rates for all the transitions in this paper .",
    "any configuration @xmath31 on the lattice can be represented by the basis vector @xmath32 , in a vector space of dimension @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath33 denote the probability of the configuration @xmath31 at time @xmath1 , then the master equation describing the evolution of these probabilities can be written as = w + where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the stochastic matrix .",
    "we can write @xmath35 in the form of a quantum hamiltonian as follows .",
    "consider a quantum mechanical system of 3 species of particles on a one dimensional lattice of length @xmath10 with periodic boundary condition .",
    "each species is characterized by a color @xmath13 which can be either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "particles of the same colour experience a hard core interaction so that not more than one particle of the same color can occupy a given site .",
    "therefor every site can be either empty or occupied by up to @xmath18 particles of different colors .",
    "thus there are @xmath23 possible states on every site .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the pauli operators which annihilate and create a particle of color @xmath13 at the site @xmath38 . now consider the hamiltonian h = _",
    "i=1^l a_i , i+1 + b_i , i+1 + c_i , i+1 [ hami ] where @xmath39 where the operator @xmath40 acting on any state results a nonnull vector only when @xmath41 and is given by , a_i , i+1 = + - 2 [ action ] the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 have similar actions .",
    "the operator n_i",
    "= a_i^+a_i + b_i^+b_i + c_i^+c_i counts the number of particles at site @xmath38 . clearly = 0 , and the number of particles is conserved at each site .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the subspace of the full hilbert space in which there is only one particle at every site , _ ie .",
    "_ @xmath44 for all @xmath38 , corresponding to every configuration @xmath45 in this subspace there is a unique configuration specified by the same l - string in the dimer problem .",
    "the action of @xmath46 on @xmath47 is the same as that of @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath35 is represented by the quantum hamiltonian given by ( [ hami ] ) acting on the subspace with @xmath44 for all @xmath38 .",
    "make the particle - hole transformation ( @xmath48 ) on all odd numbered sites for all @xmath13 .",
    "we define the current operator by j_i , i+1 = a_i^+ a_i+1 + b_i^+ b_i+1 + c_i^+ c_i+1 .",
    "then the hamiltonian up to the addition of a constant can be written as h = _",
    "i j_2i,2i+1 j_2i,2i+1^+ + j_2i,2i-1 j_2i,2i-1^+ + 3 _ i , n_i , n_i+1 , .",
    "the dimer model now correspond to @xmath46 operating on a sector where @xmath44 for all even numbered sites and @xmath49 for all odd numbered sites .",
    "the corresponding stochastic process is one in which there is a constant rate of exchange of any two particles at nearest neighbour sites .",
    "as the original trimer model , this model has an infinite number of independent constants of motion . these are described most simply in terms of the `` irreducible string''(is ) @xcite .",
    "we consider free boundary conditions for convenience .",
    "each configuration can be represented as a string of @xmath10 characters , each character being one of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . from the string corresponding to a given configuration c ,",
    "delete all adjacent pairs of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "each such deletion decreases the length of the string by @xmath16 .",
    "repeat this operation on the resulting string until no more deletions are possible .",
    "this defines the is corresponding to c.    it is straightforward to extend the arguments of @xcite to our model , and show that the is is a constant of motion .",
    "in addition , any two configurations having the same is can be reached from each other . thus the is can be used to label the different sectors into which the vector space breaks up .    consider the set of all configurations in which no adjacent pair of sites are in the same state .",
    "these configurations will not evolve under the given dynamics and are said to be fully jammed .",
    "for these configurations the length @xmath50 of the irreducible string equals @xmath10 . the total number of such configurations is easily seen to be equal to @xmath51 .",
    "now consider sectors which are not totally jammed ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the number of sectors labelled by irreducible strings of length @xmath50 will be the number of distinct irreducible strings of length @xmath50 which is @xmath53 .",
    "the total number of sectors can be easily seen to be @xmath54 .",
    "now we proceed to calculate the sizes of these sectors , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of distinct configurations which belong to a particular sector . the size of a fully jammed sector is clearly @xmath55 .",
    "this is because a totally jammed configuration can not evolve and hence is the only member of that sector .",
    "let @xmath56 be the size of the sector labelled by irreducible string @xmath57 on a lattice of length @xmath10 .",
    "we define the generating function g(is , z ) = _ l = l^ d(is , l)z^l where the summation over @xmath10 extends from @xmath50 , the length of @xmath57 to infinity .",
    "of special interest is the sector corresponding to is of length zero .",
    "this we will call the null sector and denote its irreducible string by @xmath58 . to compute @xmath59 , we introduce a formal series which is a sum of all strings of arbitrary length , which are made up of three letters @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath26 , and reducible to @xmath58 .",
    "a string @xmath62 is said to be _",
    ", if the irreducible string @xmath63 and it can be written as @xmath64 such that @xmath65 . if @xmath66 denote the sum of all  indecomposable strings which are reducible to @xmath58 then @xmath67 satisfies the equation g()= [ eq : g1 ] further if @xmath68 denotes the the sum of all indecomposable strings which are reducible to @xmath58 and starting with the letter @xmath13 then g_i()=g_i^a+g_i^b+g_i^c [ eq : g2 ] @xmath68 is given by g_i^q = q  .  .",
    "q [ eq : g2.1 ] to get the generating function we replace all occurences of @xmath69 by @xmath70 in equation ( [ eq : g2.1 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath71 and @xmath72 all reduce to the same power series in @xmath70 , call it @xmath73 , given by g(z ) = this equation determine @xmath73 as an explicit function of @xmath70 given by g(z ) = ( 1 - ) /4 .",
    "[ eq : g ] using equations ( [ eq : g1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g2 ] ) , we get g(,z)= the growth of @xmath74 for large @xmath10 is determined by the singularities of @xmath73 nearest to the origin .",
    "this happens at @xmath75 . and",
    "since @xmath76 has a square root singularity near @xmath77 , it is easily verified that d(,l)~8^l/2  l^-3/2 for large @xmath10 .",
    "one can easily generalize this procedure to find the size of the sector when the irreducible string is of finite length @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath78 , where @xmath79 or @xmath26",
    ". then @xmath80 ( defined similarly as @xmath67 ) is given by g(is)=._1 .. _2.  .._l.g ( ) where @xmath81 .",
    "replacing @xmath69 by @xmath70 as before we get g(is , z)=[]^l [ eq : g1 ] where @xmath73 is given by equation ( [ eq : g ] ) and @xmath50 is the length of the irreducible string @xmath57 .",
    "then the size of the sector characterised by the irreducible string is is the coefficient of @xmath82 in ( [ eq : g1 ] ) , and hence d(is , l)=_c dz where integration is over a small circle encircling the origin . from this",
    "it is straightforward to find the asymptotic behavior of @xmath56 by doing the integral using the saddle point approximation .",
    "let @xmath83 . then d(is , l)~[k()]^l , [ sec_size1 ] where k()=(1-)^-(1-)/2  ( 1+)^-(1+)/2  2^(3-)/2 .",
    "[ sec_size2 ] thus , in general the size of a sector increases exponentially with @xmath10 and the growth constant depends on the density of the irreducible string . from this one",
    "can recover the results for the null and totally jammed sectors by noting that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the decomposition of the @xmath19 dimensional configuration space of the model into @xmath54 mutually disjoined sectors . this sector decomposition described in terms of the irreducible string @xmath57",
    "is maximal in the sense that it is possible to go from any configuration to any other configuration in the same sector .",
    "however , this only helps us to block diagonalize @xmath35 . in order to do better",
    ", we have to find additional operators that commute with @xmath35 .",
    "these operators are not completely diagonal in the configuration basis .",
    "we now describe how to construct such operators using the additional symmetries of our model .",
    "these symmetries are not present in the original @xmath4-mer model .",
    "they are also not present in our model if all the transition rates are not equal .",
    "using these symmetries we are able to reduce the task of diagonalizing the stochastic matrix with in a sector , by further block diagonalizing it .",
    "the deposition - evaporation model can be recast in the form of a generalized interface growth model , similar to the kpz model , where the variable at each site is a @xmath86 matrix instead of a scalar .",
    "this is seen as follows : we consider three non commuting matrices @xmath87 and @xmath88 such that @xmath89 , the identity matrix .",
    "a simple choice which satisfies these conditions is the unimodular matrices    rclrclrcl a(a)&= & (    cc1&0 + 1&-1    ) , & a(b)&= & (    cc1&1 + 0&-1    ) , a(c)&= & (    cc1&0 + 0&-1    )    alternately , we could choose them to be @xmath90 unitary matrices .",
    "for a configuration @xmath91 , we associate a @xmath86 matrix @xmath92 to every site @xmath38 given by i_i(c ) = a(q_i)  a(q_2)a(q_1 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the stochastic evolution of the dimer model can be cast in terms of matrices @xmath93 s by the following local evolution rule : if @xmath94 , then @xmath95 is reset randomly to any one of the three values @xmath96 at a constant rate say @xmath55 .",
    "the conservation law of the @xmath57 in this representation becomes the simple statement that @xmath97 is unchanged .",
    "a configuration of dimers is then equivalently characterized by specifying the matrix variables @xmath95 at each site @xmath38 .",
    "this matrix formulation brings out clearly the existence of a discrete group of infinite order in the model .",
    "if we work with free boundary conditions the set of allowed values of the of the matrices @xmath93 s can be put in one to one correspondence with the sites of a @xmath18-coordinated bethe lattice .",
    "identify one site of the bethe lattice as the origin and associate the identity matrix to this site .",
    "we color the bonds of this bethe lattice by three colors @xmath69 such that any three bonds meeting at a site are all of different colors .",
    "the matrix @xmath98 corresponding to a site @xmath99 of the bethe lattice is given by the ordered product of @xmath100s @xmath101 along the unique path from the origin to @xmath99 .",
    "a sequence @xmath102 , @xmath103 to @xmath10 specifies a configuration of the dde model , and also a unique @xmath10-step path on the bethe lattice which starts at the origin . as an example , the path corresponding to the configuration @xmath104 is shown in figure [ b_l_rep ] .",
    "configurations in the null sector correspond to paths that return to the origin .",
    "any pair of adjacent spins that are in the same state in the dimer configuration will corresponds to an immediate retraversal of a step on the bethe lattice .",
    "the stochastic evolution in the dde model leads to a stochastic evolution of this @xmath10-step polymer chain on the bethe lattice",
    ". an elementary movement of this polymer chain dynamics is illustrated in figure [ b_l_rep ] , where the transition from the configuration @xmath105 to @xmath106 is shown .",
    "the operation of interchange of one branch of the bethe lattice with another is a symmetry of @xmath35 since this only corresponds to a recoloring of the bonds .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ br_flip ] , where we have considered only one branch starting from the origin .",
    "at every site @xmath99 on the bethe lattice define an operator @xmath107 which interchanges the two subtrees starting from that site and going away from the origin .",
    "@xmath108 changes a configuration @xmath109 to @xmath110 where @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a matrix valued function of its argument .",
    "clearly @xmath113=0 $ ] .",
    "we say that site @xmath114 is descendant of site @xmath99 if the unique path connecting @xmath114 to the origin goes through @xmath99 . from the figure",
    "it can be seen that @xmath115=0 $ ] if neither @xmath99 nor @xmath114 is a descendant of the other . if @xmath114 is a descendant of @xmath99 then @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the operator at site @xmath118 which is obtained from site @xmath114 by the action of @xmath107 . in figure [ br_flip ] for example , @xmath119=0 $ ] . but",
    "@xmath120\\ne 0 $ ] since @xmath16 is a descendant of @xmath55 .",
    "instead they satisfy the relation @xmath121 .",
    "this symmetry comes from the geometrical symmetry of the underlying bethe lattice .",
    "this in turn is related to the internal color symmetry in the model , and we will call it recoloring symmetry c.    in addition to these one has a permutation symmetry of order @xmath18 ( @xmath122 ) about the origin which corresponds to interchanging the @xmath18 color labels globally . the set of operators @xmath123 together with the operators corresponding to @xmath122 will constitute an infinite set of conserved quantities , which are however not all commuting with each other .",
    "one interesting consequence of the recoloring symmetry is that the spectrum of @xmath35 in a sector depends only on the length @xmath50 of the irreducible string and not on its details .",
    "this can be seen as follows : for a general sector , the endpoints of all the paths on the bethe lattice will be fixed .",
    "the shortest path connecting these two points corresponds to the irreducible string .",
    "all @xmath124s such that site @xmath99 does not belong to this path leaves the irreducible string and hence the sector it labels invariant . on the other hand one can go from one irreducible string to any another one having the same length by a series of branch flip operations using the @xmath124 operators which are on the shortest path . since each of these operations are symmetry operations of @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath125=0 $ ] for all @xmath99 , the spectrum will be identical for all these sectors .",
    "this property is not present in the original @xmath4-mer model .",
    "we can make use of these symmetries for further block diagonalisation of @xmath35 with in a sector .",
    "this is achieved by breaking the state space spanned by all the configurations in a particular sector into subspaces .",
    "we illustrate this with a few examples .    for convenience we will consider the case of null sector .",
    "first consider a lattice of length @xmath16 .",
    "there are only three configurations in this sector which are @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in this case",
    "we can get all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian using @xmath122 .",
    "consider the states    lcl & = & + + + & = & + + ^2 + & = & + ^2 + .",
    "where @xmath128 is the cube root of unity .",
    "these are the eigenstates of the operator corresponding to cyclic permutation of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath26 ( @xmath129 ) with eigenvalues @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively . since @xmath132=0 $ ] these are also the eigenstates of @xmath35 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath35 corresponding to these eigenvectors are @xmath133 .",
    "thus in this case we were able to diagonalize @xmath35 completely .",
    "but this is a rather trivial example .",
    "next we consider the case of @xmath134 .",
    "there are @xmath135 states in this sector .",
    "first we consider the symmetry operations about the sites @xmath55 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 as shown in figure [ bl_l4 ]",
    ". consider the states    lcl & = & ( - ) + & = & ( - ) + & = & ( - ) .",
    "+    [ psi ] these are the non - degenerate eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath136 of @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively .",
    "it can be verified very easily that these are also eigenstates of @xmath35 .",
    "this gives us a decomposition of the @xmath135 dimensional vector space into subspaces of dimensions @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "using the cyclic permutation symmetry at the origin , we can get a further decomposition of the @xmath141 dimensional subspace .",
    "for this consider the eigenstates of @xmath129    lcl & = & ( + + ) + & = & ( + + ) + & = & ( + + ) + & = & ( + + + & & +  + + ) + & & + & = & ( + + ^2 ) + & = & ( + + ^2 ) + & = & ( + + ^2 ) + & = & ( ( + ) + ( + & & +  ) + ^2(+ ) ) + & & + & = & ( + ^2 + ) + & = & ( + ^2 + ) + & = & ( + ^2 + ) + & = & ( ( + )",

    "thus we have got the following decomposition of the @xmath135 dimensional vector space spanned by all the configurations in the null sector in to subspaces of dimensions . 1 +",
    "1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4=15 we have carried out the same procedure for the case of @xmath145 . in this case",
    "the size of the null sector is @xmath146 . using the @xmath124 operators , this",
    "can be broken into 18 subspaces out of which @xmath141 are of size @xmath55 , @xmath18 are of size @xmath22 and another @xmath18 are of size @xmath147 .",
    "a further decomposition of these subspaces can be achieved using the symmetry of dynamics under reflection . using both the color and reflection symmetries ,",
    "the resulting form of the decomposition of the vector space for the case @xmath145 is 87 = 121 + 33 + 34 + 36 + 3 12 . where @xmath148 means @xmath149 subspaces of size @xmath150 .    in principle",
    "this procedure can be carried out for a lattice of any length . for a linear chain of length @xmath10 , sites up to distance @xmath151 from the origin on the bethe lattice are reachable .",
    "the number of sites that are one step away from the boundary and inside will be @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) . as we have seen for @xmath134 , the antisymmetric eigenstates of the @xmath154 operators on each of these sites will be an eigenstate of @xmath35 .",
    "thus one can easily get a large number of eigenstates in this model . by constructing the antisymmetric eigenstates of the @xmath154 operators on sites which are interior to this",
    ", one can get invariant subspaces as we have seen in the case of @xmath145 ( the 3 sectors of size 7 ) .",
    "so far we have not been able to get a general result for the total number of subspaces and their sizes within a sector as a result of this symmetry .",
    "but one can use this symmetry for the numerical diagonalization of the stochastic matrix for small sizes , where one can restrict oneself to one subspace ( say the symmetric subspace where all the eigenvalues of the @xmath155 operators are @xmath55 ) .",
    "this we have done to estimate the dynamical exponent in the null sector , where we have seen that these additional symmetries lead to substantial decrease in the size of the matrices to be diagonalized .",
    "these results are discussed in section @xmath23",
    "in the previous section we have constructed some of the eigenvectors of the stochastic matrix in the null sector using the recoloring symmetry of the dynamics of @xmath10-step chain on the bethe lattice . in this section",
    "we show that the same procedure can be used to construct eigenvectors in sectors which are almost totally jammed , _",
    "i.e. _ the length of the irreducible string @xmath156 , where @xmath150 is a small integer .    as we explained in the earlier section ,",
    "the spectrum of @xmath35 is the same for all the sectors whose irreducible strings are of same length .",
    "so we need to consider only one representative sector which we choose to be the one in which the irreducible string is @xmath157 .",
    "consider the case when @xmath158 .",
    "we use periodic boundary condition for convenience .",
    "there are two types of configurations in this sector . in the first type",
    "there will be three adjacent sites , say @xmath159 and @xmath160 which are of the same color ( either @xmath161 or @xmath162 _ e.g. _ @xmath163 ) .",
    "let these states be denoted by @xmath164 . in the second type there will be two adjacent sites , say @xmath165 and @xmath160 which are having color @xmath26 .",
    "( _ e.g. _ @xmath166 .",
    "let this type of states be denoted by @xmath167 .",
    "in both these types site @xmath165 and site @xmath160 have the same color and thus constitute a reducible part",
    ". it can be very easily seen that under the deposition - evaporation dynamics , the position of the reducible part makes a nearest neighbour random walk .",
    "hence the dynamics in this sector is equivalent to a random walk problem with two states per site ( @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath170 and eigenvalues @xmath171 of the stochastic matrix can be found by solving this random walk problem .",

    "the leading behavior of the correlation function can be shown to be stretched exponential decay by a similar argument as in the previous case . by symmetry of the irreducible string",
    "the behaviour should be the same for all the correlation functions and on both the sublattices .",
