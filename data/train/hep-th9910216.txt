    "much of the work in string theory in the last years has been devoted to dualities between seemingly different physical theories .",
    "a remarkable aspect of these dualities is that they involve often a geometrization of physics , that is there is a correspondence of physical quantities with data of a geometric object . in extreme cases ,",
    "one arrives at a duality between a physical theory and a geometric theory , with the physical data such as the moduli space , symmetries , spectrum and even correlation functions being in one - to one correspondence with the quantities of a geometric theory .",
    "in particular , if the coupling constants of the physical theory are mapped to geometric parameters , the duality provides an extremely powerful tool to study quantum effects in the physical theory .    generally , the most useful formulation of the geometric theory is in terms of complex geometries @xmath1 , with the complex deformations of @xmath1 being equivalent to the moduli space @xmath2 of scalar vev s @xmath3 of the physics theory .",
    "the geometry @xmath1 can be defined as the zero locus of a holomorphic polynomial in some ambient space @xmath4 w :  p_w(x_i , u_)=0 , where @xmath5 are holomorphic coordinates on @xmath4 and @xmath6 parametrize the complex structure of @xmath1 .",
    "the idea is that there is a map @xmath7 which maps the complex structure moduli space of @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "the prototype for the relation between a complex geometry @xmath1 and a physical system is the case of @xmath8 @xmath9 super - yang - mills theory in four - dimensions , whose one - dimensional moduli space on the coulomb branch has been shown to be equivalent to the complex deformations of a torus @xcite .",
    "however it was realized shortly later @xcite that this relation is only a special example of a very general connection between complex geometries of calabi ",
    "yau 3-fold singularities and @xmath8 supersymmetric gravity free quantum field theories in four dimensions .",
    "the link between geometry and physics is provided by d - brane geometries in type iib strings in the following way .",
    "if the type iib string is compactified on a calabi ",
    "yau 3-fold @xmath10 with small 3-cycles @xmath11 , there are extra light states from d3-branes wrapped on the @xmath11 . in the limit of vanishing volume",
    "these states give rise to massless charged particles in uncompactified space - time @xcite , with their quantum numbers and interactions determined by the geometry of the cycle @xmath11 embedded in @xmath10 . since the type ii string coupling is in the hypermultiplet sector , which does not couple neutrally to the vector multiplets , the exact effective two derivative action of the vector multiplets on the coulomb branch is given by the tree level type iib physics , which in turn is determined by the classical complex geometry . in the limit of very small 3-cycles , which means we consider singular geometries , one can decouple gravity and most of the fundamental string spectrum and obtains an equivalence between the complex deformations of calabi ",
    "yau 3-fold singularities and the coulomb branch of general gravity free @xmath8 qft s in four dimensions .",
    "apart from the exact non - perturbative effective action , there are other important non - perturbative data of the field theory , such as the stable bps spectrum @xcite and s - duality symmetries @xcite , that are determined in the exact tree level type iib theory and thus , the geometry of the singularity .",
    "this relation between geometric calabi  yau 3-fold singularities and gravity free qft s can be extended @xcite to theories with @xmath12 supersymmetries by replacing the type ii string theory with f - theory @xcite . in this case",
    "we obtain field theories that are embedded in minimal supersymmetric string theories in @xmath13 dimensions , in particular @xmath12 supersymmetric string theories in four dimensions",
    ".    an especially interesting class of the latter consists of heterotic string compactifications on calabi ",
    "yau 3-folds @xmath14 , which are the most promising perturbative string theories from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "however an aspect of these so - called @xmath15 vacua that has turned out to be difficult to study , is the specification of a suitable gauge background , which takes the form of a holomorphic stable vector bundle ( or sheaf ) on @xmath14 .",
    "it turns out @xcite that these bundles appear as the moduli space of a certain class of field theories that are `` dual '' to calabi ",
    "yau 4-fold singularities in the previous sense and can be constructed and studied using the geometric duality , very much as in the case of @xmath8 supersymmetric qft s .",
    "again we obtain non - perturbative information from the geometric perspective and in particular the geometric construction generalizes to non - perturbative vacua of the heterotic string , including those with background 5-branes @xcite and non - perturbative gauge symmetries .",
    "we have mentioned already that the crucial link between the geometric singularities and the physical system associated to it is provided by the curved geometry of d - branes of type ii strings wrapped on vanishing cycles .",
    "however , to reduce supersymmetry , we need to compactify f - theory on the singularity , rather than type ii strings . in general",
    ", f - theory has a very different way to generate massless states , in particular from open strings stretching between background d7 branes .",
    "however note that in the duality between f - theory compactified on a calabi ",
    "yau @xmath16-fold @xmath17 times a torus @xmath18 and type iia on @xmath17 , the radii of @xmath18 are mapped to geometric moduli of the type iia theory on @xmath17 .",
    "we can therefore describe the minimal supersymmetric theory from f - theory on @xmath17 in terms of a type iia compactification on the f - theory - limit of @xmath17 , defined as the patch in the geometric moduli of type iia on @xmath17 that corresponds to the decompactification of the @xmath18 factor in the dual f - theory compactification . as a matter of fact",
    "this allows to adopt many of the methods developed in the @xmath8 context to the minimal supersymmetric case .",
    "in particular one can establish in this way the following geometric duality :    similarly as in the @xmath8 context , one needs only type iia ( and f - theory ) physics to establish the above equivalence .",
    "a necessary assumption that is needed is that @xmath19 is elliptically fibered .",
    "the equivalence holds for any structure group @xmath20 of the bundle .",
    "note that the moduli space of the @xmath12 field theory appearing on the right hand side of the above table is precisely the same as that of the gauge background of a heterotic compactification on @xmath19 in the point particle limit , under the condition that the structure @xmath20 fits in the perturbative heterotic gauge symmetry @xmath21 , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath22 .",
    "since one arrives at the above equivalence using only type iia / f - theory physics , one can _ derive _ type iia / heterotic and f - theory / heterotic duality in the point particle limit .",
    "note that the equivalence is true for _ any _ @xmath20 ; for @xmath23 it becomes equivalent to a duality with the heterotic string in the point particle limit .",
    "since the field theory involved in the geometric duality is so closely related to a string theory compactification , about which we do not have a good control , it makes sense to consider the reverse process of decoupling gravity and find _ global _ embeddings of the singularities @xmath24 into compact calabi ",
    "yau manifolds @xmath25 to describe dual pairs of the full f - theory / heterotic and iia / heterotic dualities away from the point particle limit .",
    "interestingly one finds that global embeddings exist precisely if @xmath26 . while it is expected from the physics point of view that we recover the known consistent string theories in this way , the result is non - trivial from the geometric point of view .",
    "the global embeddings define dual pairs of string duality ( as opposed to the relation between singularity and field theory ) , namely a compact calabi ",
    "yau @xmath27-fold @xmath25 on which f - theory is compactified and a compact calabi ",
    "yau @xmath19 together with a family of holomorphic stable vector bundles @xmath28 on it that describe the dual heterotic data .",
    "moreover one obtains a precise map of the moduli spaces of the two theories in the point particle limit .",
    "we can then _ use _ the duality @xmath29 away from this limit to study non - perturbative properties of the minimal supersymmetric heterotic string vacua .",
    "at first sight it is not obvious that f - theory compactified on the geometric singularities @xmath24 describes holomorphic stable vector bundles on compact calabi ",
    "yau manifolds @xmath19 of one complex dimension less .",
    "the relation between the geometric singularity and vector bundles can be traced back to a symmetry of type iia on k3@xmath30 @xcite that is closely related to mirror symmetry on k3 .",
    "consider a type iia string compactified on a k3 surface .",
    "this gives an @xmath31 supersymmetric theory in six dimensions . from dimensional",
    "reduction we obtain twenty @xmath8 vector multiplets which contain as their bosonic degrees of freedom each one vector and four real scalars .",
    "the latter transform as a @xmath32 under an @xmath33 r - symmetry and parametrize the 58 metric moduli of k3 plus 22 values of the @xmath34-fields on @xmath35 .    in a a given algebraic realization @xmath36 of k3 , the 80 moduli of k3 split in complexified khler and complex structure moduli , denote the complex dimension of a geometry . ] .",
    "the @xmath33 rotations acting on the scalars in @xmath32 do not preserve this split in general .",
    "in particular there is an @xmath33 rotation that exchanges khler and complex structure moduli spaces @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "such a transformation is usually known as _ mirror symmetry _ of k3 manifolds , which says that a type iia string compactified on @xmath36 describes the same physics as a type iia string compactification on a `` different '' k3 manifold @xmath39 , with the khler and complex structure moduli exchanged . the new algebraic k3 surface @xmath39 is called the mirror manifold of @xmath36 .",
    "we have the following identifications under mirror symmetry : [ msi ] m_2 w_2 , @xmath40    there is an intriguing generalization of this symmetry upon compactification on a further @xmath18 to four dimensions .",
    "in this case we obtain an @xmath41 supersymmetric string theory .",
    "the @xmath41 vector multiplet now contains 6 scalars which transform in a @xmath42 of an @xmath43 symmetry .",
    "the two extra scalars are the internal components @xmath44 of the six - dimensional gauge fields on the @xmath18 , call it @xmath45 , and thus parametrize the stringy moduli space of wilson lines on the elliptic curve , @xmath46 . here @xmath20 denotes the structure group of the wilson line background .",
    "again the @xmath43 rotations provide identifications within the type iia moduli space @xmath47 : [ msii ] m_km(m_2 ) m_cs(w_2 ) ( h ) .",
    "in particular there is now an element of @xmath43 , corresponding to the last arrow , which provides a relation between the moduli space of stringy wilson lines on @xmath45 with the khler moduli space of an algebraic k3 manifold .",
    "let us illustrate the symmetry ( [ msii ] ) of the type iia compactification on k3 @xmath48 in the dual heterotic picture where it is very natural ; however we stress that we do not need the heterotic dual to derive the symmetry .",
    "[ f : fhetdualii ] shows the type iia compactification and the corresponding dual heterotic string compactified on @xmath49 .",
    "to    the factorization of @xmath50 on the heterotic side is related to @xmath51 the elliptic fibration and @xmath52 the factorization of the gauge background on k3 @xmath48 in the type iia theory . under these circumstances ,",
    "the khler moduli of k3 can be identified with moduli space @xmath53 of @xmath54 wilson lines on the first @xmath55 and similarly complex structure moduli with wilson lines in the second factor @xmath56 .",
    "the non - abelian gauge symmetry in six dimensions is @xmath57 which on the type iia side arises from the @xmath57 singularity and on the heterotic side is the commutant of @xmath58 in @xmath59 . upon further compactification to four dimensions on a torus @xmath60",
    ", we obtain another factor @xmath61 on both sides .",
    "the heterotic theory has an obvious symmetry under permutation of the three @xmath18 factors .",
    "the exchange of the first two tori amounts to mirror symmetry in the type iia theory . on the other hand an exchange that involves the third torus gives a new symmetry of the moduli space of the type iia compactification that identifies wilson lines with structure group @xmath57 on @xmath18 with either khler or complex deformations of a @xmath57 singularity of k3 .",
    "this is the new relation described in ( [ msii ] ) .",
    "finally we can decouple most of the fundamental string states and gravity in the limit of a singular geometry of the k3 , or in terms of physics , in the field theory limit .",
    "the elliptically fibered 2-fold singularities @xmath62 that describe the local patch in @xmath36 ( and similarly a local geometry @xmath63 for the complex geometry side ) obtained in this limit describe field theory wilson lines on a torus @xmath45 : [ e : equi ] m_km(m_2 ) m_cs(w_2 ) m^ft_e(h ) .",
    "note that this relation will be more general as the one obtained in the global k3 context . in the latter ,",
    "@xmath64 is bounded from above by the dimension of @xmath35 , whereas in ( [ e : equi ] ) we can actually consider local singularities of ale spaces of arbitrary rank .    the above field theory limit is compatible with taking the f - theory limit of the type iia theory .",
    "the f - theory compactification on @xmath63 gives then the deliberate geometric dual we are looking for .",
    "in the previous section we have seen how holomorphic ( semi-)stable bundles on a calabi",
    " yau 1-fold , or simply wilson lines on @xmath18 , are related to f - theory compactified on a 2 complex dimensional calabi  yau singularity @xmath63 . to obtain holomorphic stable bundles on calabi ",
    "yau @xmath16-folds , we consider holomorphic fibrations of @xmath63 over some @xmath65 complex dimensional base @xmath66 . the total space @xmath24 , which is required to satisfy the calabi ",
    "yau condition in order to be a valid type iia and f - theory background , is an @xmath27 dimensional non - compact singularity with an elliptic fibration inherited from that of @xmath63 .",
    "the dual heterotic picture is the following @xcite : the data of @xmath20 wilson lines on @xmath18 are fibered over the same base @xmath66 , in virtue of the adiabatic principle @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 fibration over @xmath66 results in a compact calabi ",
    "yau @xmath16-fold @xmath19 on which the heterotic string is compactified and the gauge background on @xmath18 extends to a family of holomorphic stable bundles on @xmath19 .",
    "let us now sketch the general form of the dual singularities @xmath24 which have a nice geometric and group theoretical interpretation .",
    "let @xmath67 denote a special set of coordinates on the elliptically fibered ale space @xmath63 ; in particular @xmath68 is a coordinate on the base @xmath69 of the elliptic fibration of @xmath63 .",
    "moreover the @xmath5 are coordinates on the base @xmath66 of the @xmath63 fibration of @xmath24 .",
    "the singularity @xmath24 is defined as the vanishing of the polynomial @xmath70 : @xmath71 we have divided the polynomial @xmath70 in a @xmath68 independent part @xmath72 and a @xmath68 dependent piece @xmath73 .",
    "they describe the geometry @xmath19 and the gauge bundle @xmath28 on @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "in fact @xmath72 is the defining equation for the elliptically fibered , compact calabi ",
    "yau @xmath19 in weierstrass form .",
    "the polynomial @xmath73 that describes the bundle has a very nice group theoretical structure . if we consider the extended dynkin diagram of the structure group @xmath20 of @xmath28 , then each node of index @xmath74 contributes precisely one monomial @xmath75 to @xmath73 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath76 we have @xmath77 nodes of index one and the equation for @xmath73 becomes ( for @xmath77 even ) p_+=v^1(z^n  a_n(x_i)+ xz^n-2  a_n-2(x_i)+ ",
    "+x^n/2 a_0(x_i ) ) . since in this case",
    "@xmath68 appears only linearly in @xmath70 , it can be integrated out as far as variation of the complex structure is concerned .",
    "this yields the two separate conditions @xmath78 and @xmath79=0 .",
    "the first equation defines @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath77 roots of the second equation determine @xmath77 points on the elliptic fiber @xmath45 of @xmath19 , with their position on @xmath45 varying with the values of the base variables @xmath5 .",
    "we thus recover the spectral cover construction of @xmath76 bundles on elliptic fibrations described in @xmath80 .",
    "more generally , we obtain a similar geometric representation of families of holomorphic stable bundles on @xmath19 for any @xmath20 .",
    "the actual construction of the geometries @xmath24 can be phrased best in the framework of toric geometry .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being very general , in particular in treating general calabi ",
    "yau manifolds @xmath19 with non - smooth elliptic fibrations , as well as studying singularities in both , the geometric and gauge data .",
    "moreover one can define a toric map that identifies the dual objects f :  w_n+1(z_n , v ) , with important physical data of the heterotic side , such as the geometry of the manifold @xmath19 , the family of bundles on it , non - perturbative 5-branes or gauge symmetries and the stability of the bundle having a very simple and systematic representation in terms of the toric geometry of the singularity @xmath24 on the left side @xcite .",
    "this allows for a simple construction of deliberate families of stable bundles @xmath28 with arbitrary structure group @xmath20 on any toric calabi  yau in terms of the singularity @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath81 one can easily determine the possible global embeddings of the local singularity @xmath82 , where @xmath25 is now the global calabi ",
    "yau @xmath27-fold which gives the dual _ string _ theory when used as an f - theory compactification .",
    "the map @xmath83 can then be used to study non - perturbative properties of the minimal supersymmetric heterotic string theory on @xmath19 , as is illustrated in the next section .",
    "let us finally sketch some results on ( non - perturbative ) heterotic physics which have been obtained in @xcite  using the above method .",
    "we complained already that it is very hard to find explicit solutions to the stability equations for @xmath28 and in the sequel we claimed that we can construct a large class of such stable bundles seemingly without effort using the geometric singularities @xmath24 .",
    "obviously , there has to be quite a good reason for this simplification in the geometric construction .",
    "indeed there is one important property of the geometric singularities @xmath24 that we did not interpret so far in the heterotic duals : the calabi  yau condition that ensures that the type iia , or f - theory , compactified on @xmath24 is consistent .",
    "indeed one can show @xcite that the calabi ",
    "yau property of @xmath24 translates to a stability condition on the background @xmath28 on @xmath19 , expressed in terms of a bound on the first chern class @xmath84 of a line bundle @xmath85 that is an important characteristic data of the vector bundle @xmath28 on @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "one finds that [ e : ebound ] ( g )   c_1(l )  ( 12 c_1(l )  ) , where @xmath57 is the singularity type of the fiber geometry @xmath39 and @xmath86 is a certain characteristic number defined in @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath85 and the bounds on @xmath87 for toric bases , such as @xmath88 and @xmath89 and blow ups thereof , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the answer to why it was so easy to get stable solutions from the geometric construction is thus that we have replaced the complicated condition for stability in the heterotic string , about which we have poor control , with the simple calabi  yau condition on the dual type iia / f - theory side , which is much easier to deal with .",
    "a simple solution to solve the background equations for @xmath28 is to set the gauge connection equal to the spin connection of the manifold , @xmath90 .",
    "this is the so - called standard embedding .",
    "though this configuration is not too appealing for phenomenology - in four dimensions , the heterotic gauge group is @xmath91 and the matter spectrum is tied to the euler number of @xmath14 - it has been studied extensively in the past because it was one of the few known solutions .",
    "the structure group of @xmath28 is @xmath92 for a calabi ",
    "yau @xmath16-fold .",
    "the global geometry @xmath25 corresponding to the f - theory dual can be determined in the following way . from the fact that the bundle in the second factor is trivial",
    "it follows that the line bundle @xmath85 is trivial in the second @xmath93 factor .",
    "the weierstrass form for @xmath25 and @xmath19 takes the following form : [ tbiii ] p_z_n&&=y^2+x^3+xz^4f+z^6g , p_w_n&&=y^2+x^3+x(z w)^4f+(z w)^6g+^6z^5w^7+^6z^7w^5 . here",

    "similar results hold for four - dimensional compactifications .",
    "we point out that the above triviality condition on the spectral cover does not imply that the field strength of @xmath28 , which measures the behavior of @xmath28 near the singularity , is trivial .",
    "in fact it has been shown recently in @xcite that if @xmath99 on the singularity , the conformal field theory of the heterotic string is well behaved and there is no non - perturbative gauge symmetry .",
    "the map @xmath100 can be ambiguous in the sense that there are two ( or even more ) ways to associate a pair @xmath101 to @xmath25 .",

    "note that the duality exchanges the groups of the geometric singularity and the gauge bundle : the singularity in the dual manifold is the commutant of the structure group and _ vice versa_. let us give an extreme example of such an duality : the heterotic string with a trivial gauge bundle on a smooth k3 has a perturbative @xmath22 gauge symmetry and in addition @xmath105 non - perturbative tensor multiplets from the 24 five - branes required to satisfy anomaly cancellation in six dimensions .",

    "this duality reminds very much of a known duality in the linear sigma model formulation of heterotic strings , namely a symmetry under the exchange of the data defining the manifold and the data defining the bundle @xcite .",

    "if the mirror manifold @xmath108 of @xmath106 is also elliptically fibered , there is also a heterotic theory @xmath109 associated to it and one can ask the question of how the two theories are related .",
    "the answer is that after compactification on a three - torus to three dimensions , the two become equivalent in virtue of mirror symmetry of type ii strings @xcite .",
    "a proposal for the relation between @xmath107 and @xmath109 has been made in @xcite based on a comparison of hodge numbers and gauge symmetries in some cases . using the toric map @xmath97 one can determine the two theories",

    "the general relation is of a similar form as in @xmath110 above : a heterotic theory with a @xmath57 bundle compactified on a k3 manifold with @xmath111 singularity gets mapped to a heterotic theory with a bundle with structure group @xmath111 compactified on a manifold with @xmath57 singularity .",
    "note that we have an explicit map of the moduli spaces of the two theories .",
    "it would be interesting to formulate the associated three - dimensional dual pairs associated to this relation , as in @xcite .",
    "the geometric construction of minimal supersymmetric heterotic string vacua in four dimensions and their f - theory duals opens an interesting way to study phenomenologically relevant string compactifications .",
