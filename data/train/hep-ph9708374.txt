    "low energy measurements can serve as useful probes of higher energy scales , because the virtual effects of heavy particles influence low energy observables .",
    "hence , low energy measurements can constrain possible new physics scenarios .",
    "the most striking example of this effect was the `` virtual top - quark discovery '' .",
    "when the top - quark mass was first measured through direct production at the tevatron , the precision electroweak data had already constrained the mass with about the same central value and uncertainty @xcite .    in the standard model some observables are sensitive to the square of the top - quark mass and the logarithm of the higgs boson mass .",
    "hence , both these masses can be constrained by precision data . in supersymmetric models ,",
    "some observables are sensitive to the supersymmetric masses .",
    "just as with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , there are values of supersymmetric parameters in conflict with measurements .",
    "we will discuss the results of a global fit to precision data in supersymmetric models .    before discussing the supersymmetric case , we review the results of a global fit within the standard model .",
    "this serves as a useful barometer for comparison with the supersymmetric models .",
    "also , the supersymmetric models reduce to the standard model as the supersymmetric mass scale becomes large .",
    "the supersymmetric corrections decouple as @xmath7 ( or faster ) .",
    "the only remnant of supersymmetry in the large @xmath8 limit is the light higgs boson mass ( which remains a prediction of the model ) .",
    "= ?    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the standard model we take as inputs the muon decay constant , @xmath9 , the @xmath10-boson mass , @xmath2 , the top quark mass , @xmath5 , the higgs boson mass , @xmath6 , the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath11 , and the strong coupling , @xmath12 .",
    "the last two couplings are taken in the  scheme at the @xmath10-scale .",
    "given these six inputs we have predictions for all other observables in the standard model .",
    "we consider the list of observables below , and find the values of the five inputs as a fixed input . ] which minimize the total @xmath0 . in this way we find the best fit values of the input parameters and the standard model predictions for all the observables .",
    "the observables we include in our @xmath0 are    * line - shape and lepton asymmetries .",
    "these are the @xmath10-mass , the @xmath10-width , the peak hadronic cross - section , the ratio of the hadronic width to the leptonic widths , and the leptonic forward - backward asymmetries : @xmath2 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",

    "we are left with 21 degrees of freedom .",
    "in table 1 we list the results of the standard model fit .",
    "we list the measured values with the errors @xcite , the standard model predictions , and the pull , which is defined to be the difference between the measured value and the standard model prediction , divided by the error . if we sum the squares of the pulls we obtain the @xmath0 of the best fit , which in this case is 29.57 . with 21 degrees of freedom",
    ", this corresponds to a probability of 10.1% .",
    "this means that if the standard model does describe the data , in a random variate ( a set of measured values with central values distributed randomly in a gaussian fashion ) the probability that the @xmath0 is greater than 29.57 is 10.1% .",
    "this 10.1% probability may sound low , but we consider it to be reasonable .",
    "remember that the `` best '' we could hope for is 50% ( higher than that would suggest that the data fits the predictions `` too well '' ) . in the days",
    "when @xmath33 was 3.5@xmath34 off , the goodness of the fit was much less than 1% .",
    "the best fit values of some inputs are @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 we show contours of constant @xmath0 in the @xmath38 plane in fig .  1 . the contours correspond to 68% and 90% confidence .",
    "we see that @xmath6 is constrained to be less than 400 gev at 95% cl .",
    "there are two approaches to @xmath0 analyses in supersymmetric models which one might consider . in the first approach one",
    "tries to repair the discrepancies seen between the data and the standard model @xcite .",
    "for example , the standard model prediction for @xmath33 used to be 3.5@xmath34 off",
    ". one could find regions of supersymmetric parameter space where this discrepancy was repaired @xcite .",
    "now , however , there are no large ( @xmath39 ) discrepancies , and the largest deviations can not be repaired by supersymmetry .",
    "this approach is no longer useful , since the supersymmetric corrections can not reduce the @xmath0 significantly , and one has to pay the price of the smaller number of degrees of freedom .    in the other approach ,",
    "one notices that there are significant regions of parameter space where the supersymmetric corrections make the fit worse .",
    "consider the plot , @xmath40 and @xmath3 .",
    "some region of the curve has superpartners lighter than the current limits .",
    "] of @xmath0 vs. @xmath8 in fig .  2 .",
    "at large @xmath8 the @xmath0 approaches the standard model value ( with the light higgs mass determined as a function of the supersymmetric parameters ) . at smaller @xmath8",
    ", the @xmath0 typically rises ; the unsuppressed supersymmetric radiative corrections can result in a terrible fit . here",
    "we focus on this approach , elucidating the regions of parameter space where the @xmath0 is so large that those points can be ruled out .",
    "notice there are two competing effects which will continue to determine the utility of this approach . as the data becomes more precise , the smaller errors will lead to larger values of @xmath0 ( assuming the discrepancies are real ) . at the same time , as more data is accumulated , the limits on the supersymmetric mass spectrum are increased .",
    "one must then consider larger values of the supersymmetric masses , and this leads to smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "we will show the results of the @xmath0 analysis in three supersymmetric models .",
    "the `` minimal supergravity '' model @xcite is perhaps the most commonly considered high scale model .",
    "here we take as boundary conditions at the gut scale ( the scale where @xmath41 ) a universal scalar mass @xmath42 , a universal gaugino mass @xmath43 , and a universal trilinear scalar coupling @xmath44 .",
    "we also take as an input the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath45 , and the sign of the @xmath46-term .",
    "consider two assumptions which are necessary in order to arrive at the `` minimal supergravity '' model .",
    "first , one must assume a flat khler metric .",
    "second , one assumes the universality of the scalar masses is maintained from the planck scale to the gut scale . both of these assumptions seem artificial and unrealistic , especially the latter .",
    "however , they are useful for simplicity and economy , and in particular they guarantee that the model is free of potentially disastrous fcnc problems .",
    "also , the running of the parameters between the planck scale and the gut scale is model dependent , so it makes sense that the minimal model assumes no running .    models with gauge - mediated ( gm ) supersymmetry breaking @xcite comprise a class which is automatically free of fcnc problems . here",
    ", the supersymmetry breaking is communicated from the hidden sector to the visible sector through the interactions of the gauge fields and the messenger fields . in the minimal model",
    "the superpotential contains a singlet which acquires both a vev @xmath47 and an @xmath48-term @xmath49 .",
    "the singlet is coupled to the messenger fields , which are in a vector - like representation under the standard model gauge group .",
    "the supersymmetric spectrum is proportional to @xmath50 , with dependence on the messenger field representation .",
    "we consider two models , a model with a  messenger sector and a model with a  messenger sector .",
    "the boundary conditions for the soft masses are applied at the messenger mass scale , @xmath51 .",
    "again , we take @xmath4 and the sign of @xmath46 as inputs .    in both the supergravity and gauge - mediated models we impose radiative electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "starting with a common positive higgs boson mass - squared at the gut scale or the messenger scale , we evolve the higgs masses down to the weak - scale using the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) @xcite . because of the large top - quark yukawa coupling ,",
    "the mass - squared of the higgs which couples to the top , @xmath52 , is driven negative in the vicinity of the electroweak scale .",
    "this signals the breaking of electroweak symmetry , and requiring this to occur allows us to solve for the heavy higgs boson mass and the higgsino mass as a function of the input parameters : @xmath53\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the gauge - mediated models we implicitly assume that whatever mechanism is responsible for the generation of the @xmath54 and @xmath46 terms does not give rise to contributions to the soft scalar masses .",
    "the overview of the @xmath0 analysis is as follows :    1 .   pick starting values for @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   pick a random point in supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "3 .   for fixed @xmath55",
    "solve the supersymmetry model by iteration .",
    "+ here we have two - sided boundary conditions . we know the gauge and yukawa couplings and @xmath4 at the weak scale and the soft parameters at the high scale .",
    "we include full one - loop corrections in the evaluation of the gauge and yukawa couplings , and in the higgs sector ( both the light higgs boson mass and electroweak symmetry breaking ) .",
    "4 .   compute @xmath0 . here",
    "we include the full one - loop supersymmetric corrections to every observable , with two caveats : * we use the oblique approximation for the evaluation of atomic parity violation weak charges * the susy box diagrams are neglected in @xmath10-pole observables 5 .",
    "minimize @xmath0 with respect to @xmath56 for the fixed set of supersymmetric corrections . 6 .",
    "if not converged , go to step 3 .",
    "apply current limits on the superpartner and higgs boson mass spectrum from direct searches .",
    "if this fails , disregard this point .",
    "we include the current mass limits from cdf , d0 @xcite , and lep ii @xcite .",
    "lep ii has produced new limits on the chargino mass , the slepton masses , the higgs boson masses , and the light top - squark mass . because the spectrum in high scale models is correlated , the cdf and d0 gluino and squark mass limits are typically irrelevant .",
    "for example , in the  gauge - mediated model , after imposing the limits on the chargino , higgs bosons , and sleptons , we find that the squark and gluino masses are larger than 260 gev .",
    "the direct search limits are 230 and 180 gev , respectively @xcite",
    ".      we can give a concise description of the overall magnitude and relevance of the supersymmetric corrections by considering the oblique approximation .",
    "most of the precision observables involve gauge boson exchange , and hence they receive universal ( i.e. process and flavor - independent ) corrections from the gauge boson self - energies . with @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 as inputs , there are three independent linear combinations of gauge - boson self - energies which appear in physical observables in the lowest order of a derivative expansion . in some cases the full corrections are dominated by the oblique corrections .",
    "this might be expected , since the oblique corrections include contributions from every non - singlet superpartner , so they are enhanced by the number of generations and/or the number of colors .",
    "the non - oblique corrections ( the fermion wave - function , vertex , and box corrections ) arise from a limited set of diagrams , since the loops are constrained by the external fermion quantum numbers .",
    "we parametrize the oblique corrections by @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "these are given by the expressions @xcite @xmath60 \\times { 4\\sin^2\\theta_w\\over\\alpha}\\nonumber\\\\ t&= & \\biggl[{\\pi_{ww}(0)\\over m_w^2 } - { \\pi_{zz}(0)\\over",

    "the most important of these parameters is @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the contributions to @xmath58 from the various supersymmetric sectors in the supergravity model .",
    "each point in the scatter plots is a best fit at the randomly chosen point in supersymmetric parameter space , as described in section  [ dmp : proc ] .",
    "3(a ) shows the chargino / neutralino contribution vs. the light chargino mass , ( b ) shows the stop / sbottom contribution vs. the heavy stop mass , ( c ) shows the slepton contribution vs. the left - handed selectron mass , and ( d ) shows the supersymmetric higgs boson contribution vs. the cp - odd higgs boson mass .",
    "we note that all the sectors give positive contributions to @xmath58 ( also to @xmath59 ) .",
    "we see that the first three sectors contribute with the same order of magnitude ( at most about 0.06 , 0.12 , and 0.07 , respectively ) . the higgs sector and",
    "the contributions of the first two generation squarks each contribute at most about 0.015 .",
    "if we add all these contributions together , we obtain the plots in fig .  4 . here",
    "we show the total supersymmetric contributions to @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 vs. the light chargino mass .",
    "the cancellation between the slepton and chargino sectors results in typically smaller values for @xmath57 .",
    "the susy contributions to @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are in the ranges ( @xmath63 ) , ( 0,0.2 ) , and ( 0,0.09 ) . for chargino masses above 300 gev the decoupling results in suppressed contributions .",
    "we illustrate the relevance of these corrections in figs .",
    ", in the @xmath58 , @xmath57 plane , we show the 68% and 95% cl contours found by varying @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath59 , with @xmath6 fixed to its best fit value , in the standard model . on top of these contours",
    "we show scatter plots of the supersymmetric contributions to @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "5(a ) the minimal supergravity scatter plot is shown , in 5(b ) the  gauge - mediated model scatter plot is shown , and the  gm model results are shown in 5(c ) . the point ( 0,0 )",
    "is a part of each supersymmetric scatter plot , since this corresponds to the decoupled region of parameter space , where @xmath8 is large .",
    "as we decrease @xmath8 , the scatter moves up and to the right or left .",
    "one can get a feeling for the overall magnitude of the supersymmetric corrections here .",
    "the direct limits on the supersymmetric mass spectrum have significantly constrained the magnitude of the supersymmetric corrections .",
    "for example , in the  gauge - mediated model the contributions to @xmath57 and @xmath58 fall almost entirely inside the 68% contour .      to rule out points in parameter space we need to consider the full one - loop supersymmetric corrections , not just the oblique corrections .",
    "the oblique approximation works well for some observables , but poorly for others .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "6 . in fig .",
    "6(a ) we show the @xmath30-boson mass vs. @xmath8 in the oblique approximation and the full one - loop result , and they are seen to be in good agreement ( here we work in the supergravity model , define @xmath64 , and set @xmath40 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "we show the correction in units of `` pull '' ( that is , we divide the correction by the experimental error ) . in fig .",
    "6(b ) we show the full and oblique @xmath65 .",
    "clearly the non - oblique corrections are significant in this case .    in the full one - loop supersymmetric analysis",
    "we have included an external constraint on the strong coupling , @xmath66 , which we obtained by combining all except the @xmath10-lineshape data @xcite .",
    "the extent of the complete one - loop corrections for each observable is shown in fig .  7 , where the horizontal lines indicate the range of values of each observable in the entire supersymmetric parameter space",
    ". the top line corresponds to the supergravity model , the middle line to the  gm model , and the bottom line to the  gm model .",
    "the small vertical line shows the value of the pull in the standard model .",
    "looking at this plot the general impression is that the supersymmetric corrections are unable to provide a significantly more satisfactory description of the data than the standard model .",
    "some of the observables are seen to be irrelevant in the fit ( i.e. @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; the supersymmetric corrections to these observables are small relative to the experimental uncertainty ) .",
    "of the observables with sizable corrections , some can reduce the sm discrepancies , ( @xmath33 , @xmath27 ) , while others can increase the sm discrepancies ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) .",
    "there are interesting correlations among the corrections to different observables .",
    "for example , the positive corrections to @xmath33 ( which reduce the sm discrepancy ) are accompanied by positive corrections to @xmath70 ( which lead to a larger discrepancy ) .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .  8 , which shows the @xmath70 pull vs. the @xmath33 pull in the supergravity model .    the minimum @xmath0 found in our random scan over parameter space is 29.6 for 19 degrees of freedom in the supergravity model . for both gm models ,",
    "we find the minimum @xmath0 values of 30.3 for 20 degrees of freedom . these correspond to goodness of fits of 5.8% and 6.5% , respectively .",
    "we can compare these numbers with the standard model goodness of fit of 10.9% .",
    "we see that the marginal reduction in @xmath0 is more than compensated for by the increase in the number of input parameters .    what we are really interested in is the set of points with large values of @xmath0 .",
    "not counting the supersymmetry parameters as fit parameters , we deem a point in supersymmetric parameter space excluded if the goodness of the fit is less than 5% . in fig .",
    "9 we show the plots of @xmath0 vs. the input parameters in the supergravity model , with @xmath3 .",
    "all points above the upper horizontal line are excluded at the 95% confidence level .",
    "10 shows the same plot with @xmath71 . with @xmath3",
    "there is significantly more parameter space ruled out .",
    "we see that in the @xmath3 ( @xmath71 ) case , there are no points excluded if @xmath72 gev , or @xmath73 gev , or @xmath74 .",
    "the excluded parameter space forms a complicated hyper - region .",
    "we plot the full one - loop @xmath0 vs. @xmath75 in the  and  gm models in fig .  11 , with @xmath3 .",
    "we see that in the  model values of @xmath76 tev are excluded . in the  case , @xmath77 tev is excluded . in the  gm model with @xmath71",
    "there are no points excluded by this analysis .",
    "we now specially consider a very important observable .",
    "the cleo measurement @xcite of the rare decay @xmath78 yields the 90% confidence interval @xmath79 .",
    "this measurement imposes a significant constraint on supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "the charged higgs loops and chargino loops give the largest contributions .",
    "the chargino contribution contains a term proportional to @xmath80 , and it can be much larger than the standard model amplitude , and can be of either sign . hence , the @xmath81 rate in supersymmetric models can be much larger or much smaller than the standard model prediction .",
    "this leads to very large values of @xmath0 in some regions of parameter space ( e.g. @xmath3 and large @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "12 , where we show the @xmath0 before and after considering the @xmath82 constraint , in the  gm model , with @xmath3 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "12(b ) that we can exclude chargino masses below @xmath2 with the @xmath83 constraint . for larger values of @xmath4 , this constraint becomes stronger .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "13 the lower bounds on the lightest neutralino and lightest chargino masses vs. @xmath4 .",
    "there are corresponding bounds on the other superpartner masses .",
    "there are no such bounds in the case @xmath71 .    in the supergravity model",
    "the @xmath82 constraint does not yield such strong limits , because the parameter space has more freedom .",
    "nevertheless , the additional region of parameter space which is excluded after including the @xmath82 measurement is significant . in particular , the @xmath3 , large @xmath4 region is severely constrained .",
    "global fits to the world s precision data provide significant constraints on supersymmetric models .",
    "we gave an encapsulated view of the supersymmetric corrections by examining the oblique set .",
    "we then indicated the amount of parameter space which is excluded based on a full one - loop analysis .",
    "we found it important to include as many observables as possible in the fit , since different models , or different regions of parameter space in a given model , are more or less sensitive to different observables .",
    "we showed the added sensitivity after including the @xmath83 measurement in the list of observables .",
    "the large @xmath4 , @xmath3 region of parameter space was shown to be severely constrained .    because the supersymmetric corrections decouple and the standard model with a light higgs boson is consistent with the data , most of the supersymmetric parameter space is consistent with the data .",
    "some regions of parameter space with light superpartners are excluded , but , on the other hand , there are points in parameter space with very light particles which are consistent with the data .",
    "in fact , the point in the supergravity model parameter space with the smallest @xmath0 in our scan includes a light right - handed top - squark ( 55 gev ) .",
