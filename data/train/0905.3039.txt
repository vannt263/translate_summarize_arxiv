    "dark matter makes up most of the matter in the universe , but its identity is unknown . so far , dark matter has been observed only through its gravitational interactions . a logical possibility , then , is that dark matter is hidden , that is , neutral under all standard model ( sm ) gauge interactions .",
    "this possibility has been explored for many years  @xcite and brings with it a great deal of model building freedom .",
    "unfortunately , this freedom is generically accompanied not only by a loss of predictivity , but also by the loss of appealing features common to other dark matter candidates , such as the strong connections to central problems in particle physics , such as the gauge hierarchy and flavor problems , and the naturally correct thermal relic density of weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "in this work , we consider the possibility that hidden dark matter is charged under an _ exact _",
    "u(1 ) gauge symmetry in the hidden sector .",
    "we assume the hidden sector is truly hidden , with no `` connector '' particles charged under both sm and hidden gauge groups .",
    "although many of our results are relevant for any charged hidden dark matter , including cases with connectors or massive hidden photons , we are particularly motivated by the framework of wimpless dark matter  @xcite , which ameliorates some of the problems of hidden dark matter noted above .",
    "( for other recent discussions of hidden dark matter charged under exact gauge symmetries , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in this framework , dark matter is hidden , but additional structure implies that it nevertheless naturally has the correct thermal relic density . in the examples studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , the dark matter is in a hidden sector of supersymmetric models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) .",
    "assuming that supersymmetry is broken in a single sector , the hidden sector mass scale @xmath2 and gauge couplings @xmath3 are related to the observable sector weak scale @xmath4 and gauge coupling @xmath5 by @xmath6 this implies that the thermal relic density of wimpless dark matter , @xmath7 , and so is naturally of the desired magnitude , even though @xmath2 need not be at the weak scale .",
    "the wimpless framework also has other virtues , including that fact that it is naturally consistent with an elegant solution to the new physics flavor problem , since the gravitino mass , and with it all dangerous flavor - violating gravity - mediated effects , satisfies @xmath8 .",
    "this contrasts with the case of neutralino dark matter , where stability of the neutralino @xmath9 requires @xmath10 .",
    "other gmsb dark matter candidates have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , it is notable that the relation @xmath11 results directly from the desire to generate a flavor - blind superpartner spectrum .",
    "wimpless dark matter therefore not only dissolves the tension between dark matter and the flavor problem in supersymmetry , but it exploits an elegant solution of the supersymmetric flavor problem to predict the correct thermal relic density .",
    "assuming @xmath12 , however , how is the stability of the hidden sector candidate maintained ?",
    "although there are many possibilities in the wimpless framework  @xcite , an elegant possibility is that the dark matter is charged under an exact gauge symmetry in the hidden sector .",
    "the dark matter candidate may then be stable for the same reason that the electron is stable  its decay is prevented by charge conservation .",
    "we are therefore led rather straightforwardly to the possibility of charged dark matter in a hidden sector . in the following sections",
    ", we will consider , as a concrete example , a minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)-like hidden sector with @xmath13 yukawa couplings . the massless hidden particles  the hidden photon , gluon , and neutrinos  are then all neutral under hidden @xmath14 .",
    "any charged particle in the hidden sector , for example , the hidden @xmath15 , chargino , stau , tau , or charged higgs boson , would then be stable , provided it was the lightest @xmath2 particle .",
    "a particularly plausible choice is the lighter stau @xmath16 , whose mass receives smaller susy - breaking contributions than other hidden superparticles .",
    "this possibility of charged hidden dark matter requires a rethinking of many issues in cosmology , as its properties differ markedly from the more conventional possibility of neutral dark matter . in this work , we analyze these issues comprehensively to establish the viability of the scenario and determine what ranges of parameters are allowed .",
    "because the dark matter is charged , it may form bound states and then annihilate in the early universe .",
    "dark matter annihilation is also enhanced by the sommerfeld effect  @xcite .",
    "the formation of bound states and the sommerfeld effect are possible also in the standard model ; for example , bound state formation impacts @xmath17 annihilation to 511 kev photons at late times when the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are non - relativistic . in the present case , both effects may reduce the thermal relic density , potentially destroying the nice relic density property of wimpless dark matter .",
    "after chemical freeze out , the dark matter s charge also plays an important role in kinetic decoupling , since charged dark matter may be far more efficiently coupled to the thermal bath of hidden photons through compton scattering than neutral dark matter .",
    "this impacts the matter power spectrum , requiring a modification of the standard wimp analysis  @xcite .",
    "this also changes the expected minimum mass of dark matter halos .",
    "it is important to check the minimum halo mass because the sommerfeld enhancement charged dark matter annihilation is most effective in the least massive halos where relative velocities are the smallest , and this effect has been noted to provide a stringent constraint on the possibility of charged dark matter  @xcite .",
    "finally , the existence of a long range force between dark matter particles implies dark matter is collisional .",
    "it is therefore also critical to investigate whether this scenario is consistent with constraints on self - interacting dark matter from the bullet cluster  @xcite , observed ellipticity of dark matter halos  @xcite and bounds from considerations of galactic dynamics  @xcite .    in the end",
    ", we will find that all of these constraints are satisfied for reasonable model parameters , and are consistent with the correct relic density for dark matter masses in the range @xmath20 .",
    "these dark matter candidates are therefore viable , sharing many of the theoretical virtues of wimps , but predicting drastically different features for astrophysics . in its minimal form",
    ", this model also predicts no direct detection , indirect detection , and collider signals .",
    "if desired , however , with the addition of connector sectors , the charged hidden dark matter model we consider here may also have implications for direct searches , indirect searches , and particle colliders .",
    "some of these implications have been considered previously  @xcite , and others are possible  @xcite .",
    "we will not expand on these possibilities here , other than to note that our results show that an exact hidden @xmath14 is possible , leading to a simple framework in which annihilation rates are enhanced by the pure sommerfeld effect .",

    "@xcite , we consider a hidden sector that is mssm - like , with gauge group @xmath21 , but with only one generation of fermions and @xmath13 yukawa couplings .",
    "it is important that the model be chiral , so that hidden electroweak symmetry breaking sets the scale for the masses and the naturally correct thermal relic density is realized . of course",
    ", the model should also be anomaly - free .",
    "the one - generation mssm is a relatively simple model that satisfies these criteria , and has the advantage that one can apply much of the intuition built up from studies of the usual mssm .",
    "many other choices are possible , however , and would also be worth further study . assuming electroweak symmetry breaking that leaves @xmath22 preserved in the hidden sector , the particle masses in the hidden sector are @xmath23 where we have used third - generation notation for the hidden ( s)quarks and ( s)leptons to remind us that they have @xmath13 yukawa couplings . from this spectrum",
    ", a natural possibility is that the lightest weak scale particle is charged , and therefore stabilized by @xmath14 charge conservation in the hidden sector . as noted in sec .",

    "this dependence is very important . in high energy processes , such as thermal freeze out , both em and weak processes are effective .",
    "in low energy processes , such as those occurring at present , only em interactions mediated by the massless @xmath34 are important .",
    "if there were no hidden weak interactions , for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath31 , @xmath59 would fix @xmath57 , and so the relic density would fix the strength of dark matter self - interactions now . in the more general case we are considering , however , one can keep @xmath60 constant for arbitrarily small @xmath57 , provided @xmath54 is large enough .",
    "as noted above , we will consider @xmath54 as large as 10 ; larger values are , of course , also possible .",
    "in the standard cosmology , structure formation is hierarchical , that is , small objects form first and progressively the larger objects form via mergers and accretion .",
    "the mass of the smallest dark matter halo is determined by the dark matter particle s mass and the temperature at which it kinetically decouples from the other light particle species . for a typical wimp with electroweak scale mass ,",
    "the kinetic decoupling temperature ranges roughly from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , which leads to the formation of dark matter halos with masses as small as @xmath63 to @xmath64  @xcite . for other dark matter particles , such as weak - scale gravitinos or mev dark matter",
    ", the minimum mass dark matter halo could be as large as the smallest dwarf galaxies  @xcite .",
    "some regions of the parameter space of these models are excluded because the predicted minimum mass halo is in conflict with observations .    in this section ,",
    "we analyze the kinetic decoupling of hidden charged dark matter . one notable difference between the wimp and hidden charged dark matter",
    "is that the charged dark matter interacts not only through weak interactions , but also through em interactions . for the case of @xmath24 dark matter",
    ", this implies that the dark matter remains in kinetic contact not only through the weak process @xmath65 , but also through the compton scattering process @xmath66 .",
    "as we will see , at low temperatures , the thermally - averaged weak cross section is suppressed by @xmath67 , but this suppression is absent for compton scattering , creating a large , qualitative difference between this case and the canonical wimp scenario .",
    "note also that , in principle , in the case of charged dark matter , bound state formation also impacts kinetic decoupling . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : boundstate ] , however , very few staus actually bind , and so this effect is not significant and may be neglected in our analysis .",

    "the contribution from compton scattering ( the first term ) does not suffer the @xmath82 suppression typical of weak interactions . therefore , for @xmath83 , compton scattering dominates the contribution to @xmath80 .",
    "however , for @xmath84 , the @xmath35 channel is enhanced dramatically and dominates for @xmath85 .",
    "we define the kinetic decoupling temperature as the temperature where the momentum transfer rate and the hubble expansion rate become equal , that is , @xmath86 .",
    "( for other possible definitions , see , for example , refs .  @xcite . ) here we adopt the hidden sector point of view and write the hubble parameter as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the total effective relativistic degrees of freedom , and @xmath39 is the visible sector s photon temperature .",
    "we assume there is no thermal contact between hidden and observable sectors , and so the visible sector enters the analysis only through the contribution of its effective degrees of freedom @xmath89 to the expansion rate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tkd ] we show the hidden sector kinetic decoupling temperature @xmath90 and visible sector kinetic decoupling temperature @xmath91 as functions of @xmath2 for various combinations of @xmath92 .",

    "this case is thus similar to the standard wimp case , except that the hidden dark matter is charged . for the wimp case ,",
    "one typically finds @xmath97 , as noted above , whereas in this charged hidden dark matter case , we find that @xmath98 .",
    "we see that the presence of compton scattering does in fact have a large impact , keeping the charged dark matter in kinetic equilibrium to much lower temperatures .",
    "this effect is moderated for other values of @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath99 , the hidden sector is colder relative to the visible sector . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a colder hidden sector requires a smaller @xmath57 to meet the relic abundance constraint , which results in a smaller momentum transfer rate .",
    "furthermore , for a colder hidden sector , the visible sector appears hotter .",
    "the resulting larger hubble expansion rate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubble ] ) also causes the momentum transfer processes to become inefficient earlier .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced for @xmath100 , since large @xmath54 implies even lower @xmath57 , increasing the visible sector @xmath91 further .",
    "the interactions and subsequent decoupling of dark matter particles damp the matter power spectrum .",
    "the matter power spectrum is the fourier transform of the two - point function of the cosmological density fluctuations in matter . for gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "this encodes all the relevant information for linear perturbation theory . in this section",
    ", we will study the power spectrum of hidden charged dark matter to contrast its predictions with that of canonical wimp models .",
    "we will focus on small scales where differences might be expected , especially in the predictions for the mass of the smallest dark matter structures that can form .",
    "we will find that the differences from the usual wimp models are not observable with current data , although these may be observable in the future .",
    "however , the smallest halo mass prediction is important for the calculation of sommerfeld - enhanced self - annihilations , which we will discuss in the following section .",
    "the damping due to the coupling of charged dark matter to hidden sector photons ( and neutrinos ) results from two distinct processes .",
    "the coupling of the dark matter to the hidden sector photons and neutrinos leads to damped oscillatory features  @xcite due to the interplay between the gravity of dark matter and the pressure of the photons .",
    "this is the dominant effect for the case of wimps with electroweak scale masses and also for our case with @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , after decoupling , the free - streaming of the dark matter particles further suppresses the power spectrum .",
    "this effect dominates at lower masses and in particular in the region of parameter space where interactions with the hidden sector neutrinos dominate over those with hidden sector photons .",
    "the presence of the hidden sector and the coupling of the dark matter to @xmath34 and @xmath35 make the decoupling and matter power spectrum calculation different from the standard wimp case .",
    "the two main differences are the following . in the standard wimp case ,",
    "the wimp couples to standard model fermions that are part of a tightly coupled ( collisionally - coupled ) fluid .",
    "this implies that multipole moments of the density fluctuations higher than the dipole are strongly suppressed .",
    "this result stems from the fact that in a collisionally - coupled plasma , a quadrupole anisotropy pattern can only develop if there is significant diffusion . in the present case , the hidden sector photons and neutrinos are only coupled to the dark matter and are able to diffuse significantly .",
    "we therefore need to track their density fluctuations to higher multipoles .",
    "the other notable difference is that the expansion rate is predominantly set by the visible sector matter and so the ratio of the scattering rate in the hidden sector to expansion rate is different from the usual wimp case .",
    "we provide details about this calculation in app .",
    "[ sec : app ] .     as functions of @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the conformal time .",

    "[ fig : delta ] we show the normalized density fluctuations for different modes as functions of @xmath105 , where @xmath103 is the conformal time .",
    "the coupling between @xmath24 and @xmath34 results in damped oscillations as mentioned previously , and this is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] for the modes that enter the horizon before kinetic decoupling .",
    "however , there is one major difference between this hidden sector scenario and the wimp scenario studied in refs .",
    "@xcite : the oscillation amplitude is much smaller than it is in the wimp case .",
    "this traces back to the @xmath106 scattering cross section , which is @xmath107 , that is , set by the sm weak scale , which is far smaller than the analogous visible sector cross section , which is the thomson cross section @xmath108 .",

    "<S> can dark matter be stabilized by charge conservation , just as the electron is in the standard model ? </S>",
    "<S> we examine the possibility that dark matter is hidden , that is , neutral under all standard model gauge interactions , but charged under an exact u(1 ) gauge symmetry of the hidden sector . </S>",
    "<S> such candidates are predicted in wimpless models , supersymmetric models in which hidden dark matter has the desired thermal relic density for a wide range of masses . </S>",
    "<S> hidden charged dark matter has many novel properties not shared by neutral dark matter : ( 1 ) bound state formation and sommerfeld - enhanced annihilation after chemical freeze out may reduce its relic density , ( 2 ) similar effects greatly enhance dark matter annihilation in protohalos at redshifts of @xmath0 , ( 3 ) compton scattering off hidden photons delays kinetic decoupling , suppressing small scale structure , and ( 4 ) rutherford scattering makes such dark matter self - interacting and collisional , potentially impacting properties of the bullet cluster and the observed morphology of galactic halos . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze all of these effects in a wimpless model in which the hidden sector is a simplified version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and the dark matter is a hidden sector stau . </S>",
    "<S> we find that charged hidden dark matter is viable and consistent with the correct relic density for reasonable model parameters and dark matter masses in the range @xmath1 . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , in the preferred range of parameters , this model predicts cores in the dark matter halos of small galaxies and other halo properties that may be within the reach of future observations . </S>",
    "<S> these models therefore provide a viable and well - motivated framework for collisional dark matter with sommerfeld enhancement , with novel implications for astrophysics and dark matter searches . </S>"
