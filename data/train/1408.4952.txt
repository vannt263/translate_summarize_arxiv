    "the motion of a spinning test particle in a given gravitational background in the context of general relativity is described by the so called mathisson - papapetrou model @xcite completed with the dixon - tulczyjew @xcite supplementary conditions , under which the trajectory of the extended body is determined by an associated reference world line used for a multipole reduction . solving the resulting equations is in general a rather difficult task even for highly symmetric spacetimes , due to the complicate features of the forces associated with the non - geodesic motion .",
    "the latter imply deviation from geodesic motion , which can be analytically discussed in very special contexts ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , where a plane gravitational wave is taken as the background spacetime ) .",
    "the simplest approach consists in performing purely numerical studies of the full nonlinear equations @xcite .",
    "otherwise one can search for analytic solutions which describe particle motion constrained along killing trajectories , e.g. circular orbits @xcite , also in the ultrarelativistic regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lyapunov stability in these cases has been investigated , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we follow a different approach to the problem , taking advantage of the condition of  small spin \" which is implicit in the model .",
    "in fact , in order to neglect the particle back reaction on the background spacetime the length scale naturally associated with the spin should be very small compared to the one associated with the curvature tensor of the spacetime itself . introducing this smallness condition from the very beginning leads to a simplified set of linearized differential equations which can be analytically integrated at least in some special cases @xcite .",
    "we investigate the deviation of the path of a spinning particle from a general geodesic in the kerr spacetime , generalizing previous results of ref .",
    "@xcite , whose analysis was limited to the case of circular geodesic motion on the equatorial plane taken as the reference path .",
    "the linearized set of equations in the spin variables as well as in the deviation vector components with initial conditions for geodesic motion leads to solutions for which the deviations are entirely due to the spin - curvature force .",
    "it proves convenient to introduce an adapted orthonormal frame which is parallely propagated along the reference timelike geodesic congruence . in fact , the frame components of the spin orientation vector are constant and the covariant derivative of the displacement vector simply becomes an ordinary derivative with respect to the proper time along the geodesic path .",
    "such a frame was found by marck @xcite , who showed how to identify one leg of the associated spatial triad directly from the killing - yano tensor .",
    "therefore , we start with a short review of marck s construction of the parallel transported frame by evidentiating its geometrical properties .",
    "we then consider a sample of geodesics and study the evolution of the components of the deviation vector as well as the features of the perturbed orbits .",
    "in the case of equatorial circular geodesic studied in ref .",
    "@xcite the spinning particle position for a given spin orientation oscillates about the keplerian orbit with ( a combination of ) the proper radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies .",
    "the features of motion change significantly when non - circular and non - equatorial geodesics are considered as the reference path .",
    "the set of mathisson - papapetrou - dixon ( mpd ) equations to first order in spin is given by @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the timelike unit tangent vector to the `` center of mass line '' for the spinning particle used to perform a multipole reduction , @xmath2 is the proper time parameter along @xmath1 , @xmath3 is the associated 4-acceleration , @xmath4^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}u_{\\nu}u_{\\sigma}$ ] is a spatial trace - free tensor orthogonal to @xmath1 referred to as the magnetic part of the riemann tensor with respect to @xmath1 , which in vacuum is also symmetric .",
    "@xmath5 is a spacelike unit vector determining the spin orientation .",
    "the total 4-momentum @xmath6 of the particle is aligned with @xmath1 in this limit , i.e. @xmath7 , with the mass @xmath8 of the particle remaining constant along the path .",
    "the magnitude @xmath9 of the spin vector @xmath10 is also a constant of motion and appears in the equations only through the specific spin angular momentum ratio @xmath11 ( so that @xmath12 has the dimensions of a length ) .",
    "consider now a pair of world lines with approximately the same initial data , one a geodesic with 4-velocity @xmath13 , the other a world line of a spinning particle which deviates from the geodesic because of the combined effects of geodesic deviation and the spin - curvature coupling , with 4-velocity @xmath1 .",
    "solutions of the equation of motion to first order in the spin can then be found in the general form [ uspindef ] u = u_(g ) + y .",
    "moreover , the normalization condition @xmath14 ( to first order in spin ) constrains @xmath15 so that yu_(g)=0 , synchronizing the proper times to first order , implying that @xmath2 can be used unambiguously for that single proper time parametrization of both world lines",
    ". furthermore , this implies that to first order in the spin , the spin orientation vector @xmath5 is parallely propagated along @xmath13 .",
    "when the background spacetime admits a nontrivial killing - yano tensor @xmath16 , such a vector @xmath5 can be directly obtained from @xmath16 , as shown by marck @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the coordinate displacement @xmath17 associated with @xmath18 such that [ pertorb ] x^()= x_(g)^(_(g))+^(_(g ) ) , with = u^ , = y^. the 4-acceleration @xmath19 to first order in spin turns out to be given by @xmath20\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denote the christoffel symbols evaluated at @xmath22 .",
    "introducing then the covariant derivative of @xmath23 along @xmath13 , i.e. = + _ ( g)^_^u_(g)^ , and taking the covariant derivative of this expression along @xmath13 gives @xmath24\\xi^\\alpha u_{\\rm ( g)}^\\beta u_{\\rm ( g)}^\\gamma\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denote the riemann tensor components evaluated at @xmath22 .",

    "the equations of motion ( [ papcoreqs1iord ] ) are thus summarized by [ eqmoton ] + e(u_(g))^_^=-h(u_(g))^ n_. in order to solve this set of equations it is convenient to introduce a parallel propagated frame along @xmath13 , implying that the covariant derivatives simply become ordinary derivatives with respect to the proper time and the components of the spin orientation vector in that frame are constant .",
    "one may also consider a bunch of spinning particles with different spin @xmath9 and all surrounding a single geodesic .",
    "deviations from each pair are measured by [ dev2 ] x_1^()-x_2^()=(_1-_2)^(_(g ) ) , u_1 ^ - u_2^= ( _ 1-_2)y^.    from eq .",
    "( [ eqmoton ] ) it follows that both the displacement vector @xmath23 and the deviation vector @xmath15 do not depend on the value of @xmath9 ( or @xmath12 ) .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ) the deviations due to spin remain small for a large interval of proper time , and exhibit an oscillating behavior with specific frequencies analytically determined in ref .",
    "as expected from the presence of a secular drift term in the solution for the perturbed azimuthal motion , the magnitude of the oscillations increases with time , but very slowly , as shown in panel ( d ) , where the behavior of the magnitude of the displacement vector is plotted as a function of the proper time . as a consequence ,",
    "the perturbed orbit remains quasi - circular and quasi - equatorial even after many revolutions .    if the reference orbit is still an equatorial geodesic , but non - circular as in figs .",
    "[ fig:2][fig:4 ] , the situation can be quite different .",
    "for instance , in the case of the spiraling orbit of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the deviations are more enhanced approaching the horizon due to the increasing of the spin - curvature force there .",
    "the initial oscillatory behavior of the deviation vector components is lost soon ( see panel ( c ) ) , and just after a few revolutions the magnitude of the displacement vector increases of about 2 orders of magnitude , so that the perturbed orbit is very different from the reference one , as shown in panel ( a ) . in the case of the escape orbit of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we still have increasing deviations when the path is close to the hole , but these become less and less enhanced asymptotically far from the hole where the spin - curvature force vanishes . as a consequence ,",
    "the perturbed orbit mostly remains close to the geodesic path . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we have considered an equatorial non - circular geodesic with a rosetta - like \" path . as in the circular case",
    "we see oscillations in the variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 , but now with a not well defined periodicity . the perturbed orbit still remains close enough to the geodesic .",
    "the case of non - equatorial reference geodesics has been investigated in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we have selected a spherical geodesic .",
    "the components of the deviation vector are initially highly suppressed , but after a few revolutions they start increasing rapidly leading to a spiraling motion towards the horizon .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] refers to a general non - equatorial non - circular geodesic starting from the equatorial plane with enough energy and angular momentum to escape after a few loops around the hole .",
    "this situation exhibits both features of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] : the deviation vector components are initially very small , then increase to high values when the orbit passes close to the hole . during the escape",
    "far from the hole they practically stop increasing reaching asymptotic constant values .",
    "however , the magnitude of the displacement vector is big enough so that the perturbed orbit turns out to be very different from the reference one even for small spin .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of extended spinning bodies in the kerr spacetime in the pole - dipole particle approximation and under the assumption that the actual motion slightly deviates from the geodesic path . as usual , the spin parameter is assumed to be very small in order to ignore the back reaction on the spacetime geometry ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion on the validity of this approximation ) .",
    "this approach naturally leads to solve the mathisson - papapetrou - dixon equations linearized in the spin variables as well as in the deviation vector , with initial conditions for geodesic motion . even if there exist a number of papers discussing the dynamics of extended spinning bodies in kerr spacetime , these are but related to special situations or involve fully numerical treatments . the novel contribution of the present paper concerns the choice of the reference path , which is here a fully general non - equatorial and non - circular timelike geodesic , allowing to go beyond previous results limited to the very special case of deviations from an equatorial circular geodesic .",
    "the deviations from geodesic motion has been estimated by analyzing the behavior of the components of the deviation vector as well as the magnitude of the displacement vector as functions of the proper time along the reference path . as a general feature , even for small values of the spin parameter",
    "the deviations tend to grow with time , so that the difference between the path of a spinning particle and the reference geodesic becomes significant when measured after a time interval large enough .",
    "we have then considered different kinds of reference geodesics , including non - circular equatorial orbits , orbits along the rotation axis and spherical orbits .",
    "the case of polar geodesics in the schwarzschild spacetime has been analytically solved , providing explicit expressions for radial shift and node advance of the resulting perturbed orbit .",
