    "kardar , parisi and zhang ( kpz )  @xcite proposed on physical grounds that a wide variety of irreversible stochastically growing interfaces should be governed by a single stochastic pde ( with two model dependent parameters @xmath8 ) .",
    "namely , let @xmath9 be the height function at time @xmath10 and position @xmath11 , then the kpz equation is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a local noise term modeled by space - time white noise .",
    "since then , it has been of significant interest to make mathematical sense of this spde ( which is ill - posed due to the non - linearity ) and to find the solutions for large growth time @xmath10 .",
    "significant progress has been made towards understanding this equation in the one - dimensional @xmath14 case .",
    "specifically , it is believed that the dynamical scaling exponent is @xmath0 .",
    "this should mean that for any growth model ( also polymer models ) in the same universality class as the kpz equation ( i.e. , the kpz universality class ) , after centering @xmath15 by its asymptotic value @xmath16 and rescaling as large parameter .",
    "in the literature also the choice @xmath17 and @xmath18 is used . ]",
    "@xmath19 the limit of @xmath20 should exist ( as @xmath4 ) and be independent of @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the limit should , regardless of microscopic differences in the original models , converge to the same space - time process .",
    "most of the rigorous work to infinity have been derived , first in the problem of tagged particle in the tasep  @xcite , and then in more general models  @xcite .",
    "however , the different times are restricted to lie in an interval of width @xmath22 . ] done in studying the statistics associated with this fixed point have dealt with the spatial process ( obtained as the asymptotic statistics of @xmath23 as a process in @xmath24 , as @xmath4 ) and not on how the spatial process evolves with @xmath25 .",
    "the exact form of these statistics depend only on the type of initial geometry of the growth process ( e.g. , the @xmath26 process for non - random flat geometries and @xmath27 process for wedge geometries ; see the review  @xcite ) .",
    "computations of exact statistics require a level of solvability and thus have only been proved in the context of certain solvable discrete growth models or polymer models in the kpz universality class . the partially / totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( p / tasep )",
    ", last passage percolation ( lpp ) with exponential or geometric weights , the corner growth model , and polynuclear growth ( png ) model constitute those models for which rigorous spatial fluctuation results have been proved .",
    "recently , progress was made on analyzing the solution of the kpz equation itself @xcite , though this still relied on the approximation of the kpz equation by a solvable discrete model .",
    "the slow decorrelation phenomenon provides one of the strongest pieces of evidence that the above scaling is correct .",
    "indeed , slow decorrelation means that @xmath28 converges to zero in probability for any @xmath7 .",
    "fix @xmath29 times of the form @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "then , as long as @xmath7 , the height function fluctuations , scaled by @xmath3 and considered in a spatial scale of @xmath33 , will be asympotically ( as @xmath34 ) the same as those at time @xmath35 .",
    "specifically , we introduce a generalized lpp model which encompasses several kpz class models .",
    "then we give sufficient conditions under which such lpp models display slow decorrelation .",
    "these conditions ( the existence of a limit shape and one - point fluctuation result ) are very elementary and hold for all the solvable models already mentioned , and are believed to hold for all kpz class models .",
    "the proof that slow decorrelation follows from these two conditions is very simple  it relies on the superadditivity property of lpp and on the simple observation that if @xmath36 and both @xmath37 and @xmath38 converge in law to the same random variable , then @xmath39 converges in probability to zero ( see lemma  [ bac_lemma ] ) .",
    "previously , the slow decorrelation phenomenon was proved for the png model  @xcite .",
    "therein the proof is based on very sharp estimates known in the literature only for the png .",
    "apart from the png , the only other model for which slow decorrelation has been proved is tasep under the assumption of stationary initial distribution  @xcite .    besides being of conceptual interest , the slow decorrelation phenomenon is an important technical tool that allows one to , for instance : ( a ) easily translate limit process results between different related observables ( e.g. , total current , height function representation , particle positions in tasep ; see  @xcite ) , and more importantly , ( b ) prove limit theorems beyond the situations where the correlation functions are known @xcite ( see section  [ corner_growth_model_sec ] ) .",
    "a further application is in extending known process limit results to prove similar results for more general initial conditions / boundary conditions @xcite .      in section  [ gen_theory_sec ]",
    "we introduce the general framework for lpp models in which we prove a set of criteria for slow decorrelation ( theorem  [ growth_thm ] ) . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we apply theorem  [ growth_thm ] to various models in the kpz class , which can be related in some way with a lpp model : the corner growth model , point to point and point to line lpp models , tasep , pasep ( which requires a slightly different argument since it can not be directly mapped to a lpp problem ) and png models .",
    "finally we note extensions of the theorem to first passage percolation and directed polymers , provided that ( as conjectured ) the same criteria are satisfied .",
    "the authors wish to thank jinho baik for early discussions about this and related problems .",
    "i. corwin wishes to thank the organizers of the `` random maps and graphs on surfaces '' conference at the institut henri poincar , as much of this work was done during that stay .",

    "in this section we consider a general class of last passage percolation models ( or equivalently growth models ) . given the existence of a law of large numbers ( lln ) and central limit theorem ( clt ) for last passage time ( or for the associated height function ) , we prove that such models display slow decorrelation along their specific , model dependent , `` characteristic '' directions .",
    "we consider growth models in @xmath40 for @xmath41 which may be lattice based or driven by poisson point processes .",
    "we define a directed lpp model to be an almost surely sigma - finite random non - negative measure @xmath42 on @xmath40",
    ". for example we could take @xmath42 to be a collection of delta masses at every point of @xmath43 with weights given by random variables ( which need not be independent or identically distributed ) .",
    "alternatively we could have a poisson point process such as in the lpp realization of the png model .",
    "we will focus on a statistic we call the _ directed half - line to point last passage time_. we choose to study this since , by specifying different distributions on the random measure @xmath42 one can recover statistics for a variety of kpz class models . in order to define this passage time we introduce the half - line @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 coordinate of the point @xmath47 .",
    "[ c]@xmath48 [ l]@xmath10 [ l]@xmath47 [ l]@xmath49 [ c]@xmath50   and the space and time axis are label .",
    "a directed path @xmath49 from @xmath51 to the point @xmath47 is shown.,title=\"fig:\",height=170 ]    it is convenient for us to define a second coordinate system which we call the space - time coordinate system as follows : let @xmath52 be the rotation matrix which takes @xmath51 to @xmath53 . then the space - time coordinate system is @xmath54 applied to the standard basis .",
    "the line @xmath55 ( which contains @xmath51 ) is the inverse image of @xmath56 and we call it the @xmath10-axis ( for `` time '' ) , see figure  [ slow_dec_space_time ] for an illustration .",
    "the other space - time axes are labeled @xmath57 through @xmath58 ( these are considered to be `` space '' axes ) .",
    "call a curve @xmath49 in @xmath40 a directed path if @xmath59 is a function of @xmath10 and is 1-lipschitz .",
    "two points are called `` time - like '' if they can be connected by such a path .",
    "otherwise they are called `` space - like '' .    to a directed path",
    "we assign a passage time @xmath60 which is the measure , under the random measure @xmath42 of the curve @xmath49 .",
    "now we define the last passage time from the half - line @xmath51 to a point @xmath47 as @xmath61 where we understand the supremum as being over all directed paths starting from the half - line and going to @xmath47",
    ". one may also consider point to point last passage time between @xmath47 and @xmath62 which we write as @xmath63 .",
    "this is the special case of @xmath64 on @xmath65 .    in section  [ apps ]",
    "we show how , by specifying the random measure @xmath42 differently , this model encompasses a wide variety of lpp models and related processes ( such as tasep and png ) . just to illustrate though , take @xmath14 and let @xmath42 be composed of only delta masses at points @xmath47 in @xmath66 with mass @xmath67 exponentially distributed with rate 1",
    ". then @xmath68 is the last passage time for the usual lpp in a corner ( or equivalently the corner growth model considered in section  [ corner_growth_model_sec ] ) .",
    "we present our result in this more general framework to allow for non - lattice models such as the png model .    we can now state a result showing that _ slow decorrelation occurs _ in any model which can be phrased in terms of this type of last passage percolation model _ provided both a lln and a clt hold_.    [ growth_thm ] fix a last passage model in dimension @xmath69 with @xmath41 by specifying the distributions of the random variables which make up the environment . consider a point @xmath70 and a time - like direction @xmath71 . if there exist constants ( depending on @xmath47 , @xmath72 , and the model ) : @xmath73 and @xmath74 non - negative ; @xmath75 ; @xmath76 ; distributions @xmath77 , @xmath78 ; and scaling constants @xmath79 such that @xmath80 then we have slow decorrelation of the half - line to point last passage time at @xmath81 , in the direction @xmath72 and with scaling exponent @xmath82 , which is to say that for all @xmath83 , @xmath84    [ non_const_remark ] there are many generalizations of this result whose proofs are very similar . for instance",
    "the fixed ( macroscopic ) point @xmath47 and the fixed direction @xmath72 can , in fact , vary with @xmath10 as long as they converge as @xmath85 .",
    "one may also think of the random lpp measure @xmath42 ( and the associated probability space @xmath86 ) as depending on @xmath10 .",
    "thus for each @xmath10 the lpp environment is given by @xmath87 defined on the space @xmath88 .",
    "the probability @xmath89 will therefore also depend on @xmath10 , however an inspection of the proof below shows that the whole theorem still holds with @xmath89 replaced by @xmath90 .",
    "recall the super - additivity property : @xmath91 which holds provided the last passage times are defined on the same probability space .",
    "this follows from the fact that , by restricting the set of paths which contribute to @xmath92 to only those which go through the point @xmath81 , one can only decrease the last passage time .",
    "the following lemma plays a central role in our proof .",
    "[ bac_lemma ] consider two sequences of random variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 such that for each @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are defined on the same probability space @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath99 and @xmath100 as well as @xmath101 then @xmath102 converges to zero in probability .",
    "conversely if @xmath101 and @xmath102 converges to zero in probability then @xmath100 as well .    from now on , we assume that the different last passage times @xmath103 and @xmath104 are realized on the same probability space . also ,",
    "by absorbing the constants @xmath105 and @xmath106 into the distributions , we may fix them to be equal to one .",
    "using super - additivity we may write @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a ( compensator ) random variable . rewriting the above equation in terms of the random variables @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 and dividing by @xmath112 we are left with @xmath113 by assumption on @xmath82 , @xmath114 and hence we know that the distribution of @xmath110 and separately of @xmath115 converge to the same distribution @xmath77 . however , since @xmath116 is always non - negative , we also know that @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , by lemma  [ bac_lemma ] their difference , @xmath116 , converges to zero in probability .",
    "thus @xmath118 converges to zero in probability . since @xmath119 the theorem immediately follows .",
    "the aim of this section is to make a non - exhaustive review of the possible fields of applications of theorem  [ growth_thm ] .",
    "we introduce a few standard models and explain , briefly , how they fit into the framework of half - line to point lpp and what the consequences of theorem  [ growth_thm ] are for these models .",
    "consider a set @xmath120 in @xmath121 with initial condition @xmath122 and evolving under the following dynamics : from each _ outer corner _ of @xmath120 a @xmath123-box is fill at rate one ( i.e. , after exponentially distributed waiting time of mean @xmath124 ) .",
    "see figure  [ corner_fig ] for an illustration of this growth rule where the model has been rotated by @xmath125 .",
    "[ cb]@xmath24 [ c]@xmath48 [ c]@xmath126 [ c]@xmath127 [ c]@xmath128 [ c]@xmath129 [ c]@xmath130 [ c]@xmath131 [ c]@xmath132   are the random , exponentially distributed times it takes to fill an outer corner .",
    "the black line is the height function at time @xmath133 .",
    "there are two outer corners at that time.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]      this random variable is well known to define a last passage time in a related directed percolation model , as we now recall .",
    "let @xmath136 be the waiting time for the outer corner @xmath137 to be filled , once it appears .",
    "a path @xmath49 from @xmath138 to @xmath139 is called directed if it moves either up or to the right along lattice edges from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "to each such path @xmath49 , one associates a passage time @xmath140 .",
    "then @xmath141 i.e. , @xmath142 is the last passage times from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "alternatively one can keep track of @xmath120 in terms of a height function @xmath15 defined by the relationship @xmath143 ( together with linear interpolation for non - integer values of @xmath144 ) .",
    "note that for given @xmath10 , @xmath145 for @xmath146 large enough .",
    "thus the corner growth process is equivalent to the stochastic evolution of a height function @xmath147 with @xmath148 and growing according to the rule that local valleys ( @xmath149 ) are replaced by local hills ( @xmath150 ) at rate one .",
    "we will speak mostly about the height function , but when it comes to computing and proving theorems it is often easier to deal with the last passage picture .",
    "if we more generally consider the height function arising from a lpp model with an ergodic measure ( e.g. , iid random lattice weights ) , then super - additivity and the kingman s ergodic theorem implies the existence of a ( possibly infinity ) limit growth evolution @xmath152 since lpp is a variation problem , the limiting profile is also given by the solution to a variational problem which , when translated into the limiting height function means that @xmath153 satisfies a hamilton - jacobi pde @xmath154 for a model dependent flux function @xmath155 . such pdes may have multiple solutions , and @xmath153 corresponds to the unique weak solutions subject to entropy conditions .",
    "such pdes can be solved via the method of characteristics  @xcite .",
    "characteristics are lines of slope @xmath156 along which initial data for @xmath153 is transported . in our present case",
    "if we set @xmath157 then @xmath158 satisfies the burgers equation @xmath159 and the characteristic lines are of constant velocity emanating out of the origin .",
    "it is the fluctuations around this macroscopic profile which are believed to be universal .",
    "johansson  @xcite proved that asymptotic one - point fluctuations are given by @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the @xmath162 tracy - widom distribution defined in @xcite . unlike the traditional clt the fluctuations here are in the order of @xmath3 and the limiting distribution is not gaussian .",
    "likewise we may consider the fluctuations at multiple spatial locations by fixing @xmath163 here @xmath164 and @xmath165 measures the fluctuations with respect to the limit shape behavior .",
    "then , in the large time limit , the joint - distributions of the fluctuations are governed by the so - called @xmath27 process , denoted by @xmath166 .",
    "this process was introduced by prhofer and spohn  @xcite in the context of the png model ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a complete definition of the airy@xmath167 process is recalled in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it holds that @xmath168 where @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 are real numbers .",
    "of course , ( [ eq8 ] ) is the special case of ( [ theta_zero_thm ] ) for @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "we now consider how fluctuations in the height function are carried through time .",
    "for instance , if the fluctuation of the height function above the origin is known at time @xmath10 ( large ) for how long can we expect to see this fluctuation persist ( in the @xmath3 scale ) ?",
    "the answer is non - trivial and given by applying theorem  [ growth_thm ] : there exists a single direction in space - time along which the height function fluctuations are carried over time scales of order @xmath174 , while for all other directions only at space - time distances of order @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , given a fixed velocity , any exponent @xmath7 , and any real number @xmath175 , @xmath176-[h\\big(vt , t\\big ) - t\\bar{h}(v ) ] \\right| \\geq m t^{1/3}\\right ) = 0,\\ ] ] for any @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the height fluctuations at time @xmath10 at position @xmath177 and at time and @xmath178 at position @xmath179 differs only of @xmath180 .",
    "these fixed velocity space - time lines are the characteristic of the burgers equation above .",
    "thus , the right space - time scaling limit to consider is that given in equation ( [ fixedpt ] ) , with @xmath15 and @xmath181 now taken to be the tasep height function and asymptotic shape , rather than that of the kpz equation .",
    "as noted below equation ( [ fixedpt ] ) , the value of the velocity @xmath21 should not affect the law of the limiting space - time process .",
    "as evidence for this , equation ( [ theta_zero_thm ] ) shows that we encounter the @xmath182 process as a scaling limit regardless of the value of @xmath183 .",
    "this amounts to saying that the fixed @xmath25 marginals of the full space - time limit process of equation ( [ fixedpt ] ) are independent of @xmath21 .",
    "up to now only the `` spatial - like behavior '' of the space - time process ( [ fixedpt ] ) , i.e. , the process in the variable @xmath48 for fixed @xmath184 ( which one can set to @xmath124 w.l.o.g . ) has been obtained , while the process in the variable @xmath184 remains to be unraveled .",
    "a consequence of ( [ eq11 ] ) is that if we look at the fluctuations at two moments of time @xmath10 and @xmath185 with @xmath186 with @xmath7 , it corresponds to taking @xmath187 in the r.h.s .  of ( [ fixedpt ] ) .",
    "then in the @xmath4 limit , the limit process is identical to the process for fixed @xmath188 .",
    "so , if we determine the limit process for any space - time cut such that in the @xmath4 limit , @xmath189 , then , thanks to slow decorrelation , one can extend the result to any other space - time cut with the same property .",
    "in the following we refer to this property as _ the process limit extends to general @xmath190 dimensional space - time directions _ , meaning that we have @xmath124 dimension with spatial - like behavior and @xmath191 dimensions in the orthogonal direction .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , slow decorrelation also allows for instance ( a ) to translate the limit of different related observables and ( b ) to extend results on fluctuation statistics to space - time regions where correlation functions are unknown .",
    "we illustrate these features in the context of the corner growth model . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case where @xmath192 .",
    "fix @xmath193 , @xmath194 , real numbers @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "then set @xmath195    \\(a ) we first show that one can recover ( [ theta_zero_thm ] ) from an analoguous statement in the corresponding lpp model using ( [ height_lpp ] ) and slow decorrelation .",
    "we start from a result in lpp .",
    "consider the fixed @xmath196 slice of space - time .",
    "this is obtained by setting @xmath197 in ( [ eq13 ] ) , for which @xmath198 using the schur process  @xcite , it is proven  @xcite that for @xmath197 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 to get the result on the height function ( [ theta_zero_thm ] ) using ( [ height_lpp ] ) , one would need to make the choice : @xmath201 .",
    "then we have @xmath202 thus , to obtain ( [ theta_zero_thm ] ) ( for @xmath192 ) from ( [ lpp_limit_thm_eqn ] ) it is actually sufficient to project @xmath139 in ( [ eq16 ] ) on the line @xmath196 along the characteristic line passing through @xmath139 , see figure  [ figuredppext ] for an illustration .",
    "one finds that this projection gives the scaling ( [ eq14 ] ) but with @xmath203 replaced by some @xmath204 as @xmath4 .",
    "the reason is that the characteristics for @xmath205 have slope slightly different from @xmath191 .",
    "finally , slow decorrelation ( theorem  [ growth_thm ] , see also ( [ eq11 ] ) ) and the union bound imply then that @xmath206    [ cb]@xmath207 [ cb]@xmath48 [ c]@xmath126   for some @xmath7 away from the line @xmath196 . then",
    ", the fluctuations of the passage time at the locations of the black dots are , on the @xmath208 scale , the same as those of their projection along the critical direction to the line @xmath196 , the white dots.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    \\(b ) the results for ( [ theta_zero_thm ] ) and ( [ lpp_limit_thm_eqn ] ) are derived by using the knowledge of ( determinantal ) correlation functions .",
    "the techniques used for these models are however restricted to _ space - like paths _ ( in the best case , see  @xcite ) , i.e. , for sequences of points @xmath209 such that @xmath210 and @xmath211 ( which can not be connected by directed paths ) .",
    "now , choose in ( [ eq13 ] ) @xmath212 for some real @xmath213 .",
    "then , it means that we look at the height fluctuations at times @xmath214 , with @xmath215 thus , one can cover much more than only the space - like regions . as before , the projection along the characteristic line of @xmath139 on @xmath216 leads to ( [ eq18 ] ) with @xmath217 and with a slightly modified @xmath203 ( i.e. , @xmath218 ) .",
    "then , using slow decorrelation , one can extend ( [ theta_zero_thm ] ) to the following result : fix @xmath193 , @xmath219 , real numbers @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "set @xmath220 then we have @xmath221 this type of computations can be readily adapted to the other kpz models considered in the sequel .",
    "consider the following random measure @xmath42 on @xmath40 : @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are non - negative random variables .",
    "one may consider directed paths to be restricted to follow the lattice edges .",
    "this is just standard ( point - to - point ) last passage percolation ( as considered for instance in  @xcite ) .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath14 , i.e. , lpp in the 2-dimensional corner .",
    "here we write @xmath136 for weights .    the conditions for our slow decorrelation theorem to hold amount to the existence of a lln and clt .",
    "presently , for point to point lpp , this is only rigorously know for the two solvable classes of weight distributions  exponential and geometric . for general weight distributions , the existence of a lln follows from superadditivity ( via the kingman subadditive ergodic theorem ) , though the exact value of the lln is not known beyond the solvable cases .",
    "none the less , universality is expected at the level of the clt for a very wide class of underlying weight distributions .",
    "that is to say that , after centering by the lln , and under @xmath3 scaling , the fluctuations of lpp should always be given by the @xmath161 distribution . in the results we now state we will restrict attention to exponential weights , as geometric weights lead to analogous results .",
    "define lpp with _ two - sided boundary conditions _ as the model with independent exponential weights such that , for positive parameters @xmath225 , @xmath226 recall that an exponential of rate @xmath227 has mean @xmath228 .",
    "this class of models was introduced in  @xcite ( and for geometric weights in  @xcite ) and includes the one considered in  @xcite .",
    "a full description of the one - point fluctuation limit theorems for @xmath229 was conjectured in  @xcite ( see conjecture 7.1 ) and a complete proof was given in  @xcite .",
