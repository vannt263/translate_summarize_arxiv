    "this means that the metric , the electromagnetic field and their derivatives have not singularities and discontinuities in all the manifold . the fundamental feature of this solution is the lack of conical singularities at the origin .",
    "a distant observer will associate with this solution an electromagnetic mass that is a twice of the mass of the electromagnetic geon founded by m. demianski@xmath5 in 1986 .",

    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we give a short introduction to the born - infeld theory : propierties and principal features . in section 3 the regularity condition as was given by b. hoffmann and l. infeld@xmath4 in 1937 .",

    "this line element has an essential singularity at @xmath41 and does not satisfy the regularity condition .    in the general relativity form of the original new field theory the requeriment that there be no infinities in the @xmath43 forces the identification of gravitational with electromagnetic mass .",
    "in@xmath4 b. hoffmann and l. infeld have used for such identification the line element of the well known monopole solution studied by b. hoffmann@xmath1 in 1935 @xmath49 dr \\ , \\ ] ] that is originated by an einstein - born - infeld action as in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this line element approximates the schwarzschild form for @xmath50 greater than the electronic radius but avoid the infinities of that line element for @xmath41 however is still a singularity of conical type at the pole .",

    "note that , because the conical point , no coordinate can be introduced which will be non singular at @xmath41 and derivatives are actually undefined at this point .",
    "this problem with the conical singularities at @xmath41 , that destroy the regularity condition , makes that in the reference@xmath4 b. hoffmann and l. infeld change the action of the born - infeld form as in equation ( 1 ) for other non - linear lagrangian of logarithmic type . the new logarithmic action does not presented such difficulties at @xmath41 , and makes that time ago many people changes the very nice form of the einstein - born - infeld action ( 1 ) for others non - linear lagrangians that solved the problem of the self - energy of the electron and the regularity condition given above .    in this work we presented a new _ exact _ spherically symmetric solution of the einstein - born - infeld equations .",

    "the lack of the conical singularities at the origin is because the very well description of the manifold in the neighbourhood of @xmath41 given by @xmath164    because the metric is regular ( @xmath194 at @xmath41 and at @xmath195 ) , its derivative must change sign . in the usual gravitational theory of general relativity",
