    "it might appear surprising to include a report from the fermilab tevatron , a proton - antiproton collider , in a session about `` brief reports from the @xmath0  factories '' .",
    "does this mean the tevatron would qualify as a @xmath0  factory ?",
    "there are two advantages of studying @xmath0  physics at the tevatron .",
    "first , all @xmath0  hadrons are produced ; not only charged and neutral @xmath0  mesons as at the @xmath0  factories , but also @xmath3  mesons and @xmath4-baryons .",
    "the second advantage is the @xmath4  quark production cross section , which is about 1  nb at the @xmath5 resonance while it is about 50  @xmath6b for @xmath7 collisions at @xmath8  tev .",
    "this is an enormous cross section which is about 50,000 times larger at the tevatron than at the @xmath0  factories .",
    "it resulted in about @xmath9 @xmath10 quark pairs being produced during the 1992 - 1995 data taking period of the tevatron , called runi . to illustrate the enormous @xmath4  production rate at the tevatron",
    ", we compare the yield of fully reconstructed @xmath0  mesons between the cleo experiment and cdf . in a data sample of about 3000  pb@xmath11",
    ", cleo reconstructs about 200 @xmath0  mesons decaying into @xmath12  @xcite while cdf finds in a sample of about 100  pb@xmath11 of data a signal of about 1000  @xmath12 events with a good signal - to - background ratio  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the @xmath0  factories is to discover @xmath1  violation in @xmath13 decays .",
    "cdf has already presented a measurement of @xmath1  violation in the @xmath0  meson system  @xcite , measuring the time - dependent asymmetry in the yield of @xmath14 events coming from a @xmath15 versus @xmath16 : @xmath17 this asymmetry is directly related to the @xmath1  violation parameter @xmath2 .      here , we briefly summarize cdf s initial measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdfsin2b](a ) shows the @xmath14 yield at cdf , where @xmath18 events have been identified .",
    "this is currently the world s largest sample of fully reconstructed @xmath14 events .",
    "measuring a @xmath1  asymmetry requires knowing whether the @xmath14 originated from a @xmath15 or @xmath16 meson .",
    "this is usually referred to as @xmath0  flavor tagging .",
    "several methods of @xmath0  flavor tagging exist .",
    "some of them exploit the other @xmath0  hadron in the event and search for a lepton from the semileptonic decay of the other @xmath0  hadron or determine the net charge of the jet produced by the other @xmath4  quark .",
    "these two methods are called lepton tagging and jet charge tagging , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0  flavor can also be determined by searching for pions which are produced through fragmentation or @xmath19  mesons in correlation with the @xmath0  meson of interest .",
    "this method is known as same side tagging .",
    "( 40,190)*(a ) * ( 250,190)*(b ) * = 3.0 in = 3.0 in    @xmath0  flavor tagging is the crucial element for a @xmath1  violation measurement at the tevatron .",
    "the figure of merit quantifying how well a flavor tagging algorithm works is the so - called effective tagging efficiency @xmath20 . here , @xmath21 is the efficiency for obtaining a particular flavor tag , and @xmath22 is the dilution defined by the number of right tags ( @xmath23 ) and the number of wrong tags ( @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 .",
    "cdf determined the tagging power of various tagging methods with data measuring the time dependence of @xmath26 flavor oscillations .",
    "such a measurement serves as a demonstration that a particular flavor tag does work in a hadron collider environment and determines its @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdfmix](a ) shows the measured mixing asymmetries as a function of proper decay length using a same side tag  @xcite . from this measurement",
    ", cdf extracts @xmath27 and the effective tagging efficiency for the same side tag to be @xmath28 . as another example , fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfmix](b ) shows the fraction of mixed events as a function of proper decay length using a jet charge and lepton flavor tag  @xcite . this measurement yields @xmath29 as well as @xmath30 and @xmath31 for a lepton tag and jet charge tag , respectively .",
    "( 40,30)*(a ) * ( 400,40)*(b ) * = 2.5 in = 2.5 in    applying all three tagging methods to cdf s sample of @xmath14 events gives the @xmath1  asymmetry distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfsin2b](b ) .",
    "the data prefer a positive asymmetry , resulting in a measurement of @xmath32 .",
    "this can be translated into a limit on @xmath2 being positive ( @xmath33 ) at 93% confidence level .",
    "this is the best direct measurement of @xmath1  violation in the @xmath0  system to date . with this result",
    ", cdf demonstrated that a @xmath1  violation measurement is feasible at the tevatron in runii .",
    "returning to our initial question , we think the tevatron does qualify as a @xmath0  factory capable of measuring @xmath1  violation .",
    "the most important element of the tevatron upgrade for runii is the main injector .",
    "it is a new 150  gev accelerator , half the circumference of the tevatron , which will increase the antiproton intensity into the tevatron , providing 20 times higher luminosities .",
    "the main injector project was finished in june 1999 with the first beam circulating at that time .",
    "runii of the tevatron had originally been defined as 2  fb@xmath11 being delivered in two years to the collider experiments .",
    "runii has recently been extended beyond the initial two years , to continue until 2006 with no major shutdowns , maximizing the delivered luminosity to a total of up to 15  fb@xmath11 .",

    "the most important improvement is a superconducting solenoid ( @xmath34  t ) providing significantly improved tracking capabilities ( see right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : d0upgrade ] ) .",
    "a central fiber tracker consisting of eight superlayers of scintillating fibers allows a measurement of the charged particle momentum .",
    "together with the silicon micro - strip tracker , a momentum resolution of @xmath35 will be achieved .",
    "the silicon tracker consists of six barrels with four layers each ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 readout ) and 12 + 4 forward disks reaching out to 1.25 m in @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , improvements to the muon system will allow enhanced muon triggering for @xmath39  gev@xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "central and forward preshower detectors will improve electron identification and triggering on electrons with @xmath42  gev@xmath40 ( @xmath43 ) . finally , an impact parameter trigger detecting tracks from displaced vertices is under development .",
    "the current d  schedule expects the central and forward preshower fabrication as well as the central fiber tracker project to be completed by june 2000 .",
    "the silicon tracker will be finished by september 2000 and the full tracking system installed and hooked up a few weeks later .",
    "the muon system will be in place by november 2000 and the calorimeter electronics by january 2001 , allowing d  to be rolled in and ready for beam by february 2001 .",
    "= 3.3 in = 2.7 in    the goal for the cdf detector upgrade is to maintain detector occupancies at runi levels , although many of the detector changes also provide qualitatively improved detector capabilities . a schematic view of the cdfii detector is shown in fig .",

    "one major improvement is to the charged particle tracking system ( see fig .  [",

    "in addition , an intermediate silicon layer consisting of two double - sided silicon sensors at larger radii permits stand - alone silicon tracking out to @xmath44 . a new open cell drift chamber ( cot ) will operate at a beam crossing time of 132  ns with a maximum drift time of @xmath45  ns .",
    "the cot consists of 96 layers arranged in four axial and four stereo superlayers .",
    "it also provides d@xmath46/d@xmath47 information for particle identification .",
    "the upgrades to the muon system almost double the central muon coverage",
    ". a new scintillating tile plug calorimeter will give good electron identification up to @xmath44 .",
    "new front - end electronics will be installed , and a daq upgrade will allow the operation of a pipelined trigger system . finally , two additional upgrade projects significantly enhancing the @xmath0  physics capabilities of the cdfii detector have been approved .",
    "these include the installation of a low - mass radiation hard single - sided silicon detector with axial strips at very small radius of @xmath48  cm , as well as the installation of a time - of - flight system employing 216 three - meter - long scintillator bars located between the outer radius of the cot and the superconducting solenoid .",
    "the current cdf schedule foresees cosmic ray running of the detector at the beginning of 2000 and expects the cot to be installed in april 2000 .",
    "a commissioning run will take place from august to november of 2000 .",
