    "the presence of a dusty torus around the central engine was proposed by antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) to explain the broad emission - lines observed in the polarized light of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the torus absorbs a large fraction of the nuclear emission and reradiates it in the infrared .",
    "this is the basis of the so - called agn unification scheme largely analysed in the literature and that provides a geometrical explanation for the observed differences between broad line and narrow line objects .",
    "after the pioneering work by edelson & malkan ( 1986 ) , the characteristics of the continuum due to dust heated by the optical - uv nuclear radiation has been analyzed by several authors ( barvainis 1992 , pier & krolik 1992 ; laor & draine 1993 ; granato & danese 1994 ; granato , danese & franceschini 1997 , nenkova , ivezi & elitzur 2002 ) .",
    "the infrared emission is generally associated to a dusty torus surrounding the central source of the agn .",
    "although proposed by pier and krolik ( 1992,1993 ) , the calculation of the radiative transfer radiation throughout a clumpy torus has only been recently performed by nenkova et al .",
    "the agn obscuring region is modelled as a toroidal distribution of dusty clouds placed at different radii from the center , each with same optical depth .",
    "the optically thick clumps are heated by the nuclear radiation as well as from the radiation originated in other clumps .",
    "the dust temperature is much higher in their illuminated side .",
    "the authors claim that heating by diffuse radiation is highly inefficient and can be neglected .",
    "following their results , a clumpy torus accounts for both , the often observed broad ir bump extending up to 100  and the absence of the 10  silicate feature in type 1 - on axis view- objects .    in general ,",
    "two type of models are used in the literature : a compact torus ( radial dimension smaller than a few pc ) with a large optical depth , and a more extended ( up to hundreds pc ) moderately thick disk .",
    "a common characteristic to all is that dust survival in the vicinity of the agn is set by its evaporation limit .",
    "therefore , dust can reach temperatures up to 1000 - 1500 k. overall , these models provide a reasonable fit to the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) the torus models usually assume a high equatorial opacity leading to flat spectra for type 1 and steep spectra for type 2 galaxies . however , as pointed out by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the large number of spectral indices observed in both types of galaxies , as well as the large number of intermediate and type 1 objects with steep seds , can not be explained by the torus model .",
    "other simpler descriptions of the ir sed include e.g. , that by blain , barnard , & chapman ( 2003 ) who describe the far - ir to submillimeter sed of dusty galaxies with different forms of modified black - body models .",
    "although most available models provide in a way or other a fair representation of the ir sed , we believe that a more sounded physical approach is needed . an important problem affecting all these models - those mentioned above , as well as in the case of blain s et al .",
    "approach , is that the results are independent of the dust - to gas ratio .    for several years",
    ", we are pursuing the development of self - consistent models aimed at explaining both the emission - line and sed of agn .",
    "these models have proved to be successful in a number of representative seyfert galaxies ( contini , prieto , viegas 1998a , b , contini , viegas , & prieto 2002 ) . in our modelling approach ,",
    "the infrared - optical continuum is due to dust emission and free - free emission from the clouds powered by the nuclear radiation , diffuse radiation and by shocks .",
    "shocks are due to the cloud motion through a dilute gas ( contini & viegas - aldrovandi 1990 , viegas & contini 1994 , contini & viegas 2000 ) .",
    "an important aspect considered in that approach are the conditions of dust survival when effects as sputtering and grain - gas collisions are taken on board .",
    "thus , these models offer an alternative to the torus model , particularly for the objects showing infrared emission as extended as the narrow - line region .",
    "overall , we consider a model to be well constrained when both the complete sed and the emission - line spectrum are simultaneously modeled .",
    "when possible , that has been our approach , e.g. in the references quoted above .",
    "however , in this paper , we focus on the optical - ir continuum only , since in this wavelength range the best estimate of the nuclear flux emission and of shock velocities for a reasonable number of seyfert galaxies of different types ( the sample by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2003 ) is available .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "a short review of the processes involving dust is given in sect .",
    "numerical simulations accounting for the presence of both shocks and photoionization in the nlr are presented and applied to the seds of seyfert galaxies , described in alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , in sect .",
    "3 . concluding remarks appear in sect .",
    "an empirical method derived from the models , aimed at providing a first assessment of the nature of the observed ir continuum , is presented in the appendix .",
    "when the physical conditions of a dust cloud is due to a combination of photoionization and shock , the dust heating and temperature will depend on the uv radiations as well as on the post - shock temperature .",
    "the maximum grain temperature , which would account for the near infrared emission , is limited by sublimation .",
    "an estimate for some seyfert 2 galaxies shows that the critical distance for grain survival , i.e. , the distance where the grain temperature is equal to the evaporation temperature , for both graphite and silicate , is in the range 0.25 to 50 pc , depending on the luminosity of the central source ( vaceli et al .",
    "in addition , the value of the temperature reached by the grains depends on the presence of small grains and on a strong uv radiation from the central source .",
    "several lines of evidence are pointing towards the destruction of very small grains in regions of high uv radiation intensity ( rowan - robinson 1992 ) .",
    "destruction of dust by those effects are relevant when gas velocities about or larger than 300 are present ; still , velocities of @xmath0 100 can have an effect on dust destruction as we shall see below .    in the following , the effect of photoionization and shocks on the temperature and survival of dust grains in an emitting cloud of the nlr is reviewed .",
    "our models result from numerical simulations with the code suma ( viegas & contini 1994 , viegas & contini 1997 , and references therein ) which requires the following input parameters : the shock velocity , , the preshock density , 0 , the preshock magnetic field , 0 , an ionizing radiation spectrum , the chemical composition of the gas and a dust - to - gas ratio @xmath1 . as ionizing continuum , a power - law characterized by the ionizing flux at the lyman limit ( in photons @xmath2 , s@xmath3 , ev@xmath3 ) and",
    "a spectral index , or a combination of spectral indices in different wavelength ranges , is considered .",
    "a plan - parallel symmetry is adopted with the calculations starting at the shocked edge and the cloud divided in slabs .",
    "the number of slabs is chosen according to the precision required by the calculation of the physical conditions .",
    "the geometrical thickness of the cloud , d , is also an input parameter in the case where shock and photoionization act on the opposite edges of the cloud .",
    "this is the common case for clouds flowing outward from the nucleus .",
    "the models discussed here have been obtained assuming a spectral index of 1.5 , cosmic chemical abundances for he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , and fe ( allen 1973 ) , and 0 = 10@xmath4 gauss . the other input parameters are variable in ranges established by the observations as well as by previous modelling of the nlr .",
    "as the calculations account for the sputtering in the different zone downstream of the shock front ( viegas & contini 1994 ) , the distribution of the grain sizes along the cloud is automatically derived by suma starting from an initial size . in agn , carbon and pah grain features are relatively less prominent than , for example , in starburst galaxies , therefore only silicate grains are considered ( siebenmorgen et al 2003 ) .",
    "self - consistent calculations lead to the continuum and emission - line spectra which are compared with the data .          as nenkova et al .",
    "we also consider an ensemble of dusty clouds placed at different distances from the active center . in our model , radiation transfer of primary and secondary radiation throughout a cloud is calculated consistently with collisional processes due to the shock .",
    "moreover , we consider that _ the observed continuum corresponds to reprocessed radiation from both dust and gas in the clouds .",
    "_ for nlr clouds moving outwards , in the edge of the cloud facing the photoionizing source , dust and gas are mainly heated by the primary radiation , although the effect of the diffuse radiation from the ionized gas can not be neglected .",
    "collision effects are less important because they increase with temperature , which is usually smaller in the photoionized region .",
    "the temperature of the gas , in fact , does not exceed 2 - 3 10@xmath5 k in this region .    on the other hand , at the opposite edge , the gas is collisionally heated to relatively high temperatures by the shock .",
    "the post - shock temperatures depend on the shock velocity ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) . in these models ,",
    "dust and gas are coupled throughout the shock front .",
    "collision phenomena dominate at high temperature leading to relatively high temperatures of gas and grains .",
    "diffuse radiation from the hot gas bridges between the shock dominated and the radiation dominated sides of the cloud .",
    "the structure of the gas downstream is determined by the shock .",
    "in fact , the density distribution results from compression and the temperature distribution is strongly affected by the cooling rate . due to gas and dust",
    "mutually heating and cooling , the maximum temperature of dust depends on the shock velocity , which therefore determines the frequency of the reradiation peak in the infrared .",
    "an analytical relation between the wavelength of the maximum intensity of dust reradiation in the ir spectrum and shock velocity is given by draine ( 1981 ) .",
    "the hot nlr clouds produce bremsstrahlung . depending on the temperature distribution in the cloud",
    ", this mechanism may contribute to the infrared continuum ( see , for instance , contini & viegas - aldrovandi 1990 , fig 2c ) . _",
    "the intensity of dust ir emission relative to bremsstrahlung depends on the dust - to - gas ratio d / g . _",
    "usually the dust contribution dominates in the far infrared range but in the near - ir , both processes may contribute to the continuum as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the single - cloud continuum of model m3 ( table 1 ) is plotted .",
    "the behaviour at high frequency of the free - free emission is largely dependent on the gas velocities . in fig .",
    "1 , it shows a linear behavior at low frequencies , then a local maximum , then a maximum at a higher frequency",
    ". however , for shock - dominated clouds , the bremsstrahlung shows only a maximum at higher frequencies .",
    "those are the most common types of continuum obtained from a single - cloud model .",
    "very seldom the line and continuum spectra of the galaxies can be reproduced by single - cloud models ; on the other hand , multi - cloud models are generally required to explain the multiwavelength spectrum and are obtained as a weighted average of the single - cloud models .",
    "the characteristics of some of the most common single - clouds found in our previous analysis are listed in table 1 .",
    "multi - cloud models lead to ir bumps wider than black body curves .",
    "actually , in some compact objects , e.g. mrk 3 , mrk 34 , and mrk 78 ( contini & viegas 2000 ) dust emission is associated to a single velocity model .",
    "this is in contrast with the modelling of circinus sed ( contini et al . ) , which requires clouds with different velocities contributing at different frequencies in the infrared range .",
    "that suggests that images of circinus in the different ir wavelengths may show very different .",
    "previous modelling of the representative galaxies with suma ( e.g. ngc 5252 , circinus , ngc 4151 ) provided us with hints on which types of clouds are predominant in the nlr ( contini , viegas & prieto 1998a , b , contini & viegas 2000 ) . adopting an initial grain size of 0.20 , it was found that   ranges between 100 and 1000 , 0 between 100 and 1000 3 , log ( ) between 8 and 13 , and d between 0.01 and 10 pc .",
    "the ir bump results from summing up the sed contribution of dusty clouds with different velocities within the nlr , each of them peaking at the corresponding frequency .",
    "the maximum of dust emission occurs in the mid - ir for relatively high velocity clouds .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio may vary from cloud to cloud . from the results obtained for seyfert galaxies previously modelled by suma",
