    "one of the manifestations of gravitational lensing is the coherent distortion of the images of faint background galaxies near foreground matter concentrations due to their tidal gravitational field .",
    "this effect is now well established for lensing by large - scale structure [ e.g. van waerbeke et al .",

    "2001 ; van waerbeke et al .  2001 ] , in which case it is called `` cosmic shear '' , and for lensing by galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "following pioneering work by kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) , detailed two - dimensional mass maps of galaxy clusters were constructed [ e.g. fischer & tyson 1997 ; clowe et al .",
    "2000 ; hoekstra , franx & kuijken 2000 ] and the weaker effect of galaxy groups were stacked to quantify their mean properties ( hoekstra et al .",
    "see for example mellier ( 1999 ) and bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 ) for recent reviews on weak lensing .",
    "being sensitive only to projected total mass , weak gravitational lensing also allows the detection of sufficiently massive haloes only by the effects of their mass , regardless of their composition , physical state and relation to luminous material ( erben et al .",
    "cumulative measures for their gravitational tidal field , or shear , were proposed , among which the so - called _ aperture mass _ ( kaiser et al .  1994 ; schneider 1996 ) is most directly related to observations .",
    "the aperture mass is a suitably weighted integral of the surface mass density inside a circular aperture , which is equivalent to a differently weighted integral over the net tangential shear within the aperture .",
    "the aperture mass is therefore a direct observable .",
    "it was recently shown in a different context ( bartelmann 2001 ) that it depends on the density profile of a halo as to which _ physical _ halo property the aperture mass actually measures .",
    "while the aperture mass is @xmath1 for singular isothermal profiles , it is @xmath2 for the universal profile proposed by navarro , frenk & white  ( 1997 , hereafter nfw ) , with @xmath3 being the virial halo mass .    in this paper",
    ", we study the consequences of this difference in detail .",
    "the basic idea is this .",
    "given a fixed sensitivity limit of aperture mass measurements , the flatter dependence of aperture mass on virial mass for nfw haloes compared to isothermal haloes implies that aperture mass measurements can cover a broader physical mass range if the halo population has nfw rather than isothermal profiles .",
    "the physical masses accessible to aperture mass measurements correspond to rich groups and clusters , whose mass function is steep , turning over from power - law to exponential decrease with increasing mass .",
    "even a small change in the accessible mass range can thus give rise to substantial changes in the numbers of haloes expected to be detectable with the aperture mass method .",
    "conversely , this implies that number counts of haloes with significant aperture mass can sensitively constrain the halo density profiles , without the need to obtain detailed density profiles of individual haloes .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we summarise the aperture mass and its relevant properties in sect .",

    "the _ aperture mass _ , suggested in schneider ( 1996 ) to quantify the weak - lensing effects of dark - matter haloes , is an integral over the lensing convergence @xmath4 within a circular aperture of angular radius @xmath5 , weighted by a function @xmath6 which vanishes outside the aperture , @xmath7 the prime advantage of @xmath8 is that it can directly be determined from the measured tidal distortions of background - galaxy images in the chosen aperture , provided @xmath6 is compensated , i.e. @xmath9 a broad class of weighting functions satisfies this condition . in schneider",
    "et al . ( 1998 ) the simple form was suggested , @xmath10\\,\\left [      \\frac{1}{3}-\\left(\\frac{\\vartheta}{\\theta}\\right)^2    \\right ] \\label{eq:2.3}\\ ] ] within the aperture , and @xmath11 outside .",
    "the aperture mass depends on source redshift because the convergence @xmath4 does .",
    "since this is a linear dependence , and @xmath8 depends linearly on @xmath4 , a realistic source redshift distribution like @xmath12 \\label{eq:2.3a}\\ ] ] can easily be taken into account by averaging @xmath8 over @xmath13 .",
    "we choose @xmath14 and @xmath15 here and assume from now on that source - redshift averaged aperture masses are being used . for simplicity , we denote them by @xmath8 as before , as there is no risk of confusion .    schneider ( 1996 ) also calculated the dispersion of @xmath8 due to the finite number of randomly distributed background galaxies and their intrinsic ellipticities .",
    "assuming typical values for the number density @xmath16 of suitably bright background galaxies and for the dispersion @xmath17 of their intrinsic ellipticities , it was found that @xmath18    it can be shown by means of the cauchy - schwarz inequality that the signal - to - noise ratio for a given halo is maximised if the weighting function @xmath6 is chosen such that it follows the halo density profile . with the latter unknown , this",
    "can not generally be achieved , but we shall show later that the optimisation of weighting functions is of minor importance .",
    "the aperture size @xmath5 should be chosen large enough to encompass a substantial number of background galaxies and to significantly cover the extent of dark - matter haloes , and small enough in comparison with typical field sizes and typical separations between neighbouring haloes .",
    "aperture sizes of a few arc minutes seem appropriate ; to be specific , we choose @xmath19 in the following unless stated otherwise [ see also kruse & schneider 1999 ] .",
    "let us now investigate the effect on the aperture mass if the density profile of a halo of fixed physical mass @xmath3 is changed .",
    "we choose two alternative density profiles , the singular isothermal sphere and the profile suggested by nfw .",
    "we assume that halo masses are virial masses , i.e.  masses confined by the virial radius @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hubble function at redshift @xmath23 .",
    "the virial radius is defined such that the mean density within @xmath20 is @xmath24 times the critical density .",
    "a singular isothermal sphere has the density profile @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ( radially constant ) velocity dispersion along the line - of - sight . integrating ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) out to the virial radius ( [ eq:2.5 ] )",
    ", we find the virial mass @xmath27 it is important for the following that the velocity dispersion scales with mass as @xmath28    projecting the density profile ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) along the line - of - sight and scaling the resulting surface mass density @xmath29 with its critical value for lensing , @xmath30 we arrive at the lensing convergence @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the angular einstein radius , @xmath33 here and in ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) , @xmath34 are the angular diameter distances between observer and lens , observer and source , and lens and source , respectively .",
    "inserting ( [ eq:2.10 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) into ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) , we find the aperture mass for the singular isothermal sphere , @xmath35 since the einstein radius scales with @xmath36 , we see from ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) that @xmath37      nfw used numerical @xmath38-body simulations to show that relaxed haloes assume the universal density profile @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the critical density and @xmath41 is a characteristic overdensity .",
    "the characteristic radial scale @xmath42 is related to the virial radius through @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the concentration parameter .",
    "bartelmann ( 1996 ) showed that the nfw profile has the lensing convergence @xmath45 with the convergence scale @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "nfw described how the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 are related to the virial mass @xmath3 of the halo . hence , despite the two formal parameters in the profile ( [ eq:2.14 ] ) , it is entirely determined once the halo mass is fixed .",
    "the statistics of dark - matter haloes described by the nfw density profile has also been investigated by kruse & schneider ( 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no closed expression for the aperture mass of an nfw profile .",
    "numerically , however , it turns out to be fairly shallow , approaching a constant for small apertures @xmath48 .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to expand the aperture mass into a series in @xmath49 were @xmath50 is the angular scale radius , @xmath51 .",

    "therefore , @xmath55 essentially measures the scale radius @xmath42 or , equivalently , @xmath56 cf .",
    "( [ eq:2.5 ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq:2.19 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.13 ] ) show that the _ aperture mass _ measures different physical quantities depending on the density profile of a given halo . although the scaling with virial mass is not wildly different between singular isothermal spheres and nfw haloes , the effect on weak - lensing observations of a halo population can be substantial , as we shall show below . for a given virial halo mass ,",
    "the virial radius is determined by ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) .",
    "irrespective of the density profile , the halo mass within @xmath20 is therefore fixed .",
    "for the isothermal profile , the mass grows linearly with radius to reach @xmath3 at @xmath20 , while it grows more rapidly for @xmath57 and less rapidly beyond @xmath42 in case of an nfw density profile .",
    "the mass enclosed by @xmath58 in an nfw halo thus exceeds that in a singular isothermal halo for all @xmath59 . an nfw halo concentrates more mass in a given radius @xmath59 , and therefore produces a stronger weak lensing effect for a given aperture size if @xmath60 .",
    "although the previous scaling ( [ eq:2.19 ] ) was derived in the limit of small apertures , @xmath61 , the preceding argument shows that the main result will continue to hold also for larger apertures , namely that an nfw halo needs less mass to produce the same weak - lensing signal as a singular isothermal halo .",
    "as mentioned before , @xmath8 can be optimised by choosing the weight function @xmath6 such that it follows the halo density profile ( schneider 1996 ) . of course",
    ", this can not completely be achieved because of the requirement ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) that @xmath6 be compensated .",
    "it is , however , possible to choose the weighting function such that it approximately follows the slope of the halo density profile within most of the aperture . for singular isothermal spheres ,",
    "such an approximation could be @xmath62 where @xmath63 removes the central singularity , @xmath64 must be chosen to satisfy ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) and the normalisation is the same as for ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) .",
    "for the nfw profile , an optimised weighting function is more difficult to construct because the physical scale @xmath42 changes its angular size with halo distance , so that the weighting function would have to vary with distance . near @xmath42 , where the nfw profile gently steepens from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , the profile is approximately isothermal , so some improvement from using ( [ eq:2.19a ] ) instead of ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) is also expected for the nfw profile .",

    "the source redshift is @xmath69 .",
    "while @xmath8 falls like @xmath70 for the sis , it flattens for small @xmath5 for the nfw case .",

    "while @xmath72 falls @xmath73 for the singular isothermal sphere , it flattens for @xmath48 for the nfw profile . the weighting function ( [ eq:2.19a ] ) , which is adapted to the isothermal profile , improves @xmath72 quite appreciably for the singular isothermal sphere , and less so for the nfw profile .",
    "since the noise ( [ eq:2.4 ] ) is proportional to @xmath70 , the s / n of @xmath72 is constant with @xmath5 for the singular isothermal sphere , and is maximised for the nfw profile at a filter scale of a few arc minutes , where its slope is isothermal .",

    "we use the mass function by jenkins et al .  for the results shown below .    for rich groups and clusters ,",

    ", @xmath8 decreases faster for singular isothermal spheres than for haloes with nfw profile .",
    "the halo mass range probed by the aperture mass will therefore be narrower if the halo population consists of singular isothermal spheres than if it consists of nfw haloes .",
    "considering the steepness of the halo mass function , we expect to see substantially more haloes with significant aperture mass if the halo population is characterised by the nfw density profile compared to the singular isothermal profile .",

    "we describe significant weak gravitational lensing by a halo in terms of the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath108 with @xmath109 given by ( [ eq:2.4 ] ) . to be specific , we require @xmath110 for a significant measurement of the aperture mass , and choose @xmath111 in the following .",
    "in the absence of noise , there would be a one - to - one relation between aperture mass and physical mass , so that a sharp detection cut - off on @xmath8 would map onto a sharp threshold in mass .",

    "contrary to that expectation , the halo number tends to increase slightly with increasing @xmath123 .",
    "the reason for this trend is the fact that the overdensity inside virialised haloes grows with increasing @xmath123 .",

    "this result was found earlier ( bartelmann 2001 ) , but we repeat it here for completeness . depending on the density profile ,",
    "the aperture mass is therefore sensitive to different scalings of the physical halo mass .",

    "the somewhat surprising result that the number of weak - lensing haloes does not substantially change with cosmic density is due to the balance between halo evolution and halo compactness .",
    "while the number of haloes decreases much more rapidly with increasing redshift in a high - density universe , their virial overdensity is higher , giving rise to a stronger lensing signal . as illustrated in fig .",

    "of course , dark - matter density profiles can also be directly measured using weak lensing methods . however",

    "<S> integral measures of weak gravitational lensing by dark - matter haloes , like the aperture mass , are sensitive to different physical halo properties dependent on the halo mass density profile . for isothermal profiles , </S>",
    "<S> the relation between aperture mass and virial mass is steeper than for haloes with the universal nfw profile . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the halo mass range probed by the aperture mass is much wider for nfw than for isothermal haloes . </S>",
    "<S> we use recent modifications to the press - schechter mass function in cdm models normalised to the local abundance of rich clusters , to predict the properties of the halo sample expected to be accessible with the aperture mass technique . while @xmath0 haloes should be detected per square degree if the haloes have nfw profiles , their number density is lower by approximately an order of magnitude if they have isothermal profiles . </S>",
    "<S> these results depend only very mildly on the cosmological background model . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that counts of haloes with a significant weak - lensing signal are a powerful discriminator between different dark - matter profiles . </S>"
