    "in the past , neutrino scattering experiments have played a key role in establishing the validity of the electroweak standard model . today , even with the large samples of on - shell @xmath20 and @xmath21 bosons at @xmath22 and @xmath23 colliders , precision measurements of neutrino - nucleon scattering still play an important role . not only are these measurements competitive in precision with direct probes of weak boson parameters , but they also test the validity of the electroweak theory in different processes and over many orders of magnitude in @xmath24 . in this respect ,",
    "if neutrino scattering observed deviations from expectations based on direct measurements from @xmath20 and @xmath21 bosons , this would be an exciting hint of new physics entering in tree - level processes or in radiative corrections .",
    "in particular , neutrino scattering would be sensitive to a different menu of non - standard model effects ranging from leptoquark exchange to neutrino oscillations@xcite .",
    "experimental quantities sensitive to electroweak physics that are most precisely measured in neutrino scattering are the ratios of charged - current ( @xmath20 exchange ) to neutral - current ( @xmath21 exchange ) scattering cross - sections from quarks in heavy nuclei .",
    "the ratio of these cross - sections for either neutrino or anti - neutrino scattering from isoscalar targets of @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks can be written as@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the isoscalar sums of the squared left or right - handed quark couplings to the @xmath21 . at tree level in the standard model , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; therefore , @xmath32 is particularly sensitive to .    in a real target , there are corrections to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ls ] resulting from the presence of heavy quarks in the sea , the production of heavy quarks in the target , non leading - order quark - parton model terms in the cross - section , electromagnetic radiative corrections and any isovector component of the light quarks in the target .",
    "in particular , in the case where a charm - quark is produced from scattering off of low-@xmath33 sea quarks , the uncertainties resulting from the effective mass suppression of the heavy final - state charm quark are large .",
    "the uncertainty in this suppression ultimately limited the precision of previous @xmath34 scattering experiments which measured electroweak parameters@xcite .    to eliminate the effect of uncertainties resulting from scattering from sea quarks , one can instead form a quantity suggested by paschos and wolfenstein@xcite , @xmath35 since @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the effect of scattering from sea quarks , which is symmetric under @xmath38 , cancels in the difference of neutrino and anti - neutrino cross - sections .",
    "while allowing substantially reduced uncertainties , @xmath2 is a more difficult quantity to measure than @xmath32 , primarily because neutral current neutrino and anti - neutrino scattering have identical observed final states and can only be separated by _ a priori _ knowledge of the initial state neutrino .",
    "the nutev detector consists of an @xmath39  m long , @xmath40  ton target calorimeter with a mean density of @xmath41  g/@xmath42 , followed by an iron toroid spectrometer .",
    "the target calorimeter consists of 168 iron plates , @xmath43 m  @xmath44  @xmath43 m  @xmath44  @xmath45 cm each .",
    "the active elements are liquid scintillation counters spaced every two plates and drift chambers spaced every four plates . there are a total of 84 scintillation counters and 42 drift chambers in the target . the toroid spectrometer is not directly used in this analysis .",
    "nutev used a continuous test beam of hadrons , muons and electrons to calibrate the calorimeter and toroid response .    in this detector @xmath46",
    "charged - current events are identified by the presence of an energetic muon in the final state which travels a long distance in the target calorimeter .",
    "quantitatively , a length is measured for each event based on the number of neighboring scintillation counters above a low threshold . charged - current candidates are those events with a length of greater than @xmath47 counters ( @xmath48  m of steel - equivalent ) , and all other events are neutral - current candidates .",
    "nutev s target calorimeter sits in the sign - selected quadrupole train ( ssqt ) neutrino beam at the fnal tevatron .",
    "the observed neutrinos result from decays of pions and kaons produced from the interactions of @xmath49  gev protons in a production target .",
    "immediately downstream of the target , a dipole magnet with @xmath50  t - m bends pions and kaons of one charge in the direction of the nutev detector , while oppositely charged and neutral mesons are stopped in dumps . focusing magnets",
    "then direct the sign - selected mesons into a @xmath51  km decay region which ends @xmath52  km upstream of the nutev detector .",
    "the resulting beam is either almost purely neutrino or anti - neutrino , depending of the selected sign of mesons .",
    "anti - particle backgrounds are observed at a level of less than 12 parts in @xmath53 .",
    "the beam is almost entirely muon neutrinos , with electron neutrinos creating @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the observed interactions from the neutrino and anti - neutrino beams , respectively .",
    "because charged - current electron neutrino interactions usually lack an energetic muon in the final state , they are almost always identified as neutral - current interactions in the nutev detector .",
    "therefore , the electron neutrino content of the beam must be very precisely known .",
    "most ( @xmath56 in the neutrino beam and @xmath57 in the anti - neutrino beam ) observed @xmath58s result from @xmath59 decays .",
    "the remainder are products of prompt decays of charmed particles or neutral kaons , or decays of secondary muons .",
    "prediction of the former component comes from a beam monte carlo , tuned to reproduce the observed @xmath46 flux ( figure  [ fig : flux - tune ] ) . because of the precise alignment of the magnetic optics in the ssqt , this procedure results in a fractional uncertainty on the prediction of @xmath58 from @xmath59 of @xmath60 , dominated by the @xmath59 branching ratio uncertainty .",
    "small detector calibration uncertainties , @xmath61 on the calorimeter and muon toroid energy scale , affect the measured @xmath46 flux and also contribute substantial uncertainties to both the muon and electron neutrino fluxes .",
    "sources of @xmath58 other than @xmath62 decay have larger uncertainties , at the 1020% level , because of the lack of a direct constraint from the data .",
    "events selected for this analysis are required to deposit at least @xmath47  gev in the target calorimeter to ensure efficient triggering and vertex identification .",
    "the location of the neutrino interaction must be within the central @xmath63 of the calorimeter s transverse dimensions , at least @xmath64  m of steel - equivalent from the upstream end of the calorimeter , and at least @xmath65  m from the downstream end .",
    "the first requirement reduces the misidentification of @xmath46 events with muons exiting the side of the calorimeter ; the second reduces non - neutrino backgrounds , and the third ensures sufficient calorimeter downstream of the interaction to measure the event length .",
    "small backgrounds from cosmic - ray and muon induced events are subtracted from the sample .",
    "after all cuts , @xmath66  million and @xmath67  million events are observed in the neutrino and anti - neutrino beam , respectively .",
    "the ratios of neutral - current candidates ( short events ) to charged - current candidates ( long events ) , , are @xmath68 in the neutrino beam and @xmath69 in the anti - neutrino beam .    is related to the ratios of cross - sections and  using a detailed detector and cross - section monte carlo simulation with the tuned flux ( figure  [ fig : flux - tune ] ) as input .",
    "this monte carlo must predict the substantial cross - talk between the samples . in the neutral - current sample ,",
    "the backgrounds in the neutrino and anti - neutrino beam from @xmath46 charged - current events are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and the backgrounds from @xmath58 charged - currents are @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the charged - current sample has only a @xmath74 background from neutral - current events for each beam .",
    "the important details of the detector for this analysis are the calorimeter response to muons , the measurement of the neutrino interaction vertex , and the range of hadronic showers in the calorimeter . the efficiency , noise and active areas of the scintillation counters are all measured using neutrino data or muons from the testbeam . longitudinal and transverse vertex resolutions and biases",
    "are studied using a geant - based detector monte carlo .",
    "the longitudinal bias , which directly impacts the length measurement , is measured from the data using track - based vertices in events with two energetic final state muons .",
    "hadronic shower length in the calorimeter is measured using hadrons from the testbeam . to study possible effects from the difference in strange - quark content between neutrino - induced and @xmath75-induced showers , hadronic showers from @xmath76s",
    "are used as a cross - check .",
    "no significant differences are observed .",
    "measured detector parameters are varied within their uncertainties in the monte carlo to study systematic errors associated with this simulation .",
    "the cross - section model is of paramount importance to this analysis .",
    "neutrino - quark deep - inelastic scattering processes are simulated using a leading - order cross - section model .",
    "neutrino - electron scattering and quasi - elastic scattering are also included .",
    "leading - order parton momentum distributions come from a modified buras - gaemers parameterization@xcite of structure function data from the ccfr experiment@xcite which used the same target - calorimeter and cross - section model as nutev .",
    "the parton distributions are modified to produce @xmath25 and @xmath26 valence and sea quark asymmetries consistent with muon scattering@xcite and drell - yan@xcite data .",
    "the shape and magnitude of the strange sea come from an analysis of events in ccfr with two oppositely charged muons ( e.g. , @xmath77 , @xmath78)@xcite .",
    "mass suppression from heavy quark production is generated in a slow - rescaling model whose parameters are measured from the same dimuon data . the charm sea is taken from the cteq4l parton distribution functions@xcite . the magnitude of the charm sea is assigned a @xmath79 uncertainty and the slow - rescaling mass for @xmath80 is varied from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "our parameterization of @xmath83 is based on qcd predictions and data@xcite and is varied by @xmath84 of itself in order to estimate uncertainties .",
    "electroweak and pure qed radiative corrections to the scattering cross - sections are applied using computer code supplied by bardin@xcite , and uncertainties are estimated by varying parameters of these corrections .",
    "possible higher - twist corrections are considered with a @xmath79 uncertainty using a vmd - based model which is constrained by lepto - production data@xcite .",
    "the key test of the monte carlo is its ability to predict the length distribution of events in the detector .",
