    "the discovery of the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite opened up a new research arena for cosmologists , astrophysicists , and particle physicists . from the viewpoint of particle physics",
    "the cosmological constant naturally appears as a vacuum energy of quantum fields , but its energy scale is usually very different from the observed dark energy scale @xcite . as an alternative to the cosmological constant , dynamical dark energy models  such as quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , @xmath2 gravity @xcite , @xmath3 gravity @xcite , dgp braneworld @xcite , and galileon @xcite  have been proposed .",
    "these models give rise to a time - varying equation of state @xmath4 of dark energy , where @xmath5 is the scale factor in the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological background @xcite .    at the background level it is possible to discriminate between a host of dark energy models by confronting @xmath4 with the observations of supernova type ia ( sn ia ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "for this purpose several different parametrizations of @xmath4 have been proposed  which are mostly based on two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite ( see refs .",

    "a well known example is the so - called chevalier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xmath10 @xcite , where @xmath6 is the value of @xmath0 today ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the 2-parameter parametrizations have been widely used for constraining the property of dark energy @xcite .    with two parameters one usually fixes @xmath6 and the value of @xmath0 in the asymptotic past ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "in this case it is generally difficult to accommodate the time @xmath13 and the width @xmath14 of the transition in two asymptotic regimes .",
    "@xcite first proposed a 4-parameter parametrization involving @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "this allows for quintessence models with tracker solutions having a rapid transition @xcite , which is difficult to be addressed by the 2-parameter parametrization .",
    "bassett _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite carried out the likelihood analysis with the kink parametrization by using the gold sn ia data @xcite in 2004 .",
    "they found that the best - fit corresponds to the case in which @xmath0 is nearly constant ( @xmath16 ) for the redshift @xmath17 larger than 0.1 and rapidly decreases toward @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "this evolution of @xmath0 is outside the limits of the two - parameter parametrizations , which implies that two parameters are not generally sufficient to implement such a rapid transition approximately @xcite-@xcite .",
    "apart from the tracker models with the inverse power - law potential @xcite , the field equation of state usually contains more than 3 free parameters @xcite . ] .",
    "_ @xcite also showed that the rapidly varying equation of state is consistent with the cmb and large - scale structure data accumulated by 2004 .",

    "<S> we place observational constraints on models with the late - time cosmic acceleration based on a number of parametrizations allowing fast transitions for the equation of state of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the model of linder and huterer where the dark energy equation of state @xmath0 monotonically grows or decreases in time , we propose two new parametrizations in which @xmath0 has an extremum . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out the likelihood analysis with the three parametrizations by using the observational data of supernovae type ia , cosmic microwave background , and baryon acoustic oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> although the transient cosmic acceleration models with fast transitions can give rise to the total chi square smaller than that in the @xmath1-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath1cdm ) model , these models are not favored over @xmath1cdm when one uses the akaike information criterion which penalizes the extra degrees of freedom present in the parametrizations . </S>"
