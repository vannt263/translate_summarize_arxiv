    "the interpretation of the ` o - rich agb sequence ' is a key question in the understanding of agb stellar evolution .",
    "it has been shown by several authors ( e.g. bedijn 1987 ) that this sequence reflects the increase of optical thickness of the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) of agb stars , the objects with the thinnest cse being placed in the bluest part and those with the thickest cse in the reddest part of the sequence . however ,",
    "this can be interpreted in two different ways : i ) as an * evolutionary sequence * ( e.g. van der veen & habing 1988 ) : every o - rich agb star would start the agb phase at the blue end of this sequence , and would later move while increasing its mass - loss rate until reaching the red extreme at the end of the agb ; ii ) as * mass sequence * ( e.g. lpine et al .",
    "1995 ) : their different location would be just a consequence of their different initial mass , which would determine the mass - loss rate .",
    "a third interpretation was proposed , which is a combination of the previous ones : all o - rich agb stars would move towards redder colours as they increase their mass - loss rate , but only the more massive stars would be able to reach the reddest end of the sequence ( garca - lario 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , there is not a common opinion on the evolutionary connection between different classes of agb stars and different classes of planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "recently , we have published the result of a large scale near - infrared photometric survey of two different samples of o - rich agb stars ( jimnez - esteban et al .",
    "2005a , b ) : the ` arecibo sample ' ( 363 ) and the ` glmp sample ' ( 94 ) .",
    "in total we compiled 457 stars providing a good coverage of the ` o - rich agb sequence ' ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the two samples are complementary .",
    "the ` arecibo sample ' is mainly formed by objects from the blue part of the sequence , with a small contribution from very red sources , while the ` glmp sample ' contains exclusively sources in the redder part of the sequence .",
    "for all the objects in the sample we have collected : j ( 1.25@xmath0 m ) , h ( 1.65@xmath0 m ) and k ( 2.2@xmath0 m ) photometric data from our own observations or from the 2mass point source catalogue ( psc ) ; a ( 8.28@xmath0 m ) , c ( 12.13@xmath0 m ) , d ( 14.65@xmath0 m ) and e ( 21.3@xmath0 m ) flux densities from the msx6c psc ; and 12 , 25 , 60 and 100@xmath0 m photometry from the iras psc .",
    "based on these data we constructed their _ spectral energy distributions _ from the near- to the far - infrared domain , and estimated the bolometric flux by integrating , and extrapolating toward both shorter and longer wavelengths .",
    "the absolute luminosity of agb stars is still subject to debate .",
    "we have selected 41 sources detected in the direction of the galactic bulge ( gb ) and assumed a common distance to all these sources equivalent to the generally assumed distance to the galactic center of @xmath18kpc ( reid 1993 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of absolute luminosities .",
    "although a wide range of luminosities is found , however , the distribution is strongly peaked around 3500l@xmath2 .",
    "this maximum is in very good agreement with the one previously determined by other authors , who studied mainly bluer samples of agb stars in the gb ( e.g. habing et al .",
    "1985 ; blommaert et al .",
    "1998 ; jackson et al . 2002 ) and in the solar neighborhood ( knauer et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it appears that the luminosity distribution is similar throughout the galaxy and not very dependent on the colours .",
    "therefore , we assumed a common and constant luminosity of 3500l@xmath2 for all the sources as a first approximation to their real luminosity , to obtain the distance and then the galactic height @xmath3 .",
    "the position of each star in the iras two - colour diagram has been re - defined , via the following parameterization of the ` o - rich agb sequence ' :    @xmath4[12]@xmath5[25]=0.912ln@xmath6[25]@xmath5[60]=@xmath52.42 + 0.72@xmath7     of the agb stars belonging to the gb . ]    this way each star was assigned a @xmath8 value which corresponds to the nearest point on the ` o - rich agb sequence ' .",
    "thus , low values of @xmath8 correspond to objects located in the blue part of the sequence and high values of @xmath8 to those located in the red part of it .",
    "distribution as a function of @xmath8 . ]",
    "figure 3 shows the distance to the galactic plane ( @xmath9 ) as a function of the @xmath8 , excluding the gb subsample .",
    "we found a very clear trend in the sense that sources with low values of @xmath8 have a wider distribution than the redder sources .",
    "this implies that the redder part of the ` o - rich agb sequence ' must be populated mainly with objects of higher mass .",
    "distribution as a function of v@xmath10 . ]",
    "the expansion velocity ( v@xmath10 ) of the circumstellar shell has been proposed to be correlated with the progenitor mass ( baud & habing 1983 ; garca - lario 1992 ) .",
    "v@xmath10 was derived for the stars in our sample from the oh maser measurements .",
    "figure 4 shows that there is also a very clear correlation between @xmath3 and v@xmath10 in the sense that there is a deficit of stars with high v@xmath10 at high @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , among the sources with low @xmath3 most of them have high v@xmath10 . in figure 5",
    "we show that sources with high v@xmath10 are found in all areas of the ` o - rich agb sequence ' .",
    "this means that the objects with high v@xmath10 , regardless the colour , in mean must have higher progenitor masses than those with low v@xmath10 .",
    "distribution as a function of v@xmath10 . ]",
    "we conclude that the red part of the ` o - rich agb sequence ' ( high @xmath8 ) is mainly populated by sources with higher progenitor mass .",
    "in contrast , the blue part of the ` o - rich agb sequence ' is populated by a combination of agb stars of low and high progenitor mass . as objects with low progenitor mass are almost not found at high values of @xmath8 , they must abandon the agb phase without reaching the red end of the ` o - rich agb sequence ' .",
    "as a function of @xmath8 . ]    in order to search for evolutionary connections between the objects populating the ` o - rich agb sequence ' and other samples of agb stars and pne taken from the literature , we have divided the sample in bins of @xmath8 and obtained their galactic scale heights @xmath11 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the scale heights decrease with increasing @xmath8 , with particular large @xmath11 at the blue end and very low @xmath11 at the red end .",
    "we have split our sample first into 3 subsamples according to the optical thickness of their shells ( blue , transition , and red ) and split afterwards the blue and red subsamples to discuss the the evolutionary connection having particular high or low @xmath11 separately ( for details see jimnez - esteban et al .",
    "the resulting subsamples are listed in table1 .",
    "lcrrc sample & @xmath8 & n of & @xmath1h & optical + & range & stars & [ pc ] & thickness + ext .",

    "red & & 22 & 50 & thick +    the _ extremely blue _ subsample has an associated galactic scale height @xmath11 remarkably similar to that found for optically bright mira variables with short periods ( @xmath12300@xmath14 ; jura 1994 ) .",
    "o - rich type iii pne ( very low mass o - rich pne ) also have a similar mean @xmath3 ( maciel & dutra 1992 ) .",
    "the _ blue subsample _ shows a value of @xmath11 similar to that found by ortiz & maciel ( 1996 ) for their sample of oh / ir stars in the solar neighborhood , and with that obtained by wood & cahn ( 1977 ) for their sample of mira variables near the galactic plane , which is a combination of both short and long period miras .",
    "type ii pne , which are a mixture of o - rich and c - rich pn , have also similar mean @xmath3 ( maciel & dutra 1992 ) .",
    "the _ transition subsample _ populates the region in which agb stars become optically thick .",
    "this subsample has an associated @xmath11 which is consistent with the value obtained by jura & kleinmann ( 1992 ) and jura et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for intermediate- and long - period ( 300500@xmath14 ) mira variables , and by groenewegen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for a small group of low mass optically bright carbon stars .",
    "we conclude that these first three subsamples contain mira variables , with periods increasing with the value of @xmath8 .",
    "they mostly will evolve into o - rich type ii ( and iii ) pne .",
    "a fraction of the stars in the transition subsample might evolve into c - rich type ii pne .",
    "the value of @xmath11 in the _ red subsample _ is similar to the one obtained for carbon star samples which include a significant fraction of very red carbon stars ( ` infrared carbon stars ' ) .",
    "( claussen et al . 1987 ; groenewegen et al . 1992 ) .",
    "it is also similar to the mean value of @xmath3 associated to n - rich type i pn ( maciel & dutra 1992 ) .",
    "we therefore suspect that part of the stars in the red subsample change their chemical composition from o - rich to c - rich during their evolution in the agb phase as a consequence of the dredge - up processes that the theory predicts for intermediate mass stars .",
    "hot bottom burning ( hbb ) may prevent the conversion to carbon stars of the rest , ending up as n - rich type i pn .",
    "the last subsample , the _ extremely red subsample _ , has a extremely low value of @xmath11 .",
    "these objects should then represent the most massive agb stars in our galaxy .",
    "these stars must be massive enough to activate hbb .",
    "note that there is no pn class which can be associated to this subsample .",
    "it is possible that these massive stars evolve so fast that when the central star reaches the necessary temperature to ionize the envelope , the shell is still thick enough to prevent its detection as a pn in the optical .",
    "these massive agb stars may never form visible pne .",
    "rather they would evolve as ` infrared pne ' and might be related with the rare group of so - called ` ohpne ' ( zijlstra et al .",
    "1989 ) , heavily obscured sources which show both oh maser and radio continuum emission .",
