    "@xmath0(2010 ) ( @xmath8 ) production is important to understanding the production of charm because @xmath9 s are expected to dominate the charm cross - section : their spin causes them to be favored threefold over the low - lying @xmath10 mesons at high center of mass energies .",
    "charm production is an interesting topic in its own right , being calculable in perturbative qcd@xcite .",
    "there has also been interest in the intrinsic charm content of hadrons@xcite .",
    "finally , accurate simulations of charm production required by future experiments at the tevatron , the lhc , and lepton colliders will depend on these measurements which can be used to tune pythia@xcite and other monte carlo simulation packages .",
    "since @xmath9 mesons have spin  1 , we might expect the charm quark spin to be reflected in the meson .",
    "spin retention is particularly strong for heavy quarks , where the usual stiffness of the spin vector under relativistic boosts may be expected to play a part@xcite . in any case",
    ", there are many anomalies of spin and polarization .",
    "for instance , it is known that some hyperons are strongly polarized in some regions of production and not in others , the reasons for this behavior being still not completely understood@xcite .",
    "it is also known that most of the spin of the proton is not carried by the valence quarks@xcite .",
    "copious production of a vector meson provides us with a unique opportunity to add new information on polarization , and we hope that these data will shed further light on hadron physics .    in this paper , we report measurements of the production of @xmath0(2010 ) in 500  gev/@xmath1 @xmath2-nucleon interactions . forward differential cross sections and @xmath0 production asymmetries have been measured as functions of feynman - x ( @xmath4 ) and transverse momentum squared ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the measurements are compared to pythia monte carlo models .",
    "the differential distributions are fit to well - known functional forms and fit parameters are compared with previous measurements .",
    "also , spin - density matrix elements were measured , again as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "e791 , a high statistics charm physics experiment , took data at fermilab s tagged photon laboratory during the 19912 fixed - target run .",
    "the experiment  @xcite used an upgraded version of the two - magnet spectrometer previously used in e516 , e691 , and e769 .",
    "a 500  gev/@xmath1 @xmath2 beam was directed at five target foils : a 0.52  mm thick platinum foil , followed by four 1.56  mm thick carbon foils , with a typical spacing of 15  mm between foil centers .",
    "tracks and vertices used hits in 23 silicon microstrip and 45 wire chamber planes . the spectrometer included two erenkov counters , electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , and two muon scintillator walls . a loose trigger based on transverse calorimeter  @xcite energy was employed .",
    "an innovative data acquisition system  @xcite recorded @xmath11 events .",
    "the resulting 50 terabyte data set was reconstructed using large computing farms at four sites  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 sample used in this analysis was collected from the decay mode @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 candidates were obtained in the decay modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "selection criteria were chosen to optimize @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the signal and background in @xmath0 @xmath19-value histograms . here , the @xmath0 @xmath19-value is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the reconstructed @xmath0 mass , @xmath22 is the reconstructed @xmath13 mass , and @xmath23 is the charged pion mass  @xcite . owing to the high statistics of the sample and the small number of criteria used for selection , the data set was used directly for this optimization .",
    "the short lifetime of the @xmath0 makes it impossible to reconstruct a @xmath0 decay vertex separate from the primary vertex , so in what follows , the secondary vertex is defined to be the point where the @xmath13 decays , and the primary vertex to be the point where the @xmath0 and @xmath13 are produced .",
    "the longitudinal separation between the primary and secondary vertices was required to be at least @xmath24 standard deviations and @xmath25 modes . in these cases",
    "the @xmath25 cut is shown in parentheses . ] , and the secondary vertex was required to be outside any target foil .",
    "the component of the momentum vector of the @xmath13 candidate perpendicular to the line joining the primary and secondary vertices was required to be less than @xmath26 , and also the @xmath13 momentum vector was required to point back to within 0.1  mm of the primary vertex in the plane transverse to the beam . to reduce background caused by false secondary vertices or tracks",
    "being mis - assigned to the secondary vertex , it was further required that the product over all decay tracks of the ratio of the transverse impact parameter at the secondary vertex to that at the primary vertex be less than one . to further reduce background , the reconstructed mass of the @xmath13 candidate was required to fall within a mass window which was determined by creating histograms of the masses of the @xmath13 candidates separately in the various regions of @xmath0 @xmath4 and @xmath5 to which a fit was performed where the @xmath13 signal was represented by a gaussian and the background by a straight line .",
    "the limits of the mass window were chosen to be at @xmath27 on either side of the mean .",
    "owing to the small phase space available to the @xmath0 decay , the background in the @xmath19-value histogram is already low enough that no additional cuts on the @xmath0 decay pion candidates were necessary , other than basic track quality requirements applied to all decay tracks . applying the above selection criteria",
    "yields a data sample of @xmath28 @xmath0 signal events which are shown in figure  [ fig - all3al ] .",
    "for the differential cross section study , the data sample was divided into 12 bins each of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the range @xmath29",
    ", the bins have a width of 0.05 , and in the range @xmath30 the bins have a width of 0.1 . in the range @xmath31 bins",
    "have a width of 0.5  @xmath32 , and in the range @xmath33 bins have a width of 1  @xmath34 . in each bin of @xmath4 or @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath0 @xmath19-value histograms were created .",
    "random event mixing was used to model the background shape , and the background level was determined by fitting the event mixed histogram to the corresponding data histogram using a binned maximum likelihood fit in the background region ( @xmath35 ) . in the signal region ( @xmath36 )",
    "we subtract from the data histogram the scaled number of events from the event - mixed histogram to obtain the number of signal events . in this way , it is nt necessary to model the details of the signal shape to determine the number of signal events in the histogram .    to model the acceptance ,",
    "14 million monte carlo events were generated which , when reconstructed and subjected to the same selection criteria as our data , yielded approximately ten times as many @xmath0 events as in the data sample .",
    "the monte carlo samples were fit in the same way as the data to obtain a bin - by - bin efficiency estimate .",
    "the acceptance - corrected yields were used to plot the differential cross sections in figure  [ fig - formfits ] . for the @xmath4 distributions",
    ", we used data in the range @xmath37  gev@xmath38 , and for the @xmath5 distributions , @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath4 distribution was fit in the range 0.10.6 with the traditional function : @xmath40 the @xmath5 distribution was fit with the traditional function @xmath41 in the range @xmath42 and with the function @xmath43 in the full range @xmath44 .",
    "this last functional form was suggested by frixione et al.@xcite .    in figure  [ fig - formfits ] ,",
    "the e791 results are also compared to the default pythia model  @xcite and a `` tuned '' pythia model  @xcite in which parameters are adjusted to more closely model the @xmath45 production characteristics reported in an earlier e791 paper  @xcite .",
    "the results of the various fits are listed in table  [ tab - diff ] , along with results from previous experiments  @xcite .",
    ".parameters from fits to @xmath46 differential @xmath0 cross sections vs. @xmath4 and @xmath5 , including comparisons to other experiments ( @xcite ) .",
    "column labels refer to fit parameters of the same name defined by equations  . the labels `` l '' and `` nl '' refer to leading and non - leading particles , respectively",
    ". asterisks ( * ) indicate extended range of @xmath5 used in fit of equation  [ eq - ptmangano ] .",
    "errors shown on e791 results include both statistical and systematic components .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - systerr ]",
    "we have measured the differential cross sections of @xmath0 production as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . while the usual functional forms used by other experiments to parameterize their data ( equations [ eq - xf ] and [ eq - pt ] ) do not describe our data well , equation  [ eq - ptmangano ] suggested by frixione et al .",
    "provides an excellent fit over our full range of @xmath5 ( @xmath47 for 9 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the pythia model tuned for the e791 analysis of @xmath45 production does describe the @xmath5 cross section much better than the default pythia model .",
    "we observe an overall charge asymmetry which favors the leading particle as predicted by the pythia model , although our overall observed asymmetry is significantly less than predicted .",
    "we do observe an increase in asymmetry with @xmath4 as predicted by pythia and consistent with that for @xmath45 production@xcite .",
    "the asymmetry is approximately constant as a function of @xmath5 ; while it dips to zero near @xmath48 , data points in this region are also consistent with the average value .",
