    "possible scenarios for pp collisions in the tev energy domain , based on extrapolations from data and fits in the gev region to charged particle multiplicity distributions , @xmath0 , and on the weighted superposition mechanism of two classes of events , i.e. , soft ( without minijets ) and semihard ( with minijets ) , each described by a negative binomial multiplicity distribution ( nbmd ) with characteristic parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ) have been discussed both in full phase space @xcite and rapidity intervals @xcite .",
    "( for an experimental investigation of the substructures see ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "it has been pointed out that in the semihard component either with a strongly kno scaling violating mechanism ( parameter @xmath3 decreases with c.m .",
    "energy @xmath4 as @xmath5 ) or with a qcd inspired kno scaling violating behaviour , ( which is milder than the previous one as parameter @xmath3 decreases as @xmath6 ) , the average number of clans , @xmath7 , becomes smaller as the c.m .",
    "energy increases ( from @xmath8 and 22 , resp . , at 900 gev , to @xmath9 and 18 , resp . ,",
    "at 14 tev ) and the corresponding average number of particles per clan , @xmath10 , much larger ( from @xmath11 and 2.6 , resp . , at 900 gev , to @xmath12 and 5 , resp . , at 14 tev ) , favouring clan aggregation and higher average particle population within clans .",
    "this behaviour was considered suggestive and indicative of a class of events with high particle density .    motivated by this remark",
    ", we decided to explore in the same framework the consequences of an eventual more dramatic decrease of the average number of clans towards 1 , i.e. , towards a class of events with the maximum clan and particle aggregation , a situation which implies a @xmath3 value less than one but which is unfortunately met in the semihard component only asymptotically at an extraordinary high c.m.energy in the kno scaling violating extrapolations of @xmath3 .",
    "this result contrasts sharply with the main properties of the class of events belonging to the semihard component at non - asymptotic energies , where @xmath3 is always larger than or equal to one .",
    "it raises the intriguing question whether a very high clan and particle density is only an asymptotic behaviour of the semihard component , or the property of an effective new class of events , different from ( maybe harder than ) the semihard one , and whose onset might happen already at 14 tev c.m .",
    "energy : if this is the case , its contribution to the total charged particle multiplicity distribution , @xmath13 , in terms of a new weighted nb(pascal)md , should be added to those of the soft and semihard ones of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the claim is that the benchmark of this third new class of events ( called ` @xmath14 '  from now on ) is @xmath15 .",
    "it should be recalled that the average number of clans is in general a non trivial function of the average number of particles of each component , @xmath16 , and of the parameter @xmath17 , @xmath18 with @xmath19=soft , sh and @xmath14 , enumerating the three classes . whereas @xmath20 is taken constant in our scenarios in the new energy domain and therefore @xmath21 depends only on the average multiplicity @xmath22 as the c.m .",
    "energy increases , the decrease of @xmath3 with c.m .",
    "energy suggested by our assumptions on kno scaling violations remains at non - asymptotic energies always larger than or equal to one in the semihard component and is only in part contrasted by the increase of @xmath23 , a fact which outlines @xmath3 dominance in the general @xmath7 behaviour . as already mentioned the request of an average number of clans , @xmath24 , of few units in the third component leads to values of @xmath25 less than one whereas that of @xmath26 implies @xmath27 for large @xmath28 .",
    "notice that in this last extreme situation the average number of particle per clan , @xmath29 coincides of course with the average number of particles of the new component @xmath28 . in addition when @xmath30 a quite normal situation at large c.m .",
    "energies the nb(pascal)md describing the final charged particle md of the component is well approximated by a log - concave gamma md for @xmath3 larger than one which becomes an exponential when @xmath3 is equal to one : the maximum of the gamma distribution occurs at @xmath31 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] ) .",
    "this behaviour should be compared with what happens in the third component under the condition @xmath32 : in this case the nbmd is in fact well approximated by a log - convex gamma distribution which for a certain value of the above parameter close to zero leads to the average number of clans @xmath33 and to the total md well described by a logarithmic one .",
    "this result is consistent with the standard interpretation of the occurrence of the negative binomial md for final charged multiplicity at hadron level as a two step process in which the independently emitted clans contain logarithmically distributed charged particles @xcite .    finally in consequence of the assumed quite extreme clan and particle aggregation into few clans , events with quite large forward - backward multiplicity correlations close to the maximum allowed leakage from one hemisphere to the opposite one @xcite",
    "are also expected . at partonic level",
    "the mentioned remarks would suggest for the third component high parton density clan production with huge colour exchange processes originated from a relatively small number of high virtuality ancestors , which would indicate probably an emission mechanism harder than that seen in the semihard component .",
    "in conclusion it might well be that one could observe already at 14 tev c.m .",
    "energy in pp collisions three classes of events or components instead of two , the first and the second class being those examined in refs @xcite and @xcite and the third one fully characterised by the reduction of the the average number of clans to the minimum allowed by the condition @xmath15 .",
    "the classes of events or components contributing to the total @xmath34 charged particle multiplicity distributions would therefore be the following :    _ i _ ) the class of soft events ( events with no minijets ) , which in clan structure analysis would be characterised by quite large values of @xmath21 and quite small @xmath35 ; @xmath36 obeys kno scaling and @xmath20 is assumed to be constant from the gev region to the new energy domain ;    _ ii _ ) the class of semihard events ( events with minijets ) , for which @xmath7 decreases quickly with c.m .",
    "energy and @xmath37 ; @xmath3 decreases also with c.m .",
    "energy but its value is larger than or equal to one and kno scaling is violated ;    _ iii _ ) the new class of events ( events generated probably by quite hard partons ) with @xmath15 , @xmath38 ( and quite small @xmath24 ) , with large forward - backward multiplicity correlations .",
    "accordingly , the total charged particle md will have the following expression in terms of the weighted composition of the three nbmd s , one for each component : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the fraction of soft and semihard events , respectively .    at 14 tev c.m energy the weight of the third component",
    "is expected to be of course quite small , in our calculations we assumed it to be between 1 and 3 percent of the total number of events .    since the quantitative properties of the classes of soft and semihard events have been extensively discussed in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite we focus our attention in this paper on the global properties of the new class of events , which we would be tempted to call hard events .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the new class of events is described as are the soft and semihard ones by a nbmd with parameters @xmath28 and @xmath25 , we decided to examine under such conditions possible signals of new physics which should be easily detectable already at 14 tev c.m .",
    "energy in pp collisions by studying the general behaviour of the various sets of parameters characterising the final charged particles md of the component @xmath42 . in order to stress the properties of the new class of events , the extreme case @xmath43 will be discussed in the following .",
    "the request that @xmath43 , through its definition eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , leads to the straightforward relation between @xmath28 and @xmath25 : @xmath44 with ( being @xmath38 ) @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1 ] are plotted @xmath46 vs @xmath47 in kno form for @xmath43 and different average multiplicities , with the respective values of @xmath25 obtained via eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , which highlights the general trend of the exponential behaviour of the md and @xmath15 dominance .",
    "in addition we notice that for @xmath15 , as for the gamma distribution corresponding to the limit @xmath48 of the nbmd , we can distinguish two regions : @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the former a smooth behaviour of @xmath46",
    "is seen as @xmath34 increases ( events with large multiplicities ) whereas in the latter a dramatic decrease of @xmath46 is visible ( events with low multiplicities ) .",
    "the fact that the distribution decreases so slowly for @xmath49 and so fast for @xmath50 produces more easily events with very large or very small charged multiplicity , which reminds us of what occurs in cosmic rays for centauro and anti - centauro events .",
    "a provocative result to be tested in experiments .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : nclan ] are plotted @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the three components as a function of c.m .",
    "energy in full phase space : the first two components are those discussed in @xcite , notice that @xmath3 behaviour corresponds to that suggested by a strong kno scaling violation .",
    "the lack of experimental data on the third component at lower c.m.energies and the consequent impossibility to guess its behaviour in terms of extrapolations as it was done for the soft and semihard components in ref .",
    "@xcite , led us to show a band of possible values .",
    "a conservative guess that the total multiplicity variation due to the third component over the extrapolation of ref .",
    "@xcite is limited to 10% leads to @xmath28 values from 3 to 10 times larger than the total multiplicity , i.e. , to a third component weight ranging from 1 to 3% .",
    "notice that to a small variation of @xmath25 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) corresponds a quite large variation of @xmath28 .",
    "this is clearly shown in the figure , where @xmath43 whereas @xmath29 is 3 times larger in one case with respect to the other .",
    "last but not least , @xmath29 is , as assumed , much larger than in the two other components .      since @xmath54 with @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath56 it follows that @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the logarithmic distribution ) which for @xmath43 leads to @xmath59 it should be noticed that in the limit @xmath27 ( it corresponds to @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) a truncated nbmd ( i.e. , with zero multiplicity missing ) and with constant @xmath62 ( i.e. , constant @xmath63 ) leads to a logarithmic md , i.e. , to the md of a single average clan : @xmath64 this result is of course consistent with the standard interpretation of the occurrence of the nbmd as a two step process ( independently produced clans with at least one particle ancestor decay according to a logarithmic md ) when the average number of clans is reduced to one .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] are plotted the c.m .",
    "energy dependence of @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the three components which highlight the general trend of @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath67 .",
    "notice that in general , for @xmath68 , one has @xmath69 .",
    "being the probability of two particles of the hard component to join the same clan @xmath70 times larger than the probability to join two different clans @xcite it is clear that @xmath15 is enhancing particle aggregation properties within clans .",
    "being @xmath71 much larger than in the semihard component , from the relation @xmath72 two particle correlations are also expected to be larger .",
    "since cumulants are dependent on @xmath70 , which is again much larger than @xmath73 , higher order cumulants are also expected to be quite large in the third component .",
    "concerning forward - backward multiplicity correlations and leakage parameter behaviour , it should be pointed out , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the forward - backward multiplicity correlation strength is given for each component by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the average fraction of particles , within each clan , which remain in the same hemisphere where the clan was emitted and do not ` leak ' to the opposite hemisphere . in the third component , in presence of only one clan , the leakage is expected to be maximum ( @xmath76 ) ; being at the same time , as we have seen , @xmath61 , one obtains @xmath77 .",
    "accordingly forward - backward multiplicity correlations in the third component are expected to be quite stronger than in the semihard component .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the total charged particle md , @xmath0 , of the events generated with the last version of the pythia monte carlo model @xcite both in full phase space and in a restricted rapidity interval ( @xmath78 ) can not be fitted in terms of the weighted superposition of two nbmd s and that the plot of @xmath0 vs @xmath34 shows two shoulders ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mdpy ] ) .",
    "these two shoulders appearing in the total multiplicity distribution come , in our framework , from the weighted superpositions of the first with the second and of the second with the third component .",
    "this is true also in the pseudo - rapidity interval .",
    "it would be tempting to identify the third component with the hard one discussed above , but striking differences between the third class of events generated with pythia monte carlo and that one discussed above prevent us from doing this identification .",
    "an `` elbow structure '' is expected in @xmath13 as the result of the weighted superposition of the nb md of the semihard component with the gamma log - convex md of the hard one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : md3 ] .    in the figure are shown in addition to the weighted superposition of the soft with the semihard components already seen in ref @xcite the results of the weighted superposition of the semihard and hard components at 14 tev c.m .",
    "energy .",
    "it should be pointed out that similar results to those discussed so far for the extreme case @xmath43 can be obtained with a small average number of clans , provided that @xmath15 , as illustrated in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the closer @xmath25 is to 1 , the less evident becomes the elbow structure discussed above .",
    ".parameters for the third component at 14 tev , assuming two cases : ( a ) @xmath79 and ( b ) @xmath80 . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "signals of new physics could be visible in the tail of the @xmath34 charged particle multiplicity distribution @xmath0 in complete disagreement with pythia monte carlo predictions under the assumption that the aggregation of the average number of clans in the semihard component reaches its minimum not asymptotically but at lower c.m .",
    "the occurrence of this minimum would suggest the onset of a third ( maybe hard ) component to be added to the soft and semihard ones discussed in previous work .    in the paper we examined the main consequences of the occurrence of the mentioned situation already at 14 tev c.m energy in pp collision , assuming that the new class of events is between 1 and 3 percent of the total .",
