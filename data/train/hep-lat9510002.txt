    "the interaction of chiral spin-1/2 particles with gauge fields is a feature of many field - theoretic models , including the standard electroweak model .",
    "the implementation of chiral gauge theories in lattice field theory is , of course , a prerequisite to the numerical simulation of such theories ; but it is also of importance in establishing that chiral theories can be defined outside of the domain of perturbation theory .    in recent years , a number of proposals for constructing lattice versions of chiral gauge theories have been put forward . a review of the present status of many of these lattice chiral - fermion proposals has been given by shamir @xcite .",
    "some proposals @xcite have not yet been studied extensively .",
    "others , such as the eichten - preskill model @xcite , the smit - swift model @xcite , and the staggered - fermion model @xcite , apparently fail to yield a chiral fermion spectrum because of the coupling of gauge degrees of freedom to the fermion @xcite .",
    "the domain - wall proposal of kaplan @xcite and the related overlap formula of narayanan and neuberger @xcite have received a good deal of study , with encouraging results @xcite . on the other hand , it has been suggested that both of these methods might fail along the lines of the failure of the smit - swift model because gauge degrees of freedom couple to the fermion at the boundaries of the regions of nonzero gauge field @xcite .",
    "given the unsettled status of the proposals that are currently viable , it would seem to be worthwhile to consider alternative methods for formulating chiral gauge theories .    in this paper , we present a new method for constructing lattice versions of chiral gauge theories .",
    "our approach makes use of a wilson mass @xcite to remove fermion species doublers .",
    "the wilson mass breaks the chiral gauge symmetry .",
    "however , we argue that the violations of chiral symmetry that survive in the continuum limit are associated with ultraviolet- ( uv- ) divergent amplitudes and that the chiral symmetry can be partially restored through the addition of local renormalization counterterms to the action @xcite . the philosophy of using local counterterms to restore the chiral symmetry has also been suggested by the rome group @xcite .",
    "( local counterterms are required to restore the chiral symmetry in the proposal of the zaragoza group @xcite , as well . ) however , unlike the approach of the rome group , our method does not entail the tuning of counterterm coefficients .",
    "instead , we implement the counterterms by modifying the lattice definitions of the fermion determinant and operator matrix elements .    the first modification is to replace the magnitude of the fermion determinant with the square root of the determinant of a fermion with _ vector - like _ couplings to the gauge field @xcite .",
    "( a related modification of matrix elements of operators involving fermion fields is also introduced . )",
    "this redefinition of the determinant implements the renormalization counterterms that are associated with uv divergences in a single fermion loop . after this modification",
    ", the fermion determinant is gauge invariant in the presence of a background gauge field , except for contributions from the adler - bardeen - jackiw ( abj ) anomaly @xcite .",
    "these violations of chiral symmetry cancel , as usual , when one considers a theory containing a suitable complement of physical fermions .",
    "the presence of dynamical gauge fields leads to additional ultraviolet divergences and potentially requires the introduction of many new counterterms to restore the chiral gauge symmetry",
    ". we deal with this difficulty by introducing separate lattice cutoffs for the fermion fields and gauge fields @xcite . in the double limit in which the fermion cutoff is removed before the gauge - field cutoff ,",
    "the violations of chiral symmetry vanish with at least one power of the ratio of cutoffs .",
    "the use of this double limit in conjunction with the modification of the magnitude of the fermion determinant has been emphasized previously in refs .",
    "@xcite    most of the analysis in this paper is couched in weak - coupling coupling perturbation theory .",
    "however , we are able to show , by exploiting the finite radius of convergence the perturbation expansion of the fermion determinant , that our method is also valid in the presence of nonperturbative gauge - field configurations .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : doubling ]",
    "we discuss , in general terms , fermion doubling , its elimination through the use of a wilson mass , and the breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce a lattice implementation of a theory of left - handed fermions coupled to a non - abelian gauge field .",
    "although our specific analyses in subsequent sections of the paper refer to this model , our methods generalize immediately to models that contain right - handed as well as left - handed fermion fields and to models that contain scalar particles . in section  [ sec : gauge ] we discuss the nature of the violations of gauge invariance that arise from the introduction of a wilson mass .",
    "section  [ sec : background - gauge ] contains an analysis of the chiral - symmetry properties of the fermion determinant in the presence of a background gauge field .",
    "this analysis allows us to derive a modification of the determinant that restores the chiral symmetry in the case of an anomaly - free theory . in section",
    "[ sec : dynamical ] we discuss the difficulties that arise from dynamical gauge fields and present the double - limit procedure for dealing with them . in section  [ sec : operators ] we indicate how the methods used in computing the fermion determinant can also be applied in computing matrix elements of operators containing fermion fields . a proof of the validity of the methods for computing the fermion determinant and operator matrix elements in the presence of nonperturbative gauge fields is sketched in section  [ sec : nonpert ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results and discuss various options for implementing our chiral - fermion method .    while this paper was in preparation , a paper by hernndez and sundrum @xcite on the same subject appeared .",
    "the methods that these authors propose for computing the fermion determinant ( but not the matrix elements of fermion operators ) are essentially identical to the ones proposed in the present paper .",
    "many of the conclusions drawn in the present paper and in ref .",
    "@xcite are the same ; one exception is noted at the end of section  [ sec : counting - a - f ] .",
    "however , the details of the proofs in the two papers are , in general , quite different .",
    "it is well known that the most straightforward transcription of the dirac operator to the lattice is problematic because of the phenomenon of fermion doubling : for each left- or right - handed particle in the continuum theory , there are @xmath0 left - handed and @xmath0 right - handed particles in the lattice theory , where @xmath1 is the dimensionality of space - time @xcite .    for the case of qcd , wilson @xcite suggested that one could remove the doublers by giving them a mass that goes to infinity as the lattice spacing @xmath2 goes to zero .",
    "of course , the introduction of a mass explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "however , this is not expected to present a serious problem in qcd , since the gauge symmetry remains intact .",
    "consequently , the renormalization program is unaffected and one should recover the continuum theory as the lattice regulator is removed ( @xmath3 ) .    in the case of a chiral gauge theory , the introduction of a wilson mass has more serious consequences .",
    "for such a theory , the wilson mass and , hence , the uv regulator break the gauge symmetry , thereby jeopardizing the renormalization program and the decoupling of unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "a failure of the gauge degrees of freedom to decouple may lead to an alteration of the low - energy spectrum of the theory .",
    "for example , under such circumstances , when one integrates over the gauge degrees of freedom , a chiral gauge theory can become a vector - like gauge theory @xcite .    in a chiral theory",
    ", one can not completely avoid such a breaking of the gauge symmetry .",
    "there are several no - go theorems which state , under a variety of assumptions , that any gauge theory that does not exhibit fermion doubling must violate chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "one can argue this very generally on the basis of the properties of the abj anomaly .",
    "if a lattice theory preserves a chiral symmetry , then the corresponding chiral current is conserved . in particular , the triangle anomaly is zero and remains zero in the continuum limit .",
    "but , according to the proof of adler and bardeen @xcite , there is no lorentz - covariant bose - symmetric counterterm that removes the anomaly in the triple - chiral - current green s function for a theory containing a single fermion species .",
    "that is , there is no uv regulator under which the anomaly vanishes as the regulator is removed .",
    "hence , a lattice regulator that preserves the chiral symmetry must cancel the anomaly through the presence of multiple fermion species , _",
    "i.e. _ doubling . note that this argument leaves open the possibility that one might eliminate the doubling in a way such that the violations of chiral symmetry arise _ solely _ from the abj anomaly .",
    "such a result is our goal .    in employing continuum perturbative uv regulators , such as dimensional regularization , one deals with violations of a chiral gauge symmetry by adding counterterms order by order in perturbation theory so as to restore the chiral symmetry in selected green s functions .",
    "the remaining violations of the chiral symmetry arise from the abj anomaly and cancel when one introduces an appropriate complement of physical fermion species .",
    "such an order - by - order approach is , of course , incompatible with a nonperturbative regularization of the theory .",
    "however , one might still hope to effect a restoration of the chiral symmetry by introducing local counterterms with appropriate coefficients .",
    "a heuristic argument in support of this idea is the following .",
    "suppose that we have introduced a wilson mass term .",
    "then , the lattice spectrum for the non - interacting theory is identical to the continuum spectrum in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "suppose also that we have fixed to a renormalizable gauge .",
    "then , the magnitude of the gauge field is much less than order @xmath4 , unless a source of the gauge field has momentum of order @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , for field momenta much less than @xmath4 , the interacting lattice action approaches the continuum action in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the conclusion is that the lattice , in this case , is simply a uv regulator .",
    "it follows that the differences between the lattice regularization and any other uv regularization must reside at loop momenta on the order of the uv cutoff of the theory .",
    "hence , the differences must arise at short distances ( @xmath5 ) ; that is , they have the form of local interactions .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , if there exists a satisfactory uv regularization of a chiral gauge theory ( that is , one that respects the chiral gauge symmetry ) , then it must be equivalent to the ( wilson ) lattice - regularized theory , plus local counterterms . furthermore , if we find such a theory , it is unique , up to gauge - invariant counterterms , which merely renormalize the coupling constant .",
    "now let us discuss the lattice implementation of a specific model : a left - handed fermion coupled to a non - abelian gauge field . as we have already mentioned , the techniques that we present are easily generalizable to models containing right - handed fermions and/or scalar particles .",
    "we assume that the gauge - field part of the ( euclidean ) action has the standard plaquette form @xmath6 where , as usual ,    [ plaquette ] @xmath7,\\ ] ] @xmath8\\ ] ]    are the lattice link variables , @xmath9 is the gauge field , @xmath10 is a gauge - group matrix in the fundamental representation , @xmath11 is the gauge - field coupling , @xmath2 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath12 is a unit vector in the @xmath13  direction .",
    "initially , we introduce the fermion through the `` naive '' lattice action for a dirac particle : @xmath14 , \\label{naive - action}\\ ] ] where the @xmath15 s are euclidean dirac matrices satisfying @xmath16 . note that , in contrast with some formulations of chiral theories , our approach retains both left- and right - handed components in the fermion field .",
    "the chiral nature of the theory arises from the coupling to gauge fields , which involves only the left - handed dirac component : @xmath17\\psi(x+a_\\mu ) } -[u_\\mu^\\dagger(x - a_\\mu)-1]\\psi(x - a_\\mu)\\ } , \\label{naive - gauge}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "( in four dimensions , @xmath21 . )",
    "the fermion propagator corresponding to the naive action is @xmath22^{-1 } , \\label{naiveprop}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the incoming fermion momentum .",
    "the order @xmath11 and order @xmath24 gauge - field vertices that arise from the gauging of the naive action are    @xmath25,\\ ] ]    @xmath26,\\ ] ]    where the @xmath27 s are the vertices that arise from the gauging of the naive lattice action for a theory of fermions with vector - like couplings to an abelian gauge field . here",
    "@xmath28 are the gauge - group matrices , @xmath29 are the gauge - field indices , @xmath30 are the polarization indices , and @xmath31 are the incoming momenta , all of which are associated respectively with the gauge fields .",
    "the incoming fermion momentum is @xmath23 .",
    "the vertices of higher order in @xmath11 can be obtained conveniently from the recursion relation @xmath32 where @xmath33    in addition to the usual pole at @xmath34 , the naive propagator ( [ naiveprop ] ) has extra poles when one or more momentum components are equal to @xmath35 .",
    "it can be seen that half of the poles have positive chiral charge and half have negative chiral charge @xcite .",
    "thus , this doubling phenomenon leads to gauge - field couplings to both left- and right - handed species ; the theory , at this stage , is not chiral .",
    "we follow the standard approach of eliminating the doublers by including a wilson mass term @xcite in the action : @xmath36 .",

    "now the fermion propagator is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fourier transform of the wilson mass : @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{wilson - mass}\\ ] ] the additional vertices that arise from the gauging of the wilson term are    [ vert - wilson ] @xmath41,\\ ] ] @xmath42,\\ ] ]    where the higher - order contributions can again be obtained from the recursion relation ( [ recursion ] ) .",
    "we see that the propagator ( [ prop - wilson ] ) now has a pole only at @xmath34 .",
    "this would seem to leave us , as desired , with a single dirac particle with only left - handed couplings to the gauge field . unfortunately , the wilson terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 , having the dirac structures of masses , lead to a nonconservation of the left - handed vector current by coupling the right - handed component of the dirac field back into the theory .",
    "this implies that the chiral gauge invariance of the theory is broken",
    ".    such violations of the chiral gauge symmetry cause serious difficulties .",
    "gauge invariance is an important ingredient in the standard renormalization program . without it ,",
    "there is an explosion of new counterterms . for example , in the absence of current conservation , the vacuum polarization can generate a quadratically divergent gauge - boson mass , the light - by - light graph requires counterterms , lorentz - noncovariant counterterms can arise on the lattice , and , in non - abelian theories , the gauge - boson  fermion coupling can become different from the triple - gauge - boson coupling . in order to recover a satisfactory theory of chiral fermions coupled to massless gauge bosons , one would need to tune all of these counterterms in such a way as to restore the chiral current conservation .",
    "this is required , for example , to obtain a massless gauge boson and to guarantee that ghost fields decouple and that unitarity is preserved .",
    "on the other hand , we note that the wilson mass ( [ wilson - mass ] ) and vertices ( [ vert - wilson ] ) have the property that they vanish in the continuum limit @xmath3 for fixed momenta : they are lattice artifacts .",
    "consequently , we expect the violations of the gauge symmetry generated by the wilson mass to vanish , except when momenta of the order the lattice cutoff @xmath35 are important .",
    "that is , we expect that , in the continuum limit , the violations of the chiral gauge symmetry in the green s functions of the theory will persist only in uv - divergent feynman diagrams and subdiagrams .",
    "in order to test this expectation , let us examine in more detail the nature of the violations of the gauge symmetry that result from the introduction of a wilson mass .",
    "an infinitesimal transformation of the gauge field    [ gauge - tx ] @xmath45 can be compensated , so as to leave @xmath46 unchanged , by a transformation of the left - handed component of the fermion field : @xmath47\\psi(x),\\nonumber\\\\ \\overline\\psi(x)&\\rightarrow & \\overline\\psi(x)[1-ip_r\\lambda(x ) ] .",

    "there is a @xmath49-fermion vertex    [ var - rules ] @xmath50 and there are @xmath49-gauge - field - fermion vertices involving @xmath51 gauge bosons , @xmath52    here , @xmath10 is the gauge - group matrix associated with the gauge transformation @xmath49 , @xmath53 is the incoming momentum associated with the gauge transformation , @xmath23 is the incoming fermion momentum , and the @xmath54 are the incoming gauge - field momenta .",
    "note that the @xmath49  vertices ( [ var - rules ] ) contain factors of @xmath11 only for the gauge fields , not for the @xmath49  fields .",

    ", we will frequently make use of the fact that theories with vector - like couplings to the gauge field exhibit a gauge invariance , even in the presence of a wilson mass term . a theory with vector - like couplings to the gauge field can be obtained by setting @xmath57 in the action ( [ naive - action ] ) , ( [ naive - gauge ] ) , ( [ wilson - action ] ) , ( [ wilson - gauge ] ) .",
    "then , if one sets @xmath57 in the gauge transformation ( [ gauge - tx ] ) , the gauge variation ( [ gauge - var ] ) and the @xmath49  vertices ( [ var - rules ] ) vanish , as expected . note , however , that the gauge symmetry is violated if one drops the gauging of the wilson term ( [ wilson - gauge ] ) from the action , as can be seen from examination of ( [ gauge - var - wilson ] ) and ( [ var - nogauge - mass - vert ] ) .    there is also a property of the @xmath49  vertices that will be crucial for our subsequent analysis .",
    "the @xmath49  vertices are linear combinations of either wilson masses or wilson vertices .",
    "consequently , they all vanish in the continuum limit @xmath58 for fixed momenta .",
    "thus , the gauge variations can persist in the limit @xmath59 only if momenta of order the lattice cutoff @xmath35 are important , that is , only in divergent feynman diagrams .",
    "as a first step in identifying and dealing with the violations of gauge symmetry in the green s functions of the chiral theory , let us consider the case of fermion amplitudes in the presence of background gauge fields in which the momentum of a gauge - field quantum is limited be much less in magnitude than the lattice momentum cutoff @xmath35 .",
    "first let us consider , in the limit @xmath3 , the size of the contribution from a fermion loop containing zero or one gauge - variation ( @xmath49 ) vertices and any number of background gauge - field vertices .",
    "we will analyze , in turn , the region of integration in which the magnitude of the loop momentum is much smaller than @xmath35 and the region of integration in which the magnitude of the loop momentum is of order @xmath35 .",
    "as we have seen , a @xmath49  vertex vanishes in the limit @xmath60 unless momenta of order @xmath35 are important .",
    "thus , we expect that a loop containing a @xmath49  vertex will receive a vanishing contribution from the region of integration in which the magnitude of the loop momentum is much smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "since the external gauge - field momenta are assumed to be much smaller than @xmath35 , one can take the @xmath3 limit in this region simply by taking the @xmath3 limits of the propagators and vertices , holding momenta fixed . in this limit ,",
    "propagators and naive single - gauge - field vertices go over to continuum propagators and vertices , which are @xmath2  independent , while multi - gauge - field naive vertices , wilson vertices , and @xmath49  vertices vanish as at least one power of @xmath2 . furthermore , since the trace of an odd number of @xmath15  matrices vanishes , a @xmath49  vertex is always paired with a wilson vertex or a wilson term in a propagator numerator .",
    "the volume of integration in this region is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we conclude , that a loop that contains a @xmath49  vertex receives a contribution from this region of integration that vanishes as at least two powers of @xmath2 in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "now we consider the region of integration in which the magnitude of the loop momentum is of order @xmath35 .",
    "we can determine whether this is an important region of integration by examining the sizes of the propagators , vertices , and the domain of integration .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for further details . )",
    "away from its pole at the origin , the propagator ( [ prop - wilson ] ) is of order @xmath2 . here , it is crucial that we have eliminated doublers ; otherwise , there would be poles in the propagator for components of the loop momentum of order @xmath35 .",
    "an @xmath61-gauge - field - fermion vertex is of order @xmath62 , and a @xmath49-@xmath61-gauge - field - fermion vertex is of order @xmath62 .",
    "the domain of integration is of order @xmath63 in @xmath1 dimensions . from this",
    "it follows that the region in which the magnitude of the fermion - loop momentum is of order @xmath35 gives a contribution of order @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the number of external gauge fields .",
    "note that this result is independent of the number of @xmath49  vertices .",
    "] we define the degree of divergence of a loop to be @xmath66 which corresponds to the expression in continuum field theory .",
    "if the loop is uv convergent , that is , if @xmath67 is negative , then the contribution from the region in which the magnitude of the loop momentum is of order @xmath35 vanishes as a power of @xmath2 in the limit @xmath3 . in this case , for a loop containing no @xmath49  vertices , the contribution from the region in which the magnitude of the loop momentum is much less than @xmath35 dominates .",
    "one can obtain the @xmath68 limit of this contribution by replacing the integrand with the continuum expression .",
    "the resulting integral is uv convergent , and so one can extend the range of integration to infinity with negligible error .",
    "hence , the @xmath3 limit of this contribution is identical to the continuum amplitude .",
    "we conclude that a fermion loop containing a @xmath49  vertex gives a vanishing contribution in the limit @xmath3 , unless the degree of divergence is non - negative .",
    "hence , for @xmath69 , the gauge variations that persist in the continuum limit arise only from loops involving a @xmath49  vertex and four or fewer external gauge - field vertices .    using these same arguments , we can also conclude that a term in a loop amplitude that is proportional to a wilson mass or vertex gives a contribution that vanishes as a power of @xmath2 in the limit @xmath60 , unless the degree of divergence of the loop is non - negative .",
    "furthermore , in the case a non - negative degree of divergence , the dominant contribution comes from the region of integration in which the loop momentum is of order @xmath35 .",
    "that is , the contribution takes the form of a local interaction , with configuration - space size of the order of the inverse of the lattice uv cutoff @xmath35 .      at this point",
    "we could attempt to restore the gauge symmetry by adding renormalization counterterms to the theory .",
    "of course , no counterterm can remove violations of the gauge symmetry that arise from the abj anomaly .",
    "partly because of the absence of full rotational symmetry on the lattice , the number of possible counterterms is quite large .",
    "in addition to the usual rotationally invariant gauge - field wave - function renormalization , there are counterterms corresponding to a gauge - field mass , a rotationally non - invariant wave - function renormalization , and rotationally invariant and non - invariant gauge - field  gauge - field scattering amplitudes .",
    "the tuning of all of these counterterms in a lattice simulation would be awkward .",
    "fortunately , there is a trick that can be used to implement the required counterterms automatically @xcite .",
    "motivated by the fact that a theory with vector - like couplings of the fermion to the gauge field is gauge invariant , we will attempt to rearrange the fermion - loop amplitude so that it looks like the loop amplitude for a vector - like theory .",
    "consider an arbitrary fermion - loop amplitude .",
    "we can write the projectors @xmath70 , which appear only in the naive vertices , in terms of the unit matrix and @xmath71 and expand the expression for the amplitude .",
    "the result is a sum , each term of which contains an even or an odd number of factors of @xmath71 .      for those terms that contain an even number of @xmath71 s , which we call even - parity terms",
    ", we would like to move the factors of @xmath71 together and use the identity @xmath20 to eliminate them , thereby obtaining the corresponding expression for a vector - like theory .",
    "this would amount to a simple algebraic manipulation , were it not for the fact that @xmath71 anticommutes with the naive terms in the rationalized - propagator numerators and naive vertices , but commutes with the wilson terms in the rationalized - propagator numerators and wilson vertices .",
    "we would obtain a result that is proportional to the corresponding expression in a vector - like theory were we to treat @xmath71 as if it anticommuted with the wilson terms in the rationalized - propagator numerators and wilson vertices .",
    "we will follow this procedure .",
    "of course , the resulting expression will differ from the original one , and we must account for this difference . however , the difference is always proportional to a wilson mass from a propagator numerator or a wilson vertex . as we have demonstrated in section  [ sec : divergent ] , a loop containing a wilson mass or vertex vanishes as at least one power of @xmath2 in the limit @xmath3 , unless the degree of divergence is non - negative , and then the contribution corresponds to a local interaction .",
    "thus , such contributions have the form of renormalization counterterms .",
    "we can drop them without affecting the nature of the theory : such a procedure amounts merely to adding renormalization counterterms to the action and choosing a particular tuning of the counterterm coefficients . then",
    ", for the terms in the original loop amplitude that contained an even number of @xmath71 s we obtain expressions that are proportional to the corresponding expressions in a vector - like theory .",
    "we now work out the constants of proportionality .",
    "consider first a contribution from a loop amplitude that contains at least one naive vertex .",
    "we are interested only in manipulating the terms containing an even number of @xmath71 s .",
    "however , it is simplest to work out the combinatorics by moving the complete projectors @xmath72 until they stand next to each other , treating @xmath71 as if it commuted with all other factors in the amplitude .",
    "each projector is separated by @xmath73 propagators and @xmath73 vertices from another , and so , in the process of moving one projector so that it is adjacent to another , the projector flips from a @xmath72 to a @xmath74 , but always winds up as a @xmath72 in the end . since @xmath75",
    ", we have just one projector @xmath70 when the process is finished .",
    "the even - parity part of the amplitude corresponds to the term @xmath76 .",
    "thus the even - parity part yields a contribution that is exactly half the corresponding contribution in a vector - like theory .",
    "now consider a contribution from a loop amplitude that contains no naive vertices . in this case",
    ", there are no projectors @xmath72 , the contribution is entirely even in parity , and it is equal to the corresponding contribution in a vector - like theory . in order to combine it with the even - parity parts of the contributions containing at least one naive vertex , so as to obtain a complete vector - like amplitude , we must discard half . however , since the discarded piece contains no naive vertices , it must contain at least one wilson vertex .",
    "as we have already argued , we can safely discard such a contribution , since that act amounts to choosing a particular tuning of the coefficients of renormalization counterterms .    at the end of all of these manipulations ,",
    "the even - parity part of a fermion - loop amplitude yields a contribution that is half the corresponding contribution in a vector - like theory .",
    "the effective action that one obtains by integrating over the fermion degrees of freedom is , of course , given by the loop amplitudes , weighted by @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the effect of our manipulations is to replace the even - parity part of the contribution to the effective action by one half the effective action for a vector - like theory .",

    "( here we are assuming that the interpolated gauge field is bounded , which may not be true in the presence of singularities of the type discussed by shamir @xcite . ) therefore , in the case of a discontinuous gauge field , the equations of motion can not be satisfied in the continuum limit , and one concludes that the gauge field does not satisfy minimization criterion in the continuum limit .    in four dimensions ,",
    "there are two more steps in the interpolation method .",
    "the third step is to determine the fields inside the cubes bounded by the elementary plaquettes .",
    "one does this by seeking a field configuration that minimizes the three - dimensional pure gauge - field action , subject to the boundary conditions along the elementary plaquettes and the three - dimensional lorentz - gauge condition .",
    "the last step is to determine the fields inside the four - dimensional hypercubes bounded by the three - dimensional cubes .",
    "one minimizes the four - dimensional pure gauge - field action , using the fields on the cubes as boundary conditions and fixing to the four - dimensional lorentz gauge .",
    "it is easy to see , by generalizing the preceding arguments , that these last two steps result in fields that satisfy the smoothness requirement .",
    "finally , there is the question of whether this interpolation method satisfies the gauge - covariance requirement .",
    "suppose that we have obtained a field configuration on the fermion lattice by the interpolation method .",
    "then suppose that we make a gauge transformation on the gauge - field lattice .",
    "the links bounding the elementary plaquettes will be changed in value , and a re - application of the interpolation procedure will result in a new field configuration on the fermion lattice .",
    "we wish to show that this new field configuration can be obtained by a gauge transformation on the fermion lattice of the original fermion - lattice field configuration . here",
    ", we paraphrase the argument presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have already shown that there is a gauge transformation that does this for the gauge fields that lie on the links bounding the elementary plaquettes on the gauge - field lattice .",
    "such a gauge transformation will not , in general , leave the gauge fields that lie inside the plaquettes in the two - dimensional lorentz gauge . however",
    ", we can always make a gauge transformation on the _ interior _ of a plaquette that returns the fields to the lorentz gauge , without changing the fields on the links that bound the plaquette .",
    "similarly , we can find a gauge transformation on the interior of a three - dimensional cube that returns the fields inside the cube to the three - dimensional lorentz gauge and a gauge transformation on the interior of a four - dimensional hypercube that returns the fields inside the hypercube to the four - dimensional lorentz gauge .",
    "since the pure gauge - field actions are invariant under these transformations , the resulting configuration still satisfies the minimization criteria .",
    "hence , it is identical to the field obtained by applying the interpolation method to the gauge - transformed gauge - field - lattice links .",
    "here we are assuming the uniqueness of the interpolated field configuration .      by considering the fourier transform of the lattice action",
    ", one can easily derive the feynman rules for the double - limit procedure .",
    "the feynman rules for the gauge - field propagators and vertices are the same as those for a theory with lattice spacing @xmath102 .",
    "momenta in propagators and vertices range from @xmath188 to @xmath137 , and momentum is conserved modulo @xmath189 . hence , pure gauge - field loop integrations range from @xmath188 to @xmath137 .",
    "the feynman rules for fermion propagators , gauge - field - fermion vertices , and @xmath49-fermion vertices are determined by considering the fourier transform of the fermionic part of the action .",
    "momenta in propagators and vertices range from @xmath190 to @xmath141 and momentum is conserved modulo @xmath191 . hence , pure fermionic loop integrations range from @xmath190 to @xmath141 .",
    "when a gauge - field line attaches to a fermion line , one must consider the effect of the interpolation in working out the fourier transform of the gauge field on the fermion lattice , as in ( [ fourier - tx ] ) .",
    "the interpolation introduces a regulating factor @xmath135 for each connection of a gauge - field line to a fermion line .",
    "the gauge - field momentum @xmath140 , which appears in the fourier transform of the gauge field on the fermion lattice ( [ fourier - tx ] ) , can be written as @xmath192 where @xmath193 takes on values from @xmath194 to @xmath195 in integer steps and @xmath196 .",
    "we can think of the integration over @xmath140 from @xmath190 to @xmath141 as an integration over @xmath197 from @xmath188 to @xmath137 and a sum over @xmath193 from @xmath194 to @xmath195 .",
    "there is an integration over @xmath197 and a sum over @xmath193 for each attachment of a gauge - field or @xmath49  line to a fermion line .",
    "the quantity @xmath197 may be interpreted as the gauge - field momentum variable in the fourier transform of the gauge field on the gauge - field lattice ( [ gauge - lattice - tx ] ) .",
    "only @xmath197 appears in gauge - field propagators and pure gauge - field vertices ; they are insensitive to the value of @xmath193 because , as can be seen from ( [ gauge - lattice - tx ] ) they are periodic , with period @xmath189 . in a feynman diagram ,",
    "integrations over variables of the type @xmath197 are constrained by the fact that the total of the gauge - field momentum , including the variables of the type @xmath197 , is conserved , modulo @xmath189 , in _ every _ propagator and vertex .",
    "thus , the gauge - field - momentum variables , including those of the type @xmath197 , can be re - organized , in the usual way , into independent loop momenta , which range from @xmath188 to @xmath137 , and external momenta . in general",
    ", the fermion propagators , gauge - field - fermion vertices , and @xmath49  vertices depend on the value of @xmath193 , as well as on the value of @xmath197 .",
    "the sums over variables of the type @xmath193 are constrained only by momentum conservation , modulo @xmath191 , along each fermion line . aside from this constraint",
    ", there is an independent sum over @xmath193 for each attachment of a gauge - field line to a fermion line .    using these feynman rules and ( [ f - cont - prop ] )",
    ", we see that , in the limit @xmath105 , for momenta much less than the cutoff @xmath137 , the feynman rules for the fermion become the continuum feynman rules .",
    "therefore , we recover the required low - energy behavior of the tree - level amplitudes .      in this section",
    "we will demonstrate , for an open fermion line or for the odd - parity part of a closed fermion line , that contributions that arise when gauge - field ( or @xmath49-field ) momenta of order @xmath141 enter the line vanish in the limit @xmath104 with @xmath102 fixed .",
    "we call momenta of order @xmath141 `` large '' momenta . in the arguments to follow",
    ", we assume that the even - parity parts of fermion loops have been modified as in section  [ sec : even ] to render them exactly gauge invariant .",
    "one consequence of this assumption is that all of the gauge variations must arise from the odd - parity parts of loops .",
    "the argument that we present holds in two and four dimensions .",
    "we proceed by counting the powers of @xmath103 associated with a contribution in which large gauge - field ( or @xmath49-field ) momenta enter a fermion line .    in the initial discussion , we assume that the fermion - loop momentum associated with a closed fermion line is not large .",
    "since momentum is conserved , modulo @xmath191 , along a fermion line , if one gauge - field momentum entering a fermion line is large , at least one other gauge - field momentum entering a fermion line must be large .",
    "we assume , initially , that exactly two gauge - field momenta entering a fermion line are large .",
    "powers of @xmath103 arise from the fermion propagators , gauge - field - fermion vertices , and @xmath49  vertices through which the large momentum flows .",
    "it is easy to see , by making use of the power - counting rules of section  [ sec : divergent ] , that the minimum number of factors of @xmath103 arises if the large gauge - field momentum flows through at most one fermion propagator .",
    "inverse powers of @xmath103 can arise from the sum over variables of the type @xmath193 in ( [ mom - decomp ] ) .",
    "if two gauge - field momenta entering a fermion line are large , there is only one independent sum , the other sum being constrained by momentum conservation .",
    "the range of the sum contributes a factor of order @xmath198 for each component of the momentum that is large .",
    "there is a regulator factor @xmath199 associated with each of the points at which the two large momenta enter the fermion line . from ( [ f - cutoff - prop ] ) , we see that each regulator factor contributes a factor @xmath103 for each component of the momentum that is large . hence , the minimum number of powers of @xmath103 is obtained by taking only one component of the momentum to be large .    by way of illustration ,",
    "let us consider the case in which the large gauge - field momentum flows through exactly one fermion propagator .",
    "as we have already noted , this case gives the minimum number of powers of @xmath103 .",
    "the fermion propagator contributes a factor of order @xmath200 .",
    "the large momentum also flows through two gauge - field - fermion vertices or a gauge - field - fermion vertex and a @xmath49  vertex .",
    "the gauge - field - fermion vertices contribute factors of order @xmath146 and the @xmath49  vertex contributes a factor of order @xmath147 .",
    "hence , the propagators and vertices contribute a factor of order @xmath200 in the amplitude and @xmath146 in the gauge variation .",
    "if we take one component of the gauge - field momentum to be large , the range of the sum over @xmath193 gives @xmath147 and the regulator factors give @xmath201 .",
    "we conclude that , in this example , the contribution to the amplitude from the factors associated with the large gauge - field momenta is of order @xmath201 .",
    "the contribution to the gauge variation is larger  of order @xmath200 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the large momentum associated with the @xmath49  field contributes an additional dimensionful factor of @xmath202 to the gauge variation .",
    "since the contributions to the amplitude itself from this momentum region vanish as @xmath201 , we can still conclude that the amplitude differs from a gauge - invariant expression by terms of order @xmath201 .",
    "now let us relax the assumption that only two of the gauge - field momenta entering the fermion line are large .",
    "for each additional large momentum , there is at least one factor @xmath103 for the propagators and vertices through which it flows , a factor @xmath147 for the associated sum over @xmath193 , and a factor @xmath103 from the associated regulator factor .",
    "hence , contributions involving more than two large gauge - field momenta are suppressed by at least one additional power of @xmath103 .",
    "we can also relax the assumption that the fermion - loop momentum associated with a closed fermion line is not large .",
    "suppose that the loop momentum is large .",
    "then , the entire contribution of the loop , including the sums over variables of the type @xmath193 and the regulator factors , arises from short distances and can be expressed in terms of local operators on the gauge - field lattice .",
    "consider first the case of loops containing gauge variations ( @xmath49  vertices ) .",
    "all of the gauge variations arise from odd - parity loops . as we have already discussed in section  [ sec : odd ] , the lattice - rotationally invariant , odd - parity , local operators of dimension @xmath1 or less involving a @xmath49  field are of the form of the abj anomaly .",
    "( in the present case , continuum derivatives must be replaced by lattice derivatives on the gauge - field lattice , since we are really discussing the effective theory on the gauge - field lattice . )",
    "these all vanish if the anomaly - cancellation condition ( [ anom - cancel ] ) is satisfied .",
    "there are no such operators of dimension @xmath203 .",
    "hence , the contributions to the gauge variations from the regions of integration in which both the gauge - field momenta and the fermion - loop moment are large are of order @xmath201 , possibly times logarithms of @xmath103 .",
    "now consider the odd - parity parts of loop amplitudes .",
    "recalling our arguments of section  [ sec : odd ] ( and again replacing continuum derivatives by derivatives on the gauge - field lattice ) , we note that the lattice - rotationally invariant , local , odd - parity operators of dimension @xmath1 or less involving only gauge fields all vanish under bose symmetrization .",
    "furthermore , there are no lattice - rotationally invariant , odd - parity , local operators of dimension @xmath203 involving only gauge fields .",
    "hence , the contributions to the odd - parity loop amplitudes from the regions of integration in which both gauge - field momenta and the fermion - loop moment are large are of order @xmath201 , possibly times logarithms of @xmath103 .",
    "finally , we consider the even - parity parts of loop amplitudes . because the even - parity parts of loops are exactly gauge invariant , only gauge - invariant local operators can contribute .",
    "there _ is _ a lattice - rotationally invariant , gauge - invariant , bose - symmetric operator of dimension @xmath1 , namely , the one that renormalizes the gauge - field wave function .",
    "hence , there could , in principle , be contributions , in which large gauge - field momenta flow into the even - parity parts of loops , that go as @xmath146 , possibly times logarithms of @xmath103 .",
    "of course , we need not show that such contributions vanish in order to establish the gauge invariance of the double - limit procedure .",
    "furthermore , their behavior is no worse than that of the even - parity parts of fermion loops in the absence of large gauge - field momenta , which is also logarithmic in @xmath103 .",
    "we must also consider the possibility that , in a feynman diagram , inverse powers of @xmath103 could arise from a fermion loop other than the fermion line under consideration , and thereby lead to contributions from regions of large gauge - field momenta that are nonvanishing as @xmath104 .",
    "we have already seen that such inverse powers of @xmath103 can not arise when gauge - field momenta entering the loop are large and or when both gauge - field momenta and the fermion - loop momentum are large .",
    "the local - operator argument given for the latter case also applies when only the fermion - loop momentum is large .",
    "therefore , no inverse powers of @xmath103 can arise from a fermion loop .",
    "let us summarize these results .",
    "we have found that , in the double limit , contributions in which a large gauge - field momentum enters a fermion loop containing a gauge variation vanish as @xmath103 times logarithms of @xmath103 .",
    "this result , combined with the analysis of section  [ sec : background - gauge ] , allows us to conclude that the odd - parity parts of fermion loops can be rendered gauge invariant by taking the double limit and by requiring the fermion to be in a representation of the gauge group that satisfies the anomaly - cancellation condition .",
    "we assume that the even - parity parts of fermion loops have been rendered exactly gauge invariant by replacing them with one - half the corresponding loop for a fermion with a vector - like coupling to the gauge field .",
    "therefore , we have achieved our goal of making all the amplitudes in the theory gauge invariant .",
    "we have also found that contributions associated with the odd - parity parts of loops are finite in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "this implies that the phase of the fermion determinant is finite in this limit .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that the contributions in which a large gauge - field momentum enter the odd - parity part of a fermion loop vanish as @xmath201 , possibly times logarithms of @xmath103 .",
    "this result , together with the analysis of section  [ sec : odd ] , implies that the phase of the fermion determinant differs from a gauge - invariant expression by terms of order @xmath201 , possibly times logarithms of @xmath103 , in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "it should be noted that the detailed power - counting rules we have presented in this subsection are specific to interpolations of the gauge fields that are discontinuous in at least one direction at the boundaries of the gauge - field hypercubes .",
    "one might devise smoother interpolations in which the gauge fields ( or their higher derivatives ) are continuous .",
    "for such interpolations , the regulating factor @xmath135 and , hence , the contributions to the amplitudes and gauge variations would be suppressed by additional factors of @xmath103 when gauge - field - fermion - loop momenta are of order @xmath141 .",
    "it may be useful to contrast our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "the authors make the additional assumption that the interpolation is transversely continuous .",
    "( that assumption is valid for the interpolations that we have presented . )",
    "they are then able to show that the all the contributions in which a large gauge - field momentum enters a fermion loop are suppressed by powers of @xmath103 .",
    "their proof applies to the even - parity parts of loops , as well as to the odd - parity parts of loops and to loops containing @xmath49  vertices .",
    "they conclude , as we do , that contributions in which large gauge - field momenta enter the odd - parity parts of loops vanish as @xmath201 .",
    "however , they also conclude that gauge variations vanish as @xmath201 .",
    "this last result seems to be at odds with our explicit example .      in the last section we demonstrated that there exists a satisfactory procedure for computing the fermion determinant .",
    "there are actually several variants of this procedure that one can employ , and some may be more efficient than others in practical calculations .",
    "we now discuss some of these computational options .",
    "once one has replaced the magnitude of the fermion determinant with the square root of the determinant for a fermion with vector - like couplings to the gauge field , the magnitude of the fermion determinant has an exact gauge invariance .",
    "therefore , one can evaluate the modified magnitude of the determinant without employing the double - limit procedure , and still obtain a gauge - invariant result .",
    "that result will be equivalent to the one obtained through the doubling - limit procedure , since the effective action is unique , aside from gauge - invariant counterterms , which can always be absorbed into a redefinition of the coupling constant .",
    "there are several advantages in calculating the magnitude of the fermion determinant without making use of the double - limit procedure .",
    "there is the obvious advantage that one would not be faced in a numerical simulation with the computational burden of taking the limit @xmath104 for each gauge - field configuration .",
    "another advantage follows from the fact that , in four dimensions , the magnitude of the determinant is divergent in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "the divergence arises from the diagram with two external gauge fields , which generates the logarithm of @xmath103 that is associated with the gauge - field wave - function renormalization . in the double - limit procedure",
    ", one would need to add a wave - function - renormalization counterterm , which has the effect of replacing @xmath204 with @xmath205 , to obtain the correct renormalization of the gauge - field - fermion coupling and to obtain a finite result .",
    "this counterterm can be determined from a one - loop calculation , since radiative corrections to the fermion loop with two external gauge fields are suppressed in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "however , it is simpler to bypass the double limit altogether in the case of the magnitude of the determinant .",
    "one must , of course , make use of the double - limit procedure in computing the phase of the determinant .",
    "fortunately , in two and four dimensions , the phase is finite in the limit @xmath104 , because , as we have seen , there are no odd - parity , bose - symmetric renormalization counterterms .",
    "there is one advantage in using the double - limit procedure to compute the magnitude of the determinant .",
    "the vector - like gauge symmetry of the magnitude of the determinant does not preclude the generation of a mass for the fermion field .",
    "in general , the unrenormalized fermion mass will be nonzero .",
    "however , it is easy to see that fermion self - energy diagrams are suppressed in the double - limit procedure .    in the absence of the double - limit procedure",
    ", one must tune a counterterm ( _ i.e. , _ the hopping parameter @xmath206 ) to make the renormalized mass of the fermion with vector - like couplings vanish . in practical terms , this procedure is somewhat tricky because we wish to maintain the positivity of wilson - dirac determinant , so that its square root is real .",
    "of course , it is well known , from studies of theories with vector - like interactions , how to determine the critical value of the hopping parameter , @xmath207 , at which the renormalized fermion mass vanishes .",
    "there are several procedures at one s disposal .",
    "for example , one can use the vanishing of mass corrections to the ward - takahashi identities , the vanishing of the goldstone - boson ( meson ) mass , or the first occurrence of a zero eigenvalue of the wilson - dirac operator as definitions of @xmath207 .",
    "these approaches are equivalent in the infinite volume limit . in determining @xmath208 by any of these methods , one averages over an ensemble of gauge configurations .",
    "a given gauge configuration may yield a value of @xmath207 that differs from the ensemble average . therefore ,",
    "if one fixes @xmath206 to be slightly below the ensemble - average value of @xmath207 , one may encounter `` exceptional '' gauge - field configurations , such that the lowest eigenvalue of the dirac operator is negative and the fermion determinant is negative . on the other hand",
    ", we expect an average of the determinant over an ensemble of gauge configurations to be positive in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of configurations . to the extent that the thermodynamic limit is equivalent to the infinite - volume limit",
    ", the number of `` exceptional '' gauge - field configurations should become vanishingly small as the volume is taken to infinity .",
    "we note that it is straightforward to reduce the size of the gauge - variant contributions that arise from the odd - parity parts of fermion loops in the region of integration in which the fermion - loop momentum and gauge - field momenta all have magnitudes much less than @xmath141 .",
    "these contributions are a consequence of order @xmath103 deviations of the tree - level lattice fermion action from the tree - level continuum fermion action .",
    "such deviations are easily removed by employing an improved tree - level action @xcite . to reduce the size of the gauge variations that arise from the low - momentum region ,",
    "it is necessary only to improve the wilson term in the tree - level action .",
    "similarly , one can eliminate the leading gauge - variant contributions that arise from the odd - parity parts of loops in the region of integration in which the gauge - field momenta entering a loop are large , but the fermion - loop momentum itself is small . as we have seen , these contributions arise from subdiagrams in which the factors along the fermion line are the same as in a one - loop fermion self - energy diagram . in particular , the leading contribution comes from the terms corresponding to a fermion - mass renormalization .",
    "mass generation is precluded if the action is invariant under a constant shift of the fermion field @xcite .",
    "if we drop the gauging of the wilson term ( [ wilson - gauge ] ) , then the action exhibits this symmetry .",
    "matrix and a factor @xmath72 .",
    "consider a fermion - self - energy diagram . a wilson mass from a rationalized propagator numerator vanishes when sandwiched between two naive vertices , because of the projectors @xmath72 .",
    "the remaining terms in the propagator numerators yield contributions with an odd number of @xmath15  matrices , and so they do nt have the form of a mass term . ] in the case of the odd - parity parts of loops , all of the arguments in both this section on dynamical gauge fields and in section  [ sec : background - gauge ] on background gauge fields are independent of whether the gauging of the wilson term ( [ wilson - gauge ] ) is retained or not . hence , we are free to drop the gauging of the wilson term in computing the phase of the determinant .",
    "( in computing the magnitude of the determinant , one must retain the gauging of the wilson term in order to maintain the vector - like gauge symmetry . )    unfortunately , the two improvement schemes that we have mentioned are of no use unless one can also reduce the size of the violations of gauge invariance that arise from the regions of integration in which both gauge - field momenta and fermion - loop momenta are of order @xmath141 .",
    "this probably would require the use of smoother interpolations , which , as we have already argued , ultimately require nonlocality and lead to increased errors of order @xmath102 .",
    "although the violations of gauge invariance vanish as powers of @xmath103 , a sufficiently large gauge transformation could make the coefficient of the gauge variation impractically large for numerical work .",
    "therefore , it is probably advantageous to fix the interpolating field to a smooth gauge , such as one of the renormalizable gauges",
    ". then one would at least avoid the spurious , large , `` pure gauge '' contributions to the gauge field that are known to arise from uv divergences .",
    "since a chiral - fermion action ( for example , the sum of ( [ naive - action ] ) , ( [ naive - gauge ] ) , ( [ wilson - action ] ) , and ( [ wilson - gauge ] ) ) is not invariant under gauge transformations , if one computes matrix elements of operators involving fermion fields straightforwardly using such an action , the result is not , in general , gauge invariant . in this section ,",
    "we discuss a method for computing matrix elements of fermion operators that yields a gauge - invariant result .",
    "the method that we present is related , but not identical , to the approach that we used in computing the fermion determinant .    in analyzing the matrix elements of fermion operators , we assume that any fermions in the initial and final states have been removed by the lsz reduction .",
    "we also assume that the total number of @xmath209 s is equal to the total number of @xmath210 s , so that the fermion operators can be wick contracted to form interacting propagators .",
    "we begin by employing the @xmath71  trick of section  [ sec : even ] to move all the factors @xmath72 to the end points of the interacting fermion propagators , treating @xmath71 as if it anticommuted with all wilson masses and vertices .",
    "if each interacting propagator s end points are separated by a fixed amount in configuration space , then there is no fermion - loop uv divergence associated with the propagator . in this case",
    ", the rearrangement changes the expression by terms of order @xmath103 and by terms corresponding to the renormalization counterterms associated with radiative corrections to the propagators and operator vertices .",
    "if the interacting propagator s endpoints are separated by a distance that vanishes as @xmath3 , then there is a fermion - loop uv divergence associated with the propagator . in this case",
    ", the rearrangement also changes the expression by terms corresponding to the renormalization counterterms associated with the fermion loop .",
    "once we have completed this rearrangement , all of the factors @xmath72 are associated with the fermion operators . of course ,",
    "@xmath75 , and so there is at most one such factor associated with the left side and one such factor associated with the right side of each operator .    if the operators themselves are independent of the gauge field , then the modified matrix element is exactly gauge invariant , since the fermion now has only vector - like interactions with the gauge field along its propagators .",
    "therefore , in this case , we can compute the modified matrix element without recourse to the double - limit procedure .    if an operator involves gauge fields , for example",
    ", through a gauge - covariant derivative , then , with the modification that we have described , the even - parity part of the expression associated with that operator is still exactly gauge invariant , but the odd - parity part is not .",
    "therefore , we can compute the even - parity part without making use of the double - limit procedure . for the - odd parity part",
    ", we must invoke the double - limit procedure to ensure gauge invariance .",
    "if an interacting propagator s endpoints are separated by a distance that vanishes as @xmath3 , then nonvanishing gauge variations can arise from the associated fermion - loop divergence . in this case , as was discussed in section  [ sec : odd ] , we must also impose the anomaly - cancellation condition ( [ anom - cancel ] ) in order to ensure gauge invariance .",
    "trick here to the odd - parity part as well as to the even - parity part , the anomaly takes on a somewhat different form than in appendix  [ app : anomaly ] .",
    "however , the conclusion  that the gauge variations in the presence of a background field can be removed by imposing the anomaly cancellation condition ( [ anom - cancel])is unchanged . ]",
    "the power - counting arguments that we have given previously also apply to the operator matrix elements .",
    "in particular , we expect the violations of gauge invariance arising from odd - parity operator loops to vanish as @xmath200 , and we expect the deviations of the odd - parity loops from a gauge - invariant expression to vanish as @xmath201 .      as an example of the procedure for computing matrix elements of operators involving fermion fields ,",

    "the result is that @xmath217 is replaced by @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the interacting propagator for baryons with vector - like couplings to the gauge field .",
    "the expression ( [ j - gauge - inv ] ) has an exact ( vector - like ) gauge invariance .",

    "thus , we have recovered the familiar result that , once one has added such renormalization counterterms as are required to render its matrix elements gauge invariant , the baryon - number current is not conserved @xcite .    of course , one could also compute the violation of baryon - number conservation directly , by examining amplitudes that have unequal numbers of incoming and outgoing baryons .",
    "such amplitudes can be computed in the standard way by considering the contributions to the path integral of the zero modes of the dirac operator @xcite . as we have argued in section  [ sec : even ] ( see , in particular , ( [ low - energy ] ) ) , the manipulations of the fermion determinant that we advocate do not affect the low - energy modes in the continuum limit .",
    "therefore , the lattice and continuum calculations yield the same result .",
    "the analyses that we have presented so far have been given in terms of weak - coupling perturbation theory . in this section , we will argue that , in the presence of an arbitrary background gauge field , the perturbation expansions for the fermion determinant and interacting fermion propagators actually determine these quantities completely , except at the zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "this is not to imply that one can analyze the complete theory through the use of perturbative techniques .",
    "the gauge - field sector of the theory , of course , exhibits effects that are not amenable to a perturbative analysis .    throughout this section",
    ", we will assume that the gauge - field configuration defined on the gauge - field lattice ( and implicitly on the fermion lattice ) is bounded .",
    "of course , there is no universal bound that applies to all of the gauge - field configurations in the path integral .",
    "therefore our conclusions may not hold when one sums over all configurations .",
    "another potential loophole arises from the fact that , configuration by configuration , the gauge fields on the fermion - field lattice may become unbounded because of singularities in the interpolating field of the type discussed by shamir @xcite .      in the arguments to follow , the convergence properties of the perturbation series",
    "are crucial .",
    "ultimately , we wish to study these properties in the case of infinite volume and in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "however , it is illuminating to consider first the behavior of the perturbation series for the somewhat simpler case of finite volume and fixed lattice spacing .",

    "the perturbation expansion for the effective action @xmath227 is obtained by expanding the logarithm in ( [ det ] ) in powers of @xmath11 .    as an intermediate step in analyzing the perturbation series ,",
    "let us examine the series in @xmath228 , introducing a parameter @xmath229 as the coefficient of @xmath228 in ( [ det ] ) .",
    "at fixed lattice spacing in a finite volume , @xmath78 and @xmath226 are just finite matrices .",
    "therefore , the logarithm can be considered to be a matrix - valued function with matrix argument .",
    "furthermore , its expansion in powers of @xmath230 has a finite radius of convergence .",
    "let @xmath231 be an eigenvalue of @xmath228 .",
    "then the radius of convergence of the logarithm as a matrix - valued function of @xmath229 is @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is the @xmath231 with the largest magnitude .",
    "there is a branch - point singularity in the matrix - valued function whenever @xmath234 .",
    "now , @xmath235 is an analytic function of @xmath11 through the link variables @xmath236 .",
    "since @xmath235 vanishes as at least one power of @xmath11 as @xmath237 , the perturbation series has a finite radius of convergence in @xmath11 .",
    "the branch points at @xmath234 correspond to isolated branch points in the complex @xmath11  plane .",
    "consequently , one can determine @xmath238 almost everywhere in the complex @xmath11 plane by analytic continuation in @xmath11 . of course , there are ambiguities because of the cuts that arise from the branch points .",
    "however , the ambiguity associated with a cut has no effect on the determinant , since it leads to shifts of the argument of the exponential by @xmath239 , where @xmath61 is an integer .. this implies that we are to the right of the cut in @xmath240 , and so there is no ambiguity in the square root . ]",
    "the branch points themselves correspond to zero modes of the dirac operator . as we have argued in section  [ sec : even ] , the procedure that we use to rearrange the determinant leaves the zero modes unaffected ; they are given , in the limit @xmath104 , by the zero modes of the continuum dirac operator .",

    "the perturbation series determines the interacting propagator everywhere except at the zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "now let us take up the infinite - volume case .",
    "here it is most convenient to examine the convergence properties of the perturbation series , using the momentum - space feynman rules .",
    "we are ultimately interested in the limit @xmath104 .    in order to demonstrate that our perturbative analyses hold for arbitrary @xmath11",
    ", we need to prove two properties : that the perturbation series for the effective action ( logarithm of the fermion determinant ) and the interacting fermion propagator have finite radii of convergence , and that one can take the limit @xmath244 term by term in the perturbation series . to prove the first property , we need to show only that the perturbation series is absolutely convergent . to prove the second property",
    ", we must show that the perturbation series is uniformly convergent as @xmath104 .",
    "we will demonstrate this by showing that the series can be majorized .",
    "that is , we will show that for every @xmath103 in a neighborhood of @xmath245 , the absolute value of each term in the perturbation series is bounded by an @xmath103-independent series that converges .",
    "thus , the proof of the uniform convergence of the series also demonstrates the absolute convergence of the series .",
    "we will assume that the first few terms in the perturbation series of order @xmath246 or less have been removed , so that we do not have to deal with individual terms in the determinant that are divergent as @xmath104 .",
    "obviously , subtracting a finite number of terms does not affect the convergence of the series .",
    "first we analyze the region of integration in which all the gauge - field momenta , and the fermion - loop momentum in the case of the effective action , have magnitudes much less than @xmath141 .",

    "thus , each such contribution to the interacting fermion propagator is bounded by @xmath252 , and each such contribution to the effective action is bounded by @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is an @xmath103-independent constant , @xmath255 is the maximum magnitude of the gauge field , and @xmath53 is the minimum of the magnitudes of the gauge - field momenta . here",
    ", we assume that the momentum of the gauge field is cut off in the infrared by physical effects or by application of an explicit infrared regulator .",

    "suppose that we include the possibility of multi - gauge - field - fermion vertices .",
    "the effect of these is to replace propagator factors by powers of @xmath103 .",

    "therefore , the conclusions that we have reached through a perturbative analysis of the fermion determinant and interacting propagator apply for arbitrary @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , we can conclude that , in the continuum limit , the prescriptions we have given for computing the fermion determinant and the matrix elements of fermion operators give the correct low - energy amplitudes and yield gauge - invariant expressions .",
    "we have presented a general procedure for constructing gauge - invariant lattice formulations of theories of chiral fermions interacting with gauge fields .",
    "the procedure involves three key ingredients : ( 1 )  the fermions must be in an anomaly - free representation of the gauge group ; ( 2 )  one must replace the magnitude of the fermion determinant with the square root of the determinant for a fermion that has vector - like couplings to the gauge field , but that is otherwise identical to the original fermion ; ( 3 )  one must implement the gauge - field action on a lattice with spacing @xmath102 and the interacting fermion - field action on a lattice with spacing @xmath103 , define a suitable interpolation of the gauge field to the fermion - field lattice , and take the limit @xmath267 before taking the limit @xmath105 . ) , ( [ naive - gauge ] ) , ( [ wilson - action ] ) , and ( [ wilson - gauge ] ) .",
    "the corresponding action for a fermion with vector - like couplings is obtained by setting @xmath57 . ] in four dimensions , all three of these conditions are required to ensure the gauge invariance of the formulation . in this procedure , the magnitude of the determinant is exactly gauge invariant .",
    "the gauge variations of the phase of the determinant vanish as @xmath200 , and the deviations of the phase of the determinant from a gauge - invariant expression vanish as @xmath201 , possibly times logarithms of @xmath103 .",
    "( we note that the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for the power behavior of the gauge variations seems to differ from the one derived in this paper . )",
    "we have also presented a closely related method for defining , in a gauge - invariant fashion , matrix elements of fermion operators in chiral theories . as was shown in section",
    "[ sec : baryon - number ] , the application of this method to the baryon - number current leads to the familiar conclusion that that current is not conserved .",
    "the analysis of these methods is couched in weak - coupling perturbation theory . in analyzing the properties of a uv regulator ,",
    "of which the lattice is an example , we are concerned with the behavior of the theory near the cutoff .",
    "hence , one might hope , in the case of asymptotically free theories , that the perturbation expansion would be a reliable guide to that behavior .    furthermore , as we have argued in section  [ sec : nonpert ] , in the presence of a given gauge - field configuration , the perturbation series defines the interacting fermion propagator and the fermion determinant everywhere except at zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "the convergence of the series is uniform in @xmath103 , so that one can analyze the continuum limit term by term .",
    "hence , the methods for computing the determinant and propagator are valid in the presence of a nonperturbative gauge - field configuration .",
    "we have not addressed the issue of the summation over gauge - field configurations outside of the perturbative analysis .",
    "shamir @xcite has presented an argument that potentially undermines these analyses .",
    "he observes that , if an interpolation of the gauge field is gauge covariant , then the interpolating field is related to a smooth field by a gauge transformation that is , in general , topologically nontrivial .",
    "hence , the interpolating field may possess singularities .",
    "such singular fields violate the smoothness requirement for gauge fields on the fermion - field lattice that was used in the power - counting analyses of section  [ sec : counting - a - f ] and also violate the assumption of the boundedness of the gauge fields that was made in section  [ sec : nonpert ] .",
    "it is possible that one might avoid these difficulties by fixing to a suitable gauge on the gauge - field lattice .",
    "however , this is an open question .",
    "putting aside questions of principle , it is not yet clear that the procedure presented will be tractable in practical numerical calculations . the obvious stumbling block is the double - limit procedure for @xmath103 and @xmath102 , which could lead to computing requirements that are much greater than in the case of a single lattice - spacing limit .    in computing the _ magnitude _ of the fermion determinant ,",
    "one has two distinct options .",
    "one can apply the double - limit procedure . then one must tune a counterterm that renormalizes the gauge - field wave function in order to keep the magnitude of the determinant finite in the limit @xmath104 and to obtain the correct renormalization of the gauge - field - fermion coupling .",
    "the coefficient of this counterterm is readily computed in perturbation theory , since it is generated only by the diagram with a single fermion loop and two external gauge fields .    on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude of the fermion determinant is exactly gauge invariant , once one has replaced it with the square root of the determinant for a fermion with vector - like interactions .",
    "therefore , one can compute the magnitude of the determinant by taking @xmath268 . since a vector - like gauge symmetry does not preclude the generation of a fermion mass",
    ", one must also tune a mass counterterm ( hopping parameter ) , so as to keep the fermion massless .",
    "( in practice , it may be a challenging problem to approach the critical value of the hopping parameter in such a way that the positivity of the determinant is maintained .",
    "see the discussion in section  [ sec : imp - opt ] . ) in this single - limit procedure , all other renormalization counterterms can be absorbed into a redefinition of the coupling constant .",
    "hence , only the fermion mass and the coupling constant need be tuned in taking the continuum limit .",
    "it seems possible that one would need to compute only the magnitude of the fermion determinant in updating gauge - field links , computing the phase of the determinant as an expectation value once equilibrated lattices had been generated . if this turns out to be the case , then the use of a single - limit procedure for the magnitude of the determinant would result in an even greater relative reduction of the computing time .    in computing the phase of the fermion determinant one _",
    "must _ employ the double - limit procedure .",
    "this computation is mitigated somewhat in two and four dimensions by the fact that , owing to the absence of odd - parity counterterms in an anomaly - free theory , the phase is actually finite in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , one can carry out a straightforward extrapolation to obtain the limit .",
    "one source of error in the extrapolation is easily reduced . as we have seen in section  [ sec : dynamical ] ,",
    "order-@xmath201 deviations of the phase of the determinant from a gauge - invariant expression arise from the region of integration in which the gauge - field momenta and the fermion - loop momentum associated with a given fermion loop are much smaller in magnitude than @xmath141 . in this region ,",
    "the deviations from the limiting result come from the deviations of the tree - level lattice action from the tree - level continuum action .",
    "the order in @xmath103 of these deviations can readily be increased through the use of improved actions @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can eliminate the order-@xmath201 gauge - variant contributions to the phase of the determinant that arise from the region of integration in which gauge - field momenta are large and the associated fermion - loop momentum is small .",
    "one can accomplish this by dropping the gauging of the wilson term ( [ wilson - gauge ] ) in computing the phase of the fermion determinant ( but not the magnitude ) .",
    "then there is a symmetry under constant shifts of the fermion field @xcite that precludes the generation of fermion - mass terms , which give the largest gauge - variant contributions .    unfortunately , such improvement programs are of limited utility , since errors also arise from the region of integration in both gauge - field momenta and fermion - loop momenta are of order @xmath141 . as we showed in section",
    "[ sec : counting - a - f ] , when one uses an interpolation in which the gauge field is discontinuous along least one direction at the boundaries of the gauge - field lattice hypercubes , these errors are of order @xmath201 .",
    "the use of a smoother interpolation , in which the gauge fields ( or higher derivatives ) are continuous , would , in general , suppress these errors by additional factors of @xmath103 .",
    "however , such interpolations are necessarily less local . in general , the order @xmath102 errors increase as one increases the distance on the gauge - field lattice between the sites that enter in the interpolation .",
    "although gauge - variant contributions ultimately vanish as @xmath104 , the presence of large , `` pure gauge '' contributions in gauge - field configurations might make the approach to that limit problematic in numerical work .",
    "it is probably sensible , therefore , to fix the interpolating field to a smooth gauge , such as one of the renormalizable gauges , to ensure at least that the known , spurious , `` pure gauge '' contributions are absent .    in testing the ideas of this paper in numerical simulations , it would be most efficient , computationally , to consider two - dimensional theories",
    ". then , anomaly cancellation can be achieved by introducing both left- and right - handed fermions , such that the sum of @xmath91 for the left - handed fermions is equal to the sum of @xmath91 for the right - handed fermions @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , two - dimensional theories do not require the double - limit procedure .",
    "that is because , as can be seen from ( [ deg - div - dyn ] ) , the only divergent subdiagram is a fermion loop with exactly two external gauge fields ; there are no divergent subdiagrams containing gauge - field propagators .",
    "however , the odd - parity part of a fermion loop with two external gauge fields is zero by virtue of the anomaly - cancellation condition ( [ anom - cancel ] ) .",
    "therefore , the violations of gauge invariance that arise from the odd - parity parts of fermion loops vanish in limit @xmath269 .",
    "nevertheless , one could use the two dimensional theories as a testing ground for methods of extrapolating to the limit @xmath104 with @xmath102 fixed .",
    "one could check the gauge invariance of the fermion determinant and also compare the results for various physical quantities , such as the mass spectrum , with analytic results .",
    "more stringent tests of the methods presented here could be obtained in four dimensions .",
    "again , one could test the convergence of the extrapolation to @xmath245 and the gauge invariance of the determinant .",
    "also , in weak coupling , one could compare results for physical quantities in the standard electroweak model with calculations in weak - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "it is clear that the fermion determinant we have described corresponds to a complex effective action .",
    "this is a general property of chiral gauge theories that would be expected to hold regardless of the lattice formulation chosen : the effective action receives imaginary contributions that are _ independent _ of the uv regularization from finite odd - parity parts of fermion loops .",

    "we expand the propagators and vertices in a taylor series in the external momenta times the lattice spacing @xmath2 .",

    "we also note that the @xmath15  matrices associated with the loop momentum can never contribute the required linearly independent factors : if a term contains an odd number of @xmath15-matrix factors associated with the loop momentum , it gives a vanishing contribution because the integrand is an odd function of the loop momentum ; if a term contains an even number of @xmath15-matrix factors associated with the external momentum , these factors can be brought together by using the anti - commutation relations and eliminated by using @xmath275 .",

    "for the inverse propagator terms , one does not find the simple pairwise cancellation that occurs in the continuum theory because the lattice vertices are momentum dependent .",

    "we can evaluate it by considering the gauge variation of the continuum action in the presence of a uv regulator .",
    "if we impose a pauli - villars regulator , then we obtain expressions that are identical to those in ( [ anomaly2 ] ) and ( [ anomaly3 ] ) , except that there are no color factors , the wilson mass @xmath39 is replaced everywhere by the pauli - villars mass , the limit @xmath3 is taken in the remaining terms in the propagators and vertices , and there is a minus sign because one subtracts the massive pauli - villars - regulator contribution .",
    "the results are        this result is actually independent of the choice of uv regulator .",
    "as we have already mentioned , if one assumes symmetry under cyclic permutations of the gauge fields , then there are no renormalization counterterms for the odd - parity parts of the ordinary fermion - loop amplitudes ( those associated with diagrams that do not contain @xmath49  vertices ) .",
    "the absence of counterterms guarantees that the amplitudes themselves are regulator independent .",
    "furthermore , the anomaly can be obtained from the amplitudes by varying the gauge fields according to ( [ u - gauge - tx ] ) and absorbing the transformation of the fermion fields ( [ psi - gauge - tx ] ) into a change of variables in the path integral , as was discussed explicitly for the abelian case in reference to ( [ div - eq - gauge ] ) .",
    "therefore , the anomaly is also regulator independent .",
    "in particular , we would have obtained the result ( [ anomaly - int ] ) had we chosen to retain the gauging of the wilson term in the action .",
