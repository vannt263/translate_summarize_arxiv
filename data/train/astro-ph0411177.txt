    "the deficiency of companion brown dwarfs led some researchers to favor gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores as their formation mechanism , similar to that of stars ( bonnell & bastien 1992 ; bate 2000 ) .",

    "this allowed us to measure the accurate position of the central object .",
    "we used a traditional circular lyot stop with its diameter 80  % of the pupil .    for taking images at each band , we adjusted the telescope pointing finely so that the dh  tau primary ( hereafter called dh  tau  a ) was placed at the center of the occulting mask",
    ". three exposures of 10  sec each were coadded into one frame .",
    "after 6 frames of observations , both the telescope and the occulting mask were dithered by @xmath21 .",
    "dh tau a was again placed at the center of the occulting mask , then additional 18 frames were taken .",
    "the total exposure time is 720 sec in each band .",
    "we observed sao 76560 immediately after dh  tau as a reference star of the point spread function ( psf ) under the same configuration .",
    "we also observed fs 111 for photometric calibration .",
    "dark frames and dome flats with incandescent lamps were taken at the end of the night .",
    "the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) was used for data reduction .",
    "a dark frame was subtracted from each object frame , then each object frame was divided by the dome - flat .",
    "hot and bad pixels were removed from the frame .",
    "the peak position of the psf moved slightly on the detector during the observations .",
    "this was caused by the difference in the atmospheric distortion between the infrared wavelength at which the images were taken and the optical wavelength at which the wavefront was sensored .",
    "we measured the peak positions of reference star psf images with the radprofile task and shifted them to have the same peak position . since the subaru telescope is an alt - azimuth telescope and we used an instrument rotator , the position angle of the spider pattern changed with time .",
    "the reference star frames were hence rotated so that the position angle of the spider matched that of each object frame , and then combined .",
    "the combined reference star psf was shifted so that its peak position coincided with the dh  tau  a peak , which had been measured with the radprofile task in each frame .",
    "the reference star psf was then renormalized so that its wing intensity level became the same as that of dh  tau  a at @xmath22 away from its peak .",
    "the halo of dh  tau  a was suppressed in each frame after the reference star psf was subtracted , which allowed us to detect an object ( hereafter called dh  tau  b ) that was located at 234 southeast of dh  tau  a and was @xmath23  mag fainter . finally ,",
    "all the 24 object frames were combined into one image .",
    "the @xmath17-band spectroscopy of dh  tau  b was made on 2003 november 8 with cisco mounted on the subaru telescope .",

    "dh  tau  b was observed at 2 slit positions with a @xmath28 dithering to obtain sky data simultaneously .",
    "two exposures of 300  sec each were made at each slit position .",
    "sao  76860 ( a0v ) was used as a standard star for spectral calibration .",
    "the @xmath29-band spectra were observed in the similar manner on 2004 january 9 with @xmath30 and the total integration time of 60  min .",
    "we used iraf for spectral data reduction again .",
    "each dithered pair of object frames were subtracted from each other and divided by a flat field frame .",
    "we then geometrically transformed the frames to remove the curvature of the slit image caused by the grating .",
    "wavelengths were calibrated using the oh lines in the sky portion of the spectrum with the uncertainty of 10    rms .",
    "individual spectra were extracted from the transformed images using the apall task .",
    "the areas of the spectral images where the intensity of dh  tau  b was more than 20% of its peak intensity at each wavelength were summed into an one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the spectrum was then normalized and combined to produce the final spectrum .",
    "after the hydrogen absorption lines in the standard star spectrum were interpolated and removed , the object spectrum was divided by the standard star spectrum and was multiplied by a blackbody spectrum representing the standard star .",
    "the @xmath29- and @xmath17-band spectra were scaled to the photometric magnitudes .",

    "1997a ; dutrey et al . 1996 ) , any spatial - resolved image of the circumstellar structure has not been presented . even with the coronagraph",
    ", we do not expect any detection of a circumstellar structure with such a short integration time , unless it is highly - flared ( itoh et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "a point source ( dh  tau  b ) was detected at the southeast of dh  tau  a. we consider from the following arguments that dh  tau  b is most likely a physical companion to dh  tau  a. the offset of dh  tau  b with respect to a was ( @xmath31 ) on 2004 january 8 , corresponding to the angular separation and position angle of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 au ) and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "these were @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , on 2002 november 23 ( @xmath37 ) .",

    "( 2002 ) is misprinted .",
    "the detector of ciao was replaced in 2003 nov .",
    "the pixel scale for the new detector is @xmath40 pixel@xmath19 .",
    "] since any other object is not found in the small field of view of ciao , and dh tau b has not been recorded in any published catalog , the offsets of dh tau b are derived only with the positions of dh tau a and b.    dh  tau  b was also detected in the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "1995 for the pixel scale ) .",
    "the three measurements give consistent offsets within 002 , comparable to the pixel size of ciao , in both @xmath38 and @xmath39 directions , suggesting that dh  tau  a and b share a common proper motion in five years . because dh  tau  a has a proper motion of @xmath45  mas / yr and @xmath46  mas / yr ( monet et al . 2003 ; hanson et al .",
    "2003 ; zacharias et al . 2003 ) that could be easily detected against a background or foreground star with ciao in five years of interval , dh  tau  b should not be a background or foreground star .",
    "in fact , dh  tau  b would have moved by ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) in five years if it had been a background star ( see figure [ astrometry ] ) .",
    "dh  tau  b is hence associated with the taurus molecular cloud , where new born stars share a similar proper motion of @xmath49  mas / yr and @xmath50  mas / yr ( jones & herbig 1979 ) .",
    "two physically unrelated stars associated with the taurus molecular cloud have a large chance to have similar proper motions that we can not discern in five years .",
    "there is , however , a very small chance that an object with @xmath51 happens to be located within @xmath52 from dh tau a. we expect 20 such objects in 1 arcdegree square , by extrapolating the luminosity function of low - mass objects associated with the taurus molecular cloud ( itoh et al .",
    "if such objects are randomly distributed , chance probability that an isolated object is located at @xmath52 from dh tau a is estimated as small as @xmath53 .",
    "we therefore conclude that dh  tau  b is most likely a physical companion to dh  tau  a.      photometry of dh  tau  b gives its near - infrared magnitudes of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 at the @xmath16- , @xmath15- and @xmath17-bands , respectively .",
    "its colors , together with those of dh  tau  a , are plotted on the two color diagram in figure  @xmath57 .",
    "both dh  tau  a and b have the colors consistent with t  tauri stars . note that the redder color of dh tau b than dh tau a does not explicitly indicate larger infrared excess of dh tau b than dh tau a. because dh tau b has a lower effective temperature as derived below ( 2700 k ",
    "2800 k ) , than dh tau a ( 3580 k ; hartigan et al . 1994 ) , photospheric color of dh tau b is expected to be redder than that of dh tau a. assuming dh tau a and b have the same photospheric colors as early- and late - m dwarfs , respectively , infrared excesses of both objects are comparable .    the near - infrared spectra of dh  tau  b are shown in figure  @xmath58 , where prominent water absorption bands are seen around 1.4  @xmath59 and 1.9  @xmath59 .",
    "these absorption bands are also prominent in the @xmath15-band spectrum of the giant planet candidate around a young brown dwarf ( chauvin et al .",
    "the absorption lines of k  i and na  i were detected at 1.25  @xmath59 and 2.21  @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "their equivalent widths are measured to be @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the k  i and na  i lines , respectively , using the spectro - photometric bands defined by gorlova et al .",
    "these characteristics suggest a low temperature of dh  tau  b.    we compare the observed spectra with model calculations in figures  @xmath62@xmath63 in order to estimate the spectral type of dh  tau  b , i.e. , the effective temperature ( @xmath64 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "we also employed the extinction of @xmath67  0  4.4  mag in order to accommodate the synthesized spectra to the observed near - infrared spectra and the optical fluxes measured on the _ hst _ archive data .",

    "below 1800  k ( figures  @xmath62@xmath74 ) , the calculated @xmath16-band fluxes are significantly smaller than the observed flux",
    ". the water absorption bands of the models become too deep for @xmath64 between 2000  k and 2600  k ( figure  @xmath75@xmath76 ) , resulting in the excess @xmath15-band fluxes of model spectra .",
    "the @xmath16-band flux of the model again becomes too small at 2900  k.    in order to eliminate the temperature duality , we will use the equivalent width ( ew ) of the k  i 1.25  @xmath25 m line .",
    "although the overall shape of the observed spectra is fitted well in figures  @xmath71 , @xmath77 and @xmath73 , the observed strength of the k  i line is always smaller than those of the model spectra .",
    "we calculated from the data provided by tsuji et al .",

    "the results are presented in figure  @xmath79 , showing that the ew is always larger than the observed value for dwarfs ( @xmath2  5.5 ) for @xmath64 lower than 2900  k. the observed ew is , however , accommodated with the smaller values of @xmath80  4.0  5.0 if @xmath64 is in the range between 2400  k and 2900  k. none of the realistic values of @xmath65 can account for the ew if @xmath64 is less than 2200  k. we should therefore choose the higher @xmath64 solution for dh  tau  b , but its surface gravity should be smaller than that of a dwarf .",
    "the smaller surface gravity does not significantly alter the overall shape of model spectra for the high @xmath64 solution as shown in figure  @xmath81 , while it gives unacceptable change for the low @xmath64 solution as shown in figure  @xmath82 .",

    "the ew of na  i increases with temperature especially when @xmath65 is large .",
    "the observed ew is accommodated with any temperature between 2000  k and 3000  k if @xmath2  3.5  4.5 , while the model calculations predict significantly larger ews if @xmath84  5.0 for @xmath85  2600  k. we therefore conclude that dh  tau  b has @xmath1  2700  2800  k and @xmath80  4.0  4.5 .",
    "the same values are derived when we use the model of allard et al .",

    "near - infrared spectra of low mass young stellar objects have often been compared to those of late type dwarfs ( @xmath2  5.5  6.0 ) .",
    "our observations have shown , however , that overall spectral shapes , dominated by water absorption bands , are not sufficient to determine the spectral type and effective temperature of these objects , but the information of metallic lines is essential when the objects have smaller surface gravity .",
    "gravity effects in young brown dwarfs is firstly analized by lucus et al .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure  @xmath86 , where the observed spectra of dh  tau  b ( @xmath1  2700 ",
