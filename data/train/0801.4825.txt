    "one important characteristic of a microlensing event is that the color of the lensed star does not change during the lensing magnification .",
    "however , events observed in actual lensing surveys can exhibit color shift .",
    "this color shift occurs when the flux from the lensed source star is blended with the flux from other stars located in the seeing disk of the star .",
    "the lensed and blended stars generally have different colors .",
    "then , color shift occurs as the source / blend relative brightness changes during lensing magnification .",
    "@xcite and @xcite pointed out that if the object responsible for a lensing event is a star , it is possible to obtain information about the lens from the measured color shift .",
    "however , this idea could not be implemented for the actual analysis of lens population .",
    "the most important reason for this is that under the previous and current lensing surveys conducted by using ground - based telescopes , the blended flux is mostly attributed to nearby background stars rather than the lens",
    ".    however , the situation will be different in future space - based lensing surveys , such as the _ microlensing planet finder _ ( _ mpf _ ) .",
    "the _ mpf _ is a proposed space mission to nasa s discovery program exclusive for microlensing and it will be equipped with a 1.1 m aperture telescope @xcite . such a survey is ideal for the measurement of the color shift in lensing events due to the following reasons .",
    "first , thanks to the high resolution provided from space observation , the survey does not suffer from blending caused by background stars .",
    "then , one can safely attribute the observed color shift to the lens .",
    "second , the fraction of color - shifted events would be higher in the space - based survey because it will monitor much fainter stars than current surveys . as the monitored star becomes fainter , the relative flux of the lens to the source star increases and",
    "thus the event is more likely to produce large color shift .",
    "third , with high photometric precision , the survey can detect much smaller color shift than ground - based surveys . with the increased fraction of large color - shifted events and higher sensitivity to small color shift combined with",
    "nearly an order higher event rate , the future space - based lensing survey would be able to detect color shifts for a large number of events .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the usefulness of future space - based lensing surveys in measuring color shifts of lensing events . for this",
    ", we estimate the fraction of events with measurable color shifts among the events to be detected from the proposed _ mpf _",
    "we also investigate the properties of the color - shifted events by conducting detailed simulation of galactic lensing events under realistic observational conditions .",
    "the fraction of color - shifted events was previously estimated by @xcite .",
    "however , their work was intended as a template for general comparison with various observational assumptions and thus is not focused on a specific survey .",
    "in addition , they did not provide information about the properties of color - shifted events .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   2 ,",
    "we introduce formalism used for the description of the color shift in general cases and under various limiting cases . in   3 , we describe the simulation conducted to estimate the fraction of color - shift events and their properties . in   4 , we present the resulting distribution of color shift .",
    "we probe the properties of the color - shifted events by investigating the distributions of various quantities related to the events including the source and lens brightness , lens light fraction , magnification , lens mass , and event time scale . in   5 , we summarize and conclude .",
    "the difference between the colors of a lensing event measured during and before lensing magnification is expressed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the observed flux , the subscript ` 0 ' denotes the measured quantity without lensing magnification , and the other subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the observed passbands .",
    "and @xmath7 passbands because the _ mpf _ survey plans to observe in these bands .",
    "see details in   4 . ]",
    "the ratio between the observed fluxes measured in the individual passbands are @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the fluxes from the source star and lens , respectively . with some algebra ,",
    "the color shift is represented as @xmath11 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denotes the ratio between the fluxes from the lens and source , i.e. @xmath13 the sign of the color shift is such that it becomes negative when the apparent source star becomes bluer during lensing magnification and vice versa .    in the limiting case of a very low magnification ( @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the amount of the color shift is approximated as @xmath15 ,   \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "as @xmath14 , @xmath17 , and thus @xmath18 , implying that the color shift expected from a low - magnification event is small .    in the opposite limiting case of a very high - magnification event ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "the numerator on the right side of equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) become @xmath20 , and the color shift is approximated as @xmath21 if the lens is very faint ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , equation  ( [ eq6 ] ) is further simplified as @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{eq7}\\ ] ] considering that the lens / source flux ratio is small , @xmath24 and thus the expected color shift is also small .",
    "this implies that high magnification is not a sufficient condition to produce noticeable color shift . to produce noticeable color shift ,",
    "it is additionally required that the lens should be bright . in the limiting case where the lens dominates over the source star in brightness ( i.e. , @xmath25 )",
    ", the color shift is represented as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the colors of the lens and source , respectively .",
    "this implies that the color shift corresponds to the difference between the colors of the lens and source . under this condition ,",
    "the color shift is maximized .",
    "we estimate the color - shift distribution of events expected from future space - based lensing surveys by conduction bayesian simulation of galactic microlensing events under the observational conditions of the _ mpf _ survey . for this simulation",
    ", it is required to model of the physical parameters including the mass density and velocity distributions of matter along the line of sight toward the field , lens mass function , and luminosity function of source stars and lenses .",
    "we conduct the simulation according to the following procedure .",
    "the survey is assumed to be conducted toward the galactic bulge field and the locations of the source and lens along the line of sight are allocated based on the spatial mass density distribution . following the specification of the _ mpf _ survey",
    ", we set the center of the survey field at @xmath29 .",
    "the spatial mass density distribution is modeled by adopting that of @xcite . in the model ,",
    "the density distribution of bulge matter is based on the deprojected infrared light density profile of @xcite , specifically model g2 with @xmath30 kpc from their table 2 .",
    "the disk density distribution is modeled by a double - exponential disk , i.e. @xmath31 ,   \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 are the galactocentric cylindrical coordinates , @xmath33 kpc is the distance of the sun from the galactic center , @xmath34 is the local mass density , and @xmath35 kpc and @xmath36 pc are the radial and vertical scale heights , respectively .",
    "once the locations of the lens and source star are set , we then assign their velocities based on the velocity distribution model .",
    "the model velocity distribution has a gaussian form .",
    "the mean and dispersion of the bulge velocity distribution are deduced from the tensor virial theorem . the disk velocity distribution is assumed to have a flat rotation speed of @xmath37 and velocity dispersions along and normal to the disk plane of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the resulting distribution of the lens - source transverse velocity from the combinations of the bulge and disk velocities is listed in table 1 of @xcite , specifically the non - rotating barred bulge model .",
    "we assign the source star brightness by using the luminosity function of @xcite .",
    "the holtzman luminosity function is expressed in terms of @xmath40 band .",
    "once the @xmath40-band absolute magnitude of each star is chosen from the luminosity function , we determine the @xmath41 and @xmath7 band magnitude by using the color information listed in @xcite .",
    "the apparent magnitudes are then determined considering the distance to the source star and extinction .",
    "the extinction is determined such that the source star flux decreases exponentially with the increase of the dust column density .",
    "the dust column density is computed on the basis of an exponential dust distribution model with a scale height of @xmath42 , i.e.  @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "we set the normalization of the extinction in the individual passbands such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 for a star located at a distance @xmath46 kpc toward the target field .",
    "the mass of the lens is assigned based on the mass function of @xcite .",
    "the model mass function is composed of not only stars but also brown dwarfs ( bds ) and stellar remnants of white dwarfs ( wds ) , neutron stars ( nss ) , and black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "the model is constructed under the assumption that bulge stars formed initially according to a double power - law distribution of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "these slopes are consistent with @xcite except that the profile is extended below their lower limit of @xmath52 down to a bd cutoff of @xmath53 . based on this initial mass function ,",
    "remnants are modeled by assuming that the stars with initial masses @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 have evolved into wds ( with a mean mass @xmath57 ) , nss ( with @xmath58 ) , and bhs ( with @xmath59 ) , respectively . then , the resulting mass fractions of the individual lens populations are @xmath60 .",
    "once the mass of the lens is set , its brightnesses in @xmath41 and @xmath7 bands are determined by using the mass-@xmath61 relation and the color information presented in @xcite .",
    "we note that bd and remnant lenses are dark and thus events caused by them do not produce color shift .    with all the assigned physical parameters of the lens and source , we then produce lensing events .",
    "we do this under the assumption that the impact parameters of the lens - source encounter are randomly distributed .",
    "since the lens flux does not participate in lensing magnification , it lowers the apparent magnification of the event , i.e. @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the impact parameter of the lens - source encounter normalized by the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "we define detectable events as those with apparent magnifications higher than a threshold value of @xmath64 , that corresponds to the magnification when the source star just enters the einstein ring of the lens , i.e. @xmath65 . the apparent magnification varies depending on the observed passband .",
    "we use the apparent magnification measured in @xmath66 band as the criterion for event detectability because it is the main passband of the _ mpf _ observation ( see below ) .",
    "we assume that there is no blended flux other than the flux from the lens .",
    "we restrict that the survey monitors stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than @xmath3 , which corresponds to early m - type main - sequence stars .",
    "once events are produced , the rate of the individual events are weighted by the factor @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the matter density , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively , the factor @xmath71 is included to account for the increase of the number of source stars with the increase of distance , @xmath72 is the einstein radius which corresponds to the cross - section of the lens - source encounter , and @xmath73 is the lens - source transverse speed . the einstein radius is related to the physical parameters of the lens and source by @xmath74^{1/2}. \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] from the simulation , we find that 66% and 34% of the total events are caused by the lenses located in the bulge and disk , respectively .",
    "we also find that events caused by stellar lenses comprise 48% and others are produced by dark lens components .",
    "the _ mpf _ survey plans to observe in the wavelength range @xmath75  1700 nm in three passbands .",
    "these consist of a very wide passband spanning the full 600  1700 nm range and the other two narrow bands at each end of the range @xcite .",
    "the very wide filter has no equivalence in standard filter , but we assume it corresponds to @xmath66 filter because the central wavelength matches that of the @xmath66 filter .",
    "the two narrow filters are approximated by the @xmath41 and @xmath7 filters .",
    "the observing strategy for _ mpf _ is to do most of the observations with the very wide filter and a small number of observations in the @xmath41 and @xmath7 filters .",
    "we choose color is measured on the images taken in @xmath41 and @xmath7 filters because larger color shift is expected as the wavelength gap between the filters becomes wider .",
    "we assume that _ mpf _ can detect 14.3 and 5.0 photons @xmath76 for a 22 magnitude star in the @xmath41 and @xmath7 bands , respectively @xcite .    for the individual events , we calculate the maximum color shift by using equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the _ mpf _ plans to take images with 100 sec exposure at a 2 min interval and combine the images to make a 10 min exposure image , resulting in a data acquisition rate of @xmath775 images @xmath78 or @xmath79 images @xmath80 .",
    "if 20% of the observations are done in the narrow filters , each of the @xmath41 and @xmath7-band image is obtained every 2.4 hrs .",
    "this rate is frequent enough to cover the peak of nearly all lensing events during which the color shift is maximized .",
    "we assume that color shift is detectable only if the color shift measured at the peak of the event is five times greater than the uncertainty in the color - shift measurement , i.e.  5@xmath1 detection .",
    "we determine the uncertainty of the color shift measurement as follows .",
    "let us define @xmath81 as the ratio between the flux ratios of an event measured in two passbands during and before lensing , i.e. , @xmath82 according to the standard error analysis , the fractional uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath83 is estimated as @xmath84^{1/2 } , \\label{eq15}\\ ] ] where the individual terms on the right side are @xmath85 and @xmath86 under the assumption that the photometry is photon dominated , i.e. @xmath87 , equations  ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) are approximated as @xmath88 and @xmath89 then , from equation  ( [ eq15 ] ) , ( [ eq18 ] ) , and ( [ eq19 ] ) , one finds @xmath90 the uncertainty in units of magnitude is related to the fractional uncertainty @xmath91 by @xmath92 then , the color - shift uncertainty is expressed as @xmath93",
    "in figure  [ fig : one ] , we present the color shift distribution of events expected to be detected from the _ mpf _ survey . from the distribution , we find that color shift can be measured for @xmath2 of the total events . considering that events produced by stellar lenses comprise @xmath94 of the total event",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath95 of all events produced by stellar lenses .",
    "we find that the fractions of color - shifted events among the disk and bulge events are @xmath96 and 9% , respectively .",
    "the fraction for the disk - lens events is higher because the lenses are located closer to the observer and thus they are brighter .",
    "we investigate the properties of the color - shifted events .",
    "first , we examine the brightness of the source stars and lenses . in figure",
    "[ fig : two ] , we present the @xmath7-band brightness distributions of the source+lens combined images ( top panel ) , and separate source stars and lenses ( second and third panels , respectively ) . from the distributions , we find that the color - shifted events have apparent brightness distributed in the range of @xmath97 .",
    "we also find that the source and lens stars of color - shifted events have similar brightness ranges of @xmath98 .",
    "this implies that color shift occurs when the lens brightness is equivalent to that of the source star .",
    "this can also be seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : two ] , where we present the distribution of the @xmath7-band lens light fraction .",
    "we find that @xmath99 of the color - shifted events will be produced by lenses brighter than source stars in the @xmath7 band and @xmath100 of them will have lens light fractions greater than @xmath101 .",
    "second , we investigate the magnifications of the color - shifted events . for this , we construct the distribution of the impact parameters of the lens - source encounter .",
    "the distribution is presented in the top panel of figure  [ fig : three ] . from the distribution , we find , as expected , that color - shifted events tend to have high magnifications .",
    "we estimate that the fraction of the color - shifted events with impact parameters less than @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) is @xmath104 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of the color - shifted events among those with @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) is merely @xmath107 .",
    "these results imply that color shifts will be detected mainly from high - magnification events .",
    "third , we investigate the event time scales .",
    "the event time scale is defined as the time required for the source star to cross the einstein radius of the lens , i.e.  @xmath108 .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig : three ] shows the distribution of the time scale . by comparing the distribution with that of all events , we find that the time scales of the color - shifted events tend to be longer than the events without color shifts .",
    "the most frequent value of the time scale for the color - shifted events is @xmath109 days . on the other hand ,",
    "the mode value of all events is @xmath110 days .",
    "we find this tendency is because the lenses of the color - shifted events tend to be brighter and thus heavier than the lenses of events without color shifts .",
    "we find that the lenses responsible for the color - shifted events have masses located in the range of @xmath111 .",
    "these correspond to stars with spectral types from g down to mid m - type main - sequence stars .",
    "color shift measurement for events produced by late spectral - type lens stars is possible because the _ mpf _ survey will observe in near infrared through which the lens / source flux ratio is not negligible .",
    "the selection effect of color - shift measurements that favors events with higher magnifications and longer time scales implies that the fraction of planetary microlensing events with color - shift measurements would be substantially higher than the average value of all events .",
    "this is because planet detection has a similar selection effect of preferring events with higher magnifications and longer time scales @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be possible to characterize the host stars of planets from color - shift measurements for an important fraction of planetary events .",
    "for some cases , the source and lens stars may have similar colors resulting in small color shifts . in this case",
    ", the lens stars can still be detectable with space - based follow - up observations conducted several years after the event @xcite .",
    "we investigated the usefulness of future space - based lensing surveys in measuring color shifts of microlening events caused by the flux from the lens . by conducting simulation of galactic microlensing events based on the specification of the proposed _",
    "mpf _ survey , we estimated that the shift in the color of @xmath0 would be measured at 5@xmath1 level for @xmath2 of events that would occur on source stars with apparent magnitudes brighter than @xmath3 .",
    "color - shifted events tend to have high magnifications and the lenses would have brightnesses equivalent to those of source stars .",
    "we estimated that @xmath104 of the color - shifted events would have magnifications @xmath112 and the lenses of @xmath99 of the color - shifted events would be brighter than source stars .",
    "the time scales of the color - shifted events would be longer than those without color shifts because these events tend to be brighter and thus heavier than those without color shifts .",
    "we estimated that the most frequent time scale of the color - shifted events would be @xmath109 days , while the mode value of all events would be @xmath110 days .",
    "the spectral type of the lens stars of the color - shifted events would extend down to mid m type because the _ mpf _ survey will observe in near infrared through which the lens / source flux ratio is not negligible .",
    "being able to extract information about the lens from the measured color shift , future space - based lensing surveys would be able to better constrain the lens population of galactic microlensing events ."
