    "the case of two commuting toeplitz operators @xmath5 has been studied by carey and pincus ( @xcite ) and the formulas obtained there involve the tate tame symbol , an expression where the exponents are multiplicities of zeroes of the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 which are holomorphic in the interior of the unit disc .",
    "the general case is expected to involve local indices as defined below .",
    "our principal aim is thus to prove index theorems in the multivariable setup .",
    "this takes the form of a transformation rule for the index under taylor s holomorphic functional calculus . loosely speaking we start out with a commuting tuple of `` variables '' @xmath4 together with a holomorphic `` symbol '' @xmath8 on the taylor spectrum . under the condition that the commuting tuple @xmath9 is fredholm we distinguish between two different index results :    1 .   a global index theorem which expresses the fredholm index of @xmath9 in terms of the locally constant index function @xmath10 associated with the coordinates @xmath4 and local degrees of the symbol @xmath7 near the set of zeroes .",
    "2 .   a local index theorem which expresses the euler characteristic of a localized koszul complex at a common zero @xmath11 for the symbol @xmath7 in terms of the local degree ( or intersection multiplicity ) @xmath12 and the index @xmath13 .    before we provide more details on the above results , we give some information on the multivariable holomorphic calculus .",

    "@xmath4 is called invertible if @xmath18 is contractible and it is called fredholm if the homology of @xmath18 is finite dimensional . when @xmath4 is fredholm , the index is minus the euler characteristic of the koszul complex , @xmath19 in the case where @xmath20 , these definitions coincide with the usual terminology .",
