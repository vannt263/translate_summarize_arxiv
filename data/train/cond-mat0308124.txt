    "since kohn and luttingers@xcite original work on shallow donors in silicon , there has been renewed interest in the study of donor impurities in silicon , particularly the si:@xmath1 system , following kanes@xcite proposal for a solid - state quantum computer . in the kane quantum computer ,",
    "information is encoded onto the nuclear spins of donor phosphorous atoms in doped silicon electronic devices .",
    "application of an electrostatic potential at surface electrodes positioned above the qubits ( @xmath0-gates ) tunes the resonance frequency of individual spins , while surface electrodes between qubits ( @xmath2-gates ) induces electron - mediated coupling between nuclear spins .",
    "perturbing the donor electron density with an externally applied electric field is crucial in tuning the hyperfine interaction between the donor electron and nucleus and hence also in tuning the resonance frequency of the p nuclei and controlling logical operations .",
    "substantial theoretical efforts have been devoted to modeling the p donor electron ground state in the silicon wafer device , and the altered ground state with an externally applied electric field . in this paper",
    "we discuss relevant experimental parameters which can be controlled to perturb the donor electron wave function .",
    "there is a considerable amount of work done in this area , and several theoretical approaches have been pursued with varying degrees of application and approximation . in kohn and luttingers@xcite work , the p donor ground state in the bulk silicon",
    "is calculated using a single trial wave function : a deformed @xmath3 hydrogenic orbital and varying the bohr radii to minimise the ground state energy . in this paper",
    "we follow faulkners@xcite approach and extend kohn s method to include a trial wave function expanded in a basis of deformed hydrogenic orbitals , and vary the bohr radii to minimise the ground state energy . as we have used a large basis set in this approach , the ground state wave function has the flexibility to distort with the application of an electric field above the p donor .",
    "several authors@xcite have previously investigated the effects induced by strain and interface regions on donor states .",
    "these external influences partially lift the valley degeneracy in the bulk silicon .",
    "the effect of an electric field potential at a gate above a p donor in a silicon substrate on the hyperfine interaction coupling between the p donor electron and nucleus has already been reported by several authors . in the work of kane@xcite and larinov _",
    "et al._,@xcite the effect of an electric field potential in the bulk silicon host is considered using perturbative theory , excluding the additional interface potentials .",
    "wellard _ _ et al.__@xcite consider both the influence of the electric field and interface barriers using a spherical effective mass hamiltonian .",
    "the main advantage demonstrated in our approach using the anisotropic basis is the flexibility in choosing the smaller effective bohr radius for the donor ground state to be in the direction towards the interface regions .",
    "this minimizes the overlap of the donor wave function into these regions . for shallow donor depths ,",
    "the donor wave function is restricted in moving towards the @xmath0-gate because of the silicon oxide interface .    in this work ,",
    "we include the effects of both the electric field potential and the interface regions , and the anisotropy of the conduction band minimum in si . to our knowledge",
    ", there have been hitherto no published results for modeling electrostatic gate operations in the kane quantum computer which include simultaneously the anisotropy of the effective masses in the silicon host , the electric field potential and the interface regions in the si wafer device . in this paper",
    "we address all these criteria and discuss relevant experimental parameters which can be adjusted to fine tune the contact hyperfine interaction .",
    "we calculate this coupling as a function of @xmath0-gate voltage , donor depth below associated @xmath0-gate and the back gate depth .",
    "a subsequent paper will discuss our further results for the @xmath2-gate controlled electron exchange interaction between adjacent donor electrons .    in sec .",

    "the solution of poisson s equation to extract the electric field potential for our device with the @xmath0-gate at varying voltages was obtained by simulation using a technology computer aided design ( tcad ) modeling package .",

    "the perturbed donor electron ground state was calculated for each set of experimental parameters to compare and optimise the conditions for addressing the target qubit , @xmath32 .",
    "once the electron ground state was found we calculated the value of the contact hyperfine coupling @xmath50 for each particular voltage at the @xmath0-gate and qubit depth below this gate .",
    "the general formula for the contact hyperfine coupling @xmath50 is given below : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the donor electron ground state wave function evaluated at the donor nucleus , @xmath53 is the bohr magneton , @xmath54 is lande s factor for @xmath55p , @xmath56 is the nuclear magneton and @xmath57 is the permeability of free space.@xcite    since we use effective mass theory , instead of calculating the donor wave function with the full expansion of the bloch functions , we calculate the envelope function , which describes the smooth donor - related modulation of the electron wave - function .",
    "so instead of calculating the contact hyperfine coupling , @xmath50 , directly we calculate the relative shift in @xmath50 with the potential applied and assume this shift will be similar to those of the true wave function.@xcite thus we need to calculate : @xmath58 where @xmath59mhz is determined for @xmath1 in silicon from experimental data,@xcite and @xmath60 are the donor envelope wave functions calculated by our method .",
    "the phosphorous nuclear resonant frequency is affected by the donor electron when the valence electron is spin polarized by a background magnetic field , @xmath61 , of the order of 2 t .",

    "figure  [ fig : fige3 ] shows the nuclear resonant frequency shift of @xmath32 , calculated for a lower range of positive @xmath0-gate voltages , between 0v and 0.8v , for the varying donor depths below the silicon oxide barrier .",

    "these plots are calculated with a close back gate depth set at 60 nm    for comparison of our method with previous results  @xcite reported using a spherical effective mass hamiltonian , we calculated the resonance frequency of @xmath32 using an isotropic effective bohr radius of @xmath65 3 nm . our results were consistent with the calculations of wellard _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the results for the isotropic basis showed that for donor depths close to the silicon oxide barrier , the wave function was restricted in moving towards the applied @xmath0-gate voltage .",
    "the donor wave function obtained using the anisotropic basis , is advantageous because of the smaller effective bohr radius in the direction toward the silicon oxide layer , which results in less penetration of the donor wave function into the interface regions .",
    "thus the anisotropic basis produced a more energetically favorable ground state than the isotropic ground state .",
    "for the lower voltages ( @xmath66v ) , the results are consistent with the expectation that the closer the donor depths are to the applied voltage , the greater the frequency shift . at voltages above a certain threshold and donor depths further away from the silicon oxide barrier",
    ", there is a huge difference in the donor wave function from the zero field ground state , as it is perturbed almost completely away from the nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig : fige7a ] shows an example of this change in electron density for a voltage of 1.0v at the @xmath0-gate and donor depth of 40 nm . here",
    "the p nucleus is at the origin and as @xmath10 decreases the electric field increases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fige7 ] and  [ fig : fige8 ] we observe the difference in the donor electron ground state obtained for a donor depth of 20 and 40 nm with a positive voltage of 1.0v at the @xmath0-gate . in both these plots the donor wave function moves toward the applied @xmath0-gate voltage in the negative @xmath10 direction . for a close donor depth of 20 nm",
    "we observe that even though the donor wave function moves slightly toward the @xmath0-gate , it is significantly restricted in moving in this direction because of the silicon oxide interface in this direction also .",
    "in contrast the donor wave function for a depth of 40 nm deforms unhindered toward the @xmath0-gate , and most of the electron density has been transformed away from the nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig : fige8b ] shows the donor electron density obtained in the @xmath67-plane for a negative voltage of -1.0v at the @xmath0-gate and a donor depth of 20 nm .",
    "a negative applied voltage causes the electron to disperse in all directions away from the positive potential , this plot demonstrates that because of the close back gate in the positive @xmath10-direction , the electron density predominantly perturbs away from the applied voltage in either direction laterally .    because of the interface regions it is either energetically favorable for the donor electron wave function at shallow donor depths to distort completely away from the nucleus , when the gate voltage is negative , or for the donor wave function to be restricted in distorting towards the @xmath0-gate , with a positive voltage .    in table  [ table1 ]",
    "we present a comparison of the difference in the ground state energy for the donor wave function without the electric field ( @xmath68 ) , and with a positive voltage of 1.0v applied to the @xmath0-gate ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "also reported in this table is the tcad potential at the p nucleus for the varying donor depths .",

    "this is because the donor wave function has perturbed only slightly from the zero field ground state wave function .",
    "in contrast the energy difference for the donor depth at 40 nm is much higher as the wave function deforms significantly from the ground state wave function towards the applied voltage .",
    "if we compare the results obtained in our work including the effect of the interface barriers in addition to the electric field potential , with kanes@xcite results wherein only the potential of a uniform electric field in the bulk was considered , we observe that the silicon oxide layer and the back gate exert a significant influence on the donor electron s ground state . instead of the contact hyperfine coupling , @xmath50 , being independent of whether a positive or negative voltage is being applied at the @xmath0-gate as reported by kane , we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : fige4 ] that the interface regions in the silicon host geometry break this symmetry .    even without considering the influence of the interface regions , the effect of",
    "whether a positive or negative voltage is applied at the @xmath0-gate causes very different changes in the donor electron density . for a positive voltage",
    "the electron is bound to both the nucleus and the @xmath0-gate .",
    "in contrast , when a high enough negative voltage is applied so that the electron is no longer bound to the p nucleus , the electric field profile causes the electron to disperse in all directions away from the positive potential .      to observe the effect that the back gate depth has on the donor electron wave function we repeated the calculation with a back gate depth at 100 nm .",
    "figure  [ fig : fige9 ] shows the comparison between nuclear resonant frequency shifts of the donor electron with the application of a voltage at the @xmath0-gate with a close and far back gate .",
    "these calculations were performed with a close back gate at 60 nm and a far back gate at 100 nm , with a bias of 1.0v at the @xmath0-gate and donor depths ranging from 30 to 75 nm .    with a closer back gate the electric field strength was higher within the si wafer , and the donor electron wave function was perturbed greater , and so the frequency shift was more pronounced for donor depths with a close back gate . for donor depths close to the back gate",
    "the interface barrier effectively `` pushes ''",
    "the electron towards the @xmath0-gate . with the back gate at 100 nm ,",
    "the electric field strength is lower , and there is no substantial overlap of the donor electron wave function with the back gate barrier for donor depths of 30 and 40 nm , so it is not as energetically favorable for the donor electron to perturb away from the back gate toward the @xmath0-gate .",
    "figure  [ fig : fige9a ] shows the ground state wave function plotted in the @xmath67-plane for a donor depth of 75 nm and with a back gate depth of 100 nm and a positive voltage of 1.0v at the @xmath0-gate .",
    "this plot demonstrates that even at a donor depth far from the @xmath0-gate , the ground state wave function distorts freely toward the @xmath0-gate because of the close proximity of the back gate , and the remoteness of the silicon oxide interface .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] we present a comparison of the difference in the ground state energy for the donor wave function without the electric field , and with a voltage of 1.0v applied to the @xmath0-gate , and the back gate at 100 nm .",
    "also reported in this table is the tcad potential at the p nucleus for the varying donor depths .",
    "this table reflects the trend noted in table  [ table1 ] that a significantly lower ground state energy is obtained for the deeper donor depths , where the electron density perturbs significantly away from the nucleus toward the applied voltage .",

    "we believe that the results reported here using effective mass theory are quantitatively reasonable .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the variation of the donor wave function with the experimental parameters calculated here using the smooth donor envelope function , would be similar to that of the true wave function .",
    "it is evident that the p donor electron wave function is sensitive to all experimental parameters studied in this paper .",
    "the donor wave function exhibits a fundamental change at crucial experimental parameters , where the electron wave function transforms from being only slightly perturbed from the zero field ground state , to being almost completely perturbed from the nucleus .",
    "these results highlight the significance of the influence of the silicon host geometry on the donor electron wave function .",
    "ongoing work in our laboratory is focusing on verification of these results , using the full bloch wave structure in our calculations .",
    "these results demonstrate the importance of the boundary conditions imposed by the interface regions , and the need to use a basis set which has the flexibility to meet the boundary conditions .    however , including the bloch wave structure , the inter valley terms and the electric field and interface potentials is a challenging task .",
    "the results presented are quantitatively reasonable and provide a fast and reliable method which gives insight into the behavior of the p donor electron wave function under several different experimental conditions . to optimise the fabrication of these devices it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the donor electron wave function on all parameters varied in this paper : donor depth below the @xmath0-gate , back gate depth and voltage at the @xmath0-gate .",
