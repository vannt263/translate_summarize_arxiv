    "the problem of controlling quantum systems has been a renewed subject of study .",
    "quantum computing is basesed on the existence of a set of universal quantum gates which , concatenated , allow one to implement any unitary transformation within a fixed level of accuracy .",
    "these quantum gates are implemented through the controlled manipulation of the interactions among different physical systems .",
    "quantum communication protocols , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , entanglement swapping @xcite and dense coding , also require the precise application of some unitary transformations in a finite set of transformations . a related problem has also been addressed in the contex of quantum control @xcite . there , the goal is to drive the evolution of an initial , possibly mixed , state to a state having a predetermined expectation value of some observable .",
    "this evolution is also considered to be unitary .    in this article",
    "we study the control of quantum systems in the case where it is not possible to resort to unitary transformations .",
    "our main goal is to map a _ known _ quantum state onto another known state via a sequence of measurements with the highest possible success probability , that is , a controlled evolution via measurements only .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the mapping of an _ unknown _ quantum state onto a known pure state can be optimally implemented with the help of two observables only . in this case ,",
    "the highest success probability is achieved when the eigenstates of the two observables define mutually unbiased bases .",
    "it has also been shown that , when the system subjected to the measurements is affected by a decoherence mechanism , only one observable is required @xcite .    here",
    "we study the case of driving by von neumann processes @xcite a known initial state makeing use of more than two observables .",
    "first we analyze the problem of two observables .",
    "thereafter , we show that a new observable can be added in order to achieve a further increase in the success probability . by means of numerical simulations",
    "we show that the success probability rapidly approaches the unity when the number of observables increases .",
    "let us start by supposing that a quantum system is in a _ known _ @xmath2 state . our goal is to drive the system to",

    "@xmath3 target state by measurements only .",
    "if we measure the @xmath4 observable , whose eigenstates are @xmath5 , the probability of projecting to the @xmath3 target state is @xmath6 .",
    "natural questions arise : is it possible to increase this direct probability @xmath7 by making use of an intermediate measurement of another observable @xmath8 ? and , if it is possible , then how is the relation among @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath8 which maximizes such probability ?",
    "so , in order to approach the state of the system to the @xmath3 target state @xcite , we first measure an observable @xmath8 which has the @xmath9 eigenstates . as a second step",
    "we perform a measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the probability of reaching the @xmath3 target through one eigenstate of @xmath8 followed by a measurement of @xmath4 is given by @xmath10 making use of the normalization of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and of the orthonomalization of @xmath11 and @xmath12 the previous expression can be cast in the form @xmath13.\\label{p1s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term at the r.h.s .",

    "for instance , let us consider a source of monochromatic and vertically linear polarized photons @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain photons in a horizontally linear polarized state it is required to put a linear polarizer in their path . implementing two linear polarizers in a suitable configuration , the outcome flux with horizontal linear polarization is decreased fifty per cent with respect to the incoming flux . by implementing more than two linear polarizers , as is suggested above , the output flux of the beam can be increased meaningfully and it can be approached to the initial flux , depending on the number of linear polarizers arranged suitably . since in this scheme",
    "only one component of the each linear polarized flux contributes to the success probability , it will converge a little more slowly than our protocol , however it will also go to @xmath1 as the number of linear polarizers arranged suitably increases , preserving approximately the initial flux .",
    "a nonlinear crystal can change the polarization of a photon while preserving the flux ; however , it also preserves the initial mix degree . in our scheme , independently of the initial mix degree , the output is pure .",
