    "@xmath5 meson decays have been a rich source of useful information on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mechanism in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is now an active field to take advantage of recent and future data from @xmath5-factories to accurately fix the shape of the unitarity triangle of the ckm matrix . in particular , we have been able to determine in recent years one of the angles , @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) , to a high accuracy using mainly @xmath8 decays @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to find reliable methods for determining the other angles as well .",
    "several methods have been proposed to determine the angle @xmath0 ( or @xmath9 ) using hadronic @xmath5 decays , such as the @xmath10 modes @xcite , the @xmath4 modes @xcite , the @xmath11 modes @xcite , the @xmath12 modes @xcite , and the @xmath13 and @xmath4 modes @xcite , by combining the data of branching ratios and @xmath14 asymmetries .",
    "however , recent data suggest possible new physics contributions to the @xmath4 decays and therefore cast some doubt on the relibility of @xmath0 thus obtained @xcite .    with accumulating data",
    "it is now possible to consider an alternative method , which employs the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "these @xmath15 decay modes are closely related to their @xmath16 counterparts , the @xmath4 modes , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote respectively pseudoscalar and vector mesons , because of their similar flavor structures .",
    "however , they do differ in that the final state mesons in the @xmath15 decays contain different polarization components , whereas the @xmath16 decays do not .",
    "moreover , the @xmath15 decay amplitudes can be divided into two types : those in which the spectator quark goes to the pseudoscalar meson in the final state and those in which the spectator quark goes to the vector meson .",
    "consequently , the @xmath15 decays involve two disjoint sets of contributing topological amplitudes .",
    "one connection between these sets of amplitudes is by lipkin s assumption which states that the penguin amplitude in the @xmath1 modes , @xmath19 , is equal to that in the @xmath2 modes , @xmath20 , in magnitude but opposite in sign based on a parity argument @xcite .",
    "this assumption can be used to readily explain the observed @xmath21 , @xmath22 branching ratios as a result of interference between these two types of penguin amplitudes .",
    "it is also verified in global @xmath23 fits to observed decay data in the framework of flavor su(3 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we provide the necessary formulas and current data for @xmath24 and @xmath2 modes in section [ sec : basics ] .",
    "we first consider the constraints on @xmath0 from individual sets of @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays in sections [ sec : kstarpi ] and [ sec : rhok ] , respectively . in section [ sec : eqset ] we show that information on @xmath0 with less hadronic uncertainty can be obtained by combining the four @xmath1 and @xmath2 observables when lipkin s assumption is used .",
    "we discuss possible improvements in section [ sec : others ] and conclude our findings in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    ".experimental data measured by babar , belle , and cleo collaborations for @xmath24 and @xmath2 modes .",
    "the branching ratios are quoted in units of @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath14 asymmetry of a decay mode , if measured , is quoted in the second line . [",
    "tab : ds1data ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we collect the latest @xmath14-averaged branching ratio and @xmath14 asymmetry data of the relevant decays in table  [ tab : ds1data ] .",

    "[ tab : ds1 ] , we list the topological amplitude decompositions of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays @xcite along with the averaged decay strengths and @xmath14 asymmetries compiled from table  [ tab : ds1data ] .",
    "when computing each invariant decay amplitude from the corresponding branching ratio , we have first used the central values of the @xmath5 meson lifetimes : @xmath26 ps and @xmath27 ps @xcite , and the two - body @xmath5 decay formula [ eq : width ] ( b m_1 m_2 ) = |a(b m_1 m_2)|^2  , where @xmath28 is the magnitude of the 3-momentum of the final state meson in the rest frame of @xmath5 , @xmath29 is the @xmath5 meson mass , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be either pseudoscalar or vector mesons .    in view of the much suppressed exchange , annihilation , and color - suppressed ew penguin amplitudes",
    ", we only keep the tree ( @xmath32 ) , color - suppressed tree ( @xmath33 ) , penguin ( @xmath34 ) , and color - allowed electroweak ( ew ) penguin ( @xmath35 ) amplitudes in the table . in our notation",
    ", the primes refer to the amplitudes of @xmath36 decays while the unprimed ones are reserved for @xmath37 decays .",
    "the subscript @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) associated with the amplitudes denotes that in the process the spectator quark in the @xmath5 meson ends up in the pseudoscalar ( vector ) particle in the final state .",
    "all these processes are dominated by penguin amplitudes .    since the branching ratio of the @xmath38 mode has not been measured , we will take lipkin s assumption @xmath39 to continue the analysis whenever necessary .",
    "however , such an assumption can be relaxed or corrected accordingly once the decay is observed .    in light of their simplicity",
    ", we first consider the following ratios r(k^ * ) & & = | |^2 = 1.40 0.26  , + r(k ) & & = | |^2 > 0.22 + [ eq : rrhokdef ] & & = | |^2 = 1.09 0.24  , where @xmath40 refers to the @xmath14-averaged decay width and `` @xmath41 '' in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rrhokdef ] ) indicates where lipkin s assumption is used .",
    "the numerical values are computed from table  [ tab : ds1 ] .",
    "these ratios can be expressed , as will be seen later , in terms of relative strong and weak phases , along with the parameters @xmath42    since factorization works well in the tree amplitudes , @xmath43 can be related to @xmath32 in the @xmath36 two - pseudoscalar @xmath5 meson decays : r_p & & = 1.43  , + r_v & & = 0.85  , where the numerical results are evaluated using the bswii form factor model @xcite , @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev , and @xmath46 mev @xcite . moreover , assuming flavor su(3 ) symmetry , @xmath32 can be related to @xmath47 extracted from the @xmath48 decays by simple ckm factor and decay constant ratio : = 0.284  , where we have used @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite of the semileptonic @xmath50 decay yields @xmath51 ev . in the current analysis , we take @xmath52 ( the error taken to be 1.96 times the upper error of the previous number ) ev as a conservative estimate to take into account model dependence in the extraction of ref .",
    "@xcite , later scaling , and the part of penguin contributions with the same ckm factor as the tree amplitude ( although this part is not significant for explaining the data , as shown in ref .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath53 ev , @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 is directly extracted from the branching ratio of @xmath57 and @xmath58 is temporarily using the same value . for comparison , @xmath59 and @xmath60 as determined from a global fit to the @xmath15 modes @xcite .",
    "let s concentrate on the @xmath1 decay modes in this section . using the parameter @xmath61",
    ", we have the decay amplitude ( k^*+ ^- ) = - p_p  , + where we fix the phase convention that @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the strong phase of @xmath64 relative to the real axis . it is noted that a small penguin amplitude with the same weak phase as the tree amplitude is absorbed into it .",
    "this then gives @xmath65 eliminating the @xmath63 dependence in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rkstarpi ] ) and ( [ eq : racpkstarpi ] ) gives @xmath66 given fixed values of @xmath61 and @xmath67 , one can obtain a curve that relates @xmath0 to @xmath68 .",
    "it is noted that the above equations are invariant under the transformations @xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , there is a four - fold ambiguity in the extraction of @xmath0 . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the solution only in the first quadrant in view of the @xmath70 range at @xmath71 confidence level extracted from other observables @xcite . since only the absolute value of @xmath67 matters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : contour ] ) , the allowed @xmath0-@xmath68 region shall be bounded in part by the curves corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath73 .     and the weak phase @xmath0 for @xmath74 .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to @xmath75 , and the dash - dotted curve corresponds to @xmath76 .",
    "the dashed lines represent the @xmath77 range of the observed @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig : rkstarpi],width=302 ]    for illustration purposes , we fix @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rkstarpi ] . the solid and dash - dotted curves correspond respectively to @xmath78 and @xmath76 .",
    "an upper bound of @xmath79 is seen in the drawing .",
    "the lower bound is determined by the @xmath80 curve and shown to be trivial according to current data .",
    "the intersection vertex of the these curves at @xmath81 rests at the lower end of or below the @xmath77 range of @xmath68 for all possible @xmath61 within its @xmath77 limits of eq .",
    "( [ eq : r1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , more conservative upper bounds on @xmath0 are obtained for larger values of @xmath61 . however , certain values of @xmath0 in the middle range may be disfavored if the @xmath82 curve exceeds the upper boundary of @xmath68 .",
    "for example , the range @xmath83 is disfavored when @xmath84 .",
    "if one uses @xmath85 as determined later in section [ sec : eqset ] , one obtains an upper bound of @xmath86 on @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath61 is determined to be smaller , the vertex position will drop lower and both of the two intercept points of the @xmath76 curve will move toward unity , resulting in a stronger bound on @xmath0 .",
    "for example , @xmath87 if one takes the lower limit @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r1 ] ) .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for the @xmath89 and @xmath38 modes . as mentioned before",
    ", the branching ratio of the @xmath38 mode is yet to be measured .",
    "one can use lipkin s assumption instead to evaluate the experimental value of the ratio @xmath90 , although this is completely unnecessary if the @xmath38 decay is seen . in this case",
    ", we have the amplitude ( ^- k^+ ) = p_p  , where @xmath91 is the strong phase of @xmath92 relative to @xmath20 , and [ eq : rrhok ] r(^- k^+ ) & = & 1 + 2 r_2 _ v + r_2 ^ 2  , + [ eq : racprhok ] r(^- k^+ ) a_cp(^- k^+ ) & = & 2 r_2 _ v  .",
    "one thus obtains the same type of equation as eq .",

    "[ fig : rrhok],width=302 ]    we draw in fig .  [ fig : rrhok ] the curves corresponding to @xmath93 .",
    "as seen in the drawing , the intersection vertex of the asymmetry curves at @xmath97 falls within the @xmath98 limits of @xmath96 , which is measured to be around unity .",
    "no upper bound on @xmath0 can be obtained in such cases .",
    "since the @xmath14 asymmetry is nonzero at @xmath77 level , a lower bound @xmath99 is given by the @xmath95 curve .",
    "this is complementary to the information one learns from the @xmath1 modes in the previous section , where no lower bound can be obtained due to the observed @xmath14 asymmetry being consistent with zero .",
    "varying @xmath100 does not change this lower bound much , and the most conservative bound on @xmath0 is determined with the largest possible @xmath100 . moreover , decreasing @xmath100 shrinks the @xmath101 curve toward the vertex at @xmath81 .",
    "a better determination of @xmath102 will be able to provide stronger bounds .",
    "for example , if the upper limit of @xmath102 is lowered or @xmath100 turns out to be larger , a middle range of @xmath0 will be excluded . on the other hand , a stronger lower bound on @xmath0",
    "can be deduced from a larger lower limit on @xmath102 or a smaller @xmath100 .",
    "instead of treating @xmath61 and @xmath100 independently , one may relate one to the other by employing the relation @xmath103 : @xmath104 where the same numerical factors are used as before .",
    "this can be compared with the result of @xmath105 obtained from a global fit @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 and @xmath100 are related to each other by a simple numerical factor .",
    "we will take the former as the independent parameter .",
    "there are then four parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 , and @xmath91 ) for the four observables in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rkstarpi ] ) , ( [ eq : racpkstarpi ] ) , ( [ eq : rrhok ] ) , and ( [ eq : racprhok ] ) .",
    "one can readily find a solution @xmath106 , @xmath85 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 from the central values of the observables , where we have again imposed the requirement that @xmath0 has to fall within the favored region ( @xmath70 ) determined by ref .",
    "( the other solutions correspond to the transformations @xmath109 ) without changing @xmath61 . )",
    "it is seen that the value of @xmath0 extracted using this method rests on the lower end of the currently preferred range .",
    "the value of @xmath61 is found to be consistent with our previous estimate .",
    "note that we do not assume any knowledge about the size of @xmath64 or @xmath92 here and avoid the somewhat far - reaching relation between them and the tree amplitude in the @xmath110 decays by employing flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "varying @xmath111 between @xmath112 and @xmath113 does not change the solutions of @xmath63 and @xmath91 much , but @xmath0 and @xmath61 decrease from @xmath114 to @xmath115 and from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "the strong phase @xmath107 means that @xmath64 lies almost in line with @xmath19 .",
    "this can be readily understood as the result of that the central value of @xmath118 is zero and that there is a constructive interference between the two amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties on the current data are still too large ( in contrast to the @xmath4 case ) to obtain a restricted @xmath98 range for the weak phase @xmath0 .",
    "if the data precision can be improved by , for example , a factor of two , a @xmath98 range of @xmath119 can be obtained assuming the same central values as the present ones .",
    "it should be emphasized that the assumption @xmath120 can be relaxed once @xmath121 is measured . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rvp ] ) , what is essencial is the factorization of the tree amplitudes . in that case , @xmath111 should be further scaled by the factor @xmath122 .",
    "note that the information on the relative strong phase between @xmath19 and @xmath20 is not crucial here .",
    "let s now turn to the following quantities derived from a larger set of decay modes : @xmath123 again , `` @xmath41 '' in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcrhok ] ) indictaes the use of lipkin s assumption . in principle , one can also obtain information on @xmath0 from the combination of @xmath124 and @xmath125 and the combination of @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "currently , we are still lacking in data of the @xmath14 asymmetries and two branching ratios .",
    "moreover , they require the determination of the corresponding ratios @xmath128 this is more involved than the case of @xmath4 because although @xmath129 can be deduced from @xmath130 using su(3 ) , the @xmath15 counterparts @xmath131 and @xmath132 contains additional contributions from the penguin amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath20 that interfere with each other constructively .",
    "extra assumptions need to be imposed in order to extract the required information @xcite .",
    "recently , it is pointed out that current experimental data indicate some discrepancy between @xmath133 and @xmath134 that should be equal to each other at the leading - order expansion .",
    "such a discrepancy can be resulted from two possibilities : either the @xmath135 detection efficiency in experiments is systematically underestimated , or it calls for contributions of @xmath3 amplitudes beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath136-@xmath137 comparison in the cases of @xmath1 and @xmath138 decays is somewhat analogous .",
    "however , a direct experimental comparison is not yet available because of insufficient data in the @xmath139 and @xmath38 modes . employing the lipkin relation again for the @xmath38 mode",
    ", the current data show an approximate agreement between eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcrhok ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : rnrhok ] ) .",
    "if the discrepancy between @xmath136 and @xmath137 in the @xmath4 system is due to the underestimated @xmath135 detection efficiency , we expect a similar pattern in the @xmath1 system but not in the @xmath2 modes .",
    "this seems to be partly favored by the rough agreement between eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcrhok ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : rnrhok ] ) , although a mild assumption is used here and the @xmath140 counterparts still await to be seen .",
    "suppose the interpretation of new physics , which is short - distance in nature , is correct for the @xmath4 modes , then one should expect to see its effects in the @xmath15 ( both @xmath1 and @xmath138 ) and @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) modes too .",
    "however , a detailed analysis is required because the latter modes involve different polarizations .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on possible branching ratios of the @xmath143 and @xmath38 decays by noting two approximate sum rules : @xmath144    ~ , \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : sumrule2 }    \\lbar\\gamma(\\rho^+ k^0 ) + \\lbar\\gamma(\\rho^- k^+ )    & \\approx &    2 \\left [ \\lbar\\gamma(\\rho^0 k^+ ) + \\lbar\\gamma(\\rho^0 k^0 ) \\right ]    ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they hold only when the terms @xmath145 $ ] are negeligible in comparison with the dominant penguin contributions .",
    "it is noticed from a global fit to @xmath15 data @xcite that the contributions due to @xmath146 and @xmath147 are quite sizeable , thus raising doubt on the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule1 ] ) while those due to @xmath148 and @xmath149 are less significant . assuming these sum rules , one can deduce from current data that @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the current upper bounds . in particular",
    ", @xmath121 thus obtained and the measured @xmath152 are about the same , which is another indication of the equality @xmath120 . at any rate",
    ", a precise determination of the rates of @xmath139 and @xmath38 decays will be very helpful in checking the @xmath136-@xmath137 relations and the above sum rules .",
    "we have shown that the branching ratios and @xmath14 asymmetries of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes can help us constraining the weak phase @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we emphasize the uses of the @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath38 , and @xmath89 decays . with the choice of @xmath74 and @xmath93 ,",
    "we show that the existing data give us the bounds @xmath155 from the @xmath1 modes and @xmath99 from the @xmath2 modes .",
    "although currently very loose , these bounds are expected to improve with higher data precision in the coming years .    by relating the two types of tree amplitudes , @xmath64 and @xmath92 , in",
    "the @xmath15 decays , one can reduce the number of parameters in the problem and solve for @xmath0 .",
    "this method is free from su(3 ) breaking uncertainties .",
    "it is found that the solution of @xmath0 thus obtained is consistent with those obtained from other observables . however , a better constraint on @xmath0 from these modes is not possible until the data precision is further improved .",
    "the solution also tells us the tree - to - penguin ratio , which we find to agree with that estimated using flavor symmetry .",
    "we also point out that it is interesting to check whether @xmath156 for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays . as shown above",
    ", the equality roughly holds for the @xmath2 modes when lipkin s assumption is used .",
    "if the equality turns out to hold in the case of @xmath2 but to be violated for @xmath1 with a similarly puzzling difference as the @xmath4 decays , then it is likely that the underestimated @xmath135 detection efficiency explanation is favored . on the other hand ,",
    "if the data tell us that both equalities are violated in these @xmath15 modes , then the new physics explanation is more plausible .",
    "however , one then has to work out the new physics contributions to different polarization components .",
    "we therefore stress the importance of measuring the yet unseen modes in order for us to validate the use of the relation @xmath39 and to see any further hints on new physics .",
