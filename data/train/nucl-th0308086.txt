    "the @xmath4 ( roper ) is a broad resonance which couples strongly ( 60@xmath570@xmath6 ) to the @xmath7 channel and significantly ( 5@xmath510@xmath6 ) to the @xmath8 channel @xcite",
    ". it may therefore play an important role in nuclear dynamics as an intermediate state .",
    "graphs involving the excitation of the @xmath4 appear in many different reactions from the @xmath9 to the heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies @xcite    usually the @xmath10 transition potential is taken as a straightforward generalization of some pieces of the @xmath11 interaction , scaling the coupling constants and incorporating resonance width effects .",
    "however this procedure may have serious shortcomings specially concerning the short - range part of the interaction @xcite .",
    "in this talk we present some applications of a recently derived @xmath12 transition potential@xcite , obtained by means of the same quark - model approach previously used to study the @xmath11 system and transition potentials involving the @xmath13 resonance @xcite . a main feature of the quark treatment is its universality in the sense that all the baryon - baryon interactions are treated on an equal footing .",
    "therefore , once the model parameters are fixed from @xmath11 data there are no free parameters for any other case .",
    "a second important aspect is the appearance of quark exchanges between baryons , coming from quark antisymmetry . as quarks",
    "can not be exchanged between two baryons if their wave functions do not overlap , the exchange contributions are necessarily short ranged .",
    "after a brief description of the quark model based @xmath14 interaction ( a complete discussion can be found in @xcite ) , we center our attention in the study of a reaction mediated by the excitation of the roper resonance , the @xmath15 reaction , and on the derivation of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 coupling constants .",
    "in the born - oppenheimer approximation the @xmath10 potential at interbaryon distance @xmath18 is obtained by sandwiching the @xmath19 potential between @xmath11 and @xmath20 states , written in terms of quarks , for all the pairs formed by two quarks belonging to different baryons . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath19 potential contains a confining term taken to be linear ( @xmath21 ) , the usual perturbative one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) interaction containing coulomb ( @xmath22 ) , spin - spin ( @xmath23 and tensor ( @xmath24 ) terms , and pion ( ope ) and sigma ( ose ) exchanges as a consequence of the breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath26(0s)^{2}(1s)\\rangle -\\sqrt{% \\frac{1}{3}}|[3](0s)(0p)^{2}\\rangle \\right\\ } \\otimes \\lbrack 1^{3}]_{c}$ ] and @xmath27(0s)^{3}\\rangle \\otimes \\lbrack 1^{3}]_{c}$ ] , where @xmath28_{c}$ ] is the completely antisymmetric color state , @xmath29 $ ] is the completely symmetric spin - isospin state and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , stand for harmonic oscillator orbitals .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the potentials obtained for @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the interaction is repulsive at short range @xmath36 , attractive at intermediate range @xmath37 , and asymptotically repulsive , this last behavior contrary to the naive expectation .",
    "this sign reversal is a direct consequence of the presence of a node in the  @xmath4 wave function which implies a change of sign with respect to the @xmath25 wave function .",
    "certainly it is possible to choose the opposite sign for the @xmath38 wave function with respect the @xmath25 , and in this case the long - range part of the transition potential would become attractive but there would be also an unexpected change from repulsion to attraction at short - range .",
    "this makes evident that the @xmath10 transition potential looks very different from the @xmath11 interaction and that the simple scaling procedure seems not to be appropriate to derive the interaction with a resonance .",
    "there are two experiments where the @xmath4 resonance contribution has been isolated by means of model - dependent theoretical methods .",
    "the first one is the @xmath9 reaction carried out in saclay @xcite already ten years ago .",
    "the data showed two peaks in the cross section , the most prominent one attributed to a @xmath39 excitation in the projectile ( dep ) @xcite , and the second one explained as a roper excitation in the target ( ret ) @xcite .",
    "the second experiment is the @xmath40 reaction , that was studied making use of the same mechanisms @xcite .",
    "these two reactions are particularly interesting because in both cases the projectile ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) has @xmath43 .",
    "this ensures that the @xmath4 reaction mechanism can only be driven by a scalar interaction .",
    "our purpose in this section is the study the target roper excitation process in the @xmath15 reaction making use of the quark model @xmath12 transition potential .",
    "we will consider the data where the @xmath13 contribution has been subtracted @xcite as our experimental data .",
    "the amplitude for the elementary process of @xmath4 production can be written in terms of the scalar transition potential @xmath44 as @xcite : @xmath45 the function @xmath46 is the deuteron form factor @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the deuteron s - wave function , and the momentum @xmath49 is taken in the initial deuteron rest frame .",
    "@xmath50 is the momentum transfer between the nucleons in the center of mass system and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the @xmath4 propagator as given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to perform the calculation",
    ", we need to extract the genuine scalar potential at all distances from the quark - model based @xmath53 interaction .",
    "such potential presents a non - trivial structure at short distances due to the quark antisymmetrizer , which involves operators of the type @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "when combined with the corresponding spin - isospin operators of each piece of the interaction one obtains a general form @xmath56 , after projecting the quark spin - isospin degrees of freedom into nucleonic spin - isospin degrees of freedom @xcite . from this projection ,",
    "the functions @xmath57 can be easily calculated @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fighire1 ] we present the contribution to the @xmath15 cross section coming from the different interactions at quark level .",
    "the most important ones are those from the scalar pieces generated from the pion and gluon exchange combined with quark exchanges .",
    "this shows that the process is driven by the short - range part of the interaction , where quark exchanges are relevant . in fig .",
    "[ fighire ] we compare the result obtained using the quark - model derived @xmath10 potential to the experimental data . as can be seen , the cross section is understimated , coming closer to data if one chooses a smaller value for the @xmath4 width .",
    "the bigger disagreement with the extracted data corresponds to the region where the error bars are larger , in other words , to the region where the uncertainties related to the theoretical method used to subtract the @xmath39 contribution and interference term are important .",
    "the subtraction of the @xmath39 contribution is proportional to the square of the @xmath58 coupling constant .",
    "its value is different in baryonic processes , @xmath59 , than the one used in our model , @xmath60 @xcite , because it includes tensor coupling between the @xmath61 @xmath11 and the @xmath62 @xmath63 partial waves . as a consequence",
    ", the baryonic calculation of the @xmath39 contribution could be underestimating the region above the peak overestimating in this way the @xmath4 contribution .",
    "the way to wipe out those uncertainties would be to calculate the @xmath39 contribution together with the interference term making use of quark - model potentials .",
    "the usual way to determine meson@xmath66 coupling constants is through the fitting of @xmath11 scattering data with phenomenological meson exchange models .",
    "however @xmath11 @xmath67 scattering data do not exist and one has to resort to another procedure to determine meson@xmath68 coupling constants . taken into account that the quark transition potential obtained can be written at all distances in terms of baryonic degrees of freedom @xcite , one way to obtain the coupling constants is to parametrize the asymptotic central interactions as @xmath69\\,% \\frac{e^{-m_{\\pi } r}}{r}\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath70 by comparing these baryonic potentials with the asymptotic behavior of the ones previously calculated from the quark model , we can extract the @xmath71 and @xmath17 coupling constants in terms of the elementary @xmath72 coupling constant and the one - baryon model dependent structure .    the @xmath73 $ ] vertex factor in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) comes from the vertex form factor chosen at momentum space at the quark level , @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] , where chiral symmetry requires the same form for pion and sigma .",
    "then it is clear that the extraction from any model of the meson - baryon - baryon coupling constants depends on this choice .",
    "we shall say they depend on the coupling scheme .    to get @xmath75 we take our results for the @xmath76 one - pion exchange potential and we fit its asymptotic behavior ( in the range @xmath77 fm ) to eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath78    i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "as explained above only the absolute value of this coupling constant is well defined . in ref .",
    "@xcite a different sign with respect to our coupling constant is obtained what is a direct consequence of the different global sign chosen for the @xmath4 wave function . the coupling scheme dependence can be explicitly eliminated if we compare @xmath80 with @xmath81 extracted from the @xmath82 potential within the same quark model approximation .",
    "thus we get @xmath83 this ratio is similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and a factor 1.5 smaller than the one obtained from the analysis of the partial decay width .",
    "nonetheless one can find in the literature values for @xmath84 ranging between 0.27@xmath50.47 coming from different experimental analyses with uncertainties associated to the fitting of parameters @xcite .    by proceeding in the same way for the ose potential we obtain @xmath85 our result",
    "agrees quite well with the only experimental available result , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , we can give a very definitive prediction of the magnitude and sign of the ratio of the two ratios ,    @xmath87    which is an exportable prediction of our model .",
