    "the process ( i ) dominates and will be discussed here , but the contribution of process ( ii ) can be calculated similarly .    the process fig.[figure](i ) represents an effective @xmath74 matrix element of the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 represents a @xmath1 fermion wavefunction , @xmath77 represents a @xmath2 fermion wavefunction , and @xmath78 represents the amount by which the intermediate state is off shell .",

    ", the scattering in the @xmath1 fermion sector takes us off shell by an amount of order @xmath8 .",
    "finally , since each site has in effect a single associated state @xmath80 , the matrix element is of order @xmath81 , where we have assumed the @xmath2 wavefunctions @xmath76 are localized to a volume of radius @xmath45 , and where @xmath82 is a random phase .",
    "the effective induced interaction may be obtained by summing over all intermediate @xmath1 fermion states i.e. @xmath83 there are @xmath84 terms contributing to the above sum ( since the four @xmath2 fermions involved can interact through @xmath1 fermions anywhere in the volume where they all overlap ) .",

    "the main differences are ( 1 ) the integrals @xmath87 now go over volumes of linear dimension @xmath30 ( 2 ) normalization requires that @xmath88 within @xmath30 of the corresponding localization center ( 3 ) the minimum energy change is @xmath89 and ( 4 ) instead of having @xmath84 terms contributing to the sum ( [ sum ] ) , there are @xmath90 contributing terms ( i.e. the volume can be divided into @xmath91 cells , in each of which there are @xmath92 possible choices of @xmath93 ) . as a result ,",

    "<S> we examine what happens when a strongly many body localized system is coupled to a weak heat bath , with both system and bath containing similar numbers of degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> previous investigations of localized systems coupled to baths operated in regimes where the back action of the system on the bath is negligible , and concluded that the bath generically thermalizes the system . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the system is strongly localized and the bath is only weakly ergodic , the system can instead localize the bath . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this both in the limit of weak coupling between system and bath , and in the limit of strong coupling , and for two different types of ` weak ' bath - baths which are close to an atomic limit , and baths which are close to a non - interacting limit . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of this ` many body localization proximity effect ' indicates that many body localization is more robust than previously appreciated , and can not only survive coupling to a ( weak ) heat bath , but can even destroy the bath .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum localized systems violate many of the foundational assumptions of quantum statistical physics ( such as the ergodic hypothesis ) , and present an exciting new frontier for research @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while localization was long believed to occur mainly in systems of non - interacting particles , the recent discovery of many body localization ( mbl ) @xcite has ignited a blaze of interest in this field . </S>",
    "<S> it has been realized that quantum localized systems can display a cornucopia of exotic properties , including an emergent integrability @xcite , exotic quantum states of matter @xcite , and unexpected behavior in linear @xcite and non - linear @xcite response . </S>",
    "<S> these properties not only dramatically revise our understanding of quantum statistical physics , but also offer a new route to dissipationless quantum technologies . a summary of progress in this field can be found in the review article @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most works on mbl have focused on perfectly isolated quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> experimental systems , however , are always coupled ( however weakly ) to a thermalizing environment . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of many body localized systems coupled to a thermalizing environment was first examined in @xcite , in the limit where back action on the bath was negligible and the bath could be treated as markovian . in this limit , it was argued that an arbitrarily weak coupling to a thermodynamically large bath should restore ergodicity , thermalizing the system . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggested that perfect mbl would be unobservable in experiments , which would see instead only signatures of proximity to a localized phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , these works left open the question of whether different physics could result if the localization in the system were strong , and the bath were weak . </S>",
    "<S> could many body localization then survive even after coupling to a heat bath ?    in this letter , we show that when the system of interest is strongly localized , and the ` heat bath ' is only weakly ergodic , then mbl in the system can not only survive coupling to the bath , but can even localize the heat bath . </S>",
    "<S> we call this phenomenon a ` many body localization proximity effect , ' and it establishes that mbl is much more robust to coupling to an environment than was previously appreciated </S>",
    "<S> . it also suggests a possible explanation for the numerical results recently presented in @xcite , which counter - intuitively observed many body localization in an interacting model , when the non - interacting limit contained a single particle mobility edge .    </S>",
    "<S> the system we consider consists of a @xmath0 dimensional lattice which hosts two species of spinless fermions - @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 fermions are present with density @xmath3 and have hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hopping , @xmath6 is a nearest neighbor interaction , and @xmath7 is a random potential , drawn from a distribution of width @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the distribution is sufficiently large that the @xmath1 particles in isolation are in an mbl phase , with a localization length @xmath9 we do assume that @xmath8 is the largest scale in this hamiltonian , and sets the characteristic energy scale of the mbl system . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the @xmath2 particles are present with density @xmath10 , and have hamiltonian @xmath11 this hamiltonian in isolation describes a system in an ergodic phase ( the ground state will be a fermi liquid ) . the coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems is taken to have the form @xmath12 for simplicity in this work we assume @xmath13 , </S>",
    "<S> although varying the ratio of the two densities would also be an interesting parameter to tune in future work . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two models . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider a model ( model i ) where the coefficients @xmath14 are taken from some distribution ( e.g. box distribution ) of width @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider a model ( model ii ) where the @xmath14 are _ uniform _ , with strength @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> many of the results are easier to establish with a random coupling ( model i ) , and we thus discuss this model first , but we will subsequently show that a many body localization proximity effect can _ also _ arise with uniform couplings ( model ii ) .    * _ weak coupling ( small @xmath15 ) : _ * we first discuss the behavior with a weak random coupling @xmath14 taken from a distribution of width @xmath16 . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the disorder in the @xmath1 sector is the primary source of randomness . </S>",
    "<S> a many body localization proximity effect can be shown to arise in two limits : the atomic limit @xmath17 , and the non - interacting @xmath2 limit @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we establish by means of perturbative expansions that this ` many body localization proximity effect ' survives for small ( but non - zero ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , such that there exists a finite sized region of parameter space where coupling a localized system to a bath results in localization of the bath . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently show that this ` many body localization proximity effect ' also arises if the coupling is uniform rather than random .    </S>",
    "<S> _ bath close to an atomic limit : @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> _ we start by taking the limit @xmath17 . in this atomic limit for the @xmath2 fermions , the eigenstates of the combined @xmath1 and @xmath2 system take the form @xmath22 i.e. @xmath2 fermions are present on a certain set of sites @xmath23 , and the @xmath1 fermions are in a localized state , the precise wave function of which depends on the set of occupied sites @xmath23 in the @xmath2 sector . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function in the @xmath1 sector depends on @xmath24 because the distribution of @xmath2 fermions affects the random potential seen by the @xmath1 fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a random distribution of atomic - limit @xmath2 fermions will _ increase _ the effective random potential disorder in the @xmath1 sector , from @xmath8 to @xmath25 , and thus if the @xmath1 fermions are localized at @xmath26 ( uncoupled @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors ) , they should also be localized at non - zero @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn on a non - zero hopping in the @xmath2 fermion sector @xmath27 , and ask whether the resulting system is still localized . the hopping of a single @xmath2 fermion changes the interaction energy between @xmath1 and @xmath2 fermion sectors by an amount of order @xmath15 ( we are working here with random couplings @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it may also change the interaction energy in the @xmath2 fermion sector by an amount of order @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , naively a single hop by a @xmath2 fermion takes the system ` off shell ' by an random number drawn from a distribution of width at least @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the hopping of a single @xmath2 fermion changes the potential seen by the @xmath1 fermions , and thus in the @xmath1 fermion sector acts like a ` quantum quench . ' </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss to what extent the @xmath1 fermion system may be able to relax to accommodate this change in energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 sector is in a localized phase , thus it will not be able to bring the system back precisely on shell . rather , the @xmath1 fermion sector should act like a ` finite sized bath ' , with the localization length setting the size , and @xmath28 being the entropy density . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant level spacing will thus be @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping of a @xmath2 fermion , combined with an appropriate relaxation in the @xmath1 sector on length scales short compared to @xmath30 , must thus take the system off shell by at least @xmath31 .    to evaluate the convergence ( or not ) of the locator expansion @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the change in energy must be compared to the associated matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element between the two states is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the initial and final states in the @xmath1 sector . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the two states differ only on length scales less than @xmath30 ( ignoring rare long range resonances ) . </S>",
    "<S> we make the standard assumption that the eigenstates are ` ergodic ' on length scales less than @xmath30 i.e. that the initial state has similar overlap with all @xmath35 possible final states that differ from the initial state only on length scales shorter than @xmath30 , and also that the @xmath35 possible overlap matrix elements have random phases . </S>",
    "<S> demanding normalization of the final wave function , we then conclude that a typical overlap matrix element @xmath36    the locator expansion will converge if the typical hopping matrix element is smaller than the amount by which the hop takes the system off shell . from the estimates above , we conclude that a locator expansion in small @xmath19 will converge iff @xmath37 as long as this condition is satisfied , the combined @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems will both be localized , with eigenstates that are ` close ' to the form ( [ eig1 ] ) . thus in this there regime is a clear mbl proximity effect where coupling a localized system to a bath ends up localizing the bath instead . when this condition is violated , the locator expansion breaks down , which _ may _ indicate delocalization .    </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis may be readily generalized to uniform couplings of strength @xmath15 ( model ii ) . as long as the density pattern in the @xmath1 sector is spatially inhomogenous ( which should be the case in the localized regime ) , </S>",
    "<S> the _ effective _ coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors will be random , drawn from a distribution of width @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the width of the density distribution in the @xmath1 sector . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous argument may then be constructed for a many body localization proximity effect at weak @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we caution however that in the limit of site localization of @xmath1 fermions @xmath40 , with uniform couplings , the effective disorder introduced in the @xmath2 fermion sector is binary , and has percolating equipotential surfaces which break the locator expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is absent with model i couplings .    _ </S>",
    "<S> a weakly interacting low dimensional bath : @xmath41 and @xmath42 _    in this regime traditional locator expansions @xcite fail , but we can still use weak localization results . let us begin by taking @xmath18 . in this limit , the @xmath2 fermions are described by a quadratic hamiltonian , which takes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a static random variable ( since the @xmath1 fermions are in a localized phase ) , and can be interpreted as a disorder potential , with the precise realization of the disorder depending on the state in which the @xmath1 fermions are prepared . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the d - fermion hamiltonian describes fermions hopping in a random potential . </S>",
    "<S> it does not particularly matter whether we work with model i couplings ( random coupling constants ) or model ii ( uniform coupling constants ) , since as long as the density pattern in the @xmath1 sector is inhomogenous the @xmath2 fermions will see an effective random potential anyway . </S>",
    "<S> we choose to work with model i for convenience and specificity . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , free fermions hopping in a random potential will inevitably localize in @xmath42 @xcite , with a localization length @xmath45 that is power law large in @xmath46 for @xmath47 and exponentially large in @xmath46 for @xmath48 .    the argument above is cleanest in the site localization limit @xmath49 , when the @xmath50 coupling is diagonal in the @xmath1 eigenbasis and there is no appreciable back action on the @xmath1 system . at non - zero @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , there will be an effective four @xmath2 fermion interaction mediated by the @xmath1 fermions . </S>",
    "<S> this four fermion interaction may be estimated in the manner of @xcite and will be of order @xmath51 for @xmath52 and of order @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( see supplement for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are working here in units where the lattice scale has been set to one . since an interaction </S>",
    "<S> is already induced by the @xmath1 sector , we can also turn on the intrinsic interaction @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements of this interaction in the basis of localized wave functions @xmath56 will be @xmath57 , where we have made use of normalization of the wavefunctions .    </S>",
    "<S> the locator expansion should converge ( such that the dressed eigenstates of the interacting problem are close to the eigenstates of the non - interacting problem ) , if the matrix elements of the interaction ( both intrinsic and induced ) are less than the accessible level spacing @xmath58 i.e. @xmath59 we note in particular that in one ( two ) dimensions , @xmath45 is power - law ( exponentially ) large in @xmath46 . for there to be a well controlled weak localization regime , we therefore require not only that @xmath20 is small , but also that either @xmath60 or that @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we note also that the convergence criterion ( [ cond2 ] ) is simply an estimate obtained by considering the leading order terms in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation to all orders along the lines of @xcite is beyond the scope of the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> as long as the interactions ( both intrinsic and induced ) are sufficiently weak , the wavefunction will take the form @xmath62 i.e. the @xmath2 fermions are in a product state where a set @xmath63 of the non - interacting wave functions are occupied , the precise shape of the non - interacting wave functions depends on the state @xmath64 in which the @xmath1 fermions are prepared , and the @xmath1-fermions are in a state @xmath64 which is many body localized , but depends in its detailed structure on the state of the @xmath2-fermions .    _ </S>",
    "<S> strong coupling ( large @xmath15 ) _ we now point out that a many body localization proximity effect also arises for _ arbitrary _ @xmath20 and @xmath65 in the limit @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this for model ii ( uniform ) couplings , but it is obviously true also for model i.    in the large @xmath15 limit , we have a description in terms of three species : ` bound states ' whereby a @xmath1 and @xmath2 fermion sit on the same site , unbound @xmath1s , and unbound @xmath2s . </S>",
    "<S> a bound state can not break apart or form , because this would change the energy by an amount of order @xmath15 , which is the largest energy scale in the problem .    </S>",
    "<S> the unbound @xmath1 fermions are governed by a hamiltonian of the form ( [ hc ] ) , but now with certain lattice sites forbidden ( the sites occupied by the @xmath50 pairs and the unpaired @xmath2s ) . since the @xmath1 fermions localized with all lattice sites allowed , and the forbidding of certain lattice sites only presents an obstruction to transport , the unpaired @xmath1 fermions should still be localized . meanwhile , the bound @xmath50 pairs are extremely heavy , with an effective hopping matrix element of order @xmath67 , and they see the same disorder potential as the @xmath1 fermions . thus , if the @xmath1 fermions localized in a disorder potential of magnitude @xmath8 , then the @xmath50 composites should localize also . finally , that leaves the unpaired @xmath2 fermions . </S>",
    "<S> these live on a random lattice , obtained from the original lattice by deleting all sites on which unpaired @xmath1s and @xmath50 pairs are present . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is because hopping onto an ` occupied ' site changes the energy by an amount of order @xmath15 , and in the large @xmath15 limit this effectively makes occupied sites inaccessible ) . in one dimension , </S>",
    "<S> any finite density of deleted sites causes the ` lattice ' on which the unpaired @xmath2 fermions move to break up into finite sized segments , on which the @xmath2 fermions are localized . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in one dimension , in the @xmath66 limit , we clearly have a system of three distinct simultaneously localized species , regardless of the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in higher dimensions too , when a sufficiently large number of sites are deleted ( large @xmath15 limit ) , the lattice on which the unpaired @xmath2 fermions live will break into disconnected clusters , and at this point the @xmath2 fermions will most certainly be localized . thus , there must be a regime in which the coupling of system and bath leads to the formation of localized species : localized @xmath1 fermions , localized @xmath50 composites , and @xmath2 fermions which live on isolated islands that are separated by regions containing either @xmath1 fermions or @xmath50 composites . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , work on quantum percolation @xcite suggests that for non - interacting @xmath2 fermions ( or , presumably , weakly interacting d - fermions ) , the localization transition _ precedes _ the percolation transition , and @xmath2 fermions will quantum localize even before the lattice on which they live breaks up into disconnected clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the density of deleted sites may be tuned by varying either the density of particles or the energy of the state ( and hence the number of @xmath50 pairs ) , and the quantum percolation ( and hence localization ) transition may also be tuned in this way .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that in principle there is an ` exchange ' process by which an unbound @xmath1 and a @xmath50 composite on adjacent sites could exchange position by moving the @xmath2 fermion , without taking the system off shell . </S>",
    "<S> this is really only possible if the @xmath1 fermions are in the site - localization limit @xmath68 ( since the @xmath50 composites are always site localized in the large @xmath15 limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this limit of site localization for @xmath1 fermions , localization requires the additional condition that the set of possible energy conserving @xmath2 exchanges should not percolate .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath15 is large but not infinite , then @xmath2 fermions will in principle be able to ` tunnel through ' the barriers presented by @xmath1 fermions , but virtual processes involving @xmath50 composites will then also give rise to a random onsite potential for the lattice on which the @xmath2 fermions live ( inherited from the inhomogenous density pattern for the @xmath1 fermions ) . in low dimensions and in the non - interacting limit @xmath18 , and for sufficiently large @xmath15 , this will be sufficient to localize the @xmath2 fermions , and arguments along the lines of @xcite suggest the @xmath2 fermions will continue to be localized for small but non - zero @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the existence of a  </S>",
    "<S> many body localization proximity effect in the limit of weakly interacting @xmath2 fermions is not particularly surprising , since something similar occurs for weak @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the truly novel feature is the existence of an mbl proximity effect at arbitrary @xmath69 in the limit @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion : _ thus , we have demonstrated that when a many body localized system is coupled to a bath , the end result can be the survival of mbl in the system , and the localization of the bath . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that this happens in three distinct limits : a bath close to the atomic limit that is weakly coupled to a strongly localized system , a weakly interacting bath weakly coupled to a strongly localized system , and an bath ( with arbitrary bath parameters ) that is _ strongly _ coupled to a localized system . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of localized systems coupled to baths is thus much richer when the back action on the bath is taken into account , and indeed the coupling of a localized system and a delocalized system can result in the localization of both . </S>",
    "<S> this may explain recent numerical results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the development of a general theory of localized systems coupled to baths is an interesting challenge for future work .    </S>",
