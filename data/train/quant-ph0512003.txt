    "other similar issues leading to the same gup have been also initiated by some authors @xcite .",
    "one major consequence of the gup is the appearance of minimal uncertainties in position and/or momentum leading to an uv / ir mixing , which allows to probe short distance physics ( uv ) from long distance one ( ir ) .",
    "a minimal uncertainty in position or minimal length has appeared in different context like string theory ven , groos , amati , loop quantum gravity @xcite and non - commutative field theories @xcite .",
    "the minimal length defines a scale below it the physics becomes inaccessible , leading to a natural cut - off which prevents from the usual uv divergencies .",
    "recently the schrodinger equation in momentum space for the harmonic oscillator with minimal lengths in arbitrary dimensions has been solved kempf0,kempf1,minic .",
    "the cosmological constant problem and the classical limit of the physics with minimal lengths have been also investigated chang , chang01 . on the other hand",

    "we are interested by the effect of the presence of minimal lengths on the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of one dimensional quantum mechanical systems in singular potentials , like the attractive dirac potential and coulomb potential . in section 2 , after implementing the minimal length via generalized position and momentum operators , we derive fundamental relations for our caulculations . in sections 3 and 4 ,",

    "\\label{gup}\\]]a consequence of this relation , is the appearance of a minimal length given by @xmath4which means a lost of localized states in the @xmath5-space since we can not probe the coordinates space with a resolution less than the minimal length . in this situation",
    "we use the momentum space representation and maximally localized states to define a quasi position representation @xcite .",
    "then the existence of a one parameter familly of position basis related to the minimal length allows us to write @xmath6 where the vectors @xmath7 represent maximal localisation states in the sence that @xmath8 .",
    "they are normalized states unlike the ones of ordinary quantum mechanics . in the following we derive neccessary relations for our calculation taking in mind that we must recover the usual quantum mechanics in the limit @xmath9 .    using the maximally localized vectors we derive  the following maximally localized wavefunction @xmath10these states are far from being the well known plane waves .",
    "however in the limit @xmath9 and choosing the normalization constant @xmath11  as @xmath12 we recover the usual planes waves of ordinary quantum mechanics.on the other hand the states defined by eq.([plane ] ) are physical ones since   @xmath13using the completness relation @xmath14 and @xmath15 we obtain @xmath16with the aid of the relation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the roots of @xmath19 , we finally get@xmath20from this equation we have the usual completeness relation for the eigenstates @xmath21 @xmath22let us finally show that the maximally localized states @xmath23 like the coherent states , do not form an orthogonal set .",
