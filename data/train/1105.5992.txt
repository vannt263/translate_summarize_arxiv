    "the research on solving systems of polynomial equations has experienced a rapid development in the last two decades , both from a theoretical and from a practical perspective .",
    "many of the recent advances are based on the study of the general idea of homotopy continuation methods : let @xmath0 be the system whose solutions we want to find , and let @xmath1 be another system whose solutions we already know . then , join @xmath1 and @xmath0 with a _ homotopy _",
    ", that is a curve @xmath2 in the vector space of polynomial systems , such that @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and try to follow the curves ( homotopy paths ) produced as a solution @xmath5 of @xmath1 is continued along the homotopy to a solution @xmath6 of @xmath2 . when @xmath7 approaches @xmath8 , an approximation of a zero @xmath9 of @xmath0 is obtained .    in order to describe such a method explicitly , we need two essential ingredients :    1 .   a construction of the starting system @xmath1 and the homotopy path @xmath2 , and , 2 .",
    "[ item:2 ] once this path @xmath2 is chosen , a procedure to approximate @xmath6 ( for a finite sequence of values of @xmath7 starting with @xmath10 and ending with @xmath11 ) .",
    "the first of these two ingredients has been intensively studied from many perspectives , mainly using linear homotopy paths , i.e. once @xmath12 is chosen , @xmath5 a solution of @xmath1 , we just consider the path @xmath13 . in @xcite",
    "a particularly simple choice of @xmath12 was conjectured to be a good candidate for a initial pair , i.e. the complexity of homotopy methods with this starting pair could be polynomial on the average .",
    "this is still a challenging open conjecture that has been experimentally confirmed in @xcite . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite it was proved that randomly chosen pairs @xmath12 guarantee average polynomial complexity .",
    "in @xcite a system whose zeros have coordinates equal to the roots of unity of appropriate degrees was proved to guarantee average quasi  polynomial complexity ( polynomial for fixed degree . )    in this paper we deal with the second of the two questions above , restricting ourselves to the case when the homotopy path that is followed is regular , i.e. , @xmath6 is a regular zero of @xmath2 for every @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "there exist several software packages which perform the path  following task of item @xmath15 above ( here is an incomplete list : bertini @xcite , hom4ps2 @xcite , nag4m2  @xcite , and phcpack @xcite ) . in general , an initial step @xmath16 is chosen , and a _ predictor _ step ( a numerical integration step of the differential equation @xmath17 ) is made to approximate @xmath18 .",
    "a _ corrector _ step ( several steps of newton s method ) is then used to get a better approximation of @xmath18 .",
    "this process is repeated by choosing @xmath19 until @xmath11 is reached .",
    "the software implementations mentioned above achieve spectacular practical results , with huge systems solved in a surprisingly short time . as a drawback ,",
    "these fast methods make heuristic choices ( notably the choice of @xmath20 ) , which may introduce uncertainty in the quality of the solutions they provide : _ how close to an actual zero is the given output ? is the method actually following the path @xmath6 or maybe a path  jumping occurred in the middle ? _    in figure [ fig : jumping ] we illustrate a _ path  jumping _ phenomenon that may occur when a heuristic predictor  corrector path  tracking procedure is used .",

    "smale @xmath24test from @xcite , @xcite can be used to make this task rigorously , see @xcite for an implementation of that test . once detected ,",
    "this can be remedied by rerunning the heuristic procedure with tighter tolerances and higher precision of the computation .",
    "however , an analysis of the end solutions would fail to detect the shortcomings of a heuristic method in the scenario with two approximation sequences `` swapping '' two paths as in figure  [ fig : swapping ]    ( 300,220 ) ( 10,10 ) ( 10,0)@xmath21 ( 2,55)@xmath8 ( 2,185)@xmath22 ( 0,122)start ( 14,140)(0,1)40 ( 14,110)(0,-1)40 ( 270,0)@xmath8 ( 281,76)@xmath22 ( 281,190)@xmath8 ( 258,135)target ( 275,150)(0,1)35 ( 275,125)(0,-1)35    in @xcite , a method which guarantees that path  jumping does not occur was shown for the first time , and its complexity ( number of homotopy steps ) was bounded above by a quantity depending on the maximum of the so  called _ condition number _ along the path @xmath25 , see ( [ eq : conditionnumber ] ) below .",
    "this result was recently improved in @xcite , changing the maximum of the condition number along the path to the length of the path @xmath25 in the `` condition metric '' ( see section [ sec : compandcond ] for details ) .",
    "however , the result in @xcite does not fully describe an algorithm , for the explicit choice of the steps @xmath20 is not given . describing a way to actually choose these steps",
    "is a nontrivial task that can be done in several fashions .",
    "there are three independent papers doing this job : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize in table [ table : methods ] the properties of the algorithms in those papers and of the algorithm in this paper too .",
    "the proof of the algorithm in @xcite is probably the shortest of the ones mentioned . as a small drawback",
    ", its complexity is not bounded above by the length of the path @xmath25 in the condition metric , but by the integral of the square of the condition number along the path @xmath2 , which is in general a ( non  dramatically ) greater quantity .",

    "the algorithm of this paper can provide the _ status of a theorem _ to all of the computational results on up to @xmath27 : the cases that can be certified within a day appear in bold in table  [ table : galois ] .",
    "the corresponding runs of the algorithm for @xmath27 involve tracking homotopies for six polynomial equations following the paths in @xmath28 and have input , output , and all intermediate approximate zeroes defined over gaussian integers @xmath29 $ ] . due to the use of our algorithm to reduce the size of the integers in the intermediate steps , in this relatively large computation",
    "we do not encounter integers longer than _ six _ decimal digits amongst the coordinates of _ all _ approximate zeroes computed along all homotopy paths .",
    "let us remark that the largest certifiable case is already beyond the reach of purely symbolic algorithms ( the problem with 14 solutions in @xmath27 is characterized as `` not computationally feasible '' in @xcite ) .",
    "there are several ways to push the frontier of provable results further .",
    "one is a low - level optimized implementation of our algorithm .",
    "another is using a fast heuristic homotopy tracker to find the `` interesting '' paths ( e.g. , the ones that do not lead to a redundant permutation in the galois group computation ) , break them up into a union of smaller pieces , and then execute a certified homotopy tracker for every small piece .",
    "the last step is trivially parallelizable and can be sped up in practice by using distributed computing .",
    "we recall first two lemmas ( * ? ? ? * lemma 4 and lemma 5 ) .",
    "the second of these two lemmas is recalled here in a less general version than the original .",

    "let @xmath63 from ( [ eq : hypz0 ] ) and lemma [ lem : homoto1b ] we get @xmath64 from ( [ eq:22 nm ] ) and ( [ eq : varphihatvsmuprev ] ) , we have : @xmath65 where for the last equality we have used that @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the second inequality of ( [ eq : varphicompareb ] ) , together with ( [ eq : varphihatvsmu ] ) , then implies ( [ eq : varphivsmu ] ) .",
    "it also follows that @xmath68 thus , lemma [ lem : homoto2 ] applies and we conclude that @xmath69 can be continued to @xmath70 , a zero of @xmath49 , for @xmath40 .",

    "hence , we have @xmath88 from ( [ eq : appzeroproved2teor ] ) and ( [ eq : te4b ] ) , lemma [ lem : homoto1b ] then yields @xmath89 moreover , from lemma [ prop : aptproj ] , ( [ eq : appzeroproved2teor ] ) implies that @xmath90 is an approximate zero of @xmath0 with associated zero @xmath9 . in particular ,",

    "now , this last equality and ( [ eq : varphifromlem5 nm ] ) imply : @xmath97 @xmath98 because @xmath99 is a decreasing function of @xmath100 and @xmath101 we conclude that @xmath102 @xmath103 on the other hand , using again ( [ eq : auxiliar ] ) , we have @xmath104 @xmath105 note that ( [ eq : cotainth ] ) and ( [ eq : cotainth2 ] ) prove ( [ eq : teorconc2 ] ) .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem [ th : onestep ] .",
    "one can just apply the change of variables formula to the change of variables @xmath71 ( so that @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) and , after a long computation prove that the two integrals of the lemma are equal . however , we prefer the following geometric argument .",
    "the quantity @xmath109 is by definition the length of the path @xmath110 when @xmath111 is endowed with the condition metric , resulting from multiplying the usual product metric by the square of the condition number at each pair @xmath112 .",
    "now , as a length , it is independent of the parametrization and thus @xmath113 .",
