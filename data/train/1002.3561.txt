    "inhomogeneities can act as an effective trapping to collective excitations in nonlinear media . in the field of nonlinear integrated optics , the first theoretical works on guided waves by an interface between a linear and nonlinear medium appeared in @xcite .",

    "a next fundamental question is whether or not the standing waves are stable to propagation along the nonlinear waveguide .",

    "using variational arguments , a criterion was derived relating the soliton linear stability and the slope of the corresponding power - dispersion curve , i.e.  the known vakhitov - kolokolov condition .",
    "the method was later rigorously justified by weinstein in @xcite , and in @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies extend the condition for various situations , including inhomogeneous problems @xcite ( see also a recent brief review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an interesting waveguide system was proposed in @xcite , consisting of a self - focusing schrdinger equation and a self - defocusing type inhomogeneity with finite length .",
    "it is experimentally feasible to fabricate such a waveguide using the current technology as self - focusing and self - defocusing can be achieved in the same medium , structure , and wavelength @xcite . in the context of a bose - einstein condensation @xcite , which is also modeled by a nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , such a sign - changing nonlinearity coefficient can be created by spatially varying the condensate s atomic scattering length making the so - called collisionally inhomogeneous nonlinearity @xcite .",

    "the self - defocusing inhomogeneity has a small nonlinearity coefficient , such that the characteristics of the stationary solutions are closely related to the corresponding linear problem .",

    "we study the existence and stability of symmetric and asymmetric solutions , particularly the fundamental and the first excited mode , when the nonlinearity coefficient of the defocusing inhomogeneity is of the same order as the focusing bounding regions .",
    "we show that continuing from the linear limit solutions , there is a saddle - node bifurcation at which the symmetric mode becomes unstable and asymmetric modes emerge .",
    "even though it is similar to the results reported in @xcite , there is a significant difference where the asymmetric positive solutions are all stable in their existence region .",

    "the proof is exactly the same as in the proof of lemma [ lem : asym ] , except that : @xmath180 because we are in the left half plane .",
    "this change of sign therefore changes the sign of @xmath99 .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate that @xmath153 .",
    "this is done in exactly the same way as in the proof of the second case of theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "similarly , as in the second case of theorem [ th : main ] , one shows that @xmath181 .",
    "this is done by using the cross product of the appropriate vectors under the flows of the outer system , showing that the first coordinate of the tangent vector under the flow of the variational equation is first positive , then negative , then positive , and finally ends up negative because of lemma [ lem : asym2 ] .",
    "these three sign changes mean that the vector has passed through the vertical at least three times , and hence we have an unstable standing wave .",
    "[ rem2 ] the solution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4_num](a ) ( see the corresponding phase - portrait in fig .",
    "[ fig4_num_pp](a ) ) belongs to the class of solutions discussed in corollary [ cor : excited ] .",
    "nevertheless , the symmetric solution corresponding to point c in fig .  [ fig3_num ] ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig4_num](c ) and its phase - portrait [ fig4_num_pp](c ) ) does not belong to the same class of solutions . in the phase - space , the orbit of the latter solution",
    "is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig4:subfig1](a ) .",
    "this is similar to the configuration of the orbit in corollary [ cor : excited ] , which is a symmetric ( about the @xmath55-axis ) solution in the phase space with the properties @xmath182 , @xmath174 and @xmath183 , but here @xmath184 . in this case , the inner orbit lies outside the heteroclinic orbit of the inner system . in this configuration , we have that @xmath185 and @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that the above method can not be used to prove the instability of such a solution . in fig .",
    "[ fig4:subfig1](b ) , we plot the positive spectrum @xmath169 of the operator @xmath165 for unstable symmetric solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig3_num ] , where one can see that @xmath186 only in some interval .",
    "we conjecture that the break down of our method occurs at the points where the branch containing point b and that containing points d and e emerge with the main branch corresponding to symmetric solutions .",
    "we remark that there are certain choices of @xmath38 and @xmath64 , and @xmath187 such that the inner part of the superimposed phase portrait will be part of a periodic orbit of the inner system .",
    "this applies for example if we keep the @xmath61 and @xmath183 as in corollary [ cor : excited ] , we can allow the trajectory to follow the periodic orbit for as many periods as we like , and can calculate the net effect on the stability of the standing wave as a whole .",
    "one can show that if the base point travels along the inner orbit described by ( [ eq : inneru0 ] ) from @xmath62 for exactly one period , the solution to the variational equation will have exactly 2 more zeros , as will the original solution .",
    "thus for each period @xmath188 , and so we still have an unstable excited solution . in this way we are capable of constructing unstable excited solutions with @xmath189 zeros for an arbitrary @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ fig2:subfig2 ] is a phase portrait for such a standing wave solution .",
    "it remains to determine which choices of @xmath38 , @xmath190 , and @xmath187 that will produce such an excited state . using the geometry of the superposed phase portraits we have that such an excited steady state solution will exist when    @xmath191    the above technique can be used to create a higher order excited state whenever",
    "the inner part of the phase curve is part of a periodic orbit .",
    "we can simply follow the period as many times as is necessary and the higher order state will have the same difference of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . thus if we begin with an unstable state where @xmath192 and @xmath193 being the initial values for @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the inner part of the orbit is periodic ( for another example c.f .",
    "figure([fig1:subfig1 ] ) ) , we can produce higher order unstable states with @xmath194 and @xmath195 , and for all integer values of @xmath99 we will still have an unstable state .",
    "[ fig3 ]    the techniques described and used in the section above can not be applied to the asymmetric states considered in this paper because such states do not satisfy the condition in theorem [ th : ckrtj88 ] .",
    "as particular examples , we consider two solutions with @xmath196 and @xmath197 .    for positive solutions @xmath196 , when @xmath198 , asymmetric orbits will be present .",
    "an example of the phase portrait of a positive asymmetric solution is in fig .",
    "[ fig3:subfig1 ] . for this case",
    ", it can be calculated that @xmath199 . the profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1_num](c ) with its phase - portrait depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1_num_pp](c ) belongs to this class of asymmetric solutions . as we know numerically that asymmetric positive solutions are stable ( see fig .  [ fig1_num ] ) , it is expected that theorem [ th : ckrtj88 ] should not apply here .",
    "it is then interesting to know whether the stability can be established analytically .",
    "numerically ( not shown here ) we observed that @xmath200 for the asymmetric positive state . if one could show analytically that @xmath200 indeed",
    ", one would be able to prove the stability using the theorem presented in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the solution stability is expected and predicted using the method of @xcite .",
    "excited asymmetric orbits where @xmath201 and @xmath185 can occur for all configurations of @xmath38 and @xmath190 .",
    "such an orbit is described by the following properties . if @xmath202 , then for the point of departure @xmath66 , we have that @xmath203 and @xmath204 . the orbit then travels through the @xmath177 axis in the phase plane and reconnects with the outer orbit at the point @xmath62 where @xmath205 and @xmath206 . moreover , in this configuration of @xmath38 and @xmath64 , the only type of inner orbit that can produce such an asymmetric solution happens to be periodic and symmetric about the line @xmath207 in the phase plane .",
    "thus @xmath208 , and the original vector tangent to the homoclinic orbit ( @xmath80 ) gets mapped by the variational flow of the inner orbit to the tangent space of the homoclinic orbit at the point @xmath209 .",
    "thus we know @xmath210 that is the limit under the variational flow of the vector which was originally tangent to the homoclinic orbit is the stable subspace of the variational flow at the critical point at the origin .",
    "we can therefore only conclude that @xmath42 is exactly @xmath211 .",
    "if we are in the case where @xmath212 , and @xmath175 , then we can exploit the same symmetry conditions as above for such asymmetric solutions , even concluding the limit of the variational solution under the tangent flow as the stable subspace of the critical point at the origin .",
    "an example of one such orbit is in figure [ fig3:subfig2 ] , which is a sketch of the profile shown in figs .   [ fig4_num](d ) and ( e ) .",
    "if however , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , then no such periodic orbits exist , i.e. there is no connected inner orbit where @xmath66 and @xmath62 could have the aforementioned properties .",
    "we have considered a nonlinear schrdinger equation with a non - uniform nonlinearity coefficient . in particular , we have investigated a schrdinger equation with self - defocusing nonlinearity bounded by self - focusing one .",
    "the present work extended the results of .",
    "we have established analytically the instability of symmetric states beyond a critical norm through the application of a topological argument developed in @xcite .",
    "even though the technique does not definitively establish instability in the case of the asymmetric states considered in this paper , we have numerically established the stability of some positive asymmetric states .",
