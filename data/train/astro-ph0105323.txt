    "this means that it is far from the hydrodynamic ( collision - dominated ) regime , and much closer to the collisionless regime .",
    "therefore the hydrodynamical analysis above does not cover the intra - cluster gas .",
    "pressure fluctuations do not disappear , but they no longer propagate as sound waves at all frequencies . while there may be sound - like waves , there will be a maximum frequency , above which there is no propagation  @xcite .    an interesting question is how the transition from propagating to non - propagating frequencies is determined , but answering this question requires a detailed kinetic - theory analysis , which will be tackled elsewhere . for present purposes , we can assume that there is an instantaneous cut - off at about the plasma frequency .",
    "for typical clusters , this gives an upper limit @xmath41 this means that standard brillouin scattering of the cmb by clusters is cosmologically insignificant , since it affects only very low frequencies .",

    "the question then is what are the cosmological implications of this result .",
    "we considered the brillouin distortion induced by clusters , but since the intra - cluster gas is not hydrodynamical , the standard analysis does not apply beyond a very low frequency , so that brillouin distortion is insignificant .",
    "the ordinary brillouin spectrum arises from light scattering off pressure fluctuations at constant entropy .",
    "when the fluid is collision - dominated , these fluctuations propagate as sound waves and generate a brillouin doublet for each wavenumber .",
    "as density decreases ( and the knudsen number approaches 1 ) , the concept of sound propagation eventually becomes meaningless . for clusters ,",
    "there is a cut - off maximum wavenumber for propagating modes , of roughly the plasma frequency , i.e. @xmath44 . thus the cmb is  protected \" from brillouin distortion over all frequencies except the very low tail .",
    "the sz effect is therefore in practice unaffected by ordinary brillouin scattering .",
    "nevertheless , there may still be some brillouin - type affects on the cmb from clusters .",
    "pressure fluctuations still exist beyond the hydrodynamic regime and , although no doublet is present in the scattered spectrum , each central ( rayleigh ) line will be broadened by an quantity proportional to the  width parameter \"  @xcite @xmath45 this means that some scattering of photons will occur due to pressure fluctuations even in the collisionless limit .",
    "the distortion induced by this broadening is of the form given by the convolution integral ( compare  @xcite ) @xmath46 ^ 2d\\nu'\\,.\\ ] ] this non - standard collisionless brillouin distortion could lead to effects at significant frequencies , and this is currently under investigation .",
    "a boltzmann equation approach to the study of time correlation functions shows that sound - wave peaks are present for wavelengths comparable to the mean free path  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because of the high densities of hot photons in the intra - cluster gas , there may be propagating modes at higher frequencies ; relativistic plasmas at high temperatures ( @xmath47  k ) may in some sense be treated as collision - dominated systems  @xcite .",
    "other arguments that suggest collective behaviour of low density plasmas far beyond the plasma frequency have been developed in  @xcite : the plasma - dynamical regime describes motions of spatially smooth , weakly damped disturbances which may oscillate at high frequencies .    in view of these points , we believe that dynamical light scattering of cmb photons in clusters should not be simply dismissed , and further investigation is warranted . furthermore , there remains the potentially more important question of whether ordinary brillouin scattering has an effect during recombination .",
