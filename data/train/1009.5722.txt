    "this is the not the first indication of condensates being present in t dwarf atmospheres .",
    "early - type t dwarfs exhibit evidence of waning cloud opacity @xcite , and sm08 have shown that t dwarf models produce excessively blue near - infrared colors without the inclusion of condensate extinction .",
    "nevertheless , several theoretical studies have concluded that condensate clouds play little or no role in shaping the near - infrared spectra of brown dwarfs cooler than @xmath91000  k , as they reside below the visible photosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "a correlation between low surface gravity and thick clouds has been noted by @xcite and @xcite based on broad - band spectral model fits ; and by @xcite and @xcite based on the delayed disruption of clouds at the l dwarf / t dwarf transition .",

    "finally , the 911  @xmath19 silicate grain feature has also been shown to be more pronounced in l dwarfs with unusually red @xmath11 colors @xcite , sources whose kinematics reflect youth and low surface gravities @xcite .",
    "atmospheric models show that two complementary effects can drive the persistence of clouds in low gravity , low - temperature brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "first , the column of atmosphere above a given pressure level is deeper in a lower gravity dwarf , and as a consequence the atmosphere is everywhere warmer at a fixed t@xmath2 .",
    "this implies that silicate clouds lie higher in these atmospheres , providing a larger column depth of extinction in regions of minimum molecular gas opacity .",
    "second , cloud models from @xcite and @xcite both predict that mean cloud particle sizes are larger in lower gravity atmospheres . in a t@xmath2 = 650  k sm08 model , for example ,",
    "the mean particle radius is roughly ten times larger for @xmath103 as compared to @xmath104 .",
    "the sub - micron particles found in higher gravity models contribute little opacity in the near - infrared because of mie - scattering effects , rendering the deep silicate cloud less visible .",
    "clouds in lower gravity dwarfs are therefore more visible and scatter more efficiently than those in their older and more massive counterparts .",
    "this interpretation explains why cloudless models have so far provided adequate fits to the spectra of @xmath8 @xmath32 5 t dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including sdss  j1416 + 1348b .",
    "metallicity is another factor to consider .",
    "cloud formation appears to be inhibited in metal - poor l subdwarfs , as exemplified by the retention of ca , ti and tio gas to cooler t@xmath2s in these objects @xcite .",
    "similarly , unusually blue l dwarfs  including the brighter companion of sdss  j1416 + 1348b  appear to have slightly metal - poor atmospheres with unusually thin clouds @xcite or fractured cloud layers @xcite .",
    "it is not unreasonable to speculate that supersolar metallicity dwarfs may have thicker clouds @xcite , yet theoretical predictions are mixed .",
    "sm08 have shown that warmer cloudy models ( t@xmath2 @xmath105 1300  k ) appear `` cloudier '' ( redder ) for supersolar metallicities . however , chemical equilibrium calculations by @xcite find that mgsio@xmath14 ( enstatite ) condenses at warmer temperatures in higher metalllicity atmospheres , leading to a deeper cloud that may be buried by gas opacity in cooler brown dwarfs .",
    "atmospheric model calculations by find that grain size and cloud optical depth do not change appreciably between [ m / h ] = 0 and + 0.5 for low - temperature brown dwarfs , although the clouds themselves expand into lower pressure regions of the atmosphere and may have a greater effect at wavelengths corresponding to minimum gas opacity .",
    "metallicity effects on cloud formation and cloud properties in cool t dwarf atmospheres clearly remains an area of further theoretical exploration .    in summary , the unexpected presence of condensate absorption in the spectrum of ross  458c ( and possibly ulas  j1335 + 1130 )",
    "can be attributed to its low surface gravity , and possibly its supersolar metallicity .",
    "this hypothesis follows similar trends observed in the l dwarfs . it also explains why clouds had not previously been needed in model fits of high surface gravity t dwarfs .",
    "the importance of clouds in shaping low gravity t dwarf spectra should nevertheless be a consideration in the characterization of planetary - mass brown dwarf candidates in local young clusters ( e.g. , ) and low - mass exoplanets recently imaged around nearby young stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "_ spitzer _ has enabled detailed studies of cold t dwarfs in the mid - infrared , where the majority of the sed emerges @xcite .",
    "model fits to mid - infrared spectral data have proven particularly robust , with agreement in continuum fluxes and prominent h@xmath10o , ch@xmath13 and nh@xmath14 bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , there have been indications that temperatures inferred from near- and mid - infrared analyses can differ significantly . a case in point",
    "is sdss  j1416 + 1348b .",

    "we find that inclusion of cloud opacity in the near - infrared modeling of this source brings inferred t@xmath2s closer to mid - infrared results , despite having minimal effect on the shape of its spectrum .",
    "even better convergence is seen for ulas  j1335 + 1130 , as our near - infrared cloudy model temperature is fully consistent with estimates based on @xmath106 $ ] color @xcite and near- to mid - infrared spectral model fits @xcite . for ross  458c",

    "the first two models are scaled according to the near - infrared normalizations from our analysis , while the leggett et al .",
    "model is scaled to the best - fit radius and distance derived in that study .",
    "the 600  k cloudy model comes much closer to reproducing the pseudo - continuum flux of the observed data than the 700  k cloudless model , but is still underluminous and predicts excessively strong nh@xmath14 absorption in the 913  @xmath19 region .",
    "this is not a cloud effect , however , but the absence of vertical mixing in the best - fit cloudy model .",
    "vertical mixing reduces nh@xmath14 and co photospheric abundances through non - equilibrium chemistry , but has little impact on the near - infrared spectrum for t@xmath2 @xmath37 1000  k @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed in our spectral modeling , as the presence or absence of vertical mixing is statistically ambiguous ( figures  [ fig_modelfit_ross458_parameters][fig_modelfit_1416_parameters ] ) .",
    "it has a profound effect on mid - infrared spectra , however , as the t@xmath2 = 600  k , @xmath8 = 4.0 , @xmath62 = 10@xmath64  @xmath65  s@xmath24 cloudy model is a good match to data for ulas  j1335 + 1130 ( i.e. , consistent within the observational uncertainties ) .",
    "as such , the inclusion of cloud opacity does not appear to modify mid - infrared analyses for the coldest t dwarfs .",
    "convergence between near - infrared and mid - infrared spectral model fit parameters and temperature scales for cold t dwarfs is important for both near- and long - term study of these objects . with _",

    "rather , accurate reproduction of ground - based near - infrared spectroscopy , facilitated by sensitive instruments such as fire , will be necessary to study the physical characteristics and demographics of these intrinsically faint sources .",
    "finally , we consider whether the properties of ross  458c qualify it as a `` planet '' @xcite . in terms of characteristics",
    ", the planet moniker appears appropriate .",
    "ross  458c is gravitationally bound to stellar ( hydrogen - fusing ) companions , and itself appears to have a mass below which no fusion is expected .",
    "its relative mass is roughly 1:50 compared to its companions .",
    "its surface temperature is well below those of several well - studied , so - called planets ; e.g. , ab pic b ( 2000@xmath108  k ; ) , 1rxs j160929.1 - 210524 b ( 1800@xmath3200  k ; @xcite ) , 2mass 1207 - 3932b ( 1600@xmath3100  k ; @xcite ) , and hr 8799 b ( 13001700  k , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence of clouds also lends ross  458c a decidedly planetary - like character",
    ".    however , cosmogony seems to indicate otherwise .",
    "ross  458c s 1100  au projected separation makes it highly unlikely to have formed according to the `` standard '' model ; i.e. , the accumulation of gas and dust in a circumstellar ( perhaps in this case circumbinary ) disk @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if ross  458c is a planet , it has the widest and longest ( @xmath2850,000  yr ) planetary orbit known , 2 - 4 times wider than ab pic b ( m @xmath9 0.011  m@xmath61 , @xmath109 @xmath9 260  au ; ) , 1rxs j160929.1 - 210524 ( m @xmath9 0.008  m@xmath61 , @xmath109 @xmath9 330  au ; @xcite ) , ct cha b ( m = 0.016@xmath30.006  au , @xmath109 @xmath9 440  au ; ) and uscoctio 106b ( m = 0.013@xmath110 , @xmath109 @xmath9 670  au ; @xcite ) .",
    "can planets form at these separations ?",
    "some disk fragmentation simulations have been able to produce very wide ( @xmath1111000  au ) substellar companions , albeit with extreme initial conditions ( e.g. , m@xmath112/m@xmath113 @xmath9 1 ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "planet - planet interactions have been shown to scatter sources out to orbits 1001000  au in size , although they are exceedingly rare ( @xmath1141% ) and short - lived in simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the triple nature of ross  458 may provide an angular momentum sink for such a scenario , allowing a planet to be scattered out without being ejected .",
    "all of these scenarios require dramatic  and highly fortuitous  dynamic interactions to send a planet formed in the region of a circumstellar / circumbinary disk to an orbital radius 100 times wider than jupiter s .",
    "of course , a simpler alternative may be that ross  458 formed as a `` normal '' hierarchical triple star system , albeit one with very low mass components .",
    "ross  458c therefore stands as a benchmark not just for studies of low - temperature , planetary - like atmospheres , but for the definition of the word planet in general",
    ". better characterization of the age of this system and the orbital and physical properties of its components will ultimately help us address what parameter space defines a planet , and whether `` well - defined boundaries , empirical verifiability , or logical consistency ... [ can ] overcome gut feelings '' @xcite .",
    "we have obtained fire near - infrared spectra of the faint companion ross  458c and the late - type field t dwarfs ulas  j1335 + 1130 and sdss  j1416 + 1348b .",
    "data for the first source confirm its substellar nature and identify it as a t8 dwarf , with an inferred @xmath0 = @xmath125.62@xmath30.03 and t@xmath2 = 650@xmath325  k based on empirical bolometric corrections and evolutionary models .",
    "these data also show a pronounced @xmath4-band peak and relatively red @xmath11 spectrophotometric colors , indicative of supersolar metallicity and youth that coincide with the properties of the ross  458 system ( age = 150800  myr , [ fe / h ] = + 0.2 to + 0.3 ) .",
    "fits of the data to synthetic spectra from sm08 confirm these secondary parameters , albeit with discrepant effective temperatures and distances depending on the presence or absence of condensate opacity .",
    "in fact , cloudy models provide significantly better fits to the near - infrared spectrum of ross  458c and closer agreement with its parallax distance , while also providing marginally better fits to data for ulas  j1335 + 1130 and sdss  j1416 + 1348b .",
    "the fact that cloud opacity effects are more pronounced in the spectra of ross  458c and ulas  j1335 + 1130 indicates that clouds are particularly relevant for shaping the spectra of young , low - gravity brown dwarfs , and/or those with supersolar metallicities , following trends seen in the warmer l dwarfs .    despite the improvement",
    ", model fits to brown dwarf spectra remain a work in progress .",
    "the cloudy models `` overcorrect '' @xmath48- and @xmath15-band fluxes and underestimate absolute fluxes in the case of ross  458c .",
    "both shortcomings suggest that thinner clouds ( e.g. , @xmath63 = 3 or 4 ) may be needed to accurately account for condensate extinction , in line with values inferred for l / t transition objects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the limited sample examined here may not be representative of the greater population of low - temperature , low surface gravity t dwarfs .",
    "a comprehensive modeling effort can more fully explore the properties of clouds in these objects , while accurate parallax measurements would provide the necessary empirical constraints on surface fluxes .",
    "nevertheless , our results indicate that by including condensate opacity in t dwarf spectral models , more accurate determinations of the physical parameters of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets are possible with near - infrared spectroscopy alone .",
