    "gauge natural theories have recently been shown to encompass a wide class of physically relevant field theories ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite@xcite for definitions and applications ) .",
    "in fact , a fundamental field theory is necessarily _ gauge natural _ , especially when gauge transformations and/or spinors are involved ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the gauge natural formalism consists basically in assigning a suitable principal bundle @xmath0 , called the _ structure bundle _ of the theory , and assuming that symmetries can be identified with the automorphisms group @xmath1 .",
    "then the bundle of physical configurations is necessarily a gauge natural bundle @xmath2 associated to @xmath3 via some suited group representation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , @xmath1 acts canonically on @xmath4 , _ ( pure ) gauge transformations _ are _ vertical _ , while _ generalized gauge transformations _",
    "are general automorphisms acting on @xmath4 by means of the canonical action .",
    "gravity ( in its purely metric , metric - affine and tetrad formulations with or without a reference background ) , its interaction with yang - mills fields as well as bosonic and fermionic matter , is most suitably described in the gauge natural framework . moreover ,",
    "gauge natural theories allow a complete , general and satisfactory framework for conserved quantities .",
    "all gauge natural theories admit in fact",
    "_ superpotentials _ , i.e.  their nther currents are exact regardless of the topology of spacetime @xmath5 and there exist a basically canonical choice of the appropriate potential , which is usually called a",
    "_ superpotential _",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "_ supersymmetric theories _ and _ supergravity models _ can in fact be included in the gauge natural framework , even if supersymmetries have a number of features which set them definitely out of the standard framework for ordinary symmetries .",
    "first of all , sypersymmetries usually leave the lagrangian invariant modulo pure divergence terms and sometimes only on - shell ( i.e.  modulo terms which vanish along solutions ) . secondly",
    ", supersymmetries are not transformations on the configuration bundle , since @xmath6-parameter deformations of fields do not depend just on fields , but also on derivatives up to some ( finite ) order @xmath7 ( usually @xmath8 ) .",
    "thirdly , in supersymmetric models spinor fields are anticommuting in view of a path - integral quantization .",
    "finally , the parameter of the supersymmetries is an anticommuting spinor so that supersymmetries span a superalgebra rather than an ordinary lie algebra .",
    "here we want to give the necessary guidelines needed to enlarge the standard framework to encompass these features under a unifying geometrical and global viewpoint .",
    "further details may be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be the configuration bundle of a physical field theory and @xmath9 be local fibered coordinates on it . here",
    "@xmath10 are coordinates on spacetime @xmath5 and @xmath11 are coordinates on the standard fiber @xmath12 ( i.e.  the fields ) .",
    "a lagrangian @xmath13 is given in terms of fields and their partial derivatives up to some finite order , say @xmath14 .",
    "the lagrangian is mathematically described as an object living on the so - called _ jet - bundle _ @xmath15 having natural fibered coordinates @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are symmetric w.r.t .",
    "@xmath19 since they represent the derivatives .",

    "the standard nther theorem relies on a number of unessential hypotheses that can be relaxed . as we discussed above",
    "the first is _",
    "exact covariance_. another is the following : a vector field @xmath20 over @xmath4 is actually used to lie - drag sections .",
    "however , not all one - parameter families of sections are generated in this way and and in fact nther theorem just needs a one - parameter family such that holds true .",
    "lie - dragging can be defined along objects more general than vector fields , i.e. along so - called _ generalized vector fields _ ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall here restrict to generalized vertical vector fields of the form x = x^j(x^ , y^i , y^i_,  ,y^i__1 ",
    "_k)_j which of course are not vector fields on @xmath4 since they depend on the derivatives of fields .",
    "generalized vector fields are in fact sections @xmath33 of a bundle @xmath34 suitably defined as a _ pull - back _ of the so - called vertical bundle @xmath35 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    for each section @xmath36",
    "the composition @xmath37 is then a _ vertical vector field _",
    "defined on the image of @xmath36 and thence it can be used to drag the section itself .",
    "the lie - dragging is still defined by equation , covariance by and nther theorem follows again by prescription .[multiblock footnote omitted ]",
    "let us denote by @xmath38 the spin group of signature @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and by @xmath41 the general linear group .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the covering map exhibiting the spin group as a double covering of the corresponding orthogonal group .",
    "moreover , let us denote by @xmath43 the principal bundle of linear frames on @xmath5 , which has @xmath41 as a structure group .",
    "spinors can be defined on a general spin - manifold @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) which shall be here assumed to admit global metrics of the given signature .",
    "the first step is to regard spin structures on @xmath5 as dynamical variables by introducing as follows the so - called _ spin frames _ ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we fix a principal bundle @xmath44 with @xmath38 as structure group ; spin frames are principal morphisms @xmath45 .",
    "we consider the action on @xmath41 : ( m)(r , s ) ( m)(m ) : ( j , s , e)(s)ej^-1 and we define the associated bundle @xmath46 ; it has fibered coordinates @xmath47 and it is thence locally analogue to the frame bundle .",
    "for this reason spin frames are often identified in literature with standard frames ( _ vielbein _ ) .",
    "we stress however that these similarities have only a local nature since spin frames and ordinary frames have completely different behaviours w.r.t .",
    "lie - dragging and covariant derivative ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the bundle @xmath48 is by construction a gauge natural bundle and its sections are in one - to - one correspondence with spin frames .",
    "spin frames can be defined on any spin manifold ( even on non - parallelizable ones ) and each spin frame induces a metric by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the standard diagonal matrix with signature @xmath39 .",
    "supersymmetries strongly rely on anticommuting spinors . naively speaking ,",
    "if @xmath51 denote the components of a spinor @xmath52 then quadratic forms such as @xmath53 are assumed to be antisymmetric in the exchange of the spinors , i.e. @xmath54 , in view of a path integral quantization of the field theory ( according to fermi - dirac quantization rules for fermions ) .",
    "mathematically , this behaviour is implemented by assuming that each component @xmath51 takes its value in the odd part of the ( complexified ) exterior algebra @xmath55 of some suitable vector space @xmath56 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath57^n$ ] the space so generated ; since @xmath58 is a complex vector space of dimension @xmath59 , @xmath60 is a complex vector space and we are entitled to use anticommuting coordinates @xmath51 in @xmath60 .",
    "each @xmath51 is actually a block of @xmath59 ( complex ) ordinary coordinates .",
    "the spin group @xmath38 acts as follows on spinors by block matrix multiplication on anticommuting coordinates : : ( r , s)vv:(s , ) s^i_j^j thence we can define the associated bundle @xmath61 the sections of which are called _ anticommuting spinors_.    choosing the matrix representation of the spin group is equivalent to fix a set of dirac matrices @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) such that @xmath64 .",
    "the charge conjugation operator is defined as the element @xmath65 in the appropriate clifford algebra such that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the transpose of @xmath62 .",
    "charge conjugated spinor _ is defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the _ adjoint spinor _ , and @xmath70 is the transpose conjugate spinor .",
    "spinors which are self charge conjugated ( @xmath71 ) are called _ majorana spinors _ , provided they exist ( e.g. , this happens in @xmath72-dimension lorentzian spacetimes ) . in this case",
    "the spinor space @xmath60 splits as @xmath73 .",
    "the action of the spin group on @xmath60 preserves this splitting and thence also the bundle @xmath74 splits as @xmath75",
    ". sections of @xmath76 are in one - to - one correspondence with majorana spinors .",
    "wess - zumino model is the simplest supersymmetric model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it will be used here as an example to show that the gauge natural framework is suited to deal with all supersymmetric theories .",
    "we shall consider it on a general spin manifold @xmath5 with a fixed spin bundle @xmath44 .",
    "fields are : a spin frame @xmath77 , an anticommuting majorana spinor @xmath52 and four scalar densities @xmath78 of arbitrary weights @xmath79 . each scalar density ,",
    "say @xmath80 , is a section of a natural bundle @xmath81 associated to @xmath43 by means of the representation _ : ( m ) : ( j , a)(j)^-a fibered coordinates on @xmath82 are thence @xmath83 .",

    "we recall that strictly speaking these are not coordinates since the @xmath51 anticommute .",
    "we consider the lagrangian [ wzl]where @xmath85 denotes the determinant of the spin frame @xmath77 , @xmath86 is the inverse of @xmath77 , the covariant derivatives of the scalar densities are defined as usual , e.g. @xmath87 ; @xmath88 ( resp .",

    "e_a^(_+^ab_[_a , _ b ] )    since @xmath91 is gauge natural all automorphisms of @xmath44 act canonically on @xmath91 .",
    "the lagrangian is covariant with respect to generalized gauge transformations and consequently the theory is gauge natural in the sense of @xcite .",
    "one can thence canonically define conservation laws which admit superpotentials , as proved in general for any gauge natural theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "supersymmetries can be now introduced as generalized vector fields .",
    "let @xmath92 be a covariantly constant ( @xmath93 ) majorana spinor .",
    "let us consider the generalized vector field x = e^a _ + + aa + bb + cc + dd [ gensusy]where we set @xmath94 and notice that is a generalized vector field since it depends on the derivatives of fields .",
    "one can easily prove that these infinitesimal transformations are symmetries for the lagrangian , modulo the divergence term where @xmath95 is the @xmath96-surface local volume .",
    "first of all we have shown on a simple example that gauge natural theories may admit supersymmetries which are generalized symmetries .",
    "our example can be easily coupled to the hilbert lagrangian @xmath97 for the spin frame which describes interactions with gravity .",
    "the theory is _ necessarily _ a gauge natural theory since spin frames are truly gauge natural ( and they have to be used since ordinary frames or vielbeins globally fail in replacing spin frames in a generic topology for @xmath5 ) .",
    "another important example of supersymmetric theory is the rarita - schwinger ( rs ) model which deals with spin frames @xmath77 and a @xmath98-spinor field @xmath99 , i.e.  sections of the bundle @xmath100 associated to @xmath101 by means of the spin @xmath98 representation : ( m)(r , s)vv : ( j , s,)s^i_j ^j_(j^-1)^ _    the configuration bundle @xmath102 is gauge natural and the rs lagrangian l__rs = r^ab _ e_a^e_b^e + |__5_a__e^a_^is covariant w.r.t .",
    "generalized gauge tranformations . the theory can be shown again to be gauge natural ( see @xcite ) and again it admits supersymmetries ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this model is very popular in physical applications since the spin frame arises in it as a gauge field of supersymmetries , so that gravity can be regarded in this case as a by - product of supersymmetry .",
    "the rarita - schwinger model is currently under investigation .",
    "in particular we aim to show that supersymmetries can be regarded as automorphisms of a suitably defined principal superbundle . in this case one",
    "has a super - principal bundle to which the configuration bundle is associated as a _ super - gauge natural bundle_. the rarita - schwinger model will be thence regarded as the prototype of _ graded gauge natural theories _ which suitably extend the notion of gauge natural theory to encompass supersymmetries ( see @xcite ) .",
