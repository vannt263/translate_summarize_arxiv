    "siegel disks  the domains around fixed points of holomorphic maps in which the map is locally linearizable ( defined in more detail in section  [ sec : disks - bound ] )  are among the main objects of interest in the dynamics of holomorphic maps .",
    "their boundaries have surprising geometric properties which have attracted the attention of both mathematicians and physicists .",
    "notably , it was discovered in @xcite that in some cases there were scaling relations for the orbit , which suggested that the boundary was a fractal object . since",
    "then this phenomenon has been a subject of extensive numerical and mathematical studies @xcite .    in this paper , we report some direct numerical calculations of the hlder regularity of these boundaries for different rotation numbers of bounded type and for different maps .",
    "the main conclusion of the numerical calculations in this paper , is that , for the cases we consider , the boundaries of the siegel disks are @xmath0 curves for some @xmath1 , and we can compute numerically the value of @xmath2 . even if we  obviously  consider only a finite number of cases , we expect that the results are significative for the siegel disks of polynomials with rotation numbers which have an eventually periodic continued fraction .",
    "the values of the hlder regularity @xmath2 are , up to the error of our computation , _ universal _ in the sense of renormalization group analysis , namely that they are independent of the map in a small neighborhood in the space of maps .",
    "we also performed computations for maps whose rotation numbers have the same `` tail '' of their continued fraction expansion , and found that our numerical results depend only on the tail .",
    "our computation of the hlder regularity are based on the method introduced in @xcite , which is a numerical implementation of several constructions in littlewood - paley theory .",
    "this method was also used in @xcite .    for the case of the golden mean rotation number , the fact that the boundaries of siegel disks are hlder was proved in @xcite assuming the existence of the fixed point of the renormalization operator conjectured in  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a fixed point of a slightly different ( and presumably equivalent ) renormalization operator was proved in  @xcite .",
    "it seems that a similar argument will work for other rotation numbers with periodic continued fraction expansion provided that one has a fixed point of the appropriate renormalization operator .",
    "these arguments provide bounds to the hlder regularity  @xmath2 , based on properties of the fixed point of the renormalization operator .",
    "our computations rely on several rigorous mathematical results in complex dynamics .",

    "the plan of this paper is the following . in section  [ sec :",
    "disks - bound ] we give some background on siegel disks and explain how to parameterize their boundaries , section  [ sec : num - regul ] is devoted to the numerical methods used and the results on the regularity of the boundaries of the siegel disks and the scaling properties of the iterates . in section [ sec : radius - area ] we consider some connections with geometric characteristics of the siegel disk ( in particular , its area ) , in section [ sec : bound - regularity ] we derive an upper bound on the regularity , and in the final section  [ sec : discussion ] we recapitulate our results .",

    "<S> siegel disks are domains around fixed points of holomorphic maps in which the maps are locally linearizable ( i.e. , become a rotation under an appropriate change of coordinates which is analytic in a neighborhood of the origin ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical behavior of the iterates of the map on the boundary of the siegel disk exhibits strong scaling properties which have been intensively studied in the physical and mathematical literature .    in the cases we study , </S>",
    "<S> the boundary of the siegel disk is a jordan curve containing a critical point of the map ( we consider critical maps of different orders ) , and there exists a natural parameterization which transforms the dynamics on the boundary into a rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we compute numerically this parameterization and use methods of harmonic analysis to compute the global hlder regularity of the parameterization for different maps and rotation numbers .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that the regularity of the boundaries and the scaling exponents are universal numbers in the sense of renormalization theory ( i.e. , they do not depend on the map when the map ranges in an open set ) , and only depend on the order of the critical point of the map in the boundary of the siegel disk and the tail of the continued function expansion of the rotation number . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some possible relations between the regularity of the parameterization of the boundaries and the corresponding scaling exponents .     </S>",
    "<S> * according to a celebrated theorem by siegel , under certain arithmetic conditions , the dynamical behavior of the iterates of a holomorphic map around a fixed point of the map is very simple  the iterates of the map fill densely analytic topological circles around the critical point . in the domain around the critical behavior </S>",
    "<S> where the iterates exhibit such behavior  called siegel disks ,  there exists a complex analytic change of variables that makes the map locally a multiplication by a complex number of modulus  1 . on the boundary of a siegel disk , however , the dynamical behavior of the iterates of the map is dramatically different  for example , the boundary is not a smooth curve . </S>",
    "<S> the iterates on the boundary of the siegel disk exhibit scaling properties that have motivated the development of a renormalization group description . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamically natural parameterization of the boundary of the siegel disk has low regularity . </S>",
    "<S> we compute accurately the natural parameterization of the boundary and apply methods from harmonic analysis to compute the hlder exponents of the parameterizations of the boundaries for different maps with different rotation numbers and with different orders of criticality of their critical points . * </S>"
