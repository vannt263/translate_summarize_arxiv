    "an applied magnetic field has been a revealing tuning parameter in the study of high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "superconducting properties can be probed via the diamagnetic response of these materials to an external magnetic field . with tf-@xmath0sr ,",
    "information on the density of the superconducting carriers can be obtained by measuring the internal magnetic field distribution of a lattice of vortices generated by an external field @xcite .",
    "an applied magnetic field can also be used to partially or fully suppress superconductivity at low temperature @xmath9 , to reveal competing ground states @xcite and to detect normal quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the high field required to reach the normal state of cuprates at low @xmath9 is usually unattainable in a tf-@xmath0sr experiment .",
    "consequently , tf-@xmath0sr studies at low @xmath9 are restricted to detecting the effects of field - induced suppression of superconductivity in and around the vortex cores @xcite .    in recent years",
    "high tf-@xmath0sr has found an application in the study of the magnetic response of cuprates in the normal state above @xmath1 .",
    "it has long been believed that this region of the cuprate phase diagram holds vital clues to understanding the microscopic mechanism of high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "for example , cuprates exhibit a pseudogap at the fermi surface above @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "there is still no consensus on the origin of the pseudogap , but establishing agreement on the specific question of whether it is associated with preformed cooper pairs ( paired electrons ) or a competing phase would be a major advancement in the field .",
    "the magnetic response of cuprates above @xmath1 became a topic of immense interest after ong @xcite demonstrated that a sizeable magnetic field creates a nernst effect persisting far above @xmath1 .",
    "the nernst signal is accompanied by field - enhanced diamagnetism that persists in very large applied magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is qualitatively distinct from the fluctuating diamagnetism observed in conventional bcs superconductors @xcite , which is rapidly quenched in high fields .",
    "the nernst measurements accompany a growing body of experiments on high-@xmath1 cuprates that hint at superconducting pair correlations surviving on short time and length scales far above @xmath1 . with increasing temperature ,",
    "superconductivity is ultimately destroyed by fluctuations of the pairing amplitude , fluctuations of the phase , or both . in a conventional bcs superconductor",
    "the typical energy scale of phase fluctuations is much larger than the energy gap , which in turn is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , it is the vanishing of the pairing amplitude and not phase fluctuations that determines @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , just above @xmath1 there is a critical region characterized by amplitude ( gaussian ) fluctuations of short - lived cooper pairs .",
    "the superconducting fluctuations in this region give rise to weak diamagnetism , excess specific heat , conductivity and josephson tunneling @xcite .    the situation has been argued to be different in the high-@xmath1 cuprates @xcite , because phase fluctuations are enhanced by the reduced dimensionality associated with superconductivity being more or less confined to the cuo@xmath6 layers .",
    "in addition , a low density of superconducting carriers in the underdoped regime results in a reduced stiffness to phase fluctuations .",
    "these factors favour a situation where upon cooling , bulk superconductivity is established by the onset of _ long - range _ phase coherence at @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the simple binding of electrons into cooper pairs may occur at temperatures well above @xmath1 where amplitude fluctuations are still relatively weak .",
    "high - frequency conductivity measurements by corson @xcite show a residual meissner effect in the normal state of bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath10 associated with a finite phase stiffness on short time scales .",
    "furthermore , enhanced fluctuating diamagnetism that is uncharacteristic of conventional amplitude fluctuations has been observed in several cuprates above @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the above results on cuprates have been explained in terms of a kosterlitz - thouless transition , below which long - range superconducting order occurs . in this model",
    "the nernst effect is attributed to the destruction of long - range phase coherence of the abrikosov vortex lattice ( _ i.e. _ creation of a vortex liquid ) in a two - dimensional system by thermally generated mobile vortices above the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "this interpretation implies that there must be short - range phase coherence among cooper pairs in sizeable regions of the sample in order to nucleate vortices .",
    "yet the nernst signal above @xmath1 has also been attributed to amplitude fluctuations of short - lived cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "pourret @xcite have shown that a nernst signal caused by amplitude fluctuations is observable in a dirty bcs superconductor far above @xmath1 .",
    "likewise , rullier @xcite have demonstrated that the nernst region for yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 is expanded by disorder above a suppressed value of @xmath1 @xcite , and bergeal @xcite have provided evidence for amplitude fluctuations in cuprates above @xmath1 from measurements of the josephson effect in an optimally doped / underdoped junction .",
    "it is thus unclear from the experiments done thus far on cuprates whether the region above @xmath1 is dominated by amplitude or phase fluctuations",
    ".    there is also growing evidence that the superconducting correlations in cuprates first develop in nanoscale regions at temperatures well above @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "indeed , gomes @xcite have observed the development of spatially inhomogeneous pairing gaps above @xmath1 via scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) on bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath10 . with decreasing temperature",
    "the gapped regions proliferate in a way that is consistent with the eventual formation of the bulk superconducting phase below @xmath1 via percolation or josephson coupling of these regions .",
    "the observation of hysteresis in low - field magnetization measurements on la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 by panagopoulos @xcite could also be interpreted as indirect evidence for fluctuating diamagnetic superconducting domains above @xmath1 .",
    "more recently kanigel @xcite observed a bogoliubov - like electronic dispersion in the pseudogap region of bi@xmath6sr@xmath6cacu@xmath6o@xmath10 , also suggestive of short - range superconducting order .",
    "new studies of the nernst signal in cuprates @xcite have now clearly distinguished the individual contributions from quasiparticles and superconducting fluctuations ( phase or amplitude ) .",
    "the onset of a temperature dependence of the quasiparticle nernst signal follows the doping dependence of the pseudogap temperature @xmath11 and appears to be a consequence of developing magnetic correlations .",
    "in contrast , the vortex - like nernst signal does not persist nearly as far above @xmath1 .",
    "the above experiments on cuprates suggest that for a wide doping range the region above @xmath1 is a heterogeneous mixture of superconducting and magnetic correlations .",
    "a tf-@xmath0sr measurement is very sensitive to the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic response of such a system , due to the local - probe nature of the positive muon ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the purpose of this review is to summarize the results of recent _ high _ tf-@xmath0sr measurements on cuprates above @xmath1 .",
    "the experiments reveal a field - induced inhomogeneous line broadening that persists far above @xmath1 and extends from the underdoped to heavily overdoped regimes .",
    "as will be explained in this review , the dominant source of the line broadening is varied amongst the cuprates and is dependent on a competition between superconducting and magnetic correlations .",
    "in contrast to the closely related technique of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , @xmath0sr does not rely on the boltzmann population of spin states .",
    "consequently , application of the @xmath0sr method is not restricted by temperature , and an external magnetic field is not required to polarize the muon spins .",
    "in fact a powerful aspect of the @xmath0sr technique is that it can be used to probe extremely weak internal magnetic fields in the absence of an overwhelming external field .",
    "zero - field ( zf ) @xmath0sr has been applied extensively to cuprate systems , and has played a pivotal role in determining where magnetism occurs in the temperature versus charge doping phase diagram of these materials @xcite .",
    "the experiments of focus in this review are transverse - field ( tf ) @xmath0sr measurements , which locally probe the magnetic response of a material in the bulk . in a tf-@xmath0sr experiment the direction of the initial muon spin polarizaton *",
    "p*@xmath13 is oriented perpendicular to the applied magnetic field , as shown in figure  [ fighightfmusr ] .",
    "the muon spin precesses in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the effective local field * b*@xmath14 , which in general is a vector sum of the applied field , dipolar fields of nearby nuclear and atomic moments , and the fermi contact field of spin - polarized conduction electrons at the muon site .",
    "the latter contribution is particularly important in metals , where the @xmath12 is screened by conduction electrons .",
    "= 5.0 in    in a @xmath0sr experiment one detects the positron emitted from the decay of the implanted positive muon ( @xmath15 ) using scintillator detectors .",
    "the light produced when a muon or positron passes through a thin plastic scintillator is transported by total internal reflection through a plastic light guide to a photomultiplier tube .",
    "fast electronics are subsequently used to digitize , sort out , and store the electrical signals produced by the photomultiplier tubes .",

    "an example of equation  ( [ eq : rawcounts ] ) is shown in figure  [ figrawcounts](a ) .",
    "for a surface muon beam , where the @xmath12 are generated via the decay of pions at rest in the laboratory frame of reference , the initial muon spin polarization is nearly 100  % .",
    "this very high degree of spin polarization is one of the reasons that @xmath0sr exceeds nmr in sensitivity to bulk magnetism .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that in contrast to the majority of the nmr active nuclei in cuprates , the spin of the muon is 1/2 , and hence the @xmath12 has no quadrupole moment .",
    "consequently , the @xmath12 is a `` pure '' magnetic probe .",
    "= 6.5 in    the tf-@xmath0sr spectrum is the difference between the number of counts in the positron detectors positioned on opposite sides of the sample divided by the sum of the counts in these detectors    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the time evolution of the muon spin polarization .",
    "more generally , @xmath28 is referred to as the `` @xmath0sr asymmetry spectrum '' , and is analogous to an nmr free - induction decay signal .",
    "figure  [ figrawcounts](b ) shows an asymmetry spectrum generated by equation  ( [ eq : asymmetry ] ) .",
    "the measured tf-@xmath0sr asymmetry spectrum has error bars that increase with time due to the muon lifetime ( see figure  [ figmacdougallprb10 ] ) .",
    "the functional form of the depolarization function @xmath21 is dependent on whether the effective field * b*@xmath14 experienced by the muon is static or fluctuating in time : + _ static fields _  if the muons experience an inhomogeneous distribution of dipolar fields from static nuclear or electronic moments , or the inhomogeneous field distribution created by static vortices in the superconducting state , muons stopping at different locations experience different local magnetic fields .",
    "consequently , the muons precess with different frequencies , given by @xmath29 . over time",
    "the muon spins precessing at different frequencies dephase , causing a loss of polarization .",
    "the host nuclei usually form a dense system of randomly oriented moments that are static on the @xmath0sr time scale and create a gaussian distribution of dipolar fields at the muon site .",
    "this results in a gaussian depolarization function of the form    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the width of the gaussian field distribution along the direction of the applied field . an asymmetry spectrum with a gaussian loss of polarization is shown in figure  [ figrawcounts](b ) .",
    "barring a change in crystal structure or the onset of thermally - induced muon hopping , the depolarization rate @xmath33 associated with the nuclear moments does not depend on temperature .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath33 can depend on both the direction and strength of the applied magnetic field . in the latter situation",
    ", the nuclear moments may rapidly precess about the applied field , resulting in a reduction of @xmath33 .",
    "a dense system of randomly frozen electronic moments will also lead to a gaussian depolarization function . on the other hand ,",
    "a dilute system of random electronic moments is decribed by an exponential depolarization function that corresponds to a lorentzian distribution of internal fields @xcite    @xmath34    _ fluctuating fields _  the gaussian depolarization observed for a dense system of static moments is modified by fluctuations .",
    "fast fluctuations of the internal fields results in an exponential loss of the muon spin polarization , such that    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the fluctuation rate of * b*@xmath14 .",
    "the exponential relaxation rate @xmath37 becomes smaller as the fluctuation rate rises .",
    "this is referred to as `` motional narrowing ''  a term borrowed from nmr where one generally works in frequency space .",
    "it means that the width of the fourier transform of the tf-@xmath0sr signal is reduced as fluctuations of the local field increase .",
    "it is not always obvious whether the exponential loss of polarization is caused by fast fluctuating internal fields or a dilute system of static moments . in these instances a longitudinal field ( lf )",
    "experiment can be performed by applying a field parallel to the direction of the initial muon spin polarization .",
    "if the internal fields are static , a longitudinal field of greater magnitude will decouple the muon spin from the internal fields and no relaxation of the lf-@xmath0sr signal will be observed .",
    "alternatively , fast fluctuating internal fields cause a ( @xmath38 ) relaxation of the muon spin polarization parallel to the external field , by inducing transitions between the `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' zeeman - energy eigenstates of the muon . in this case",
    "a much higher external field is needed to decouple the muon spin from the internal fields .",
    "+ _ disorder effects _  in a system with macroscopic phase segregation , the muon will experience different local magnetic fields in the spatially - separated regions . in this case the tf-@xmath0sr signal will be comprised of well - resolved muon precession frequencies .",
    "moreover , the amplitudes of the different frequency components of the tf-@xmath0sr signal , provide a direct measure of the volume fraction of each phase .",
    "phase segregation may occur on a smaller length scale with disorder causing a spread in muon precession frequencies .",
    "of particular interest in this review is the muon depolarization rate resulting from an inhomogeneous distribution of the magnetic susceptibility . a inhomogeneous spread @xmath39 of static or time - averaged local susceptibilities @xmath40 produces a distribution of @xmath12 knight shifts @xmath41 , and hence a broadening of the tf-@xmath0sr line width @xcite .",
    "it follows that    @xmath42    in this situation the different components of the tf-@xmath0sr signal are numerous and can not be isolated , but the depolarization rate of the signal is a direct measure of the width of the inhomogeneous field distribution .      at present",
    "the only functioning high tf-@xmath0sr spectrometer in the world is _ hitime _ , located at triumf ( vancouver , canada ) .",
    "spectrometer utilizes a 7 t superconducting magnet , with detectors optimized for high transverse field .",
    "several technical constraints have to be overcome to perform a tf-@xmath0sr experiment at such high field : + ( i ) surface muon beams created from pion decay at rest in the laboratory frame , result in an initial muon spin polarization that is anti - parallel to the linear momentum of the beam .",
    "a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the momentum produces a lorentz force , which deflects the muon beam .",
    "the degree of deflection becomes problematic for fields in excess of @xmath43  t. to circumvent this problem the muon spin can be rotated perpendicular to the momentum , in which case the external magnetic field may be directed parallel to the incoming beam .",
    "this can be done only on muon beam lines equipped with a `` spin rotator '' , which is a device consisting of crossed electric and magnetic fields .",
    "+ ( ii ) at high fields the muon - spin precession period @xmath44 is reduced , so that a smaller bin width must be used in the time histogram to generate the raw time spectrum @xmath45 .",
    "however , the timing resolution of both the electronic circuitry and the detectors limits how small the bin width can be , and this in turn limits the maximum field measurable by tf-@xmath0sr . with increasing magnetic field",
    ", the initial amplitude of the tf-@xmath0sr signal decays according to @xcite    @xmath46 \\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the amplitude of the tf-@xmath0sr signal of precession frequency @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the timing resolution .",
    "figure  [ figtimeresol ] shows the field dependence of the signal amplitude of the 7  t _ hitime _ spectrometer at triumf , which has a time resolution of about 170  ps . at 7 t the signal amplitude is reduced to 60  % of the low - field value .",
    "+    = 4.5 in    \\(iii ) the incoming muons precess in the transverse field prior to implantation .",
    "if the field is uniform , all of the muon spins precess in phase , and the initial muon - spin polarization is preserved . however , if the field is non - uniform ( _ i.e. _ there are field components perpendicular to the muon beam momentum ) , the initial polarization is reduced by dephasing of the muon spins .",
    "thus , high tf-@xmath0sr experiments require superconducting magnets with good field homogeneity to be used in combination with muon beams of small cross section .",
    "unfortunately , to preserve good timing resolution the light guides that connect the plastic scintillators to the photomultiplier tubes outside the magnet bore must be kept short to minimize attenuation and broadening of the light pulses .",
    "this means that the cylindrical bore of the magnet must be kept short . but",
    "a short bore limits the field homogeneity of the magnet . in principle",
    "this limitation can be overcome by installing shim coils .",
    "+ ( iv ) at high magnetic field the decay positrons undergo cyclotron motion about the applied field directed along the beam axis .",
    "the radius of the helical trajectories of the positrons is inversely proportional to the field .",
    "hence at high field the positron detectors must be positioned closer to the sample . for surface muons that have a momentum of about 28  mev / c ,",
    "the cyclotron radius of the positrons at 7  t is only 1.3  cm .",
    "for this reason the _ hitime _ spectometer utilizes a unique compact arrangement of muon and positron counters contained within a helium - gas flow cryostat . + as a result of the above considerations , high tf-@xmath0sr instruments are not widely available . with such limited access , high tf-@xmath0sr experiments on cuprates ( using _ hitime _ at triumf )",
    "have primarily focussed on the superconducting state .",
    "but in recent years such studies have shifted attention to examining the effects of high magnetic field on the normal state above @xmath1 , and this has led to some surprising results .",
    "within the underdoped regime of cuprates , an applied magnetic field has been shown to induce static magnetic order and enhance magnetic order that is already present at @xmath50 .",
    "demler @xcite introduced a phenomenological quantum theory that describes this field - induced / enhanced effect as a competition between superconductivity and magnetic order .",
    "the original model assumes a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system that undergoes a field - induced quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from a superconductor to a state of coexisting superconducting and spin - density wave ( sdw ) orders . in 2d , long range sdw order does not survive above @xmath51 , and hence the model strictly applies to the situation at low temperatures .",
    "the dependence of the qpt on charge - carrier concentration in the theory of demler @xcite is inline with low - temperature neutron scattering experiments on underdoped cuprates that show field - induced and/or field - enhanced sdw order in hole - doped @xcite and electron - doped @xcite systems .",
    "recently , moon and sachdev @xcite have derived a microscopic theory of competing @xmath52-wave superconductivity and sdw order that reproduces the key features of the phase diagram of the phenomenological theory of demler @xcite .",
    "field - induced / enhanced competing sdw order is also detectable by tf-@xmath0sr , and has been observed in both hole - doped @xcite and electron - doped @xcite systems .",
    "however , as explained above , a shortcoming of tf-@xmath0sr is the maximum external field of 7 t that can be applied .",
    "this is particularly an issue in the yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 family where superconductivity is more robust , and consequently higher fields are required to expose or enhance the sdw order .",
    "for example , neutron scattering experiments by stock @xcite on yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath53 and yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath54 show that a 6 t field directed along the @xmath55-axis is insufficient to enhance static magnetic order via the suppression of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "field enhanced sdw order in yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath56 was recently reported by haug @xcite , but an external field having a @xmath55-axis component with a magnitude of 12.5  t was used . while neutron scattering is better suited for investigations of long - range sdw order , as a local probe tf-@xmath0sr measurements can furnish information on short - range magnetic order , disordered magnetism , and the magnetic volume fraction .",
    "= 4.5 in      in the 2d theory of demler @xcite , field - induced sdw order occurs at @xmath51 in and around the vortex cores where superconductivity is suppressed .",
    "long - range sdw order requires significant overlap of neighbouring vortices .",
    "the density of vortices and hence the degree of overlap increases with field .",
    "but the applicability of a 2d theory to the cuprates is limited by the significant coupling between the cuo@xmath6 layers in the real materials . experiments on la@xmath57sr@xmath58cuo@xmath4 show that the vortices @xcite and the field - enhanced sdw order @xcite are in fact three - dimensional ( 3d ) .",
    "kivelson @xcite have extended the phenomenological theory of demler to the case of 3d vortices and shown that the qpt is actually to a phase in which a spatially inhomogeneous competing order coexists with superconductivity . at the qpt static magnetism",
    "is expected to develop about weakly interacting vortices , but there is no long - range static magnetic order . a crossover to",
    "long - range sdw order occurs at higher field and/or lower charge carrier concentration .",
    "the situation is summarized in figure [ phasediagrams ] .",
    "the extended 3d model of kivelson is supported by low - field tf-@xmath0sr measurements , which detect static spin - glass - like ( sg ) magnetism in and around the vortex cores of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 and yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the static magnetism in the vortex - core region causes a suppression of the high - field ` tail ' of the internal magnetic field distribution @xmath59 .",
    "if the distribution of the dipolar fields of the electronic moments is sufficiently broad , this is accompanied by the appearance of a low - field tail .",
    "an example of these field - induced effects are shown in figure  [ figsonierprb07 ] for la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 at doping levels where static electronic moments are absent at @xmath60 . at @xmath61",

    "conversely , the @xmath0sr line shape at @xmath64 shows modifications of the high - field and low - field tails expected from the emergence of sg magnetism in the vortex - core region , which places this sample in the sg+sc phase shown in figure  [ phasediagrams ] . with increasing temperature the @xmath0sr line shape at @xmath64 approaches that for the higher doped samples ( see figures [ figsonierprb07](d)-(f ) ) , and just below @xmath1 the line shapes at the different dopings are nearly indistinguishable .",
    "this demonstrates the destruction of the static magnetism at @xmath64 by thermal fluctuations .",

    "a square vortex lattice is observed in la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 @xcite at much lower fields than in yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "tf-@xmath0sr measurements of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 in the sdw+sc regime show a substantial _ fast _ relaxing component associated with the sdw order @xcite .",

    "<S> the advent of high transverse - field muon spin rotation ( tf-@xmath0sr ) has led to recent @xmath0sr investigations of the magnetic - field response of cuprates above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 . here </S>",
    "<S> the results of such experiments on hole - doped cuprates are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> although these investigations are currently ongoing , it is clear that the effects of high field on the internal magnetic field distribution of these materials is dependent upon a competition between superconductivity and magnetism . in la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> the response to the external field above @xmath1 is dominated by heterogeneous spin magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnetism that dominates the observed inhomogeneous line broadening below @xmath5 is overwhelmed by the emergence of a completely different kind of magnetism in the heavily overdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the magnetism above @xmath5 is currently unknown , but its presence hints at a competition between superconductivity and magnetism that is reminiscent of the underdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the width of the internal field distribution of underdoped yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 above @xmath1 is observed to track @xmath1 and the density of superconducting carriers . </S>",
    "<S> this observation suggests that the magnetic response above @xmath1 is not dominated by electronic moments , but rather inhomogeneous fluctuating superconductivity . </S>"
