    "also the maximum corresponds to smaller amplitudes of the rmps in the quasilinear case .",

    "they determine the release of an increasing fraction of trapped trajectories , which contributes to the diffusion and increases @xmath238  this tendency is reversed after the release of all trajectories . in these conditions ,",
    "@xmath239  and it decreases with the increase of @xmath1    typical values of @xmath0  in the present experiments are less than one . in this range ,",
    "the quasilinear regime is characterized by a stronger influence of the rmps than the nonlinear transport ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the smooth threshold in the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the amplitude of the rmps is in agreement with the experiments @xcite , @xcite .        .",
    "the dashed ( red ) curve is the average velocity in the absence of rmps.,height=302 ]    the gradient of the toroidal magnetic field generates an average velocity ( [ vb ] ) of the trajectories @xmath93 determined by the rmps .",
    "a similar effect was found in the case of turbulent plasmas @xcite , @xcite . the turbulent pinch velocity is positive in the quasilinear regime corresponding to small @xmath240  and it becomes negative ( directed inward ) in the nonlinear regime ( large @xmath241 ( see figure 3 , the dashed line ) .",
    "we determine here the influence of the rmps on the turbulent pinch velocity . as seen in figure 3 , the effect is complex and it depends on the amplitude of the rmps , and on the decorrelation time of the turbulence .",
    "the rmps lead to continuous decrease of the quasilinear pinch . in the nonlinear regime , a much more complicated dependence on @xmath0",

    "however , it can be much larger than @xmath250 values of the order @xmath251  can be attained  only for @xmath252  and for large size plasmas with @xmath253 as seen in figure 3 , the pinch is positive at such values , and it contributes to confinement degradation .",
    "the direct effects of the rmps on turbulent transport were analyzed .",
    "the diffusion coefficient and the pinch velocity were determined as functions of the turbulence parameters and of the rmps amplitude @xmath0 in the framework of the test particle approach using a semi - analytical method , the dtm .",

    "the influence of the stochastic magnetic field generated by the rmps are rather complex , especially in the nonlinear regime that corresponds to trajectory trapping or eddying .",
    "one of the effects , which is well demonstrated and understood , is the attenuation of the modes determined by the increased diffusion , which leads to the decrease of @xmath23 .",
    "but other processes could have opposite effects on turbulence amplitude or they can even generate a different type of turbulence .    we have shown that the effects observed in experiments ( increased turbulent transport and generation of outward pinch ) occur even when the turbulence is not modified by the rmps . a direct influence of the rmps on transport is produced through a decorrelation mechanism .",
    "the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the amplitude of the rmps is nonlinear ( figure 2 ) .",
    "a smooth threshold exists  at small  @xmath1  it is determined by the condition that the characteristic time of the rmp decorrelation that is a decreasing function on @xmath0  should be smaller than the parallel decorrelation time . at larger @xmath86  the increase of the transport",
    "coefficients appear in both quasilinear and nonlinear regimes , with stronger effect in the first case .",
    "the increase is limited , and , after a maximum , the transport enters into a decaying regime .",
    "the maximum is very large in the nonlinear regime ( @xmath254 times larger than in the absence of the rmps )  and it appears at very large amplitudes ( @xmath255 in the quasilinear regime , the the maximum is much smaller ( by a factor five in the example in figure 2 ) and the rmp amplitude at the maximum is of the order @xmath256 both @xmath224 and @xmath257 decrease as the turbulence amplitude decreases .",
    "these results are in agreement with the experiments , which correspond to values of the rmp amplitude @xmath185 and lead to increases of the diffusion coefficients of the order @xmath258 these values of @xmath0  are close to the smooth threshold where similar variation of @xmath213 can be seen in figure 2 . according to our model , the results of the present experiments",
    "can not be extrapolated to iter conditions .",
    "a much faster increase with @xmath0  occurs at larger @xmath1 we have found a large difference between the nonlinear and the quasilinear transport at @xmath259 which corresponds to the rmps of the the order of @xmath260 in iter plasmas .",
    "the confirmation of the transition of the itg transport from the bohm to the gyro - bohm regime and demonstration that the gyro - bohm transport is of quasilinear type are very important in this context .",
    "we have also analyzed the effect of the rmps on the turbulent pinch velocity .",
    "we have shown that at large correlation times , the negative ( inward ) drift ( dashed curve in figure 3 ) is reduced by the rmps , then they generate a positive ( outward ) drift that is maximum for @xmath261 at larger @xmath0 the average velocity decreases and becomes again negative , which correspond to the prediction of an inward pinch in iter conditions , but with small values of the peaking .",
