    "moreover , as mentioned in @xcite , @xmath28 can be also derived by applying the lifting procedure @xcite to the following homogeneous reformulation of ( qps ) : @xmath29    a natural extension of ( qpl1(q ) ) is @xmath30 it is a relaxation of the sparse principal component analysis ( spca ) problem @xcite obtained by replacing the original constraint @xmath31 with ( [ l1:1 ] ) due to the following fact : @xmath32 a well - known sdp relaxation for ( qpl2l1(q ) ) is due to daspremont et al .",
