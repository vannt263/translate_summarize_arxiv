    "experimental data on inclusive @xmath4 meson semileptonic decays can in principle provide a very precise method to determine the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing parameter @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a crucial theoretical input is the hadronic matrix element needed to express the measured semileptonic width in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) @xcite is a qcd - based approach to inclusive processes that casts perturbative and non - perturbative corrections to the partonic width as power series expansions .",
    "an underlying assumption of this approach is quark - hadron duality .",
    "it is important to quantify the uncertainties induced by the neglected higher order terms in the non - perturbative expansion , as well as the uncertainty introduced by possible duality violations , in order to achieve a full understanding of the theoretical errors and be able to ascertain the true uncertainty on @xmath12 .",
    "the only strategy proposed so far to gather further insight is to measure several quantities predicted in this framework .",
    "a precise measurement of the lepton spectrum is an important element of this program and is the key result presented in this paper .",
    "the theoretical expression for the inclusive semileptonic width for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) through @xmath20 in the non - perturbative expansion and @xmath21 in the perturbative one is given by @xcite _ sl & = & 0.3689 , [ vcbf ] where @xmath22 is the one - loop qcd beta function and @xmath23 is the number of relevant flavors and the form factors @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the parameters of the @xmath10 terms in the non - perturbative expansion .",
    "these @xmath10 form factors are expected , from dimensional arguments , to be of the order @xmath30 , and thus they are generally assumed to be @xmath31 gev@xmath32 .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 is expected to be positive from the vacuum - saturation approximation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as gremm and kapustin have noted @xcite , the @xmath34-@xmath4 and @xmath35-@xmath36 mass splittings impose the constraint @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the beauty and charm quark masses , respectively ; @xmath40^{(3/\\beta_0)}$ ] and @xmath41 represents the vector - pseudoscalar meson splitting in the beauty ( charm ) sector .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 @xcite is related to the expectation value of the operator corresponding to the kinetic energy of the @xmath14 quark inside the @xmath4 meson : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the 4-velocity of the heavy hadron and @xmath45 is the quark field in the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 @xcite is the expectation value of the leading chromomagnetic operator that breaks the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "it is formally defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the heavy quark field and @xmath49 is the @xmath4 meson state . the value of @xmath50 is determined from the @xmath51 mass difference to be @xmath52 gev@xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 is related to the @xmath14-quark pole mass @xmath38 @xcite through the expression @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the spin - averaged @xmath56 mass ( @xmath57 gev/@xmath16 ) .",
    "a similar relationship holds between the @xmath3-quark mass @xmath39 and the spin - averaged charm meson mass ( @xmath58 gev/@xmath16 ) .",
    "the shape of the lepton momentum spectrum in @xmath17 decays can be used to measure the hqe parameters @xmath42 and @xmath53 , through its energy moments , which are also predicted in the heavy quark expansion .",
    "we choose to study truncated moments of the lepton spectrum , with a momentum cut of @xmath59 gev/@xmath3 in the @xmath4 meson rest frame .",
    "this choice decreases the sensitivity of our measurement to the secondary leptons from the cascade decays ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we extract the hqe parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 from measurements of two moments originally suggested by gremm _",
    "_ : is first introduced as r@xmath63 . ]",
    "@xmath64    @xmath65    the theoretical expressions for these moments r@xmath66 @xcite are evaluated by integrating the dominant @xmath67 component of the lepton spectrum .",
    "in addition , the small contribution coming from charmless semileptonic decays @xmath68 is included by adding the contribution from @xmath69 , scaled by @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we determine these two moments from the measured lepton spectrum in @xmath71 and insert them in the theoretical expressions to extract the two parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we have previously published experimental determinations of @xmath73 and @xmath62 obtained by studying the @xmath74 spectrum in @xmath75 @xcite and the first moment of the mass @xmath76 of the hadronic system recoiling against the @xmath77 pair in @xmath78 decays  @xcite .",
    "we compare our results to these measurements .    in recent years , increasing attention has been focused on `` short - range masses , '' preferred by some authors as they are not affected by renormalon ambiguities @xcite .",
    "in particular , the so - called 1s @xmath14-quark mass , , defined as one half of the energy of the 1s @xmath79 state calculated in perturbation theory , has been extracted from @xmath80(1s ) resonance data @xcite .",
    "the mass  has been shown to have remarkably well - behaved perturbative relations to other physical quantities such as the hadronic matrix element governing the @xmath81 semileptonic width @xcite . using the formalism developed by bauer and trott @xcite , we have used the spectral moments @xmath82 and @xmath83 to determine .",
    "these authors also explore different lepton energy moments , by varying the exponent of the energy in the integrands and the lower limits of integration .",
    "in particular , they identify several moments that provide constraints for  and @xmath72 that are less sensitive to higher order terms in the non - perturbative expansion .",
    "we study four such moments defined as    @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    the values of @xmath73 and @xmath62 determined with the latter set of constraints have different relative weights of the experimental and theoretical uncertainties and thus provide complementary information .    finally , bauer and trott identify moments that are insensitive to  and @xmath72 .",
    "they suggest that a comparison between theoretical evaluations of these `` duality moments '' and their experimental values may provide useful constraints on possible quark - hadron duality violations in semileptonic processes .",
    "we report our measurement of two such  duality moments \" , defined as @xmath88 and @xmath89 this measurement , together with new emerging experimental information @xcite , may eventually lead to a more complete assessment of our present understanding of inclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "the data sample used in this study was collected with the cleo ii detector @xcite at the cesr   collider .",
    "it consists of an integrated luminosity of 3.14 fb@xmath90 at the @xmath80(4s ) energy , corresponding to a sample of @xmath91 @xmath92 events .",
    "the continuum background is studied with a sample of @xmath93 fb@xmath90 collected at an energy about @xmath94 mev below the resonance .",
    "we measure the momentum spectrum of electrons and muons with a minimum momentum of 1.5 gev/@xmath3 in the @xmath4 meson center - of - mass frame .",
    "this momentum requirement ensures good efficiency and background rejection for both lepton species , thereby allowing us to check systematic effects with the @xmath95 ratio .",
    "for muons we have adequate efficiency and background rejection only above @xmath96 1.3 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "in addition , in this range the inclusive spectra are dominated by the direct @xmath97 semileptonic decay , with only a small contamination by secondary leptons produced in the decay chain @xmath98 .",
    "electrons are identified with a likelihood method that includes several discriminating variables , most importantly the ratio @xmath99 of the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter to the reconstructed momentum , and the specific ionization in the central drift chamber .",
    "muon candidates are required to penetrate at least five nuclear interaction lengths of absorber material .",
    "we use the central part of the detector ( @xmath100 for electrons and @xmath101 for muons ) .",
    "the overall efficiency is the product of three factors : the reconstruction efficiency , including event selection criteria and acceptance corrections ; the tracking efficiency ; and the @xmath102 or @xmath19 identification efficiency .",
    "the first two factors are estimated with monte carlo simulations and checked with data , whereas the lepton identification efficiencies are studied with data : radiative @xmath102-pair events for the @xmath102 efficiency and radiative bhabha electron tracks embedded in hadronic events for the @xmath19 efficiency .",
    "the @xmath19 identification efficiency is nearly constant in our momentum range and equal to @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath102 momentum threshold is near our low momentum cut , and the efficiency rises to a plateau of about 95% above 2.0 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "the distortion in momentum induced by radiation emitted in the detector and other instrumental effects is corrected for by using the same monte carlo samples used in the efficiency correction .",
    "figure [ totelspec ] shows the raw yields for electrons ( top ) and muons ( bottom ) from the @xmath80(4s ) sample and the continuum background .",
    "the latter is estimated from scaled off - resonance data .",
    "the scaling factor for the continuum sample is determined by the ratio of integrated luminosities and continuum cross sections and is @xmath104 .",
    "this scale factor has been determined independently using tracks with momenta higher than the kinematic limit for @xmath4-meson decay products . in all the cases",
    "no statistically significant lepton yield has been observed beyond the endpoint for @xmath4 decays , within errors .",
    "the study of these control samples is used to determine the systematic error on the continuum scale factor .",
    "the raw yields include hadrons misidentified as leptons ( fakes ) .",
    "this contribution is determined from data as follows .",
    "fake rates are determined from tagged samples : charged pions from @xmath105 , charged kaons from @xmath106 , and protons from @xmath107 . the momentum - dependent probability for misidentifying a hadron track as an electron or muon",
    "is then determined by weighting the pion , kaon , and proton probabilities according to particle abundances determined with @xmath108 monte carlo .",
    "the fake correction applied to the data is obtained by folding these fake probabilities with the measured spectra of hadronic tracks in @xmath108 events .",
    "we correct for several sources of real leptons .",
    "leptons from @xmath109 decays are vetoed by combining a candidate with another lepton of the same type and opposite sign and removing it if their invariant mass is within @xmath110 of the known @xmath109 mass .",
    "a correction is made for veto inefficiency .",
    "a similar procedure is applied to electrons and positrons coming from @xmath111 dalitz decays and from @xmath112 conversions .    finally , we subtract leptons coming from @xmath113 decays or the secondary decays @xmath114 and @xmath115 using monte carlo simulations",
    ". figures [ elbkgcntri ] and [ elsec ] show the individual estimated background contributions to our sample .",
    "note that all of the backgrounds are small compared to the signal .",
    "our goal is a precise determination of the shape of the lepton momentum spectrum , so corrections for the distortion introduced by electroweak radiative effects are important .",
    "we use the prescription developed by d.  atwood and w.  marciano @xcite .",
    "this procedure incorporates leading - log and short - distance loop corrections , and sums soft - virtual and real - photon corrections to all orders .",
    "it does not incorporate hard - photon bremsstrahlung , which mainly modifies the low energy portion of the electron spectrum , and is not used in our analysis .",
    "an independent method of studying qed radiative corrections in semileptonic decays , based on the simulation package photos @xcite , has been used to obtain an independent assessment of the corrections .",
    "the difference between the two methods is used to obtain the systematic error of this correction .",
    "finally , we use a monte carlo sample of @xmath116 events to derive a matrix to unfold the corrected spectra from the laboratory frame into the @xmath4-meson rest frame .",
    "( @xmath4 mesons produced at the @xmath117 by the cesr   collider typically have a momentum of @xmath118 300 mev/@xmath3 in the laboratory frame . ) our lower momentum limit of 1.35 gev/@xmath3 for the measurement of the lepton spectra ensures that end effects in the unfolding procedure do not introduce distortions into the determination of the spectral moments .",
    "the measured spectrum includes leptons from @xmath119 and @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ bothspcatw ] shows the resulting electron and muon spectra .",
    "while the curves shown combine both signs of lepton charges , we have also studied positive and negative leptons separately and found good agreement between them .",
    "the @xmath68 tail beyond the endpoint of charmed semileptonic decay is not shown in fig .  [ bothspcatw ] but is unfolded and added separately to the measured moments .",
    "our first step is the determination of the truncated moments r@xmath120 and r@xmath121 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) and   ( [ r1 ] ) , respectively . using the measured spectra",
    ", we evaluate the relevant integrals and obtain the results shown in table  [ rmom ] , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic in each quoted number .",
    "table [ err : r01 ] summarizes our studies of several sources of systematic uncertainty and their effect on the moments @xmath82 and @xmath83 . the dominant uncertainty for both lepton species is related to particle identification efficiency .",
    "as the moments are ratios of measured quantities , the effects of several uncertainties , which are nearly independent of the lepton energy , cancel .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainties are 0.28% for r@xmath122 and 0.06% for r@xmath123 for the  sample , and 0.32% and 0.06% for the  sample . these are comparable to the statistical uncertainties .",
