    "radio spectrum is a limited and precious natural resource , which , traditionally , is licensed to users by regulatory authorities in a very rigid manner where in order to avoid interference , the licensed owner has an exclusive right to access the allocated frequency band @xcite .",
    "consequently , as the number of wireless communication systems and services grows , the availability of vacant spectrum becomes severely scarce .",
    "however , recent measurements by the federal communications commission reveal that many portions of spectrum are mostly under utilized or even unoccupied .",
    "this led to the idea of cognitive radio ( cr ) technology , originally introduced by j. mitola @xcite , which holds tremendous promise to dramatically improve the efficiency of spectral utilization .",
    "the key idea behind cr is that an unlicensed / secondary user ( su ) is allowed to communicate over the frequency band originally licensed to a primary user ( pu ) , as long as the transmission of su does not generate unfavorable impact on the operation of pu .",
    "effectively , three categories of cr network paradigms have been proposed : interweave , overlay , and underlay @xcite . in the underlay systems , which is the focus of this paper , the su can transmit even when the pu is present , but",
    "the transmitted power of su should be controlled properly so as to ensure that the resulting interference does not degrade the received signal quality of pu to an undesirable level @xcite by imposing the so called interference temperature @xcite constraints at pu ( average or peak interference power ( aip / pip ) constraint ) .",
    "this type of cr is also known as the spectrum sharing @xcite model .",
    "+ @xcite first studied the behavior of capacities of different awgn channels under received - power constraints ( aip ) at the pu receiver ( pu - rx ) , which showed that for point - to - point non - fading awgn channels , the capacity performance with transmit and received power constraints are very similar .",
    "the ergodic capacity of narrow band spectrum sharing model with one su and one or multiple pu under either aip or pip constraint at pu - rx in various fading environments was studied by @xcite , illustrating that in a fading environment , spectrum access opportunity for the su significantly increases compared to the awgn case . in @xcite , the authors studied optimum power allocation for three different capacity notions under both aip and pip constraints . @xcite designed optimal power transmission strategies for maximizing ergodic capacity and outage capacity under various combinations of secondary transmit power constraints and interference constraints .",
    "+ most of the above results assume perfect knowledge of full channel state information ( csi ) including the su - tx to pu - rx channels , which is hard to realize in practice .",
    "a few recent papers have emerged that address this concern by investigating capacity analysis with imperfect csi .",
    "the effect of imperfect channel estimation in the secondary to primary channels has been investigated in @xcite by considering the channel estimate as a noisy version of the true csi , and @xcite proposed a practical design paradigm for cognitive beamforming based on finite - rate cooperative feedback from the pu - rx to the su - tx .",
    "another recent work @xcite also considers imperfect csi for the su - tx to pu - rx channel in the form of noisy channel estimate and quantized channel information and investigates the effect of such imperfect csi on the capacity performance of the secondary user , while assuming that the su - tx has full knowledge of the su - tx to su - rx channel .",
    "finally , @xcite studies the issue of channel quantization for resource allocation via the framework of utility maximization in ofdma based cognitive radio networks , but does not investigate the joint channel partitioning and rate / power codebook design problem . indeed , the lack of a rigorous and systematic design methodology for quantized resource allocation algorithms in the context of cognitive radio networks forms the key motivation for our work . in this paper , we investigate an ergodic capacity optimization problem for the secondary user where quantized information about the vector channel space consisting of su - tx to su - rx channels and su - tx to pu - rx channels is available to the su - tx via a limited feedback channel without delay .",
    "we consider a wideband spectrum sharing system where one su shares @xmath0 different frequency bands with @xmath0 pu s , each pu using a separate band .",
    "we address the problem of ergodic capacity maximization of the secondary user subject to an average sum ( across the bands ) transmit power constraint on the secondary user and individual average interference constraints on the primary users , using quantized channel information . to this end",
    ", we assume the availability of an entity called a band manager ( or a cr service provider ) who has access to the full csi including all secondary - to - secondary and secondary - to - primary channels .",
    "it designs ( offline ) an optimal power codebook based on the statistical information ( channel distributions ) of the channels and in real - time , feeds back the index of the codebook to the secondary transmitter for every channel realization , via a limited feedback link .",
    "the secondary transmitter then uses the corresponding power code vector for its transmission .",
    "+ we make the following key contributions : ( 1 ) we first present , very briefly , a systematic algorithm for optimal power allocation with full channel side information ( csi ) at the secondary transmitter .",
    "this is a minor extension of the results in @xcite to the multiple pu case .",
    "however , the novelty lies in exactly characterizing the optimal power allocation policy based on the relationship between the available total average su transmit power and the individual average interference levels at the pu receivers .",
    "( 2 ) next , we present a modified generalized lloyd s type algorithm ( gla ) for designing the optimal power codebook using quantized channel information . for easier exposition , we focus on the narrowband case first and present the quantized power allocation algorithm , where we prove that the modified gla based power codebook design algorithm is globally convergent and empirically consistent .",
    "we provide a number of useful and interesting properties of the quantized powers .",
    "then we present a complete description of the optimal power codebook design algorithm for the wideband spectrum sharing case under the average transmit power and average interference constraints .",
    "we believe this paper is the first to provide a systematic quantized power allocation algorithm with limited feedback for the spectrum sharing scenario in cognitive radio .",
    "( 3 ) although an offline algorithm , gla based quantizer designs usually require a large number of training samples and can be computationally expensive .",
    "we therefore design an approximate quantized power allocation algorithm based on the derived properties of the power codebook , which is computationally much faster .",
    "( 4 ) we then generalize the modified gla based algorithm for quantized power allocation algorithm to the case where the limited feedback channel is noisy but memoryless .",
    "( 5 ) we present a comprehensive set of numerical results that illustrate ( i ) how the modified gla - based power codebook can achieve a secondary ergodic capacity with only 3 - 4 bits of feedback , that is very close to the capacity with full csi , ( ii ) how the performance of the approximate quantized power allocation algorithm is almost indistinguishable from that of the gla - based algorithm with @xmath1 bits of feedback and ( ii ) how the performance of the quantized power allocation degrades when the noisy feedback channel error probability increases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ model ] presents the system model and assumptions about the spectrum sharing problem with limited feedback . in section [ fullcsi ]",
    ", we present the optimal power allocation policy when the secondary transmitter has full csi and discuss various special cases . in section [ gla ]",
    ", we present the modified gla based quantized power codebook design algorithms for the narrowband case followed by the wideband case .",
    "we present results on global convergence and empirical consistency of the gla based algorithms and some prove some useful properties of the quantized power code vectors .",
    "these properties are then used to design an approximate quantized power allocation algorithm suitable for moderate to large number of feedback bits that has a much faster convergence time compared to its gla counterpart . in section [ noisyfeedback ] , we provide a modified gla based power codebook design algorithm for a noisy limited feedback channel model .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ sec : simul ] and finally , concluding remarks and possible extensions are presented in section [ conclu ] .",
    "all proofs are relegated to the appendix unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "in the next section , we present the optimal power allocation results assuming that full channel state information ( csi ) is available at the su - tx ( i.e , @xmath26 ) , followed by the case of quantized channel information ( or limited feedback ) in section iv , where @xmath27 represents a deterministic index mapping scheme , such that @xmath28 when the instantaneous channel gains @xmath29 belong to a carefully constructed partition @xmath30 of the channel space @xmath31 .",
    "in this section , we assume that su - tx has perfect knowledge of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( full csi at the transmitter ) , that is , @xmath26 . it is easy to verify that the problem given in ( [ q1 ] ) is a convex optimization problem . by applying the necessary and sufficient karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions for optimality",
    ", the optimal power allocation can be easily shown to be    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the nonnegative lagrange multipliers associated with the atp constraint and the aip constraint of @xmath37 respectively , and @xmath38 .",
    "this solution is clearly a minor extension of the narrowband result in @xcite .",
    "however , in the wideband case ( @xmath39 ) , it should be noted that determining the optimal power allocation scheme involves obtaining the optimal values of the @xmath40 lagrange multipliers . since all the constraints in problem ( [ q1 ] )",

    "if @xmath51 and both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are independent and identically distributed , the optimal power allocation policy is to assign equal power to each su link , which is identical to the power allocation policy for the @xmath17 case .    appealing to the convexity of problem ( [ q1 ] ) , one can show that in theorem [ t1 ] , one of the cases must hold , and the corresponding power allocation scheme must be the global optimal solution for the original problem ( [ q1 ] ) .",
    "an algorithm can be then easily designed to obtain @xmath52 , and the associated non - zero lagrange multipliers can be obtained by solving the kkt optimality conditions numerically ( e.g , via a bisection search ) .",
    "the assumption of full csi at the su - tx ( especially that of @xmath32 ) is usually unrealistic in practical systems . in this section , we are therefore interested in designing power allocation schemes based on quantized ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) information acquired via a no - delay and error - free feedback link with limited rate . here",

    "@xcite ) who can obtain perfect information on @xmath33 from su - rx or su base stations and perfect information on @xmath32 from pu base stations , presumably over a wired link , and then forward some appropriately quantized csi to su - tx ( and su - rx for decoding purposes ) through the feedback link .",
    "more specifically , given b bits of feedback , a power codebook @xmath53@xmath54 ( where @xmath55 ) of cardinality @xmath56 , is designed off line purely on the basis of the statistics of @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",

    ". gla is usually initialized with a random choice of codebook , and then the above two conditions are iterated until some pre - specified convergence criterion is met .",
    "the same procedure is used here for designing an optimal quantizer @xmath61 , but the design criterion for our case is minimizing the difference between the capacity with perfect csi and the capacity with quantized power allocation under the given constraints .",

    "these two steps are repeated until the resulting ergodic capacity converges within a prespecified accuracy .",
    "one needs to note that gla can not in general guarantee global optimality , since the two optimality conditions ( nnc and cc ) mentioned above are just necessary conditions @xcite .",

    "the percentage capacity loss is approximately @xmath230 and @xmath231 respectively , and for both @xmath223 db and @xmath224 db cases , only 3 bits feedback can result in secondary ergodic capacity very close to that with full csi .",
    "this is very encouraging since only a small number of bits of feedback are required to achieve close performance to the full csi case .",
    "it can be also seen that the capacity performance with large aip threshold ( @xmath224 db ) outperform the ones with low aip threshold ( @xmath223 db ) , as expected .",
    "a similar behaviour can be also observed in fig .",

    "<S> we consider a wideband spectrum sharing system where a secondary user can share a number of orthogonal frequency bands where each band is licensed to an individual primary user . </S>",
    "<S> we address the problem of optimum secondary transmit power allocation for its ergodic capacity maximization subject to an average sum ( across the bands ) transmit power constraint and individual average interference constraints on the primary users . </S>",
    "<S> the major contribution of our work lies in considering quantized channel state information ( csi)(for the vector channel space consisting of all secondary - to - secondary and secondary - to - primary channels ) at the secondary transmitter as opposed to the prevalent assumption of full csi in most existing work . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that a band manager or a cognitive radio service provider has access to the full csi information from the secondary and primary receivers and designs ( offline ) an optimal power codebook based on the statistical information ( channel distributions ) of the channels and feeds back the index of the codebook to the secondary transmitter for every channel realization in real - time , via a delay - free noiseless limited feedback channel . </S>",
    "<S> a modified generalized lloyds - type algorithm ( gla ) is designed for deriving the optimal power codebook , which is proved to be globally convergent and empirically consistent . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate quantized power allocation ( aqpa ) algorithm is also presented , that performs very close to its gla based counterpart for large number of feedback bits and is significantly faster . </S>",
    "<S> we also present an extension of the modified gla based quantized power codebook design algorithm for the case when the feedback channel is noisy . </S>",
    "<S> numerical studies illustrate that with only 3 - 4 bits of feedback , the modified gla based algorithms provide secondary ergodic capacity very close to that achieved by full csi and with only as little as 4 bits of feedback , aqpa provides a comparable performance , thus making it an attractive choice for practical implementation . </S>"
