    "the strong electron correlation in high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) is able to drive an electronic nematic phase @xcite , which preserves translational symmetry but breaks rotational symmetry . in the past decade , there have been a number of experimental signatures pointing to the presence of nematic ordering transition in some htscs @xcite .",
    "on the basis of these experiments , a zero - temperature nematic quantum critical point ( qcp ) is supposed to exist at certain doping concentration @xmath3 in the superconducting ( sc ) dome @xcite . generally , the nematic order has two impacts on the sc state .",
    "first , it competes with the sc order @xcite .",
    "second , the nematic order parameter couples to the gapless nodal quasiparticles ( qps ) , which are believed to be the most important fermionic excitations in unconventional superconductors with @xmath4 energy gap .",
    "the latter coupling is singular at the nematic qcp @xmath3 , and has stimulated considerable theoretical efforts @xcite .",
    "a recent renormalization group analysis @xcite showed that it leads to a novel fixed point at which the ratio between gap velocity @xmath5 and fermi velocity @xmath6 of nodal qps flows to zero , @xmath7 .",
    "although a zero - temperature nematic qcp is expected to exist somewhere in the sc dome @xcite , shown schematically in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) , its precise position , and even its very existence , has not been unambiguously confirmed by experiments so far .",
    "it is therefore always interesting to seek evidence which can help convincingly confirm or disconfirm the existence of such point . in this paper",

    "htscs are known to be doped mott insulators , so their superfluid density is much smaller than that of conventional metal superconductors . at @xmath0 , the superfluid density in underdoping region depends @xcite linearly on doping @xmath8 as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the lattice spacing . at finite @xmath11 ,",

    "this argument is certainly oversimplified since the above expression of @xmath2 is obtained in the non - interacting limit .",
    "however , this qualitative analysis does indicate the importance of the critical nematic fluctuations , and indeed motivates us to perform a quantitative computation of the renormalized @xmath18 and @xmath2 after taking into account the nematic fluctuations .",
    "the nematic order affects @xmath18 in two ways . on the one hand , since the nematic order competes with the sc order , it reduces @xmath19 .",

    "a crucial problem is how to assess the roles played by nodal and antinodal qps in the destruction of sc condensate . as revealed clearly by extensive experiments @xcite , a pseudogap phase exists above @xmath2 .",
    "the pseudogap turns out to have the same @xmath94-wave symmetry as the sc gap @xcite , which implies the antinodal qps remain gapped as temperature increases across @xmath2 .",

    "lee and wen further assume that the nodal qps do not carry superflow @xcite , so the fermion spectrum is shifted by the vector potential to @xmath95 , where the qps energy is linearized as @xmath96 near nodes @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the normal state velocity .",

    "the fermi liquid ( fl ) corrections to these results were also investigated @xcite .",
    "an important fact is that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 contain the velocity ratio @xmath108 , so these two quantities are expected to be significantly affected by the critical nematic fluctuation which can cause a nontrivial renormalization of the velocity ratio .",
    "the above approach of computing @xmath2 is applicable when the nodal qps are well defined . at the nematic qcp @xmath3 ,",
    "the critical fluctuation of nematic order couples strongly to gapless nodal qps and may lead to breakdown of fl behavior . as a consequence , the nodal qps might no longer be well defined qps . in a strict sense , the validity of the simple @xmath94-wave bcs theory @xcite and its fl - interaction generalizations @xcite are both doubtful . in order to proceed , here we assume that the basic approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is still valid after the free energy of qps receives a singular correction due to nematic fluctuation .",

    "it is clear that both @xmath124 and @xmath125 vanish as @xmath126 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath124 approaches zero much more slowly than @xmath125 does .",
    "therefore , the velocity ratio vanishes at the lowest energy , @xmath127 , which recovers the extreme velocity anisotropy @xcite .",

    "( a ) : @xmath142 ; ( b ) : @xmath143.,width=307 ]    clearly , the extent to which @xmath1 and @xmath2 are suppressed by the nematic order depends on a number of parameters , such as @xmath25 , @xmath23 , and @xmath91 .",
    "it is helpful to make more quantitative analysis .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath25 as well as @xmath144 have already been chosen .",
    "the bare velocity ratio is still fixed at @xmath129 .",
    "[ fig : rho0rg](b ) shows that @xmath2 is roughly suppressed by @xmath145 when @xmath142 , and by @xmath146 when @xmath147 .",
    "the drop of @xmath18 can be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "an important implication of fig .",
    "( [ fig : rhot ] ) is that @xmath18 is more strongly reduced at higher temperatures .",
    "experimentally , the suppression of @xmath2 can be tested by measuring resistivity and meissner effect , and the suppression of superfluid density may be probed by measuring london penetration length @xmath148 , preferably using microwave techniques @xcite based on the relationship @xmath149 .",
    "the strong suppression effects rely on the divergence of correlation length @xmath150 of the nematic field @xmath22 at the qcp @xmath3 . as one moves away from the point @xmath3 , the strong suppression of superfluid density and @xmath2",
    "will be rapidly diminished .",
    "in fact , once correlation length @xmath150 becomes finite , the interaction between nematic fluctuation and nodal qps is no longer singular .",
    "consequently , the self - energy of nodal qps , @xmath151 , does not display logarithmic behavior , which indicates that the fermion velocities only receive unimportant renormalizations . in this case ,",
    "the density of normal qps is not significantly modified by the competing nematic order , since the velocity ratio does not depart far from its bare value .",
    "the influence of nemtic order on @xmath90 is also weakened . for @xmath152 ,",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath22 is rather weak and does not change @xmath90 much if @xmath23 is not very large . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath22 is gapped and also leads to much smaller change of @xmath90 compared with what happens at nematic qcp @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 curve generally follows the uemura plot in the whole underdoped region , but deviates from the linear behavior in the close vicinity of @xmath3 .",
    "since the suppression of superconductivity is most pronounced at @xmath3 , it may help to find the position of the predicted nematic qcp if such a point really exists .",
    "in summary , we have considered the effects of nematic fluctuation on superfluid density and critical temperature @xmath2 in the vicinity of nematic qcp in the contexts of some htscs .",
    "on one hand , the critical fluctuation of nematic order parameter reduces zero-@xmath11 superfluid density as a result of ordering competition .",
    "on the other hand , it couples strongly to the gapless nodal qps and excites more normal qps out of the sc condensate by triggering an extreme fermion velocity anisotropy .",
    "both of these two effects combine to significantly suppress superconductivity .",
    "therefore , we have predicted a dip shape reduction of @xmath2 at nematic qcp @xmath3 , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the dip shape of @xmath2 reminds us of @xmath154 anomaly @xcite , which refers to an anomalous suppression of superconductivity at doping @xmath155 . a sudden drop of @xmath90",
    "was also observed @xcite in la@xmath156sr@xmath157cuo@xmath158 ( lsco ) at @xmath155 .",
    "it appears that @xmath1 and @xmath2 near the nematic qcp bear some similarity to the basic features of these experiments .",
    "however , we refrain from identifying the @xmath154 doping as the anticipated nematic qcp for several reasons : i ) @xmath154 anomaly is usually attributed to the formation of static stripe order @xcite ; ii ) it is not clear why nematic qcp exists precisely at @xmath159 , not elsewhere ; iii ) low-@xmath11 dc thermal conductivity @xmath160 was predicted to be enhanced at nematic qcp @xcite , whereas an early transport measurement found a drop of @xmath160 in lsco at @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "recently the critical nematic fluctuations are shown to induce unusual behaviors in several quantities , such as qps spectral function @xcite , specific heat @xcite , nuclear relaxation rate @xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite , and qp interference @xcite .",
    "normally , a single observation alone is not able to uniquely fix the nematic qcp .",
    "should all or most of these predictions , including the suppression of superconductivity , be observed , the nematic qcp might be determined .",
    "however , the absence of a sharp nematic qcp does not necessarily mean the absence of nematic phase , since the sharp qcp may be rounded by disorders and become a crossover @xcite . in case",
    "this smearing occurs , many of the anomalous critical behaviors are weakened , or even destroyed , and the nematic phase most possibly shows its existence in the @xmath161 regime .    in the calculations presented in this paper",
    ", we have assumed that the sc order parameter @xmath21 is a classical field and neglected its quantum fluctuation .",
    "this assumption is expected to be a good one if the nematic qcp @xmath3 is deep inside the sc dome , namely @xmath3 is not close to the sc critical point @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath3 is close to @xmath30 , the quantum fluctuation of sc order @xmath21 may become very important and a fully quantum - mechanical treatment will be necessary .",
