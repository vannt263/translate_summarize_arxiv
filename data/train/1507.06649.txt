    "<S> [ fig : fid ] ( a ) , since the projection of @xmath8 on the @xmath38 subspace is zero , the fidelity coincides with the survival probability , @xmath111 , which , counterintuitively , decays slower as the system size increases . </S>",

    "<S> we note that @xmath106 gives the time scale over which the shielding effect persists . in finite systems , shielding is effective for a finite time that can , however , be exceedingly long , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> conclusions. _ we revealed a generic effect of long - range interacting systems : _ cooperative shielding_. it refers to invariant subspaces that emerge as the system size increases . </S>",

    "<S> the analysis and control of nonequilibrium dynamics can never be detached from the initial state considered . for exactly the same hamiltonian with long - range interaction , </S>",
    "<S> an initial state with components in the various subspaces induced by that interaction leads to a nonlocal propagation of perturbation , as demonstrated experimentally with ion traps  @xcite , while an initial state belonging to a single subspace is unaffected by the long - range interaction , as verified here . </S>",
