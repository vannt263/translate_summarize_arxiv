    "there are two familiar ways of parametrizing the complex order parameter field @xmath4 in a @xmath0-symmetric theory .",

    "we focus on the low temperature regime well below the bkt - temperature , where vortices play no role . using a truncation of the effective action at quartic order in the field , with a cartesian decomposition in longitudinal and transverse components , we obtain an analytic understanding of the behavior of the flow .",
    "the expected fixed point with an algebraic decay of order parameter correlations is recovered if longitudinal fluctuations are discarded",

    "this is clearly at odds with the absence of any singular corrections to the phase stiffness in the density - phase representation .",

    "thereby , all power laws obtained from our truncated flow equations were confirmed . in particular , the longitudinal mass indeed scales to zero , with an exponent @xmath146 . however , there is no flow of the stiffness in the density - phase representation .",
    "the logarithmic flow of the stiffness obtained in the cartesian decomposition of the order parameter field must therefore be canceled by higher order terms not included in our truncation .",
    "indeed , we already showed that the leading contributions to the stiffness flow ( of order @xmath23 ) found in the work by grter and wetterich @xcite are canceled by including a density gradient term , so that the flow in our truncation arises only at order @xmath198 .",
    "a comparison to the low temperature expansion of the non - linear sigma model @xcite shows that the vanishing beta - function for the coupling in this model is thus reproduced to one - loop order in the truncation used by grter and wetterich , and to two - loop order in our truncation .",
    "the cancellation of terms of order @xmath198 requires a complete account of all three - loop contributions in the non - linear sigma model .",
