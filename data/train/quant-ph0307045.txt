    "entanglement is a property of quantum systems to exhibit correlations that can not be accounted for classically .",
    "entangled states of collective quantum systems , which are states that can not be factorized into product states of the subsystems , are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics .",
    "a number of methods for creating entanglement have been proposed involving trapped and cooled ions or neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is generation of entangled states in two - atom systems , since they can represent two qubits , the building blocks of the quantum gates that are essential to implement quantum protocols in quantum information processing .",
    "it has been shown that entangled states in a two - atom system can be created by a continuous driving of the atoms with a coherent or chaotic thermal field  @xcite , or by a pulse excitation followed by a continuous observation of radiative decay  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effect of spontaneous emission on initially prepared entangled state has also been discussed  @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , have been limited to the small sample ( dicke ) model  @xcite or the situation involving noninteracting atoms strongly coupled to a cavity mode .",
    "the difficulty of the dicke model is that it does not include the dipole - dipole interaction among the atoms and does not correspond to realistic experimental situations of atoms located ( trapped ) at different positions .",
    "in fact , the model corresponds to a very specific geometrical configuration of the atoms confined to a volume much smaller compared with the atomic resonant wavelength ( the small - sample model ) .",
    "the present atom trapping and cooling techniques can trap two atoms at distances of order of a resonant wavelength  @xcite , which makes questionable the applicability of the dicke model to physical systems .",
    "recently , we have shown  @xcite that spontaneous emission from two spatially separated atoms can lead to a transient entanglement of initially unentangled atoms .",
    "this result contrasts the with the dicke model where spontaneous emission can not produce entanglement from initially unentangled atoms  @xcite .",
    "we have numerically calculated the evolution of the concurrence and discussed the role of the maximally entangled collective states of the two - atom system : the rapidly decaying symmetric state and the slowly decaying antisymmetric state of the two - atom system .    in this paper",
    "we extend our study of spontaneously induced transient entanglement in a system of two atoms separated by an arbitrary distance @xmath0 .",
    "we find analytical results for the two calculable measures of entanglement _ concurrence _ and _ negativity _ establishing the relation between the two .",
    "our solutions are valid for a broad class of initial conditions including mixed states .",
    "it is shown that when the dipole - dipole interaction becomes larger than the atomic decay rate then the entanglement exhibits oscillatory behaviour , oscillating with twice the frequency describing the dipole - dipole interaction , which is the frequency separation between the symmetric and antisymmetric states of the two - atom system .",
    "remarkable amounts of entanglement can be obtained at the maxima of the oscillations . for times",
    "longer that the decay rate of the superradiant symmetric state , when the population of the symmetric state is negligible , the oscillations disappear and the entanglement remaining in the system is related to the population of the slowly decaying antisymmetric state .",
    "to assess how much entanglement is stored in a given quantum system it is essential to have appropriate measures of entanglement .",
    "a number of measures have been proposed , which include entanglement of formation  @xcite , entanglement of distillation  @xcite , relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite and negativity  @xcite . for pure states ,",
    "the bell states represent maximally entangled states , but for mixed states represented by a density matrix there are some difficulties with ordering the states according to various entanglement measures ; different entanglement measures can give different orderings of pairs of mixed states and there is a problem of the definition of the maximally entangled mixed state  @xcite .",
    "here we use two entanglement measures , _",
    "i.e. _ , concurrence and negativity to describe the amount of entanglement created in a two - atom system during spontaneous emission .",
    "the concurrence introduced by wootters  @xcite is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath3 with @xmath4 given by @xmath5 @xmath6 is the pauli matrix , and @xmath7 is the density matrix representing the quantum state .",
    "the range of concurrence is from 0 to 1 . for unentangled atoms",
    "@xmath8 whereas @xmath9 for the maximally entangled atoms .    another measure of entanglement we use here is the negativity , which is based on the peres - horodecki  @xcite criterion for entanglement and is defined by the formula @xmath10 where the sum is taken over the negative eigenvalues @xmath11 of the partial transposition of the density matrix @xmath7 of the system .",
    "the partial transposition means transposition with respect to the one atom only . for pure states , like in the case of concurrence ,",
    "@xmath12 for maximally entangled state and @xmath13 for unentangled atoms .",
    "the two entanglement measures , _",
    "i.e. _ , concurrence and negativity , give the same criteria for entanglement , but generally they give different values for a degree of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "we will give analytical expressions for both of them for the entanglement produced in spontaneous emission .",
    "introducing the computational basis for the two - atom system as product states of the individual atoms , as follows @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 ) are the ground and excited states of the individual atoms , we can define the density matrix of the two - atom system as a @xmath17 matrix .",
    "we assume that the density matrix of the system has the block form @xmath18{cccc } \\rho_{11}&\\rho_{12}&0&0\\\\ \\rho_{21}&\\rho_{22}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\rho_{33}&\\rho_{34}\\\\ 0&0&\\rho_{43}&\\rho_{44 }      \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] with the condition @xmath19 .",
    "we will show that , if the atoms initially start from a state described by the density matrix of the form  ( [ eq : rho ] ) , the evolution does not destroy this form in the sense that the blocks of zeros remain untouched .",
    "the other matrix elements evolve in time , and we find explicitly their time dependence .",
    "the matrix @xmath4 , needed for calculation of the concurrence , has the form @xmath20{cccc } \\rho_{22}&\\rho_{12}&0&0\\\\ \\rho_{21}&\\rho_{11}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\rho_{44}&\\rho_{34}\\\\ 0&0&\\rho_{43}&\\rho_{33 }      \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] and the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath21 given by  ( [ eq : r ] ) are the following @xmath22 depending on the particular values of the matrix elements there are two possibilities for the largest eigenvalue , either the second term or the fourth term in  ( [ eq : roots ] ) .",
    "the concurrence is thus given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 and we have two alternative expressions for the concurrence depending on which of them is positive .    for calculation of the negativity",
    "we need the partially transposed density matrix .",
    "the transposition with respect to the indices of the first atom gives the matrix @xmath25{cccc } \\rho_{11}&\\rho_{43}&0&0\\\\ \\rho_{34}&\\rho_{22}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&\\rho_{33}&\\rho_{21}\\\\ 0&0&\\rho_{12}&\\rho_{44 }      \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] which has the eigenvalues @xmath26 there are two candidates for being negative among the roots  ( [ eq : eigtransp ] ) , however , they can not be negative simultaneously because the inequality @xmath27 implies that @xmath28 , and vice versa .",
    "it is also easy to find the two alternative values for the concurrence  ( [ eq : concurrence1 ] ) inside the square roots .",
    "so , the negativity defined by  ( [ eq : negativity ] ) has also two alternative forms @xmath29 where the appropriate expression from  ( [ eq : altconc ] ) is to be substituted to the two alternative terms in  ( [ eq : negativity1_2 ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , which are always nonnegative , represent two alternative expressions associated with corresponding expressions @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the concurrence  ( [ eq : concurrence1 ] ) , and they have the following form @xmath34 for pure states @xmath35 and @xmath36 are equal to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , and in this case the negativity is equal to the concurrence .",
    "the equality  ( [ eq : negativity1_2 ] ) establishes the relation between the negativity and the concurrence for the system described by the density matrix of the form  ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "it is evident that both quantities give the same criterion for entanglement , that is , positive value of @xmath37 implies positive value of @xmath38 , but the degree of entanglement indicated by the two quantities can be quite different .",
    "it is also clear from  ( [ eq : negativity1_2 ] ) that the product @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) can as a whole serve as a measure of entanglement : it is zero if @xmath41 , and it is unity for maximally entangled pure state , but for mixed states it gives yet another value for the degree of entanglement .",
    "it is interesting to express the results for concurrence and negativity in the bell basis which is defined as follows @xmath42 the transformation of the density matrix @xmath7 given by  ( [ eq : rho ] ) from the original basis  ( [ eq : basis ] ) to the bell basis  ( [ bellbasis ] ) is performed with the transformation matrix @xmath43{rrrr } 1&1&0&0\\\\ -1&1&0&0\\\\ 0&0&1&1\\\\ 0&0&-1&1\\\\ \\end{array}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to the new density matrix @xmath44 which has the same block form as  ( [ eq : rho ] ) but the new matrix elements have primed indices ( @xmath45 ) .",
