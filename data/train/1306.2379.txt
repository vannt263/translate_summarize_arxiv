    "non - abelian topological phases of matter support quasiparticle excitations with exotic exchange properties that may be described by non - abelian braiding statistics  @xcite .",
    "these non - abelian anyonic quasiparticles possess a degenerate topological state space that is nonlocal . exchanging quasiparticles acts upon this space via ( possibly non - commuting ) multi - dimensional representations of the braid group .",
    "the nonlocality of the topological state space makes it essentially immune to local perturbations and the exchange transformations acting upon it exact .",
    "this gives non - abelian topological phases great potential for providing an intrinsically fault - tolerant platform for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "measurement of topological charge is an important primitive operation necessary for topological quantum information processing .",
    "this allows one to measure the topological state and hence provide readout of topologically encoded information .",
    "it can also be used to generate the anyonic braiding transformations without actually moving the computational quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "anyonic interferometry  @xcite is a particular form of topological charge measurement that has been proposed for topological systems .",
    "its ability to non - locally and non - demolitionally measure the collective anyonic charge of a group of ( non - abelian ) anyons , without decohering their internal state , makes it more powerful than standard local measurements of topological charge .",
    "in particular , anyonic interferometry can also be used to generate entangling gates  @xcite and change between different qubit encodings  @xcite .",
    "there have been many experimental proposals  @xcite to realize and utilize anyonic interferometers , as well as efforts to physically implement them  @xcite . despite the focus anyonic interferometry",
    "has received , there is still more to be learned about its potential capabilities .    in this paper , we propose and analyze a novel implementation of anyonic interferometry that we call `` twisted interferometry , '' which can provide capabilities that go beyond that of its standard _ untwisted _ counterpart .",
    "the basic idea of the twisted interferometer is to modify the design of an anyonic interferometer so that the probe anyons traveling in a given path through the interferometer will twist or braid around each other .",
    "the inspiration for twisted interferometry was a series of ideas  @xcite going back to the unpublished work of bravyi and kitaev for generating topologically protected operations , such as the @xmath2-gate , for a system of ising non - abelian anyons using the concept of dehn surgery on @xmath3-manifolds .",
    "indeed , the primary practical motivation for studying twisted interferometry is that it could be used with ising anyons to generate `` magic states , '' as we will demonstrate .",
    "this is significant because , if one only has the ability to perform braiding operations and untwisted anyonic interferometry measurements for ising anyons , then one can only generate the clifford group operations , which is not computationally universal and , in fact , can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer  @xcite .",
    "however , if one supplements these operations with magic states , then one can also generate @xmath2-phase gates , which results in a computationally universal gate set  @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : review ] , we review the tensor category analysis of untwisted anyonic interferometers , following  @xcite . in section  [ sec : omega_loops ] , we introduce @xmath4-loops and their properties which are useful for our analysis . in section  [ sec : twisted_interferometers ] , we introduce and analyze twisted interferometers . in section  [ sec : topological_descriptions ] , we briefly discuss the topological formulation of ( twisted and untwisted ) anyonic interferometry in terms of dehn surgery of @xmath3-manifolds .",
    "this approach is considered in greater detail in a companion paper  @xcite . in section  [ sec : ising ] , we explicitly apply our twisted interferometry results to ising anyons and demonstrate how twisted interferometers can be used to generate magic states . in section  [ sec : fake_twist ] , we notice , as an aside inspired by twisted interferometry , that it is possible to use `` partial interferometry , ''",
    "i.e. running an ( untwisted ) interferometer for a fixed number of probes @xmath5 , to generate magic states for ising anyons , albeit in a topologically unprotected manner . in section",
    "[ sec : engineer_twist ] , we consider the possible implementation of twisted interferometers in physical systems , such as quantum hall states , 2d @xmath1 topological superconductors , and 2d majorana heterostructures , and discuss the significant obstacles and challenges associated with implementation .",
    "before describing twisted interferometry , it may be useful to review the effects and analysis of `` ordinary '' ( untwisted ) anyonic interferometry , following and borrowing heavily from  @xcite .",
    "we focus on an idealized mach - zehnder type interferometer  @xcite for quasiparticles with non - abelian anyonic braiding statistics .",
    "this will serve as a model for realistic interferometry experiments with anyons , and the methods used in this analysis readily apply to other classes of interferometers , e.g. ( fabrey - prot ) fractional quantum hall double point - contact interferometers in the weak tunneling limit .    for our analysis , we abstract to an idealized system that supports an arbitrary anyon model , a.k.a .",
    "unitary braided tensor category ( ubtc ) , and also allows for a number of desired manipulations to be effected .",
    "specifically , we posit the experimental abilities to : ( 1 ) produce , isolate , and position desired anyons , ( 2 ) provide anyons with some manner of propulsion to produce a beam of probe anyons , ( 3 ) construct lossless beam - splitters and mirrors , and ( 4 ) detect the presence of a probe anyon at the output legs of the interferometer .     are beam splitters .",
    "the target anyons ( collectively denoted @xmath6 ) in the central region share entanglement only with the anyon(s ) @xmath7 outside this region .",
    "a beam of probe anyons @xmath8 is sent through the interferometer and detected at one of the two possible outputs by @xmath9 . ]    the experimental setup for the anyonic mach - zehnder interferometer is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometer ] .",
    "the target anyon @xmath6 is the composite of all the anyons @xmath10 located inside the central interferometry region , and so may be in a superposition of states with different total anyonic charges . since these anyons are treated collectively by the experiment , we ignore their individuality ( and possible internal states ) and consider them as a single anyon @xmath6 capable of existing in superposition of different anyonic charges .",
    "anyons outside of the central interferometry region with which the target anyons share entanglement are denoted @xmath7 and will be similarly treated collectively .",
    "[ fig : interferometer ] only shows such charges below the interferometer , but such anyons may be distributed more generally , in which case it is useful to consider them in groups for each distinct region . ) we will similarly allow the probe anyons , @xmath8 to be treated as capable of charge superposition ( though , for most cases of interest , we can usually restrict our attention to identical probes with a definite value of anyonic charge ) .",
    "the probe anyons are sent as a beam into the interferometer through two possible input channels .",
    "they pass through a beam splitter @xmath11 , are reflected by mirrors around the central target region , pass through a second beam splitter @xmath12 , and then are detected at one of the two possible output channels by the detectors @xmath9 .",
    "when a probe anyon @xmath13 passes through the bottom path of the interferometer , the state acquires the phase @xmath14 , which results from background aharonov - bohm interactions  @xcite , path length differences , phase shifters , etc . , and is also acted upon by the braiding operator @xmath15 , which is strictly due to the braiding statistics between the probe and target anyons .",
    "similarly , when the probe passes through the top path of the interferometer , the state acquires the phase @xmath16 and is acted on by @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of running such an interferometry will generally depend on the probe anyons and the variables of the device .",
    "however , we can summarize the effect for @xmath18 identical probes as follows  @xcite :    \\(1 ) the collective charge of the target anyons @xmath6 will be projected onto one of the subsets of charge types that the probes are able to distinguish from other subsets via monodromy .",
    "( when the probes are able to distinguish between all anyonic charge types , these subsets each contain only one anyonic charge type and projection is onto a state where @xmath6 has a definite collective charge value . )",
    "\\(2 ) anyonic entanglement ( encoded via connecting anyonic charge lines ) across the paths of the probe anyons , i.e. between the target anyons @xmath6 and other anyons outside the interferometer @xmath7 , will be decohered if the probe anyons are able to detect the charges encoding such entanglement  @xcite .",
    "( when the probes are able to distinguish between all anyonic charge types , they can detect all charges , except the trivial vacuum charge , so the final state will have no charge lines connecting anyons in the interior of the interferometer with anyons in the exterior . )",
    "we describe the precise meaning of these statement in more mathematical detail in the following sections .      in this section",
    ", we review the mach - zehnder interferometer in a general anyonic context .",

    "consequently , quasiparticles of quasi - topological phases will generally experience interactions with each other that falls off as a power law @xmath431 , rather than exponentially . in the more fortunate cases ( which are what people usually refer to as `` topological phases '' ) , the gapless excitations couple to the topological degrees of freedom in a seemingly benign way that does not destroy the topological properties of bulk quasiparticles , i.e. the topological state space and braiding statistics of non - abelian quasiparticles are preserved .",
    "however , even in these cases , there can be simple attractive / repulsive interactions , which , even though they do not differentiate between different topological states , will still causes problems for implementing twisted interferometry ( as previously discussed ) .",
    "for example , josephson vortices in topological superconductors and majorana heterostructures couple to electromagnetism , which results in @xmath432 interactions between them in a planar geometry .",
    "electrically charged quasiparticles in quantum hall states will experience a similar electromagnetic interaction .",
    "some quantum hall states are electrically neutral or have an electrically neutral subsector that could potentially be employed , but figuring out how to use this ( and not the electrically charged quasiparticles ) also poses a challenge . in practice",
    ", it may be possible to make power law interactions sufficiently small , e.g. if probe quasiparticle separations can be made large enough , if the coefficient of interaction is or can be made small , and/or if the power of interaction can somehow be increased to make the falloff faster .",
    "however , this depends on specific details of the device and microscopic properties of the particular system being used , and thus involves significant non - topological physics .    in summary , there are a number of crucial engineering issues and obstacles for implementing twisted interferometry that must be addressed more adequately than we have done here .",
    "we also leave detailed analysis of the functioning of twisted interferometers under non - ideal conditions as a topic beyond the scope of this paper .",
