    "one of the most intriguing observational recent results in cosmology concerns the possible accelerating phase of the universe today .",
    "this result comes from the observational programs of the type ia supernovae , carried out since the second half of the last decade @xcite .",
    "type ia supernovae seem to be excellent standard candles : their detonation mechanism occurs under very specific conditions and their absolute magnitude can be , in principle , easily inferred . for a more detailed discussion on this problem , see reference @xcite .",
    "the crossing of these results with those coming from the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite leads to a scenario where the matter content of the universe is composed essentially of @xmath19 of an unclustered component of negative pressure , the dark energy , and @xmath20 of a clustered component of zero pressure , the cold dark matter .",
    "the most natural candidate for dark energy seems to be the cosmological constant , since it can be connected with the vacuum energy in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "but , the small value resulting from observations for the energy density of the cosmological constant term , @xmath21 , leads to a discrepancy of about @xmath22 orders of magnitude with the theoretically predicted value @xcite .",
    "hence , other possibilities have been exploited in the literature , like quintessence , a kind of an inflaton self - interacting field adapted to the present phase of the universe @xcite .",
    "more recently , the chaplygin gas model ( cgm ) has been evoked @xcite .",
    "this model is based on a string inspired configuration that leads to a specific equation of state where pressure is negative and varies with the inverse of the density @xcite .",
    "this model has been generalized , giving birth to the generalized chaplygin gas model ( gcgm ) , where now the pressure varies with a power of the inverse of the density @xcite .",
    "these proposals have many advantages , among which we can quote the following : in spite of presenting a negative pressure , the sound velocity is positive , what assures stability @xcite ; these models can unify the description of dark energy and dark matter , since the fluid can clusters at small scale , remaining a smooth component at large scales @xcite ; the cg has an interesting connection with string theory @xcite .",
    "some criticisms have been addressed to the gcgm ( cgm ) mainly connected with its features related to the power spectrum for the agglomerated matter @xcite . however , in our opinion , this specific criticism is not conclusive , since the introduction of baryons may alleviate the objections presented against the cosmological scenarios based on the gcgm ( gcm ) @xcite .    in order to test these different models for dark energy ( and dark matter ) it is essential to compare their predictions against the different observational results available now .",
    "these observational results refer mainly to the type ia supernovae , the anisotropy of the cmbr , the x - ray data of clusters and super - clusters of galaxies , the gravitational lenses and the matter power spectrum .",
    "each observational test constrains differently the free parameters of the models ; the crossing of the informations coming from those observational data can strongly restrict or support a specific cosmological model . in carrying out this task , a statistical analysis must be applied for each particular observational test .",
    "one important point is how to perform this statistical analysis : the final conclusions may , in some cases , depend on the statistical framework ( bayesian , frequentist , etc . ) , as well as on the parameters that are allowed to be free , and how these parameters are constrained ( through a joint probability for two parameters , minimizing the error function or through a marginalization of all parameters excepted one , etc . ) . in some cases",
    ", the different procedures adopted may lead to quite different conclusions on the best value for a given set of parameters .",
    "the choice of the observational data sample may of course be important as well .    in preceding works @xcite we have tested the ordinary cgm and the gcgm against the type ia supernovae observational data .",
    "the comparison between theoretical prediction and observational data , in what concerns type ia supernovae , is made essentially by computing the luminosity function @xmath23 and re - expressing it as the distance moduli @xmath24 in terms of which the observational data are given . in those works , we employed a bayesian statistical analysis considering all possible free parameters , which were in number of @xmath25 for the cgm and @xmath26 for the gcgm . in reference",
    "@xcite , the same analysis has been also performed for the model with cosmological constant and cold dark matter ( @xmath27cdm ) , in order to allow a proper comparison between the different models . the final estimation for each parameter was obtained through the marginalization on all other parameters .",
    "one limitation of these previous works was the use of a sub - sample of 26 supernovae data .",
    "this sample seems to be very restrictive when we remember that there is today the `` gold '' sample , with 157 supernovae , and the `` silver '' sample with @xmath28 supernovae @xcite .",
    "samples of up to @xmath29 supernovae are now available @xcite . but",
    "the 26 supernovae of those works have a very good quality , and they lead to a quite small value for the @xmath30 fitting parameter : using the `` gold '' sample the value for @xmath30 increases a little .",
    "this reflects , for example , the fact that those larger samples contain supernovae whose observational status is not very well established : for example , they contain supernovae with the almost the same redshift @xmath31 but with different values for the luminosity distances , without a superposition of the error bars .",
    "however , the recent works on the subject employ enlarged samples of supernovae data for obvious reasons : they contain supernovae with @xmath32 , leading to a better estimation of the deceleration parameter today @xmath33 ; moreover , it is expected that the dispersion in the parameters estimations can be narrowed when more supernovae are used .",
    "hence , in this work , we return back to the problem of estimating parameters but now using the `` gold '' sample",
    ". we will do it for the gcgm , the cgm and for the @xmath34cdm model .",
    "the statistical method will be the same as in references @xcite .",
    "the type ia supernovae data have been used in many works to constraint the parameters of the gcgm @xcite@xcite . in these works , however , restrictions on some free parameters were introduced by , for example , fixing the curvature of the spatial section equal to zero or using a specific value for the hubble constant as suggested by the spectrum of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) . moreover ,",
    "a more simplified statistical treatment has been frequently employed , like the @xmath30 statistics . in almost all of them",
    "the parameter @xmath35 has been restricted to the interval @xmath36 .",
    "this last restriction has been alleviated in a recent works @xcite .",
    "for example ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath30 statistics and quartessence scenario ( that unifies dark matter and dark energy into a single fluid , the chaplygin gas , so the dark matter content is null ) have been employed , values of @xmath35 greater than @xmath37 have been allowed .",
    "the best value found for the parameter @xmath35 is @xmath38 for the flat case and @xmath39 for the non - flat case .",
    "the main reason to treat again this problem is to give a complete analysis of the gcgm , as well as of the cgm and @xmath27cdm , using all free parameters .",
    "the gold sample with 157 supernovae will be used .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 will be allowed to take any positive or negative value .",
    "the bayesian statistics will be employed , and the predicted values for each parameter will be obtained through the marginalization process . this last step leads to results quite different from those obtained through , for example , the @xmath30 statistics .",
    "in fact , even if we agree with the authors of references @xcite that the minimization method leads to @xmath2 positive ( in our case we find @xmath41 when all five free parameters are free ) , the marginalization on the other parameters indicates that the best value for this parameter is negative , although the dispersion is quite large and high positive values can not be excluded .    in treating three theoretical models (",
    "gcgm , cgm and @xmath18cdm ) we intend to give a more unified description of all these different cases . in what concerns the gcgm , the free parameters to be estimated are the value of the hubble constant today @xmath0 , the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath1 ( connected with the sound velocity of the fluid ) , the curvature parameter @xmath42 and the gcg parameter @xmath4 ( alternatively , the ordinary matter parameter @xmath43 ) . in the cgm ,",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is fixed to unity . for the @xmath44cdm model the parameters are @xmath0 , @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) and @xmath5 ( or the curvature parameter @xmath42 ) . in both cases",
    ", we also estimate the age of the universe @xmath46 , the deceleration parameter @xmath47 and the value of the scale factor at the moment the universe begins to accelerate @xmath48 ( which can also be expressed in terms of the redshift @xmath49 ) .",
    "we will exemplify the subtleties connected with the statistical analysis by displaying the analysis based only on the better @xmath50 value , on the joint probability of two different parameters and by marginalizing on all parameters excepting one . in order also to better compare with the literature , we will also consider some particular cases where the spatial curvature is fixed as flat , or the ordinary matter is fixed equal to @xmath51 ( inspired on the nucleosynthesis results ) or @xmath52 or fixing two of the parameters .",
    "our results indicate the following values for the parameters for each model . for the gcgm",
    "we find : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath8 , @xmath55 , @xmath10 , @xmath56 .",
    "for the cgm ( @xmath12 ) the estimations give : @xmath57 , @xmath14 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "finally , for the @xmath18cdm the results give : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "hence , our analysis indicate that the traditional chaplygin gas model can not be ruled out , at least in what concerns type ia supernovae data , and that the @xmath18cdm case is not the preferred one . however , the dispersions are large enough so that no definitive conclusion can be made . only through the crossing with other tests",
    "a more restrictive scenario can come up .",
    "however , in crossing the different tests , a uniform statistical procedure must be used .",
    "this work intends to be the initial step in this program .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", the model and the different relevant quantities are set up . in section",
    "@xmath65 we present the parameter estimation . in section",
    "@xmath25 we present our conclusions .",
    "the gcgm is obtained through the introduction of a perfect fluid with an equation of state given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath2 are constants . when @xmath12 we re - obtain the equation of state for the cgm .",
    "henceforth , we will use mainly the term _ generalized chaplygin gas model _ , keeping in mind that when @xmath12 we have the traditional _ chaplygin gas model_. in principle , the parameter @xmath2 is restricted in such a way that @xmath68 .",
    "however , we will allow @xmath2 to take negative and large positive values .",
    "negative values and values greater than @xmath37 can be potentially dangerous since they can lead to an imaginary sound velocity and a sound velocity greater than the velocity of light , respectively .",
    "but , these problems appear more dramatically at perturbative level . in this case , however , a fundamental description for the gcg must be employed ( for example , using self - interacting scalar fields ) what avoids those drawbacks .",
    "the supernovae data tests mainly the background model , and in this sense to enlarge the possible values of @xmath2 does not bring any difficulty .    in the gcgm we introduce also pressureless matter in order to take into account the presence of baryons in the universe and also in order to verify if the unified scenario ( where no dark matter is present ) is favoured by the data .",
    "hence , the dynamics of the universe is driven by the friedmann s equation @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 stand for the pressureless matter and chaplygin gas component , respectively .",
    "as usual , @xmath72 indicates a flat , closed and open spatial section .    the equations expressing the conservation law for each fluid ( [ be2],[be3 ] )",
    "lead to @xmath73 the value of the scale factor today is taken equal to unity , @xmath74 .",
    "hence , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the pressureless matter and gcg densities today . eliminating from the last relation the parameter @xmath77 , the gcg density at any time can be re - expressed as @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "this parameter @xmath1 is connected with the sound velocity for the chaplygin gas today by the relation @xmath80 .",
    "the luminosity distance is given by @xcite @xmath81 @xmath82 being the co - moving coordinate of the source .",
    "using the expression for the propagation of light @xmath83 and the friedmann s equation ( [ be1 ] ) , we can re - express the luminosity distance as @xmath84 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86^{1/(1+\\alpha ) } - \\omega_{k0}(z^{\\prime}+ 1)^2\\}^{1/2 } } \\quad , \\ ] ] with the definitions @xmath87 such that the condition @xmath88 holds .",
    "the final equations have been also expressed in terms of the redshift @xmath89 .",
    "the age of the universe and the value of the decelerated parameter @xmath90 are given by @xmath91^{1/(1+\\alpha ) } -\\omega _ { k0}(z^{\\prime } + 1)^{2}\\}^{1/2}}\\quad , \\\\ q_{0 } & = & \\frac{\\omega",
    "_ { m0}+\\omega _ { c0}(1 - 3\\bar{a})}{2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 , so that @xmath93 has units of years .",
    "the value @xmath94  of the scale factor signs the start of the recent accelerating phase of the universe , it is given by the roots of the equation @xmath95 and is related to the redshift value @xmath96 such that @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "following the same lines sketched above , we can obtain the corresponding expressions for the @xmath18cdm model .",
    "however , it is easier just to insert in the above relations the condition @xmath99 in order to recover the @xmath44cdm case .    in order to compare the theoretical results with the observational data",
    ", we must compute the distance moduli , as given by relation ( [ dm ] ) .",
    "a crucial aspect of the present work is the employment of the bayesian statistics , which will be outlined in the next section .",
    "the first step in this sense is to compute the quality of the fitting through the least squared fitting quantity @xmath100 defined by @xmath101 in this expression , @xmath102 is the measured value , @xmath103 is the value calculated through the model described above , @xmath104 is the measurement error and includes the dispersion in the distance modulus due to the dispersion in galaxy redshift due to peculiar velocities , following ref . @xcite .",
    "to constraint the five independent parameters for the gcgm , the four independent parameters for the cgm and the three parameters for @xmath27cdm , we use the bayesian statistical analysis . the method and its motivation",
    "are described in detail in ref .",
    "since there is no prior constraint , the probability of the set of distance moduli @xmath105 conditional on the values of a set of parameters @xmath106 is given by a product of gaussian functions : @xmath107 \\label{pd1}\\ ] ] this probability distribution must be normalized .",
    "evidently , when , for a set of values of the parameters , the @xmath30 is minimum the probability is maximum .",
    "this is a valuable information but is not enough to constraint the parameters . in table",
    "@xmath37 the values of the parameters for the maximum probability ( minimum @xmath100 ) is given , using the gold sample of supernovae , for the gcgm with five free parameters and for other cases where the baryonic , the curvature or both are fixed .",
    "the same estimations are presented in tables @xmath108 and @xmath65 for the cgm and @xmath27cdm .",
    "note first that the minimum values for @xmath109 using the `` gold sample '' are higher than the corresponding ones using the restricted sample of 26 supernovae @xcite .",
    "note also that from this point of view , the best value for the parameter @xmath35 is much bigger than @xmath37 .",
    "these results must be compared with a more complete analysis to be presented below . for more details about the @xmath109 minimization process ,",
    "@xcite .",
    ".the best - fitting parameters , i.e. , when @xmath110 is minimum , for each type of spatial section and matter content of the generalized chaplygin gas model .",
    "@xmath111 is given in @xmath112 , @xmath113 in units of @xmath114 , @xmath93 in @xmath115 and @xmath94 in units of @xmath116 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from the probability distribution ( [ pd1 ] ) , a joint probability distribution for any subset of parameters can be obtained by integrating ( marginalizing ) on the remaining parameters , see refs .",
    "this is a valuable information .",
    "but , in order to estimate properly a single parameter , the probability distribution must be marginalized on all other parameters .",
    "this in general gives a quite different result if we try to estimate the parameter in a two or three - dimensional parameter space .",
    "the reason is that , in such multidimensional parameter space , if a parameter has a large probability density but in a narrow region , the total contribution of this region may be quite small compared to other large regions which have small probability : in the marginalization process , this kind of high pdf region contributes little to the estimation of a given parameter .",
    "these features are exemplified in figure [ figpdf3dm04 ] where the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the set of parameters ( @xmath117 ) in the gcgm case is displayed , with a clearly non - gaussian behaviour .",
    "hence , in what follows the estimation of a given parameter will be made by marginalizing on all other ones .      in the case of five free parameters ,",
    "the procedure described above gives @xmath119 .",
    "note that this prediction differs substantially from that extracted from the minimization of @xmath30 , which gives a large positive best value @xmath35 , instead of a negative @xmath40 when the marginalization is made .",
    "concerning the best value when the marginalization is made , even if the best value is negative , the dispersion is quite high , so even large positive values are not excluded , at least at @xmath120 level . comparing our results with other ones",
    "already published requires some care due to the fact that usually in the works already quoted some parameters are fixed . moreover ,",
    "the allowed values for @xmath35 are generally restricted to the interval @xmath121 $ ] , except in references @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors considered @xmath122 , a flat spatial section and they have fixed the value of the hubble constant .",

    "this behaviour may be an issue for future analyses of the gcgm and cgm using thousands of sne ia ( from snap and other projects ) .",
    "the traditional chaplygin gas model , where @xmath294 , remains in general competitive .",
    "when the five parameters are considered , the probability to have this value is of @xmath140 .",
    "but , this probability increases as much as to @xmath295 if the curvature is fixed to zero and if only baryons account to the pressureless matter .",
    "so , as far as the type ia supernovae data are considered , the chaplygin gas scenario is not ruled out .    as a logical future step",
    ", we plan to cross the estimations from different observational data , like gravitational lensing , the large scale structures data ( 2dfrgs ) , the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and x - ray gas mass fraction data @xcite .",
