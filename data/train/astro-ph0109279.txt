    "there is growing interest in finding and characterizing young stellar systems in the solar neighborhood since their proximity offers unique advantages for improving our understanding of star and planet formation . over the past five years",
    ", a number of young associations have been identified within 100 pc of the sun , and these have become the targets of intense investigations using a variety of techniques ( jayawardhana & greene 2001 ) .",
    "hd 199143 is a bright f8v ( houk & smith - moore 1988 ) star in capricornus with a _ hipparcos _ distance of 47.7 @xmath1 2.4 pc .",
    "it was detected as a bright extreme - ultraviolet source by the _ rosat _ and _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ satellites ( pounds et al .",
    "1993 ; malina et al .",
    "recently , in a study of its optical and ultraviolet spectra , van den ancker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found the emission lines of mg ii , c i , c ii , c iii , c iv , si iv , he ii , and n v and a high level of variability , both in the continuum and line fluxes .",
    "the authors also present evidence for very rapid ( a few hundred km s@xmath2 ) rotation of the stellar photosphere , and for excess emission in the mid - infrared , detected by _ iras _ at 12@xmath3 m .",
    "van den ancker et al . proposed that all of these phenomena can be explained if hd 199143 has a low - mass chromospherically active companion that dominates the ultraviolet and infrared emission of the system .",
    "episodic accretion of material from a putative t tauri like companion could have spun up the primary and may also account for the bursting or flaring nature of this object .",
    "the same authors pointed out that the photometrically variable k7-m0e dwarf hd 358623 ( bd-17 6128 ) , previously studied by mathioudakis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , is located only 5 arcminutes from hd 199143 .",
    "the optical spectrum of hd 358623 is identical to that of many classical t tauri stars , and shows strong h@xmath4 emission and li 6708    absorption lines .",
    "the closeness of the two stars on the sky and the similarity of their proper motions , derived from the tycho-2 catalog , led van den ancker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to suggest that the pair belong to a physical group that may include additional young stars . at a distance of @xmath048 pc , hd 358623 is estimated to be @xmath5 years old an age comparable to the timescales of inner disk evolution and planet formation ( jayawardhana 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "given their proximity , interesting age and possible membership in a co - moving stellar group , hd 199143 and hd 358623 are worthy of further study .",
    "here we present the results of near - infrared adaptive optics imaging observations of both stars that reveal each to be a close binary .",
    "the newly discovered companion to hd 199143 may indeed account for the engimatic characteristics of that system .",
    "we observed hd199143 and hd358623 on 2001 may 31 to june 1 with the european southern observatory 3.6-meter telescope at la silla , chile , using the adaptive optics near infrared system ( adonis ) and the sharpii+ camera .",
    "the sharpii+ camera is based on a 256@xmath6256 nicmos  iii array .",
    "we used a plate scale of 0.035arcsec / pixel , nyquist - sampling the diffraction limited point spread function ( psf ) in @xmath7 and giving an effective field of view of @xmath6 .",
    "we observed the targets by taking a series of frames on source and chopping out for sky frames .",
    "for hd199143 we obtained 42 frames in @xmath7 , each of integration time 3s , and 42 frames in @xmath8 of 2s each .",
    "for hd358623 we obtained 10@xmath620s in @xmath7 and 22@xmath610s in @xmath8 .",
    "the science target itself was used as the wavefront sensor of the adaptive optics ( ao ) system .",
    "the seeing during the observations , as reported by the la silla seeing monitor , was about in @xmath9 ( 0.55@xmath3 m ) .",
    "after each series of observations of the science targets , an identical series of observations with the same ao correction parameters were obtained of a psf calibrator star , for post processing purposes .",
    "for hd199143 we used the f3iv star sao163887 with @xmath9 magnitude 6.8 , and for hd358623 we used the m0 star sao163911 with @xmath9 magnitude 9.8 .",
    "the basic data reductions were done in a standard way by subtracting sky frames from source frames and then dividing by a flat field obtained on sky during dusk .",
    "the resulting frames were then not stacked together but instead processed with the myopic deconvolution algorithm idac .    from the psf",
    "calibrator star observations , we obtained an initial guess of the psf during the science data acquisition .",
    "since the psf calibrator star data were not obtained simultaneously with the science data , the initial guess psf is then modified by idac iteratively to better match the different frames of science data .",
    "a series of psf estimates corresponding to the science object series is thus produced along with the deconvolved image .",
    "the deconvolution procedure using idac took about two weeks of processing time on an ultrasparc workstation .",
    "we refer to christou et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for details on idac .",
    "we performed astrometry of the hd199143 and hd358623 systems using the deconvolved images in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the error in separation",
    "was estimated by checking the consistency of measured separations in @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for flux calibration , we used observations of the ir standard star hd190285 and 5 other sao stars in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for the sao stars ,",
    "known @xmath10 and @xmath9 magnitudes and spectral classes were used to derive their @xmath7 and @xmath8 magnitudes using standard colors ( bessell & brett 1988 ) and an estimate of the color excess due to extinction using table  1 of mathis ( 1990 ) , where we assumed an optical extinction ratio @xmath11 .",
    "we then fitted a relation between the observed count rates and derived magnitudes .    from the fit we estimated the absolute photometric errors , i.e. the uncertainty of the transformation from measured counts to magnitudes . by checking the consistency of the measured flux of stars observed several times during the night we derived the relative photometric errors",
    "we have resolved both hd 199143 and hd 358623 into close binaries for the first time .",
    "figure 1 shows the deconvolved @xmath7 and @xmath8 images , and table 1 presents photometric and astrometric measurements of each system .",
    "our observations are able to detect binaries at separations between and @xmath12 , where the lower limit corresponds to the diffraction limit of the 3.6-m telescope in @xmath7 , and the upper limit is due to the @xmath6 field of view .",
    "a search of the 2mass catalog reveals that the surface density of stars brighter than @xmath13 within a 5-degree radius of our targets is @xmath00.004 arcmin@xmath14 .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the companions we found are unrelated field stars .",
    "our @xmath15 color , as well as the @xmath16 color from the simbad database , of hd 199143 a is consistent that of a f8v star with no foreground extinction . using a distance of 48 pc and the atmosphere models of allard , hauschildt & schweitzer ( 2000 )",
    ", we find a _",
    "bolometric _ luminosity of @xmath17 .",
    "stellar evolutionary models of palla & stahler ( 1999 ) yield a mass of @xmath18 and an age of 18@xmath12 myrs for the primary .",
    "( the errors given for the stellar parameters are the formal uncertainties in statistical model fitting plus measurement errors ; `` true '' errors due to inherent uncertainties in the models are likely to be larger . )",
    "the newly discovered companion , hd 199143 b , is extremely red , with @xmath15=1.368 .",
    "this near - infrared color corresponds to a model atmosphere with a temperature in the 1700 - 2100 k range , which ( taken at face value ) would imply a very young object in the brown dwarf / giant planet mass regime . however , hd 199143 b most likely harbors a circumstellar disk , responsible for @xmath8-band excess as well as the iras 12@xmath3 m detection and ground - based mid - infrared measurements previously reported for the system ( van den ancker et al .",
    "2001 ) . given the lack of optical colors and a spectral type , it is difficult to derive reliable stellar parameters for the secondary .",
    "however , assuming an age of 18 myrs and the excess to be zero at @xmath7 and a free parameter at @xmath8 , we find @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and a @xmath15 excess of @xmath00.5 mag , consistent with a t tauri like star .",
    "if hd 199143 b indeed harbors a dusty disk but hd 199143 a does not , a scenario in agreement with our data , it would be a rare example of a close binary with only a circum_secondary _ disk . in a study of 25 close , pre - main - sequence binaries , prato ( 1998 ) found disks around both stars in 15 systems and neither star in 5 systems .",
    "four others showed evidence of circum_primary _ disks ( also see jayawardhana et al .",
    "1999 ) while only one example of a circum_secondary _ disk was identified .",
    "theoretical calculations suggest that circumstellar disks will be truncated by the tidal effects of a companion star in circular orbit at approximately 0.9 of the average roche lobe radius ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) . from the _ iras _ database , van den ancker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived a flux of 0.24@xmath10.04 jy in the 12@xmath3 m band , and upper limits of 0.12 , 0.12 , and 0.30 jy for the fluxes at 25 , 60 and 100@xmath3 m , respectively .",
    "a tidally truncated disk around hd 199143 b is consistent with the tight _ iras _ limits at 25 and 60@xmath3 m .    our @xmath15 color and the simbad @xmath16 color for hd 358623 a imply very little extinction ( @xmath210.1mag ) .",
    "for a k7 spectral type , assuming an age of 18 myrs to be coeval with hd 199143 , we find @xmath22 and @xmath23 for a distance of 43 pc .",
    "conversely , if we fix the distance at 48 pc , we get a slightly worse fit to the evolutionary models with an age of 12@xmath14 myrs , again in reasonable agreement with the age of hd 199143 . using",
    "a distance of 43 pc , stellar models yield @xmath24 , @xmath25 and an age of 20@xmath17 myrs for the newly found secondary , hd 358623 b. van den ancker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) report significant mid - infrared excesses from hd 358623 .",
    "our observations do not constrain whether the dust surrounds one or both members of the binary .",
    "using adaptive optics techniques , we have resolved the two nearby ( @xmath048 pc ) young stars hd 199143 and hd 358623 into close binaries .",
    "the newly discovered secondary may account for many of the puzzling characteristics of the hd 199143 system .",
    "if the b component harbors a dusty disk , as indicated by its near - infrared colors and consistent with previous mid - infrared detections , hd 199143 would be a rare example of a close binary with only a circum_secondary _ disk .",
    "the stellar parameters we derive for each component of hd 199143 and hd 358623 , while not tightly constrained , are in agreement with both systems being 15@xmath15 myrs in age at a distance of 43 - 48 pc .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy of both binaries would allow us to determine the stellar parameters more reliably , and follow - up astrometry could yield direct dynamical masses , thus testing evolutionary models of pre - main - sequence stars . high - resolution mid - infrared imaging will be valuable for further constraining the location and nature of circumstellar dust in these two binaries .",
    "a systematic search for other young stars in the vicinity of hd 199143 and hd 358623 may reveal additional members of a co - moving stellar group , enhancing our understanding of local star formation and enriching our inventory of suitable nearby targets for detailed multi - wavelength studies .",
    "we wish to thank the staff of the european southern observatory for their outstanding support .",
    "we are grateful to tom greene for a previous attempt to observe hd 199143 at the irtf , and to the referee , mario van den ancker , for a prompt review .",
    "our research made use of the ads , simbad and 2mass databases .",
