    "friedel oscillations have remained a theoretical prediction that could be seen only in theory textbooks @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the stm has enabled the visualization of these oscillations , which manifest themselves as oscillations of the differential tunneling conductance , @xmath1 , around defects on the surface .",

    "the circular 2d fermi contour of the electrons at the ( 111 ) surface of noble metals results from the fact that the layer of surface atoms actually corresponds to one of the close - packed stackings on which the face - centered cubic structure is based .",

    "thus , after @xmath0 revolutions the electron returns to the contact axis at the point @xmath467 the phase which the electron acquires along the spiral trajectory is composed of two parts , @xmath468 the first , @xmath469 is the ` geometric ' phase accumulated by an electron with wave vector @xmath470 over the distance @xmath114 .",

    "in this section we present the results of a theoretical investigation of the conductance , @xmath488 , of a normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) point contact ( with radius @xmath489 ) in the tunnelling limit and discuss the quantum interference effects originating from the scattering of quasiparticles by a point - like nonmagnetic defect @xcite .",
    "the model is described in sec .",
    "ii and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ contact ] , modified with having the half - space @xmath490 occupied by a ( @xmath0-wave ) superconductor . at zero temperature a tunnel current flows through the contact for an applied bias @xmath154 larger than the energy gap of the superconductor @xmath491 . in order to evaluate the total current through the contact , @xmath133 , the current density @xmath492 of quasiparticles with momentum @xmath128 at @xmath493 formed by electrons transmitted through the contact must be found .",
    "the current density @xmath494 is expressed in terms of the coefficients @xmath495 and @xmath496 of the canonical bogoliubov transformation @xcite . the functions @xmath497 and @xmath496 satisfy the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations @xcite , which must be supplemented with a self - consistency condition for the order parameter @xmath498 , and boundary conditions which connect @xmath499 and @xmath500 in the normal metal to those in the superconductor at the contact .",
    "for a tunnel contact one can neglect andreev reflections , because these lead to corrections to the conductance proportional to @xmath501 @xcite ; the functions @xmath499 and @xmath500 satisfy the same boundary conditions ( equal2 ) , ( [ jump2 ] ) as the wave function for a contact between normal metals .",
    "it is obvious that the method described in sec .",
    "ii and sec .",
    "iii can be generalized to ns contacts . as a first step",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations must be solved in linear approximation in the transmission amplitude @xmath75 in the absence of the defect , @xmath502 after which the corrections due to the scattering by the defect can be found . in ref .",
    "avotina08ns an analytical solution for the bdg equations was found with the approximation of a homogeneous order parameter @xmath503    at small applied bias @xmath504 ( @xmath505 is the debye frequency ) , and in linear approximation in the electron - defect interaction constant @xmath11 the conductance @xmath488  of a ns tunnel point contact can be presented as the sum of two terms , @xmath506the first term , @xmath507 , in eq .",

    "although such result is not unexpected and has been confirmed by experiment @xcite , for a contact of radius @xmath511 it was not obvious and it is first obtained in ref .",
    "the second term describes the oscillatory dependence of the conductance with the distance between the contact and the defect .",

    "note that we kept the second term in square brackets in the formula for @xmath519 ( eq .",
    "( [ psi_k ] ) ) because for large @xmath378 @xmath520 the phase shift of the oscillations may be important .",
    "thus , we have reviewed some theoretical aspects of the possibility of investigating subsurface defects by stm experiments .",
    "the theoretical results show that the amplitude of the oscillations of the stm conductance resulting from quantum interference of electron waves injected by the stm tip and scattered by the defect remains sufficiently large ( @xmath521 ) , even for defects located more than 10 atomic layers below the surface .",
    "for example , in the stm experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath522 ( at 1  na , 400  hz sample frequency ) have been achieved .",
    "recently , the possibility of observing defects at such depths below the surface has been demonstrated in experiment @xcite .",
    "the stm tip plays the role of `` locator '' , which detects a defect below the metal surface by using electron waves .",
    "the defect in turn produces information about its ( defect ) characteristics , as well as showing properties of the host metal by producing friedel - like oscillations in the stm conductance .",
    "the phase of the oscillations , @xmath523 is defined by the fermi wave vector @xmath524 and the tip - defect distance @xmath173 one of the possibilities to determine the defect depth @xmath165 below surface is by changing the maximal value of the wave vector by accelerating the electrons with an applied bias @xmath154 avotina05,avotina09ltp25 .",
    "when the tip is situated above the defect , the period of the oscillations in @xmath525 , @xmath526 , uniquely defines @xmath527 as the period of the oscillations becomes longer for small @xmath114 the minimum detectable depth will be determined by the maximum voltage that can be applied over the junction .",
    "for example , 30 mv is sufficient for probing a quarter of a conductance oscillation caused by a defect at 1  nm depth .",
    "another factor in setting the oscillation phase is the shape of the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "as was shown , for an anisotropic fs @xmath528 the phase and amplitude of conductance oscillations depend on the characteristics of the fs in the point for which the direction of the velocity @xmath529 is parallel to the vector @xmath234 directed from the stm tip to the defect @xcite .",
    "namely , the phase of the oscillations is defined by the projection of @xmath128 on the direction of @xmath530 and the oscillation amplitude depends on the curvature of the fs .",
    "depending on the geometry of the fs there can be several points with the same direction of the velocity , or , if the fs has open parts , certain directions of the velocity can be forbidden .",
    "it follows from the results above that curves of constant phase @xmath531 ( maxima and minima ) in the interference pattern of the stm conductance show the contours formed by projections of the vector @xmath128 on the vector normal to the fs .",
    "although such contours reflect the main features of the fs geometry , they can not be considered as a direct imaging of the fs .",
    "electron scattering by subsurface magnetic defects in stm conductance possesses some features distinct from the scattering by magnetic adatoms and the form and sign of the kondo anomaly due to a subsurface magnetic defect depend on the depth @xcite . near the kondo resonance",
    "the scattering phase shift @xmath111 tends to @xmath532 , and including multiple electron scattering events after reflections by the metal surface becomes essential .",
    "this explains the appearance of harmonics in the oscillatory part of the conductance , which have an additional phase shift @xmath533 where @xmath328 is the number of electron reflections by the surface .",
    "the determination of this phase shift near the kondo resonance @xmath534 and far from it ( where @xmath535 ) for the first @xmath536 and second @xmath537 harmonics provides an alternative way to find the depth of the defect @xmath527    the possibilities of investigating magnetic defects are extended by injecting a spin - polarized current .",
    "if the subsurface cluster possesses an unscreened magnetic moment @xmath344 , the scattering amplitudes of spin - up and spin - down electrons are different .",
    "this results in a dependence of the oscillation amplitude on the angle between the vector @xmath538 and the polarization direction of the stm current - referred to as a magneto - orientational effect @xcite .",
    "a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the metal surface changes the interference pattern in the stm conductance fundamentally . as a result of zeeman splitting @xmath539 of the landau energy levels",
    "the interference patterns formed in the dependence @xmath540 by electrons with different spin directions do not coincide because of different electron wave lengths for energies @xmath541 the superposition of the two oscillatory parts may result in a beating of the total amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "along with the well - known quantum oscillations having the periodicity in @xmath542 of the de haas - van alphen effect in the stm conductance , in the presence of a defect two new types of oscillations are present .",
    "the first is related to flux quantization through the projection of the electron trajectory on the surface plane .",
    "the second type of oscillation @xmath543 is related to a focusing effect of the magnetic field . as in sharvin s",
    "two - point contact experiments , in which electrons were focused on a collector by a magnetic field directed along the line connecting the contacts ( geometry of longitudinal electron focusing ) sharvin , the magnetic field can periodically focus the electrons injected by the tip onto the defect .",
    "this results in periodic increasing or decreasing of the part of the conductance related to the scattering by the defect @xcite .",
    "if the electrons tunnel from a normal - metal stm tip into a superconductor the wave incident on the contact is transformed into a superposition of ` electron - like ' and ` hole - like ' quasiparticles . in the case of a location of the defect in the superconductor quantum interference takes place between the partial wave that is transmitted and the one that is scattered by the defect , for both types of quasiparticles independently ( eq .  ( [ dg_s ] ) ) .",
    "although the difference between wave vectors @xmath544 of ` electrons ' and ` holes ' is small the shift @xmath545 between the two oscillations should be observable @xcite ."
