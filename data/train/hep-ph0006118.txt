    "one of the most striking results obtained at the desy hera @xmath0 collider was the discovery by the h1 and zeus collaborations @xcite that deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) events tagged with rapidity gaps exhibit mass distributions whose shape resemble very much those observed in hadron - hadron diffraction experiments .",
    "more recently , both the h1 and zeus collaborations reported @xcite analyses of another class of dis events whose pretty flat distribution turned out to be quite similar to the _ _ l__eading particle spectrum , also observed in hadron reactions .",
    "these similarities suggest that the regge pole phenomenology @xcite , successfully used to describe diffractive events and the leading particle effect in hadron processes @xcite , might also be employed to analyze the corresponding events obtained in dis .",
    "a ) kinematic variables for the reaction @xmath1 ; b ) kinematic variables for the semi - inclusive reaction @xmath2 , where @xmath3 stands for a proton or neutron.,height=604 ]    in a conventional dis process , @xmath4 , a high energy electron of four - momentum @xmath5 interacts with a proton of four - momentum @xmath6 through the emission of a photon of virtuality @xmath7 .",
    "as long as the photon has high enough momentum , it can resolve the internal partonic structure of the proton , interacting with its partons through a hard scattering which breaks up the hadron . in this inclusive reaction only the outgoing electron is detected in the final state ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "if , besides the electron , one specific kind of hadron is detected in the final state , we have a semi - inclusive dis process , @xmath8 .",
    "among processes of this kind there are events for which it is possible to recognize , in the final hadronic state , particles that bear some identity with the original proton , _",
    "i_.e . , they are close in rapidity to the original proton and carry a significant fraction of its momentum . in a particular case , events such as these may be characterized by a large rapidity gap between the products of the @xmath9 hard scattering and the outgoing proton debris ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "if those debris are identified with a proton , neutron or any other baryon close related to the original proton , we have the above mentioned _ _ l__eading baryon effect , @xmath10 , which , in analogy with the hadron case @xcite , could , in principle , be described by regge phenomenology in terms of reggeon and pion exchanges @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the detected baryon is carrying more than 90% of the incoming proton momentum and is identified with a proton itself ( or , equivalently , if a rapidity gap is detected nearby the proton fragmentation region ) , then the dominant interaction mechanism is a single diffractive scattering , @xmath11 , in which the virtual photon interacts with the proton through a color singlet exchange with the vacuum quantum numbers , which in regge phenomenology is known as pomeron exchange @xcite .    with the above statements we just intend to make the point that , speaking in terms of theory , diffractive dis events are part of a wider class of interactions , the semi - inclusive dis processes , within which the leading particle effect is found",
    "thus , if one wants to capture the regge behavior presumably observed by a certain kind of dis data , one should take into account all available data at once , which , in this case , means to consider simultaneously diffractive and leading particle data in the same analysis .",
    "this is the scope of the present paper .",
    "semi - inclusive processes have been measured by the h1 and zeus collaborations in the hera @xmath12 colliding machine at desy , where positrons of @xmath13 collide with protons of @xmath14 .",
    "the h1 collaboration has made high - statistic measurements of the diffractive structure function @xmath15 in the process @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents a hadronic system with mass lower than @xmath18 and rapidity closest to that of the incident proton .",
    "h1 also measured the leading proton and neutron structure functions , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , in the reaction @xmath21 , where @xmath3 is the identified nucleon .",
    "the zeus collaboration has measurements of the diffractive structure function @xmath15 in the reaction @xmath22 @xcite , and preliminary leading baryon measurements have also been reported @xcite .",
    "now , let us examine these experimental findings through a phenomenological gaze .",
    "the first attempts to describe them by the regge formalism were based on the ingelman and schlein model @xcite by which diffraction in dis is understood as a two - step process : first the proton emits a pomeron , then the pomeron is hard scattered by the virtual photon . in such a view , the pomeron is a quasi - particle that carries a fraction @xmath23 of the proton s momentum and has its own structure function that could be expressed in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( here @xmath24 plays the role of the bjorken variable for the pomeron ; see its definition in the next section ) .",
    "accordingly , the measured structure function @xmath26 would be factorized as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the flux of the pomeron out of the proton , which is a function of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the squared four - momentum transferred at the proton vertex .",
    "@xmath31 represents here the pomeron structure function .",
    "several analyses were made based on eq .",
    "( [ ism ] ) and on this factorization hypothesis , including those performed by the h1 and zeus collaborations @xcite ( see also @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "in fact , this kind of analyses has been used to establish the pomeron intercept @xmath32 from the diffractive dis data .    although the preliminary experimental results seemed to confirm the factorization hypothesis @xcite , subsequent high - statistic data measured in an extended kinematical region by the h1 collaboration proved that such a simple factorized expression is clearly violated @xcite .",
    "since then it has been conjectured @xcite that secondary reggeonic exchanges could play an important role in diffractive events , in such a way that the structure function could be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the reggeon flux factor , and @xmath35 is the reggeon structure function . within this approach ,",
    "the change in the diffractive pattern displayed by the h1 data could be explained without giving up the idea of regge factorization for each contribution .",
    "the h1 collaboration itself was very successful in describing the bulk of the diffractive structure function data with a fitting expression akin to eq .",
    "( [ strc1 ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , not only the diffractive data , but also the h1 leading proton structure function data can be fairly described within the same framework as well by just adding up to eq .",
    "( [ strc1 ] ) an extra pion contribution as required in such a case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the leading neutron structure function is described by the same scheme , but in that case only pion exchange is necessary @xcite .",
    "since the leading baryon data were obtained some time after the diffractive structure function measurements , these h1 analyses were performed independent of each other . however , as stated previously , it is our belief that both diffractive and leading proton processes should be analyzed together , as two parts of the same semi - inclusive process , in the same fashion as in the hadronic case . in this way it would be possible to establish more precisely the role of the pomeron and the secondary reggeon exchanges , since the diffractive data are dominated by the former and has the latter only as a background , while the reverse is true for the leading proton data .",
    "therefore , in this work we consider these data sets as complementary ones , _",
    ", our basic assumption is that the diffractive and leading proton structure functions are parts of one and the same semi - inclusive proton structure function , which can be expressed in a way similar to eq .",
    "( [ strc1 ] ) . throughout this work",
    "we will use the notation @xmath36 for the semi - inclusive proton structure function , when referring to the diffractive and leading proton structure function data together .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reach a better understanding about the role of the pomeron and reggeon contributions in the interface between the diffractive and non - diffractive regimes through a global fit of the proton structure function obtained from h1 semi - inclusive dis data ( the zeus data were not employed in the fitting procedure , but their diffractive structure function measurements were used for checking our final results ) . in sec.[kinematics ] , we define the kinematical variables and cross sections while our fitting procedure is presented in sec.[model ] . in sec.[results ] , we present our fit results and a preliminary discussion , while a procedure to compare diffractive and leading proton data is described in sec.[bringing ] .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in sec.[conclusions ] .",
    "the usual variables employed to describe @xmath12 dis are depicted in fig .",
    "one can define the squared energy in the @xmath12 center of mass system ( cms ) in terms of the four - momenta @xmath6 and @xmath5 , referring respectively to the incoming proton and electron ( or positron ) , as @xmath37 and the squared energy in the @xmath38 cms as @xmath39 the photon virtuality @xmath7 , the bjorken @xmath40 and the variable @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 if we ignore the proton mass , we have the following relations among these variables : @xmath43 and @xmath44 being that @xmath45 has been assumed in the latter expression .    for the case presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , where a baryon with four - momentum @xmath46 is detected in the final state , we can also define the variables @xmath47 where the @xmath24 variable represents the fraction of momentum carried by a struck parton in the pomeron ( if a pomeron exchange model is assumed ) .",
    "also , for leading baryons , it is usual to describe the data in terms of the fraction of momentum carried by the outgoing proton , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is connected with @xmath23 by @xmath50    the differential cross section for a semi - inclusive dis process giving rise to leading baryon behavior is written as @xmath51 \\;f_{2}^{lb(3)}(z , x , q^{2 } ) .",

    "such assumption was applied for those data with @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "thus , our analysis is directed to study the behavior of both @xmath55 and @xmath56 data .",
    "we notice that these data are already integrated over the @xmath30-range corresponding to their respective experiments . in order to compare these data among themselves",
    "it is necessary to explicitly introduce the @xmath30-dependence on the structure functions .",
    "we discuss that issue in details in sec . [ bringing ] .",
    "in the present study we have used the diffractive structure function data @xmath15 obtained by the h1 collaboration @xcite , together with their measurements of the leading baryon structure functions @xmath19 for protons and @xmath20 for neutrons @xcite , in the same analysis .",
    "the @xmath15 data cover the kinematical ranges : @xmath58 while , for the leading baryon @xmath59 measurements , the covered kinematical region are : @xmath60    we notice that , although these data sets are overlapping in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath25 ranges , they are complementary in terms of the @xmath24 , the bjorken variable for the presumable pomeron constituents .    as stated before , the h1 diffractive structure function , @xmath56 , can be written as a combination of two regge exchanges with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , the pomeron and the reggeon ones @xcite .",
    "the most general expression for such a diffractive structure function reads    @xmath61    here , functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent , respectively , the pomeron and reggeon flux factors integrated over @xmath30 , while @xmath31 and @xmath35 are the pomeron and reggeon structure functions .",
    "the last term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ f2d3 ] ) , @xmath64 , accounts for a possible interference effect between the pomeron and reggeon exchanges .",
    "the fluxes are taken from the regge phenomenology of hadronic soft diffraction , and are written as    @xmath65    and @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the minimum and maximum absolute @xmath30 values of the data for each experiment . in these expressions , the parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 are , respectively , the intercept and slope of the pomeron and reggeon linear trajectories , that is @xmath73 and @xmath74 in eq .",

    "following their procedure , we introduced a free parameter @xmath78 to account for the degree of interference between the pomeron and reggeon exchanges .",

    "we mostly intend to explore the connection between the diffractive and leading proton regimes , although the available data are quite separated in terms @xmath24 .",

    ", we also choose to identify the reggeon exchange explicitly with the @xmath97 family of resonances , which has the right quantum numbers for the processes analyzed here and is characterized by its high intercept , @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "for the leading proton structure function , @xmath99 , besides the pomeron and reggeon contributions , the pion exchange also plays a major role .",
    "in fact , the pion contribution is known to have an important role in hadronic leading proton @xcite and seems to work as an effective background for @xmath100 diffractive reactions at small @xmath30 @xcite , besides its role in dis @xcite .",

    "the only departure from these values comes from the global nlo fit with the interference parameter @xmath78 set free ( fit 5 ) .",
    "for that we have the diffractive data contributing with @xmath121 and the leading proton data with @xmath122 .",
    "it is worth to remember that , for the global fits , our data sample is composed of 218 data , 170 coming from diffractive and 48 from leading proton structure function .",

    "shows the @xmath130 data from h1 collaboration together with the results from fit  2 to illustrate the description of the leading particle behavior .",
    "the leading neutron data , from the same experiment , are also included ( these data can be described assuming pion exchange as the only contribution for the reaction and so were not employed in the fitting procedure ) .    after showing all of these results , some comments are in order .",
    "firstly , from fits 1 and 2 , we see that applying lo or nlo evolution equations produce basically the same result in terms of @xmath131 , although , as expected , some parameters suffer a little change ( the same can be said about fits 4 and 5 ) .",
    "we remind that these parameters reflect the quark and gluon content of the pomeron as obtained from different scenarios .",
    "the comparison between fit 2 ( global ) and fit 3 ( only diffractive data ) present much more remarkable effects .",
    "not only the parameters change , but in the latter case there is a strong enhancement of the secondary contribution .",
    "however , this is a suspicious effect since the diffractive data are quite limited in terms of the @xmath23 variable and secondary reggeon contribution are supposed to play an important role only for @xmath109 ( see more comments about this aspect in the next section ) .    when we perform the global fit , but leaving the interference term completely free to be established by the @xmath131 minimization , it assumes its maximum value ( fits 4 and 5 ) .",
    "again it is the case of asking whether this outcome reflects a reliable physical effect or is just a fitting artifact .",
    "answering this question is beyond the scope of this paper , but we have strong evidences indicating that the introduction of the interference term makes the corresponding structure functions inadequate to describe the results of diffractive photo- and eletroproduction of dijets by both h1 and zeus collaborations . on the other hand , diffractive structure function obtained without interference effects allow a very good description of both dijet production processes @xcite .",
    "now , some words are needed to explain how we handled together both the sets of data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , since it is the central piece of our study . in that figure",
    ", we bring together the diffractive and leading proton data and compare the results of our three nlo fits to this combined set of semi - inclusive data .    here , we are mostly interested in analyzing the behavior of these data in terms of @xmath23 .",
    "since the @xmath132 range for the diffractive and leading proton data are very distinct , the usual procedure of plotting together data with the same values of @xmath24 and @xmath7 would not be the best choice .",
    "there is , however , a large overlap of these two sets in terms of the variables @xmath40 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we choose to combine the data in groups with the same ( or as close as possible ) values of @xmath40 and @xmath7 .",
    "that is a more proper way to show that the difference between the diffractive and the leading proton regime is due to the @xmath23 region where the semi - inclusive process @xmath133 is measured , according to our assumption that both sets of data can be embraced by the same semi - inclusive structure function .",
    "still a problem remains . besides the different @xmath24 range , both the diffractive and leading proton structure functions were measured at different @xmath30 intervals .",
    "the diffractive data were measured for the interval @xmath134 , whereas the leading proton ones where measured for the interval @xmath135 , where @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "since this last interval corresponds to a range smaller than the diffractive one and since the phenomenological @xmath30 dependence coming from the diffractive region seems to be well established for both hadronic and dis events , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we scaled down the diffractive structure function data in order to make them comparable to the leading proton data .",
    "it should be noticed that such a correction is intended only as a visualization device . in our whole fitting analysis",
    ", we took the data at their correct measured @xmath30 intervals .    in order to make such a correction as independent of our own analysis as possible , we choose to proceed by the following way .",
    "a fit of eq .",
    "( [ f2d3 ] ) to the diffractive structure function data was performed , with the interference parameter @xmath78 set to zero ( no interference ) .",
    "the fluxes were those given by eq .",
    "( [ pomeron_flux ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ reggeon_flux ] ) , with the pomeron and reggeon intercept kept fixed with those values obtained from the h1 analysis @xcite ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively ) . for any fixed values of @xmath24 and @xmath7 , the pomeron and reggeon structure functions were treated as free parameters to be fixed .",
    "once those parameters were determined for each set , it was possible to calculate the ratio @xmath140 which should be used to correct each measured diffractive structure function data point at a given @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath7 .",
    "such procedure provided a correction factor that is a function of @xmath23 , going from 0.25 to 0.4 .",
    "this is reflected in the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . from that figure",
    "it is clear that the @xmath141 reggeon contribution coming from fit  3 overestimates the leading proton data by a factor 2 at least .",
    "the only parameter related to this exchange is the normalization @xmath96 , and from table  [ tablefit ] it is clear that the fit to the diffractive data alone drives such parameter to a very high value , compared with the one from the global fits 2 and 5 , that are both quite compatible with the combined sets of data .",
    "the analysis in this paper shows that we have to be very careful before drawing conclusions about the role of regge exchanges in diffractive dis .",
    "if only the h1 high statistic diffractive data were used , as we have done in our fit  3 , an extrapolation of such a result to the leading proton region will overestimate those data by , at least , a factor 2 ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it could be argued that such an extrapolation goes to low @xmath24 values beyond the range of the fitted data , and our pomeron structure function would not be valid anymore .",
    "that is true , but the point is that the pomeron contribution alone is not important in such extrapolation . it is the secondary reggeon plus the pion contribution that play the major role in the leading proton region .",
    "the pion contribution itself is fixed and provides a quite reasonable description of the leading neutron data .",
    "the same pion structure function is used by the reggeon exchange , and it has been shown that a such combination provides a good description of the leading baryon data @xcite .",
    "therefore our choice of structure functions for the secondary exchanges works well in both regimes , and it is fair to expect that , extrapolating the information about the ratio between pomeron and reggeon from the diffractive sf to the leading proton regime , we should be able to have a decent qualitative description of the leading proton data , but instead we were left with a result that not only does not describe the data , but also lives no room for corrections with extra reggeon exchanges .",
    "the main problem in connecting the diffractive and leading baryon regimes seems to come from the relative weight that the fit put over the reggeon contribution in each case .",
    "for instance , the normalization parameter @xmath96 changes from @xmath142 , when only diffractive data are used , to @xmath143 , when both diffractive and leading proton data are put together .",
    "although the interference term has some impact over the reggeon contribution , it plays a minor role that does not improve at all the discrepancies discussed above .",
    "the fact that zeus collab . has found no secondary exchange in their diffractive measurements @xcite is also an evidence that the diffractive structure function data alone can not conclusively provide information concerning the contribution of the secondary reggeon exchange in semi - inclusive @xmath12 reactions .",
    "therefore , the leading baryon data represent an important constraint that must be taken into account in any analysis based on the regge picture of diffraction .    the next step following this analysis is to show how these different parameterizations affect the theoretical predictions for the cross sections of diffractive photo- and electro - production of dijets , also measured by zeus and h1 collaborations @xcite .",
    "this is going to be reported in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
