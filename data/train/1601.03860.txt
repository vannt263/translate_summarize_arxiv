    "<S> manipulation of electronic states by laser pulses requires precise timing of the pulse sequence . </S>",
    "<S> a particular example is ultrafast coherent control of exciton complexes confined in semiconductor nanostructures @xcite which may be used for manipulating quantum states @xcite or even storing quantum information @xcite . for an inhomogeneous ensemble of two - level systems ( tls ) such as quantum dots ( qds ) </S>",
    "<S> the information retrieval induces echoes for the recovered signal  @xcite . to be of practical use </S>",
    "<S> , the echo formation time needs to be determined with high accuracy .    the scenario is well established when a weakly inhomogeneous ensemble of tls is resonantly addressed by ultrashort laser pulses whose spectrum covers the distribution of optical transitions in the ensemble . in this conventional picture of a photon echo ( pe ) </S>",
    "<S> , a first excitation pulse creates a macroscopic polarization which subsequently dephases due to inhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> a second subsequent optical rephasing pulse retrieves the macroscopic polarization @xcite with subsequent emission of a pe pulse delayed by a time exactly equal to the interval between the rephasing and excitation pulse , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> typically the temporal profile of the pe pulse has a gaussian shape reflecting the inhomogeneous frequency distribution of the excited ensemble .    in semiconductors </S>",
    "<S> this picture may be complicated by several features : ( 1 ) due to the many - body interactions a description by a distribution of independent tls is as a rule not appropriate , but complex coherent transients are recorded @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , localization of excitons strongly reduces exciton - exciton interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , qds with particularly strong three - dimensional localization can be often reasonably well considered as tls with long coherence times . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , rabi oscillations of exciton complexes were demonstrated in qds using various techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) in addition , fluctuations in qd size , shape and composition lead to a considerable inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions in qds . simultaneously excitation with ultrashort pulses having a broader spectrum than the inhomogeneity in many cases is prohibited because of the demand of addressing a specific optical transition . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively narrow energy spacing of different electronic excitations limits the spectral width that the laser pulses may have , to avoid excitation of multiple transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore a careful consideration of the optical frequency detuning with respect to the tls optical resonance is mandatory when considering the pe transient formation , even in the limit of small excitation levels . </S>",
    "<S> generally , it is expected that for strongly inhomogeneous tls ensembles the pe temporal profile may undergo significant distortion compared to the standard @xmath3 sequence , showing either retarded or advanced echo pulses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the non - negligible inhomogeneity - induced dephasing of oscillators during the optical excitation pulse , so that the finite pulse duration should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , these variations of the pe transients in tls were only reported in ruby @xcite , where the characteristic excitation and depolarization times are in the range of tens of nanoseconds , i.e. orders of magnitude longer than in semiconductor nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> so far , the pe transients in qds were considered in the conventional @xmath3 picture only .    </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting from the standpoint of applications is the non - linear regime , when the inhomogeneous system under study may be considered as an ensemble of two - level systems ( tls ) coherently driven by the optical field , so that even rabi oscillations can be observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this regime is characterized by the following relation for the saturation factor :    t_2 1 , [ satfactor ]    where @xmath4 is the rabi frequency expressed via laser pulse amplitude @xmath5 and transition dipole moment  @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the decoherence time of an individual oscillator , and @xmath8 is planck constant . during the process of optical excitation , coherent evolution of an individual oscillator from an ensemble with a gaussian distribution of frequencies @xmath9 with standard deviation @xmath10 directly depends on its detuning from the light frequency @xmath11 : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the oscillator frequency . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the generalized rabi frequency is defined by @xmath14 . while generalized rabi frequency increases with the detuning , the maximum possible population of the tls has the following dependence : , maximum possible population corresponds to the envelope function of population inversion @xmath15 . ]    w()=-1 . </S>",

    "<S> [ experimental_data ] . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath16 is significantly larger than the inhomogeneity parameter @xmath10 , detuning plays insufficient role , and emission of the pe pulse occurs precisely at @xmath17 by the analogy with the hahn echo @xcite , as shown in fig .  [ experimental_data](a ) . on the bloch sphere , in the reference frame rotating at the light frequency @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal drift due to detuning during the excitation is negligible . in the case , </S>",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of the pe from an ensemble of ( in , ga)as / gaas semiconductor qds excited by picosecond laser pulses . by varying the amplitude of the first excitation pulse we find a complex evolution of rabi oscillations in the amplitude of the pe , deviating strongly from the @xmath24 expectation . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we observe temporal shifts of the pe pulse relative to the expected pe arrival time . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the experimental results measured on excitons using a transparent analytical model .    </S>",
    "<S> the pe experiment was carried out on a sample with a single layer of ( in , ga)as qds which is inserted into a gaas @xmath25-microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> the qd density is about @xmath26 @xmath27 and the barrier contains a si @xmath10-layer with donor density @xmath28 @xmath27 , separated from the qd - layer by 10 nm . </S>",

    "<S> the photon lifetime is much shorter than the laser pulse duration of several picoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the main influence of the microcavity is to enhance the light - matter interaction for those qds with optical frequency in resonance with the cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> further , the broad exciton photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum from the qds with a width of 30  mev is convoluted with the relatively narrow photon cavity mode to result in a relatively narrow emission band with full - width of 6.5  mev . </S>",

    "<S> a degenerate transient four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) experiment was performed in reflection geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was placed into a helium bath cryostat and cooled down to a temperature of @xmath31  k. we used a tunable mode - locked ti : sa laser as source of the optical pulses with duration of about 2.5  ps and repetition rate of about 76 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> we implemented an interferometric heterodyne detection using a reference beam to detect the absolute value of the fwm amplitude with temporal resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation pulses were linearly cross - polarized resulting a linearly polarized pe signal.4-density matrix formalism in order to account for the linear polarizations as shown in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> it was checked , however , that the effect of the pe shifts demonstrated here is valid for any polarization configuration . ] a detailed description of the experimental technique can be found elsewhere @xcite .    in the experiment , </S>",

    "<S> clearly , footprints of rabi oscillations are observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ experimental_data](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> most strikingly , sizable temporal shifts of the pe maxima for @xmath0 and @xmath1-excitation pulses ( around 0.8 mw@xmath34 and 1.8 mw@xmath34 , respectively ) as well as a splitting of the pe profile around @xmath23-pulse amplitude ( around 1.3 mw@xmath34 ) become evident in fig .

    "<S> the time - integrated pe signal also manifests rabi oscillations , as seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ experimental_data](d ) , but the oscillations are much less pronounced than in the time - resolved data . </S>",
    "<S> note , that variation of the second pulse amplitude does not lead to any additional modification of the pe temporal profile .    in order to describe the pe from a qd ensemble we calculate the temporal evolution of a set of 2@xmath352 density matrices interacting with two sequent laser pulses and analyze the resulting macroscopic polarization of the medium , @xmath36 , given by the mean value of the dipole moment operator @xmath37 : p = tr ( ) . here , @xmath38 is the density matrix of the tls and @xmath39 is the trace of the matrix . </S>",

    "<S> we consider the case , when the individual oscillator coherence time @xmath43 , which is justified by @xmath7 being ultimately limited by the exciton lifetime of about 0.5  ns . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the only consequence of relaxation in the system is the pe exponential decay @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will neglect relaxation considering @xmath45 , for simplicity .    in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian consists of two parts : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 describes the unperturbed system and @xmath48 gives the interaction with light . </S>",
    "<S> we assume rectangular shaped pulses , each with with duration @xmath49 . during the optical excitation </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the ensemble dephasing due to the detuning of every individual oscillator with frequency @xmath13 from the light frequency @xmath11 : @xmath12 . in the rotating - wave approximation , this defines the optical nutation of the tls on the bloch sphere with a generalized rabi frequency @xmath14 , where @xmath50 is proportional to the optical field amplitude @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the analysis of the coherent optical response of the system includes the following steps : first , we calculate the interaction of the unperturbed system with the first excitation pulse ( @xmath51 ) acting during time @xmath49 , then the system evolves freely in absence of excitation ( @xmath52 ) during the time interval @xmath2 , followed by the excitation with the second rephasing pulse ( @xmath53 ) during time @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we analyze the macroscopic polarization of the qds that is available for pe pulse formation by integrating the individual responses over the inhomogeneous ensemble of tls , defined by a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath10 . within these approximations , it is possible to perform the analysis analytically and calculate the following expression for the modulus of the detected excitation - dependent part of the pe amplitude ( see appendix a containing details of the theoretical approach . ) :    @xmath54 d\\delta\\bigg| . \\label{pdet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the generalized rabi frequencies of the first and the second pulse , respectively . in this notation , </S>",
    "<S> delay between the exciting pulse centers used in experiment is @xmath57 and expected pe arrival time according to the standard treatment is @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation is similar to the one obtained for spin echoes measured in highly inhomogeneous fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily seen , that variation of the second , rephasing pulse amplitude and , hence , @xmath59 does not affect the symmetry of the pe profile . therefore , we will consider only the effect coming from variation of the first , excitation pulse amplitude </S>",

    "<S> ( [ pdet ] ) for two ensembles with different widths of the inhomogeneity : @xmath60 and 1.2 . for an ensemble broadening much narrower than the pulse spectrum , @xmath60 , </S>",
    "<S> clean rabi oscillations are seen in the pe temporal profile as function of the excitation pulse area @xmath62 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ simulations](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the photon echo arrives as expected at twice the separation between rephasing and excitation pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this case is equivalent to an ideal hahn echo , where the echo signal is generated at @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> when , however , the inhomogeneous ensemble width becomes comparable with the pulse spectral width ( @xmath61 ) , strong modifications of the temporal pe profile appear , as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ simulations](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of these modifications is the effective temporal shift of the pe amplitude that is particularly prominent for the first two maxima of the rabi oscillations when increasing the excitation power : for a @xmath0-pulse the pe maximum is retarded relative to the expected pe arrival time , while for a @xmath1-pulse the pe is advanced . </S>",

    "<S> the right panels show the temporal evolution of the modulus of the macroscopic polarization , @xmath65 , after excitation pulse action . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines denote extrapolation of @xmath65 to @xmath66 . ]    the temporal shifts of the pe can be qualitatively explained using the bloch sphere representation , as outlined in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ drift_explanation ] . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ drift_explanation](a ) , the ideal case of a hahn echo is given as a reference , where excitation with a negligibly short excitation @xmath0-pulse results in an unshifted echo signal . </S>",
    "<S> when the excitation pulse has a finite duration , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ drift_explanation](b ) , oscillators experience dephasing during pulse action , so that the excitation distributes the oscillators along the equator of the bloch sphere followed by their precession in the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> this precession extrapolated to negative times results in focusing all the bloch vectors on the same meridian , which corresponds to a situation where the maximum macroscopic polarization is shifted to @xmath66 . in case of excitation by a @xmath1-pulse as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ drift_explanation](c ) , after pulse action all oscillators proceed along the equator towards each other , which leads to a shift of the macroscopic polarization maximum to @xmath67 . since the rephasing pulse , which is not necessarily a @xmath23-pulse , acts essentially as a refocusing pulse , which in effect reverses the temporally coherent evolution of the ensemble oscillators , the dynamics of the macroscopic dipole moment around the expected echo arrival time , @xmath68 , is similar to a mirrored copy of its dynamics around the time @xmath69 , as shown by the right panels of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ drift_explanation ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the pe pulse is retarded for the a @xmath0-excitation pulse and advanced for a @xmath1-pulse , when the ensemble dephasing during pulse action is sufficiently strong . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved either by high inhomogeneity in the excited ensemble and/or long pulse duration .    the analysis of the experimental data in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this broadening is much smaller than the pl linewidth of the qd structure ( 6.5  mev ) indicating that a much narrower sub - ensemble contributes to the pe compared to the ensemble contributing to the pl emission . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this discrepancy will be subject of further studies </S>",
    "<S> . a possible reason might be the interaction with the microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> the evident rabi oscillations pattern in the pe sequence tells that qd structures under resonant excitation can be well described by tls .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the oscillator detuning from the optical frequency in forming the macroscopic coherent response in semiconductor qds was addressed in literature already before @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , no consequence of the timing of the associated pe had been reported . </S>",
    "<S> the essential consequence of our study is that even significantly inhomogeneous semiconductor systems still demonstrate a comprehensible coherent behavior , but great care needs to be exercised to consider the consequences of the inhomogeneity in detail . </S>",
    "<S> when doing so , such systems are very well suited candidates for the coherent manipulations in coherent optoelectronics . in particular , the observed temporal shifts of the pe amplitude need to be taken into account when a precise timing of the optical signals matters . </S>",
    "<S> our findings have strong impact on interpretation of two - dimensional fourier transform images , which are currently widely used because of their intuitive visualization of underlying physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complex - valued envelope of the pe - transients from strongly inhomogeneous systems results in a changeover of the corresponding 2d image from a resonance profile in case of a hahn echo to a dispersive profile ( see appendix b ) . </S>"
