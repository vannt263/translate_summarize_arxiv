    "the _ swift _ satellite @xcite certainly revolutionised the grb field , but it has also shaken some of our pre_swift _ strong beliefs .",
    "one of those was the reassuring division between the prompt and the afterglow phases understood in terms of internal shocks between relativistic shells followed by the external shock of the fireball with the circumburst medium .",
    "this scenario could well explain the erratic and violent prompt emission lasting up to a few tens of seconds , and most of the ( then existing ) observations of the afterglow , typically starting a few hours after the trigger .",
    "the afterglow phase was thought to be somewhat better understood , since it was constructed upon the very solid basis of the conservation of energy and momentum , shock acceleration physics and the synchrotron process as the main radiation mechanism ( that was even confirmed by the detection of a small , but significant , linear polarisation ; see @xcite for a recent review ) . although some problem remained to be solved for the prompt phase ( as the inherently low efficiency of internal shocks and the hardness of the observed spectra if the emission process is synchrotron by cooling electrons , @xcite ) ,",
    "the overall scenario was satisfying , especially after the discovery that long grbs were indeed associated with powerful supernovae , confirming that the central engine had to be an hyper  accreting stellar size black hole .",
    "the _ swift _ capability of a very fast slew allowed to explore the very early phases , soon discovering the unexpected  steep  flat  steep \" behaviour of the light ",
    "curve , especially in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "although interpreted in several ways ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) , none seems conclusive . the spectral slope does not change across the temporal break from the shallow to the normal decay phase , ruling out a changing spectral break as a viable explanation .",
    "an hydrodynamical or geometrical nature of the break is instead preferred .",
    "specific models often focused only on the x  ray behaviour , but there is another crucial information that can not be overlooked : _ the x  ray and optical light ",
    "curves often do not track one another _",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) , in a way that can not be accommodated by the standard external shock / fireball scenario .",
    "it is this remarkable characteristic that suggests that there must be two components contributing to the observed flux .",
    "[ f1 ] shows two examples of optical and x  ray afterglows , to illustrate the different behaviour of the optical and x  ray light  curves in grb 061126 , while they track one another in grb 060614 .",
    "we ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) then used a simple phenomenological 2component model ( briefly described in the following section ) to fit _ both _ the x  ray and optical light  curves of _ swift _ grbs with redshift and a well sampled optical light ",
    "curve , allowing to estimate the optical extinction due to dust in the host galaxies . as of march 2008",
    ", they amount to 33 grbs .",
    "the logic we follow is to see if with a minimum number of parameters we can fit the observed light  curves of these bursts .",
    "if so , we can find some hints for a more physical interpretation .",
    "we assume that at all times the flux is the sum of two components : a standard afterglow plus ( for the time being ) a completely phenomenological second component .    * component 1 : * this is the synchrotron radiation produced by the standard forward shock caused by the fireball running into the circum  burst material . for this component",
    "we follow the prescription of @xcite , that requires 6 free parameters , plus the assumption of an homogeneous or a wind  like profile of the circumburst density .",
    "these are : i ) the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy of the fireball @xmath1 ; ii ) its initial bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 ; iii ) the value of the circum  burst medium density @xmath3 ;",
    "iv)v ) the `` equipartition '' parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; vi ) the slope of the relativistic electron energy distribution @xmath6 .    *",
    "component 2 : * it is treated phenomenologically , since its form / origin is not currently known , though it can be possibly ascribed to the extension in time of the early prompt emission ( as discussed below ) .",
    "we parametrise this component with the only criterion of minimising the number of free parameters .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that its spectral shape is constant in time and is described by a broken power ",
    "law , with spectral indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 below and above the break frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the temporal parameters are described by the flat and steep decay indices , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , and the time @xmath12 at which the two behaviours join .",
    "the time @xmath12 is the time at which the shallow phase ( of the steep  flat ",
    "steep behaviour ) ends .",
    "then we have 3 spectral and 3 temporal parameters , and we must add one normalisation .",
    "component 2 is thus determined by 7 free parameters , that can be rather well constrained by observations when this component dominates the emission . in this case @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be directly determined , as well as one spectral index ( usually @xmath13 , since the late prompt emission is usually dominating in the x  ray range ) .",

    "are dominated by component 2 at late times in both bands , while the standard afterglow emission ( i.e. the synchrotron emission from the external shock ) is important only at very early times .",
    "the complex shape of the optical light  curve of grb 061126 is due to the emerging of component 2 at @xmath201000 s. the break at @xmath21 s has nothing to do with a jet break , but is the end of the shallow component ( i.e. it is @xmath12 , the time break of component 2 , see @xcite for more discussion ) .",
    "if this burst ( of known @xmath22 ) had to follow the  ghirlanda \" relation , then it should have a jet break a few days after trigger ( rest frame time ) as indicated by the vertical line .",
    "but at this time the emission is dominated by component 2 , _ thus the jet break is hidden , and can not be observed_. see also @xcite for more examples and discussion of this point . for grb 060614 the entire observed light  curves are dominated by component 2 : also in this burst the very prominent and _ achromatic _ break at @xmath2040,000 s ( rest frame ) has again nothing to do with a jet break , being associated to @xmath12 .",

    "similarly , we can see how the energy emitted by component 2 , approximated by @xmath27 , relates with @xmath14 .",

    "the most important results of our analysis is the found distribution of @xmath11 , the decay index of component 2 after @xmath12 . fig .",
    "[ f3 ] shows a clustering around @xmath28 .",
    "this value is equal to the time profile of the accretion rate of fallback material in supernovae ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and to the average decay of the x  ray flare luminosity , as analysed by @xcite .",
    "this is _ not _ the average observed decay slope : the x  ray light ",
    "curves are flatter than @xmath29 ( see fig . [ f4 ] ) , but this is due to the contribution , especially at early and late times , of the emission of the standard afterglow . the light",
    " curves of component 2 are indeed steeper , on average , than the total emission that reproduces the data .",
    "the fact that @xmath30 strongly suggests that component 2 can be interpreted as due to the late time accretion of fallback mass , namely material that failed to reach the escape velocity from the exploding progenitor star , and falls back .",
    "this can continue for weeks , enough to sustain late prompt emission even at very late times .",
    "furthermore , the fact that also x  ray flares follow a similar behaviour suggests that both x  ray flares and component 2 have a common origin , related to the accretion of the fallback material .",
    "the puzzling features of the early afterglow disclosed by _ swift _ have revealed an unforeseen complexity , difficult to explain in terms of the standard internal / external shock scenario .",
    "many alternatives have been proposed ( see the introduction of @xcite for a brief list of models and @xcite for a review ) , but only a few are able to explain a different behaviour of the optical and x  ray light  curves .",
    "uhm & beloborodov @xcite and genet , daigne & mochkovitch @xcite suggested that the x  ray plateau emission is not due to the forward , but to the reverse shock running into ejecta of relatively small ( and decreasing ) lorentz factors .",
    "the optical can instead be due to the standard emission of the forward shock .",
    "this scenario requires an appropriate @xmath31distribution of the ejecta , and also the suppression of the x  ray flux produced by the forward shock .",
    "we ( @xcite ) instead suggested that the plateau phase of the x  ray emission ( and sometimes even of the optical ) is due to a prolonged activity of the central engine ( see also @xcite ) , responsible for a `` late ",
    "prompt '' phase : after the early  standard \" prompt the central engine continues to produce for a long time ( i.e. days ) shells of progressively lower power and bulk lorentz factor .",
    "the dissipation process during this and the early phases occur at similar radii ( namely close to the transparency radius ) .",
    "the reason for the shallow decay phase , and for the break ending it , is that the @xmath31factors of the late shells are monotonically decreasing , allowing to see an increasing portion of the emitting surface , until all of it is visible .",
    "then the break occurs when @xmath32 , at @xmath12 .",
    "the shallow phase is then the result of a balance : the total emitted luminosity is decreasing ( with a decay slope @xmath11 ) , but for some time ( before @xmath12 ) the surface visible to us is increasing ( because of the decreasing @xmath31 ) .",
    "the combination of these two effects flattens the observed flux decay , that appears to be characterised by @xmath10 .",
    "after @xmath12 the entire emitting surface is visible , and we see the  real \" decay slope @xmath11 . with respect to other models ,",
    "late prompt \" scenario is very economic , since the total extra energy needed is a relatively small fraction of what used during the real prompt phase .",
    "finally , we would like to collect the different pieces of evidence found in these studies , to try to construct an heuristic simple scenario .",
    "let us assume that , following the death of a massive star , a rapidly spinning black hole is formed .",
    "the fast rotation of the equatorial material prevented it to immediately fall into the black hole .",
    "this material forms a very dense torus .",
    "viscosity and angular momentum conservation makes this torus to spread , and accretion takes place .",
    "this accretion phase corresponds to the real prompt emission , possibly mediated by the strong magnetic field formed in the vicinity of the black hole , making the blandford & znajek @xcite mechanism at work .",
    "the energy stored in a maximally spinning black hole of 2 solar masses , and that can be extracted , amounts to @xmath33 erg .",
    "we need only a few per cent of it .",
    "when the bulk of the dense torus has been accreted , there must be a discontinuity in the accretion rate , to explain the steep behaviour of the light ",
    "curve following the real prompt emission .",
    "this discontinuity could be associated to the transition from the end of the accretion of the material of the dense torus and the beginning of the accretion of the fallback material .",
    "after this transition phase accretion proceeds at a reduced rate : this phase is associated to fallback , with its typical time profile .",
    "a reduced accretion most likely corresponds to a reduced magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole , and so to a reduced capacity to extract the spin energy of the black hole .",
    "occasionally , however , fragmentation of the accreting material leads to temporary enhanced accretion , that we can associate to the x  ray flares .",
