    "a negative ( positive ) @xmath0 means that an infinitesimal phase difference shrinks ( grows ) on the average , resulting in synchronization ( desynchronization ) of the oscillators .    however , the lyapunov exponent alone is not sufficient in characterizing the whole coherence phenomena induced by the common impulses , because it is an average quantity over the entire limit cycle that characterizes only the local linear stability of the synchronized state .",
    "the phase difference generally does not monotonically decrease or increase over successive common impulses due to fluctuations in the expansion rates of the phase difference , which is determined by the precise form of the prcs .",

    "as an example of a limit - cycle oscillator , we employ the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) neural oscillator  @xcite driven by common poisson impulses and independent gaussian - white noises described by the following set of equations : @xmath105 here , parameters @xmath106 are fixed at @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and we use the parameter @xmath110 as a bifurcation parameter .",

    "we choose these values because the oscillator characteristics change in such a way as to show synchronized and desynchronized states for additive impulses , and stable 2-cluster states for linear multiplicative impulses .",
    "we set the mean interval between the impulses at @xmath123 .",
    "results similar to the following have been obtained using stuart - landau and moris - lecar oscillators .",
    "however , we restrict our discussion to the fitzhugh - nagumo model as it displays all of the salient features of interest .    in direct numerical simulations of eq .",

    "the rare but sudden disintegration of a pair of oscillators is possible if there are regions of the prc with positive local lyapunov exponent , but the relative separation of a pair remains largely static .",
    "however for @xmath135 , disintegration of a pair happens routinely , followed by a gradual reunion , and this cycle continues _",
    "ad infinitum_. these occasional sudden , large excursions from the synchronized state is generally known as modulational or on - off intermittency  @xcite , and is a characteristic behavior of a random multiplicative process , of which our system is an example .",

    "theoretical curves obtained using our frobenius - perron equation for the phase difference nicely fit the results of direct numerical simulations , which indicates that the approximations we have made so far are reasonable for the parameter values we use .",
    "it is readily apparent that if the synchronized state is stable , the synchronized peaks become taller and narrower as the diffusion is made smaller , while @xmath69 far away from the stable peaks become increasingly rare . on the other hand , if the synchronized state is unstable , the distribution for rare @xmath69 reaches a limiting value , while only the tip of the synchronized peak increases in height and the width of the peak remains constant .",
    "the distributions exhibit a power - law dependence near @xmath138 , a characteristic of random multiplicative processes  @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : clusters ] shows the same basic mechanism at work for the case with linear multiplicative impulses ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) , which exhibits symmetric 2-cluster states .",
    "the distribution , which is nicely fitted by the theoretical curve , has three peaks in this case , corresponding to the three possible phase differences in the 2-cluster states ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 represent the same phase difference ) . near each peak",
    ", the distribution exhibits power - law dependence as for the case of additive impulses .",
    "we have shown that common random impulses applied to a pair of uncoupled limit - cycle oscillators generally produce phase coherence .",
    "much existing work focuses on the self - organizing coherence brought about through coupled elements , so we would like to touch upon the similarities and differences between the coherence observable between coupled systems and uncoupled systems receiving a common random input . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a pair of identical oscillators .    sufficiently weak common random input to uncoupled oscillators always tend to stabilize the synchronized state at zero phase difference regardless of the shape of the prc .",

    "[ fig : synch ] , [ fig : desynch ] and [ fig : clusters ] .",
    "when the common input is stronger , the in - phase synchronized state @xmath138 can be unstable .",
    "we nevertheless observe that @xmath129 has a local maximum at @xmath138 as shown in fig . 3 for weakly unstable situations . for much stronger inputs , the prc can take highly irregular forms that contain many discontinuities or with many rapid , large amplitude oscillations",
    "it is then possible for @xmath129 to have a local minimum at @xmath138 .",
    "in contrast , for oscillators with weak mutual coupling , the in - phase synchronized state may either be stable or unstable depending on the shape of the prc and the interaction function between the oscillators .",
    "if the in - phase state is unstable , there would be no peak appearing at @xmath138 ; instead , a peak would be expected at some other @xmath146  @xcite .",
    "this illustrates the biggest difference between coherence in mutually coupled systems and uncoupled systems subject to common inputs . in coupled systems , it is possible to have a single stable phase - locked state with @xmath147 , while in uncoupled systems , this is not possible .",
    "one possible point of confusion that arises here may be our use of the terms `` stable '' and `` unstable '' .",
    "for uncoupled oscillators driven by common input , these terms represent _ statistical _ stability of the synchronized state .",
    "even if the synchronized state induced by common input is slightly unstable , distribution of the phase differences can still have a shallow maximum at zero phase difference .",
    "the vicinity of @xmath138 is an attractive region even if the synchronized state is weakly unstable .",
    "in contrast , these terms represent _ deterministic _ stability for coupled systems .",
    "if it is unstable , we never observe such a maximum even if independent noises are added .",
    "if the natural frequencies of the oscillators are different , the difference in phase coherence behavior will be more subtle . in this case ,",
    "a local extremum in @xmath129 at @xmath147 appears for two non - identical oscillators driven by common input , and may be a maximum or minimum depending on the degree of statistical stability or instability of the locked state ( data not shown ) . in weak mutually coupled systems ,",
    "the deterministic stability is once again dependent on the interaction function , and in addition , the magnitude of the difference of the natural frequencies .",
    "furthermore , combined effects of coupling and common input , which may be important in practical situations , will lead to more intriguing behavior .",
    "we have found an approximate method to calculate the steady - state probability distribution of the pair - wise phase difference in an ensemble of uncoupled oscillators receiving random impulses .",
    "the system is essentially a random multiplicative process , and as such shows modulational intermittent behavior and power - law dependence of the distribution near its peak .",
    "qualitative and quantitative features of the distributions have been found relating the results to the lyapunov exponents that characterized the stability of clustered states in earlier works  @xcite .",

    ", the common noise always stabilizes the synchronized state as long as an oscillator possesses a continuous phase sensitivity function .",
    "the oscillators form one or more synchronized clusters , depending on the degree of symmetry possessed by the system .",
    "by contrast , in the scenario studied in this paper , there is the further possibility that common impulses may destabilize the synchronized state , which can still quantitatively be analyzed within our theoretical framework based on the averaged frobenius - perron equation   near the peak is always @xmath148 for the infinitesimal gaussian - white drive , while it can take a range of values in the present impulsive drive . ] .    in this work",
    ", we considered a pair of identical oscillators subject to the same common impulses , and considered the diffusion in between received impulses as the effect of independent noises .",
    "our method can also be applicable if the natural frequency or the prc of the oscillators are slightly different .",
