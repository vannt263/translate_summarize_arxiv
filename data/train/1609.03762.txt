    "_ macro base station _",
    "( mbs ) is expected to provide wide coverage of users in the macro cell . meanwhile , a _ small - cell base station _ ( sbs ) in the macro cell coexists with the mbs and is responsible for providing high data rate services for the users in the small cell .",
    "an effective way to achieve the coexistence between the small cell and the macro cell is underlay hetnet @xcite , @xcite . in the underlay hetnet",
    ", the sbs is allowed to access the macro frequency band to enhance the small - cell throughput , provided that the interference from the sbs to a _ macro user _ ( mu ) is well controlled .    to implement an underlay hetnet ,",
    "the location information of the mu is important for the sbs to control its transmit power and manage the interference to the mu .",
    "intuitively , if the mu is out of the sbs s coverage , the sbs is allowed to maximize the transmit power and achieve a high small - cell throughput .",
    "otherwise , if the mu is in the sbs s coverage , the sbs has to carefully control the transmit power to avoid severe interference to the mu . to obtain the location information of the mu , the sbs needs a backhaul link from the macro system , such that the macro system is able to transmit the location information of the mu to the sbs through the backhaul link @xcite .",
    "however , there may not exist any backhaul link from the macro system to the sbs in practical situations .",
    "thus , it is challenging for the sbs to obtain the location information of the mu for the underlay hetnet .",
    "recently , the underlay hetnet has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "instead of utilizing the instantaneous location information of the mu to manage the interference , these literature exploited the stochastic geometry information of the mu and enabled the sbs to satisfy an average interference constraint .",
    "in particular , the _ poisson point process _ ( ppp ) model is widely adopted to enhance the access probability of the sbs , while guaranteeing a small outage probability of the mu . however",
    ", this approach can only provide limited access probability of the sbs and compromises the small - cell throughput .    to deal with this issue",
    ", we intend to estimate the distance between the mbs and the mu , such that the sbs can exploit the distance to achieve the underlay hetnet . briefly ,",
    "if the distance is too small or too large compared with the the distance between the mbs and the sbs , the sbs s transmission will not interfere with the mu since the mu is almost surely beyond the sbs s coverage in this case . if the distance between the mbs and the mu is comparable with the distance between the mbs and the sbs , the sbs has to carefully control its transmit power to avoid severe interference to the mu since it is likely that the mu is in the sbs s coverage .",
    "in fact , it is possible for the sbs to obtain the distance between the mbs and the mu without any backhaul link from the macro system . in principle , if the mbs is transmitting data to the mu with a target snr , the transmitted signal is designed based on the distance between the mbs and the mu . in particular , if the distance is small , the mbs is able to satisfy the target snr with a small transmit power",
    ". otherwise , the mbs increases its transmit power to achieve the target snr .",
    "in other words , the transmitted signal from the mbs contains some information of the distance between the mbs and the mu .",
    "thus , the sbs can estimate the distance by sensing the transmitted signal from the mbs .    in this paper",
    ", we first study the relation between the mbs signal and the distance from the mbs to the mu . with this relation",
    ", we enable the sbs to sense the mbs signal and develop a _ median based _ ( mb ) estimator to obtain the distance .",
    "numerical results show that the estimation error of the mb estimator can be as small as @xmath0 .",
    "fig . [ systemmodel ] provides a hetnet model , which consists of a mbs , a mu , and a sbs .",
    "in particular , the mbs is transmitting data to the mu .",
    "meanwhile , the sbs intends to estimate the distance @xmath1 between the mbs and the mu for the underlay hetnet . in what follows ,",
    "we present the channel model and the signal model , respectively .     between the mbs and the mu to achieve the underlay hetnet .",
    "]      we denote @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) as the fading , the shadowing , and the path - loss coefficients between the mbs and the mu ( sbs ) , respectively .",
    "then , the channel between the mbs and the mu ( sbs ) is @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . in particular",

    "@xmath14 ( @xmath11 ) is determined by the path - loss model .",
    "if we adopt the path - loss model @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance between two transceivers , @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath17    for illustrations , we provide the channel model in fig .",

    "if the mbs transmits the signal with power @xmath23 , the received signal at the mu is @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the index of the @xmath18th block , @xmath26 represents the index of the @xmath27th subblock in the @xmath18th block , @xmath28 represents the awgn at the mu with zero mean and variance @xmath29 . then , the snr of the received signal at the mu is @xmath30    we further consider that the mbs and the mu adopt _ close loop power control _ ( clpc ) to provide qos guaranteed wireless communication @xcite .",
    "that is , the mbs automatically adjusts its transmit power to meet a certain target snr @xmath31 at the mu . then , mbs s transmit power is @xmath32      in the meantime , the received mbs signal at the sbs is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the awgn at the sbs with zero mean and variance @xmath29 .",
    "then , the snr of the received mbs signal at the sbs is @xmath35    by substituting ( [ g_i ] ) and ( [ p_0 ] ) into ( [ gamma_c ] ) , @xmath36 in ( [ gamma_c ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath37",
    "in this section , we will develop a mb estimator to obtain the distance @xmath1 between the mbs and the mu . in what follows",
    ", we provide the basic principle of the estimator followed by the estimator design .      from ( [ gamma_c_1 ] ) , each snr of the received mbs signal at the sbs is highly related to the distance @xmath1 .",
    "then , it is possible for the sbs to measure the snr of the received mbs signal and estimate @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is difficult to obtain @xmath1 directly .",
    "this is because , each snr is also affected by random rayleigh fadings and shadowing attenuations , and varies independently among different blocks and/or subblocks .",
    "alternatively , the sbs can measure different snrs of mbs signals in multiple blocks and utilize the distribution knowledge of the rayleigh fadings and shadowing attenuations to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "next , we will first calculate the _ cumulative density function _ ( cdf ) of the snr at the sbs .",
    "then , we study the relation between the cdf of the snr at the sbs and the distance @xmath1 . finally , we develop the mb estimator .      removing the time index of the snr at the sbs in ( [ gamma_c_1 ] ) and rewriting the snr in db",

    "on one hand , both @xmath44 amd @xmath45 follow a rayleigh distribution with unit mean , the cdf of @xmath46 is @xcite @xmath47    then , the cdf of @xmath48 is @xmath49    substituting ( [ phi_cdf ] ) into ( [ theta_r_cdf ] ) , we have the cdf of @xmath41 as @xmath50    taking the derivation of @xmath51 , we have the pdf of @xmath41 as @xmath52    on the other hand , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 follow a log - normal distribution with variance @xmath13 . then , it is straightforward to obtain that @xmath53 follows a normal distribution with zero means and variance @xmath54 .",

    "then , the median of @xmath56 can be approximated as @xmath96    by substituting ( [ approximate_even ] ) into ( [ median_2 ] ) , we have the mb estimator as @xmath97    consequently , the mb estimator can be summarized as @xmath98 from ( [ mb_estimator ] ) , the mb estimator @xmath99 is determined by the target snr @xmath100 at the mu , the distance @xmath101 between the mbs and the sbs , and the snr @xmath56 of the mbs signal at the sbs .",
