    "this is an article in mathematics , specifically in set theory .",
    "set theory is a part of mathematical logic and it indeed has a dual role , that of giving logical foundations to mathematics , and that of being a part of mathematics itself . in many people s minds these two roles are rather distinct . in fact",
    "much of the development of set theory in the twentieth century ran on two distinct tracks . on the one hand",
    ", much effort was spent to develop systems of set - theoretic axioms from which one could logically develop the known mathematics .",
    "hilbert s programme made it a priority to have such a system , and it had been widely believed after cantor ( see e.g cantor ( 1874 ) ) developed set theory , in the late nineteenth century , that one should be able to have an axiomatic system for mathematics by using the notion of a set as given .",
    "the present understanding of this is rather different , due mostly to the work of gdel ( 1931 ) in his famous incompleteness theorems .",
    "firstly he showed that for every consistent recursive system of axioms which includes the peano arithmetic there is a statement formalizable in the theory itself which is independent ( not provable nor unprovable ) in the theory , and secondly that such systems of axioms also can not prove their own consistency . on the other hand ,",
    "much understanding was developed about the mathematical , rather than logical , consequences of cantor s work .",
    "this includes the idea of infinite sets of various sizes and the understanding of what this means in terms of familiar objects , such as the sets of reals .",
    "this article will mainly concentrate on that , mathematical , side of set theory , but in fact the point is that the two sides of set theory are indivisible , as we wish to demonstrate by this article .",
    "most ( but not all ) of modern mathematics takes as a basis the axiom scheme known as zfc , zermelo - fraenkel axioms with choice .",
    "it has been the case basically since the 1920s and there are many good reasons for this decision .",
    "some then may view it as a serious setback that it became known since cohen ( 1963 ) that not only that as we know from gdel ( 1931 ) , there are some statements of mathematics that are independent of zfc , but that there are some ordinary statements , notably the continuum hypothesis ( ` there is no infinite subset of the set @xmath2 of real numbers which is not in a bijective correspondence with either the set @xmath3 of natural numbers or the set @xmath2 itself ' ) that are independent .",
    "this was established by showing that one can not calculate just by using the axioms of zfc the size @xmath4 in terms of the cantor s @xmath5_-hierarchy _ of infinite cardinals : @xmath6 , the next infinite cardinal @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 the limit @xmath10 , the next @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with these axioms ( assuming they themselves are consistent ) that the value of @xmath12 is as large as desired , i.e. no upper bound can be found just by arguing in zfc . indeed , cohen s result changed the subject of set theory entirely , not only because of its logical significance but also because it introduced a method for proving that various statements were independent of zfc .",
    "this is the method of forcing .",
    "many interesting results have been obtained by applying this method . whilst this is exciting",
    ", it also created the feeling in the general mathematical community that set - theorists are mostly concerned about things that can not be done , rather than the ones that can .",
    "it did not help that the forcing machinery has developed to an incredible extent and even being able to read and verify some of the proofs takes an enormous effort .",
    "there definitely was a period in which set theory was considered far removed from the interests of the main stream mathematics .",
    "i am very fortunate to belong to the generation of mathematicians who have now seen the pendulum swing the other way . in recent years",
    "there have been a number of purely mathematical results that have been obtained as a consequence of a fine set - theoretic analysis of the problem .",
    "the final result often does not mention any set - theoretic assumptions additional to zfc , which is assumed throughout , yet the proof relays deeply on an understanding of the set - theoretic limits of zfc and its possible universes . as an example , let us state a celebrated theorem of shelah ( 1994 ) :    ( shelah ) if @xmath13 , then @xmath14 .    to appreciate the impact of the above theorem , contrast it with what we have already said : it is not possible to bound @xmath12 by arguing in zfc . however , if we are in the situation to know that this value is less than @xmath10 then we can put a definite bound on the size of @xmath15 .",
    "this theorem as stated can be understood without any prior knowledge of set theory . yet",
    ", this statement is a culmination of at least twenty years of concentrated effort by many set theorists , involving techniques such as large cardinals , iterated forcing , elementary embeddings , and culminating by the seminal work of shelah ( 1994 ) in which he invented the whole theory ( ` pcf ' , the theory of possible cofinalities ) to finally prove the theorem .",
    "this part of shelah s work was what was cited when he was awarded the prestigious bolyai prize .",
    "in this article we shall concentrate on the appearance of this phenomenon of the symbiosis between the axiomatic and the mathematical in the context of measure theory .",
    "we shall describe the problem of characterizing boolean algebras that carry a measure , and point out the most well known instance of this problem .",
    "this is of course the von neumann problem ( see von neumann ( 1981 ) ) , recently solved in the negative by talagrand ( 2006 ) .",
    "we shall then consider some other instances of this problem and show some recent solutions that have been obtained in our joint work damonja & plebanek ( 2006 ) .",
    "in order to make the article accessible we shall commence with a quick review of the basic notions we shall use .",
    "a list of notational conventions can be found at the end of the article .",
    "a boolean algebra @xmath0 is a structure consisting of a set with at least two distinct elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 , two binary operations , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and a unary operation @xmath20 , which obeys certain rules known as the laws of boolean algebras .",
    "a typical example of a boolean algebra is a family of subsets of a given set @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the operations @xmath24 and @xmath20 are interpreted as @xmath25 and the complement @xmath26 respectively .",
    "it follows from stone representation theorem ( stone ( 1936 ) ) that every boolean algebra is isomorphic as a structure to some @xmath27 for some @xmath21 , so we shall only work with such algebras .",
    "the basic laws of boolean algebras are then interpreted as the familiar commutativity , associativity and distributivity laws between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and we also have that for any @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "these operations induce the familiar subset relation @xmath32 , which acts as a relation of partial ordering on @xmath0 .",
    "two elements @xmath33 of @xmath0 are said to be _ incomparable _ if @xmath34 .",
    "boolean algebras @xmath0 may also have properties additional to the ones given by the basic laws .",
    "for example , we can consider the _",
    "antichains _ , which are subsets of @xmath0 consisting of pairwise incomparable ( i.e. disjoint ) elements .",
    "the condition that guarantees that all antichains in @xmath0 are countable is called _ the countable ( anti)chain condition _ and abbreviated as _",
    "ccc_. an example of a boolean algebra that satisfies this law is the family @xmath35 of the equivalence classes ( mod .",
    "measure 0 ) of all lebesgue measurable subsets of the unit interval @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "this is easily seen and is due to the additivity properties of the lebesgue measure @xmath37 .",
    "it is known ( see fremlin ( 1989 ) ) that one can choose the representatives @xmath38 of the equivalence classes of measurable sets @xmath39 so that @xmath40 and the representative of @xmath41 is the union ( intersection ) of the corresponding representatives , for all @xmath42 .",
    "( for this reason we omit @xmath43 in our notation ) .",
    "another property of @xmath35 is that for every sequence @xmath44 in @xmath35 the union @xmath45 is an element of @xmath35 , and it is the least upper bound of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "boolean algebras with this property are said to be @xmath46-_complete_. in fact , the analogous completeness property remains true for sequences indexed by any other ordinal but @xmath47 , which can be proved by using the ccc property along with the @xmath46-completeness . this property is called _ completeness _ , and since in this article we never deal with algebras that are @xmath46-complete without being complete , we shall simplify the notation and refer to both concepts by the word ` complete ' .    notice that in the above example @xmath37 induces a function on @xmath35 , which is again called @xmath37 , and that this function satisfies the following , for all @xmath48 :    \\(i ) ( strict positivity ) @xmath49 , @xmath50 ,    ( ii@xmath51 ) ( total finiteness ) @xmath52 ,    \\(iii ) ( additivity ) if @xmath33 are disjoint then @xmath53 , moreover    ( iii@xmath54 ) ( countable additivity ) if @xmath44 are pairwise disjoint , then @xmath55 .    a boolean algebra @xmath0 which supports a functional @xmath37 satisfying properties ( i ) , ( ii)@xmath56 and ( iii)@xmath54 above",
    "is called a _ measure algebra _ and @xmath37",
    "is called a _ strictly positive ( s.p . )",
    "countably additive measure_. measures which only satisfy properties ( i ) , ( ii)@xmath56 and ( iii ) are called _ s.p .",
    "finitely additive measures_. since it is clear that by multiplying by a constant we can obtain from @xmath37 another countably additive measure @xmath57 which satisfies @xmath58 ( such measures are called _ probabilities _ ) , we can replace the requirement ( ii)@xmath56 in the definition of a measure algebra by the one requiring the relevant measure to be a probability . in the sequel",
    "the word ` measure ' will refer to finitely additive measures .",
    "the general problem we shall discuss in this paper is the following :    * measure recognition problem * mrp(@xmath59 given a boolean algebra @xmath0 and a property @xmath1 of measures .",
    "how can we recognize by purely combinatorial means if on @xmath0 one can define a strictly positive measure with property @xmath1 ?",
    "the most well known instance of the measure recognition problem was asked by von neumann in 1937 ( see von neumann ( 1981 ) ) .",
    "he was interested in recognizing measure algebras ( so the additional property @xmath1 in the problem description is the property of countable additivity and we are dealing with mrp(countably additive ) ) .",
    "in addition to the completeness and the ccc property von neumann isolated another property which is always present in measure algebras , called weak distributivity , and asked if these three properties together were sufficient for a boolean algebra to be a measure algebra .",
    "this famous problem was answered only very recently by talagrand ( 2006 ) , and the answer is negative .",
    "in fact , the main result of talagrand ( 2006 ) answered , also negatively , the related well known control measure problem , which asks if the existence of a so called continuos submeasure on boolean algebra implies the existence of a measure . the step from this solution to the solution of von neumann s problem then followed by known work , as explained in talagrand s paper .",
    "a ( strictly positive ) continuos submeasure is a finite nonnegative function @xmath57 on a boolean algebra @xmath0 , vanishing only at @xmath16 , having the ` submeasure ' property that @xmath60 for all @xmath61 , and the ` continuity ' property that for any sequence @xmath44 of elements of @xmath0 satisfying @xmath62 for all @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 .",
    "the result of talagrand ( 2006 ) is probably the most exciting recent result to come out of a whole variety of mathematical subjects , particularly measure theory and set theory .",
    "the notion of a continuous submeasure comes from the work of maharam ( 1947 ) who observed that a necessary condition for a boolean algebra to be a measure algebra is to be metrizable , and showed how one can define a continuos submeasure from the appropriate metric . following this work",
    "an important question became to recognize boolean algebras that support continuous submeasures , the so called maharam s algebras .",
    "recently it was proved in balcar _",
    "( 2005 ) and velikovi ( 2005 ) that under a certain set - theoretic axiom known as the p - ideal dichotomy , any ccc weakly distributive complete boolean algebra is a maharam algebra . using their work as a starting point todorevi ( 2004 ) obtained the following interesting characterization :    ( todorevi ) a complete boolean algebra carries a strictly positive continuous submeasure if and only if it is weakly distributive and satisfies the @xmath46-finite chain condition .",
    "the chain condition here means that the algebra can be written as a countable union of subsets each of which only has finite antichains .",
    "todorevi s result is clearly a theorem of zfc , but it was obtained as a consequence of a set - theoretic analysis of the situation under the p - ideal dichotomy , and the methods introduced in maharam ( 1947 ) .",
    "likewise , talagrand s result is a theorem of zfc but even the formulation by maharam of the control measure problem was a consequence of her analysis of the behaviour of the von neumann s problem under the set - theoretic assumption of the existence of a souslin tree .",
    "both of these results illustrate the point that this article makes , about the close connection between a set - theoretic analysis of a problem and its solution in zfc , as well as the long - term view that one has had to take in understanding various specific instances of this connection .",
    "next let us take a look at another special case of mrp , namely mrp(@xmath66 ) , the situation when we do not require any special property @xmath1 . in this case",
    "there is a combinatorial criterion due to kelley ( 1959 ) .",
    "it involves the notion of the _ intersection number _ of a family @xmath67 of sets , which is defined to be the supremum of all @xmath68 such that for every finite subsequence @xmath69 of elements of @xmath67 ( with possible repetitions of elements ) , there is a subsequence @xmath70 of length @xmath71 at least @xmath72 , such that the intersection of all elements of @xmath70 is non - empty .",
    "kelley s criterion is then :    ( kelley ) a boolean algebra @xmath0 carries a strictly positive ( finitely additive ) measure if and only if @xmath73 can be written as a countable union of families each of which has positive intersection number .",
    "one may wonder how strong the condition in the kelley s criterion is .",
    "it clearly implies the ccc , but gaifman ( 1964 ) proved that there are ccc algebras that do not satisfy kelley s criterion .",
    "it is also known that under the set - theoretic statement known as martin s axiom ma and the negation of the continuum hypothesis ch , all ccc boolean algebras of size @xmath74 do satisfy kelley s condition and in fact some stronger conditions ( see fremlin ( 1984 ) ) .",
    "this together with the example of the p - ideal dichotomy results quoted above demonstrates that there are some mathematical axioms which make it easier for a boolean algebra to have certain measure - theoretic properties .",
    "we shall see another example of this behaviour in ",
    "once the notion of the intersection number is known , the proof of kelley s theorem follows rather readily by the well known facts from functional analysis .",
    "it seems to be a tendency in this subject that positive theorems once formulated properly , have proofs that are much less involved than the proofs of the negative ones .",
    "we shall illustrate this in theorem [ baanonatomic ] , where we shall give a proof of one such positive theorem , while we may note that most of the negative statements mentioned here ( for example the construction from talagrand ( 2006 ) ) have proofs that are very much out of the scope of this paper .",
    "special cases of property @xmath1 which are particularly interesting are the notions of nonatomicity and separability . to motivate the definitions we shall go back to the case of countably additive measures .",
    "an example of such a measure is the familiar lebesgue measure @xmath37 on the unit interval .",
    "this measure naturally leads to a measure on the tychonoff product @xmath36^\\kappa$ ] for any cardinal @xmath75 , denoted by @xmath76 .",
    "a remarkable theorem of maharam ( 1942 ) shows that the structure of measure algebras ( so supporting a countably additive measure ) is totally determined by these examples .",
    "namely , any measure algebra can be decomposed into a countable union of subsets , each of which is either an atom , or a boolean algebra isomorphic to the measure algebra @xmath77 of some @xmath36^\\kappa$ ] under @xmath76 , where all @xmath75 are infinite cardinals . here",
    "we use the notion of an _ atom _ of a boolean algebra @xmath0 , which is an element @xmath78 such that only @xmath79 in @xmath0 are @xmath66 and @xmath80 .",
    "such a structure theorem does not exist for boolean algebras that simply support a strictly positive finitely additive measure .",
    "maharam ( 1981 ) writes : ` it would be very interesting to have a structure theory for finitely additive measures , the structures of which can be much more complicated ( than those of measure algebras ) . '",
    "taking a long term goal to obtain such a structure theory for finitely additive measures , we may ask ourselves what the first step would be . in the case of countably additive measures that was to determine the relevant building blocks , namely the algebras @xmath81 .",
    "each of these blocks has two important properties .",
    "the first one is that the measure is _ nonatomic _ which means that for every @xmath82 there is a finite partition of the algebra into elements of measure @xmath83 .",
    "for this reason we wish to have a combinatorial criterion for recognizing when a boolean algebra has a finitely additive measure which is nonatomic , which explains why we believe the case of mrp(nonatomic ) is an important special case . in our recent work damonja & plebanek ( 2006 )",
    "we obtained a simple solution to this problem , which will be presented in ",
    "[ new ] .",
    "another property of measure algebras @xmath81 for @xmath84 is that they can be understood as metric spaces of density @xmath75 .",
    "namely one introduces a metric @xmath85 derived from @xmath76 by declaring @xmath86 , and this metric has the required property . by maharam",
    "s theorem mentioned above , every measure algebra @xmath0 has a ( unique ) decomposition involving algebras @xmath77 for some @xmath75 , and the supremum of all @xmath75 involved in this composition is called _ maharam s dimension _ or _ type _ of @xmath0 .",
    "hence it would be of interest to have a similar notion for boolean algebras which simply support a finitely additive strictly positive measure .",
    "the notion of type can be defined similarly to the above because a finitely additive strictly positive measure on @xmath0 will already induce a metric on @xmath0 , and we can define the _ type _ of @xmath0 to be the supremum of all densities of metric spaces obtained from @xmath0 by using all possible strictly positive measures on @xmath0 . in the same vein , for a fixed measure @xmath57 on @xmath0 we may consider the density of the induced metric space . in particular we say that @xmath57 is _ separable _ if the induced metric space is separable in the topological sense ( i.e. it has a countable dense subset ) . recognizing boolean algebras that have such a strictly positive measure translates in the context of mrp into mrp(separable ) .",
    "clearly , a similar notion can be defined for any fixed possible densities of a metric space , but for the moment we still do not know how to solve mrp(separable ) .",
    "we shall show some partial solutions in  [ new ] .",
    "in this section we shall take for granted all notions defined in previous sections . here",
    "we concentrate on mrp with two specific values of @xmath1 in mind , mrp(nonatomic ) and mrp(separable ) .",
    "all otherwise unattributed theorems are from damonja & plebanek ( 2006 ) .",
    "this work in particular solves the problem mrp(nonatomic ) mentioned above , using a rather simple argument .",
    "we present the argument here :    [ baanonatomic ] a boolean algebra @xmath0 carries a strictly positive nonatomic measure if and only if there is a decomposition @xmath87 , where for each @xmath63 we have    * @xmath88 ; * @xmath89 ; * if @xmath90 then there are disjoint @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "the forward direction of this theorem is easy modulo known facts .",
    "namely , one uses the well known stone duality theory between boolean algebras and compact zerodimensional topological spaces , stone ( 1936 ) and its application to measures to transfer the problem into the setting of radon measures on compact spaces .",
    "the conclusion then follows by another well known theorem , maharam ( 1942 ) .",
    "details are not practical to explain here .",
    "we shall however sketch the proof of the backward direction of the theorem , assuming the following lemma which appears as part of kelley s proof in kelley ( 1964 ) and os taken in this form from fremlin ( 2002 ) , proposition 391 i. the notation @xmath93 stands for the intersection number of the family @xmath21 .",
    "[ int ] ( kelley ) let @xmath94 be a boolean algebra and @xmath95 nonempty .",
    "then @xmath96 where the maximum is taken over all probability ( finitely additive ) measures on @xmath94 .",
    "if there is a decomposition of @xmath0 satisfying ( i)(iii ) then by fact [ int ] for each @xmath63 we can define a probability measure @xmath97 on @xmath0 such that for all @xmath98 we have @xmath99 .",
    "we let @xmath57 be any cluster point of the sequence @xmath100 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath57 is a probability measure on @xmath0 .",
    "let us show that @xmath57 is strictly positive .",
    "by induction on @xmath63 it easily follows that for all @xmath101 and @xmath102 there are @xmath103 pairwise disjoint sets in @xmath104 contained in @xmath80 .",
    "hence for such @xmath105 we have @xmath106 . consequently , @xmath107 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath108 and @xmath109 are given .",
    "let @xmath110 be large enough so that @xmath111 and @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath112 be disjoint elements of @xmath104 contained in @xmath80 , which exist as shown in the previous paragraph .",
    "then @xmath113 for all @xmath114 , again by the argument in the previous paragraph , and hence @xmath115= 1 - 2^{n}+2^{-k}<\\varepsilon$ ] .",
    "this shows that every nonzero element of @xmath0 has a subset of positive measure less than @xmath116 , which easily implies nonatomicity .",
    "an essential difference between this criterion and other combinatorial criteria we mentioned above ( maharam , kelley , todorevi ) , is that the decomposition of the boolean algebra involves an interaction between the countably many pieces involved .",
    "next , one may wonder how strong this criterion is .",
    "obviously , a necessary condition on the boolean algebra to support a nonatomic strictly positive measure is first of all that it supports any strictly positive measure , so kelley s criterion , and secondly that the algebra itself is _ atomless _ which means that it does not have any atoms in the sense defined in  [ knownres ] .",
    "damonja & plebanek ( 2006 ) give an example showing that in general these conditions are not sufficient to show that the algebra supports a nonatomic strictly positive measure . as it is known that under the axioms ma without ch various properties of boolean algebras of size smaller than @xmath117 tend to be equivalent , the following theorem is perhaps not surprising :    [ chaincond ]",
    "assume ma and the negation of ch",
    ". then for atomless boolean algebras @xmath118 of size @xmath74 , the following are equivalent    \\(i ) @xmath118 is ccc , and    \\(ii ) @xmath118 satisfies the condition from theorem [ baanonatomic ] .    what may be surprising is the way that the theorem is proved .",
    "we give an informal sketch , for which we need several notions .",
    "this will also be a good opportunity to introduce an auxiliary property of boolean algebras which was central in damonja & plebanek ( 2006 ) , the so called approximability .",
    "a _ forcing notion _ is a partially ordered set @xmath119 with the least element .",
    "two elements of @xmath119 are _ incompatible _ if there is no element of @xmath119 that is larger than both of them .",
    "we say that @xmath119 is _ ccc _ if there is no uncountable family of pairwise incompatible elements ( note that this is a different notion than that of ccc in boolean algebras ) .",
    "a subset of @xmath119 is a _ filter _ if it is directed and downward closed as a partial order .",
    "a subset @xmath120 of @xmath119 is _ dense _ if for every @xmath121 there is @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "ma states that for any ccc forcing @xmath119 and any family @xmath67 of @xmath74 dense subsets of @xmath119 , there is a filter of @xmath119 which intersects each of the dense sets in the family . in applications one may start with a goal of constructing some object , usually of size @xmath124 ( which is why the negation of ch is assumed as well ) , and @xmath119 consisting of ( usually ) finite pieces of the desired object , ordered so that a stronger element of @xmath119 gives more information about the object than a weaker one .",
    "then one need to formulate a family @xmath67 of dense sets which represent various requirements on the object constructed , and the @xmath67-generic filter guaranteed to exist by ma will in some natural way give rise to the object desired .    in the context of theorem [ chaincond ] , in the nontrivial direction from ( i ) to ( ii ) and in view of characterization from theorem [ baanonatomic ] , it would be natural to start with a boolean algebra @xmath0 which satisfies ccc and has size @xmath74 , and to formulate a ccc forcing notion which would force a nonatomic strictly positive measure on @xmath0",
    ". one would need to formulate a dense set corresponding to the requirement that @xmath80 has positive measure , for every nonzero @xmath80 in @xmath0 .",
    "this is maybe possible , but this is not how our proof goes . also ,",
    "the known proof that every ccc boolean algebra of size @xmath74 is separable and hence satisfies kelley s condition and carries a measure ( see fremlin ( 1984 ) ) , is not useful since it gives an atomic measure .",
    "we worked instead with the notion of approximability . a boolean algebra",
    "@xmath0 is _ approximable _ if there is a sequence @xmath125 of probability measures on @xmath0 such that for every @xmath126 in @xmath0 there is @xmath63 such that @xmath127 .",
    "this notion was studied by talagrand ( 1980 ) and mgerl & namioka ( 1980 ) with the idea of characterizing boolean algebras that support a strictly positive separable measure .",
    "we shall discuss this in a moment , but for now let us finish sketching the proof of theorem [ chaincond ] .",
    "the proof is to start with a boolean algebra that satisfies kelley s condition ( in fact a weaker condition than that ) and formulate a ccc forcing notion whose generic filter gives a sequence @xmath125 which demonstrates that the algebra is approximable .",
    "the size of the family @xmath67 of sets such that we need to produce an @xmath67-generic filter is equal to the size of @xmath0 , so if ma and not ch holds we can deal with any ccc algebra of size @xmath74 . having the sequence @xmath125 we can define the weighted sum @xmath128 , and the proof is done in such a way that if the algebra is atomless then this measure in nonatomic .",
    "having sketched the proof of theorem [ chaincond ] we can discuss the next item on our list , namely the notion of separable measures defined above .",
    "talagrand ( 1980 ) attacks mrp(separable ) by defining a list of properties of decreasing strength one of which is ` supporting a strictly positive separable measure ' ( sm ) .",
    "he shows that the property of @xmath0 being _ @xmath46-centred _",
    "( so the algebra can be written as a countable union of subfamilies each of which has the property that for all finite subsets @xmath129 we have @xmath130 , provided @xmath131 ) is strictly stronger than sm , while sm implies approximability .",
    "he also shows that under the assumption of ch , property sm is strictly stronger than approximability .",
    "there is a possibility left open by this theorem , which is that approximability might under some suitable axioms actually characterize sm .",
    "damonja & plebanek ( 2006 ) show that this is not the case :    [ grz ] there is a boolean algebra which is approximable but does not support a strictly positive separable measure .",
    "proof of this theorem involves a combinatorial construction the details of which are out of the scope of this paper .",
    "a major building block is a zerodimensional topological space without isolated points with the curios property that it has a countable dense set @xmath120 such that for every sequence @xmath132 of closed sets whose union is disjoint from @xmath120 , that union is nowhere dense .",
    "such a space was first constructed in zfc by simon ( 2002 ) , although it was known before that such spaces can exist under various additional axioms of set theory .",
    "just as talagrand ( 2006 ) by answering negatively the problem of von neumann brings us back to square one regarding mrp(countably additive ) , so does theorem [ grz ] brings us back to the beginning regarding mrp(separable ) .",
    "it would have been very nice if at least consistently there would be an equivalence between approximability and separability , since there is a combinatorial characterization of approximability due to mgerl & namioka ( 1980 ) :    [ baapproximable ] ( mgerl - namioka ) a boolean algebra @xmath0 is approximable if and only if for every @xmath108 ( equivalently : for some @xmath133 there is a decomposition @xmath134 , where for each @xmath63 we have @xmath135 .    in the absence of such an equivalence we have to rethink what a possible characterization may look like . at this point",
    "we may say that it is likely that any characterization will involve not only a decomposition into countably many pieces each of which has some given property , in the style of all but one characterization given here . instead",
    ", the desired theorem will probably have to take into account the interaction between these various pieces , like in theorem [ baanonatomic ] .",
    "the reason for this is a result by dow & steprans ( 1993 ) .",
    "namely , one of the strongest possible characterizations involving only the information about each of the countably many pieces ( given that we know that @xmath46-centredness is too strong ) , would use the notion of _",
    "@xmath136-linkedness_. for a given @xmath63 , a family @xmath21 of nonempty sets is @xmath63-linked if for any subset @xmath129 of @xmath21 of size @xmath137 , we have @xmath138 .",
    "a boolean algebra is _ @xmath136-linked _ if it can be written as a countable union of sets each of which is either @xmath139 or @xmath63-linked .",
    "dow & steprans ( 1993 ) proved that the measure algebra of @xmath36^\\kappa$ ] is @xmath136-linked for every @xmath63 if and only if @xmath140 .",
    "this shows that the notion of @xmath136-linkedness does not make a sufficient distinction between separable measure algebras and those of type @xmath141 , and it is easily seen using stone s duality ( from stone ( 1936 ) ) that the measure algebra of @xmath36^\\kappa$ ] does not support a strictly positive separable measure for @xmath142 .",
    "the article shows on the specific example of the measure recognition problem the phenomenon of the utility of a multidisciplinary mathematical approach to a single mathematical problem , in particular the value of a set - theoretic analysis of the problem at hand .",
    "we have shown how mrp , which is a problem about boolean algebras that was asked first at least in 1937 if not earlier , has had an impact of measure theory , combinatorics and set theory , and in turn that each these subjects contributed to a better understanding of mrp . specifically , we discussed the set - theoretic insights and emphasized the point of using set - theoretic tools and being able to obtain a purely measure - theoretic or algebraic final result . through historical remarks presented in the first parts of the paper",
    "the reader can see how various results have followed the current state of knowledge , both in set theory and measure theory . in the final section we showed some new results and underlined the future directions of research in the subject .",
    "one of the goals is a structure theory for boolean algebras that support a finitely additive strictly positive measure .",
    "the _ power set _ of a given set @xmath21 is the set of all subsets of @xmath21 and is denoted by @xmath143 .",
    "the set - theoretic notation @xmath144 is used for what some authors denote by @xmath145 or ( after a reenumeration ) @xmath146 . our notation for sequences is @xmath44 in place of @xmath147 .",
    "a similar convention is used for @xmath148 ."
