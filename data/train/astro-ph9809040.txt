    "ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ; with luminosities [ 81000@xmath0 m ] in excess of @xmath1 ) are the most luminous galaxies in the local universe .",
    "they are believed to be powered by massive bursts of star formation that are induced by violent galaxy - galaxy collisions ( genzel et al .",
    "this `` interaction - activity connection '' and the corresponding physical processes seen in ulirgs locally are believed to have been more prevalent at high redshift  thus perhaps explaining the quasar phenomenon and maybe even galaxy formation itself ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ; and references therein ) .",
    "we are obtaining high - resolution images of ulirgs with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "such images are probing for the first time the fine - scale structure in the strong collision - disturbed morphologies of these rare and exotic galaxies ( borne et al .  1997a , b , c , d ) .",
    "the significance of ulirgs is underscored by their relevance to galaxy formation , star formation , galaxy evolution , and the ir background , as evidenced by their prominence within the overall science missions of iso , wire , sirtf , and ngst ( e.g. , bushouse et al .",
    "their significance has been further highlighted recently by the apparent resolution of @xmath230 - 50% of the ir background in the submillimeter with scuba and the subsequent identification of those sources with high - redshift ulirgs ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al .  1998 ) .",
    "we are carrying out a thorough survey and analysis of hst imaging data on ulirgs , including nearly 120 @xmath3-band and over 30 @xmath4-band images .",
    "all our observations were obtained as part of hst snapshot survey programs .",
    "we selected objects from the bright samples of sanders et al .",
    "( 1988a , b ) and melnick & mirabel ( 1990 ) , and from the qdot sample ( leech  et al .",
    "1994 ; lawrence  et al . , in press ) .",
    "the wfpc2 images were obtained with the @xmath3-band filter ( f814w at 8000a ) , with galaxies typically centered in the wf3 chip ( 800x800 pixels , at 0.1@xmath5/pixel ) .",
    "the nicmos exposures were obtained with the @xmath4-band filter ( f160w at 1.6@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the images were spiral - dithered in ` multiaccum ' mode , with galaxies centered in the nic2 camera fov ( 256x256 pixels , at 0.075@xmath5/pixel ) .",
    "we show representative results from our wfpc2 imaging sample in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "each of the 120 ulirgs that we have imaged with wfpc2 falls into one of the classes that are represented by these six examples . _",
    " in nearly all ulirgs , massive star formation is seen on all scales in the hst images , including super star clusters of the type seen in hst images of other colliding galaxies , indicating that a giant starburst is the dominant power source in most ulirgs .",
    "_ top middle _  a star  like nucleus is seen in 10% of the ulirgs , for which the dominant power source may be a dust  enshrouded agn / qso . _",
    "top right _  several of the galaxies show clear evidence in hst images for a ring around the central nucleus , very similar to rings seen in hst images around the centers of other ` black hole'powered galaxies",
    ". _ lower left _ ",
    "there is evidence for at least one classical collisional ring galaxy in the sample , similar to the cartwheel ring galaxy imaged by us with hst .",
    "_ lower middle _  some ulirgs previously classified as non - interacting from ground - based images now show in hst images clear evidence of merging ( a second nucleus ) or of interaction ( e.g. , tidal tails ) .",
    "_ lower right _",
    " many ulirgs appear to have physically associated companions , perhaps related to the collision , merger , and subsequent starburst .",
    "we are using our multiple - waveband data set to derive wavelength dependencies in the morphologies of ulirgs , hence measuring the spatial variations and effects of dust , star formation , and stellar population within these highly disturbed galaxies .",
    "we present some preliminary comparisons between the nicmos and wfpc2 images here for several ulirgs ( listed in table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "a representative example ( ir11095 - 0238 ) is displayed in figure  [ figure2 ] .",
