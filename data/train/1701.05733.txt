    "turbulence in superfluids , often named quantum turbulence , is a very active area of current research @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanical constraints require that only vortices of quantized circulation can exist in an otherwise irrotational flow @xcite . in the limit of very low temperature when almost all thermal excitations are frozen out , turbulence in a pure superfluid",
    "is considered to be the most simple paradigm of a difficult subject .",
    "this applies to superfluid @xmath0he at millikelvin temperatures , to superfluid @xmath7he in the microkelvin regime , and to bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) at nanokelvin temperatures .",
    "the method to generate vorticity that leads to turbulence in the form of a vortex tangle is to move an object through the superfluid , or to rotate it . in superfluid helium",
    "using oscillating objects like spheres , wires , grids or tuning forks is the easiest way to study the transition from potential flow to turbulence at some critical velocity amplitude . for recent reviews",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "new techniques are now available to obtain more information of the turbulent state , like improved electronics @xcite and visualization by means of particle image velocimetry ( piv ) @xcite .    in case of a bec",
    "the moving object is typically a laser beam that presents an obstacle to the condensate , and thus may lead to vortex shedding above a critical velocity at which the beam is moved repeatedly or back and forth through the condensate .",
    "this phenomenon , that was theoretically predicted and observed by several groups , is related to our experiments in the dense bose liquid of superfluid @xmath0he , as will be shown below .    as mentioned above , quantum turbulence",
    "can also be investigated by rotating the superfluids .",
    "although this technique will not be discussed in the following , interesting review articles can be found in @xcite for bec , and @xcite for the helium liquids .    in our present article",
    "we review and summarize our earlier experimental and theoretical results from experiments with an oscillating microsphere immersed in superfluid @xmath0he at temperatures down to 25 mk . the experimental technique ( for details , see appendix a ) makes use of superconducting levitation of a ferromagnetic sphere ( radius @xmath8 = 124 @xmath9 m , mass @xmath10 = 27@xmath9 g ) between superconducting niobium electrodes of a horizontal parallel plate capacitor ( spacing @xmath11 = 1 mm ) . before cooling the capacitor into the superconducting state ( for nb at 9.2",
    "k ) , we apply several hundred volts to the bottom electrode charging the sphere to about @xmath12 1 pc .",
    "vertical oscillations around the equilibrium position of the levitating sphere can be excited by applying an ac voltage @xmath13 at resonance ( @xmath14 120 hz ) in the range from 0.1 mv to several volts , exerting on the sphere a driving force @xmath15 .",
    "the oscillations induce an ac current @xmath16 that is detected by an electrometer .",
    "because no mechanical support is needed , the sphere moves at a well - defined velocity in contrast to wires , grids or tuning forks , where the velocity changes from zero at the mechanical support to some maximum value at the center of the wire or at the tip of the fork .",
    "moreover , the simple spherical geometry makes the data transparent and more directly accessible in a quantitative way , in particular the laminar and the turbulent drag forces on the sphere can be identified quantitatively , in contrast to the complicated geometry of the other oscillating objects . + potential flow and the transition to turbulent flow at a sharp critical velocity @xmath1 can be easily identified due to the very different drag forces .",
    "most interestingly , in a small interval of velocities @xmath17 above @xmath1 where @xmath5 , we observe an instability of the flow pattern switching intermittently between phases of potential flow and turbulent flow .",
    "an investigation of this phenomenon leads to detailed information on the stabibility of the turbulent state and allows an interesting comparison with vortex shedding in a bec . +",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section 2 the results for stable potential flow and stable turbulent flow will be presented ; in section 3 we review our results for the critical velocity .",
    "the central part of the article is the intermittent switching phenomenon discussed in section 4 : in subsection 4.1 the stability of the phases of potential flow is discussed ; in subsection 4.2 the lifetimes of the turbulent phases are analyzed ; in subsection 4.3 vortex shedding from the sphere is compared with experiments of other authors obtained by moving a laser beam through a bec ; in subsection 4.4 we find from a recent definition of a superfluid reynolds number that the transition to turbulence in our experiments is a new example of `` supertransient '' chaos .",
    "after the final summary , we present experimental details in appendix a. some peculiar results obtained with dilute @xmath7he -@xmath0he mixtures are described in appendix b.",
    "at a fixed temperature @xmath18 we measure the velocity amplitude as a function of the amplitude of the driving force @xmath19 at resonance frequency .",
    "( details of the determination of the resonance frequency are described in appendix a. ) as an example , the data at @xmath18 = 300 mk are shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "we identify three different regimes : a linear rise of @xmath19 at small driving forces up to a critical velocity ; a nonlinear increase at larger drives ; and the shaded region in between where the flow pattern is unstable , switching between both patterns @xcite . in the following",
    "we will discuss these regimes in detail .",
    "the linear regime at small velocities indicates potential flow with a small linear drag force @xmath20 that , because of the @xmath21 temperature dependence of @xmath22 , we attribute to ballistic phonon scattering , whereby @xmath23 where the phonon density @xmath24 rapidly varies as @xmath21 , and @xmath25 is the velocity of sound .",
    "there might be a numerical factor of order one in eq .",
    ", depending on the details of the phonon scattering ( specular or diffuse ) .",
    "because the wavelength of a thermal phonon in helium at 0.1 k is about 0.1 @xmath9 m which is much smaller than the size of the sphere and likely also of the surface roughness , we expect both a geometric cross section and a diffuse scattering , but we are not aware of a calculation of the prefactor .",
    "we are assuming that it will be of order 1 . using the value of the radius @xmath26 m as determined",
    "optically , we obtain a perfect quantitative agreement with the data if we set this factor equal to one , see fig.[fig:2 ] . at temperatures below ca .",
    "100 mk , the phonon drag falls below the background damping measured in vacuum . at temperatures above 1 k ,",
    "the drag force is described by stokes solution extended to the two - fluid model @xcite .     of the laminar phase .",
    "the solid line is calculated for ballistic quasiparticle scattering . at the lower temperatures it follows a @xmath21 law due to phonon scattering ,",
    "see eq .. also note that the drag is larger near 0.7 k than at 0.9 k where the transition to the hydrodynamic regime begins .",
    "a background damping of @xmath27kg / s measured in vacuum has been subtracted.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we use this linear regime to determine the charge @xmath28 of the sphere .",
    "when a stable amplitude is reached at resonance , the drag force @xmath29 and driving force @xmath30 cancel . from the slope @xmath31 of the induced current @xmath32 as a function of @xmath13 , and from the time constant of the freely decaying amplitude @xmath33 measured separately at the same temperature ,",
    "we obtain the charge ( the mass @xmath10 and the spacing @xmath11 are known , see above ) .",
    "we apply this procedure at @xmath34 where @xmath35 has a convenient value of @xmath36 . during the course of the experiment",
    ", we find the charge to remain constant , and occasionally a small loss of few percent can be observed after several weeks .",
    "the nonlinear dependence of @xmath19 in fig.[fig:1 ] and fig.[fig:3 ] can be properly described by a quadratic drag force .",
    "in contrast to a classical liquid , the apex of the parabolic shape of @xmath19 is shifted to the left of the origin by 0.4 nn , and the resulting finite intercept at @xmath30 = 0 indicates a velocity range of frictionless flow which is the paradigm of superfluidity .",
    "moreover , we observe a sharp onset of the turbulent regime , whereas in a classical liquid there are about three orders of magnitude in flow velocity between stokes regime of laminar flow and fully developed turbulence , where the classical drag on a sphere is given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the density of the liquid and the drag coefficient @xmath40 of a sphere is approximately 0.4 ) .    , see eq ..",
    ",scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for a quantitative analysis of the data , we have to take into account the following considerations .",
    "for oscillatory flow subject to a quadratic drag force , the concept of energy balance requires that per half - period the power injected by the drive and dissipation due to the drag must cancel for a stable oscillation amplitude . in the case of a linear drag",
    ", this leads to the simple result that the equilibrium amplitude is reached when driving force and drag force cancel , see above .",
    "but in the case of a quadratic drag of the form    @xmath41    that is obviously appropriate here , a short calculation gives for the driving force @xcite    @xmath42    there are 2 corrections , firstly a factor 8/3@xmath43 0.85 , and secondly , an intercept for @xmath44 at @xmath45 = 3/2 @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the intercept velocity is larger than @xmath47 by a factor @xmath48 . before fitting eq . to the data , the linear drag ( phonons and background ) ,",
    "see eq . , must be subtracted .",
    "if we parametrize @xmath49 like in the classical case , i.e. , @xmath50 , the only fitting parameter is the drag coefficient @xmath40 in @xmath51 .",
    "we find @xmath52 0.40 to within 10 % .",
    "hence , surprisingly , the expressions of @xmath51 for oscillatory superflow and for classical uniform flow are identical . we",
    "define _ the critical velocity @xmath1 as the largest velocity at @xmath30 = 0 , i.e. , @xmath53 , which can be obtained either from the intercept in fig.[fig:4 ] , or directly from the kink in the @xmath19 curve , see fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "+     = 0.36 .",
    "the intercept at @xmath44 occurs at @xmath54 5.0 ( cm / s)@xmath55 .",
    "the background damping of the empty cell has been subtracted , phonon drag is negligible at 33 mk .",
    "( color figure online),scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "when the velocity amplitude is increased beyond a certain value , the linear regime abruptly changes to a nonlinear regime at lower amplitude .",
    "this signals the transition to a large turbulent drag force that is followed by a hysteresis with the down sweep , see fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "= 46 mm / s can only be determined with the down sweep .",
    "the oscillation frequency was 236hz .",
    "( color figure online),scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we interpret the hysteretic behavior as follows . at the beginning of the first up - sweeps there are few remanent vortices left from the first cool - down .",
    "potential flow will break down when the oscillating sphere collides with such a vortex and then sheds more vortices .",
    "in fact , detailed experiments with vibrating wires , e.g. , by the osaka group , demonstrate that remanent vorticity can be reduced , or even avoided , if the measuring cell is filled very slowly at low temperatures @xcite . in that case , no transition to turbulence was observable up to very high velocity amplitudes of 1.5 m / s .",
    "obviously , the wire does not shed vortices by itself .",
    "we expect the same scenario to occur in our case . from fig.[fig:5 ]",
    "the velocity at initial breakdown is @xmath56 = 82 mm / s and the critical velocity is @xmath1 = 46 mm / s .",
    "we may infer the intervortex spacing @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the remanent vortex density ( defined as the length of all vortices per unit volume , having a dimension 1/m@xmath55 ) by postulating that the critical oscillation amplitude is determined by the spacing of the remanent vortices , i.e. , @xmath59 we find a ratio of 0.56 for the spacings and hence a ratio @xmath60 = 0.31 . if for some reason @xmath58 were too large , a too small @xmath1 would be measured .",
    "this and the hysteresis must be taken into account when determining @xmath1 .",
    "we now turn to dependence of @xmath1 on the oscillation frequency @xmath61 .",
    "empirically we find a scaling of @xmath1 as @xmath2 , see fig.[fig:6 ] , in agreement with results obtained with a vibrating wire at osaka @xcite and with a tuning fork at lancaster @xcite .",
    "on dimensional grounds this leads to @xmath62 . because there is still no rigorous theory available the numerical prefactor",
    "must be determined from the experiment . in our case",
    ", we find from fig.[fig:6 ] @xmath63 + the other authors , working with vibrating wires or tuning forks , find slightly different numerical prefactors , both are a little smaller but also of order 1 .",
    "the shape of the oscillating object might have an effect .",
    "for example , sharp corners strongly increase the velocity locally , making the prefactor smaller .",
    "m ; blue dots : 100@xmath64 m ; black line : calculated from eq .. there is a large scatter of the data near 200 hz that might be caused by some unusual remanent vorticity .",
    "( color figure online),scaledwidth=75.0% ]    although we have no theory for oscillating superfluid flow , there are several arguments that make the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath1 plausible @xcite .",
    "firstly , starting from the superfluid reynolds number @xmath65 1 for the onset of turbulence , and choosing the oscillation amplitude as the characteristic length scale @xmath66 we obtain @xmath67 .",
    "this is a qualitative , but very general argument .",
    "note that the size @xmath8 of the oscillating object is irrelevant here in contrast to the feynman critical velocity for uniform motion @xmath68 , where the size is the relevant length scale @xmath69 .",
    "secondly , making use of results obtained by kopnin @xcite based on the well known vinen equation for uniform motion , a relaxation time @xmath70 of the vortex tangle after a change of the superfluid flow velocity @xmath71 has been calculated :    @xmath72    here the numerical parameter @xmath73 = a(1 - @xmath74 ) - b@xmath75 is determined by the coefficients of mutual friction @xmath74 and @xmath75 and the constants a , b @xmath76 1 . applying this to oscillatory flow ( which remains to be proven valid ) ,",
    "we take the time the velocity changes from zero to the maximum , i.e. , one quarter of a period , in which the vortex tangle can follow and thus arrive at the condition @xmath77 and therefore we have    @xmath78     + to compare eq . with the experimental data we evaluate @xmath73 for @xmath0he by referring to tabulated values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite . setting the constants a , b = 1 , we find @xmath73 = 0.95 ( at 1.3k ) , 0.89 ( at 1.6k ) , and 0.79 ( at 1.9k ) .",
    "below 1k mutual friction is very small , hence we set @xmath81 .",
    "this implies a slow increase of @xmath1 by about 10% in qualitative agreement with experimental results as displayed in fig.[fig:7 ] .",
    "closer to the @xmath82-point , the critical velocity could not be identified accurately any more because there was no sharp onset of turbulence detectable in the @xmath19 curves .",
    ", e.g. , in a double - logarithmic plot , indicates a velocity above which the turbulent drag dominates the linear drag , but not the _ onset _ of turbulent drag , hence not @xmath1 that actually could be much smaller @xcite . ]",
    "is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "( color figure online),scaledwidth=80.0% ]    at present , the most accurate theoretical support of the @xmath83 dependence of @xmath1 comes from a dynamical scaling of the critical velocity @xcite . instead of presenting here all details of this approach",
    ", we only outline the following concept .",
    "the equation of motion of a vortex filament was shown by schwarz @xcite to be invariant when scaling the length @xmath84 , the velocity @xmath85 , and the time @xmath86 .",
    "this result was extended to oscillatory motion by kotsubo and swift @xcite by recognizing that the frequency @xmath87 is a scaling variable .",
    "the final result , that is exact to within a small logarithmic correction of about 4% in our frequency range @xmath88 7 , is    @xmath89     + it is quite clear that the @xmath83 dependence of @xmath1 can not remain valid when the frequency approaches zero for uniform motion , because a finite critical velocity is known to exist in that case too .",
    "we are suggesting that the relevant length scale in this case is the size @xmath8 of the sphere .",
    "thus , as shown above , we recover the feynman critical velocity @xmath90 = 0.5 mm / s .",
    "the transition to steady flow will occur when @xmath91 , that is at @xmath92 = 6.5 s@xmath93 , which is much smaller than our oscillation frequencies ( @xmath94 700 s@xmath93 ) , see fig.[fig:8 ] . for much smaller objects this will matter .     from oscillatory flow to steady flow @xmath95 at @xmath92 .",
    "( color figure online),scaledwidth=70.0% ]    finally , we should mention that with our experimental method , we have no quantitative control of the resonance frequency of the sphere .",
    "it depends on the state of levitation , in particular on how much flux is trapped in the superconducting electrodes .",
    "a more rapid cool down in our @xmath7he cryostat in general produced higher frequencies than in our dilution cryostat .",
    "below @xmath96 the hysteretic regime discussed in the previous section is replaced by an instability where neither potential flow nor turbulence are stable , but instead the flow switches intermittently between both patterns ( shaded area in fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the unstable regime extends from the critical velocity @xmath1 up to @xmath97 where @xmath98 3% .",
    "it is plausible that stable turbulence can not exist exactly at @xmath1 , because in the limit @xmath99 no power is available at vanishing drive to create vorticity",
    ".     corresponds to turbulent flow while the increase occurs during a laminar phase . with",
    "increasing drive the lifetimes of the laminar phases become shorter , whereas the lifetimes of turbulent phases grow rapidly .",
    "the time interval shown here extends over 1000 s @xmath100 17 min.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we have recorded time series ( lasting up to 36 hours ) of this switching phenomenon at various constant driving forces and temperatures , see fig.[fig:9 ] , for three different driving forces at @xmath101",
    ". the amplitude switches between a low level @xmath102 corresponding to turbulent drag and an exponential recovery of the laminar level corresponding to phonon scattering . because the velocity amplitudes are above @xmath1 , these phases of potential flow break down at some velocity @xmath103 .",
    "if the laminar phase lasts long enough , the stationary value for laminar flow @xmath104 is reached ( see upper time series ) .",
    "when the laminar flow breaks down , a rapid drop to the turbulent level occurs due to the onset of the large and nonlinear drag .",
    "it is obvious from fig.[fig:9 ] , that with increasing driving force the lifetimes of the laminar phases become shorter and those of the turbulent phases grow very rapidly . in the following",
    "we analyze these time series statistically .",
    "the statistical properties of the laminar phases @xcite can be analyzed either from the distribution of the signal height @xmath105 ( velocity at breakdown minus turbulent velocity @xmath102 ) , or by considering the distribution of the lifetimes .",
    "both variables are related by the exponential recovery of the laminar amplitude ( starting at @xmath106 ) @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the difference between the stationary laminar velocity amplitude @xmath109 and @xmath102 , and @xmath110 is the time constant .     of the velocity increase @xmath111 above the turbulent level .",
    "b ) the fitting parameter @xmath112 is shown to be independent of temperature and driving force @xmath113 , i.e. , linear drag force subtracted.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in fig.[fig:10]a the distribution of the signal height @xmath111 is shown to be of the gaussian form @xmath114 where @xmath112 is a fitting parameter .",
    "the distribution function describes the probability @xmath115 that a given @xmath111 is exceeded (  reliability function \" ) . in our case , it is the so - called rayleigh distribution , and the fitting parameter @xmath116 ( resonance frequency 120 hz ) is found to be completely independent of both temperature and driving force , see fig.[fig:10]b .",
    "it is a property of the rayleigh distribution that @xmath112 is the rms value of the distribution .    from the rayleigh distribution we obtain the failure rate @xmath117 which is the conditional probability that the potential flow decays in a small interval just above @xmath111 ,",
    "provided it has not decayed until @xmath111 :    @xmath118    we note that the failure rate is proportional to @xmath111 , and hence , to the increase of the oscillation amplitude @xmath119 .",
    "this fits into our picture that a collision of the sphere with remanent vortices will cause a breakdown of the potential flow , see fig.[fig:5 ] , where the breakdown at @xmath103 is related to the intervortex spacing @xmath120 of the remanent vortex density .",
    "another property of the failure rate can be found when changing the variable from @xmath111 to the lifetime @xmath121 of the potential flow :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is given by eq .. initially we have a linear increase of @xmath123 and therefore @xmath124 . at a time @xmath121 =",
    "@xmath125 the failure rate has a maximum . and , if the maximum level @xmath108 is approached for large @xmath121 , we find @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the flow becomes stable , although the velocity @xmath104 is clearly above @xmath1 .",
    "these metastable states of potential flow above @xmath1 will also break down after a mean lifetime of 25 min , because natural radioactivity produces vorticity in the fluid .",
    "this is proven by placing a weak radioactive source @xmath127 ( activity of @xmath128 = 2 @xmath9ci ) near the cryostat , resulting in a dramatic effect : the mean lifetime of the laminar phase is reduced to 3.0 minutes , see fig.[fig:11 ] .    .",
    "for times @xmath129 ( at 300 mk ) a mean lifetime of 25 minutes is measured .",
    "the additional radioactive source reduces the mean lifetime to 3.0 minutes .",
    "( color figure online),scaledwidth=75.0% ]    we have measured the dose rate of the source at the position of the measuring cell inside the cryostat ( taking into account a measured 20% loss in the dewar walls ) to be 440ngy / h ( @xmath1305% ) . comparing this value with the measured dose rate due to natural background radiation in our laboratory of 57.6 ( @xmath130 1.5)ngy / h , we obtain an increase of the dose rate due to the source by a factor of @xmath131 . within the error bars this compares well with the measured reduction of the mean lifetime of the laminar phases by a factor of @xmath132 .",
    "the effect of the radioactivity is attributed to the creation of he ions in the superfluid , which produce local vorticity either during the creation and recombination processes , or when the ions are accelerated by the electric field which exists in our measuring cell .",
    "this vorticity then triggers the breakdown of the potential flow when the velocity amplitude of the sphere reaches the corresponding critical velocity @xmath56 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the lifetime of the metastable laminar phases which we observe above @xmath1 is limited only by natural background radioactivity . + below 100",

    "finally , only the first term will dominate , i.e. , we may neglect damping and approach the case of an undamped oscillator :    @xmath140    the rms lifetime @xmath141 of the potential flow is then proportional to @xmath142 : @xmath143 and the failure rate , eq .",

    "however , the data point at 212 hz is the mean of 14 individual @xmath112 data measured at different temperatures ( 28 mk and 300 mk ) and 11 different driving forces , and therefore can not simply be neglected .",
    "a theoretical interpretation is not possible as long as a theory of the transition to turbulence in oscillating superflows is not available .",
    "however , a strong support of this frequency dependence of @xmath112 comes from the failure rate eq .. in that case , it follows that @xmath148 , i.e. , the failure rate is proportional to the number of the completed cycles .",
    "this appears to be plausible .",
    "the analysis of our data allows us to obtain informations concerning the properties of the unstable phases of potential flow above the critical velocity .",

    ", the stability of the phases of potential flow when @xmath104 is reached ( see upper trace in fig.[fig:9 ] ) leads us to assume that in this case the intervortex spacing @xmath57 of the remanent vorticity @xmath58 can not be reached by the sphere : @xmath149 40 @xmath9 m ( less than half of the radius of the sphere ) .",

    "this means that on the average 56 % of the vortex density at @xmath1 have survived the breakdown of the turbulent phase . but",
    "as long as the value @xmath158 is unknown for oscillatory flow , we can not determine absolute values of the vortex densities .",
    "also , since our sphere radius @xmath8 may be larger than the intervortex distance @xmath120 , it is rather peculiar that the transition to turbulence is not triggered by the vortices likely to be attached to the sphere .",

    "vortex shedding frequencies were not an issue in that work but an estimate of the characteristic frequency @xmath218 gives a value of about 100 s@xmath93 which is of the same order of the rotation frequency , decomposed into 2 linear oscillations .",
    "therefore , the flow regime was probably near the steady limit .",

    "summarizing our experiments with the oscillating sphere in superfluid @xmath0he we conclude , that we have a fairly good understanding of the flow in the various regimes .",
