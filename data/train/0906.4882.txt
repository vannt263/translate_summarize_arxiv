    "powered by accretion , supposedly onto a supermassive black hole , quasars ( active galactic nuclei , agn ) are long known mostly as highly energetic , exotic objects in the hearts of the galaxies . not until recently was their key role in galaxy evolution realized , revealed mostly as a strong correlation between the properties of the central black hole and that of the host galaxy ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "studying quasars , therefore , is not only important to understand the underlying physics ; it can also help to shed some light on the strange interplay between the accreting matter from the host and outflows from the center , which ultimately shape both  the black hole and the galaxy .",
    "although a general picture of the structure of a typical quasar seems to be widely accepted ( e.g. elvis 2000 ; see also krolik 1999 ) , there are still many details in this picture that are not fully understood .",
    "many of the problems to be solved concern agn continuum variability  a rather common property , observed in practically all energy bands .",
    "its universality indicates perhaps that variability should be an intrinsic property of the processes , responsible for continuum generation .",
    "the optical / uv to x - ray part of the continuum spectrum , as typically assumed , originates from an accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole .",
    "generally , x - ray variability can be caused by several factors : a change in the accretion rate ; variable absorption ( e.g. abrassart & czerny 2000 ) ; variable reflection ( e.g. through a change of the height of the irradiating source , miniutti & fabian 2004 ; see also gallo 2006 , done & nayakshin 2007 ) ; some combination of reflection and absorption ( e.g. chevalier et al . 2006 ; turner & miller 2009 ) ; hot spots orbiting the central black hole ( turner et al . 2006 ; turner & miller 2009 ) ; local flares ( czerny et al . 2004 ) , etc .",
    "the agn type with the strongest x - ray variability is the class of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s , e.g. osterbrock & pogge , 1985 ) .",
    "in addition , nls1s show the steepest x - ray spectra seen among all agn ( e.g. boller et al .",
    "1996 , brandt et al .",
    "1997 , leighly 1999a , b , grupe et al . 2001 ) .",
    "most of their observed properties , like spectral slopes , feii and [ oiii ] line ratios , civ shifts , etc .",
    ", appear to be driven by the relatively high eddington ratio @xmath2 in these objects ( e.g. sulentic et al .",
    "2000 , boroson 2002 , grupe 2004 , bachev et al .",
    "2004 ) .    what concerns the optical / uv variability , the picture there is even more puzzling .",
    "there are many factors that can contribute to the variations of the optical flux , but most of them can account for the long - term ( months to years ) changes .",
    "there are often reported in many objects , however , short - term ( day to week ) optical / uv variations , simultaneous with or shortly lagging behind the x - ray variations . an interesting idea that can explain such a behaviour is reprocessing of the highly variable x - ray emission into optical / uv bands .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of the relations between the x - ray and the optical / uv emission by studying the variability from x - rays to i - band of the nls1 pg 1211 + 143 .",
    "this nls1 has been the target of almost all major x - ray observatories since einstein ( elvis et al . 1985 ) .",
    "the x - ray continuum displays a strong and variable soft x - ray excess ( pounds & reeves 2007 ) . from xmm - newton rgs data ,",
    "pounds et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested the presence of high - velocity outflows in pg  1211 + 143 , a result that was questioned by kaspi & behar ( 2006 ) .",
    "however , high - velocity outflows seen in x - rays have been repeatedly reported ( e.g. leighly et al . 1997 ) and new xmm - newton data of pg 1211 + 143 ( pounds & page 2006 ) seem to confirm the previous claims made by pounds et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "our primary goal is to find out if and how the x - ray variations are transferred into the longer - wavelength continuum .",
    "time delays between the flaring x - ray emission , presumably coming from a compact , central source and the optical / uv light curves are expected , provided the x - rays are reprocessed in the outer , colder part of an accretion disk .",
    "such a study may have implications on two important problems  the radial temperature distribution of an accretion disk ( and hence  the type of the disk ) and the location of the x - ray source , based on how much the disk `` sees '' it .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the _ swift _  and ground - based optical monitoring observations .",
    "section 3 focuses on presenting the results of this study and in section 4 we discuss these results in the context of the general picture of agn . throughout the paper spectral indexes",
    "are denoted as energy spectral indexes with @xmath3 .",
    "luminosities are calculated assuming a @xmath4cdm cosmology with @xmath5=0.27 , @xmath6=0.73 and a hubble constant of @xmath7=75 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "the _ swift _  gamma - ray burst ( grb ) explorer mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) monitored pg 1211 + 143 between 2007 march 08 and may 20 .",
    "note , that scheduled observations were twice bumped by detections of gamma - ray - bursts , explaining the absence of segments 15 and 20 ( table a1 ) .",
    "after our monitoring campaign in 2007 , pg 1211 + 143 was re - observed by _ swift _  in february 2008 ( segment 24 ) however , this observation was used to slew between two targets .",
    "therefore , this observation is very short ( 188s ) and no x - ray spectra or uvot photometry data were obtained .",
    "this observation only allows to measure a count rate .",
    "a summary of all _ swift _  observations is given in table[obs_log ] .",
    "the _ swift _  x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows et al . 2005 ) was operating in photon counting mode ( pc mode ; hill et al .",
    "2004 ) and the data were reduced by the task _ xrtpipeline _ version 0.10.4 , which is included in the heasoft package 6.1 .",

    ", we created spectral for the low , intermediate , and high states with count rates cr @xmath110.12 counts s@xmath8 , 0.13@xmath11cr@xmath110.2 , and cr @xmath120.2 counts s@xmath8 .",

    "fluxes in the 0.22.0 and 210 kev band for this segment were determined from the count rates in these bands by comparing the fluxes during the high state during segments 018 , 021 , and 022 , assuming no spectral changes .",
