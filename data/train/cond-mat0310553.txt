    "the successful deciphering of the human genome has aggravated an old challenge in protein science : for most of the resolved protein sequences we do not know the corresponding structures and functions .",
    "computer experiments offer one way to evaluate the sequence - structure relationship but are extremely difficult for realistic protein models where interactions among all atoms are taken into account .",
    "the complex form of the intramolecular forces and of the interaction with the solvent , containing both repulsive and attractive terms , leads to a very rough energy landscape with a huge number of local minima .",
    "these minima are separated by energy barriers that are much higher than the typical thermal energy of a protein ( of order @xmath0 ) at room temperature .",
    "hence , simple canonical monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations will get trapped in a local minimum and often not thermalize within a finite amount of available cpu time . while this multiple minima problem does not necessarly inhibits molecular dynamics or monte carlo studies of peptides and proteins @xcite , it restricts calculation of accurate _",
    "thermodynamic _ averages to small peptides @xcite .",
    "a number of novel simulation techniques have been proposed for overcoming this multiple - minima problem ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",
    "important recent examples can be found in ref .  .",
    "another example is parallel tempering , also known as replica exchange method and introduced to protein science in ref .",
    ", that has become increasingly popular over the last few years @xcite .",
    "parallel tempering is only one example of a class of new and sophisticated algorithms commonly summarized as _ generalized - ensemble _ methods @xcite . in this article , we are concerned with another generalized - ensemble technique , multicanonical sampling @xcite , that was first applied to the protein - folding problem in ref .  .",
    "its usefullnes for calculating reliable thermodynamic quantities at low temperatures has been established for small peptides of up to @xmath1 residues @xcite",
    ". however , stable domains in proteins consists usually of 40 - 200 amino acids .",
    "hence , it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach for larger molecules than the peptides investigated so far . for this purpose ,",
    "we have performed generalized - ensemble simulations of the peptide fragment pth(1 - 34 ) corresponding to residues 1 - 34 of human parathyroid hormone @xcite .",
    "the 84-amino acid human parathyroid hormone is involved in the regulation of the calcium level in blood and influences bone formation @xcite .",
    "the nh@xmath2-terminal 34 residues of the hormone , further on refered to as pth(1 - 34 ) , are sufficient for the biological activities of this hormone suggesting medical and pharmaceutical applications of the peptide @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure of the peptide has been resolved at 0.9    and resembles a slightly bend long helix ( pdb code 1et1 ) @xcite .",
    "nmr studies of the peptide in solution under near physiological conditions ( pdb code 1zwa ) @xcite and in 20 % trifluorethanol solution ( pdb code 1hpy ) @xcite rather indicate an ensemble of structures that have in common two helices separated by a disordered region .    in the present article , we try to overcome the problems of previous simulated annealing simulations of pth(1 - 34 ) @xcite , that did not allow a detailed structure evaluation , by using multicanonical sampling @xcite , one of the most prominent generalized - ensemble techniques .",
    "an all - atom representation of the molecule is employed and the intramolecular interactions are described by the ecepp/3 force field @xcite .",
    "the protein - solvent interactions are approximated by the solvent accessible surface term of ooi _",
    "et al_.@xcite quantities such as the average helicity , number of contacts , average energy , and specific heat are calculated .",
    "our results demonstrate the feasibility of generalized - ensemble simulations for large molecules such such as pth(1 - 34 ) .",
    "in addition , they indicate that with the advent of these and other modern search techniques , structure prediction of proteins is limited more by current energy functions ( and especially solvent approximations ) than by the simulation algorithms .",
    "our research into the thermodynamics of pth(1 - 34 ) is based on a detailed , all - atom representation of that peptide .",
    "the interactions between the atoms are described by a standard force field , ecepp/3 @xcite ( as implemented in the program package smmp @xcite ) , and are given by the sum of the electrostatic term @xmath3 , the lennard - jones energy @xmath4 , hydrogen - bond term @xmath5 for all pairs of atoms in the peptide together with the torsion term @xmath6 for all torsion angles : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 ( in  ) is the distance between the atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the torsion angle for the chemical bond @xmath12 and @xmath13 characterizes its symmetry .",
    "the charges and force field parameters @xmath14 were calculated from crystal structures of amino acids using semi - empirical methods .",
    "the dielectricity constant is set to @xmath15 , its common value in ecepp calculations .",
    "since the bond lengths are fixed in ecepp , the backbone torsion angles @xmath16 and the side chain torsion angles @xmath17 are the true degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , in a monte carlo ( mc ) sweep single angles are updated sequentially by the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the protein - water interactions are approximated by a solvent - accessible surface term @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the solvent accessible surface area of the @xmath20 atom in the present configuration , and @xmath21 the solvation parameter for the atom @xmath9 .",
    "we choose the solvation parameter set oons of ref .",
    "@xcite that is often used together with the ecepp force field .",
    "the potential energy of the solvated molecule is then given by @xmath22    in such a detailed protein model , the various competing interactions lead model to an energy landscape with a multitude of local minima separated by high - energy barriers .",
    "canonical monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations will likely get trapped in one of these minima and not thermalize within the available cpu time . only recently , with the introduction of new and sophisticated algorithms such as _ generalized - ensemble _ techniques @xcite was it possible to alleviate this problem in protein simulations @xcite . for simulating pth(1 - 34 )",
    "we have chosen one most commonly used generalized - ensemble technique , multicanonical sampling @xcite .",
    "the multicanonical algorithm @xcite assigns a weight @xmath23 to conformations with energy @xmath24 . here , @xmath25 is the density of states .",
    "a simulation with this weight leads to a uniform distribution of energy : @xmath26 thus , the simulation generates a 1d random walk in the energy space , allowing itself to escape from any local minimum .",
    "since a large range of energies is sampled , re - weighting @xcite allows one to calculate thermodynamic quantities over a wide range of temperatures @xmath27 by @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for configurations , @xmath30 for its total potential energy @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the inverse temperature , @xmath33 .",
    "unlike in constant temperature simulations the weights are not _ a priori _ known in multicanonical simulations .",
    "in fact , knowledge of the exact weights is equivalent to obtaining the density of states @xmath25 , i.e. , solving the system .",
    "however , for a numerical simulations estimators are sufficient as long as these do not deviate not too much from @xmath34 .",
    "this is because the same weights that are used for the simulation appear also in the re - weighting procedure of eq .",
    "[ eqrw ] . in the present study",
    ", we calculate these estimators from a preliminary simulated annealing run of 80,000 mc - sweeps using the method described in ref .  .",
    "all thermodynamic quantities are then estimated from one production run of @xmath35 sweeps , starting from a random initial configuration and after discarding @xmath36 sweeps for thermalization .",
    "we store in every fifth sweep for further analysis various physical quantities and the dihedral angles of the current configuration .",
    "our error bars are estimated by dividing this time series of data into 8 bins of each @xmath37 sweeps .",
    "we start our analysis by calculating thermodynamic averages of the intramolecular energy @xmath38 and the solvation energy @xmath39 . both quantities and the resulting total energy @xmath40",
    "are displayed as function of temperature in fig .",
    "the thermal behavior of the peptide is characterized by a competition between intramolecular and solvation energy .",
    "while @xmath38 decreases with decreasing temperature , @xmath39 increases toward lower temperatures .",
    "the interplay of both terms leads to two temperature regimes that are separated by a steep decrease in the total energy @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding pronounced peak in the specific heat per residue @xmath42 displayed in the inlet , marks the transition temperature at @xmath43 k.    the structural changes associated with this transition can be deduced from fig .  2 where we display the average helicity @xmath44 as a function of temperature . here ,",
    "we have defined @xmath45 as the number of residues whose pair of backbone dihedral angles @xmath46 takes values in the range : @xmath47 .",
    "we see from the plot of both quantities that the high - temperature ( high - energy ) region is characterized by configurations with vanishing helicity ( @xmath48% ) while at low temperatures ( and , correspondingly , low energies ) configurations dominate that are almost completely helical ( @xmath49% of the residues are part of a helix ) .",
    "the pronounced peak at @xmath50 in the susceptibility ( per residue ) @xmath51 shown in the inlet , is further proof for the sharp transition between low - energy helical states and high - energy disordered coil states .",
    "associated with this helix - coil transition is also a decrease in the solvent accessible volume @xmath52 as calculated by the double cubic lattice method @xcite ( data not shown ) . above @xmath50 ,",
    "the average volume is @xmath53 @xmath54 , while below @xmath50 the volume is reduced to @xmath55 @xmath54 .",
    "the modest decrease in @xmath56 together with the large value of the helicity @xmath44 indicate that below @xmath50 a single elongated helix is the dominant structure for pth(1 - 34 ) .",
    "indeed , we find in our simulation as lowest - energy state an elongated helix with 31 residues part of the helix .",
    "this structure , shown in fig .",
    "3b , has not only the lowest _ total _ energy ( @xmath57 kcal / mol ) , but also the lowest _ intramolecular _ energy : @xmath58 kcal / mol .",
    "it is very similar to the crystal structure of pth(1 - 34 ) ( pdb code 1et1 , displayed in fig .",
    "3a ) where also 31 residues are part of an @xmath59-helix and whose energy after regularization with the program fantom @xcite is @xmath60 kcal / mol ( @xmath61 kcal / mol ) .",
    "while our numerically determined structure has a slightly larger solvent - accessible surface area ( @xmath62 @xmath63 ) than the crystal structure ( @xmath64 @xmath63 ) , it has 95% of all native contacts formed , i.e. 95 % of the contacts between residues found in the crystal structure exist also in our lowest - energy configuration . here , we consider two residues in contact if the distance between their c@xmath65-atoms is less than 8  , and the two residues are neither neighbor nor next - nearest neighbor in the peptide chain . given that almost all native contacts are formed in the lowest - energy structure , it is not surprising that the root - mean - square deviation ( rmsd ) between the two structures is only @xmath66   for backbone atoms",
    "( @xmath67   when all heavy atoms are taken into account ) . for comparison , the crystal structure of pth(1 - 34 ) ( 1et1 )",
    "itself was solved at @xmath68   resolution @xcite .",
    "we remark that recent structure determinations of the similar sized villin headpiece subdomain hp-36 , a 36-residue peptide , by energy landscape paving @xcite and parallel tempering @xcite were restricted to an accuracy of @xmath69  .",
    "we believe that the higher accuracy of our pth(1 - 34 ) results does not indicate any advantage of multicanonical sampling over the above methods but is rather due to the simpler geometry of pth(1 - 34 ) .    at @xmath70",
    "k , our lowest energy structure appears with a frequency of @xmath71% , i.e. almost all observed configurations resemble the crystal structure . the predominance of this structure is also reflected in the well - developed funnel in fig .  4 where we display the projection of the free - energy landscape at @xmath70 k on the number of native contacts . the free energy decreases rapidly with increasing number of native contacts . no indications for competing local minima that could act as traps are observed indicating a rather smooth funnel .",
    "on the other hand , at the transition temperature @xmath72 k , the free energy landscape ( displayed in the inlet ) is flat and configurations with small number of native contacts coexist with such that have many native contacts .",
    "however , while the crystal structure is in our simulation the dominant configuration at @xmath70 k , it differs from the set of nmr - structures found at room temperature . in near - physiological solution",
    ", one observes instead two helices separated by a disordered and flexible region .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3c as an example one of the resolved solution configurations ( from 1hpy ) @xcite .",
    "the n - terminal helix ranges from glu@xmath73 to his@xmath74 and the c - terminal helix from ser@xmath75 to gln@xmath76 .",
    "addition of trifluorethanol reduces hydrophobic interactions and increases the length of these helices @xcite .",
    "hence , our simulation of pth(1 - 34 ) does not reproduce the experimental results for that peptide in solution albeit protein - solvent interactions are considered in our energy function by an approximate term .",
    "instead , our simulation favors the crystal structure of the peptide that is observed in membrane and hydrophobic environments .    in order to understand in greater detail the relation between our simulation results and the nmr experiments , we plot in fig .",
    "5a for each residue the free energy difference @xmath77 at @xmath70 k between configurations with residue @xmath9 part of an @xmath59-helix and such where that residue is not part of an @xmath59-helix .",
    "the free - energy differences are largest for residues",
    "asn@xmath78 -lys@xmath79 , and it is for these residues that first helix formation is observed .",
    "a second cluster of residues that have large free - energy differences are observed between ile@xmath80 and asn@xmath81 .",
    "both regions are separated by residues leu@xmath82 - leu@xmath83 that have smaller free energy differences .",
    "the observed free - energy differences are strongly correlated with differences in the ( potential ) energy @xmath84 that together with its two components @xmath85 and @xmath86 are plotted in fig .",
    "note , that the variations in the energy differences result from the @xmath85 part , i.e. from the intramolecular interactions .",
    "the corresponding solvent energies favor in general residues that are not in a helical state but vary little with the residues .",
    "in addition , their magnitude is so small that it is difficult to distinguish in the figure between @xmath84 and @xmath87 .",
    "the position of the two helices in the solvent structure of fig .",
    "3c corresponds to the regions where in our simulation the measured free - energy differences and potential energy differences are large . in the nmr structures ,",
    "the c - terminal helix is more stable than the n - terminal helix .",
    "similarly , we find larger absolute values of @xmath88 kcal / mol ( @xmath89 kcal / mol ) for residues asn@xmath78 to lys@xmath79 ( with the maximal values at arg@xmath90 : @xmath91 kcal / mol and @xmath92 kcal / mol ) compared with @xmath93 kcal / mol ( @xmath94 kcal / mol ) for residues ile@xmath95 to asn@xmath81 . on the other hand , the flexible region connecting the two helices in the nmr structure corresponds to a region of residues that have with @xmath96 kcal / mol and @xmath97 kcal / mol considerably smaller free ( potential ) energy differences .",
    "the free - energy differences are smallest for leu@xmath82 and gly@xmath98 : @xmath99 kcal / mol and and @xmath100 kcal / mol . the later result is not surprising giving the inherent flexibility of glycine ( which , however , is part of the helix in our lowest - energy configuration ) .",
    "the observed variations in the free and potential energy differences suggest that we may find at higher temperatures configurations similar to the nmr structures .",
    "this is because the helix will be de - stabilized with increasing temperature , and more easily for residues leu@xmath82 to leu@xmath83 than in the regions that corresponds to the two terminal helices . in order to test this conjecture",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "6 two quantities as function of temperature .",
    "one is the frequency of configurations that have a continuous helix stretching at least between ile@xmath95 and lys@xmath79 and are therefore similar to the crystal structure of pth(1 - 34 ) .",
    "the second quantity is the frequency of configurations that have helices stretching at least between ile@xmath80 and his@xmath101 and between ser@xmath75 and gln@xmath76 , but are separated in - between by a non - helical flexible region .",
    "hence , the later quantity measures the frequency of configurations that are similar to the nmr structure . a typical example of this group of configurations is displayed in fig .",
    "3d . while this conformation is also a local minimum , its total energy @xmath102 kcal / mol and intramolecular energy @xmath103 kcal / mol are much higher than the corresponding values for the lowest - energy configuration of fig .",
    "3b : @xmath57 kcal / mol and @xmath104 kcal / mol . on the other hand",
    ", its solvation energy @xmath105 kcal / mol is lower than that of fig .",
    "3b ( @xmath106 kcal / mol ) but the differences are smaller than the one in the ecepp/3 term .",
    "both kind of configurations appear at the helix - coil transition temperature @xmath107 k. due to their higher entropy , configurations that resemble the nmr structures are slightly more common for temperatures in the range @xmath108 k @xmath109 k than the ones that are similar to the crystal structure leading to a positive free energy difference @xmath110 that is displayed in the inlet of fig .  6 . at @xmath111",
    "k , 43(4)% of all configurations are similar to the nmr structures and 40(5)% resemble more the crystal structure . below @xmath111",
    "k , the intramolecular energy that favors an extended single helix wins over the higher entropy of states with two separate helices .",
    "the resulting negative free energy difference @xmath110 leads to a decrease in the frequency of nmr - like structures , and their contribution is less than 1% at room temperature .",
    "we conjecture that the above relations hold also in nature .",
    "the elongated helix of the crystal structure is favored by the intramolecular energies and is the ground state in potential energy .",
    "thermal fluctuations lead to the more flexible configurations with two helices that are observed for the soluted peptide . in a ( hydrophobic ) membrane environment or",
    "when binding to a receptor reduces the entropy of the molecule , pth(1 - 34 ) stays in the 1-helix state that also seems to lead to increase its biological activity @xcite .    however , the energy function in our simulation overstabilizes the extended @xmath59-helix of the pth(1 - 34 ) ground state ( the crystal structure ) .",
    "hence , structures that are found in solution with nmr experiments appear in our simulation with significant frequency only at temperatures more than @xmath112 k above room temperature .",
    "similarly , we find with @xmath113 k a helix - coil transition temperature that is much higher than physiological relevant temperature range .",
    "these results clearly point out the limitations of our model . since our data are consistent with what one would expect in a hydrophobic environment one can conjecture that these limitations of the energy function are mainly due to our solvent approximation . the small variation in the magnitude of the solvent energy in figs",
    ".  1 and 5 ( when compared with the ecepp/3 term ) suggests that the oons term underestimates the protein - solvent interaction .",
    "this maybe due to the fact that our implicit solvent model does not account for the hydrogen bonds between the polypeptide and water molecules that in water compete with the characteristic intramolecular hydrogen bonding in an @xmath59-helix . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath59-helices are overstabilized , and our energy function rather models the peptide in a hydrophobic environment than in physiological solution .",
    "another problem is that the solvation energy term of eq .",
    "[ esol ] describes actually a free energy and therefore should change with temperature .",
    "this effect is neglected in the oons approximation .",
    "taking such a temperature dependence into account and use of more sophisticated implicit solvent models would likely improve our results .",
    "however , we can also not exclude the possibility that the deviation from the nmr results is not duee to the solvent term bit that our force field , the ecepp/3 term that describes the intramolecular interactions , biases toward helical conformations .",
    "it follows that other potential energy functions and implicit solvent models have to be chosen for a simulation of pth(1 - 34 ) in solution .",
    "however , the failure of our energy function to model correctly the solvated molecule demonstrates also the advantages of our approach . unlike the earlier simulated annealing simulations of ref .",
    "multicanonical sampling allows one to calculate accurate estimates of the frequency of states and other physical quantities at room temperature . in that way",
    ", we have been able to unveil in the present paper the limitations of our energy function . at the same time , our results allow us to understand the behavior of our peptide in a hydrophobic environment ( since this is what our energy function models ) and to reproduce the crystal structure with high accuracy .",
    "hence , we have shown that multicanonical simulations are not only well - suited for simulations of small peptides but also for numerically more challenging molecules such as the 34-residue peptide pth(1 - 34 ) .",
    "in summary , we have performed all - atom simulations of pth(1 - 34 ) , the biologically active peptide - fragment 1 - 34 of the human parathyroid hormone .",
    "protein - water interactions are approximated by a solvent - accessible surface term using the oons parameter set@xcite .",
    "our results rely on multicanonical sampling and demonstrate that this technique allows one to overcome the multiple minima problem in simulations of this molecule . unlike earlier numerical studies @xcite that relied on simulated annealing we find a lowest - energy configurations that has a rmsd of only 0.8   to the crystal structure . while previous applications of multicanonical sampling were restricted to small peptides with less than 20 residues , our results ( albeit for a molecule with a rather simple structure ) establish that the generalized - ensemble approach is also a useful tool for investigation of much larger polypeptides with @xmath114 residues .",
    "applications to even larger molecules seem to be restricted less by the sampling technique but by the accuracy of the energy function .    *",
