    "as galaxies evolve , they often go through periods when their star formation rates increase substantially .",
    "this is usually ascribed to large - scale perturbations in their structure , such as the formation of bars triggered by interactions with companions , leading to the accumulation of large quantities of gas in their nuclei .",
    "a small number of those so - called ` starburst ' galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been identified in the local universe and have been studied extensively at all wavelengths . at high redshifts ,",
    "obscured starburst galaxies are much more common @xcite , and are believed to give rise to the bulk of the cosmic infrared background radiation .",
    "reviews of their properties can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "understanding the physics of starburst galaxies in the local universe is of great importance , as they are the closest laboratories we have for studying the starburst phenomenon , and because they may represent ` scaled - down ' versions of the starbursts seen at high redshift .",
    "the obscured nature of ( most ) starburst galaxies , regardless of their redshifts , however means that probing their nuclear regions in the optical is challenging .",
    "this task is better done in the infrared , where dust opacity is lower . the advent of major infrared space facilities such as _ iras _ @xcite , _ iso _ @xcite and _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , and in particular the accessibility to high quality spectroscopy , has allowed great progress in this field , including detailed studies of the mid - infrared ( mir ) region of the spectrum in galaxies .",
    "it was discovered that the mid - infrared ( mir ) is rich in emission and absorption features of gas and dust .",

    ". this follows on from our earlier work on the same sample using the low resolution irs modules @xcite .",
    "we have created a high s / n template from these spectra .",
    "our goal is to make this set of high quality spectra available to the community , and to report on their characteristic features .",
    "observations are described in  [ obs ] , and data reduction and analysis is described in  [ danalysis ] .",
    "we present results in  [ results ] and discussion in  [ discussion ] . finally , we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "[ allspectra ]",
    "our sample is presented in table  1 where information on the galaxy optical classifications , distances , magnitudes and other basic information on the observations is given . in nine objects",
    "there is evidence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , even though it does not dominate the bolometric luminosity of the system .",
    "the sample was observed as part of the irs guaranteed time program ( pid 14 ) and consists of 24 well known nearby starburst galaxies , with an average distance of 33  mpc and an average infrared ( ir ) ( 8 - 1000@xmath1 m ) luminosity of 5@xmath12 l@xmath13 .",
    "the observations were made using both the high- and low - resolution modules of the irs .",
    "here we present the high - resolution spectra .",
    "the low - resolution spectra can be found in the companion paper by @xcite .",
    "the two high - resolution modules , short - high ( sh ) and long - high ( lh ) , cover the wavelength region between 10 to 37  @xmath1 m at a resolution of 600 and have slit sizes of 4.7@xmath1111.3  and 11.1@xmath1122.3  respectively .",
    "the data were taken using the staring mode observing template which produces spectra in two _ nod _ positions .",
    "the separation between the _ nod _ positions is 3.8  for sh and 7.4  for lh .",
    "the observations were centered on the nucleus of the galaxies ( see fig .",
    "1 ) at the coordinates given in table  1 .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  1 , the observations of ngc520 and mrk52 are slightly mispointed with the sh slit measuring part of the nucleus . in ngc3310",
    "the mispointing is more severe and affects both modules and therefore any information we give about this galaxy in the paper refers to the position we measured and not the nucleus .",
    "mrk266 is also mispointed but the lh module is large enough to contain the whole galaxy and for the sh module we made use of an observation of another spitzer program in which the source is well centered ( pid@xmath143237 , aorkey@xmath1410510592 ) .",
    "the area covered by the sh slit is equivalent to a spatial scale of about 0.085  kpc to 3.2  kpc , depending on the distance to the objects in our sample .",
    "no dedicated background observations were made .",
    "this means that there will be a small contribution of the zodiacal light to the spectra in figures  2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "this has no consequence for the line measurements .",
    "foreground emission of pahs from our mw is also possible but this is much fainter than the targets themselves . for information of the mid - infrared continuum properties the reader",
    "is referred to the paper on the low resolution spectra @xcite where the background contribution to the continuum has been subtracted from the spectra .",
    "the data were processed using version s15.3 of the _ spitzer _ science center s pipeline which is maintained at cornell and using a script version of _ smart _ @xcite .",
    "the reduction begins from the _ droop _ images which are equivalent to the more commonly used _",
    "bcd _ data but without flatfield and stray - cross - light corrections .",
    "unstable sensitive pixels ( usually referred to as ` rogue ' pixels ) were replaced using the ssc tool _ irsclean _ , which uses campaign - based pixel masks to identify the bad pixels .",
    "at the location of a pixel identified as bad , the empirical profile in the cross dispersion direction is determined using the average profile in the neighboring rows .",
    "this profile is then scaled to the profile of the row containing the bad pixel using the remaining good pixels of that row .",

    "these models predict the contribution of s@xmath32 to be between 7 and 15% of that of s@xmath33 ( which is the dominant contributor to the total sulfur abundance ) . we have thus adopted a 10% contribution of s@xmath32 to the sulfur abundance ( icf@xmath141.1 ) to account for the contribution of this ion in our sample . while we have measured fe@xmath32 and fe@xmath33 from our _ spitzer _ data , fe@xmath26 may be an important contributor ( up to half ) to the total iron .",

    "can be seen from table  5 the icf varies from a few percent to a factor 2 . given the importance of this ion to the total iron budget in those objects with a high icf , the iron abundances we report should be interpreted with care .",
    "the uncertainty for this element in table  5 only takes into account the uncertainty in the fe@xmath32 and fe@xmath33 ionic abundance .    in figure  9 ( top ) , the neon abundance of our starburst sample correlates reasonably well with the sulfur abundance .",
    "this is expected because they are both @xmath23-elements and are being produced in the same type of stars .",
    "this finding was also pointed out by @xcite in their bcd sample and it contradicts earlier findings @xcite who based on _ iso _ data did not find such a correlation between the abundance of these two elements for the starbursts they studied . in our sample",

    "note that the solar abundances of certain elements have been subject to many changes during the last decade @xcite , and thus , we resort to compare to the range of values found in the literature ( 0.69 - 1.2@xmath1110@xmath35 ) .",
    "there is however increasing evidence that the higher solar neon abundance reported agrees better with the findings of studies in galactic hii regions and planetary nebulae .",
    "the sulfur abundance is also lower than solar ( more so than neon , with solar sulfur values ranging from 1.4 - 2.1@xmath1110@xmath28 ) , which is in agreement with many previous studies .",

    "the average excitation temperature and column density are 360@xmath2564  k and 2@xmath1110@xmath38  @xmath39 respectively , and the warm molecular mass ranges from several 10@xmath40 to 8@xmath1110@xmath41m@xmath13 , with an average mass of 1.1@xmath1110@xmath42m@xmath13 .",
    "we stress that these numbers correspond only to the region covered by the sh slit and are based on the fluxes for just the s(1 ) and s(2 ) lines .",
    "rotational lines measured in the irs spectrum . for this plot the fluxes of the h@xmath17 s(2 ) and s(1 ) lines have been scaled based on the sh to lh continuum ( see text for further details).,width=245 ]    recently , @xcite studied the warm molecular hydrogen emission in the nuclear region of a sample of sings galaxies .",
    "the range in areas covered in their observations ( 60  pc to 3.8  kpc ) is very similar to the range covered in our study ( see  2 ) .",
    "their column densities compare well to those found for our starburst galaxies , but their excitation temperatures are on average cooler by @xmath0150  k , and their masses significantly larger ( 10@xmath43 - 10@xmath44 m@xmath13 ) .",
    "this is expected because the sings galaxies have a much lower star formation rate per unit volume compared to our starbursts , and since they are less luminous , a larger fraction of their molecular hydrogen is colder .",
    "` cold ' molecular hydrogen is traced by the s(0 ) line which is not used in our analysis as it falls in the lh slit , but it is used in the sings sample where aperture size differences do not exist .",
    "hence , our computed @xmath45 masses are lower than those found for the sings sample , but this is likely an artifact of the absence of the s(0 ) line in our calculations , rather than a real difference .",
    "we find no relation between the excitation temperature and sources with and without agns .",
    "@xcite analyzed _ spitzer _ data of a sample of ulirgs .",
    "their average excitation temperature ( 336@xmath2515  k ) agrees with that of our starburst sample , but again their warm molecular masses are several hundred s times larger ( 2@xmath1110@xmath46m@xmath13 ) .",
    "it is important to note that most ulirgs fit in the sh aperture while in the starbursts we are only measuring the central region .",
    "still , this difference may point as well to a larger fraction of mass being colder in the starburst sample .",
    "1 .   we have presented high resolution spectra ( r@xmath0600 ) of a sample ( 24 ) of nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "the spectra are dominated by emission from forbidden fine - structure lines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons features .",
    "is detected in six of the eight starbursts with a previously known agn component .",
    "this line is also seen in ngc4194 .",
    "several pah features have been measured in the spectra , some of which are weak and are rarely seen in the spectra of starburst galaxies and hii regions .",
    "an emission feature around 10.7@xmath1 m and an absorption feature at 13.7@xmath1 m are detected for the first time .",
    "their identification is unknown , but the strength of the feature at 10.7@xmath1 m correlates with that other pah features .",
    "the average conditions of the warm gas as traced by the s(1 ) and s(2 ) pure rotational molecular hydrogen lines indicates an average excitation temperature of 355@xmath2560  k and a density of 2@xmath1110@xmath38  @xmath39 .",
    "the warm molecular mass ranges from several 10@xmath40 to 4@xmath1110@xmath41  m@xmath13 .",
    "we provide the combined average spectrum of the 15 ` pure ' starburst galaxies of our sample , which is likely the highest signal to noise mid - infrared spectrum of a @xmath47 l@xmath13 starburst galaxy available from spitzer .",
    "this template is representative of a large range in luminosity and ir color , and provides a good indication of the spectral properties of starburst galaxies at high redshift ."
