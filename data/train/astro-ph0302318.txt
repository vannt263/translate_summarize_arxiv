    "m33 is a low luminosity spiral galaxy in the local group . its large angular extent and well determined distance",
    "make it ideal for a detailed study of the radial distribution of visible and dark matter .",
    "the interplay between the dark and visible matter as well as the nature and the radial distribution of dark matter are still open crucial issues with strong implications for galaxy formation and evolution theories .",
    "m33 has three advantages over its brighter neighbor m31 : _",
    "( i ) _ being of lower luminosity , it is a dark matter dominated spiral in which it is easier to disentangle the dark and luminous mass components ( persic , salucci @xmath3 stel 1996 , corbelli @xmath3 salucci 2000 hereafter cs ) ; _ ( ii ) _ it has no prominent black hole or bulge component in the center ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ) and therefore it can be used to test if the innermost dark matter density profile is consistent with cosmological models which predict a central density cusp ; _ ( iii ) _ being at lower declination , high sensitivity 21-cm observations with the arecibo radio telescope made possible a velocity field map out to large galactocentric radii .",
    "cs have used this velocity field map , together with aperture synthesis data of newton ( 1980 ) and with the tilted ring model results of corbelli @xmath3 schneider ( 1997 ) , to derive the rotation curve of m33 out to 13 disk scalelengths .",
    "this unveiled large scale properties of the mass distribution in m33 , such as the lack of correlation between the dark and visible matter , the dark halo mass and the possible radial slope of the dark matter density .",
    "however some ambiguities are left , especially in the inner regions , where the low spatial resolution of 21-cm observations and the possible role of a stellar nucleus or of the molecular gas component have not allowed to establish unambiguously the steepness of the dark matter density profile .",
    "several authors , e.g. bolatto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , have shown the advantages of using co observations for determining the central densities of dark matter halos .",
    "a full map of the co emission in m33 would not only provide higher spatial resolution data on the velocity field but it would also give a first estimate of the molecular mass distribution in this galaxy .",
    "the very blue color of m33 and the presence of prominent hii regions indicate vigorous star formation activity in the nuclear region and along the spiral arms : here the molecular gas component might represent a substantial fraction of the total disk mass .",
    "co observations of the innermost 500 pc of m33 ( wilson @xmath3 scoville 1989 ) , have confirmed in fact that here the molecular gas has a higher surface density than the atomic gas .",
    "recently heyer , corbelli @xmath3 schneider ( 2003 ) have fully mapped the co emission in m33 using the fcrao 14-m telescope .",
    "a detailed analysis of the molecular gas distribution and emission features will be presented elsewhere . in this paper",
    "we derive only the average radial distribution of the molecular gas mass ( section 2 ) and analyze the kinematics of the co gas ( section 3 ) .",
    "the implications for the dark matter halo models are shown in section 4 .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the velocity field and of the mass surface densities over a large disk area are useful for understanding the processes which trigger the star formation in this galaxy , such as disk instabilities , spiral arms , cooling and heating mechanisms . a possible link between the radial extent of the observed star formation region and the gravitationally unstable region in the disk",
    "is discussed in section 5 .",
    "the nearby spiral galaxy m33 has been fully mapped in the co j=1 - 0 transition with a velocity resolution of 0.81 km s@xmath4 and a spatial resolution of 45 arcsec using the fcrao 14-m telescope ( heyer , corbelli @xmath3 schneider 2003 ) .",
    "a 22.5 arcsec spatial sampling is obtained over an area of about 900 arcmin@xmath5 centered on ra 01@xmath633@xmath750@xmath8.89 and dec 30@xmath93936\".7 . for a distance to m33 of 0.84 mpc ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , which will be used throughout this paper , this means that the total disk area observed is about 44 kpc@xmath5 at a spatial resolution of 165 pc .",
    "here we shall use the data at the original spatial and spectral resolution to derive the kinematical information on the molecular gas .",
    "we analyze in detail each spectrum by assigning a spectral window @xmath10 to any detectable emission feature .",
    "there are a few cases where more than one spectral window is needed but secondary signals are always quite low . if no emission is clearly present in a given spectrum , a spectral window is set based on the diffuse emission detectable when averaging nearby positions .",
    "we compute the integrated brightness temperature @xmath11 in k km s@xmath4 by integrating over @xmath12 the telescope temperature observed at each position in the sky , and dividing this number by the main beam efficiency of the telescope ( which is 0.45 at 115 ghz ) . in order to derive the average radial distribution of the molecular gas",
    "we need a concentric ring model .",
    "45 concentric rings of width 150 pc cover all the m33 surface area observed .",
    "they are tilted as to best fit the neutral hydrogen distribution ( corbelli @xmath3 schneider 1997 ) . inside this area",
    "the position angle of the best fitting ring model changes only slightly , and therefore we consider it constant and equal to 22@xmath13 .",
    "the inclination of the rings increases from 50@xmath13 to 58@xmath13 moving radially outwards , as described in details in section 3 of cs .",
    "we use the concentric ring model for assigning a face on radial distance to each observed position , and for deriving the inclination corrected average flux in each ring . following wilson s results ( wilson 1995 ) we use the standard conversion factor between the co luminosity and the line of sight column density of @xmath14 ( @xmath15  @xmath16 = 4.5@xmath17 m@xmath18 pc@xmath19 ) .",
    "the resulting average surface density of molecular hydrogen , perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy ( i.e. corrected for the disk inclination respect to our line of sight ) , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the estimated total mass of molecular gas is @xmath20 m@xmath18 .",
    "this is a factor 6 higher than measured by wilson @xmath3 scoville ( 1989 ) in the smaller nuclear region .",
    "the molecular hydrogen mass is about 10@xmath21 the neutral hydrogen mass ( @xmath22 m@xmath18 for d=0.84 mpc ) .",
    "the surface density distribution does not peak at the center but shows a peak at a few hundred parsecs from the nucleus , as noted previously by wilson @xmath3 scoville ( 1989 ) .",
    "the most prominent co emission features are located in the innermost 1  kpc region and along the spiral arms .",
    "this can be seen already in the 1.3  @xmath23  7  kpc@xmath5 preliminary emission map ( corbelli 2000 ) oriented along the m33 major axis .",
    "an exponential is fitted to the azimuthally averaged surface density data from 0 to 6  kpc .",
    "we leave out from the fit the last 6 points shown in figure 1 which seem to indicate a plateau at the level of 0.6 m@xmath18  pc@xmath19 . in reality",
    "we do nt have enough sensitivity and coverage in our survey to determine the slope of the @xmath14 distribution so far out .",
    "the best fit to s@xmath24 is shown by the straight line in figure 1 and is given by    @xmath25    therefore the co radial scalelength in m33 is larger than the b and k band scalelengths ( 1.9 and 1.3 kpc respectively , regan @xmath3 vogel 1994 ) . in figure 2",
    "we show the hi as well as the total ( hi + h@xmath26 ) gas distribution in this galaxy .",
    "the total gas surface density can be described by a gaussian profile with half width at half maximum of about 6  kpc .",
    "note that the bump of the spiral arm feature around 2  kpc is visible in the azimuthal averages of the molecular and atomic gas shown in figure 2 .",
    "as wilson @xmath3 scoville ( 1989 ) have already pointed out from a comparison of interferometric and single dish data , small clouds and diffuse emission in m33 contain a non negligible fraction of the total molecular mass .",
    "half of the molecular gas mass that we estimate in m33 resides in fact in regions with integrated flux less than 3@xmath27 1.33 k km s@xmath4 .",
    "@xmath28 is the integrated noise defined in terms of the spectral window @xmath12 as :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the noise in the spectrum at the original resolution of 0.81 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we fit single or double gaussians to all signals with integrated flux @xmath31 with a success rate of 75@xmath21 .",
    "there is no significant shift between the gaussian and the flux weighted mean velocities ( difference is @xmath32 km s@xmath4 and is never above 5 km s@xmath4 ) . in deriving kinematical informations",
    "we shall consider only spectra with @xmath33 , well fitted by gaussian profiles , from positions at angles @xmath34 from the major axis .",
    "these conditions restrict the analysis to a smaller radial range than observed .",
    "luckily the prominent co features come from locations close to the major axis and therefore we do have many points to average for building up a rotation curve .",
    "corrections for the inclination of the disk and for the angle @xmath2 between the spectrum position and the major axis are applied according to the tilted ring model described in the previous section .",
    "radial bin averages of the flux weighted mean velocities are plotted in figure 3 , also for the northern and southern side of the galaxy separately .",
    "error bars in each bin show the dispersion of the velocities about the mean .    in the innermost 1  kpc",
    "the south and north rotation curves coincide reasonably well . beyond this radius",
    "there are some differences both in the dispersions and in the mean values of @xmath35 .",
    "velocities in the southern half of m33 have higher dispersion than in the northern half .",
    "also the southern side shows more clearly wiggles which can be interpreted as signs of density wave perturbations associated with the spiral arms .",
    "the detection of such features in the northern side is more doubtful .",
    "residual velocities , obtained by subtracting the average rotational velocity @xmath36 from the rotational velocity measured in each spectrum , @xmath37 , are shown in figure 4 . in the left hand panel of figure 4 the map of residual velocities",
    "is superimposed to the used tilted ring model , after rotating the galaxy by 22@xmath13 clockwise in the plane of the sky .",
    "cross and square symbols are for positive and negative residuals respectively , and their size is proportional to the amplitude of the residual velocities .",
    "since the approaching side of the galaxy is the northern side ( @xmath38 ) , a positive residual there means that the local velocity is less than the average rotational velocity . for each quadrant of the galaxy ,",
    "the right hand panels of figure 4 show the residual velocities as function of the galactocentric radius .",
    "it hard to judge whether there are signs of non circular motions and spiral density waves in the velocity residuals map .",
    "part of the difficulty is due to the fact the bulk of the co emission comes from localized regions and is not smoothly distributed throughout the disk .",
    "a better attempt can be made in the future with the use of a numerical simulation for any given model assumption .",
    "comparison of the rotation curve in figure 3 with the 21-cm data of newton ( 1980 ) enlightens a discrepancy in the northern inner region , where at @xmath39  kpc the hi velocities are lower by about 10 km s@xmath4 than the co velocities .",
    "this might be due to the lack of atomic gas in the innermost region , which together with the larger 21-cm beam , limits the accuracy of the atomic line measure .",
    "finite angular resolution is not affecting significantly the velocities measured in our co survey . to estimate any possible `` beam smearing '' effect we assume that the true velocity , for a given mass model , is that resulting from rotation curve and perform a numerical simulation to derive the observed velocities ( van den bosch @xmath3 swaters 2001 ) .",
    "the observed velocities at each position on the plane of the sky are the flux weighted means of the rotational velocities along the line of sight , corrected for the assumed ring model and convolved with the shape of the telescope beam .",
    "we then compare the binned data with equally binned values of the velocities resulting from the simulation ( we exclude points which form an angle @xmath40 with the major axis ) .",
    "differences between the observed and the true velocities , for mass models which give a good fit to the data , are always smaller than 0.6 km s@xmath4 except in the innermost 0.5  kpc where the beam smearing effect can lower the observed velocity as much as 2 km s@xmath4 .",
    "rotational velocities , which we use to derive the visible and dark matter distributions in m33 , are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the innermost point at @xmath41  pc is from h@xmath2 measurements of rubin @xmath3 ford ( 1985 ) .",
    "our co data extending over the interval @xmath42  kpc have been averaged into the subsequent 11 bins . for @xmath43",
    "kpc data are taken from 21-cm observations of newton ( 1980 ) at the cambridge half - mile telescope while for larger radii we use arecibo 21-cm data ( cs and references therein ) . the plotted error bars in each bin are twice the dispersion of the velocities about the mean .",
    "we consider the dynamical contribution of two visible mass components : stars , distributed in a disk and in the nucleus , and gas , in molecular and in neutral atomic form .",
    "for the stellar disk we consider that the mass follows the light distribution in the k - band , well fitted by an exponential with scalelength @xmath44  kpc ( regan @xmath3 vogel 1994 ) . after subtracting the exponential disk from the surface brightness ,",
    "a central emission excess remains at @xmath39  kpc ( bothun 1992 , regan @xmath3 vogel 1994 ) which has been attributed to spiral arms , to an extended semistellar nucleus or to a diffuse halo or bulge .",
    "we shall refer to this excess as the `` nucleus '' of m33 despite the fact that in the literature the word `` nucleus '' is often used for the light excess observed only at @xmath45  pc ( kormendy @xmath3 mcclure 1993 ) .",
    "nuclear rotational velocities have been observed in h@xmath2 along the major axis between 20 and 200  pc from the center ( rubin @xmath3 ford 1985 ) , and seem roughly constant at about @xmath46  km s@xmath4 .",
    "this flatness of the rotation curve is quite puzzling and needs further investigation once uncertainties on the nuclear rotational velocities will be established together with a knowledge of the velocity field along different directions . in this paper",
    "we model the rotation curve at @xmath47  pc only , considering two different possibilities for the nuclear component @xmath48 at these radii :    @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "this rotational velocity approximates the dynamical contribution of a spheroidal mass distribution whose surface density can be fitted by a de vaucouleurs @xmath51 law ( hernquist 1990 ) .",
    "this scaling law has been used by regan @xmath3 vogel ( 1994 ) to fit the j - band nuclear surface brightness .",
    "the compatibility of the fit with photometric data in other bands ( e.g. bothun 1992 ) is somewhat uncertain , as is the value of the scalelength @xmath52 .",
    "suggested values of @xmath52 lie in the range @xmath53  kpc , which we will consider in this paper .",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 , as if core collapse has happened or is happening in the compact stellar nucleus ( cohn 1980 , kormendy @xmath3 mcclure 1993 ) .",
    "the corresponding power - law mass density distribution develops up to a limiting outer radius @xmath56 , which should also be given . for @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "we consider as possible @xmath56 values the radius of each data point of the rotation curve inside the optical region i.e. @xmath59  kpc .",
    "we consider also the case @xmath60  pc , which is appropriate if most of the nuclear mass resides at very small radii and the nucleus can be treated as a point source throughout the extent of the present rotation curve .    hereafter , we will refer to these models as nuclear model ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively .",
    "it has been established by cs that the visible baryons in m33 are only a small fraction of the total galaxy mass , and that a dark matter halo is in place .",
    "we will use the m33 rotation curve presented here to test in details the consistency of the required halo density profile with theoretical models which predict a well defined dark matter distribution around galaxies .",
    "namely , in addition to the widely used non - singular isothermal dark halo model we shall consider a spherical halo with a dark matter density profile as originally derived by navarro frenk and white ( 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ) for galaxies forming in a cold dark matter scenario ( hereafter cdm ) .",
    "we consider also the burkert and the moore dark matter density profile ( burkert 1995 , moore et al .",
    "all models have two free parameters to be determined from the rotation curve fit . the density distribution for a non - singular isothermal dark halo can be written as :    @xmath61    the density profile proposed by burkert ( 1995 ) has also a flat density core :    @xmath62    and a strong correlation between the two free parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 has been found by fitting the rotation curve of low mass disk galaxies .",
    "the nfw density profile is :    @xmath65    numerical simulations of galaxy formation in cdm models find a correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 which depends on the cosmological model ( avila - reese et al .",
    "2001 , eke navarro and steinmetz 2001 ) .",
    "often this correlation is expressed using the concentration parameter @xmath68 and @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 is the radius of a sphere containing a mean density @xmath72 times the critical density , @xmath70 and @xmath69 are the characteristic velocity and mass inside @xmath71 .",
    "we use a hubble constant @xmath73  km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and show results for @xmath74 , as in cdm halo models of eke navarro and steinmetz ( 2001 ) , unless otherwise specified .",
    "a similar profile but with a different central slope has been suggested instead by numerical simulations of moore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for galaxies forming in cdm scenarios :    @xmath75    for each dark halo model and each nuclear model we shall determine five free parameters applying the least - square method to the observed rotation curve .",
    "these free parameters are : the dark halo core radius @xmath76 , the dark matter density @xmath77 computed at @xmath78  kpc , the ratio between the stellar disk mass @xmath79 and the blue luminosity of the galaxy @xmath80 ( @xmath81  l@xmath18 ) , the nuclear mass @xmath82 , and the nuclear scale length @xmath52 or the cut - off radius @xmath56 .",
    "the 1-@xmath83 , 2-@xmath83 and 3-@xmath83 ranges are determined using the reduced @xmath84 and assuming gaussian statistics . they are computed by determining in the free parameters space the projection ranges , along each axis , of the hypersurfaces corresponding to the 68.3@xmath21 , 95.4@xmath21 and 99.7@xmath21 confidence levels .    both the non - singular isothermal dark halo model and the burkert dark matter density profile give good fits to the rotation curve since the minimum reduced @xmath84 is 0.7 for the nuclear model ( 1 ) and 1.2 for the nuclear model ( 2 ) .",
    "the best fitting values of the free parameters are : @xmath85  kpc , @xmath86  m@xmath18 , @xmath87m@xmath18/l@xmath18 , @xmath88  kpc or @xmath89  kpc , @xmath90  g @xmath91 for the nuclear model ( 1 ) , and @xmath92  kpc , @xmath93  m@xmath18 , @xmath94  m@xmath18/l@xmath18 , @xmath95  kpc or @xmath96  kpc , @xmath90  g @xmath91 for the nuclear model ( 2 ) .",
    "the 3-@xmath83 ranges for the free parameters of both the isothermal and the burkert model are :    @xmath97    @xmath98    the resulting 3-@xmath83 range for the nuclear scale length @xmath52 in the nuclear model ( 1 ) covers the whole range we have considered i.e. @xmath53  kpc . for the nuclear model ( 2 ) instead we find a lower limit to @xmath56 .",
    "this means that the nucleus can not be considered a point source for any possible dark halo models we are examining .",
    "this ` dynamical ' conclusion agrees with photometric data ( bothun 1992 , minniti , olszewski @xmath3 rieke 1993 , regan @xmath3 vogel 1994 ) showing an excess of light inward of 0.5  kpc after subtracting the exponential disk .",
    "unfortunately estimates of the nuclear luminosity @xmath99 are still quite uncertain : in the b - band @xmath100  l@xmath101 ( bothun 1992 , regan @xmath3 vogel 1994 ) , and we can not limit the nuclear stellar mass range further based on possible unrealistic values of the mass to light ratio ( bell @xmath3 de jong 2001 ) .",
    "an extended nucleus is not required instead if the density of the dark matter scales as @xmath102 throughout the halo ; these type of solutions has been investigated by cs and provides also good fits to the rotation data presented in this paper .",
    "both the burkert and the isothermal model require a very extended core region of nearly constant dark matter density .",
    "figure 5@xmath103 shows the best fit using the burkert profile with the nuclear model ( 1 ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath83 and 3-@xmath83 probability contours for @xmath85  kpc in the @xmath104 plane are displayed in figure 6@xmath103 .",
    "the correlation found by burkert between @xmath63 and @xmath64 implies a relation between @xmath77 and @xmath64 shown with crosses in figure 6@xmath103 .",
    "we can see that the m33 acceptable parameters lie close to , but outside , the burkert correlation line .",
    "so either the found scaling relation between @xmath77 and @xmath64 should be slightly modified to include m33 , or it changes for values of @xmath64 larger than those considered by burkert . a burkert model which fits m33",
    "is indistinguishable from an isothermal model since both require a large constant density core region and , even at the outermost fitted radius , the dark matter density does not decline yet as an @xmath105 or @xmath106 power law .",
    "the dark matter density profile suggested by moore fails to fit the observed rotation curve in m33 .    for the nfw dark matter density profile for @xmath74 or 200",

    "the central steepness of the nfw dark matter density profile lowers the nuclear stellar mass required to fit the rotational data .",

    "in the previous section we have determined the dark matter and stellar contribution to the m33 rotation curve . despite the fact that the radial scaling law of the dark matter density required for fitting the rotation curve is not unique , the total baryonic and dark mass up to the last measurable point ( r=17 kpc )",
    "are determined with small uncertainties .",
    "the total stellar mass in the m33 disk is estimated to be 3 - 6@xmath23 10@xmath139 m@xmath18 .",
    "the mass of the dark halo at the outermost observable radius is about a factor 10 higher than the stellar disk mass .",
    "the neutral hydrogen plus the molecular gas mass is 2.4@xmath140 m@xmath18 .",
    "we do nt have a firm estimate of the nuclear stellar mass @xmath82 , but all three possible dark matter models discussed in this paper require an extended distribution .",
    "its mass lies in the range @xmath141  m@xmath18 if the dark halo has a large size core of constant density , while @xmath142  m@xmath18 if the dark halo has a central cusp as in nfw model .",
    "we can estimate the total surface density of visible baryons in m33 neglecting at the moment the small contribution from the ionized gas .",
    "figure 7 shows the total baryonic surface density computed by adding the helium to the molecular and the neutral atomic gas ( a 1.33 factor correction ) , and adding to this the nuclear and stellar disk surface density .",
    "we use the mass model displayed in figure 5@xmath119 , for which we show also the dark matter surface density within 0.5  kpc from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "we extrapolate the fits of the stellar and molecular gas surface density out to 16  kpc but it is likely they experience a truncation at smaller radii . for the hi surface density only we know that it declines sharply beyond 15 - 16 kpc due to ionization effects by an extragalactic background ( corbelli @xmath3 salpeter 1993 ) .",
    "the gas distribution is likely to extend further out but the dominant phase becomes ionized atomic hydrogen . assuming a gaseous vertical extent of 0.5  kpc above and below the galactic plane , we can say that the surface density of visible baryons falls below the dark matter surface density contained in the m33 disk for @xmath143  kpc .",
    "a similar conclusion applies also for the burkert best fit model .    using our accurate measurement of the rotational velocity gradient and of the surface density of the baryonic and non baryonic components",
    ", we can check if the onset of massive star formation in m33 is strongly related to a global instability of the disk .",
    "one of the most popular tools used to assess the gravitational stability of gaseous disks is the toomre stability criterion :    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is the gas surface mass density , @xmath146 is the disk thickness factor , @xmath147 is the epicyclic frequency ( toomre 1964 ) , g is the gravitational constant , @xmath148 is the gas velocity dispersion .",
    "we shall use both @xmath149 as for a thin disk and @xmath150 to mimic instead a disk with a finite thickness ( romeo 1992 ) .",
    "the criterion described by equation ( 7 ) is not at all related to the star formation efficiency but it correctly predicts the occurrence of a star formation threshold radius which , in many spiral galaxies , has been determined from the drop of the h@xmath2 surface brightness ( e.g. martin @xmath3 kennicutt 2001 ) . in m33 kennicutt ( 1989 )",
    "observed such a drop at @xmath151  kpc .",
    "however , since the early work of kennicutt it is well known that the simple toomre stability criterion fails to account for the active star forming region in the disk of low mass spirals such as m33 ( elmegreen 1993 , van zee et al .",
    "1997 , wong @xmath3 blitz 2002 ) .",
    "an alternative stability criterion includes the shear rate of the disk and it may be more appropriate for irregular galaxies ( elmegreen 1993 , hunter elmegreen @xmath3 baker 1998 ) .",
    "it is based on the consideration that making new stars is possible only when there is enough time for the instability to grow , before shear stretches the perturbation apart .",
    "this corresponds to the following condition :    @xmath152    where the oort constant @xmath153 is the local shear rate . in figure 8",
    "we display @xmath154 and @xmath155 , using @xmath156  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this value is at the lowest end of the cold gas velocity dispersion range estimated in m33 ( 6 - 9 km  s@xmath4 , warner at al .",
    "1973 , thilker 2000 ) .",
    "the thin and thick continuous lines in figure 8 show the mass surface densities for @xmath149 and for @xmath150 respectively .",
    "the arrow indicates @xmath157 .",
    "we can see in figure 8@xmath103 that at @xmath158 the azimuthally averaged surface gas density for a thin disk falls below the threshold for a gravitational instability to develop according to the shear rate criterion .",
    "we shall investigate now if considering additional sources of gravity in the disk , a modified version of the classical toomre criterion can still give correct predictions for the star formation threshold radius .",
    "since the masses of stars and gas in the m33 disk are comparable , we are encouraged to use a stability parameter for a two components fluid .",
    "following wang @xmath3 silk ( 1994 ) we define @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the surface density and velocity dispersion of the stars in the disk . using the epicyclic frequency or the shear rate of the disk ,",
    "the stability condition reads :    @xmath162    figure 8@xmath119 shows @xmath163 , using @xmath136  m@xmath18/l@xmath18 for deriving @xmath164 ( as for the mass model shown in fig .",
    "5@xmath119 ) , and @xmath165 . for @xmath156",
    "km  s@xmath4 this last ratio implies @xmath166  km  s@xmath4 , a value observed in the central regions of m33 ( kormendy and mcclure 1993 , gebhardt et al .",
    "we can see that with a value of @xmath167 slightly higher than 0.7 , the toomre criterion for a thin disk predicts correctly a gravitationally unstable disk for @xmath168 . if finite thickness effects are taken into account or if @xmath148 is higher than 6  km  s@xmath4 at @xmath158 we need the shear rate criterion .",
    "following hunter , elmegreen @xmath3 baker ( 1998 ) we consider also the possible influence of dark matter gravity .",
    "if @xmath169 is the dark matter surface density within the vertical extent of the gas , we can rewrite equation ( 9 ) as    @xmath170    in figure 8@xmath171 we show @xmath172 assuming a gaseous extent of 0.5  kpc above and below the galactic plane and a nfw dark matter profile as used for the rotation curve fit displayed in figure 5@xmath119 . in this case",
    "finite thickness effects , or equivalently a velocity dispersion as high as 9  km  s@xmath4 , make the disk gravitationally unstable , according to the toomre criterion , exactly for @xmath168 .",
    "this solution is not unique .",
    "if the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium for example , the gas vertical extension and the velocity dispersion are not independent variables .",
    "an approximation to the scale height of the gas for a galactic disk of stars and gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in a dark matter halo is given by    @xmath173    since @xmath169 is the dark matter surface density between @xmath174 and @xmath175 the above formula should be solved numerically for determining @xmath176 and @xmath169 . in figure 8@xmath177",
    "we plot @xmath178 , for @xmath169 between @xmath179 for the same dark matter density used in figure 8@xmath171 .",
    "we find that @xmath176 varies between 20  pc and 1  kpc through the radial extent of the disk analyzed in this paper .",
    "this model reduces the radii of the unstable star forming regions respect to the constant scale height model displayed in figure 8@xmath171 , making both @xmath155 and @xmath154 suitable indicators of the growth of instabilities in the disk .",
    "which one it is better to use for defining a threshold radius in m33 is therefore still unclear since this depends on the radial variations of the involved parameters such as sound speed , thickness etc . which are not well determined yet .",
    "it is important to notice however that since the densities of visible baryons and dark matter are well constrained at intermediate radii , the intersections between @xmath155 or @xmath154 and @xmath180 do not depend on which mass model we use , as soon as it is compatible with the rotational velocity data .",
    "the burkert best fitting mass model , for example , gives the same solutions displayed in figure 8 for a nfw dark matter halo .",
    "a full map of the nearby galaxy m33 in the co j=1 - 0 transition has given additional data for improving the accuracy of the rotation curve of this galaxy and the knowledge of the visible baryons distribution .",
    "the molecular gas peaks in the central regions with a surface density of about 7  m@xmath18 pc@xmath19 and declines exponentially with a radial scalelength of about 2.5  kpc down to about 0.6  m@xmath18 pc@xmath19 at @xmath181  kpc .",
    "our sensitivity was not sufficient to outline the molecular gas radial distribution further out and in particular to detect any possible sudden drop of the azimuthally averaged molecular gas surface density .",
    "the molecular gas is not smoothly distributed in the inner disk since there are remarkable mass concentrations along the spiral arms .",
    "some wiggles of about 10 km s@xmath4 are visible in the rotation curves of the two separate halves of the galaxy , which are reminiscent of density wave perturbations .",
    "details of atomic and ionized gas distribution in m33 can be found in hoopes @xmath3 walterbos ( 2000 ) and in thilker , braun @xmath3 walterbos ( 2001 ) .",
    "the rotation curve derived using h@xmath2 data for the innermost point , the co data and the hi 21-cm line data , has been used to constrain the visible baryonic mass and dark matter halo models .",
    "the total gas mass ( hi+h@xmath26+he ) is @xmath182  m@xmath18 .",
    "this is of the same order of the stellar disk mass , estimated to be between 3@xmath140 and 6@xmath140 m@xmath18 .",
    "the total visible baryonic mass of m33 can therefore be as high as @xmath183  m@xmath18 .",
    "the dark halo mass out to the last measured point ( @xmath184  kpc from the center ) is @xmath185  m@xmath18 .    both the non - singular isothermal halo and the burkert halo model , give good fits to the m33 rotation curve when the flat density core is extended .",
    "the pure @xmath105 or @xmath106 outer scaling law applies only beyond the outermost observed radius .",
    "dark matter density profiles with an inner @xmath1 cusp ( moore et al .",
    "1998 ) are too steep to be consistent with the rotation of the central regions of m33 and are ruled out .",
    "halo models with milder central cusps , such as the nfw radial profile , fit well all the observed rotational velocities .",
    "the mass of the virialized nfw dark halo for this galaxy is @xmath186  m@xmath18 and the halo size comparable to the distance between m33 and its bright companion m31 ( @xmath187  kpc ) .",
    "the baryon fraction in m33 is then @xmath188 .",
    "the required concentrations @xmath130 are below the scaling laws found by numerical simulations of structures formation in a standard cold dark matter scenario ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125=0.9 ) and favor cosmological models which predicts less concentrated dark halos ( eke , navarro @xmath3 steinmetz 2001 , zentner @xmath3 bullock 2002 , van den bosch , mo @xmath3 yang 2003 ) .",
    "we have shown however that if an associated scatter in the numerical simulation results is considered ( wechsler et al .",
    "2002 ) , the m33 dark halo is still compatible with galaxy formation models in a standard @xmath127cdm cosmology .",
    "the finding that dark matter halos are consistent with constant density core models or with central cusps less steep than @xmath1 , is known as the cusp - core degeneracy ( van den bosch @xmath3 swaters 2001 ) .",
    "it is remarkable that this degeneracy holds also in m33 which is a galaxy with small uncertainties about its distance , its gaseous and stellar content , and with circular velocities sampled over a wide range of radii : from galactocentric distances of a few parsecs out to 13 disk scalelengths . for this galaxy",
    "it seems that the degeneracy holds mostly because of a nuclear stellar component , which regulates the dynamics of the innermost 0.5  kpc region .",
    "this extended ` stellar nucleus ' , with mass between @xmath189 and @xmath190  m@xmath18 , is not only dynamically required by the rotational data but it is also evident from photometric data ( bothun 1992 , minniti , olszewski @xmath3 rieke 1993 , regan @xmath3 vogel 1994 ) .",
    "we have considered a core collapse model and a de vaucouleurs @xmath51 law for the nuclear stellar density but additional data on the kinematics and light distribution of the central few hundreds parsec region are needed to constrain better the mass distribution there .",
    "having a very accurate rotation curve and a good estimate of the gas , stellar and dark matter surface density in the m33 disk , we have addressed the question on the possible coincidence of the active star formation region in this galaxy with a gravitationally unstable region .",
    "azimuthal averages of the observed gas surface densities are above the critical densities in the star forming region of m33 only if one considers the minimum acceptable value of the gas velocity dispersion and a stability criterion based on the shear rate of the disk .",
    "however , the simple toomre condition predicts a star formation threshold radius in agreement with the observed drop in the h@xmath2 surface brightness if the additional compression due to the stellar disk or to the dark matter surface density is considered .",
    "i acknowledge steve schneider and mark heyer for having given me the opportunity to use the co data prior to publication .",
    "i am also very thankful to the anonymous referee who made several excellent suggestions for improving the quality of the work presented in the original manuscript ."
