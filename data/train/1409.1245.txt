    "over the last decades , due to experimental improvements , there is an increasing interest in physical systems where finite size effects play an important role .",
    "this is the case of experiments considering effects of extra spatial dimensions or the dependence of the critical temperature on the size of superconductors in films , wires and grains  @xcite .",
    "compactification is a basic reason for the existence of the casimir effect , which , for the electromagnetic field , has been measured with a high accuracy only recently  @xcite .",
    "another outstanding example of size effects is in the transition of the confined to the deconfined state of matter , in particle physics , giving rise to the phase - transition from hadrons to a plasma of quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "these results have motivated the development of formalisms to treat size effects  , such as the quantum field theory on a torus , with well established perturbative methods  @xcite .",
    "taking into consideration practical applications , in this review , we present developments for the quantum field theory defined on spaces with topologies @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dimension of the whole space manifold and @xmath4 is the number of compactified dimensions on the hyper - torus @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 ; these can be time ( real or imaginary ) and spatial dimensions , describing systems in thermal equilibrium subjected to spatial constraints .",
    "currently , topologies of this type may be associated with extra dimensions ; however this is quite an old idea .",
    "historically , one of the first works exploring the notion that our world might have more than four dimensions was carried out by nordstrm  @xcite , as a generalization of the einstein theory of gravitation to a 5-dimensional space - time .",
    "later on , kaluza  @xcite and klein  @xcite proposed that the fourth spatial dimension would have a finite size , being curved in the form of a circle .",
    "the result is that the equations are separated into sets , one of which describes the einstein equations and the other is equivalent to maxwell equations .",
    "geometrically , the extra fifth dimension can be viewed as the circle group u(1 ) , which corresponds to the formulation of the electromagnetic theory as a gauge theory with gauge group u(1 ) .",
    "there are many theoretical studies in these directions , in particular in string theory which has been reviewed in other places  .",
    "the existence of such extra dimensions have not been observed in experiments , although there are several studies considering extra - dimension effects , such as the seminal paper by randal and sundrum  @xcite .",
    "this is a way to investigate , for instance , the electroweak transition and baryogenesis , by taking a 5-dimensional space - time , using finite - temperature field theory with a compactified extra dimension  .",
    "considering that these extra compactified dimensions are beyond our four - dimensional world , it is reasonable to assume that their presence may give rise to effects at different scales , not just those in the cosmological or high energy physics realm , but also in low energy phenomena  @xcite . with this perspective , effects on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , associated with extra - dimensional excitations of the photon and of w and z bosons ,",
    "have been studied  @xcite . since the @xmath7 experiment at the brookhaven national laboratory ( usa ) in 2004 , and subsequent ones , the expected value for @xmath8 obtained by standard theoretical calculations ( that predict @xmath9 ) could not be confirmed .",
    "the reason is that both theoretical predictions and experimental results have a large uncertainty .",
    "although a conclusive response is not available , a value of @xmath10 has not been excluded  @xcite . in the framework of quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "a recent experiment for the electron magnetic moment gives a more precise value for @xmath8 : the claimed uncertainty is nearly 6 times lower than in the past .",
    "however , there is still a deviation from the value @xmath9  @xcite . in atomic physics ,",
    "very accurate measurements of the asymptotic quantum effects on rydberg excitations have also been carried out  @xcite . in this case , another interesting consequence of the possible existence of extra dimensions is that the electric charge may not be exactly conserved ; a subject that has been under discussion for a long time  @xcite . in four - dimensional theories ,",
    "a very small deviation from electric charge conservation would lead to incompatibilities with low - energy tests of quantum electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "these inconsistencies can be cured by the introduction of hypothetical millicharged particles  @xcite . however",
    ", this artifact would not be necessary if our world were considered as a submanifold of a higher - dimensional space  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , in short , many of these studies , with compactified extra - dimensions , lie in the framework of topologies @xmath11  .",
    "this concept of compactification is not restricted to the discussion of extra - dimensions .",
    "an important development , which has its roots in the late fifties , is the first systematic approach to quantum field theory at finite temperature : the imaginary - time ( matsubara ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental aspect of this method is that it relies on the periodicity ( antiperiodicity ) of the correlation functions of bosons ( fermions )  @xcite .",
    "this periodicity in imaginary - time approach is equivalent to formulating the theory in a compactified torus @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a circumference of length proportional to the inverse of the temperature  @xcite .",
    "the same mathematical apparatus is applied to a field theory compactified in both space and time  .",
    "it should be mentioned the pioneering contribution by birrell and ford  @xcite , who developed a generalization of the matsubara mechanism to include compactification of space coordinates .",
    "these ideas led to numerous other developments that include spontaneous symmetry breaking for field theories on torus , establishing solid aspects on previous attempts to bring together particle physics and cosmology , such as in the concept of topological mass generation  .    the topological framework to study finite temperature effects and spatial constraints is developed by considering a @xmath14-dimensional manifold with a topology of the type @xmath15 , with @xmath16 corresponding to the compactification of time and @xmath17 referring to the compactification of @xmath18 spatial dimensions .",
    "a characteristic of this topological structure is that it leads to modifications of boundary conditions imposed on fields and correlation functions , but it does not modify the local field equations ; @xmath19 , the topology plays a role on global properties of the system , but not on local ones , which are associated with the invariants of the lie space - time symmetries  @xcite .",
    "these developments , that also include algebraic and perturbative analysis , make a toroidal quantum field theory attractive for a broad range of applications .",
    "for instance , an analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking for scalar field theories at finite temperature with a compactified spatial dimension  @xcite has been carried out for superconductors  . in this case , the ginzburg - landau model for phase transitions is generalized .",
    "the model is defined on a @xmath20-dimensional euclidean space with one , two or three compactified spatial dimensions ; the size of which is respectively the thickness of a film , the cross section of a wire or the volume of a grain .",
    "the critical temperature is found as a function of these quantities and minimal sizes , sustaining the transition , are determined .",
    "such achievements are in reasonable agreement with experimental results  @xcite .    a similar analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking has been considered for four - fermion interacting fields , a model for describing systems in condensed matter physics , such as superconductivity  @xcite and aspects of graphene defined from a dirac theory in @xmath21 dimensions  @xcite . in this case , the quantized hall conductivities , which are identified as the topological ( toroidal ) tknn ( thouless , kohmoto , nightingale , den nijs )  @xcite integers , are also associated with graphene lattice  @xcite .",
    "these are important applications of the toroidal topology that have been explored and revised extensively  @xcite .",
    "four - fermion interaction is also employed in phenomenological approaches for particle physics .",
    "simple models describing such interaction are the nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite and the gross - neveu model  @xcite .",
    "both have been formulated on a torus , in order to study , as effective theories for quantum chromodynamics , the phase - transition in the confining / deconfining region  . beyond a phase diagram structure",
    ", this formalism provides a critical temperature for the confinement / deconfinement transition in accordance with lattice calculations .",
    "another application of the toroidal quantum field theory is the casimir effect .",
    "as first analyzed by casimir  @xcite , the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field confined between two conducting plates with separation @xmath22 give rise to an attractive force between the plates .",
    "the effect has been studied in different geometries , topologies , fields and physical boundary conditions  .",
    "the investigations are of interest in diverse areas , such as nano - devices in condensed matter physics , the confinement / deconfinement transition in particle physics and cosmological models  .",
    "many aspects of the casimir effect have been analyzed by studying fluctuations of the vacuum of a field theory compactified on a torus .",
    "this is , in particular , due to the association of the toroidal topology with the dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions  .",
    "it is important to emphasize the nature of calculations in the local formulation , initiated by brown and maclay  @xcite , to derive the energy - momentum tensor of quantum fields : a procedure that leads naturally to standard renormalization scheme associated with the casimir effect .",
    "our goal here is to present the theory of the quantum field theory on a torus as a representation theory , focussing on the aforementioned applications .",
    "the presentation is organized in the following way . in section 2 ,",
    "we review some aspects of the quantum field theory at finite temperature , emphasizing its topological structure , the torus @xmath1 , in imaginary- and real - time formalism .",
    "these results are generalized , in section 3 , for theories on torus @xmath23 .",
    "the algebraic structure of such a theory is analyzed in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", the casimir effect is reviewed for the electromagnetic and dirac fields . in section 6 , the notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking is developed for a quantum theory on a torus .",
    "these results are used , in section 7 , to analyze superconductivity in films , wires and grains . in section 8 ,",
    "the gross - neveu and the nambu - jona - lasinio model are studied on toroidal topologies . in section 9 , a quantum electrodynamics with an extra - compactified dimension",
    "is developed .",
    "the final conclusions and additional comments are presented in section 10 .",
    "a systematic approach to many - body physics at finite - temperature was initiated by matsubara  @xcite .",
    "his method is equivalent to a time - axis wick rotation of a quantum mechanical system , giving rise to what is known as _ imaginary time _ formalism .",
    "further developments included the search for mathematical structures , such as geometrical and topological features , and the generalization of the theory for relativistic particles physics , following along the lines of zero temperature quantum field theory  .",
    "a first generalization of the matsubara work was carried out by ezawa , tomozawa and umezawa  @xcite , who extended the imaginary - time formalism to quantum field theories .",
    "they discovered , in particular , the periodicity ( anti - periodicity ) condition for correlation functions of boson ( fermion ) fields ; a concept that later became known as the kms ( kubo , martin and schwinger ) condition  @xcite .",
    "kubo introduced this condition in his paper on linear - response theory  @xcite in quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "later , martin and schwinger  @xcite , developing a real - time formalism for thermal systems in a non - equilibrium state  @xcite , used the kms condition in quantum electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "these accomplishments were explored further by kadanoff and baym  @xcite .",
    "the kms condition , an acronym coined by haag , hugenholtz and winnink  @xcite , was early identified as a structural mathematical aspect of the quantum field theory at finite temperature , which was in turn associated with the c*-algebra  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary - time quantum field theory has been applied to different areas .",
    "for instance , numerous studies using quantum chromodynamics  @xcite have been carried out in attempts to understand the quark - gluon plasma and the hadronization phase - transition  @xcite . an important step to this understanding",
    "was carried out by dolan and jackiw  @xcite , who studied the effective potential of the @xmath24 theory at finite temperature , developing the concept of spontaneous symmetry - breaking / restoration .",
    "the imaginary - time formalism is restricted to equilibrium systems",
    ". however , there are many examples in high energy and condensed matter physics where time dependance is crucial .",
    "this has motivated , over the decades , the search for a real - time formalism at finite temperature  .",
    "one of these real - time methods is the closed - time path formulation initially due to schwinger  @xcite .",
    "the approach is constructed by following a path in the complex - time plane and important contributions , which deserve to be mentioned , were carried out by martin and schwinger  @xcite , mahanthappa  @xcite , bakshi and mahanthappa@xcite , keldysh  @xcite , and kadanoff and baym  @xcite . from this procedure",
    "an effective doubling of the degrees of freedom emerges , such that green functions are represented by @xmath25 matrices .",
    "actually , such a doubling has been recognized as an intrinsic characteristic of real - time finite - temperature field theories , providing a correct definition for perturbative analysis  @xcite .",
    "this method is called the schwinger - keldysh formalism .",
    "the real - time formalism can be derived from a linear - algebra representation theory .",
    "such a theory was first presented by takahashi and umezawa  @xcite , and was called _ thermofield dynamics _ ( tfd ) . as a consequence of the real - time requirement ,",
    "a doubling is defined in the original hilbert space of the system , through the algebraic structure called tilde conjugation rules and thermo - algebras .",
    "the temperature is then introduced by a bogoliubov transformation ; that is , a rotation in the doubled space .",
    "furthermore , the propagators are @xmath25 matrices . from this fact , an algebraic association with the schwinger - keldysh method",
    "is established  @xcite .",
    "a thermal theory can be also studied by formulating tfd within the framework of @xmath26 * -algebras and thermo - lie groups , a modular representation of lie - algebras  .",
    "this apparatus provides a physical interpretation for the theory , in particular for the doubling  @xcite , and opens several possibilities for the study of thermal effects  @xcite .",
    "these algebraic developments include perturbative schemes and classical representations  , with applications to a variety of systems  .",
    "a distinguishing feature of thermal theories is that , due to the kms condition , the final prescription of the matsubara or tfd formalism may be regarded as a compactification of the time coordinate .",
    "this corresponds to a field theory on the topology @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a circumference of length @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the temperature , describing the time compactification , and @xmath31 stands for @xmath32 space - like coordinates . in this section",
    ", we review some basic elements of the thermal quantum field theory , emphasizing such topological aspects .",
    "let us start with the standard definition of the statistical average of an observable @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34=\\frac{1}{z(\\beta ) } \\text{tr}\\ [ e^{-\\beta h}a],\\label{dec20111}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , the partition function , is given by @xmath36 tr@xmath37 , where @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the temperature and @xmath38 the hamiltonian .",
    "we use natural units , such that @xmath39 . in this section , for simplicity , we restrict to the boson field .",
    "an important result regarding the nature of the canonical ( or the grand canonical ) ensemble is the kubo - matin - schwinger ( kms ) condition , stating that the statistical average of an operator in the heisenberg picture , @xmath40 , is periodic in time with a period given by @xmath41 .",

    "this solution , the thermal feynman propagator , is a direct consequence of the kms condition and is unique , since the periodic boundary condition and the feynman contour are respected .",
    "the normalized generating functions for this green function is @xmath59=\\exp\\left [   \\frac{i}{2}\\int d^{d}xd^{d}y\\,j(x)g_{0}% ( x - y;\\beta)j(y)\\right ]   , \\label{cbpf22122}%\\ ] ] where @xmath60}{\\delta j(x)\\delta j(y)}|_{j=0}.\\ ] ] reproducing the basic result of the gibbs formalism .    using the notion of spectral function ,",
    "as discussed by kadanoff and baym  @xcite , dolan and jackiw  @xcite managed to write the thermal propagator in a fourier - integral representation , thus restoring time as a real quantity .",
    "the basic result is that the fourier - series representation , given in eq .",

    "then we have @xmath66    it is important to emphasize the following aspect . the thermal green function for the free - boson field",
    "is given in eq .",
    "( [ 8propmat1 ] ) , satisfying eq .  ( [ cbpf15121 ] ) , the klein - gordon equation , and the kms boundary - condition .",
    "since the klein - gordon equation expresses an isometry locally in space - time , such results are equivalent to writing the klein - gordon field on a toroidal topology @xmath67 , where @xmath28 describes the compactification in the imaginary time coordinate in a circle of circumference @xmath68 .",
    "this interpretation is valid not only for free - fields , but also for interacting fields .",
    "since the topology maintains the nature of the local interaction , the feynman diagrams in @xmath69 theory are the same except by the following redefinition in the expression of the propagators . in other words ,",
    "the feynman rules in the momentum space are modified by taking , for the time - like compactified dimension , the integrals in momentum space replaced by sums as@xmath70 with @xmath71 for bosons , and @xmath72 for fermions .",
    "there are two versions for a real - time finite - temperature quantum field theory .",
    "one was formulated by schwinger and keldysh  @xcite , which is based on using a path in the complex time plane  @xcite .",
    "the other is the thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) proposed by takahashi and umezawa  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the thermal theory is constructed on a hilbert space and thermal effects are introduced by a bogoliubov transformation  @xcite . in equilibrium , these two real - time formalisms are the same  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on basic elements of the tfd approach , emphasizing that a real - time formalism is a theory on the topology @xmath73 .      for a system in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the ensemble average of an operator @xmath33 is given by @xmath74 .",

    "first , these studies have been considered in detail elsewhere ; second , we were foreseeing applications specifically in particles and condensed matter physics , having quantum fields as a starting point .    due to its nature , the toroidal topology is such that the local properties of the space - time are kept invariant , as the casimir invariants of the lie - algebra .",
