    "in a previous paper @xcite it was shown that the polarization observables in inclusive scattering of high energy deuterons by protons at zero scattering angle , are sensitive to the ratio @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the cross sections of absorption of virtual isoscalar photons with longitudinal and transversal polarizations by nucleons . in the framework of the @xmath9exchange mechanism for the considered reaction , it was found that this sensitivity is especially large in the region of @xmath10-excitations with masses @xmath11 gev , for @xmath12 .",
    "this interval is especially interesting when compared with the data obtained by inclusive @xmath13scattering .",
    "this sensitivity is due , in particular , to the properties of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors . in @xcite",
    "a simplified assumption was used , namely , the ratio @xmath14 was taken to be a free parameter independent of the four momentum transfer square , @xmath15 .",
    "the value that best fitted the data was @xmath16 .",
    "it is then interesting to compare this value with that of a realistic model for the nucleon resonances electroexcitation . in this work we present the results of the analysis of polarization phenomena in @xmath17 , using the predictions of the model @xcite for the @xmath18-dependence of the isoscalar form factors of electromagnetic @xmath19transitions .",
    "we show that hadronic probes of nucleon structure , in particular , using polarized particles , may give interesting and important information concerning form factors of @xmath10-excitations .",
    "the selectivity of reactions such as @xmath20 or @xmath21 to the isoscalar part of the @xmath10-electroexcitation makes these processes complementary to electron - nucleon inelastic scattering , for the study of the @xmath10-structure .",
    "note that in the framework of the @xmath1-exchange model @xcite , all polarization phenomena for @xmath17 can be predicted without any free parameters , using only existing information about the deuteron electromagnetic form factors and about the ratio @xmath14 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ii",
    "we give the @xmath18-dependence of the tensor analyzing power @xmath22 and @xmath14 in the model [ 1 ] .",
    "formulas for transverse and longitudinal amplitudes of the algebraic collective model [ 2 - 4 ] are recalled in section iii .",
    "results and discussions are presented in section iv and the conclusions are drawn in section v.    [ [ section ] ]    we will analyze here the polarization phenomena in the process @xmath23 , for forward deuteron scattering , in the framework of the model @xcite based on @xmath9exchange ( fig .",
    "the @xmath1-meson is preferred , among the isoscalar mesons as @xmath24 or @xmath25 , for several reasons .",
    "the @xmath26 coupling is large ; the @xmath1-meson , being a spin 1 particle , can induce strong polarization effects and an energy - independent cross section .",
    "when considered as an @xmath27 , then the cross sections and the polarization observables can be calculated from the known electromagnetic properties of the deuteron and @xmath10 , through the vector dominance model .",
    "these special properties of the @xmath9exchange mechanism allow an experimental test of the validity of this model , similar to the rosenbluth test of the one - photon mechanism , in case of elastic and inelastic electron - hadron scattering .",
    "the details of the model are described in @xcite .",
    "we will recall here only the final expressions , necessary for the present analysis .",
    "the tensor analyzing power in @xmath17 , @xmath22 , can be written in terms of the electromagnetic form factors as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are related to the standard electromagnetic deuteron form factors : @xmath32 ( electric ) , @xmath33 ( magnetic ) and @xmath34 ( quadrupole ) by : @xmath35,\\ ] ] and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the deuteron mass .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 characterizes the relative role of longitudinal and transversal isoscalar excitations in the transition @xmath38 . in case of the roper excitation we can write : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the longitudinal ( transversal ) form factor of the @xmath41-excitation on proton ( @xmath42 ) or neutron ( @xmath43 ) targets .",
    "this formula can be generalized to the excitation of any nucleon resonance @xmath10 as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the two possible transversal form factors , corresponding to total @xmath47 helicity equal to @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .    in case of overlapping resonances , taking into account the finite values of the resonance widths , eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be generalized to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a breit - wigner function for the @xmath52-resonance with a definite normalization : @xmath53 @xmath54 is the nucleon mass , @xmath55 is the pion mass and @xmath56 is the effective invariant mass of the @xmath57system in @xmath17 ( i.e. the mass of the resonance ) .",
    "let us mention that for forward deuteron scattering in @xmath17 the variables @xmath18 and @xmath56 are not independent , for a fixed energy of the incoming deuteron there is a definite correspondance between @xmath18 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the following observations , based on eq .",
    "( 1 ) , can be made .",
    "all information about the @xmath58-vertex is contained in the function @xmath14 only .",
    "@xmath22 is especially sensitive to the small value of @xmath59 in the interval @xmath60 .",
    "a zero value of @xmath14 results in a @xmath5independent value for @xmath22 , namely @xmath61 , for any value of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors . the position of the points at @xmath62  @xmath63 and @xmath64  @xmath63 , ( with @xmath65 ) , at which all theoretical curves for different @xmath14 intersect , is determined by the models used for the deuteron form factors . in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath5dependence of @xmath14 , calculated on the basis of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , for two different cases : ( i ) considering the contribution of only the roper resonance ( dotted line ) , ( ii ) considering the sum of the contributions of the following resonances @xmath66 which are overlapping in this mass region ( solid line ) .",
    "the form factors of the @xmath10-excitations on proton and neutron targets were derived using an algebraic collective model @xcite , some details of which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "this will then allow to understand the behaviour of the ratio @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "the formulas for transverse and longitudinal helicity amplitudes used in the present work , are based on the collective string model of baryons @xcite , assuming @xmath67 symmetry . in this model",
    "the nucleon resonances are interpreted in terms of rotations and vibrations of a y - shaped string configuration with a prescribed distribution of charges and magnetization .",
    "the underlying algebraic structure of the model enables a derivation of closed expressions for masses , electromagnetic and strong couplings of baryon resonances .",
    "electromagnetic transverse and longitudinal form factors on proton and neutron targets for nucleon resonances below 2 gev are shown in tables i - ii as a function of the photon momentum @xmath68 .",
    "the parameters relevant to these observables are the constituent mass , @xmath69 gev , magnetic moment , @xmath70 gev@xmath71 ( g - factor @xmath72=1 ) , and a scale parameter of the distribution , @xmath73 fm .",
    "the state of the resonance is recalled in table ii only .    as seen from table ii , of the four resonances mentioned in ( 6 )",
    ", only the roper resonance has a nonzero isoscalar longitudinal form factor .",
    "all other three resonances can not be excited by isoscalar longitudinal virtual photons .",
    "the longitudinal amplitudes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 vanish because of spin - flavor symmetry , while both isoscalar and isovector longitudinal couplings of @xmath74 and @xmath75 vanish identically .",
    "this behavior of the isoscalar form factors is essential for the correct description of the existing experimental data on the @xmath5dependence of @xmath22 for the process @xmath17 .",
    "the longitudinal isoscalar ( @xmath76 ) form factor of the roper resonance in the collective - string model of @xcite is , apart from an overall constant , @xmath77 this form factor has a zero at @xmath78 .",
    "this is also the zero of @xmath14 seen in fig .",
    "2 . the location of the zero depends on the value of @xmath79 , which in turn characterizes the size of the string configuration .",
    "an accurate determination of the location of the zero for the transition form factor from the @xmath5dependence of @xmath22 could therefore provide an independent measure of the transition radius of the roper resonance . in particular , it could shed some light on the question whether or not hadrons swell with increasing excitation energy .",
    "the latter can be studied within the collective - string model @xcite by introducing the stretchability of the string @xmath80 via the ansatz @xmath81 with @xmath82 fm .",
    "the calculations reported below are performed in the breit frame for which @xmath83 from eq .",
    "( 9 ) , one can see that @xmath68 depends not only on @xmath18 , but on @xmath56 too .",
    "in fig . 3 we report the theoretical predictions , using eq .",
    "( 3 ) , together with the existing experimental data . in such an approximation",
    ", @xmath22 is a universal function of @xmath18 only , without any dependence on the initial deuteron momentum .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath22 for @xmath84 @xcite , for different momenta of the incident beam are shown as open symbols .",
    "these data show a scaling as a function of @xmath18 , with a small dependence on the incident momentum in the interval 3.79 gev / c . on the same plot the data for the elastic scattering process",
    "@xmath85 @xcite are shown ( filled stars ) .",
    "all these data show a very similar behavior : negative values , with a minimum in the region @xmath86 and an increase towards zero at larger @xmath87 .",
    "the lines are the result of the @xmath1-exchange model calculation for the @xmath17 process . the dashed - dotted line correspond to @xmath88 ,",
    "i.e. to @xmath61 as mentioned previously .",
    "calculations based on the algebraic collective model @xcite are shown for the case when only the roper resonance is considered ( dotted line ) and for the case when all the four resonances ( 6 ) are considered ( solid line ) .",
    "the required deuteron form factors , @xmath89 , were taken from @xcite ( calculated in a relativistic impulse approximation ) and they reproduce well the @xmath90data for @xmath91 elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "when @xmath92 or if the contribution of the deuteron magnetic form factor @xmath93 is neglected , then @xmath22 does not depend on the ratio @xmath14 , and coincides with @xmath94 for the elastic @xmath91-scattering ( with the same approximation ) .    from fig .",
    "3 it appears that the @xmath5behavior of @xmath22 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath14 , at relatively small @xmath14 , @xmath95 .",
    "the values of @xmath14 , predicted by the collective model @xcite give a good description of the data , when taking into account the contribution of all four resonances ( 6 ) .",
    "these data , in any case , exclude a very small value of @xmath96 as well as very large values of @xmath14 .",
    "such sensitivity of @xmath22 for @xmath17 to the ratio of the corresponding isoscalar form factors of the @xmath10-excitation clearly indicates the presence of the roper resonance in this process .",
    "such an indication was hardly found in the differential cross section for inclusive scattering with unpolarized particles @xcite .    in the framework of the @xmath1-exchange mechanism , electromagnetic isovector components of the @xmath19 transition can not contribute .",
    "this is important as the other resonances in this mass region , @xmath97 are essentially isovector in the collective model @xcite ( as well as in other quark models ) , so the isoscalar longitudinal form factors for @xmath19 are identically zero for any value of @xmath18 .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 contains ( in the numerator ) the contribution of only the roper resonance .",
    "it is this specific property of the roper resonance ( combined with the @xmath5dependence of the deuteron form factors ) that induces the specific @xmath5behavior of the isoscalar ratio @xmath14 and of the analyzing power @xmath22 as shown in figs . 2 and 3 , repectively .    in this connection , we mention that the @xmath1-exchange model predicts the general features of the polarization observables .",
    "for example , the crossing of all the theoretical curves for @xmath22 at two points , is determined by the relative value of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors . for any model of @xmath14",
    "we will have @xmath98 in the region @xmath99",
    "@xmath63 . future data from jefferson lab @xcite , concerning @xmath22 in @xmath85 will help in defining the exact position of these points . for @xmath100  @xmath63",
    ", @xmath22 can not be positive .    using the generalized formula , eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the @xmath5behavior of the ratio @xmath59 depends on the initial deuteron momentum . from fig .",
    "4 one can see that , in the interval 3.79 gev / c this dependence is not so large , in agreement with experimental data .",
    "this is also true for the momentum dependence of @xmath22 , ( fig .",
    "the agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data is generally good , at least for @xmath101 2 @xmath63 .",
    "of course , this model for @xmath102 can be improved , taking into account for example , other meson exchanges , or the effects of the strong interaction in initial and final states . however these corrections are strongly model- and parameter- dependent ; the existing experimental data are not good enough to constrain the additional parameters which have to be added . in this case",
    "we lose the predictive power of our `` parameter free '' model .",
    "the successful description of the polarization observable @xmath22 can be considered as a strong indication that the @xmath9 exchange is the main mechanism for the considered process .",
    "we analyzed also the sensitivity to a possible stretching mechanism @xcite , leading to the swelling of hadrons with increasing excitation energy .",
    "we use the parameterization of eq .",
    "( 8) for the scale parameter @xmath79 , with @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( the last value is consistent with the analysis of the experimental mass spectra , regge trajectories ) .",
    "the results are reported in figs . 6 and 8 for @xmath59 and figs . 7 and 9 for @xmath22 , for the different values of initial deuteron momentum .",
    "the behavior of @xmath59 is seen to be very sensitive to @xmath80 .",
    "introduction of swelling gives a more negative slope to @xmath22 in better agreement with experiment although the position of the minimum at @xmath105= 3.7 and 9 gev / c is still shifted to higher @xmath106 values compared to that measured by the data .",
    "similar results can be obtained for other polarization observables . in fig .",
    "10 we show the @xmath5dependence of the vector polarization transfer coefficient , @xmath107 , from the initial to the scattered deuteron .",
    "it is characterized by a strong sensitivity to the ratio @xmath14 for @xmath108  @xmath63 .",
    "this observable is especially interesting in this region , because @xmath22 vanishes around @xmath109  @xmath63 ( for any value of @xmath14 ) .",
    "our calculations predict quite a large absolute value of this observable and a strong dependence on the variable @xmath18 .",
    "let us note in this connection , that , all t - even polarization observables are nonzero and large in absolute value .",
    "this is an intrinsic property of @xmath1-exchange .",
    "in contrast , all t - odd polarization effects cancel , because we neglected the effects of strong interaction in initial and final states .",
    "however , for collinear kinematics , all spin - one t - odd polarization observables must be zero , in any model .",
    "the most simple t - odd polarization observable , which exists in the general case for the collinear kinematics , corresponds to the correlation coefficient @xmath110 , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the unit vector along the initial 3-momentum , @xmath113 is the proton polarization and @xmath114 is the deuteron tensor polarization .",
    "a measurement of these observables will give a direct information on the presence and intensity of the final or initial strong interaction .",
    "the tensor analyzing power @xmath22 , being a t - even observable , is less sensitive to the effects of strong interaction in initial and final states , as these effects induce ` quadratic corrections ' to any t - even polarization observable .",
    "we can schematically write : @xmath115=@xmath116 , where @xmath115 is any t - even polarization observable and @xmath117 represents the correction due to rescattering effects .",
    "any t - odd polarization observable , @xmath118 , is directly proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "we have shown the sensitivity of the tensor analyzing power in the process @xmath23 ( for forward deuteron scattering ) to the relative value of the cross sections for the absorption of virtual isoscalar photon ( @xmath119 ) with longitudinal and transversal polarizations .",
    "the main point is that only the roper resonance excitation is characterized by a nonzero isoscalar longitudinal form factor , whose @xmath5behavior drives the @xmath5dependence of the tensor analyzing power .",
    "the other resonances , lying in this mass region , such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are characterized , due to the specific quark structure , by a pure isovector nature of longitudinal virtual photons absorbed by nucleons . without excitation of the roper resonance , @xmath120 , and the value for @xmath22",
    "becomes @xmath5independent : @xmath121 , in evident disagreement with existing data .",
    "the specific behavior of @xmath14 obtained in the framework of the collective model @xcite for the roper resonance , and in the presence of other resonances , with a definite isotopic structure , are very important for obtaining a good description of the data . in the framework of the @xmath9exchange mechanism , the @xmath5behavior of @xmath22 for the reaction @xmath122 ,",
    "is affected , on one side , from the specific @xmath5 dependence of all three deuteron electromagnetic form factors , and on the other side , from the values of @xmath14 when all four overlapping resonances @xmath123 contribute .",
    "the main property is the role of the roper resonance excitation , with nonzero longitudinal isoscalar form factor .",
    "also to be noticed is that the sensitivity of @xmath22 to @xmath14 is especially large for @xmath14 in the interval @xmath124 , which is in agreement with the data on inclusive @xmath125-scattering at these values of excitation energy .",
    "our model predicts a small momentum dependence for @xmath22 , consistent with the experimental data .",
    "the results are also stable with respect to the parameter @xmath80 , the stretchability of the nucleon string , in the range @xmath126 .",
    "the study of polarization observables in the reaction @xmath17 can be considered as an additional method to measure the @xmath5dependence of the ratio @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the process @xmath127x is sensitive to the isoscalar contributions to @xmath14 .",
    "the vector polarization transfer coefficient @xmath107 is also sensitive to this ratio , in a different region of @xmath18 .",
    "we can consider the existing data about @xmath22 not only as an evidence for the roper resonance excitation , but also as a tool to study properties of isoscalar form factors for the excitation of @xmath10 resonances , complementary to the inelastic electron - nucleon scattering , @xmath128 .",
    "the possibility to unify in a common picture such different processes , as @xmath129 and @xmath128 , from one side , and a hadronic process as @xmath17 from another side , suggests a new perspective to study nucleon structure through electromagnetic and hadron excitation of nucleonic resonances .",
    "at large energies of colliding particles , instead of @xmath9exchange it is necessary to consider pomeron ( @xmath130 ) exchange , i.e. the mechanism of diffractive excitation of @xmath10 , in @xmath131-forward scattering .",
    "concerning polarization phenomena , the properties of @xmath1 and @xmath130- are similar .",
    "but in the general case , the vertexes of @xmath132 and @xmath133-interactions are different from @xmath134 and @xmath135-vertexes : only in the framework of the hypothesis about _ pomeron - photon analogy _ , the prediction of these models coincide , at least concerning polarization phenomena .",
