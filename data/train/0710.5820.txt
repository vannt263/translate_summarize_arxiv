    "such a description contains already the principle of permutability of such transformations , which follows from the following observation  @xcite .",
    "assume the following splitting of the data of the vectorial fundamental transformation @xmath266 associated with the partition @xmath267 , which implies the following splitting of the potentials @xmath268 @xmath269 then the vectorial fundamental transformation is equivalent to the following superposition of vectorial fundamental transformations : + 1 ) transformation @xmath270 with the data @xmath271 , @xmath272 and the corresponding potentials @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 @xmath276 2 ) application on the result the vectorial fundamental transformation with the transformed data @xmath277 and potentials @xmath278 i.e. , @xmath279^{-1 } { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\boldsymbol{y}^b , h)^{\\{a\\}}.\\ ] ]    the same result @xmath280 is obtained exchanging the order of transformations , exchanging also the indices @xmath281 and @xmath282 in formulas - .      in this section",
    "we describe restrictions on the data of the fundamental transformation in order to preserve the reduction from ql to cql . as usually ( see , for example @xcite )",
    "a reduction of the fundamental transformation for a special quadrilateral lattice mimics the geometric properties of the lattice .",

    "we study restrictions of the data of the vectorial fundamental transformation , which are compatible with the cql reduction . in that part",
    "we follow the corresponding results of @xcite ( see also proposition 4.9 of @xcite ) .",
    "then we show the corresponding permutability property of the transformation .",
    "given a solution @xmath321 of the adjoint linear problem for the c - quadrilateral lattice whose rotation coefficients satisfy the cql constraint then @xmath322 provides a vectorial solution of the linear problem , and the corresponding potential @xmath323 allows for the following constraint @xmath324 with such a data the transformed lattice @xmath325 given by is c - quadrilateral lattice as well .",
    "in @xcite , instead of relation it was used more general relation @xmath326 where @xmath327 is an arbitrary linear operator .",
    "then also the constraint had to be replaced by @xmath328 which is however equivalent , up to initial data , to due to @xmath329 moreover , because ( up to initial value ) @xmath330 , and @xmath331 the final result is independent of ( non - degenerate ) @xmath327 .",
    "the fundamental vectorial transform given by with the data restricted by conditions and can be considered as the superposition of @xmath265 ( scalar ) discrete cql reduced fundamental transforms .    for @xmath332",
    "we obtain the cql reduction of the fundamental transformation in the setting of proposition  [ prop : cql - fund ] ( with @xmath318 ) . for @xmath333",
    "the statement follows from the standard reasoning applied to superposition of two reduced vectorial fundamental transformations ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "assume the splitting @xmath334 and the induced splitting @xmath335 of the basic data @xmath336 of the transformation .",
    "then we have also @xmath337 and ( in the shorthand notation , compare equations - ) @xmath338 while the constraint reads @xmath339 by straightforward algebra , using equations , one checks that the transformed data satisfy the cql constraints and as well , i.e. , @xmath340 which concludes the proof .    in the case with matrix @xmath327 as in previous remark , the scalar components of the vectorial transformation do not satisfy ( unless @xmath327 is diagonal ) the cql reduction condition of proposition  [ prop : cql - fund ] .    because the cql - reduced fundamental transformation can be considered as construction of new levels of the c - quadrilateral lattice , then if we denote by @xmath341 the c - quadrilateral lattice obtained by superposition of two ( scalar ) such transforms from @xmath146 to @xmath342 and @xmath343 , then for each direction @xmath28 of the lattice the hexahedra with basic vertices @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath342 and @xmath343 are c - hexahedra .",
    "similarly , if we consider superpositions of three ( scalar ) transforms of the c - quadrilateral lattice @xmath146 then the hexahedra with basic vertices @xmath146 , @xmath342 , @xmath343 and @xmath344 are c - hexahedra .",
    "we presented new geometric interpretation of the discrete ckp equation within the theory of quadrilateral lattices .",
    "the paper should be considered as supplementary to @xcite .",
    "it has been also written in a format similar to @xcite , where we presented novel geometric interpretation of the discrete bkp equation .",
    "results of the paper show once again the fundamental role of the incidence geometry structures in the integrable geometry .",
    "we remark that the integrability of the discrete bkp equations was a consequence of the mbius theorem on mutually inscribed tetrahedrons , and the integrability of the discrete ckp equations was a consequence of the gallucci theorem .",
    "however , it turns out @xcite that both theorems are two diferent faces of a more fundamental result concerning the so called quadrangular sets of points .    in the appendix we present the theory of the darboux maps within the quadrilateral lattice theory thus showing the fundamental role of the quadrilateral lattice in integrable discrete geometry",

    "it is termed a discrete darboux map if the four images of the edges of any face of the @xmath346 lattice are collinear , i.e. , there exist functions @xmath349 , @xmath350 , such that @xmath351 compatibility of equations implies @xcite that the functions @xmath352 satisfy the discrete darboux equations .",
    "in order to use the darboux equations in the form the definition of @xmath352 in this paper is shifted with respect to that used in @xcite .",
    "we will briefly demonstrate that the darboux maps can be interpreted as suitably rescaled normalized backward tangent vectors @xmath46 ; compare figure [ fig : back ] with figure [ fig : darboux - map ] , where also the geometric construction of the darboux map is given .",
    "consider the quadrilateral lattice @xmath353 together with its backward tangent vectors @xmath46 and the corresponding backward rotation coefficients @xmath51 .",

    "geometrically , by results of appendix a1 of @xcite , it means that @xmath359 and @xmath362 represent mutual laplace transforms @xcite in the affine gauge , i.e. @xmath359 , @xmath363 , @xmath362 and @xmath364 are collinear and satisfy equation of the form of .",
    "the above result can be reversed , i.e. , any darboux map gives rise via equations and to a system of normalized backward tangent vectors of a quadrilateral lattice .",
    "thus the correspondence between darboux maps and quadrilateral lattices occurs on the geometric linear level .",
    "notice that the functions @xmath354 satisfy the forward adjoint linear problem with the rotation coefficients @xmath51 which satisfy the mql equations . then without any calculation",
