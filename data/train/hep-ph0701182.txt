    "neutrino oscillations between two flavors in vacuum are governed by the frequency @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy of a given mode .",
    "therefore , if the energy spectrum is broad , the energy dependence of the oscillation frequency quickly leads to kinematical decoherence , i.e. , along a neutrino beam the overall flavor content quickly approaches an average value .",
    "the situation changes radically when neutrinos themselves provide a significant refractive effect , leading to collective oscillation modes  @xcite that can be of practical interest in the early universe  @xcite or in core - collapse supernovae  @xcite . defining the parameter @xmath2 the neutrino gas is `` dense '' when @xmath3 , i.e. , when a typical neutrino - neutrino interaction energy exceeds the energy corresponding to the vacuum oscillation frequency .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , collective effects are important , even if the ordinary matter effect is much larger than that from the neutrino - neutrino interaction  @xcite .",
    "one characteristic feature of collective oscillations is the phenomenon of `` self - maintained coherence ''  @xcite , meaning that all modes oscillate with the same frequency even though the energy spectrum may be broad .",
    "it was recently stressed , however , that this is not the complete story  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting case for collective effects is provided by neutrinos streaming off a supernova core , a situation that is far from isotropic .",
    "the current - current nature of the weak - interaction hamiltonian implies that the interaction energy between particles of momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the velocity .",
    "if the medium is isotropic , the @xmath8 term averages to zero , but if there is a net current , test particles moving in different directions experience different refractive effects . therefore , neutrinos moving in a background with a net current will decohere between different directions of motion , even if the energy spectrum is monochromatic .",
    "to avoid confusion about terminology we stress that we always mean `` kinematical decoherence '' when we say `` decoherence . ''",
    "different modes oscillate differently , leading to `` de - phasing '' and thus to the depolarization of the overall ensemble .",
    "if we use the common language of polarization vectors @xmath9 for each mode @xmath4 , then the length of each @xmath9 is conserved , whereas the length of the overall polarization vector @xmath10 shrinks ( kinematical decoherence ) or is conserved ( kinematical coherence ) .",
    "the effect of _ dynamical _ decoherence , caused by collisions among the neutrinos or with a thermal background medium , is that each individual polarization vector @xmath9 shrinks , i.e. , neutrinos in individual modes can not be represented as pure states .",
    "this effect , relevant for open quantum systems , does not occur in our case where oscillations are the only form of evolution .",
    "the multi - angle decoherence effect becomes nontrivial in the most interesting case when the `` background current '' consists of the neutrinos themselves as for neutrinos streaming off a supernova core .",
    "numerical examples reveal significant decoherence effects , but on the other hand they also show collective modes very similar to the isotropic ( `` single - angle '' ) case  @xcite .",
    "the overall behavior is determined by a complicated interplay between the collective evolution and decoherence .    rather than trying to understand the supernova case in its full complexity , we here take the opposite approach and study the simplest example that shows decoherence caused by the neutrino - neutrino multi - angle effect .",
    "therefore , we consider a dense neutrino gas that is monochromatic , symmetric ( equal @xmath11 and @xmath12 densities ) , and homogeneous , but not isotropic .",
    "even this simple model has a rich phenomenology that helps one to develop a better understanding of the full problem . on the other hand ,",
    "it is simple enough that the most puzzling aspects of its behavior are analytically tractable .    a symmetric @xmath13 gas oscillates in the `` bipolar mode '' where pairs of neutrinos of a given flavor coherently oscillate into the other flavor and back with the `` bipolar frequency ''  @xcite @xmath14 as an example we consider a dense neutrino gas initially consisting of @xmath15 and assume that the mixing angle @xmath16 with another flavor is small , a situation that could represent 13-oscillations .",
    "we characterize the overall flavor content of the ensemble in the usual way by a polarization vector where the positive @xmath17-direction corresponds to the @xmath18-flavor whereas the mass direction is defined by a unit vector that we call @xmath19 .",
    "it is tilted against the @xmath17-direction by @xmath20 and we always choose it to lie in the @xmath21-@xmath17-plane with @xmath22 for the normal hierarchy and @xmath23 for the inverted hierarchy .    in vacuum ,",
    "the polarization vectors precess around @xmath19 with frequency @xmath24 . in a dense neutrino gas with @xmath25 , their motion",
    "is largely confined to the @xmath21-@xmath17-plane where they perform pendular motions with frequency @xmath26 and where @xmath27 is the `` force direction . ''",
    "the maximum excursion is @xmath20 , indicated by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] where we show the trajectory in the @xmath21-@xmath17-plane .",
    "for the normal hierarchy , the pendulum swings between the dotted lines . for the inverted hierarchy ( bottom ) , it performs almost full - circle oscillations as indicated by the diamonds .",
    "if the gas is not isotropic , the picture changes completely . taking the `` half - isotropic '' case as a generic example where only one half - space of momentum modes is occupied ( neutrinos streaming off a plane surface ) , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory ] the trajectory of the average polarization vector .",
    "for both hierarchies , its length shrinks to zero so that the final state of the ensemble is an equal mixture of both flavors .",
    "in other words , the ensemble quickly decoheres , independently of the mass hierarchy .",
    "this behavior is perhaps intuitive because we have assumed a large neutrino current .",
    "however , this effect is self - accelerating in that it is triggered even by the smallest nonzero anisotropy . whereas for perfect isotropy",
    "the neutrino - neutrino interaction provides for self - maintained coherence between modes of different energy , even an infinitesimal anisotropy has the opposite effect of causing self - induced decoherence between modes with different propagation directions .",
    "the average flavor content of the ensemble always approaches an equal mixture of both flavors .",
    "this instability is a nonlinear effect caused by the neutrino - neutrino interaction .",
    "in other words , the pendular motion of the isotropic ensemble is an unstable limit cycle , whereas the equal flavor mixture is a stable fixed point .",

    "<S> dense neutrino gases exhibit collective oscillations where `` self - maintained coherence '' is a characteristic feature , i.e. , neutrinos of different energies oscillate with the same frequency . in a non - isotropic gas , however , the flux term of the neutrino - neutrino interaction has the opposite effect of causing kinematical decoherence of neutrinos propagating in different directions , an effect that is at the origin of the `` multi - angle behavior '' of neutrinos streaming off a supernova core . </S>",
    "<S> we cast the equations of motion in a form where the role of the flux term is manifest . </S>",
