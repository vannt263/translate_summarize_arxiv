    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions reached great interest since the related experimental measurements are improved at present . among them ,",
    "the lepton flavor changes in z decays , such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are important for the search of neutrinos , their mixing and possible masses , and the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . with the giga - z option of the tesla project",
    ", the production of z bosons at resonance is expected to increase @xcite and this forces to study on such z decays more precisely .",
    "since the lepton flavor is conserved in the sm , one needs an extended theory to describe the lepton flavor violating z decays .",
    "one of the possibility is the extension of the sm , so called @xmath7sm , by taking neutrinos massive and permitting the lepton mixing mechanism @xcite . in this case",
    "the lepton sector is analogous to the quark sector . considering the branching ratio ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 the first predictions for such z decays",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "the best experimental limits obtained at lep 1 @xcite are @xmath10 and with the improved sensitivities at giga - z @xcite these numbers could be pulled down to @xmath11 with @xmath12 . in the framework of @xmath7sm with light neutrinos",
    "the theoretical prediction is extremely small and far from these limits @xcite @xmath13 another possiblity to increase the corresponding @xmath8 is the extension of the @xmath7sm with one heavy ordinary dirac neutrino @xcite .",
    "heavy neutrinos are expected in string - inspired models @xcite and some guts @xcite . in the @xmath7sm with one heavy neutrino ,",
    "it is necessary to include a heavy charged lepton in the theory . in the famework of this model ,",
    "its is possible to observe their effects from z decays if the neutrinos with a mass of several hundered gev exist .",
    "further scenario to increase the @xmath8 is the @xmath7sm extended with two heavy right - handed singlet majorana neutrinos @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is possible to reach the experimental upper limits in the large neutrino mass region .",
    "lepton flavor violating z decays are also studied in the framework of the zee model @xcite . according to this work , among all three lepton flavor violating decay modes of z , only @xmath14 decay has the largest contribution which is less than the present limits .",
    "other two decays are small to be observed in the next linear colliders .    in our work ,",
    "we study @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays in the model iii version of 2hdm , which is the minimal extension of the sm .",
    "since there is no ckm type matrix and therefore no charged fc interaction in the leptonic sector according to our assumption , the source of lepton flavor violating z decays are the neutral higgs bosons @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the yukawa couplings which allow tree level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "the choice of complex yukawa couplings brings the possibility of non - zero electric dipole moments ( edm ) of leptons and this ensures to restrict the yukawa couplings using the present experimental limits .",
    "further the lepton flavor violating interaction @xmath20 is possible in this model and can be used to predict the constraint for the yukawa couplings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "calculations are done in one loop level and it is shown that the experimental upper limits for z decays underconsideration can be reached by playing with the free parameters of the model iii respecting the above restrictions .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the explicit expressions for the branching ratios of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the framework of the model iii .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "in the sm and the model i and ii version of 2hdm the fcnc at tree level is forbidden . however model iii version of 2hdm permits fcnc interactions at tree level and makes flavor violating interactions possible . with the choice of complex yukawa couplings , the cp violation can also exist and this leads to appearence of non - zero edm of fermions . the yukawa interaction for the leptonic sector in the model iii is @xmath25 where @xmath26 are family indices of leptons , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote chiral projections @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 , are the two scalar doublets , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are lepton doublets and singlets respectively . here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are chosen as @xmath36\\ , ;   \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c }   \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h_1+i h_2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\",
    ", , \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the vacuum expectation values are @xmath37 this choice ensures that the sm particles are collected in the first doublet and the ones beyond in the second doublet .",
    "the part which produce fcnc at tree level is @xmath38 here the yukawa matrices @xmath39 have in general complex entries .",
    "note that in the following we replace @xmath40 with @xmath41 where `` n '' denotes the word `` neutral '' and define @xmath42 which satisfies the equation @xmath43 . in our analysis , we take @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( see eq .",
    "( [ choice ] ) ) as the mass eigenstates @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively since no mixing between cp - even neutral higgs bosons @xmath18 and the sm one , @xmath46 , occurs at tree level .",
    "the general effective vertex for the interaction of on - shell z - boson with a fermionic current is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the momentum transfer , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is vector ( axial - vector ) coupling , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) magnetic ( electric ) transitions of unlike fermions .",

    "the necessary 1-loop diagrams due to neutral higgs particles are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1ver ] .",
    "taking into account all the masses of internal leptons and external lepton ( anti - lepton ) , the explicit expressions for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 read as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in eq .",
    "( [ etava ] ) the flavor changing couplings @xmath63 represent the effective interaction between the internal lepton @xmath64 , ( @xmath65 ) and outgoing ( incoming ) @xmath66 one . here",
    "we take @xmath63 complex in general and use the parametrization @xmath67 where @xmath68 denote the lepton flavors and @xmath69 are cp violating parameters which are the sources of the lepton edm .    now , using the couplings @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 the br for @xmath70 can be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the total decay width of z boson .",
    "note that , in general , the production of sum of charged states is considered with the corresponding br @xmath74 and in our numerical analysis we use this branching ratio .",
    "in the model iii , there are number of free parameters such as the masses of charged and neutral higgs bosons , complex yukawa couplings .",
    "the yukawa couplings in the lepton sector are @xmath75 and they should be restricted by present and forthcoming experiments .",
    "the first assumption is that @xmath76 , are small compared to @xmath77 since the strength of these couplings are related with the masses of leptons denoted by the indices of them , similar to the cheng - sher scenario @xcite .",
    "second we assume that @xmath78 is symmetric with respect to the indices @xmath64 and @xmath79 .",
    "in our work we study on the decays @xmath15 , @xmath80 and @xmath17 . in the case of @xmath15 decay",
    "we need the couplings @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath65 . here",
    "we use the first asssumption and neglect the contributions of @xmath83 where @xmath84 , by taking only the internal @xmath85 lepton into account .",
    "now , we should restrict @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath88 we use the constraint coming from the experimental limits of @xmath89 lepton edm @xcite , @xmath90 ( see @xcite for details ) .    for the restriction of the coupling @xmath88 , the deviation of the anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) of muon over its sm prediction @xcite due to the the recent experimental result of muon amm by g-2 collaboration @xcite , can also be used . however , amm of muon is posssible in the model iii even for vanishing complex yukawa couplings . in the lfv @xmath91 decay , the part which depends on the couplings @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see eq .",
    "( [ etava ] ) ) is non - vanishing when the complex yukawa couplings are permitted in the model . here , we choose edm of muon since the restriction is sensitive to complex phases , existing also in the @xmath91 decay .",
    "the coupling @xmath94 is restricted using the experimental upper limit of the @xmath8 of the process @xmath95 and the above constraint for @xmath88 , since @xmath95 decay can be used to fix the yukawa combination @xmath96 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this ensures us to determine the upper and lower limits of the coupling @xmath94 .",
    "the maximum value of the br(@xmath97 ) is calculated by taking the combination @xmath98 , which respects the upper bound of @xmath95 decay . for the minimum value of br(@xmath99 ) , we use the combination @xmath98 if each coupling is at its minimum value .",
    "in fact , this minimum value is artificial .",
    "note that , @xmath94 can be restricted and the minimum value of br(@xmath100 ) can be obtained by using the experimental result of the edm of electron @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that the experimental result of the edm of electron is not more reliable than the one of the process @xmath95 .",

    "the maximum and minimum values are predicted by taking upper and lower limits of @xmath89 lepton edm into account . the maximum ( minimum ) value of the br is @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) for small values of @xmath105 and its sensivity to this parameter is weak",

    "note that we take the coupling @xmath121 real in our calculations .",
    "finally , we study the @xmath17 decay by taking @xmath85 lepton as an internal one similar to previous analysis . here the experimental upper limit for br(@xmath17 ) can be reached for the small values of @xmath121 .",
    "further , the theoretical calculations are consistent with this upper limit for the case where the mass differences of neutral higgs bosons @xmath18 and @xmath19 are large , even for large values of the coupling @xmath127 .    as a summary , we study the @xmath8 s of the decays @xmath15 , @xmath80 and @xmath17 and observe that it is possible to reach the present experimental upper limits in the model iii , playing with the model parameters in the restriction region .",
    "this result is important since the theoretical work in the sm shows that the branching rates are less than @xmath128 and compared to this number large rates are expected with massive and mixing neutrinos . in our analysis , we predict that the @xmath8 for the @xmath15 decay can reach to the values at the order of the magnitude @xmath124 .",

    "the process @xmath17 can have larger @xmath8 compared to the previous ones , since the yukawa couplings entering in the expressions are @xmath131 and @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 s of the processes under consideration are sensitive to the cp - violating parameters since the source of the parts which depend on couplings @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the non - vanishing complex yukawa couplings , in the model iii .    in future , with the reliable experimental result of upper limits of the @xmath8 s of above processes it would be possible to test models beyond the sm and free parameters of these models",
