    "ultrashort optical pulses generate the coherent oscillation of the lattice , which modulates the macroscopic electric susceptibility .",
    "these lattice oscillations are referred to as coherent phonons and can be detected with another ultrashort pulse via intensity modulations in reflectivity or transmissivity  @xcite . using coherent phonons and a pump - probe type optical measurement",
    ", we can directly observe the oscillation of the phonons and measure their dynamics for a wide variety of materials such as semimetals @xcite , semiconductors @xcite , superconductors @xcite and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "in addition , the coherent phonons in carbon materials , e.g. , graphite @xcite , graphene @xcite , and carbon nanotubes @xcite , have attracted much attention in studies of electron - phonon coupling .    to excite and measure the coherent phonons , the pulse duration of the pump and probe pulse needs to be shorter than the vibrational period of the phonons .",
    "this requirement corresponds to a spectral width of the optical pulse that is much bigger than the phonon energy .",
    "the coherent phonon dynamics can be observed as a change in transient reflectivity .",
    "while this change depends on the probe light frequency , the reflected light can be measured without needing spectrally resolved methods .",
    "this is commonly used and is referred to here as the spectrally integrated detection .",
    "in contrast , the spectrally resolved detection shows that the associated change in transient reflectivity at shorter and longer wavelengths oscillates @xmath1 out of phase  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the sensitivity of the spectrally resolved detection is much higher than that of the spectrally integrated detection because the shorter- and longer- wavelength components cancel each out .    in this paper , we investigate enhancement of the detection sensitivity for the coherent optical phonons using the spectrally resolved detection and found a strong enhancement of approximately @xmath0 times in diamond .",
    "diamond has a wide band gap ( a direct gap of @xmath2  ev and an indirect gap of @xmath3  ev ) and a high optical - phonon frequency ( @xmath4 thz ) .",
    "raman spectroscopy has been widely used to extract properties of diamond because the phonon spectrum is sensitively dependent on the crystal structure of carbon materials such as diamond , graphite , graphene , and carbon nanotubes . recently , as an application of quantum memory , the dynamics of longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons in diamond has been studied  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the coherent - phonon measurement using ultrashort visible pulses ( photon energy of @xmath5  ev ) and spectrally integrated detection have recorded @xmath4-thz coherent optical phonons in diamond and evaluated these lifetimes based on the difference in impurity rates  @xcite . in the present experiment ,",
    "we used an ultrashort infrared pulse with a central wavelength of @xmath6  ev and neglected linear and multiphoton absorption effects .",
    "the coherent optical phonons are investigated using a pump - probe - type transient reflection measurement ( fig .  [ expfig ] ) . the output pulse from the ti : sapphire oscillator ( femtolasers : rainbow ) , the spectrum of which was is given in fig .",
    "[ spectrumexp ] measured using a usb spectrometer ( oceanoptics : usb2000 + ) , was divided into two pulses by a @xmath7 beam splitter , and used as pump and probe pulses .",
    "the pump pulse went through a scan delay unit ( ape : scan delay 50 ) to control the time delay between the pump and probe pulses .",
    "the scan delay was run with a sine function of @xmath8 hz .",
    "also , the probe pulse was picked up by a @xmath9 beam splitter to measure the reference beam intensity at a photodiode ( pd1 ) .",
    "thereafter , both pump and probe pulses were focused on the sample by using an off - axis parabolic mirror with a focal length of @xmath10  mm .",
    "the reflected pulse from the sample was detected with a photodiode ( pd2 ) .",
    "in addition , optical bandpass filters are put before pd2 for the spectrally resolved detection , which were fb740 , fb800 , fb850 , and fb900 ( thorlabs inc . ) with transmission at a central wavelength of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14  nm , respectively , with a band width of @xmath15  nm . by applying the opposite bias voltages to pd1 and pd2 , we set the balanced detection before the experiment .",
    "its differential signal , to be amplified with a low - noise current amplifier ( stanford research systems : sr570 ) , was measured by a digital oscilloscope ( iwatsu : ds5534 ) . to reduce the statistical error ,",
    "the @xmath16 signals were averaged and taken as the measured value . by converting the temporal motion of the scan delay unit to the pump - probe pulse duration , the temporal evolution of the reflectivity change @xmath17 was obtained .",
    "the time interval of the sampling data points was estimated to be @xmath18  fs .",
    "note that the spectral chirping by the optics was compensated using a pair of chirp mirrors in order to minimize the pulse width at the sample position .",

    "we next analyze the coherent lo phonon dynamics by measuring the change in transient reflectivity .",
    "figure [ typ ] shows the transient - reflectivity dynamics of the diamond obtained for a whole spectral range without any filters . with overlapping the pump and probe pulses there is a strong peak at zero delay because of diamond s nonlinear response . after the strong peaks",
    "there is a modulation caused by the coherent optical phonons in diamond .",
    "the transient reflectivity expanded over the interval from @xmath27 to @xmath12  fs clearly indicates that the vibrational period is @xmath28  fs ( frequency of @xmath29 thz ) .",

    "this phase change in the transient transmission spectrum of carbon nanotubes was already reported  @xcite .",
    "the phase of the coherent phonon oscillation in the differential transmission for the radial breathing mode of single - walled carbon nanotubes depends on the detection wavelength .",
    "the oscillations at wavelengths of @xmath38  nm and @xmath39  nm are anti - phase to each other , and hence below and above the resonance of the @xmath40 band gap . in contrast , in the present study , we observed a phase difference in the transient reflectivity although all the probe wavelengths are below the band gap .    to elaborate a mechanism for our observed anti - phase effect , when a delay @xmath41 between the pump and probe pulses is much longer than the optical pulse width @xmath42 , the generation and the detection processes",
    "are treated as independent . to clarify our observation in the spectrally resolved measurement ,",
    "the detection process of the coherent phonons is only discussed .",
    "the incidence of the pump pulse on the diamond at time @xmath43 induces coherent optical phonons via impulsive stimulated raman scattering  @xcite because the optical energy ( @xmath6  ev ) is well below the band gap ( @xmath2  ev ) @xcite of the diamond .",

    "then , eq . ( [ final1 ] ) implies that the largest signals should be measured at @xmath63 thz and @xmath64 thz , corresponding to @xmath65 nm and @xmath66 nm , respectively , which is consistent with the present data .",
    "it is worth noting that eq .",
    "( [ final1 ] ) is a universal formula for the spectrally resolved detection of coherent phonons in the transparent region .",
    "note that the prerequisite for the @xmath1 out - of - phase effect is that the electric susceptibility @xmath60 is a real quantity in the transparent region . in the opaque region ,",
    "the relative phase of the oscillation depends on the relative magnitude of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite gives a theoretical treatment of the pump - probe signal in the transmission process for optically thin systems .",
    "essentially , the same formula can be applied to the reflection process by regarding @xmath67 as the electric field of the reflected probe pulse without the pump .    in",
    "the commonly used transient - reflectivity measurements without filters , the oscillations at higher and lower frequencies cancel out because they oscillate @xmath1 out of phase . while one may think that no coherent phonon oscillation is observed without any filters , the oscillation amplitude is proportional to the difference between the electric susceptibilities , @xmath68 , and the electric susceptibility",

    "( [ final1 ] ) . in our case",
    ", the lower frequency components can be observed in the detection without a filter . the oscillation amplitude in @xmath69 with the specific filter is bigger than that in @xmath37 without a filter .",
    "our experimental data show that the sensitivity of the fb900 band - pass filter is @xmath0 times higher than that without any filter .",
    "we remark that the observed oscillations with fb900 and fb850 are not perfectly @xmath1 out of phase .",
    "this may be caused by the spectral chirping in the optical pulse because the fourier - transform - limited pulse was assumed for simplicity in our theoretical treatment .",
    "we observed the changes in the transient reflectivity via coherent optical phonons in diamond using ultrashort infrared pulses and showed that the spectrally resolved detection can enhance the sensitivity of the coherent phonon measurement approximately @xmath0 times compared with the commonly used spectrally integrated measurement .",
    "this is because the reflected - light intensities for higher and lower frequencies from the spectral centroid oscillate @xmath1 out of phase and canceled each other out .    with our enhanced method",
    ", we can measure the transient vibrational - state dynamics in a diamond more precisely , for example , the coherence time of the coherent phonon . as alluded to before  @xcite ,",

    "it can be shown that the spectrally integrated signal , which is obtained in the common pump - probe experiment for the coherent phonons , is given by the integration of the spectrally resolved signal as @xmath92 the actually observed change in the reflection is normalized by the reflection amplitude @xmath93 without the pump pulse . as @xmath94 , we find @xmath95    for non - resonant excitation by the pump pulse , the coherent oscillation of the optical phonons is driven by the impulsive momentum generated by the virtual transition to the excited electronic states .",

    "<S> coherent optical phonons in bulk solid system play a crucial role in understanding and designing light - matter interactions and can be detected by the transient - reflectivity measurement . in this paper , we demonstrate spectrally resolved detection of coherent optical phonons in diamond from ultrashort infrared pump - probe measurements using optical band - pass filters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this enhances the sensitivity approximately @xmath0 times in measuring the coherent oscillations in the transient reflectivity compared with the commonly used spectrally integrated measurement . </S>",
    "<S> to explain this observation , we discuss its mechanism . </S>"
