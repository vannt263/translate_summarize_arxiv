    "homeostasis @xcite is the ability of living organisms to adapt to external and dynamical stimuli . at the cellular level",
    ", homeostasis can be physiologically achieved through _ _ perfect adaptation__@xcite , a mechanism ensuring properties in living cells analogous to robustness and disturbance rejection in control systems .",
    "several homeostatic motifs achieving perfect or near - perfect adaptation have been discovered and proposed over the past years .",
    "important examples are the _ incoherent feedforward motif _ and the _ negative feedback loop motif _ ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is notably shown in @xcite that bacterial chemotaxis involves integral feedback and , as pointed out in @xcite , that this integral feedback is implemented as a negative feedback loop motif with a buffering node .",
    "more recently , two novel integral control motifs have been proposed : the _ antithetic integral control motif _ @xcite and an _ autocatalytic integral control motif _ @xcite .",
    "the antithetic integral motif benefits from several interesting properties : it can achieve tracking and perfect adaptation for the controlled network , its metabolic load can be made arbitrarily close to the constitutive bound via a suitable choice for its parameters , and it can be used in both deterministic and stochastic settings .",
    "it is also the first homeostatic motif that is proved to work in the stochastic setting , implying then that it can perfectly achieve its function in the low copy number regime .",
    "an unexpected and intriguing property , which is exclusive to the stochastic setting , is that of _ controller innocuousness _ : the antithetic integral control motif can not make the closed - loop network non - ergodic ( i.e. make the closed - loop network trajectories to grow without bound ) .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the common understanding that setting a too high gain for the integral action will likely result in a destabilization of the closed - loop system ( unless quite restrictive conditions are met by the open - loop system ) . as this feature is only present in the stochastic setting",
    ", we can conclude that this property emerges from the presence of noise in the dynamics and , therefore , that the antithetic integral control exploits this noise for achieving its function .",
    "several other networks , such as the bistable switch of @xcite and the circadian clock model of @xcite , have been reported to heavily rely upon noise to realize their function  their deterministic counterparts indeed fail in achieving any similar function    sufficient conditions for the open - loop network that characterize whether the antithetic integral controller would ensure the desired tracking and adaptation properties for the closed - loop network have been stated in @xcite for the case of unimolecular reaction networks and a particular class of bimolecular reaction networks . in the unimolecular case ,",
    "these conditions are 1 ) the _ irreducibility _ of the state - space of the closed - loop network , 2 ) the _ output - controllability _ of the open - loop network , and 3 ) the _ hurwitz stability of the characteristic matrix _ of the open - loop network .",
    "these conditions lie in the same spirit as the conditions obtained in @xcite for establishing the long - term behavior of stochastic reaction networks where computationally cheap and versatile conditions were reported .",
    "the irreducibility of the state - space is tacitly assumed to hold in @xcite but can be efficiently checked using the method described in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the irreducibility of the state - space of the closed - loop network , the hurwitz stability of the characteristic matrix , and the output controllability of the open - loop network can all be cast as a mixture of linear programs and linear algebraic conditions .",
    "the complexity of these conditions depends linearly on the number of distinct of species involved in the open - loop network , which makes the approach highly scalable and suitable for considering biological networks consisting of a large number of distinct molecular species .",
    "the conditions in @xcite are formulated for networks with fixed rate parameters , which is equivalent to having a fixed characteristic matrix in the unimolecular case .",
    "the objective of the current paper is to extend these results to families of characteristic matrices that arise from uncertainties at the level of the rate parameters while , at the same time , preserving the scalability of the approach .",
    "we show here that this can be achieved in , at least , two different ways .",
    "the first is quantitative and assumes that the characteristic matrix is an _ interval - matrix _ , i.e. the entries of the characteristic matrix lie within some known and fixed intervals .",
    "we prove several results in this regard , the most important one assessing that all the matrices in the interval are hurwitz stable if and only if the upper - bound is so , and that all the matrices in the interval are output - controllable if and only if the lower - bound is so .",
    "this readily translates to a linear program having the exact same complexity has the one stated in @xcite dealing with the ergodicity and output - controllability of a network with fixed rates .",
    "the second approach is qualitative and assumes that only the sign pattern of the characteristic matrix is known . in this case , we are interested in assessing properties for all the matrices sharing the same sign pattern  an approach often referred to as _",
    "qualitative analysis_. several results obtained in @xcite are revisited and extended to the current problem . the main result states that , given a known sign pattern , all the characteristic matrices sharing this sign pattern are hurwitz stable and output - controllable if and only if the digraph associated with the sign pattern is acyclic and has a path connecting the input node to the output node . as in the nominal and the robust cases ,",
    "these conditions can be recast as computationally inexpensive linear programs that can be applied to large scale networks . *",
    "* we recall in section [ sec : prel ] several definitions and results related to reaction networks and antithetic integral control .",
    "section [ sec : rob ] is concerned with the extension of the results in @xcite to characteristic interval - matrices whereas section [ sec : struct ] addresses the structural case where only the sign pattern of the characteristic matrix is known .",
    "an illustrative example is finally considered in section [ sec : ex ] .    * notations . *",
    "the set of positive ( nonnegative ) vectors is defined as @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the natural basis of @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 , the set of nonnegative integers , natural numbers and integers are denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we consider here a reaction network with @xmath7 molecular species @xmath8 that interacts through @xmath9 reaction channels @xmath10 formulated as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the rate and @xmath13 .",
    "each reaction is described by a stoichiometric vector and a propensity function .",
    "the stoichiometric vector of reaction @xmath14 is denoted by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "hence , when the reaction @xmath14 fires , the state jumps from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "we define the stoichiometry matrix @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",

    "we denote this reaction network by @xmath26 .",
    "antithetic integral control has been introduced in @xcite for solving the perfect adaptation problem in stochastic reaction networks .",
    "the key idea is to adjoin to the open - loop network @xmath26 a set of additional species and reactions ( the controller ) in such a way that , by acting on the production rate of the first molecular species @xmath27 , referred to as the _ actuated species _ , we can steer the mean value of the _ controlled species _",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 , to a desired set - point ( the reference ) .",
    "the controller is also required to be able to reject constant disturbances and to accommodate with possible sporadic changes in the rate parameters ( perfect adaptation ) . as proved in @xcite , the antithetic integral control motif @xmath30 defined with @xmath31 solves this control problem with the set - point being equal to @xmath32 . above",
    ", @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the _ controller species _ , namely , the _ actuating species _ and the _ sensing species _ , respectively .",
    "the four controller parameters @xmath35 are assumed to be freely assignable to any desired value .",
    "the first reaction is the _ reference reaction _ as it encodes part of the reference value @xmath32 as its own rate .",
    "the second one is the _ measurement reaction _ that produces the sensing species @xmath34 at a rate proportional to the current population of the controlled species @xmath28 .",
    "the third reaction is the _ comparison reaction _ as it compares the populations of the controller species and annihilates one molecule of each when these populations are both positive .",
    "note also that this reaction is the one that closes the overall ( negative ) control loop . finally , the fourth reaction is the _ actuation reaction _ that produces the actuated species @xmath27 at a rate proportional to the actuating species @xmath33 .      in the unimolecular reaction networks case ,",
    "the propensity functions are nonnegative affine functions of the current state of the network .",
    "hence , we can write @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the positive vector of reaction rates , as defined in section [ sec : rn ] . before pursuing any further , it is convenient to introduce some terminologies and results .    the _ characteristic matrix _ @xmath40 and the _ offset vector _",
    "@xmath41 of a unimolecular reaction network @xmath26 are defined as @xmath42",

    "scalable linear programming conditions can also be obtained using similar ideas .",
    "the example section demonstrates that the method is also applicable on networks with non mass - action kinetics .",
    "however , its extension to bimolecular networks is more difficult but might be possible by merging the results obtained in @xcite together . in this case , however , the problem will likely become np - hard ( of complexity @xmath228 ) , but will remain applicable to networks of reasonable size .",
    "finally , methods capturing more explicitly the exact parametric dependency , such as those in @xcite , can also be considered but will necessarily lead to more complex computational problems .",
    "their development is left for future research .",
