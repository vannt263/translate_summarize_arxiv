    "v651 mon is the binary central star of the bipolar planetary nebula ngc 2346 .",
    "the 15.991-d binary consists of an a5 v star , which emits most of the visual light , and a hot ( @xmath2 @xmath010@xmath3 k ) subdwarf , which emits the most of the ultraviolet light @xcite .",
    "this binary has received special attention since its fading episode starting in 1981 @xcite .",
    "the fading initially showed a strong modulation with the orbital period .",
    "subsequent observations led to a picture of a passing cloud ( within the planetary nebula ) in front of the binary : eclipse - like fadings in the visual light occur when the orbiting a5 v star passes behind the cloud ( for a review on this object , see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite expect , from the amount of dust from iras observations , that the probability of such passages is very small .",
    "in fact , plate searches could not detect any similar events between 1899 and 1981 @xcite .",
    "further detailed photoelectric observations only caught small variations @xcite , or a transient short fading @xcite .    in spite of a prediction by @xcite ,",
    "the second - ever deep fading was reported in 1996 september @xcite .",
    "we started ccd observations upon this alert .",
    "the observations were made on 38 nights between 1996 november 14 and 1998 january 2 , using a ccd camera ( thomson th  7882 , 576 @xmath4 384 pixels , on - chip 2 @xmath4 2 binning adopted ) attached to the cassegrain focus of the 60 cm reflector ( focal length=4.8 m ) at ouda station , kyoto university @xcite .",
    "an interference filter was used , which had been designed to reproduce the johnson _",
    "the exposure time was 2060 s , depending on the brightness of the object .",
    "the frames were first corrected for standard de - biasing and flat fielding , and were then processed by a microcomputer - based photometry package developed by one of the authors ( tk ) .",
    "we employed a psf profile fitting procedure for the central star in order to minimize any contamination from the planetary nebula .",
    "the magnitudes were determined relative to gsc 4815.3644 ( @xmath5=11.76 , vsnet chart ) , whose constancy during the run was confirmed using gsc 4815.3177 .",

    "the ccd observation started when the 19961997 fading episode reached close to its minimum .",
    "the object recovered to its normal magnitude during the latest two observations ( at the end of 1997 ) .        following the interpretation by @xcite , the cloud responsible for the fade was either smaller or had a larger tangential velocity .",
    "the total depth of the fading ( @xmath02.7 mag ) may be slightly smaller than the extreme value reported in the 19811985 event .",
    "this difference , however , may be a result of a systematic difference of the measurements : in the 19811985 event , the aperture background subtraction technique in photoelectric photometry was employed in order to measure the faint object against the bright nebular background , while the present observations of the 19961997 event used psf fitting of the stellar profile on two - dimensional ccd images . by taking this effect into account ,",
    "the depth was found to be roughly comparable to that of the 19811985 event , implying that the opacity of the cloud is similar .",
    "another notable feature of the present event is the presence of a sharply defined transient brightening around jd 2450540 .",
    "the enlarged light curve around this brightening is shown in figure [ fig : brightening ] .",
    "although visual observations reported to vsnet suggest the presence of a weak 16-d periodicity , as was observed in the 19811985 event , no other brightening with a similar amplitude was observed around the binary phase of the brightening . since the binary motion of the central close binary",
    "is expected to be much faster than the tangential velocity of the orbiting cloud [ @xcite proposed 0.14 km s@xmath12 for the 19811985 event ] , the sharply defined brightening is considered to more reflect the orbital motion of the a5 v star against the foreground cloud . by assuming @xmath13=16.4 km s@xmath12 @xcite",
    ", the sharp structure of the light curve corresponds to an upper limit of the projected scale of several times @xmath010@xmath1 cm .",
    "this scale is by a factor of about ten smaller than the entire cloud responsible for the 19811985 fade , which was estimated to have a size of 25 @xmath4 10@xmath14 cm @xcite .",
    "this observation not only provides the first evidence for such a sharply defined , small lucent structure within the obscuring body around the central star of ngc 2346 , but also the first - ever direct determination of the dimension of a fine structure within a dust cloud of a planetary nebula .",
