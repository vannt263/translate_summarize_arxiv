    "it is evident that the hxr pulse in the 12 - 25 kev energy band is associated with the flare in the southern hemisphere ( s2 ) with position ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) in heliographic coordinates with @xmath16-axis along the line of sight pointing toward the earth and @xmath17-axis to the north .",
    "the x - ray fluxes of s2 peak earlier at higher energies similar to other impulsive flares , and the x - ray fluxes do not change significantly from 18:48 to 18:51 .",
    "the other source ( s1 : the default source identified by the rhessi software ) is located in the northern hemisphere with coordinate ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and has more gradual time evolution and better correlated fluxes among different x - ray bands .",
    "these two flares appear to start within a few seconds of one another . for a spatial separation of @xmath20 cm on the solar surface , they are not likely causally connected .",
    "sympathetic flares have been studied extensively before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these two flares are both goes b class small flares with no apparent agent linking the two flaring active regions .",
    "the fact that they occurred almost simultaneously with comparable x - ray fluxes at the peak appears to be a coincidence .",
    "given the small magnitude of these flares ,",
    "they are also transient brightenings in active regions , which frequently occur simultaneously without obvious physical connections @xcite .    h@xmath0 images of the sun are routinely taken at the bbso with a cadence of 1 minutes .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig3 ] shows the h@xmath0 light curves of these two flares .",
    "it is interesting to note that the h@xmath0 fluxes of both flares peak at the same time of @xmath3 18:51:30 as the goes 1 - 8   flux .",
    "the h@xmath0 flux of s2 increases dramatically from 18:47:31 to 18:48:31 , which appears to be correlated with the hxr pulse .",
    "both the x - ray and h@xmath0 light curves of s1 rise more gradually than those of s2 .",
    "the sharp rise of the goes em during the hxr pulse as shown in figure [ fig1 ] therefore is likely caused by s2 .",
    "as with the rhessi observations , the h@xmath0 fluxes of these two flares have similar amplitudes .",
    "although the box designed to extract flux from s1 is larger than that for s2 , its h@xmath0 flux is lower than that of s2 due to the limb darkening effect .",
    "however , the amplitude of the h@xmath0 flux increases during these flares are comparable .    s1 has complex structures in both h@xmath0 and x - ray images and its fluxes in different wavelengths show well correlated gradual evolution as seen in gradual flares .",

    "as the flare evolves , it becomes more and more compact and the contraction is always along the loop .    these complex source structures , in combination with the fact that the other flare s1 with a similar magnitude occurs simultaneously with the flare loop , show clearly that the interpretation of the spectral fit results can be highly ambiguous . although both an isothermal and a single power law model give reasonable fits to the spatially integrated spectra , the fact that these two flares are independent and have complex energy - dependent structures strongly rejects literal interpretation of the spectral fit results .",

    "injection of a power - law electron population into a simple loop will also produce well defined energy dependent source structure @xcite .",

    "however in comparison with the single power - law model , the isothermal model is favored due to the very high values of the spectral index of the power law model .",

    "the total thermal energy content of the emitting plasma at the peak time of the goes em is on the order of @xmath10 ergs consistent with transient brightenings in active regions and the total radiative energy of the flare as inferred from goes observations .",
    "the density of electrons producing the rhessi source is a factor of a few lower than that inferred from goes observations due to the lower values of the em inferred from rhessi spectral fits , which may suggest a lower filling factor of the hxr emitting plasma . since a high density is needed to confine tens of kev electrons in the corona part of the loop during the rise phase , the increase of the em in the rise phase is likely caused by an increase of the volume filling factor of the emitting plasmas instead of an increase of the density due to evaporation from the chromosphere footpoints , which is also consistent with the multi - strand interpretation of the flare loop inferred above .",

    "the overlaying contours show the 3 - 25 kev rhessi image from 18:48:01 to 18:49:01 , which is centered at the time of the latter h@xmath0 image .",
    "while the north rim of the rhessi arc appears to be well aligned with the north rim of the enhanced h@xmath0 emission , no enhanced h@xmath0 emission is seen along the south rim of the x - ray source . since brighter h@xmath0 features have lower average formation height , the enhanced h@xmath0 emission is likely caused by reduction of h@xmath0 opacity in the chromosphere by the flaring loop instead of emergence of new relatively cool h@xmath0 emitting materials within the hot flare loop .",
    "one therefore may associate the absence of enhanced h@xmath0 emission along the south rim of the x - ray loop with absorption features in the chromosphere with a linear size of about @xmath28 cm .",
    "although the h@xmath0 source extends further westward than the x - ray arc , all these emissions can be readily associated with a flare loop and there is no evident footpoint emission as seen in typical large two - ribbon flares .    .",

    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig3 ] ) , there is no evidence of enhanced h@xmath0 .",
    "enhanced h@xmath0 emission is first detected one minute later after the hxr pulse .",
    "it is unfortunate that there are no h@xmath0 observations during the hxr pulse . both emission and absorption features evolve during the flare . in general , the brightest region moves south and absorption features to the south become thinner and thinner as the flare progresses .",
    "a dark absorption cloud forms to the north after 18:54:31 .",
    "this absorbing material evolves significantly during the flare and may participate into the flare process .",
    "the small size and rapid evolution of the absorbing material implies that it can not be very high in the corona .",
    "the altitude of the flare loop should be even lower so that the h@xmath0 images of the flare loop can be affected by these materials .",
    "otherwise a flare loop high in the corona needs to affect the low - lying h@xmath0 absorption materials in a complicated manner to account for the correlated x - ray and h@xmath0 images .",
    "the good correlation between h@xmath0 and 195   images discussed above also supports the view that the h@xmath0 brightening during the flare is caused by heating of absorbing materials , which reduces the h@xmath0 opacity .",
    "the flare loop therefore must lie very low in the solar corona or even in the chromosphere .",
    "it is interesting to note that the bright spot in the difference map of euv emission in the right panel of figure [ fig6 ] ( indicated by the plus sign in the figure ) is located at the dark region between the two bright h@xmath0 spots in the middle , which may suggest interaction of the h@xmath0 absorbing material with the euv loop .",
    "the appearance of the h@xmath0 images is strongly affected by absorption .",
    "detailed spectroscopic observations of similar loops at h@xmath0 will be able to determine the relative altitude of the loop and the absorption materials and the nature of the h@xmath0 brightening .",
    "observations , images are made for every one minute interval centered on the times when the h@xmath0 images are taken . the front segment of all detectors except for detector 2 are used and the energy band is 3 - 25 kev .",
    "the box is the same as that in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the evolution of the source structure , the color scale is chosen independently to optimize the appearance of each frame .",
    ", width=566 ]    figure [ fig9 ] shows the evolution of the x - ray loop with a cadence of 1 minute to compare with the h@xmath0 images in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "although both the x - ray and h@xmath0 emission evidently come from the same flare region , fine structures of the x - ray are not well correlated with those of h@xmath0 in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the arc structure in the x - ray can be seen only during the first three minutes .",
    "the x - ray source becomes irregular afterward , which is in contrast to the h@xmath0 observations , where the source structure appears to evolve continuously .",
    "since x - ray emission is associated with the hottest plasmas and h@xmath0 emission comes from relatively cold materials and is affected by absorption , differences between x - ray and h@xmath0 images are expected , which is quite different from impulsive hard x - ray and h@xmath0 emission caused by energetic electrons injected into chromospheric footpoints of classical flare loops .",
    "the appearance of three x - ray sources in the first time interval 18:47:01 - 18:48:01 is reminiscent of the classical flare model with one coronal source and two chromospheric footpoints .",
    "however , the x - ray source evolution , observations in other wavelengths , and the fact that all these sources are dominated by low energy photons suggest that they are all thermal sources along the coronal loop , which agrees with the energy dependent source structure shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "in this paper we carried out a detailed analysis of multi - wavelength observations of a flare loop with distinct impulsive and gradual emission components .",
    "it is shown that all of the observed h@xmath0 and x - ray emissions are associated with the coronal part of the loop with no evidence of emission from the footpoints and the impulsive component might be associated with superhot plasmas produced in turbulent - current sheets located in the loop @xcite , in contrast to the conventional view where the impulsive component is associated with nonthermal particles in the chromosphere . although both an isothermal model and a power - law model give a comparable fit to the spatially integrated x - ray spectra in the impulsive phase , the lack of footpoint emission , the softness of the spectra with the power law model , and the complex x - ray and h@xmath0 structure along the loop all favor a quasi - thermal interpretation of the impulsive component .",
    "the flare loop studied here has very simple light curves , a very stable large scale structure , and appears to have a very low altitude with both emission and absorption features shown in the h@xmath0 images .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is correlated with the x - ray structure and aligned with the loop .",
    "the impulsive component is seen in both the hxr and h@xmath0 light curves .",
    "detailed analysis of the evolution of the h@xmath0 images suggests that the h@xmath0 emission may be dictated by evolution of the absorption materials instead of emergence of new h@xmath0 emitting plasmas within the loop .",
    "although the flare loop is not well covered by euv observations , the absence of detectable 195   emission at the hxr peak time is puzzling for the high temperature ( @xmath27 mk ) inferred from rhessi spectral fit .",
    "it could be caused by the delayed appearance of euv emitting plasma in a flare loop @xcite .",
    "better observations of similar flare loops , especially spectroscopic observations in h@xmath0 , and detailed magnetohydrodynamic simulations of internal kink instability @xcite may be helpful to advance our understanding of this flare loop .",
    "although rhessi spectral analysis of the spatially integrated fluxes is consistent with an isothermal component , x - ray and h@xmath0 images also reveal that two flares with comparable x - ray and h@xmath0 fluxes occurred simultaneously from two distinct active regions several light - seconds apart .",
    "these results show that the rhessi spectral analysis alone can not distinguish different emission components as revealed by the images and it is essential to combine spectroscopy with imaging and multi - wavelength observations to constrain the nature of the underlying physical processes .",
    "we were able to distinguish these two flares with x - ray and h@xmath0 images and the corresponding light curves .",
    "while the flare loop behaves like an early impulsive flare triggered by an instantaneous burst with higher energy emission peaking at an earlier time @xcite , the other flare has relatively complex structure and behaves like a gradual flare with gradually evolving fluxes in different wavelengths well correlated .",
    "the presence of a second flare limits our interpretation of the spatially integrated results , but we can still identify the impulsive component in h@xmath0 , soft x - ray , and hard x - ray light curves and reach the conclusions discussed above .    the flare loop studied here",
    "has a length exceeding @xmath29 cm .",
    "the flare magnitude however is very small with a goes b class .",
    "it however shows several distinct characteristics : impulsive thermal emission , co - spatial h@xmath0 and x - ray emission , lack of euv emission at the hxr peak , relatively long and stable structure .",
    "the coincidence of this flare loop with another flare of comparable magnitude might be accidental , but nevertheless is also rare .",
    "the energetics of these flares is consistent with transient brightenings in active regions discovered by yohkoh @xcite .",
    "such flare loops may occur frequently in contrast to what might be suggested by the unique characteristics present in this paper .",
    "systematic study of similar flare loops is therefore warranted .",
    "this study demonstrates clearly that solar flares are complex phenomena with each flare likely having some unique characteristics .",
    "detailed study of flares with good observational coverage therefore is always warranted and might reveal features challenging the conventional wisdom , such as the impulsive thermal emission revealed here . therefore while seeking common physical processes operating in solar flares , we should also pay due attention to the complexity of flares introduced by the complex magnetic environment of the solar active region , where all micro- and bigger flares originate @xcite .",
