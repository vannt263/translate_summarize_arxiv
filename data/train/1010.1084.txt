    "for the variation from ( o ) to ( a ) , ( the first case ) , the singlet state is suppressed and the triplet state is expected . for the variation of @xmath85 from ( o ) to ( d ) ( the second case ) , the singlet state moves to the triplet state close to @xmath112 . for the variation of @xmath85 from ( o ) to ( g ) ( the third case ) , the singlet state remains as the dominant state but moves to another singlet state ( as explained later ) after @xmath94 takes a minimum close to ( g ) .",

    "when @xmath48 is increased by @xmath85 , the singlet state is suppressed but the triplet state is enhanced ( fig .",

    "when the point moves from ( a ) to ( d ) ( i.e. , increasing @xmath16 ) , the peak position of @xmath92 begins to deviate slightly from @xmath115 and the attractive interaction increases due to the increase of the amount of @xmath92 integrated with respect to the momentum .",

    "the effect of @xmath48 on the singlet pairing state becomes compatible with that of @xmath47 for @xmath116 .",
    "further since @xmath92 is larger than @xmath91 , the spin singlet state is determined mainly by @xmath48 and is assisted by @xmath47 .",
    "the change of the self - energy along @xmath117 axis is very small .",
    "this comes from the difference in the peak position of charge fluctuations i.e. , @xmath115 for ( a ) and that on the @xmath117 axis for ( e ) and ( g ) .    .",
    "]    finally , we examine the node of the gap , which is calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bcsh ] ) and ( [ eq : diago2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : nodes ] denotes the position of nodes and fermi surfaces for points ( o ) , ( f ) , ( g ) and ( d ) . for the singlet state ( o ) , which is mediated by @xmath47 the node exists between two different fermi surfaces implying a full gap due to the existence of the two bands.@xcite for ( f ) and ( g ) ,",
    "the singlet state mediated by @xmath48 has two nodes at @xmath118 , which cross the fermi surfaces .",
    "gap function for triplet has a node on the line @xmath119 suggesting a full - gap state .",
    "we have found the possible singlet sc state with the line nodes in the extended multi - site hubbard model representing @xmath0 with the multi - band and under the anion ordering .",
    "such a state is induced by the charge fluctuation owing to the interchain coulomb interaction @xmath16 ( along the @xmath17-axis ) , while the singlet sc state with anisotropic ( but finite ) gap suggested by shimahara@xcite is reproduced in the presence of the strong spin fluctuation .",
    "moreover , we have investigated the roles of the charge fluctuation for the triplet sc state .",
    "it is found that the triplet state appears in a certain range of the interchain coulomb interactions , @xmath16 and @xmath18 , it is noted that the charge fluctuation cooperates with the spin fluctuation for the triplet pairing , but competes for the singlet pairing .",
    "for such a triplet state , the p - wave like state is obtained in the present multi - site model , while the f - wave gap function have been suggested in the single site models .",
    "@xcite    finally we discuss how to distinguish the sc state with the lines and that with full gap of anisotropy on the fermi surface . using a maximum , @xmath120 , and a minimum , @xmath121 , for the latter case",
    ", @xmath122 reveals the exponential behavior at low temperature , i.e. , @xmath123 . in the preset case",
    ", it is expected that @xmath122 exhibits exponential decrease at lower temperatures than @xmath124k using the ratio given by both our and shimahara s results . on the other hand , yonezawa et al .",
    "have reported that the @xmath122 exhibits @xmath125 behavior at temperatures lower than @xmath126k@xcite .",
