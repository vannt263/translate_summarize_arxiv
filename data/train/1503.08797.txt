    "massive infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) in the galaxy have been recognized as the birthplace of high - mass ( @xmath1 ) stars , since they are massive , cold , and dense @xcite .",
    "millimeter / sub - millimeter interferometric observations toward irdcs have found 0.1  pc scale fragments or cores that might harbor high - mass stars @xcite .",
    "these cores are often associated with molecular outflows , but lack complex organic molecular line emission that are tracing hot cores .",
    "therefore , they are the most promising specimen for studying the very early phase of high - mass star formation .",
    "one important question concerning these cores in irdcs is how they fragment and evolve , until high - mass stars are born .",
    "@xcite found that in irdcs parsec - scale clumps fragment into 0.1  pc scale cores , and @xcite found that 0.1  pc scale cores further fragment into @xmath2@xmath3  pc scale condensations , all of which are more massive than the corresponding thermal jeans masses but are consistent with turbulent jeans masses .",
    "therefore , in irdcs turbulent pressure is essential in supporting the fragmentation , so that massive cores are able to form and grow .",
    "@xcite studied 0.1  pc scale cores in two high - mass star forming regions , and found that all the cores are gravitationally bound , with their gravitational mass far exceeding the virial mass , therefore turbulence is not sufficient to stop cores from fast collapsing .    to study the impact of turbulence in the initial fragmentation and core growth in irdcs , we select four clumps in an irdc g28.53@xmath00.25 ( g28.53 hereafter ) .",
    "g28.53 has a kinematic distance of 5.4  kpc @xcite and a luminosity of @xmath43500   @xcite .",
    "it has been mapped in 1.2 mm continuum with the iram 30 m single - dish telescope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also see ) , which reveals a total mass of @xmath4@xmath5  .",
    "ten continuum peaks are identified , each of which is a few hundreds of and of @xmath41  pc scales , therefore they are typical clumps that form massive stars .",
    "@xcite also classified these clumps as active , intermediate , or quiescent in terms of star formation based on the infrared emission . among them ,",
    "the most massive ( @xmath4@xmath6  ) one at the center of g28.53 , mm1 , is classified as quiescent .",
    "a less massive but more luminous clump at the southern end of the cloud , mm5 , is classified as intermediate .",
    "two clumps in the southeast corner , mm7 and mm8 , are classified as quiescent .",
    "@xcite obtained 3  mm spectral lines of the ten clumps and confirmed the classification of @xcite based on chemistry .",
    "interferometric observations at angular resolutions of 12 toward mm1 revealed further fragmentation @xcite .",
    "@xcite resolved a 0.1  pc scale core in mm1 into three smaller condensations .",
    "although these condensations do not present detectable spectral line emission at an arcsecond resolution , the single - dish observations of mm1 suggested active star formation given broad line wings and detection of sio emission which is a typical shock tracer .",
    "@xcite mapped mm1 with the submillimeter array ( sma ) in 345  ghz and found a massive ( @xmath460  ) core known as ` core  2 ' , which is different with the one found by @xcite .",
    "no co outflows or hot core tracers were found in this core .",
    "however , given its large amount of gas and its location at the center of the gravitational potential well of g28.53 , it is puzzling that mm1 is more quiescent than mm5 .",
    "previous single - dish observations might miss the deeply embedded cores in mm1 that are actively forming stars .",
    "the two interferometric studies detected a few dust cores but lacked molecular lines to trace the star formation , and the co emission at 345  ghz as an outflow tracer was filtered by the interferometer .",
    "therefore , it is worth revisiting the 0.1  pc scale fragmentation within mm1 , and compare it with the ` intermediate ' mm5 and ` quiescent ' mm7 and mm8 .    in this paper",
    ", we will use high angular resolution line observations to trace kinematics and determine gas temperatures .",
    "itself is also useful in tracing dense gas with a critical density of @xmath4@xmath5   @xcite .",
    "we will also use millimeter continuum and spectral lines to resolve 0.1  pc scale cores in the four clumps and trace star formation .",
    "the combination of kinematics ( e.g.  linewidth , velocity components along the line of sight ) and temperatures from lines and dust emission from millimeter continuum will allow us to determine the properties of cores reliably",

    "we put constraints so that the ratio of optical depths of the main and satellite lines of is 1/0.278 for both satellite lines , all four gaussians have the same velocity dispersion , and the velocity separations between the main and two inner satellite lines are 7.47 and 7.57   @xcite , then we minimized the difference between the spectra and the model , using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm implemented by the lmfit python package .",
    "the rotation temperature and column density were then derived from the best - fitted parameters as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the temperature map is shown in a. the rotation temperature throughout g28.53 is @xmath1617  k. even around the dust core ` core  2 ' and the masers , it is not showing increased temperature .    the spectra within mm1 present two velocity components , at @xmath485   and @xmath487   respectively .",
    "similar multiple components have been detected in the central regions of a few filamentary irdcs @xcite .",
    "for these spectra , the general fitting procedure above derived overall properties which blended the two components and derived a temperature that is usually a few  k different from the true temperature of either component ( cf .",
    "a and ) .",
    "we attempted to fit the two velocity components simultaneously and derive a temperature map for each component .",
    "however , it was unsuccessful thanks to the limited signal - to - noise ratios in the spectra .",
    "thus , we averaged the spectra within the cores in mm1 defined in section  [ subsec : results_fragmentation ] to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , and fitted them with a model containing two components each of which includes four gaussians as in the single velocity component case .",
    "the two central velocities were both fixed during the fitting .",
    "the fitting results are shown in and .",
    "typical temperatures are 1317  k , while the temperature of the 85   component is in general 2  k higher that of the 87   component , suggesting that there are indeed two distinct components .",
    "we obtained column densities of the two velocity components , which were used to determine the ratio of dust masses in the two components in section  [ subsec : results_fragmentation ] .",
    "we also derived the rotation temperature using the vla data only . without gbt data ,",
    "the interferometer filters out extended emission and has more contribution from compact structures . however , the change of the temperature map is insignificant , as shown in b. the highest temperature is @xmath1720  k which is found in mm1 , while typical temperatures are still 1317  k as in a. note that the two velocity components also show up in mm1 in the vla data .",
    "we fitted the average spectra of mm1-p1 with two velocity components and showed the result in .",
    "the temperature of the 87   component is consistent with that derived from the combined data , while the temperature of the 85   component is up to @xmath420  k.    in addition , we detected emission in mm1 with vla .",
    "unlike and ( 2,2 ) , the ( 3,3 ) emission is concentrated .",
    "we marked the three positions exhibiting strong ( 3,3 ) emission in b as t1t3 , as well as ` core  2 ' which presents weak ( @xmath18 ) ( 3,3 ) emission , with their spectra shown in insets .",
    "t1 presents two velocity components , at @xmath485 and @xmath487  .",
    "the other three spectra all center at @xmath487  .",
    "we fitted a single gaussian to the spectra of ` core  2 ' , t2 , and t3 , and two gaussians at 85.5 and 87.9   to the spectrum of t1 .",

    "the fwhm linewidths of the two components of t1 are 2.6 and 1.8   respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that t2 and t3 are next to the maser w4 , whose positions are consistent with the possible co outflow lobes surrounding w4 as discussed in section [ subsec : results_masers ]",
    ". these two emission peaks might suggest outflow heating and turbulence injection given the high excitation temperature of ( 123.5  k ) and the large linewidths we detected .",

    "these @xmath40.1  pc scale peaks are in agreement with the definition of cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "then we fitted 2d gaussian functions to them and obtained their positions and deconvolved sizes .",
    "we also applied the primary beam correction to the images and obtained the corrected fluxes of the cores .",
    "the results are listed in .",
    "we assumed a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 , and thermal equilibrium between dust and gas , then the mass is @xcite : @xmath20 in which @xmath21^{-1}$ ] , and the dust emissivity index @xmath22 for mm1 and mm8 , 1.7 for mm5 , and 1.0 for mm7 @xcite .",
    "we also reported errors of @xmath23 in , assuming that @xmath23 is only dependent on @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the error in the kinematic distance was assumed to be 10% @xcite .",
    "the errors in the fluxes and temperatures listed in the table are from gaussian fittings without accounting for observational uncertainties .",
    "the observational uncertainty of the fluxes are mainly due to flux calibration as described in section [ subsec : smaobs ] , which is typically 20% , while that of the temperatures depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of the lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is typically @xmath20.5  k for our spectral data with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath2720 .",
    "accumulating all the errors listed above , typical errors in @xmath23 are 30% , which should be interpreted as lower limits given the unknown uncertainty in @xmath28 , possible discrepancy in the temperatures of dust and , and the uncertainty in gas - to - dust mass ratio .    for mm1 , using the compact configuration data , we resolved it into six cores at an angular resolution of @xmath42.3 , labelled as mm1-p1 to mm1-p6 in a. we detected line emission at 87   towards mm1-p1 , which is the only core that this line is detected among all cores we identified in the four clumps .",
    "the cores in mm1 all exhibit two velocity components in lines . emission of both components morphologically matches the dust emission .",
    "we considered the component at @xmath487  , because both the line emission we detected and the single - dish and lines @xcite are at @xmath487  .",
    "after deriving masses using the parameters listed in , we determined the ratios of masses in the two components based on the column densities in , and scaled the masses of the cores .    among the six cores in mm1 , mm1-p1 is consistent with ` core  2 ' reported in @xcite while mm1-p2 is consistent with the core reported in @xcite , both using 345  ghz dust continuum emission .",
    "@xcite resolved mm1-p2 into three condensations , at an angular resolution of @xmath42 .",
    "the three condensations have sizes of @xmath40.06  pc and masses of 920  .",

    "lines are tracers of dense gas given their large critical densities ( 10@xmath29  ) , while line could trace outflows . the relationship between these lines and star formation in the cores will be discussed in section [ subsec : disc_mm15 ] .",
    "the sma observations covered the line , which can trace molecular outflows driven by protostars .",
    "we detected co outflows in mm1 and mm5 .",
    "mm7 and mm8 also present co emission , but do not show any signature of outflows .",
    "the co channel maps in reveal two parallel bipolar outflows , associated with mm1-p1 and mm1-p2 .",
    "the co emission associated with mm1-p1 presents two blue shifted components at 81 and 83   with respect to the system velocity of 87  , on opposite sides of mm1-p1 . at more redshifted velocities between 90100  , co emission is also found around mm1-p1 .",
    "it is consistent with a bipolar outflow nearly parallel to the plane of the sky , with the two components at 81 and 83   tracing its near side while the emission at more redshifted velocities tracing its far side ( e.g.  figure  8 of * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the co emission associated with mm1-p2 reveals two components at 9092   and 9294   on two opposite sides of the core , which might trace the red - shifted component of a bipolar outflow in the plane of the sky .",
    "we found a co emission gap at 8588  , indicating the sma filtered out the extended co emission around the systematic velocity .",
    "a maser detected in @xcite ( w1 , section  [ subsec : results_masers ] ) is in the projected path of the co outflow associated with mm1-p2 .",
    "its velocity is 85  , while the co velocity here is 9496   which is 10   apart , therefore it is unlikely excited by the outflow .",
    "we also found compact line emission , which has a critical density of @xmath4@xmath30  @xcite , at the same position of w1 but at the velocity of 89  . it could be a dense core which is not detected by the sma dust observations because of insufficient sensitivity at the edge of the primary beam .",
    "we also found a bipolar outflow in mm5 , shown in the co channel maps in .",
    "the outflow is oriented in a north - south direction , with a blue shifted component at 7983   and a red shifted component at 9096  .",
    "the central velocity , @xmath487  , is consistent with the velocities of the cores .",

    "the 22  ghz vla observations revealed three masers around mm1 , and none in mm5 . including the maser found by @xcite , there are 4 masers around mm1 , labelled as w1w4 in figures  [ fig : temperature ] and [ fig : sma_mms]a , among which w1 and w4 are within mm1",

    "masers have been used as star formation indicators in irdcs @xcite . as discussed above ,",
    "w1 is not likely associated with the outflow driven by mm1-p2 , but is coincident with a dense core revealed by .",
    "it is also associated with an infrared source as shown in .",
    "w2 is to the north of mm1 , far away from the field of the sma observations , so we could not relate it to any dense cores or outflows .",

    "we also found emission as well as a 24   infrared source associated with it in figures  [ fig : iram ] and [ fig : temperature ] .",
    "w3 is also beyond the scope of the sma observations , spatially coincident with mm4 defined by @xcite .",
    "a dust core found by @xcite is likely coincident with it , although the association is uncertain because of a lack of measurement of the core velocity .",
    "w4 is within the sma field , and is coincident with weak dust emission as shown in a. in , there is a strong co emission component to the south of w4 at 90100  , while only weak co emission shows up symmetrically to the north of it at 81  , resulting in a central velocity of @xmath48586   if there was an outflow , which is consistent with the velocity of w4 .",
    "therefore , w1 and w4 might trace two protostars within mm1 that are missed by the sma continuum observations .",

    "note that for mm5 , we used the 1.2  mm flux in @xcite , the dust emissivity index in @xcite , and the mean rotation temperature to calculate the clump mass using , instead of directly quoting the mass in @xcite , because of the possibly incomplete spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting ( see section [ subsubsec : disc_mm5 ] ) .",
    "the resulting clump mass is 4 times larger . for consistency , we calculated masses of the other three clumps in the same way , and their masses are within a factor of 50% with respect to the results of @xcite .",

    "are then consistent with the observed core masses .",
    "therefore , turbulent pressure is dominant over thermal pressure during 1@xmath420.1  pc scales fragmentation , which is consistent with fragmentation studies of other irdcs @xcite .      with the velocity dispersion @xmath15 and the deconvolved radius @xmath43 based on , we analyze virial status of the cores .",
    "the gas is in a virial equilibrium if the kinetic energy equals half of the gravitational energy . if the core mass is larger than its virial mass , it is gravitationally bound and will collapse .",
    "note that in this framework , rotation of cores , magnetic field , or external pressure are all ignored , therefore the virial analysis is only robust in the simplest scenario .",
    "the virial mass depends on density profile of the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming the radial density profile is @xmath44 as measured in irdc cores @xcite , then the virial mass is @xmath45 if instead the density does not depend on the radius , @xmath46 , then @xmath47 will be 1.7 times larger .",

    "all but mm1-p3 , mm7-p1 , and mm8-p2 have @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in the simplest scenario where only gravitational and kinetic energies are considered , all cores are gravitationally bound and tend to collapse if @xmath51 . the cores with significant star formation , mm1-p1/p2 and mm5-p1 ( see section  [ subsec : disc_mm15 ] ) , are strongly self - gravitating ( @xmath52 ) . even in the relative quiescent clumps such as mm7 and mm8 , the cores are still gravitationally bound .",
    "we compared the virial parameters of the cores in g28.53 with those of hot cores in the sample in our recent work by @xcite in .",
    "the three hot core sources are iras  18089@xmath01732 , iras  18360@xmath00537 , and iras  18414@xmath00339 .",
    "note that in @xcite , the core masses are determined from the column densities , although for the ones that dust continuum data are available the masses based on the two datasets are fairly consistent .",
    "the rotation temperatures of the hot cores measured from the first two inversion transitions of should be treated as the lower limits , while the real temperatures at central part of the hot cores could be @xmath27300  k.    assuming a uniform radial density profile , the virial parameters of the hot cores are all smaller than 1 , similar to what we find in g28.53 .",
    "the gas temperatures of the hot cores are usually @xmath2730  k , thus their thermal linewidths are larger than those of g28.53 . however as shown in the non - thermal linewidths",
    "are always dominant over the thermal linewidths , thus the increase of linewidths by a factor of 23 from g28.53 cores to hot cores is mainly due to the non - thermal motions .",
    "therefore , the fact that the virial parameters are consistent from g28.53 cores to hot cores indicates that turbulence is essential in supporting the cores against gravity constantly in the evolution of dense cores .",
    "given that the hot cores are more massive than the irdc cores ( typically a few hundreds of m@xmath53 ) , to maintain a similar virial parameter , turbulence must be enhanced . the feedback from protostars in hot cores , including outflows and heating , could increase the gas temperatures , and more importantly , inject turbulent energy into gas , which maintains a steady accretion of dense gas to form high - mass stars .",
    "as one of the most important energy sources against gravity other than kinetic energy , magnetic field is not considered since we do not have measurements in this cloud . if the typical magnetic field strength @xmath54  mg in high - mass star formation regions @xcite is added into the virial relation , and assuming a uniform radial density profile , then @xmath55 in which @xmath56 is the alfvnic velocity .",
    "the total virial mass @xmath57 is @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the magnetic virial mass . here",
    "@xmath61 is the traditionally defined critical mass for a spherical cloud of uniform density with a uniform magnetic field @xcite . only when @xmath62 does the magnetic virial mass @xmath63 we defined equal @xmath64 .",
    "in this case , the virial parameters of mm1-p1/p2 and mm5-p1 are still smaller than 1 , while all the other cores have @xmath65 .",
    "this might explain why signatures of star formation are only detected in these three cores ( see section [ subsec : disc_mm15 ] )",
    ". therefore , magnetic field might also be an important factor in determining the dynamics of the cores .",
    "in several previous studies @xcite , mm1 was classified as ` quiescent ' with no signs of high - mass star formation , given the lack of molecular lines and absence of associated infrared sources .",
    "our observation suggests that mm1 is not quiescent , but is already forming stars . in mm1 ,",
    "the two most massive cores are associated with outflows .",
    "the two h@xmath66o masers w1 and w4 could also trace star formation . in total",
    "there are at least four star forming sites .    with a mass of 56.0",
    ", mm1-p1 is the most massive core we resolved in g28.53 .",
    "it remains unresolved in the 345  ghz sma observations at an angular resolution of @xmath67 @xcite , and only one outflow was detected , both of which suggest there might be a single protostellar object embedded in mm1-p1 , which will form a star or a multiple stellar system .",
    "the large core mass and the energetic outflow suggest high - mass star formation .",
    "the small virial parameter of 0.090.2 suggests that it is strongly self - gravitating .",
    "the sma line emission at @xmath487 in mm1-p1 presents a flatten morphology perpendicular to the co outflow , with a velocity gradient of @xmath43   across @xmath40.1  pc , shown in a. with a critical density of @xmath410@xmath68  , the line emission is tracing a dense gas component , likely a rotating envelope surrounding a protostellar disk .",
    "these results suggest that there might be an outflow - disk system within mm1-p1 .      as @xcite pointed out , mm1-p2 fragments into three condensations among which the most massive one might form high - mass stars , based on the broad line wings in singled - dish spectra of the outflow tracer sio . with the sma 230  ghz observations we detect the outflow directly , although it is uncertain which one of the three condensations in @xcite is driving this outflow .",
    "the outflows associated with mm1-p1/p2 are parallel to each other .",
    "similar nearly parallel outflows have been found in other irdcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a possible interpretation is that the cores are fragmented from an initially rotating clump , then their rotation axes will tend to be parallel to the initial rotation axis of the clump given conservations of angular momentum , which leads to parallel disks and finally parallel outflows . as shown in",
    ", the velocity field of the 87   component of gbt of mm1 presents a gradient at a position angle of 4050 north to east , perpendicular to the outflows .",
    "if this velocity gradient is interpreted as rotation , then the mm1 clump is likely spinning slowly , with an axis parallel to the outflow orientations , which supports the rotating clump fragmentation scenario .",
    "however , note that such velocity gradient can also be reproduced with random motions @xcite . in addition",
    ", magnetic field in the clumps might also be important in aligning the outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by regulating the 0.1  pc scale magnetic fields in the cores thus affecting the orientation of the accretion disks .",
    "the two masers in mm1 could pinpoint another two star forming sites .",
    "both are associated with weak ( 3@xmath19 ) 345  ghz dust emission in the sma map of @xcite . between them , w1 is more interesting because of its association with line emission and an infrared source .",
    "three more cores were detected at levels of @xmath276@xmath19 in the southern part of mm1 in the sma 345  ghz dust emission map of @xcite .",
    "therefore , with at least eleven cores , among which four are forming stars , mm1 will probably form a star cluster . mm1-p1 and the most massive condensation in mm1-p2 are two promising high - mass star formation sites .    in",
    ", mm1 is the most infrared extinct part in g28.53 , and it remains dark up to 70   @xcite , which leads to a low luminosity ( e.g.  200   in * ? ? ? * ) . in contrast , mm5 starts to be bright in 24   and has a larger luminosity @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the more active star formation and the smaller luminosity of mm1 could be due to heavy extinction : if the 85   component was at the front then it could extinct infrared emission produced by star formation in the 87   component behind it .",
    "even if the 87   component is not shielded , the self - extinction ( @xmath69 up to 50100 given a column density of @xmath1710@xmath70  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could keep it infrared dark .",
    "this is similar to the irdc g30.88 + 0.03 in @xcite , which has a small luminosity of 460   but presents masers and massive cores , and there are also two velocity components along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , infrared emission only is not sufficient in assessing star formation activity , especially in the presence of multiple velocity components , while spectral lines like can be used to resolve multiple components and trace deeply embedded star formation .",
    "previous studies @xcite classified mm5 as ` intermediate ' , based on infrared emission and chemistry , e.g.  it contains a 24   source but not a green fuzzy at 4.5  . our results support this conclusion , with mm5 in an ` intermediate ' evolutionary phase between the ` active ' mm1 and the ` quiescent ' mm7/8 .",
    "a bipolar outflow in the north - south direction is found in mm5 , while the angular resolution is not good enough to tell which of the three cores it originates from .",
    "all three cores are self - gravitating , with masses between 24 and 38  , thus are equally possible to harbor protostars .",
    "the outflow is less energetic and slightly younger than the two outflows in mm1 , suggesting that the star formation in mm5 is less active and possibly at an earlier phase than in mm1",
    ".    with a critical density of @xmath1710@xmath68   @xcite , usually traces dense gas . as shown in b , the sma detected line emission associated with mm5-p1/p2 , which is elongated in the east - west direction and presents a velocity gradient across mm5-p1 and mm5-p2 , perpendicular to the outflow .",
    "therefore , the emission is likely tracing a dense envelope that encloses the two cores , and perhaps spins slowly , which might feed material into disks around embedded protostars .",
    "the two cores , mm5-p1/p2 , are hence the potential driving sources of the outflow .    the rotation temperatures in mm5 , using either combined data or vla data only , are generally @xmath1615  k. we did not find any signature of heating associated with outflows or hot cores",
    ". the protostars in the three cores , if there are any , must be at an early stage when accretion or stellar luminosity is not strong enough to heat the ambient gas .",
    "note that @xcite derived a dust temperature of 30  k and a luminosity of @xmath1710@xmath71   for mm5 , from sed modeling .",
    "the robustness of this result suffers from the fact that they used fluxes in only four bands ( 24  , 450  , 850  , 1.2  mm ) , making the modeling less constrained at around 100   which is supposed to be the peak of the sed .",
    "recently @xcite fitted the sed of g28.53 using herschel 150500   data and derived a dust temperature of 1618  k for mm5 , consistent with our rotation temperature , which is expected since at high densities ( @xmath1710@xmath72  ) the gas and dust temperatures are usually well coupled @xcite .",
    "the results of mm1 and mm7 which include data from more bands in @xcite are in general consistent with ours .    with a total mass of @xmath4400   @xcite , mm5 has sufficient dense gas to form @xmath480   stars assuming a star formation efficiency of 20% .",
    "the 24   point source , the outflow , the spinning envelope , and the self - gravitating cores all suggest the capability of high - mass star formation , while the absence of hot core tracers such as and the low temperature indicate little stellar feedback .      the three cores in mm7/8 are marginally gravitationally bound , and do not show any star formation signature such as outflow , maser , infrared source or increased temperature . as previous studies suggested @xcite , these two clumps are likely ` quiescent ' , with no current star formation .",
    "however , given that the cores are self - gravitating , mm7/8 still have the potential of collapsing and eventually forming stars .",
    "their masses are @xmath4300 and @xmath4240   respectively using the fluxes and @xmath28 reported in @xcite , which are comparable to the mass of mm5 . with mean densities of 1@xmath7310@xmath332@xmath7310@xmath33  , the free fall time scale is 0.20.4  myr .",
    "if the cores are indeed collapsing even after taking magnetic field into account , then star formation will start in such a time scale .",
    "it is also worth noting that mm7/8 are embedded in a filamentary structure , which presents a velocity gradient of 1   along the major axis , which is consistent with a gas stream falling into the main part of g28.53 , evidenced by the gbt velocities in .",
    "in fact , g28.53 is the densest and coldest part of a large filament which extends @xmath460  pc ( wang et al . submitted ) , in which mm7/8 connect the main part of g28.53 and the large filament . assuming a proper motion velocity of @xmath412   and a projected distance of 23  pc , mm7/8 will collide with mm1 in 13  myr . for reference ,",
    "the free fall time scale of the main part of g28.53 ( mm1/2/3/4/6 , @xmath43.5@xmath7310@xmath71   within 3  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath41.4  myr .",
    "therefore mm7/8 will probably first form stars , then dynamically interact with the other clumps at the center of g28.53 due to their gravitational pull .",
    "this picture is similar to what @xcite proposed for the high - mass cluster formation in g10.6@xmath00.4 , in which fragmentation occurs in filaments on free fall time scales , while the filaments themselves fall into a central dense region where ob clusters are forming through a global contraction .",
    "the multi - frequency observations of the irdc g28.53 have revealed twelve 0.1  pc scale cores in four massive clumps .",
    "we obtain gas temperatures and kinematics from vla and gbt lines , and derive core masses based on the sma dust continuum emission .",
    "we also assess star formation associated with these cores using vla masers and the sma spectral lines .",
    "our conclusions are :    1 .   when 1  pc scale clumps in irdcs fragment into 0.1  pc scale cores , turbulent pressure is more important than thermal pressure in supporting the gas .",
    "therefore , it is possible to form super - thermal - jeans - mass cores that are massive enough to harbor high - mass stars .",
    "2 .   all of the cores we find in irdc g28.53 have a virial parameter @xmath50 ( @xmath74 ) smaller than 1 assuming a radial density profile of @xmath44 , and nine out of twelve cores still have @xmath49 even assuming a constant radial density , suggesting that they are all gravitationally bound , if magnetic field , rotation , or external pressure are not considered .",
    "the virial parameters of the three star forming cores in mm1 and mm5 are @xmath75 , therefore these cores are strongly self - gravitating . even if magnetic field is taken into account , these three cores are still gravitationally bound , consistent with star formation activities associated with them .",
    "3 .   the virial parameters of the cores in g28.53 and in several hot core sources are all @xmath40.21 , even though gas temperatures of hot cores are much higher , suggesting turbulent motions are more important than thermal motions in supporting massive cores against gravity as they collapse .",
    "the consistent virial parameters from the lower - mass cores in irdcs to the more massive hot cores suggest that turbulence is enhanced as cores are accreting , which is essential in maintaining a steady accumulation of dense gas thus forming high - mass stars .",
    "the most massive core in mm1 is found at the center of this clump .",
    "the energetic outflow traced by co and a disk - like structure traced by suggest that there might be an outflow - disk system in this core . with a mass of 56",
    ", it will form a high - mass star or multiple stellar system .",
    "5 .   in addition ,",
    "mm1 harbors another three possible star forming sites , as well as seven cores that are likely quiescent but also massive .",
    "therefore mm1 might be a progenitor of high - mass star cluster , rather than a quiescent clump suggested by previous studies .",
    "in contrast , mm5 clump is intermediate in the evolutionary stage and mm7/8 clumps are quiescent .",
    "however they have the potential to continue fragment and collapse until star formation starts as in mm1 .",
    "mm7/8 might be falling into the main part of g28.53 due to its gravitational pull while fragmentation occurs in themselves , which provides a way to form star clusters .",

    "<S> we identity 12 dense cores at 0.1  pc scale based on submillimeter continuum , and obtain their physical properties using and continuum data . by comparing the jeans masses of cores with the core masses </S>",
    "<S> , we find that turbulent pressure is important in supporting the gas when 1  pc scale clumps fragment into 0.1  pc scale cores . </S>",
    "<S> all cores have a virial parameter smaller than 1 assuming a inverse squared radial density profile , suggesting they are gravitationally bound , and the three most promising star forming cores have a virial parameter smaller than 1 even taking magnetic field into account . </S>",
    "<S> we also associate the cores with star formation activities revealed by outflows , masers , or infrared sources . unlike what previous studies suggested , mm1 turns out to harbor a few star forming cores and is likely a progenitor of high - mass star cluster . </S>",
    "<S> mm5 is intermediate while mm7/8 are quiescent in terms of star formation , but they also harbor gravitationally bound dense cores and have the potential of forming stars as in mm1 . </S>"
