    "this section gives an overview of the setup .",
    "given @xmath20 , one can always choose an almost complex structure @xmath2 compatible with @xmath21 , i.e. a bundle map @xmath22 with @xmath23 and so that , for tangent vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a riemannian metric .",
    "let @xmath27 be the space of such @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath28 , a map @xmath29 from a complex curve @xmath30 is _ @xmath2-holomorphic _ if it satisfies @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath2-holomorphic maps from a smooth connected domain @xmath30 with ( distinct ) marked points @xmath33 gives a space @xmath34 labeled by the genus @xmath35 of @xmath30 , the number @xmath36 of marked points , and the class @xmath37 that the image represents .",
    "the space ( [ 1.modulispace ] ) has a natural compactification , which can be built in two steps .",
    "first , when @xmath1 is a single point and @xmath38 , ( [ 1.modulispace ] ) is the deligne - mumford space of curves .",
    "that has a compactification @xmath39 consisting of stable connected curves with arithmetic genus @xmath35 and @xmath36 marked points .",
    "( a curve is _ stable _ if ( i ) it has only nodal singular points , none of which are marked points , and ( ii ) each irreducible component of genus @xmath40 has at least @xmath41 marked or nodal points . )",
    "the deligne - mumford compactification is an orbifold , and is a complex projective variety of dimension @xmath42 .",
    "a @xmath2-holomorphic map from a connected nodal curve is _ stable _ if the image of every unstable irreducible component of @xmath30 represents a non - trivial element of @xmath43 . for technical reasons it is helpful , following ruan and tian @xcite , @xcite to replace ( [ 1.holomorphicmapeq ] ) by the inhomogeneous equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an appropriate perturbation term . with that , the space of stable maps @xmath46 is compact and , for generic @xmath47 , is an orbifold with @xmath48 + 2k \\label{1.dim}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the canonical class of @xmath51 .",
    "this space has an orientation and comes with a map @xmath52 that associates to a stable map @xmath53 the stabilization @xmath54 of its domain ( obtained by collapsing all unstable irreducible components of @xmath30 to points ) and the images @xmath55 of the marked points .",
    "we can then pushforward the fundamental homology class of @xmath56 by the map ( [ 1,evalmap ] ) and evaluating on cohomology classes @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting numbers are the gromov - witten invariants @xmath59\\right).\\ ] ] standard cobordism arguments show that these are independent of the choice of generic @xmath47 , and hence are symplectic invariants .",
    "once we have fixed a space @xmath1 , we will often write gw invariants @xmath60    the gromov - witten invariants are counts of the number of perturbed holomorphic maps that satisfy the constraints imposed by the @xmath61 and @xmath62 classes .",
    "the @xmath62 constraints have a simple geometric interpretation : if one chooses pseudomanifolds @xmath63 representing the poincar dual of @xmath64 , then , assuming that @xmath47 is generic and that the @xmath65 are in general position , @xmath66 is an oriented count of the number of @xmath47-holomorphic maps @xmath14 from a genus @xmath35 curve with @xmath36 marked points @xmath67 that represent the class @xmath68 and satisfy @xmath69 for each @xmath70 .",
    "this geometric interpretation implies several properties of the gw invariants .",
    "for example , the invariant vanishes unless the total degree of the constraints ( the cohomology classes @xmath61 and @xmath64 ) is equal to the dimension ( [ 1.dim ] ) of the space of stable maps .",
    "an especially useful property is the `` divisor axiom '' : for any degree 2 constraint @xmath71 with poincar dual @xmath72 we have @xmath73 this holds because , when @xmath72 is in general position , the image of any stable map @xmath74 representing @xmath68 intersects @xmath72 transversally at @xmath75 points , so there are exactly @xmath75 possibilities for the first marked point .",
    "the geometric meaning of the @xmath76 constraints is more subtle .",
    "but certain @xmath76 constraints play an important role in applications , as the examples in the next two sections show .",
    "the deligne - mumford space @xmath77 has a complex codimension - one subset whose generic element is a stable curve with one node . consider the case , shown below , in which the node separates @xmath30 into two components @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the genus decomposes as @xmath80 and , because the node can not be a marked point , the marked and nodal points separate into two sets @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "there is then a map    @xmath84        .4 cm defined by identifying @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "we denote the poincar dual of the image of this map @xmath87 by @xmath88 .",
    "gromov - witten invariants with constraint @xmath88 @xmath89 give counts for stable holomorphic maps from nodal domains of the type shown .",
    "alternatively , a map @xmath74 from such a nodal domain can also be thought of as a pair of maps @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "the set of such pairs @xmath93 can be expressed in terms of the evaluation maps @xmath94 that record the images of the marked points @xmath95 and @xmath86 : the stable maps from nodal domains are those in the inverse image of the diagonal @xmath96 under ( [ evalmap1 ] ) .",
    "thus the nodal maps define a homology class @xmath97 \\otimes\\left[\\overline{{\\mathcal m } } _ { g_{2},k_{2}+1}(x , a_2)\\right ] \\",

    "we can go one step further .",
    "note that the class ( [ compostion1 ] ) depends only on the homology class of the diagonal in @xmath98 .",
    "we can then use the `` splitting the diagonal '' formula : if @xmath99 and @xmath100 are bases of @xmath101 dual by the intersection form , we have @xmath102 = \\sum_a h^{a } \\otimes h_{a}.\\ ] ] inserting this in ( [ compostion1 ] ) and evaluating on classes",
    "@xmath103 then yields the first splitting formula .",
    "[ cl ] with @xmath87 as in figure 1 and any classes @xmath104 , we have    @xmath105    there is a parallel story for domains with non - separating nodes .",
    "a genus @xmath106 curve with @xmath107 marked points becomes a genus @xmath35 curve with @xmath36 marked points and a single non - separating node by identifying the last two marked points .",
    "that gives a map    @xmath108        .5 cm    .3 cm stable maps from such genus @xmath35 domains are counted by gw invariants constrained by the poincar dual @xmath109 of the image of this map @xmath110 .",
    "alternatively , they are counted by maps @xmath111 from genus @xmath106 domains with @xmath107 marked points and with @xmath112 ; this constraint is the pullback of @xmath113 under the evaluation map @xmath114 analogous to ( [ compostion1 ] ) . again splitting the diagonal in homology",
    ", we get the splitting formula for non - separating nodes : @xmath115 where the last equality holds on 4-manifolds .",
    "the splitting formulas relate gw invariants in a given genus to invariants with smaller symplectic area or lower genus .",
    "we will see later how such relations can be encoded as differential equations on generating functions for gw invariants and used to help determine those invariants .",
    "gw invariants constrained by cohomology classes in @xmath116 can sometimes be rewritten and simplified using the collection of formula called the `` topological recussion relations '' ( trr ) .",
    "trr formulas will play an important role in later sections .",
    "the basic idea is the same as in the previous section : relations among cohomology classes in deligne - mumford spaces give rise to relations among gw invariants . here",
    "we will explain one particular trr formula , which involves genus 1 gw invariants constrained by `` descendent classes '' .",
    "we also describe the geometric meaning of those constraints in simple cases .",
    "the article @xcite of e. getzler is a good reference for this material .",
    "this genus 1 trr formula originates from a fact about the space @xmath117 of complex structures on a torus with one marked point .",
    "this is an orbifold whose boundary @xmath118 consists of a single point , which corresponds to a curve of geometric genus @xmath119 with one non - separating node .",
    "there is a natural line bundle @xmath120 whose fiber at a curve @xmath121 is the cotangent space @xmath122 .",
    "the chern class of @xmath123 , which is usually denoted by @xmath124 , is a multiple of the poincar dual of the orbifold fundamental class @xmath125 of the boundary :    @xmath126    there is a corresponding story on the space @xmath127 of stable maps into @xmath1 .",
    "there is again a line bundle @xmath128 whose fiber at @xmath129 is the cotangent space @xmath122 ; its first chern class is denoted by @xmath130 . by the definition of stable map , each irreducible component of the domain is either a stable curve or has non - trivial image in @xmath1 . under the stabilization map @xmath131 of ( [ 1,evalmap ] ) , the inverse image of @xmath125 consists of maps from a rational nodal curve , possibly with one or more unstable @xmath119 `` bubble '' components . over the open dense set of @xmath132 consisting of maps with irreducible domains ,",
    "the relative cotangent bundles are related by @xmath133 , but that is not the case for maps with unstable components  there are correction terms .",
    "the correct relation can be written symbolically as @xmath134 this equation requires some interpretation .",
    "the pictures represent the ( real ) codimension two stratum of @xmath127 that is the closure of the set of all stable maps whose domains have the form shown ; in particular the `` pinched torus '' in the middle picture stands for @xmath135 . with that understood ,",
    "the symbolic formula ( [ trr ] ) says that the gw invariant with constraint @xmath130 is equal to @xmath136 the invariant with constraint @xmath125 plus the contribution of the stratum whose generic element consists of stable maps from a smooth torus with one @xmath119 bubble attached .    in practice",
    ", the gw invariants constrained by @xmath125 ( the middle picture ) can be expressed in terms of genus 0 gw invariants using the splitting formula of gw invariants .",
    "the invariants constained as in the last picture can similarly be expressed in terms of invariants corresponding to the two components .",
    "we can use @xmath130 to impose constraints on gw invariants .",
    "that is commonly done by using the evaluation map @xmath137 ( which simply evaluates each stable map at the given marked point ) to introduce `` descendent classes '' @xmath138 for each cohomology class @xmath139 . with more marked points",
    ", we have a similar evaluation map @xmath140 for each marked point and line bundles @xmath141 ( whose fiber at @xmath142 is the cotangent space @xmath143 ) and corresponding descendent classes @xmath144 where @xmath145 . we then get constrained gw invariants by evaluating products of such descendent classes on the fundamental homology class of the space of stable maps .",
    "the simplest example occurs when @xmath146 is equal to the dimension of the moduli space ; then the constrained invariant with one descendent @xmath147\\ ] ] is a number .",
    "this invariant ( [ descendentgw ] ) has a nice geometric interpretation when the poincar dual of @xmath62 can be represented by a codimension two @xmath2-invariant submanifold @xmath148 with trivial normal bundle ( as happens in the computation of the next section ) . in that case",
    "we can fix a trivialization of the normal bundle to @xmath149 and make two observations :    @xmath150   the `` cutdown moduli space '' @xmath151 consisting of all maps @xmath152 which take the marked point @xmath153 onto @xmath149 represents @xmath154 $ ] .",
    "@xmath150   for each map @xmath152 , the normal component @xmath155 of the differential at the marked point @xmath153 is an element of @xmath156 .",
    "thus @xmath157 is a section of @xmath158 .",
    "the zeros of this section along @xmath159 represent the invariant ( [ descendentgw ] ) _ provided those zeros occur only at maps in @xmath159 that have no components with images in @xmath149_.    thus , when this last italicized caveat holds , the descendent number ( [ descendentgw ] ) counts the number of stable maps @xmath14 with @xmath160 and @xmath161 , that is , those maps whose image contacts @xmath162 to order at least two at @xmath163 .",
    "this story extends to higher order contact .",
    "when @xmath164 vanishes to order @xmath165 at @xmath166 , the leading coefficient in its taylor series is naturally an element of @xmath167 .",
    "intrinsically , the first @xmath165 terms in the taylor series is a section of the jet bundle @xmath168 , and we have the `` jet exact sequence '' @xmath169 globally over the set of stable maps satisfying conditions a ) and b ) above , the first @xmath165 terms in the taylor series give a section of a relative jet bundle @xmath170 whose euler class , computed from the jet exact sequence and induction , is @xmath171 thus it is natural to consider not just @xmath172 , but also the more general descendent classes @xmath173 defined by @xmath174 and the corresponding descendent invariants @xmath175 which one sees in the literature . in the simplest case of a single marked point , the discussion above shows that the invariant @xmath176 has a straightforward interpretation whenever conditions in a ) and b ) above hold : it counts the number of stable maps @xmath14 whose image contacts @xmath149 to order @xmath177 at the point @xmath163 .",
    "we will use this geometric interpretation ( in the case @xmath178 ) in section 5 below .",
    "another powerful compuational tool is the symplectic sum formula .",
    "this can be viewed as a fact about maps into a symplectic fibration . consider a fibration @xmath179 over the disk whose fibers are smooth symplectic manifolds for @xmath180 .",
    "l4.4 cm        suppose that the central fiber @xmath181 is the singular symplectic manifold @xmath182 obtained by attaching smooth symplectic manifolds @xmath1 and @xmath6 along a common symplectic submanifold @xmath162 of real codimension two , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "in this situation the generic fiber @xmath183 is a symplectic smoothing of @xmath184 and is unique up to symplectic deformation .",
    "that deformation class is called the _ symplectic sum _ of @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "alternatively , one can construct symplectic sums by hand .",
    "fix a symplectic manifold @xmath1 with a symplectic codimension two submanifold @xmath162 .",
    "suppose we are given a similar pair @xmath187 with a symplectic identification between the two copies of @xmath162 such that , under that identification , the normal bundles @xmath188 and @xmath189 are dual as complex vector bundles .",
    "we can then glue @xmath1 to @xmath6 along @xmath162 and `` round the corner '' , essentially by replacing the crossing @xmath190 by @xmath191 in coordinates normal to @xmath162 .",
    "for @xmath192 the resulting manifold @xmath183 is smooth and symplectic  this is the symplectic sum . in fact , this construction creates a family @xmath193 that together form a symplectic fibration as above .",
    "the `` symplectic sum formula '' developed in @xcite and @xcite expresses the gw invariants of the symplectic sum @xmath183 in terms of invariants of @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "the derivation begins by considering what happens to @xmath2-holomorphic maps into @xmath183 as @xmath194 . by the compactness theorem for @xmath2-holomorphic maps ( for maps into @xmath195 ) ,",
    "these limit to maps into @xmath196 , which can be separated into components on the @xmath1 and @xmath6 sides .",
    "however , there are several complications .",
    "of @xmath2-holomorphic maps into @xmath183 as @xmath197 . ]",
    "one complication is apparent in figure 4 : connected curves in @xmath183 may limit to curves whose restrictions to @xmath1 and @xmath6 are not connected , as figure 4 shows .",
    "for that reason the gw invariant , which counts stable curves from a connected domain , is not the appropriate invariant for expressing a sum formula .",
    "instead one should work with the `` gromov - taubes '' invariant @xmath198 , which counts stable maps from domains that need not be connected .",
    "this is not a substantive change : one can move between the gw invariants and the gt invariants contain the same information and there are combinatorial formulas relating them .",
    "a more substantial complication arises from the requirement , needed for the compactness theorem mentioned above , that the the almost complex structures on @xmath1 and @xmath6 match along @xmath162 and extend smoothly to the fibers of the fibration @xmath195 .",
    "for that reason , it is necessary to restrict to pairs @xmath47 that satisfy a certain `` @xmath162-compatibility '' condition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "that condition implies , in particular , that @xmath162 is a @xmath2-holomorphic submanifold .",
    "there is a price to pay for this specialization .",
    "because we can no longer perturb @xmath47 along @xmath162 at will , we do not have enough freedom to arrange that the limit curves are transverse to @xmath162 .",
    "in fact , the images of the limit maps into @xmath184 can meet @xmath162 at points with multiplicities and , worse , may have components may be mapped entirely into @xmath162 .    to count stable maps into @xmath184",
    "we look first at maps into @xmath1 that have no components mapped into @xmath162 .",
    "these form a moduli space which is the union of components @xmath199 labeled by the multiplicities @xmath200 of the intersection points with @xmath162 .",
    "each @xmath199 can be compactified .",
    "those compact moduli spaces come with evaluation maps like ( [ 1,evalmap ] ) that keep track of the domain curve , the images of the marked points , and the relative homology class of the image ( details are given in @xcite ) . repeating the construction of gw invariants ,",
    "we then obtain _ relative gromov - witten invariants _ @xmath201 that count the number of stable maps into @xmath1 that meet @xmath162 with specified multiplicities .",
    "a third complication is the fact that the squeezing process is not injective .",
    "a precise analysis reveals that each map into @xmath184 that meets @xmath162 with multiplicities @xmath200 is the limit of @xmath202 distinct maps into @xmath183 .",
    "the maps within such a `` cluster '' have almost the same image but have different domains . as @xmath197 the cluster coalesces , limiting to a single map .",
    "the limit process is reversed by a standard approach that goes back to taubes and donaldson : construct a space of approximately holomorphic maps ( which incorporates the clustering phenomenon ) , then correct the approximate maps to true holomorphic maps using a fixed point theorem .",
    "the upshot is a precise statement , at the level of moduli spaces , of the fact that stable maps into @xmath183 for small @xmath203 are in one - to - one correspondence to the clusters associated with pairs of maps @xmath204 into @xmath1 and @xmath6 that intersect @xmath162 at the same points with the same multiplicities .",
    "there remains the issue of curves `` sinking into the neck '' in the limit @xmath197 .",
    "this is dealt with using a renormalization argument .",
    "for that , we consider the ruled manifold @xmath205 , which is the @xmath206 bundle over @xmath162 obtained by adding an infinity section to the normal bundle to @xmath162 .",
    "we can then glue @xmath1 to @xmath6 through a series of @xmath207 copies of @xmath208 , obtaining a space which is singular along @xmath209 copies of @xmath162 .",
    "introducing smoothing parameters @xmath210 and applying the symplectic sum construction gives a fibration @xmath211 .",
    "this is similar to the fibration of figure 3 , but now the fibers near the central fiber are manifolds @xmath183 with @xmath209 necks , as shown in figure 5 for @xmath212 .",
    "several times catches prevents curves from sinking into the neck . ]",
    "an energy bound shows that , when one takes @xmath207 sufficiently large and lets @xmath197 , the limit maps have no components sinking into most necks of @xmath184 .",
    "squeezing some or all of those necks decomposes the curves in @xmath183 into curves in @xmath1 joined to curves in @xmath6 by a chain of curves in intermediate spaces @xmath208 , and the previous analysis applies to each . working through the combinatorics",
    ", one finds that the total contribution of the entire region between @xmath1 and @xmath6 is given by a certain @xmath198 invariant @xmath213 of @xmath208 .",
    "this `` @xmath214-matrix '' @xmath213 keeps track of how the genus , homology class , and intersection points with @xmath162 are `` scattered '' as the images of stable maps pass through the intermediate regions of figure 5 .",
    "* symplectic sum theorem*_let @xmath215 be the symplectic sum of @xmath185 and @xmath187 .",
    "then the gromov - taubes invariant of @xmath215 is given in terms of the relative invariants of @xmath1 and @xmath6 by @xmath216 where @xmath217 is a certain ` convolution operation ' and @xmath213 is a certain gw invariant of the ruled manifold @xmath208 . _",
    "the formulas of the previous sections describe the behavior of gw invariants under various cut - and - paste operations .",
    "we referred to those as `` compuational tools '' , but have not yet done any computations or shown that they have practical value .",
    "we now remedy that by presenting a striking application : calculating gw invariants for the rational elliptic surface @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 is the simplest khler surface that fibers over the 2-sphere with elliptic curves as fibers ( that is , the fibers are tori with varying complex structure ) .",
    "one standard construction goes as follows .",
    "choose two generic degree 3 curves in @xmath218 .",
    "these are elliptic curves , given as the zero sets of cubic polynomials @xmath219 in homogeneous coordinates , which intersect at 9 points .",
    "blowing up @xmath218 at those 9 points gives the surface @xmath7 .",
    "it comes with 9 exceptional curves .",
    "furthermore , the curves in the linear system @xmath220 lift to a family of elliptic curves @xmath221 in @xmath7 so that ( a ) @xmath222 and @xmath223 are disjoint for @xmath224 , ( b ) every point of @xmath7 lies on one and only @xmath222 , and ( c ) each @xmath222 intersects each exceptional curve in one point with multiplicity one . thus the @xmath222 are the fiber of a fibration @xmath225 and each exceptional curve is a section of that fibration . for generic cubic polynomials",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath35 , this fibration has exactly 12 nodal fibers as shown in figure 6 below .",
    "varying the blowup points gives different complex structures on @xmath7 but , up to deformation , there is a single symplectic structure on @xmath7 .",
    "the homology @xmath226 is generated by the 9 section classes @xmath227 represented by the exceptional curves and by the class @xmath228 of a generic fiber . these satisfy @xmath229 and altogether the intersection form of @xmath7 is the sum @xmath230 of the @xmath231 matrix and the @xmath232 hyperbolic matrix .",
    "the adjunction formula shows that the canonical class is @xmath233 .",
    "the gw invariant of the fiber class is especially important : it is @xmath234 ( see example 9.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "now fix one section @xmath235 and consider the classes @xmath236 for @xmath237 . for generic @xmath238 , the space of stable maps",
    "@xmath239 form a moduli space with dimension given by ( [ 1.dim ] ) : @xmath240 \\ = \\ 0.\\ ] ] thus for each @xmath241 this moduli space is a finite set of points ( with sign ) .",
    "we wish to compute the gw invariants that count the signed points in those moduli spaces .",
    "* problem a *  find the genus 0 gromov - witten invariants @xmath242 of @xmath7 .",
    "equivalently , find the generating function @xmath243    notice that any class @xmath236 with @xmath244 is represented by a @xmath238-holomorphic map for generic @xmath47 .",
    "as @xmath245 those maps limit to a @xmath2-holomorphic map representing @xmath236 . by also varying @xmath2 , we see that @xmath236 has a holomorphic representative for the @xmath2 of a complex elliptic structure on @xmath7 , for which we know that @xmath214 also has a holomorphic representative . since distinct holomorphic curves have non - negative intersection we conclude that @xmath246 or @xmath247 .",
    "thus there is no lose of generality in restricting the above sum to @xmath248 .",
    "there is a similar problem for genus 1 invariants .",
    "note that , by ( [ 1.dim ] ) , the space of stable maps from a genus @xmath249 domain into @xmath7 has dimension 2 .",
    "we can get a gw invariant by adding a marked point ( thereby increasing the dimension of space of stable maps to 4 ) and imposing the codimension 4 constraint @xmath250 .",

    "first , we can expand the constraint @xmath256 using the trr formula ( [ trr ] ) : @xmath257 where the arrows to @xmath258 indicate that the marked points must be mapped onto @xmath258 .",

    ", we see that the maps corresponding to the last picture of ( [ 5.picture ] ) contribute @xmath272 the invariant @xmath273 is a count of degenerate maps and one can show by hand that @xmath274 ( see @xcite  15 ) .",
    "the invariant @xmath275 counts the @xmath241-fold coverings of a torus by tori and hence it is the sum of all divisors of @xmath241 , which is denoted by @xmath276 .",
    "we set @xmath277 then , combining the last several equations yields a differential equation that encodes the `` splitting the domain '' trr relation :    @xmath278    we will next derive a similar differential equation by splitting the target . let @xmath162 be one of the fibers of @xmath225 . setting @xmath279 , let @xmath280 be a fiber of @xmath281 .",
    "since @xmath162 and @xmath280 have trivial normal bundles , we can identify them and form the symplectic sum .",

    "we will apply the symplectic sum formula ( [ 3.ssf ] ) , taking the constraint @xmath250 with @xmath228 represented by a fiber @xmath258 on the @xmath283 side .",

    ", one should think about the proof , rather than the formula itself .",
    "as we squeeze the neck in figure 6 by letting @xmath285 , maps from genus 1 domains that represent @xmath236 limit to maps @xmath286 and @xmath287 with ( genus @xmath78)+ ( genus @xmath79)=1 and whose images meet at a point of @xmath162 and with the image of @xmath35 contacting @xmath258 in a way that satisfies the constraint @xmath250 .    first consider the possibility that @xmath79 has genus 0 .",
    "then @xmath288 represents @xmath289 for some @xmath290 , where @xmath214 and @xmath228 are the section and fiber classes of @xmath283 .",
    "composing @xmath35 with the projection @xmath291 gives a map @xmath268 , which must be zero in homology , so @xmath292 .",
    "stability implies that @xmath79 is a smooth 2-sphere representing @xmath214 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath258 has trivial normal bundle and the image of @xmath35 has no components in @xmath258 . as we saw in section 3",
    ", in that situation @xmath250 is the constraint that the image of @xmath35 contacts @xmath258 to second order .",
    "but @xmath293 , so that is impossible for a fibered complex structure on @xmath283 . a limiting argument shows that the same is true for generic @xmath2 , so @xmath294 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath78 has genus 0 and @xmath79 has genus 1 .",
    "exactly the same argument shows that the limit curve can not have any curves in the middle regions shown in figure 5 .",
    "consequently , the matrix @xmath213 in the symplectic sum formula ( [ 3.ssf ] ) is the identity and the relative and absolute invariants are the same .",
    "furthermore , since the maps intersect @xmath162 at a single point with multiplicity 1 the domains @xmath78 and @xmath79 are connected and the multiplicity issues mentioned in section 4 do not arise , and the convolution in ( [ 3.ssf ] ) is simply the product of the generating functions .",
    "since @xmath78 has genus 0 the generating function on the @xmath7 side is just @xmath254 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath295    we can calculate the generating function for @xmath283 by applying trr exactly as in ( [ 5.2 ] ) and ( [ 5.3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , since @xmath296 the contribution of the first picture of ( [ 5.picture ] ) , given by the left - hand side of ( [ 5.2 ] ) , is zero . moreover , the invariant @xmath297 for @xmath298 , so the contribution of the second picture of ( [ 5.picture ] ) , is given by the last line of ( [ 5.3 ] ) with @xmath254 replaced by @xmath299 . that is evaluated using ( [ pt - map ] ) , noting that the canonical class of @xmath283 is @xmath300 , and again recognizing that @xmath301 is twice the number of @xmath241-fold covers of a torus by a torus ( since , for generic @xmath2 , @xmath283 has exactly two holomorphic fibers in the fiber class ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath302    with that , the symplectic sum formula corresponding to the decomposition of figure 6 has the simple form    @xmath303    now the punch line : equating formulas ( [ f - trr ] ) and ( [ f - sum ] ) gives the ode @xmath304 with the initial condition @xmath305 .",
    "the solution of this ode is given by @xmath306 and we can then obtain @xmath255 from ( [ f - sum ] ) . with one more application of the sum formula we can obtain the corresponding generating function for curves of each genus @xmath307 in @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation done in section 5 is very encouraging : we successfully used symplectic gluing methods determine gw invariants in an interesting case , and the result automatically appeared in the elegant form ( [ e : main ] ) .",
    "moreover , the result correctly enumerates curves in a case  rational curves in the classes @xmath236 in @xmath7  of interest to algebraic geometers .",
    "obviously , one would like to extend this approach and develop it into a general method for calculating gw invariants for whole classes of symplectic manifolds .",
    "one can further hope to relate those gw invariants to enumerative invariants of khler surfaces .",
    "this idea is especially appealing because it seems to be linked to some remarkable conjectures in enumerative algebraic geometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these arose from the observation that in the cases where enumerative invariants have been proved or conjectured ( some by algebraic geometers and some by string theorists ) , the generating functions are remarkably similar .",
    "they are always products of a few special functions .",
    "two of those special functions , namely @xmath254 in ( [ e : main ] ) and @xmath308 in ( [ g(t ) ] ) , arose naturally in gluing computations of the previous section .",
    "thus it is reasonable to conjecture that there are similar universal formulas for the gw invariants of khler surfaces .",
    "but there is a catch .",
    "this vision of simple , calculable and non - trivial gw generating functions is not true for the usual gromov - witten invariants .",
    "in fact , for khler surfaces with geometric genus @xmath0 _ all of the gw invariants of interest vanish_. this phenomenon has a simple explanation , which we describe in this section .",
    "the discussion here is preparation for introducing the `` family gw invariants '' in the next section .",
    "recall that the geometric genus @xmath16 of a khler surface is the ( complex ) dimension of the space @xmath12 of holomorphic ( 0,2)-forms . the role of @xmath16 can already be seen in the following example , which involves the elliptic surface @xmath19 obtained as the @xmath207-fold fiber sum of copies of @xmath7 as shown in figure 7 .    ]",
    "let @xmath309 be an elliptic surface with a section of self - intersection number @xmath310 .",
    "this is a simply - connected khler manifold with a fiber class @xmath228 and a section class @xmath214 satisfying @xmath311 . using the adjunction formula and riemann - roch",
    ", one sees that the canonical class is @xmath312 and the geometric genus is @xmath313 .",
    "then by ( [ 1.dim ] ) the dimension of the gw moduli space for the class @xmath236 with genus @xmath119 and no marked points is @xmath314 this is negative when @xmath315 , meaning that the moduli space is empty for generic @xmath2 .",
    "thus the genus @xmath316 gw - invariants for the class @xmath236 are all zero .    more generally , in a khler surface @xmath1 , the space of holomorphic curves representing a fixed homology class @xmath68 forms a space called the ( generalied ) severi variety ( see @xcite ) .",
    "when the severi variety has dimension @xmath207 , one can impose @xmath207 point constraints by introducing marked points @xmath317 on the domain and @xmath207 points @xmath318 in @xmath1 and restricting attention to the set of maps @xmath14 with @xmath319 for @xmath320 . when certain tranversality conditions are met , that will be a finite set of maps , and count of those maps is an enumerative invariant of @xmath1 .",
    "however , when @xmath0 that enumerative invariant is not a gw invariant .",
    "the reason is that the ( formal ) dimension of the gw moduli space is strictly less than the dimension of the severi variety .",
    "here is a specific computation .",
    "[ ex6.1 ] let @xmath1 be a khler surface with canonical class @xmath50 .",

    "then the space @xmath322 of curves representing @xmath68 has complex dimension @xmath323 where @xmath324 is the dimension ( [ 1.dim ] ) of the gw moduli space of maps representing @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath325 the line bundle over @xmath1 corresponding to the divisor @xmath326 and let @xmath327 be the normal bundle . fixing a section with divisor @xmath326 gives a sheaf exact sequence @xmath328 , which induces the long exact sequence @xmath329 but since @xmath321 is ample , it follows from serre duality and kodaira vanishing theorem that @xmath330 and @xmath331 both vanish .",
    "thus @xmath332 has complex dimension @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the tangent space to @xmath322 is the space @xmath333 of holomorphic deformations of @xmath326 .",
    "finally , by riemann - roch and ( [ 1.dim ] ) @xmath334    the situation in example [ ex6.1 ] is built into the algebraic geometry viewpoint of gromov - witten invariants . ignoring technical difficulties ,",
    "the picture is as follows . on a khler surface ,",
    "the space of stable maps @xmath56 ( which is the severi variety when the maps are embeddings ) is a compact projective variety of some dimension @xmath207 .",
    "there is a rank @xmath16 bundle @xmath335 over that space @xmath336 whose fiber over a map @xmath14 is @xmath337 .",

    "algebraic geometers define gw invariants using this in place of the space ( [ 1.mstable ] ) of perturbed holomorphic maps .    to relate this picture to the geometric analysis viewpoint , consider a perturbation @xmath45 as in ( [ 1.pertholomorphicmapeq ] ) .",
    "at each map @xmath14 , the linearization of the @xmath2-holomorphic map equation is an operator @xmath339 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the zeros of that section are exactly the @xmath2-holomorphic maps @xmath14 that , by the implicit function theorem , can be uniquely corrected to solutions of the perturbed holomorphic map equation @xmath342 for small fixed @xmath343 . that zero set thus represents the virtual moduli cycle ( [ 6.vmc ] ) and is homologous to the moduli space ( [ 1.mstable ] ) defined by the perturbed equations .",
    "the distinction between the gw and the enumerative counts should now be clear .",

    "here we will focus on the analytic approach of the first author .",
    "that is described in the next section .",
    "this section describes the first author s family gw invariants for khler surfaces .",
    "these are based on the observation that , associated to each khler structure @xmath2 , there is a 2@xmath346-dimensional family of almost complex structures , very naturally parameterized by @xmath12 . while this parameter space is non - compact",

    "@xmath74 , we then have a 2@xmath16 dimensional family of elements @xmath354 in @xmath355 .",
    "we modify the @xmath2-holomorphic map equation ( 1 ) by considering the pairs @xmath13 satisfying @xmath356    we can recast this as a family of pseudo - holomorphic maps parameterized by @xmath357 .",
    "the above definitions imply that @xmath358 is injective , and hence invertible , for each @xmath359 .",

    "then , following the standard procedure described in section 1 , we can pushforward by the evaluation and obtain symplectic invariants _ provided the modui space is compact_.    compactness is an issue because the parameter @xmath18 , which ranges over the vector space @xmath367 , may be unbounded .",
    "nevertheless , one can use specific geometric arguments to show that the moduli space _ is _ compact for many classes @xmath68 , and consequently the invariants are well - defined for those classes . in @xcite , we proved that is true for many cases important in algebraic geometry .",

    "in fact , we have just described that proof : equations ( [ bl ] ) and ( [ c - e(n ) ] ) directly imply ( [ yz ] ) for primitive classes in @xmath443 .",
    "the key point is that for primitive classes the count of holomorphic _ maps _ , given by the family gw invariants , is the same as the count of holomorphic _ curves _ , which are counted by the numbers @xmath444 .",
    "verifying the yau - zaslow conjecture for multiple classes has turned out to be much harder .",
    "any approach must deal with the fact that the counts of curves and maps are no longer the same because maps can multiply cover their images . using algebraic geometry , a. gathmann @xcite worked out some special cases by hand , and jun li @xcite outlined an approach .",
    "very recently , the first author and n.c .",
    "leung have extended the approach of the previous section to prove the yau - zaslow formula ( [ yz ] ) for classes that are _ twice _ a primitive class .",
    "we will explain that result in this section .",
    "the key theorem is the following .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is a k3 surface and @xmath445 is twice a primitive class .",
    "then the genus @xmath119 family gw - invariant of @xmath1 for the class @xmath68 is given by @xmath446 where @xmath370 is any primitive class with @xmath447 .",
    "this theorem implies the yau - zaslow formula ( [ yz ] ) for the classes that are twice a primitive class by the following reasoning .",
    "first , since we already know the yau - zaslow conjecture for primitive classes , the invariant @xmath448 equals to @xmath449 where @xmath290 is defined by @xmath450 .",
    "similarly , since @xmath451 is a primitive class , the number of curves representing @xmath451 is @xmath452 where @xmath453 . as explained by gathmann @xcite ,",
    "the double covers of those @xmath451-curves contribute @xmath454 to the invariant @xmath455 .",
    "thus ( [ 10.2 ] ) is equivalent to the fact that the count of ( reduced ) rational curves representing the classes @xmath68 and @xmath370 are the same  both are the number given by formula ( [ yz ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath241 is odd both classes @xmath460 and @xmath461 are primitive with the same square and hence by ( [ bl ] ) all odd terms in the left hand side of ( [ main-1 ] ) vanish .",
    "thus is suffices to show ( [ main-1 ] ) . that requires several steps .",
    "we first derive a relation among the family invariants for the classes @xmath460 , @xmath248 .",
    "fix a smooth fiber @xmath162 of @xmath462 and let @xmath463 denote the genus 1 relative family invariants of @xmath464 and with multiplicity vector ( 2 ) .",
    "this is a count of stable @xmath11-holomorphic maps @xmath14 from an elliptic curve with one marked point @xmath153 so that @xmath14 contacts @xmath162 at @xmath163 with multiplicity two and whose image has no components in @xmath162 .",
    "introduce generating functions @xmath465 the genus 1 trr formula combined with splitting formulas gives @xmath466 while the sum formula for the symplectic sum @xmath467 yields @xmath468 and @xmath469 where @xmath470 is the eisenstein series with weight 2 , namely @xmath471 ( the coefficients of ( [ es1 ] ) and ( [ es2 ] ) consist of relative invariants of @xmath283 that can be computed by several applications of genus 0 and 1 trr formulas and the sum formula for the fiber sum @xmath472 ) .",
    "together , equations ( [ et ] ) , ( [ es1 ] ) , and ( [ es2 ] ) give @xmath473    we can repeat this argument to get a relation of invariants for the primitive classes @xmath461 . note that we can always find an embedded symplectic submanifold @xmath474 of @xmath437 that represents @xmath475 : take a map from an elliptic curve that double covers a fiber and perturb slightly ; the perturbed map will remain symplectic , and will be an embedding by the adjunction formula since @xmath476 .",
    "fix such a @xmath474 and write @xmath477 for the genus 1 relative invariants of @xmath437 relative to @xmath474 and multiplicity vector ( 2 ) .",
    "we can then build two more generating functions : @xmath478 for these , the genus @xmath479 trr formula gives a formula like ( [ et ] ) and the sum formula for the symplectic sum @xmath480 gives formulas like ( [ es1 ] ) and ( [ es2 ] ) ; together those give @xmath481 note that ( [ ode-1 ] ) and ( [ ode-2 ] ) have the same coefficients ; that is true because all coefficients in the trr and the sum formulas depend only on the topological quantities @xmath482 hence ( [ ode-1 ] ) and ( [ ode-2 ] ) give @xmath483      - 6\\big[m_{1}\\big(pt\\big ) -   p_{1}\\big(pt\\big)\\big ] \\\\      \\ , = \\ , 20 g_{2}t\\,\\big[m_{0 } - p_{0}\\,\\big]^{\\prime } -      \\left(192g_{2}^{2 } + 40g_{2 } -   24t\\,g_{2}^{\\prime}\\right )      \\big[m_{0 } - p_{0}\\big ]       \\label{ode-3}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    next observe that because @xmath460 and @xmath461 are primitive classes with the same square when @xmath241 is odd , it follows from ( [ bl ] ) that the generating functions @xmath484 and @xmath485 have no odd terms .",
    "one can also show that @xmath486 has no odd terms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , comparing odd terms in both sides of ( [ ode-3 ] ) gives the first order ode @xmath487 where @xmath488 ( resp .",
    "@xmath489 ) is the sum of all even ( resp .",
    "odd ) terms of @xmath470 .",
    "the initial condition of this ode is given by the well - known multiple map contribution @xcite @xmath490    on the other hand , it follows from the differential equation ( [ s9-ode ] ) that @xmath491 using this , one can check that @xmath492 satisfies the same ode ( [ ode-4 ] ) if @xmath493 under the substitution @xmath494 the left hand side of ( [ rel - qmod ] ) is a modular form of level 2 with weight 4 and the space of those modular forms is a 2 dimensional vector space with well - known bases @xcite .",
    "thus , one can prove ( [ rel - qmod ] ) by showing the first two terms in the expansion of the left hand side of ( [ rel - qmod ] ) vanish . using the initial condition @xmath435",
    ", we can thus conclude that @xmath495 by the definition of @xmath496 and @xmath497 , this is exactly the desired formula ( [ main-1 ] )",
    ".    it would be interesting to extend this approach to higher multiple classes .",
    "unfortunately that is not straightforward . in the above calculation",
    ", the right - hand side of the sum formula ( [ es2 ] ) fortuitously contains only genus 0 and 1 invariants of @xmath437 .",
    "that is a consequence of the vanishing of the genus 0 relative invariants of @xmath283 constrained to contact three copies of @xmath228 to order 2 .",
    "that vanishing does not occur for the classes @xmath498 with @xmath499 .",
    "that leads to additional terms in ( [ es2 ] ) for higher multiple classes , and dealing with those terms seems to require new ideas .",

    "<S> the number of such maps is finite . that number is a gw invariant of the symplectic manifold @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first part of this article focuses on cut - and - paste methods for computing gw invariants of symplectic four - manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> two useful techniques are described in sections 24 . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the method of `` splitting the domain '' , in which one considers maps whose domains are pinched riemann surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this produces recursion relations , called trr formulas , relating one gw invariant to invariants whose images have smaller area or lower genus .    </S>",
    "<S> one can also consider the behavior of gw invariants as one `` splits the target '' using the symplectic cut operation and its inverse , the symplectic sum . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting `` symplectic sum formula '' of e. ionel and the second author expresses the gw invariants of the symplectic sum of two manifolds @xmath1 and @xmath6 in terms of the relative gw invariants of @xmath1 and @xmath6 as described in section 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> these splitting formulas for the domain and the target can sometimes be combined to completely determine a set of gw invariants . </S>",
    "<S> one such computation is given in section 5 . </S>",
    "<S> there we use a clever geometric argument of e. ionel to derive an explicit formula for certain gw invariants of the rational elliptic surface @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> that formula , explained in section 5 , is @xmath8    there is strong motivation for generalizing this @xmath7 computation . </S>",
    "<S> we would , of course , like to make such cut - and - paste arguments into a systematic way of computing invariants of whole classes of 4-manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> more alluring yet is the connection with enumerative algebraic geometry . </S>",
    "<S> there is a series of conjectures , originally coming from string theory , that claim that the generating functions of counts of holomorphic curves in algebraic surfaces are given by certain specific formulas ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest such formula is exactly ( [ introformula1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the next simplest is the yau - zaslow conjecture for rational curves in k3 surfaces ( @xcite ) .    in seeking to generalize the @xmath7 computation , </S>",
    "<S> one encounters a serious problem . for @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the gw invariants are the same as the curve counts of enumerative geometry . but for most other complex surfaces , beginning with @xmath9 , the conjectural formulas count curves in classes for which the gromov - witten invariants vanish !    this discrepancy occurs because gw invariants are defined using generic almost complex structures @xmath2 , while khler structures are very special . </S>",
    "<S> entire families of curves can disappear when the khler @xmath2 is perturbed to a generic @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , algebraic k3 surfaces contain many holomorphic curves , as predicted by the yau - zaslow conjecture , but a generic @xmath9 surface has no holomorphic curves at all ! in general , given a space ( generalized severi variety ) of curves in a khler manifold , one can perturb to a generic almost complex structure @xmath2 and ask which curves in the severi variety perturb to become @xmath2-holomorphic curves . </S>",
    "<S> this problem fits into standard deformation theory , as explained in section 6 , and from that perspective one sees that there is an obstruction bundle over the severi variety whose rank is the geometric genus @xmath10 of the surface @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus when @xmath0 the space of curves and the gw moduli space have different dimensions , and consequently the gw invariants are unrelated to the enumerative counts of algebraic geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> sections 710 describe the first author s geometric analysis method for overcoming this problem . </S>",
    "<S> the key observation is that on each khler manifold there is a very natural family of almost complex structures @xmath11 parameterized by @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> one can then consider pairs @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a @xmath11-holomorphic map for some @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> such pairs form a moduli space whose dimension is @xmath16 greater than the standard gw moduli space . </S>",
    "<S> the family gw invariants are defined from that moduli space using the constructions of li - tian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( bryan - leung and behrend - fantechi , have alternative approaches which use algebraic geometry ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the family moduli space has a remarkable property : whenever @xmath2 is khler , all @xmath11-holomorphic maps in fact have @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the family invariants , which are generally counts of @xmath11-holomorphic maps , reduce to counts of true holomorphic maps in the khler surface . </S>",
    "<S> a less pleasing aspect is that the moduli space may not be compact , since @xmath18 ranges over the vector space @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> however , results in @xcite show that it is compact in many cases of interest , and for those cases the family invariants are well - defined symplectic invariants that are closely related to enumerative counts .    </S>",
    "<S> the next task is to extend the cut - and - paste formulas to the family gw invariants . in sections 8 and 9 </S>",
    "<S> we develop trr and symplectic sum formulas for the family gw invariants , following @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> those formulas immediately allow us to extend the @xmath7 calculation of section 5 to the elliptic surfaces @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a simple expression for the family gw invariants which generalizes ( [ introformula1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the final section describes the very recent work of the first author and n.c . </S>",
    "<S> leung on the yau - zaslow conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> the conjecture predicts a specific formula  a slight modification of ( [ introformula1 ] )  for the generating function of the counts of rational curves in k3 surfaces . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> bryan and leung proved the conjecture in the cases when the curves represent primitive homology classes . </S>",
    "<S> sections 9 and 10 describe an independent proof of that fact and its extension to classes that are twice a primitive class . </S>",
    "<S> the proofs repeatedly use the symplectic cut - and - paste techniques developed in earlier sections . </S>"
