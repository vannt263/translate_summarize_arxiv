    "<S> most of the attention has been focused on the minimal version of supersymmetry ( mssm ) , however , many other incarnations of supersymmetry could exist . in most cases </S>",
    "<S> these non - minimal models can significantly alter supersymmetric phenomenology and the associated search strategies , and hence all consequences of such models must be examined before regions of supersymmetric parameter space can be positively excluded . here </S>",
    "<S> , we examine one such non - minimal case : the light gluino scenario . in some models </S>",
    "<S> it is natural@xcite for gluinos to be much lighter than , , squarks if they acquire their masses radiatively . </S>",
    "<S> while several experiments presently cast doubt on the existence of the low mass gluino window ( @xmath7 gev ) , it has yet to be conclusively ruled out ( or verified ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the experimental bounds on this possibility are surprisingly spotty and controversial as evidenced by the continual debate in the literature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus imperative to examine all implications of this hypothesis in order to quell this dispute . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate an additional data sample which provides strong constraints on the light gluino scenario , namely @xmath0 processes at high energy hadron colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> the window for a very light gluino was pointed out@xcite many years ago and its effects have since been analyzed in a variety of processes . </S>",
    "<S> a resurgence of interest in this scenario surfaced with the relatively recent observation@xcite that an apparent discrepancy between the value of @xmath8 measured from jet production at sld and lep and that discerned from low energy data is resolved by the slower running of @xmath8 in the presence of light gluinos . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent compilations@xcite of various determinations of @xmath8 no longer show evidence of such a discrepancy , within the errors , but also claim that the precision of each individual measurement is such that any anomalous effect up to the @xmath9 level may not be perceived </S>",
    "<S> . the most noticeable consequence of this model is that the standard signals for gluino and squark production are modified in the presence of light gluinos . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds on the gluino mass , @xmath10 gev from the tevatron@xcite ( with the range being due to the assumed relative sizes of the squark and gluino masses ) , are invalidated in this case as they depend on the fact that the  is short - lived and decays with the characteristic missing energy signature . thus to be light , gluinos must be long - lived and appear to hadronize as jets . since they are unable to appear as free particles , light gluinos will indeed form hadrons , with the bound states having longer lifetimes , and fragment in such a way as to mimic jets in a high energy detector@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if kinematically allowed , the gluino hadrons will eventually decay into a final state containing jets @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lightest neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial ingredient for detection is then the ability of the final state @xmath12 to pass the detector s missing energy cuts , which depends , amongst other things , on how the  hadron fragments . </S>",
    "<S> it has been estimated@xcite that for @xmath13 gev the  would have been detected at ua1 . however , as the gluino mass decreases , the missing energy signal disappears altogether . </S>",
    "<S> standard squark searches are also nullified in this model as now the primary decay is @xmath14 , which again , escapes searches based on missing energy . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the squark mass bounds are reduced to @xmath15 , with the mass constraint being extended to @xmath16 gev from precision electroweak measurements at slc / lep@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect lep ii to strengthen the squark mass bound to @xmath17 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the results from a variety of light gluino searches . at present , </S>",
    "<S> the least controversial bound on light gluinos is from a search by cusb@xcite for radiative @xmath18 decays into bound states of gluinos . </S>",
    "<S> they exclude the mass range @xmath19 gev ( regardless of the gluino lifetime ) , where the lower limit is approximate due to questions@xcite concerning the validity of perturbative qcd in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> argus@xcite looked for secondary vertices from @xmath20 with subsequent decay of the gluino bound states and constrained a small region in the gluino mass - lifetime parameter space ; these results , however , also suffer@xcite from perturbative qcd uncertainties as well as those from fragmentation effects . </S>",
    "<S> beam dump experiments@xcite have looked for secondary vertices from the decay of  hadrons and appear to disfavor light gluinos for restricted regions of the gluino lifetime , but these results depend on ( i ) assumptions on the production cross sections of the gluino hadrons , ( ii ) the value of the squark mass ( iii ) the interactions of the lightest color - singlet supersymmetric particle , @xmath12 , with the detector , and ( iv )   fragmentation effects and decay models . </S>",
    "<S> searches for new neutral particles at fermilab exclude@xcite @xmath21 gev for  lifetimes in excess of @xmath22 s. jet angular distributions of decays of the @xmath23 into four jets and precision measurements of the qcd structure constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 have been shown to be particularly sensitive to the existence of light gluinos@xcite , but critically depend@xcite on currently uncalculated higher order qcd corrections and hence no firm conclusions can presently be drawn . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 boson can decay into 2 gluinos , however the branching fraction is small@xcite ( @xmath26 ) , and would be hidden underneath ordinary qcd events . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of light gluinos at hera , through their effect on deep inelastic structure functions@xcite or via their production in the @xmath27 jet photoproduction cross section@xcite , have also been shown to be difficult .    in this study , we examine the effects of light , long - lived gluinos on dijet production in hadronic collisions . </S>",
    "<S> one would expect the influence of light s to be large in such processes since they contribute at leading order in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown@xcite , however , that competing effects tend to suppress their impact on the single jet inclusive @xmath28 spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we find that the influence of resonant squark production from the subprocess @xmath1 should not be neglected as it greatly modifies the dijet mass spectrum and places strong constraints on the light gluino window . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions avoid some of the aforementioned difficulties in constraining this scenario , as non - perturbative qcd effects are negligible at the energies considered here and our results are insensitive to a long  lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> the essential ingredients of this model for our analysis are ( i ) the evolution of @xmath8 is modified by the inclusion of light gluinos in the qcd @xmath29 function , ( ii ) long - lived gluinos in the final state hadronize as jets , and ( iii ) light gluinos contribute a non - negligible partonic content of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces several new @xmath0 parton scattering processes , as well as modifying the altarelli - parisi evolution of the parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> global fits of structure functions which include a light gluino distribution have been performed@xcite , and it has been found that the nlo   parton distributions are roughly three ( five ) times larger than that of the strange quark at large ( small ) @xmath30 for very light gluinos , @xmath31 gev , and carry @xmath9 of the proton s momentum fraction at large @xmath32 for @xmath33 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed with our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> all @xmath0 subprocesses have been evaluated ; they naturally fall into three categories , ( i ) those of the sm , @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 ,  @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , ( ii ) all sm initiated @xmath0 processes with final state gluinos , @xmath38 , and ( iii ) all gluino initiated processes , @xmath39 ,  @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> note that resonant squark production appears in the latter set . </S>",
    "<S> higher order @xmath42 processes , including the new reactions@xcite which produce @xmath43jet and thus yield 3 jet final states once the squark decays , have not been included . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the light gluino has also been neglected in the evaluation of the subprocess cross sections as the results should not be sensitive to  at the energy scales considered here . </S>",
    "<S> the parton distributions@xcite of r \" uckl and vogt have been used for @xmath44 gev and those of roberts and stirling for @xmath33 gev . </S>",
    "<S> these values of the gluino mass avoid all of the experimental constraints detailed above . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the evolution of @xmath8 has been taken into account by fixing @xmath45 to the world average value@xcite and then running it to the relevant scale using the appropriate 2-loop @xmath29 functions . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the 3-loop light  @xmath29 functions have only recently been determined@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in evaluating the squark resonance contribution to the cross section , we have used the narrow width approximation , which is valid for @xmath46 and hence is reliable in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we have included a 10% contribution to the squark width for potential non - dijet decays , , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this is conservative as dijet decays will be by far the dominant mode . </S>",
    "<S> the 10% figure should cover the additional weak decays @xmath48 and @xmath49 , whichever are kinematically allowed , as they are expected to have small branching fractions of order @xmath50 each and hence are suppressed compared to the dijet mode . </S>",
    "<S> we note that monojet signals from squark production in this scenario have been previously analyzed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also assumed that there are 5 degenerate squarks , with equal masses for the left- and right - handed states . </S>",
    "<S> our results are not dependent on this assumption , however , as the contribution of each squark flavor to the resonance peak is weighted by the corresponding quark s parton density </S>",
    "<S> . hence this supposition does not simply result in an overall multiplicative factor to the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the charm and bottom squarks have essentially negligible contributions to the resonance peak .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the dijet system consists of the two jets with the highest transverse momentum in the event . in all cases , except where noted , we apply the cuts used by the cdf collaboration@xcite in their dijet analyses . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to @xmath51 gev , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the pseudorapidities of the two leading jets , and @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being the parton - parton scattering angle in the center of mass frame . </S>",
    "<S> following cdf , we evaluate these processes at the scale @xmath56 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we display the dijet invariant mass and single jet inclusive @xmath57 distributions for the cases of @xmath58 and 500 gev , taking @xmath59 and 5 gev corresponding to the dotted , dashed , and solid curves , respectively . in the case of the @xmath57 distributions , </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and no angular cuts are applied . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the resonance peaks stand out for all values of the gluino mass . </S>",
    "<S> note the degradation of the cross section as the  mass increases .    </S>",
    "<S> we now evaluate the dijet resonance cross section and compare it to searches for dijet mass peaks from the single production of new particles performed by hadron collider experiments@xcite . figure 2 </S>",
    "<S> presents the single squark production cross section in the dijet channel as a function of the squark mass for various values of . </S>",
    "<S> also displayed in the figure ( dotted curve ) is the upper limit on the production of dijet resonances at ( a ) ua2@xcite at @xmath62 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> , as well as both ( b ) cdf@xcite and ( c ) d0@xcite at the @xmath63 c.l . in the d0 case </S>",
    "<S> the applied cuts are somewhat different than those employed by cdf : @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the three experiments combine to exclude substantial regions of the light gluino parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the ranges of the squark masses which are ruled out for each value of   are summarized in table [ bumptab ] . </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect the bounds to drastically improve as @xmath66 as the squark resonance cross section is not appreciably changing as the gluino mass decreases ( once @xmath31 gev ) as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> a short analysis shows that the cross section for massless gluinos is approximately 1.3(1.6 ) times larger than that for the case of @xmath67 gev at low(high ) dijet invariant masses .    </S>",
    "<S> .the squark mass regions in gev excluded by the searches for dijet resonances by the ua2 ( at @xmath62 c.l . ) , cdf and d0 ( at @xmath63 c.l . ) </S>",
    "<S> collaborations for an assumed gluino mass . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     dijet angular distributions are a well known test of qcd and probe of new physics and have recently been measured at the tevatron@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ordinary qcd processes have large @xmath68- and @xmath69-channel poles and are thus peaked in the forward direction , whereas , resonant squark production in the light gluino model will have a flat distribution due to the spin-0 nature of the squark . a convenient angular variable to use </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath70 . for the case of @xmath0 parton scattering , this is related to the center of mass scattering angle as @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 then corresponds to @xmath73 . as is well - known@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the @xmath74 variable is that it removes the apparent singularities associated with the @xmath75 and @xmath76channel poles present in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath77 shows greater sensitivity to new physics which does not possess such poles than does @xmath78 . to show the influence of the production of squark resonances on this distribution we display in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 the ratio of @xmath77 calculated in the light gluino model to that of the sm , , @xmath79 , for three dijet invariant mass bins ( as chosen by cdf@xcite ) assuming a  resonance lies within each bin . in calculating the sm distributions , we employed the mrsa@xmath80 parton densities@xcite . in all cases , we see that squark production leads to an enhancement in the distribution at low values of @xmath74 compared to the sm . this would result in an increase in the dijet rate near @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the corresponding figures presented by cdf@xcite shows that this rise in @xmath77 would be easily observable so that squarks with the masses chosen here could be excluded .    </S>",
    "<S> we now make this procedure more rigorous in order to determine if the angular distributions can extend the excluded regions listed in table [ bumptab ] . following the procedure used by cdf@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the variable @xmath82 , which is the ratio of the number of dijet events in the two ranges of @xmath74 , for the five mass bins @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this variable has the advantages that it is not very sensitive to variations in the parton densities , to the choice of renormalization scale ( , @xmath56 versus @xmath88 ) , or to next - to - leading order qcd corrections , and that it characterizes the shape of the angular distribution in a mass bin with a single number . </S>",
    "<S> we have incorporated the systematic errors , as determined by cdf , as well as the statistical errors in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic errors are highly correlated , and we have reconstructed the full covariance matrix according to the prescription in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate @xmath89 in each @xmath88 bin with @xmath59 and 5 gev for squark masses in the range @xmath90 gev , and perform a fit to the cdf results using their data and correlation matrix . following the usual @xmath91 analysis procedure , </S>",
    "<S> we find the minimum value of @xmath91 for a given value of   and then determine the excluded range of  by examining the @xmath91 distribution as a function of the squark mass . </S>",
    "<S> for definiteness we perform a lo calculation taking the scale @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are presented in fig . 4 for each assumed value of the gluino mass . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath91 minima are generally found in the limit of very large squark masses . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath91 distributions display a similar shape with 5 peaks which are associated with the 5 mass bins used by cdf and are due to the fact that the greatest sensitivity to a squark resonance occurs when it coincides in mass with the lower end of a given bin , , when the squark cross section is maximum . to be more specific , when  is light ( @xmath93 gev ) and outside the dijet mass region examined by cdf , the @xmath91 is small but increases as the squark mass gets closer to the edge of lowest mass bin and then peaks once the bin is entered . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity then decreases as approaches the high end of the mass bin . </S>",
    "<S> as the value of  rises there is a general loss in sensitivity due to decrease in statistics and the corresponding increase in the size of the errors .    </S>",
    "<S> this analysis excludes at the @xmath63 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> the  ranges @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 gev for = 0.4 , 1.3 , and 5 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it thus both extends and complements the constraints obtained from the dijet peak searches . here </S>",
    "<S> , we might expect improvements on these constraints for @xmath66 due to the increased enhancement in @xmath97 at @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> combining these results with the bounds from the resonance searches excludes squark masses in the range @xmath2 gev for gluino masses of @xmath3 gev .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have examined the constraints on models with light gluinos by using both the cross section and angular distribution for dijet events observed at hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> the critical observation is that a light gluino can act as a partonic component of the proton thus leading to the resonant production @xmath1 , provided the  is sufficiently light . from our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , it would appear that the survival of the light gluino case requires either a light  in the @xmath99 gev range , or a heavy  with @xmath100 gev . from studies of the physics capabilities at run ii of the tevatron@xcite , we anticipate that this future data will be able to exclude or verify this model for squark masses up to @xmath4 tev . </S>",
    "<S> high energy hadron colliders may thus provide the best testing ground for this scenario . </S>"
