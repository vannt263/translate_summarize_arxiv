    "we observed n49 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board _ chandra x - ray observatory _ on 2009 july 18  september 19 ( obsids 10123 , 10806 , 10807 , and 10808 ) during ao10 .",
    "we chose the acis - s3 chip to utilize the best sensitivity and energy resolution of the detector in the soft x - ray band .",

    "sgr 052666 and the ejecta bullet candidate are detected within @xmath930@xmath28 and @xmath940@xmath28 of the aim point , respectively .",
    "we used a 1/4 subarray of the acis - s3 to ensure low photon pileup ( @xmath29 5% ) of sgr 052666 , and to allow us to detect the 8 s pulsations from the sgr , while still obtaining full coverage of the entire snr n49 .",
    "we processed the raw event files following the standard data reduction methods using ciao 4.2 and _ chandra _ caldb 4.3.0 , which includes correction for the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) .",
    "we applied the standard data screening by status and grade ( _ asca _ grades 02346 ) .",
    "we performed this data reduction on individual observations .",
    "the overall light curve from the entire s3 chip for each obsid showed no evidence of flaring particle background .",
    "then , we merged four data sets into a single event file by re - projecting them onto obsid 10807 s tangential plane .",
    "after the data reduction , the total effective exposure is @xmath9108 ks .",
    "we also used two data sets ( obsids 747 and 1957 ) available in the _ chandra _ archive6@xmath175 , obsid 1041 ) and a short exposure ( @xmath97 ks , obsid 2515 ) . ] .",
    "the pointing of these archival data was toward the position of sgr 052666 ( @xmath18@xmath19 = 05@xmath20 26@xmath21 00@xmath22.7 , @xmath23@xmath19 = @xmath2466@xmath25 04@xmath26 35@xmath270 ) , and thus they provide a high resolution imaging of n49 as well as the sgr . although these archival data can not be used to study south - southwestern regions ( including the ejecta bullet candidate ) of n49 due to the use of 1/8 subarray of the acis - s3 , they covered east - northeastern parts of the snr with a decent exposure ( a total of @xmath988 ks by combining obsids 747 and 1957 ) .",
    "thus , these data are useful to study eastern regions of n49 and sgr 052666 .",
    "we re - processed these two archival data sets in the same way as we did for our new observation data . combining all these observations , our data present the deepest coverage with the high resolution x - ray imaging spectroscopy for snr n49 ( @xmath9108 ks in the south - west regions and @xmath9196 ks in the north - east regions ) and sgr 052666 ( @xmath9196 ks ) .",

    "an x - ray color image of n49 shows complex asymmetric x - ray emission features ( figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "these features have been partially revealed by previous _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "our new deep _",
    "image reveals all those fine x - ray structures throughout the entire snr with substantially improved photon statistics and resolution ( figure  [ fig : fig1]a )",
    ". the outer boundary of n49 appears as a thin shell radiating in soft x - rays ( reddish in figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) that represents the blast wave sweeping through the general ambient medium of the lmc .",
    "a notable exception is the candidate ejecta bullet extending beyond the snr shell in the southwest , which is distinctively blue in color ( figure  [ fig : fig1]c ) .",
    "bright x - ray filaments in the eastern parts of the snr are regions where the shock is interacting with dense clumpy clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these shock - cloud interaction regions show a wide range in x - ray colors at angular scales down to several arcseconds .",
    "the western parts of n49 are relatively faint and x - ray emission is emphasized in green to blue while showing some red filamentary features as well ( figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "this general color variation across the snr appears to be related to the temperature variation caused by the overall interstellar density distribution , in which dense clouds are interacting with the shock mostly in the eastern half of the snr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spectrally - hard , blue protrusion extending beyond the main snr shell in the southwestern boundary was proposed to be a candidate ejecta bullet based on the previous low - resolution _ chandra _ data @xcite . if it is indeed an ejecta bullet , this feature is reminiscent of `` shrapnel '' found in the vela snr @xcite , but nearly two orders of magnitude more distant .",
    "data clearly resolve this feature .",
    "it is an extended feature with a head ( @xmath94@xmath28 in radius ) and a tail that connects the head to the main snr shell ( the `` head '' and `` tail '' regions in figure  [ fig : fig1]a , respectively ) .",
    "the blue color of the head region is likely due to enhanced line emission in the hard x - ray band : e.g. , the si ( he@xmath18 + ly@xmath18 ) line _ equivalent width _ ( ew ) map shows a strong enhancement in the head region ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a ) , which suggests a metal - rich ejecta for the origin of this feature .",
    "in fact , our spectral analysis of the head region shows highly overabundant si and s ( see section  [ subsubsec : ejecta ] ) .",
    "the tail region appears to be composed of a central hard ( blue ) emission region surrounded by a soft ( red ) , conical region ( figure  [ fig : fig1]c ) .",
    "it is likely the turbulent region behind the bullet , in which the metal - rich ejecta and shocked ism are intermixed , possibly enclosed by the sides of a bow - shock produced by the bullet s supersonic motion . the bow shock , however , is not prominent ahead of the bullet , possibly due to unfavorable viewing geometry .",
    "the axis bisecting the opening angle ( @xmath987@xmath25 ) is roughly pointing back to the geometric center of the snr , but not exactly toward sgr 052666 .",
    "we noticed that there is a small region in the eastern part of the snr ( the `` east '' region in figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) , which shows similar characteristics to those of the head region : i.e. , this region stands out with a distinctively blue color in the bright eastern half of the snr , and it is coincident with a strongly enhanced si line ew ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a ) .",
    "the east region corresponds to an inter - cloud region ( figure  [ fig : fig2]b ) in which a possibility of metal overabundance was suggested by our previous work @xcite .",
    "our spectral analysis of this region indeed reveals its metal - rich ejecta nature ( see section  [ subsubsec : ejecta ] ) .",
    "based on results from our image analysis , we extracted spectra from several regions that appear to characteristically represent distinctive features : i.e. , the swept - up interstellar medium ( the `` shell '' and `` sgr_bg '' regions ) , shocked metal - rich ejecta ( the `` head '' and `` east '' regions ) , and the connecting region between the ejecta bullet and the main snr shell ( the `` tail '' region ) .",
    "these regions are marked in figures  [ fig : fig1]a & [ fig : fig1]b .",
    "we also extracted the spectrum from the quiescent x - ray counterpart of sgr 052666 ( the `` sgr '' region in figure  [ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "we present the spectral analysis of these swept - up medium , ejecta features , and 052666 in sections  [ subsubsec : ism ] , [ subsubsec : ejecta ] , and [ subsubsec : sgr ] , respectively .",
    "the brightest x - ray emission in the eastern parts of n49 originates from the shock interaction with clumpy clouds with a density gradient spanning a few orders of magnitudes @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from such a clumpy medium would represent a complex mixture of gas temperatures and ionization states .",
    "such a plasma condition is likely localized in strong shock - cloud interaction regions .",
    "while the western regions do not show evidence of shock interaction with dense clumpy clouds , they also show some significant x - ray color variation ( figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) . for those regions , it is not straightforward to characterize the x - ray emission spectrum of the general ambient medium shocked by the blast wave .",
    "thus , to study the nature of the general swept - up ism and the snr s overall dynamics , we extracted the x - ray spectrum from a region in the outermost rim of the snr in the southern boundary ( the `` shell '' region in figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) in which no complex spectral and/or spatial substructures are seen .",
    "we also used a small annular region surrounding sgr 052666 ( the `` sgr_bg '' region in figure  [ fig : fig1]b ) to characterize background emission for sgr 052666 . since the sgr_bg region is in the _ transition _ area between the bright eastern and faint western parts of the snr",
    ", it may also effectively show an average plasma condition of the complex shock structures across the snr .",
    "for our spectral analysis , we re - binned the observed spectra to contain a minimum of 20 counts per energy channel .",
    "we fit the x - ray spectrum with a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) state plane - shock model ( vpshock model in conjunction with the nei version 2.0 in the xspec software , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that is based on atomdb @xcite .",
    "we used an augmented version of this atomic database to include inner - shell processes ( e.g. , lines from li - like ions ) and updates of the fe l - shell lines , whose effects are substantial in under - ionized plasma , but are not incorporated in the standard xspec nei version 2.0 .",
    "we fixed the galactic column at @xmath30 = 6 @xmath3 10@xmath31 @xmath32 toward n49 @xcite .",
    "we fit the foreground column by the lmc ( @xmath33 ) assuming the lmc abundances available in the literature ( he = 0.89 , c = 0.30 , n = 0.12 , o = 0.26 , ne = 0.33 , na = 0.30 , mg = 0.32 , al = 0.30 , si = 0.30 , s = 0.31 , cl = 0.31 , ar = 0.54 , ca = 0.34 , cr = 0.61 , fe = 0.36 , co = 0.30 , and ni = 0.62 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hereafter , elemental abundances are with respect to solar @xcite .",
    "the southern boundary of n49 was not covered by obsids 747 and 1957 because of the use of a 1/8 subarray .",
    "thus , we used our new _",
    "chandra _ data to extract the spectrum from the shell region .",
    "the background was subtracted using the spectrum extracted from two circular source - free regions ( with a radius of 8@xmath28 ) beyond the south - western boundary of the snr .",
    "the shell region spectrum contains significant photon statistics of @xmath94600 counts , and can be well fitted by the nei plane - shock model ( @xmath34/n = 49.1/68 with the electron temperature @xmath35 = 0.57 kev and the ionization timescale @xmath36 = 6.35 @xmath3 10@xmath37 @xmath16 s , figure  [ fig : fig3]a ) .",
    "the foreground column by the lmc is estimated to be @xmath33 @xmath9 0.9 @xmath3 10@xmath38 @xmath32 .",
    "the best - fit metal abundances are generally consistent with the lmc values .",
    "results from this spectral model fit are summarized in tables  [ tbl : tab2 ] & [ tbl : tab3 ] .",
    "the sgr_bg region was observed by obsids 747 and 1957 as well as our new _",
    "chandra _ observations , and thus , we used all of those data to extract the spectrum from this region .",
    "the total photon statistics for this region is @xmath913600 counts .",
    "the background was subtracted using the spectrum extracted from a circular source - free region ( with a radius of 8@xmath28 ) beyond the northern boundary of the snr .",
    "we initially fit these three data sets simultaneously with all fitted parameters tied with each other .",
    "although the overall fit may be acceptable ( @xmath34/n = 1.28 ) , there appears to be a small systematic offset in the normalization at @xmath39 @xmath29 1 kev between data taken in 2000/2001 ( obsids 747 and 1957 ) and in 2009 ( obsids 10123 + 10806 + 10807 + 10808 ) .",
    "considering the fact that the time separation between 2000/2001 and 2009 observations is substantial and that the effect appears to be emphasized in the soft band ( @xmath39 @xmath29 1 kev ) , this small discrepancy is likely related to the calibration effect by the time - dependent quantum efficiency degradation in the acis . since the quantum efficiency degradation affects the spectral modeling as if there is an `` extra '' foreground absorption , we attempted the model fit with @xmath40 untied among three spectra .",
    "the best - fit @xmath40 values are the same between 2000 and 2001 data , while it is @xmath925% larger for the 2009 data .",
    "thus , we repeated the spectral model fit with @xmath40 tied only between 2000 and 2001 data , and with that for 2009 data allowed to vary freely .",
    "the fit improved somewhat ( @xmath34/n = 1.19 ) .",

    "while showing a marginal calibration effect , these values are consistent within statistical uncertainties ( hereafter , errors are with a 90% confidence level ) . in the following discussion , we assume the average value of @xmath40 = 1.58@xmath43 @xmath3 10@xmath38 @xmath32 . the best - fit spectral parameters for the sgr_bg region are @xmath35 @xmath9 0.56 kev and @xmath36 @xmath9 9.65 @xmath3 10@xmath37 @xmath16 s , all of which are consistent with those for the shell region within uncertainties .",
    "the best - fit metal abundances are also generally consistent with those from the shell region .",
    "these model parameters are summarized in tables  [ tbl : tab2 ] & [ tbl : tab3 ] .",
    "data clearly resolve the extended nature of the ejecta fragment bullet ( the head region ) and the trailing tail - like hot gas ( the tail region , figure  [ fig : fig1]c ) . because the bullet region was not covered by the 2000/2001 data , we used only 2009 data for the spectral analysis of this feature .",
    "we extracted @xmath91800 counts from the head region .",
    "in contrast to those for the swept - up medium , the x - ray spectrum of the head region shows remarkably enhanced emission lines from highly ionized si and s ( figure  [ fig : fig4]a ) , which is consistent with the corresponding bright si line ew image ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a ) .",
    "we fitted this spectrum with an nei plane - shock model following the method described in section  [ subsubsec : ism ] .",
    "the background was subtracted using the same spectrum as we used for the shell region .",
    "we initially fixed metal abundances at the best - fit values for the shell region ( table  [ tbl : tab3 ] ) , which resulted in a statistically unacceptable fit ( @xmath34/n = 3.3 ) primarily because of the strongly enhanced si and s lines .",
    "varying si and s abundances provides an acceptable fit ( @xmath34/n = 67.0/59 , figure  [ fig : fig4]a ) . the best - fit lmc column ( @xmath33 @xmath9 1.3 @xmath3 10@xmath38 @xmath32 ) is consistent with those estimated from the shell and sgr_bg regions . the electron temperature ( @xmath35 @xmath9 1 kev ) and the ionization timescale ( @xmath36 @xmath44 2 @xmath3 10@xmath45 @xmath16 s ) are significantly higher than those from swept - up medium .",
    "the si ( @xmath92.3 ) and s ( @xmath93.2 ) abundances are an order of magnitude larger than the lmc values , firmly establishing the metal - rich ejecta nature of the bullet .",
    "varying other elemental abundances ( o , ne , mg , and fe ) somewhat improves the fit ( @xmath34/n = 49.3/55 , but the corresponding f - probability is marginal [ @xmath90.002 ] ) , and the best - fit electron temperature is very high ( @xmath35 @xmath9 4 kev ) .",
    "in addition to the overabundant si and s , the best - fit abundance appears to be moderately enhanced for o ( @xmath90.7 ) , ne ( @xmath92.1 ) , and mg ( @xmath91.0 ) .",
    "however , these abundances are not well constrained ( with a factor of @xmath462 uncertainties ) , and thus the overabundance for these elements is not convincing based on the current data .",
    "we conclude that the main differences in the fitted parameters resulting from varying metal abundances other than si and s ( i.e. , the high @xmath35 @xmath9 4 kev and possibly enhanced abundances for o , ne , and mg ) are not compelling . otherwise , it does not affect our discussion of the ejecta features ( see section  [ subsec : disc_ejecta ] ) .",
