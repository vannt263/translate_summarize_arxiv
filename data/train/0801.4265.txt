    "everyone knows the popular child puzzle called `` 15 '' .",
    "it consists of a @xmath0 grid of numbered sliding square tiles with one free slot ( vacancy ) .",
    "initially the tiles are jumbled .",
    "in the course of the game , not only the empty slot moves around the grid , but the ( marked ) tiles also move , and can take different relative positions for a fixed position of the vacancy .",
    "the goal of the game is to unjumble the tiles by successive moves , each one consisting in sliding a tile into the empty slot .",
    "it is easy to see , and this is true for a grid of arbitrary size , that the vacancy can freely reach an arbitrary position .    to complicate the game ,",
    "take now rectangular tiles dimers or dominoes of size @xmath1 or @xmath2 instead of square ones , and consider tiling a large grid with those , leaving , as before , an empty slot of unit surface , i.e. a monomer ( so the number of sites in the grid must be odd ) .",
    "the possible movements of the vacancy are now conditioned by the orientation of the neighboring dimers , since a dimer can slide only if it is oriented towards the vacancy .",
    "the main question , raised and studied in @xcite , is then : what are the positions that the vacancy can possibly reach under these moves ?",
    "bouttier _ et al _ @xcite have analyzed this question by looking at various quantities related to the statistics of the domain accessible to the vacancy ( unlike in the game `` 15 '' , the dimers are not marked ) .",
    "building on the well - known temperley correspondence between fully - packed dimer configurations ( i.e. with no vacancy ) and spanning trees , they showed that the correspondence can be extended to dimer configurations with a single vacancy , which are then put in bijection with spanning webs .",
    "generically , a spanning web consists of a central tree , growing from the site where the vacancy is located , surrounded by a number of nested loops to which further branches are attached .",
    "they proved that the domain accessible to the vacancy is exactly given by the tree component .",
    "given a uniform distribution on the dimer configurations for a fixed position of the vacancy , the previous correspondence induces a distribution on the spanning webs with statistical weights depending on their number of loops , and implicitly defines a non - trivial distribution on the clusters of sites accessible to the vacancy .",
    "putting the vacancy at the central site of a square , odd - by - odd grid , bouttier _ et al _ performed numerical calculations on finite grids and then extrapolated their findings to very large or infinite lattices .",
    "one of the main results of their analysis is that the delocalization probability @xmath3 , defined as the probability that the cluster of sites accessible to the vacancy covers the whole grid , decays like @xmath4 for large @xmath5 , the linear size of the grid . from this result",
    ", the probability @xmath6 that the domain accessible to the vacancy has size @xmath7 , in infinite volume , was estimated to decay like @xmath8 for large @xmath7 . at the other end of the scale ,",
    "the values of @xmath9 for small values of @xmath7 were computed exactly for finite grids , and used to assess the asymptotic values in infinite volume .",
    "the numerical values reported in @xcite for @xmath10 , the probability that the vacancy be strictly jammed , and @xmath11 , the probability that the vacancy can make exactly one move , are @xmath12 and @xmath13 . moreover , using plouffe s inverter @xcite applied to the first ten digits of @xmath14 , the authors of @xcite were able to conjecture the exact value of @xmath10 , namely @xmath15 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath11 remained unknown .",
    "our aim of this paper is to revisit these questions , and to provide an analytical derivation of some of the results mentioned above , mainly the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as well as other quantities , which are relevant to the diffusion properties of the vacancy .",
    "in particular we obtain the exact value of @xmath11 , @xmath16 which agrees with all significant digits given in @xcite .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we review the bijection between dimer configurations with the fixed vacancy and spanning webs , as formulated and developed in @xcite , and discuss the spanning web enumeration technique . in section [ sec3 ] , we discuss the situation when the spanning webs can include a maximal , finite number of loops , in the infinite volume limit , and relate it to the finite - size scaling of the delocalization probability found in @xcite . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we analyze the probability that the vacancy take at least one step in a particular direction , while section [ sec5 ] contains the results announced above for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "consider a square grid @xmath17 of odd size .",
    "let the vertices be colored in black and white like a chessboard , so that neighboring vertices have different colors . for definiteness , we assume that the corner vertices of the grid , which all have the same color , are white . with this coloring ,",
    "there is one more white vertex than black ones so that the grid can be fully covered by dimers with a single vacancy on a white vertex .",
    "fig.[fig1]a shows a possible configuration of dimers with the vacancy ( represented as @xmath18 ) .    ) on a @xmath19 grid .",
    "the other two panels show the corresponding spanning webs defined ( b ) on the odd sublattice @xmath20 , and , ( c ) on the even sublattice @xmath21.,width=604 ]    according to @xcite , a dimer lying next to the vacancy can move ( by one site ) and cover the vacancy if it is oriented towards it . after the sliding of the dimer ,",
    "the vacancy has moved by two sites , but remains on the white sublattice . in the example of fig.[fig1]a , the upper and the right neighboring dimers of the vacancy can be moved ; equivalently",
    ", the vacancy can move two sites upwards or two sites rightwards .",
    "the coordinates of each white vertex are either both even or both odd , so there are two types of white vertices , even and odd .",
    "the sublattices of even and odd white vertices are called respectively even and odd as well , and denoted @xmath21 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is slightly smaller than @xmath20 ) .",
    "if the vacancy or a dimer are located on an even ( odd ) vertex , then we will call them respectively an even ( odd ) vacancy and an even ( odd ) dimer .",
    "it is easy to see that the parity of the vacancy does not change during its motions .",
    "assume that it is odd , like in the example of fig.[fig1]a .",
    "to set up the correspondence between dimer and spanning web configurations , we first remove the black and even vertices and keep the odd dimers only .",
    "we then replace each odd dimer by an arrow of length @xmath22 , starting from the odd vertex and directed along the dimer .",
    "the arrow configuration obtained from the example in fig.[fig1]a is shown in fig.[fig1]b .",
    "the set of all possible arrow configurations obtained in this way from dimer configurations with a fixed odd vacancy forms the set of spanning webs defined on the odd sublattice . as illustrated in fig.[fig1]b , a spanning web",
    "consists of a central tree component , rooted at the vacancy location and oriented towards it , surrounded by a number of nested directed loops with branches attached to the loops .",
    "the sites contained in the central tree are precisely the sites which are accessible to the vacancy . indeed , looking back at the original dimer configuration",
    ", one sees that the central tree is enclosed by a loop of even dimers which acts as a cage for the vacancy .",
    "if the central tree covers the whole of the odd sublattice , no loop is allowed and the spanning web is a spanning tree .",
    "this is automatically the case when the vacancy is at a boundary site .",
    "conversely , if we have a fixed spanning web on the odd sublattice , we can reconstruct the dimer configuration up to the orientation of the dimer loops on the even sublattice .",
    "indeed the set of even dimers also form a spanning web on the even sublattice , which is dual to the one on the odd sublattice ( see fig.[fig1]c ) . the central piece of an even spanning web is a loop , whose interior is the domain accessible to the odd vacancy .",
    "the even spanning web has the same number of loops as its dual odd web , but its tree components are oriented towards the exterior of the lattice . an odd spanning web fixes the shape of the even spanning web but not the orientation of its loops ( if any ) .",
    "since there are two possible orientations per loop , @xmath23 dimer configurations correspond to each odd ( or even ) spanning web with @xmath24 loops .",
    "so we can enumerate all dimer configurations on the original lattice by counting the spanning webs on the odd ( or even ) sublattice with a weight @xmath23 .",
    "the same construction can be made when the vacancy is even ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) , but in this case the situation is slightly asymmetric with respect to the choice of even or odd spanning webs .",
    "indeed it is not difficult to see that the odd spanning webs contain one more loop than the even spanning webs .",
    "this affects the formulae with a factor @xmath25 or 2 depending on the choice one makes , namely @xmath26 .    which spanning webs and vacancy ,",
    "even or odd , we use is a matter of convenience . in @xcite ,",
    "the odd vacancy is located at the center of a @xmath27 grid , and the authors chose to work with the odd spanning webs .",
    "we finish this section by recalling how the enumeration can be carried out .",
    "we assume that the vacancy is odd , and we choose the spanning webs on the even sublattice @xmath21 , taken to be finite for the moment . as remarked above , the outmost piece of such a web is a ( disconnected ) tree , rooted at the exterior of @xmath21 . from kirchhoff",
    "s theorem , the number of spanning webs for which the outer tree fully covers @xmath21 , i.e. spanning trees , is equal to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the discrete laplacian on @xmath21 with open boundary conditions , @xmath30    in order to count not only the spanning trees but also the spanning webs , we have to allow for loops circling around the vacancy ( which lies on @xmath20 ) .",
    "this can be done by choosing a defect line connecting the vacancy to the boundary , for instance the dotted line shown in fig.[fig1]c .",
    "then we define a frustrated laplacian matrix @xmath31 , equal to @xmath29 except that @xmath32 for all those nearest neighbour sites connected by a bond ( of @xmath21 ) which crosses the defect line . because any loop enclosing the vacancy necessarily contains an odd number of frustrated edges , it",
    "can then be shown @xcite that the determinant of @xmath31 counts the number of spanning webs with the correct weight , namely @xmath23 if the web contains @xmath24 loops , @xmath33    if @xmath34 are the pairs of neighbouring sites separated by the defect line , for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 depends on the size of the grid , the position of the vacancy and the defect line that has been chosen , the matrix @xmath31 can be seen as a perturbation of @xmath29 , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 this allows to relate the number of spanning webs to the number of spanning trees , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the green matrix , @xmath41 .",
    "this number is the inverse of the localization probability introduced in @xcite .",
    "let us note that the previous formula requires that @xmath42 be non - zero , and so is not defined in the case of an even vacancy if the odd spanning webs are used , since @xmath43 would be subjected to the closed boundary conditions , implying @xmath44 .",
    "consider first the situation of a finite defect line , of length @xmath36 .",
    "the system is first confined in a finite grid ; the infinite volume limit is then taken , while keeping @xmath36 finite but large .",
    "this situation is geometrically depicted in fig.[slit0 ] .    .",
    "the vacancy ( on the left ) is odd , while the sites @xmath45 are even.,width=377 ]    the perturbed laplacian corresponding to the finite defect line is @xmath46 with the non - zero part of @xmath47 given by    @xmath48 the defect matrix @xmath47 is a @xmath49 matrix , with indices ranging over @xmath50 .",
    "we want to compute the ratio @xmath51 which is the fraction of arrow configurations on the even sublattice with at most @xmath36 loops , each containing an odd number of frustrated bonds , compared to the number of spanning trees . in terms of dimers",
    ", we can think of two odd vacancies placed at the two ends of the defect line , with the loops enclosing one of the two vacancies .    if the even sublattice is a finite grid of size @xmath5 , the determinants in the numerator and denominator are @xmath52 , but because the matrix @xmath47 has rank @xmath53 , the rightmost determinant in ( [ d0 ] ) is only @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath5 goes to infinity , the order of this determinant remains equal to @xmath53 , and the inverse laplacian @xmath40 may be replaced by the inverse laplacian @xmath54 on the infinite lattice .",
    "then the simple block form of @xmath47 makes it possible to factorize the corresponding determinant into two @xmath36-by-@xmath36 determinants of toeplitz matrices : @xmath55 with the matrices @xmath56 given by @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the translational invariance of the green function , @xmath59 with @xmath60 , shows that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are toeplitz matrices , and the reflection symmetries imply @xmath63 from the explicit formula , @xmath64^{|q| }   \\over \\sqrt{(2 - \\cos \\varphi)^2 - 1 } } \\ , { \\rm e}^{\\i\\varphi p},\\ ] ] we find the generating functions @xmath65    the determinants of @xmath66 can be computed by using widom s theorem , a generalization of szeg s theorem @xcite .",
    "let @xmath67 be a function on the unit circle of the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a smooth univalent function , nowhere vanishing nor divergent .",
    "then the asymptotic value of the toeplitz determinant formed with the fourier coefficients @xmath70 of @xmath71 , is given by @xmath72 \\",
    ", n^{\\alpha^2 } \\ , { \\rm e}^{n(\\log g)_0 } , \\qquad n \\gg 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the zeroth fourier coefficient of @xmath74 , and @xmath75 $ ] is a constant whose explicit value can be found in @xcite .    applying this theorem to @xmath76 and @xmath77 yields",
    "@xmath78 and consequently , @xmath79 where @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "finally , we obtain the ratio ( [ d0 ] ) , for large @xmath36 : @xmath81    we should notice that @xmath82 is actually divergent , with a divergence proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "this is clearly due to the fact that @xmath76 has a non - integrable singularity ( @xmath84 ) , which manifests itself in @xmath85 by the constant @xmath86 $ ] being singular when @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "physically , this is not surprising either , since there are much more ( infinitely more in thermodynamic limit ) spanning webs than spanning trees .",
    "however the divergence does not depend on @xmath36 , which means that we get the same `` infinity '' for @xmath88 as for any other value of @xmath36 .",
    "this suggests the better definition of @xmath89 as the relative fraction of spanning webs with at most @xmath36 loops with respect , not to the spanning trees , but to the spanning webs with at most one loop . the corresponding ratio , after a proper regularization ( see @xcite for instance ) , would then be well - defined . in any case",
    ", we will ignore the divergence , since only ratios of @xmath89 are relevant for what follows .",
    "the quantity @xmath89 as such does not quite compare with the delocalization probability studied by bouttier _",
    "et al _ in @xcite .",
    "we may however , cut the plane by inserting a vertical boundary passing through the sites @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and consider the left half - plane only . in this way , the arrow configurations forming spanning webs with loops around the single vacancy are generated , and we recover a situation similar the one studied in @xcite , except that we work on a half - plane rather than on a large square . which boundary conditions , open or closed , are imposed on the vertical boundary make no difference .",
    "the above formulas ( [ d0n ] ) , ( [ s ] ) and ( [ ss ] ) remain valid provided one uses the green function appropriate to the chosen boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting @xmath56 matrices in ( [ skl ] ) are no longer toeplitz but pick a hankel piece , depending on @xmath92 .",
    "we have nevertheless computed the corresponding determinants numerically .",
    "our numerical results for this case show that the power @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ webs ] ) is changed to @xmath93 , which agrees with the exponent found in @xcite .",
    "it is instructive also to compare the asymptotics ( [ webs ] ) with that obtained by fisher and stephenson @xcite for the monomer - monomer correlations . considering a pair of monomers located at two sites separated by an odd number of bonds of the original lattice",
    ", they obtained the asymptotic correlation proportional to @xmath94 , with @xmath36 the distance between the monomers . in our case , the vacancies belong to the same sublattice and are therefore separated by an even number of bonds .",
    "the difference between the two asymptotics demonstrates the crucial role of the loop statistics which is quite different in these cases .",
    "as a preparation , we start by computing the probability @xmath95 that the vacancy can move at least one step in a specific direction , in the infinite volume limit . due to the rotational symmetry , @xmath95 can be interpreted as an efficient mobility of the vacancy in any direction . for convenience ,",
    "we use in this section the spanning webs defined on the odd sublattice , so that the sites @xmath45 defining the defect line are on the same sublattice as the odd vacancy , located at the site @xmath96 , see fig.[slit1 ] .    with respect to the discussion in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the difference implied by the use of the odd sublattice is that the laplacian of reference is now @xmath97 , namely the laplacian with closed boundary condition and a root at @xmath96 . for actual calculations",
    ", one can take @xmath98 in which case the number of spanning trees growing from the root is equal to @xmath99 . as in the previous section ,",
    "loops are included by using the perturbed laplacian @xmath100 .",
    "the asymmetry of the descriptions afforded by the even and odd vacancies , mentioned in section ii , implies that the number of dimer configurations with one vacancy is equal @xmath101 for an odd vacancy or @xmath102 for an even vacancy , with @xmath103 . on a finite grid ,",
    "these two numbers are slightly different , but become equal in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "suppose that the vacancy can take one step upwards , so that the dimer covering the odd site @xmath104 is oriented toward @xmath96 , like on fig.[slit1]b . in terms of arrows , there is an arrow pointing from @xmath104 to @xmath96 .",
    "the number of arrow configurations with this arrow from @xmath104 to @xmath96 is equal to the number of arrow configurations for which @xmath104 is also a root ( in addition to @xmath96 ) . indeed",
    "the two roots generate separate branches attached to them , but these branches can be joined to a single tree , if we place a fixed arrow ( dimer ) from @xmath104 to @xmath96 . in this way , we generate all spanning webs on the odd sublattice with an odd vacancy at @xmath96 and an arrow on the bond @xmath105 $ ] . therefore , by enumerating these spanning webs and dividing the result by the total number of spanning webs without the arrow constraint , we obtain the probability @xmath106 that the vacancy can make a step upwards .",
    "turning the site @xmath104 into a root requires to further perturb @xmath107 by the diagonal term @xmath108 .",
    "the resulting laplacian can be written as @xmath109 , where the non - zero entries of @xmath110 are b_i_k , j_k^(1 ) = b_j_k , i_k^(1 ) & = & 2,k=1,2, ",
    ",n , + b_i_n+1,i_n+1^(1 ) & = & b_j_n+1,j_n+1^(1 ) = .    on a finite grid , the probability that the vacancy can make a step upwards is equal to the ratio @xmath111 in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the denominator can be replaced by @xmath112 , and @xmath113 by the laplacian on the plane @xmath43 , so that the previous ratio goes to @xmath114 of which the limit @xmath115 readily yields @xmath106 .",
    "the nonzero part of the defect matrix @xmath110 consists of two blocks of size @xmath116 . as in the previous case",
    ", the corresponding determinant @xmath117 can be factorized into two toeplitz matrices of size @xmath116 , @xmath118 for the same matrices @xmath119 and @xmath120 as in the previous section , except that their indices run from @xmath121 to @xmath116 , and where the matrices @xmath122 are defined as @xmath123 for any @xmath124 .",
    "the expansion of these determinants by the last element @xmath125 gives @xmath126 therefore , using ( [ jm ] ) , ( [ webs ] ) and ( [ one - step2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath127",
    "dimer configurations with a vacancy on the odd sublattice are in correspondence with spanning webs on the even sublattice . as recalled above , the central part of an even spanning web consists of a loop surrounding a certain number of odd sites of the original lattice , which exactly form the domain accessible to the vacancy . following @xcite , let @xmath9 be the probability that this domain has size @xmath7 when the grid is finite ( with size proportional to @xmath5 ) , and let @xmath6 be its infinite volume limit value .",
    "hereafter , we compute @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the probabilities that the vacancy can take respectively zero or one move , so that @xmath10 is the probability that the vacancy be fully jammed . we start with @xmath10 .",
    "if the vacancy is fully jammed , it has to be surrounded by four dimers , arranged as in fig.[slit2]b or a similar pattern in which the dimer covering @xmath128 points west . in the two cases ,",
    "the arrows drawn on the even sublattice are constrained to form a minimal loop around the vacancy , so that the arrows originating from the four sites @xmath129 must form a cycle .",
    "let us now turn the sites @xmath129 into roots , like in the previous section .",
    "on the rest of the even sublattice , the arrows are all unconstrained , and can possible point towards @xmath130 or @xmath104 .",
    "if in addition , we insert a defect line of length @xmath36 as before , the arrows may form loops passing through the bonds @xmath131 .",
    "these changes lead to the perturbed laplacian @xmath132 , where the non - zero entries of the defect matrix are given by @xmath133 for @xmath134 very large .",
    "the determinant @xmath135 counts the number of even spanning webs with at most @xmath136 loops in presence of the four roots .",
    "every such spanning web gives rise to two dimer configurations on the whole lattice with nine vacancies , namely the original vacancy and the eight surrounding sites . in turn these eight sites",
    "can be covered by four dimers in two ways .",
    "thus the number of dimer coverings in which four dimers loop around the vacancy ( and with the number of even loops bounded by @xmath36 ) is equal to @xmath137 , and their fraction in the set of similar dimer coverings but with no restriction around the vacancy is @xmath138 in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath40 can be replaced by the green matrix on the plane , and the previous ratio becomes @xmath139 finally the limit @xmath115 gives the jamming probability @xmath10 , @xmath140 where @xmath89 is known from ( [ webs ] ) .    the rank @xmath141 determinant defining @xmath142 can be factorized as before , @xmath143 and yields the following form for the jamming probability @xmath10 , @xmath144    expanding the determinants and using the values of @xmath145 given in ( [ jm ] ) recasts the ratios as @xmath146 to leading order in @xmath36 .",
    "the notation @xmath147 stands for the principal minor @xmath148 .",
    "minors of toeplitz matrices have been very recently studied by bump and diaconis , who have obtained general formulae @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the expressions useful for the case at hand , and for the evaluation of @xmath11 below , are briefly recalled in the appendix . using them , we obtain the asymptotic value @xmath149 the two ratios ( [ 2ratios ] ) are",
    "then both equal to @xmath150 for large @xmath36 , and yield the result quoted in @xcite , @xmath151    the similar calculation can be carried out for @xmath11 .",
    "if the vacancy can take one and only one step , the dimers around it must be organized as in fig.[slit3]b . in terms of arrows drawn on the even sublattice",
    ", they all correspond to fix a rectangular length @xmath152 loop running around the vacancy .",
    "the shape of the loop can be rotated by @xmath153 degrees , and each loop may have two orientations , making eight different situations .",
    "they however all contribute the same number .",
    "the arguments used for @xmath10 apply to this case as well , leading to a perturbation of the laplacian involving six roots and a defect line of length @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding defect matrix @xmath154 therefore reads @xmath155    reasoning as before , the determinant @xmath156 counts the number of even spanning webs with at most @xmath136 loops in presence of six roots . again",
    "every such spanning web gives rise to two dimer configurations on the whole lattice with fifteen vacancies , namely all the sites shown in fig.[slit3]b .",
    "if one excepts the vacancy itself , the other fourteen sites can be covered by seven dimers in eight different ways , among which only two contain a 6-dimer loop .",
    "so the number of dimer coverings in which six dimers make a loop around the vacancy ( and with the number of even loops bounded by @xmath36 ) is equal to @xmath157 .",
    "their fraction in the set of similar dimer coverings but with no restriction around the vacancy is , in the thermodynamic limit , equal to @xmath158 taking the limit @xmath115 and multiplying the result by 4 to account for the four rotations of the rectangle yields the jamming probability @xmath11 , @xmath159    , corresponding to a 6-dimer loop around the vacancy.,title=\"fig:\",height=113 ] , corresponding to a 6-dimer loop around the vacancy.,title=\"fig:\",height=113 ]    the factorized form of @xmath160 reads @xmath161 straightforward algebra reduces the ratios to previous results and two new types of minors , @xmath162 to leading order in @xmath36 , and where @xmath163 is the determinant @xmath164 .",
    "the evaluation of these two minors is again a simple application of the bump - diaconis formulae @xcite .",
    "surprisingly we find that the four minors are equal by pairs , @xmath165    inserting these results in the above equations , we obtain the exact value for @xmath11 , @xmath166 as it was quoted in the introduction .",

    "we collect here the various formulae used in section [ sec5 ] to compute specific minors of toeplitz matrices .",
    "these are but particular cases of more general expressions proved by bump and diaconis in @xcite .",
    "in fact the asymptotic values of exactly the same determinants have been obtained by tracy and widom @xcite at about the same time .",
    "however their general answer takes a different form and appears to be less convenient for concrete calculations .",
    "generically these formulae evaluate the determinants of toeplitz matrices with certain rows and columns removed or shifted , and which are , as a consequence , no longer toeplitz . for @xmath67 a function on the unit circle , let @xmath167 be the usual rank @xmath36 toeplitz matrix associated to the symbol @xmath71 , and @xmath168 its determinant .",
    "now let @xmath169 be a partition of @xmath170 , that is , a decreasing sequence of non - negative integers @xmath171 such that @xmath172 , and likewise , let @xmath173 be a partition of @xmath174 . for fixed @xmath175 ,",
