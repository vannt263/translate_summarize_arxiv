    "the dynamics of metastable systems is a subject that may be found in all realms of physics . in condensed matter physics , in polymer transitions @xcite and liquid mixtures",
    "@xcite ; in high energy physics , in the problem of baryon number violation @xcite and in the formation of chiral condensates in heavy ions collisions @xcite ; in astrophysics , in `` nucleating planets '' ; in cosmology , in the well known inflationary models @xcite .",
    "all these examples have at least one thing in common : the occurrence of metastability , which requires non - equilibrium methods .    as a model for learning something about the qualitative features of the decays of metastable states",
    ", we will study a one - dimensional system of interacting fermions and bosons that starts in a metastable vacuum and gradually decays to the true one .",
    "the process considered here will be the nucleation of `` bubbles '' of true vacuum inside the false one via thermal activation .",
    "our main purpose will be the analysis of the stability of these `` bubbles '' and the calculation of the decay rate as a function of time , in the presence of a finite density of fermions at finite temperature . as already shown in reference @xcite ,",
    "the decay rate is time - dependent as opposed to the time - independent results previously found in the literature @xcite . this is a direct consequence of the use of the non - equilibrium formalism .",
    "the results presented here appear to be in qualitative agreement with some experimental results .",
    "the introduction of fermions that interact with the scalar field has two remarkable features .",
    "the first , already used in reference @xcite , is the preservation of the functional form of the bosonic static solution of the equation of motion for the case with no fermions . through the inverse scattering methods used here",
    ", this fact is rigorously demonstrated .",
    "the second is the appearance of metastability within metastability . besides the metastability which is inherent to our choice of the metastable minimum of the effective bosonic potential , we find that the extrema of such a potential may be metastable `` bubbles '' .",
    "thus , throughout this article , the metastable state ( for example , the first excited state of a _",
    "cis_-polymer ) may develop defects which correspond to either unstable or metastable `` bubbles '' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ bosonic ] , we briefly review the results for just a scalar field , which already appeared in the literature ; in section [ inclusion ] , we include fermion fields and analyze their influence on the effective theory for the bosons ; in section [ chemical ] , we add the effects of finite temperature and of a chemical potential for the fermions ; in section [ concl ] , we present some comments about the method and our conclusions .",
    "some mathematical definitions are left for a final appendix .",
    "in this section we summarize results concerning the decay of metastable bosonic systems . most of the material presented here may be found in various recent papers @xcite .      our bosonic system",
    "is represented by a real one - dimensional scalar field , @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics is given by a lagrangian with the following form    @xmath1    where    @xmath2    the lagrangian ( [ lagrangeana ] ) has an asymmetric double well potential,@xmath3 , with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the squared mass of small oscillations around the local minimum @xmath6 ( see figure 1 ) and @xmath7 is a coupling constant .",
    "the equation of motion associated with ( [ lagrangeana ] ) has a static solution known as `` sphaleron '' @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to a field configuration that starts at the false vacuum @xmath6 , almost reaches the true vacuum @xmath8 , and returns to @xmath6 .",
    "it looks like a `` droplet '' and its explicit form is given by @xcite    @xmath9-\\tanh \\left[{m\\over 2}(x - x_{c.m.})-s_0\\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ]    where",
    "@xmath10    the parameter @xmath11 reflects the translational invariance of the equation of motion , @xmath12 gives a measure of the difference in depth between the true and the false vacua and @xmath13 is related to what we may call the radius of the `` sphaleron '' ( see figure 2 ) . as we will see later , this latter parameter assumes great importance in the analysis of stability .",
    "it proves convenient to expand the field @xmath0 and and its conjugated momentum @xmath14 around the `` sphaleron '' configuration , so as to express the hamiltonian in this particular basis . collecting terms up to second order",
    ", the hamiltonian acquires the following form    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the set of eigenvalues of the fluctuation operator .",
    "this form of the hamiltonian clearly isolates the contributions coming from the energy of the `` sphaleron '' itself , the collection of harmonic oscilators , the translational mode and , most important , the presence of an inverted oscillator with frequency @xmath17 .",
    "this last contribution signals the existence of an unstable direction in funcional space ( associated with @xmath18,which itself is associated with @xmath13 @xcite ) ready to guide the decay .",
    "indeed , a short glance at the behavior of the energy of the `` bubble '' is promoted to the status of a dynamical variable called @xmath19 . ]",
    "as a function of its `` radius '' , @xmath19 , shows us three possible regimes : for @xmath20 , the `` bubble '' shrinks and disappears ; for @xmath21 , the `` bubble '' grows without limit and , for @xmath22 , we have the critical `` bubble '' , ready to fall ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "as we have seen in the last section , the decay of our metastable vacuum may take place through the nucleation , via thermal activation , of `` bubbles '' with radius larger than the critical @xmath13 . in order to obtain the decay rate for this process",
    ", we must calculate the probability current along the unstable direction , at the saddle point .",
    "assuming as our initial density matrix one that represents a set of harmonic oscillators of frequency @xmath23 centered at the metastable minimum @xmath6 , and integrating over all the degrees of freedom but @xmath24 , one obtains , after some algebraic manipulations , the reduced initial density matrix @xcite ( projected onto the unstable direction , @xmath24 , of functional space    @xmath25 \\right\\}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath26^{1/2 } % formula 3.3.24 % formula 3.3.25 % formula 3.3.26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the kernels are defined in the appendix .",
    "the time evolution of this matrix is dictated by the reduced hamiltonian    @xmath29\\ ] ]    through the liouville equation . using the most general gaussian _",
    "compatible with unitarity for the time - evolved density matrix , one obtains for the decay rate per unit volume ( see @xcite )    @xmath30=j[\\eta_{-1}]_{\\eta_{-1}=0}= \\nonumber \\\\ \\noalign{\\bigskip } & = & -\\omega\\bar\\phi_{-1}(0)\\ a(t)\\ \\sqrt{e_{sph}}\\ { \\cal n}(0 ) \\exp\\left\\ { -{1\\over \\hbar}\\ , \\bar\\phi^2_{-1}(0)[{\\cal r}(\\alpha(0))+\\gamma ( 0)]\\ b(t)\\right\\ } % formula 3.3.48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath31^{3/2}}\\ ] ]    @xmath32    the form of the decay rate as a function of time is given in figure 4 . to understand this plot",
    ", we should remember our initial hypothesis .",
    "we have defined a particular initial state for our system and decided to observe its `` natural '' evolution , i.e. , an out - of - equilibrium evolution which does not replenish the false vacuum .",
    "therefore , the insignificant overlap of the initial state with the saddle point forces @xmath33 to vanish at @xmath34 . on the other hand , for @xmath35 we have the decay to the true vacuum .",
    "thus , @xmath33 must vanish also for @xmath36 .",
    "further discussions of these results can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the inclusion of fermions in our scheme went beyond a simple generalization of the formalism .",
    "it was based on the belief that they would introduce qualitatively different results for the stability of the `` bubble '' structures .",
    "this hope relied on the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "as a consequence of the repulsive interaction of the fermions , we expected to find non - trivial metastable minima in the function @xmath37 $ ] .    throughout this section , we will be interested on the effects of fermions on the bosonic field .",
    "the natural way to proceed is to obtain , from an original fermion - boson lagrangian , an effective theory for the bosons .",
    "the original lagrangian is defined as    @xmath38 + \\bar\\psi_a(i\\not\\!\\!\\partial-\\mu - g\\phi)\\ \\psi_a\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the bare mass of the fermions , @xmath40 is the coupling constant , @xmath41 is the fermion field , @xmath42 denotes fermion species and @xmath43 is a local minimum of the potential    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a constant and @xmath46 is an external current , responsible for the asymmetry of the potential even in the purely bosonic case .",
    "we may now integrate the generating functional    @xmath47[d\\psi_a][d\\bar\\psi_a]\\exp\\left\\{i\\int^t_0dt\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty } dx \\ { \\cal l}[\\phi,\\psi_a,\\bar\\psi_a]\\right\\}\\ ] ]    over the fermions , in order to obtain an effective action for the bosons .",
    "following the methods of _ dashen et al . _",
    "@xcite , we arrive at the following expression for the effective action    @xmath48=\\int^t_0dt\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}dx\\left[{1\\over 2}(\\partial_\\mu\\phi)^2- [ v(\\phi)-v(\\phi_2)]\\right]+n\\sum_i \\alpha_i[\\phi ] -\\sum_in_i\\alpha_i[\\phi]\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 represent the number of fermion `` species '' , @xmath50 the occupation number of the discrete ( bound states ) fermionic levels and @xmath51 are the floquet indices , defined such that    @xmath52    assuming the existence of only two symmetric bound states and the possibility of `` doping '' , which will characterize particular configurations defined by the occupation numbers @xmath53 of the bound states , we may write the effective action as    @xmath54&=&\\int^t_0dt\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}dx\\left[{1\\over 2}(\\partial_\\mu\\phi)^2- [ v(\\phi)-v(\\phi_2)]\\right]+\\nonumber \\\\ & + & -\\int^t_0dt\\int^\\infty_{-\\infty}dx\\left [ { g^2\\over 2}(\\phi^2-\\phi^2_2)+b^*g^2(\\phi-\\phi_2)\\right]+\\nonumber \\\\ & + & n\\sum_{i<-1}(\\alpha_i[\\phi]-\\alpha_i[\\phi_2])-(n_+- n_-)(\\alpha_{1 } [ \\phi]- \\alpha_{1 } [ \\phi_2 ] ) \\label{acao2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have already introduced counterterms and renormalization conditions @xcite(that define @xmath55 through @xmath56 ) .",
    "note that @xmath57 represents the occupation number of particle states only , as opposed to @xmath53 which represents particle and anti - particle states ( @xmath58 ) .      in order to obtain time - independent solutions , analogous to the `` sphaleron ''",
    ", it proves useful to rewrite the action ( [ acao2 ] ) in terms of scattering data .",
    "using well known results from inverse scattering methods @xcite , we may write the effective action as    @xmath59\\over t}&=&-{i_3\\over g^2}-2\\left[(\\phi^2_2-\\phi^2_0)+{2\\mu\\over g}(\\phi_2-\\phi_0)\\right]\\ , i_1 -{j\\over g}\\ , i_0-\\nonumber\\\\ & -&(i_1-\\mu i_0)-b^*gi_0- { ni_2\\over \\pi}-(n_+-n_- ) [ \\omega_0 ( \\phi)- \\omega_0 ( \\phi_2 ) ] \\label{acao3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 have their explicit forms shown in the appendix .",
    "now , we may extremize the action with respect to the scattering data , namely , the reflection coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 ,    @xmath67    @xmath68    from ( [ extremos1 ] ) we obtain @xmath69 , ie , the potential is reflectionless . using this",
    ", we may write the energy as    @xmath70    and the equation for the extrema ( the gap equation ) as    @xmath71    where we have introduced the following definitions    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    equation ( [ eqextr ] ) determines the possible values for @xmath76 . from these , together with the gelfand - levitan - marchenko equation @xcite , we may obtain the explicit form of @xmath77    @xmath78-\\tanh\\left[k_0(x - s_0)+\\delta\\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath79    @xmath80    and @xmath81 is the normalization constant of the bound states . equation ( [ campo ] ) may be rewritten as    @xmath82    where    @xmath83    looking at ( [ camponovo ] ) we notice that , in spite of the presence of fermions , the functional form of the time - independent solution remained unchanged .",
    "the effect of the fermions is to rescale the parameters of the `` bubble '' .      in order to have an asymmetrical potential with a false vacuum located at positive @xmath43 ( see figure 5 ) , we must adjust the parameters such that @xcite    @xmath84    where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 is an extremum of @xmath88 .",
    "we are now able to obtain , numerically , the solutions of the gap equation ( [ eqextr ] ) and the form of the energy of the `` bubble '' as a function of its radius .",
    "assuming @xmath89 , we can plot these results for the interesting cases @xmath90 ( see figures 6 and 7 ) .    looking at these figures , we immediately see that our expectations are fulfilled in several cases .",
    "the reader will have noticed that the existence of a metastable `` bubble '' is associated with `` doping '' : for @xmath91 ( `` ground state '' ) we find just the `` sphaleron '' .    if we remember that we have an effective theory for the bosons , it should be clear that we are in the same situation as at the end of section 2.b .",
    "the differences are in the rescaling of the parameters of @xmath77 and in the form of @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "this latter difference will certainly imply a difference between the lifetimes of the `` sphaleron '' ( the `` bubble '' of critical radius ) and that of the metastable `` bubble '' .",
    "the decay rate may be calculated in the same manner ( see equation ( [ taxa ] ) ) with @xmath92 replaced with @xmath93 , @xmath94 being the energy of the metastable `` bubble '' , whenever appropriate .",
    "we should remark that , for temperatures which are low compared with @xmath95 , the metastable `` bubbles '' may have an appreciable lifetime .",
    "thus , if we consider small oscillations of these structures around the metastable minimum of @xmath37 $ ] , ie , oscillations in the size of the `` bubble '' , we may be able to detect their presence through their charges .",
    "a natural way to control the `` doping '' mentioned in the last section consists in the introduction of a chemical potential , @xmath96 .",
    "this may be implemented by adding , to our original lagrangian , a term like @xcite    @xmath97    the net effect of this term is to alter the form of our floquet indices to    @xmath98    we may now study the case of finite temperature by doing the analytic continuation @xmath99 , so that    @xmath100    using the results of _ dashen et al . _",

    "temperature plays a small role , as @xmath125 is small compared to the other energy scales .",
    "our results are , thus , analogous to the ones we encountered when we considered `` doping '' via a choice of occupation numbers .",
    "the aim of this work was the study of metastable systems , with particular interest in the stability of `` bubble '' structures .",
    "the novelty , in comparison with other recent papers , is the presence of fermions and the exciting role they play .",
    "as we have seen , the presence of fermions creates a qualitatively different scenario for the evolution of the `` bubbles '' . depending almost exclusively on `` doping '' ( relative occupation of bound fermionic states ) , which may be implemented by means of a chemical potential , we may find different regimes for the stability of the `` bubbles '' .",
    "more precisely , for non - trivial `` doping '' we encounter a phenomenon of `` quantum stabilization '' that brings about metastable `` bubbles '' .",
    "this striking feature , that comes as a consequence of the introduction of fermions , may cause important changes in the physics of the models used to describe the systems mentioned in the introduction .",
    "these results are a great stimulus for generalizing this work to higher dimensions",
    ". however , there are some points in our scheme that require improvement : the inclusion of spinodal decomposition to compete with the nucleation mechanism , and a careful study of tunneling , as a competitor of thermal activation , together with an improvement of some approximations , such as the use of the inverted oscilator @xcite , are some of the points to be refined in order to bring the formalism closer to reality .      e.s.f . would like to thank r.m .",
