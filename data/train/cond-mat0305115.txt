    "muscle fibers are composed by a great number of even smaller fibers , called myofibrils , arranged parallel to the muscle fiber s major axis .",
    "the myofibrils consist of two different filaments : thick filaments , composed by myosin molecules , and thin filaments , composed by actin molecules .",
    "myosin molecules extremity stick out from the filament as small heads .",
    "muscle contraction occurs when myosin molecules slide along actin filaments , fuelled by the chemical energy originating from atp hydrolysis . the traditional model explaining the mechanism of myosin movement is the so - called `` lever - arm swinging model '' in which the neck region of the myosin head swings to generate displacement ( see cooke @xcite ) .",
    "the swing motion is coupled tightly to the atp hydrolysis cycle i.e. the myosin molecule moves in a single forward step during each atpase reaction .",
    "the size of myosin displacement is about @xmath0 .    using new techniques for manipulating single actin filaments , kitamura _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have obtained highly precise and reliable measurements of the displacements performed by single myosin heads along actin filaments during their rising phases .",
    "they have recorded myosin displacements of @xmath1 .",
    "these values indicate that , during each biochemical cycle of atp hydrolysis , the myosin head may interact several times with an actin filament , undergoing multiple steps .",
    "the steps occur randomly in time , mainly in a forward direction , roughly not more than @xmath2 in the backward direction .",
    "the step - size is approximately @xmath3 , that identifies with the interval between adjacent monomers in one strand of the actin filament .",
    "these observations clearly contradict the traditional lever - arm model , suggesting that a biased brownian ratchet mechanism could be invoked : myosin head moves along the actin filament driven by the brownian motion and the atp hydrolysis biases the direction of the movement .    in this paper",
    "we propose a stochastic model for the description of the displacements performed by the myosin head durig a rising phase , on account of the experimental results presented in kitamura and yanagida @xcite .",
    "our model is not exactly a ratchet - based model but all the relevant basic ingredients are preserved : exploitation of brownian motion , the assumption that energy released by atp hydrolysis is responsible for the myosin displacements and the intrinsic asymmetry of the actomyosin system . to achieve directional motion , in addition to thermal noise and anisotropy",
    ", we consider an energy supply , resulting from the hydrolysis of atp ( see buonocore and ricciardi @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that this energy is stored by the myosin head and a part of it is released by small quanta of constant magnitudes .",
    "usually not each energy release produces a step , but several releases are needed to generate a single step .",
    "we further assume that myosin head is embedded in a viscous fluid in thermal equilibrium and denote by @xmath4 the viscous friction drag coefficient that in the experimental conditions is estimated as @xmath5 .",
    "aiming to a phenomenological model to account for the available data on the displacements of the myosin head along an actin filament , we take as starting point the articles by di crescenzo _ et al .",

    "myosin head s slide along the actin filament is viewed as a brownian motion perturbed by jumps that occurr according to a poisson process .",
