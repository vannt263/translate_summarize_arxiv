    "several methods which enable us to measure the surface differential rotation in late - type stars with convective envelopes have appeared in the literature .",
    "variability of stellar activity diagnostics such as the ca ii h & k emission cores has been used to determine stellar rotation periods as exemplified by the long term mount wilson survey @xcite . in many stars ,",
    "the measured rotation period is found to vary periodically from one epoch to another over timescales similar to the 11 year solar magnetic activity cycle .",
    "if we adopt the solar paradigm , in which changes in latitude of the active regions occur throughout the cycle , we can attribute the measured period changes to a latitude dependent rotation in stars .",
    "the scatter in measured periods gives some indication of the degree of differential rotation shear on the star @xcite .",
    "a similar method based on photometric modulation due to starspots , in a sample of stars , has been found to yield a trend in the degree of surface shear with rotation rate @xcite .",
    "long term variations of the photometric period been shown to be indicative of magnetic activity cycles @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have found that main - sequence stars of spectral types f and g exhibit high degrees of differential rotation .",
    "the rotational shear manifests itself in the fourier transforms of the rotationally broadened line profiles .",
    "this allows precise measurements of shear from line profiles alone for stars with intermediate rotation rates .",
    "a further method of determining the latitude dependence of rotation is to use spot distributions from indirect imaging techniques .",
    "here we do not have to make assumptions about the latitude extent of starspots in order to determine the magnitude of shear between the equator and pole .",
    "we are however restricted to observing rapid rotators if we are to obtain sufficient resolution elements across a rotationally broadened profile to make this technique viable .",
    "the number of resolution elements is determined by a number of stellar broadening mechanisms , but is ultimately limited by the instrumental resolution . by cross - correlating constant latitude strips in doppler images derived at closely related epochs ,",
    "the latitude dependent surface shear can be determined @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a differential rotation law ( usually assumed to be solar - like ) can be incorporated into the imaging model , and the whole data set from several nights combined to derive an image ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "with a spectral type of k5 - k7 , lo peg is one of the latest spectral type dwarfs which have been doppler imaged .",
    "additionally , it is the only main sequence star in the spectral type range to have been studied in this way .",
    "the evolution of starspots on the one - week timescale of the current observations is clearly quite small . over the longer five year time base ,",
    "the starspot morphology has also changed very little in terms of latitudinal distribution .",
    "the polar cap appears to have remained both stable and strong at both epochs of observation .",
    "this is intriguing because the slightly earlier spectral type ( k3v ) , but more rapidly rotating speedy mic showed no evidence for a polar cap @xcite when observed at a single epoch in 1998 .",
    "the early m dwarf stars , ek dra ( re1816 + 541 ) and hk aqr have similar periods to lo peg but do not possess polar caps , at more than one epoch in the latter case @xcite .",
    "there is however evidence that the young k0v star ab dor @xcite did not possess a polar cap in 1989 , in which case these large spots may disappear periodically .",
    "if such behaviour is ( quasi-)cyclic , it may be related to dynamo activity , although there is as yet no convincing evidence for this .    by simulating a star ten times more active than the sun",
    ", @xcite found that the higher rate of flux emergence , at around 30 times solar , resulted in the development of polar caps . but magnetic flux , as traced by starspots on lo peg , clearly does not emerge at low latitudes in the way we see on the sun . with the flux emergence patterns seen on young rapid rotators in mind , @xcite have investigated the role of meridional flows for stars where flux emerges up to latitude 70@xmath2 .",
    "in order to reproduce the intermingled polarity pattern as seen on the young rapid rotator , ab dor , strong meridional flows of around 100  are required .",
    "unfortunately we do not have magnetic maps of lo peg which would allow us to compare our results more closely , but the the flux distribution patterns do demand comparison with the simulation maps . @xcite",
    "have shown that much of the flux piles up at high latitudes , with less at intermediate latitudes . in the case where the rate of flux emergence shows cyclic behaviour ( with an 11 year cycle ) , but no change in the latitude at which flux erupts over that cycle , fewer spots are seen at low latitudes than intermediate and high latitudes . while the amount of flux at low latitudes varies throughout the cycle , features within a few degrees of the equator are present at all times .",
    "however when a solar - like variation of flux emergence with latitude , varying between @xmath370@xmath2(rather than the solar @xmath340@xmath2 ) to @xmath3 5@xmath2 , is simulated , there are times when no flux is present in the equatorial regions .",
    "a distribution resembling this situation is certainly seen on the present images of lo peg where we see no spots below 15@xmath2 . if observation can be reconciled with this picture of activity , long term doppler imaging projects are required .",
    "it is worth noting however that while @xcite found period variability , indicating the presence of active regions at different latitudes and differential rotation , the younger stars in the mount wilson survey tended to show no preferred period for magnetic cycles .",
    "a solar type interface dynamo predicts only spots at intermediate latitude in rapid rotators ( @xcite and @xcite ) . while spots _ do _ appear at intermediate latitudes in both 1993 and 1998",
    ", there is some structure at lower latitudes , while the images are dominated by polar or circumpolar spots . in many cases however , in addition to polar and circumpolar structure , spots my be seen in bands at low latitudes .",
    "this is the case for the young post - t tauri star , rx j1508.6 - 4423 @xcite and alpha per g dwarfs @xcite for example .",
    "the role of meridional flows have been touched upon above and are known , in the solar case at least , to possess maximum amplitude at equatorial latitudes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "flow rates following the solar pattern , but with greater amplitude , as modelled by @xcite , will then result in a lower chance of seeing starspots at low latitudes .",
    "another likely reason for no spots being observed at low latitudes is related to the low axial inclination of lo peg . at 45@xmath2 , spots in the equatorial latitudes of the star will appear severely foreshortened .",
    "if the s / n of the data is not sufficiently high , and only small spots exist , our imaging program may not find sufficient evidence for their presence .",
    "the differential rotation rate which we have measured for lo peg is interesting in the context of other measurements .",
    "the value of equator - pole lap time , , lies on a trend ( albeit sparsely populated ) with spectral type .",
    "@xcite found for the young g2 pre - main - sequence star rxj 1508.6 - 4423 , while @xcite found 14 d for the ic2602 g2 star , r58 .",
    "over a period of 8 years , @xcite found that the k0 dwarf ab dor exhibits systematic changes in differential rotation rate from one season to the next , with . at approximately the same spectral type",
    ", the near - one - day period pz tel @xcite exhibited an equator - pole lap time of 80 @xmath3 15 d. the latest spectral type star for which we have a differential rotation measurement @xcite is the dm1 - 2 object , hk aqr which exhibited an equator - pole lap time formally consistent with zero ( i.e. between ) although the sense of the differential rotation was not clear , the magnitude is essentially very small .",
    "lo peg clearly fits into this trend of generally decreasing differential rotation as we descend the main sequence from early g through to early m. the changing ab dor differential",
    "rotation however shows that there can be significant change , possibly dependent on the phase of a magnetic cycle . in all cases",
    ", the magnitude of differential rotation appears , to first order at least , to be independent of rotation rate .",
    "the sun for instance has an axial rotation period of and exhibits an equator - pole lap time of 120 d , whereas this value falls only by a factor of two ( twice the rate of differential rotation ) for rapidly rotating objects with 1/50th the solar period .",
    "these two predictions of weak rotation dependence and a decrease with rotation rate are predicted by the fluid circulation models of @xcite , although the exact magnitude of the predicted differential rotation does not match the observation .",
    "additionally , for a axial rotation period k5v star , these models predict a poleward meridional flow rate of @xmath4 10 , an order of magnitude lower than those required by @xcite in their simulations .",
    "clearly it would be desirable to determine an estimate of the magnitude and direction of flows observationally .",
