    "regards , the term @xmath14 is called as quantum force .",
    "this fact suggests that the quantum force is the new quantity which is responsible for the nonclassical behaviors of schrdinger equation .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to pay serious attention to the the property of the quantum potential .",
    "let us mention an important properties of quantum potential that will play important roles in our discussion later .",
    "first is multiplying the quantum probability density with a constant will not change the profile of the quantum potential .",
    "namely , the quantum potential is invariant under global rescaling of the quantum probability density , namely its own source , as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is constant .",
    "this shows that the quantum potential only cares about the form of the quantum probability density and is independent from the strength of the latter @xcite .",
    "it is as if the quantum potential considers the quantum probability density as a code in telecommunication system in case of which only the profile of the sequence of the binary wave is important , the strength of the received wave itself is of no use . in this sense ,",
    "the quantum potential is of informational nature . for an interesting and stimulating discussion concerning this matter see @xcite .    among the consequences of the above invariant property",
    "is that , first rescaling the quantum probability density by the mass of the particle , @xmath17 will not change the dynamical equation on the left of eq .",
    "( [ madelung fluid dynamics ] ) . on the other hand , the continuity equation on the right of eq .",
    "( [ madelung fluid dynamics ] ) becomes @xmath18 which can now be read as the equation for the conservation of mass density , rather than the conservation of quantum probability density .",
    "the other consequence of the scale invariance property of quantum potential is that even at points where the strength of the quantum probability density is very low , the quantum potential that it generates at that point might be very high . in this paper",
    ", we shall be interested in a class of quantum probability densities with this specific property .",
    "next , let us mention another property of quantum potential @xmath7 that the average of the quantum force , @xmath14 , over the quantum probability is vanishing @xcite @xmath19 this can be proven easily by assuming @xmath20 . imposing this into the dynamical equation of eq .",
    "( [ madelung fluid dynamics ] ) , one reproduces the ehrenfest theorem @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the average value of the velocity field defined as @xmath23 .",
    "let us now show that local geometrical restriction on the maximum point of the quantum probability density , if combined with the scale invariance of the quantum potential will determine the global geometrical property of the quantum potential , thus the quantum probability density as well .",
    "first , since the quantum probability density is vanishing at infinity , @xmath24 , non - negative and normalized , it must at least have one local maximum point .",
    "let us denote this maximum point by @xmath25 .",

    "now , let us put a local restriction on a class of quantum probability densities @xmath3 so that its maximum point stays at the minimum point of the quantum potential @xmath7 which it generates through eq .",

    "one therefore imposes @xmath30 dynamically we are thus looking for a class of quantum probability densities in which at least its maximum is temporally stable .",
    "next , let us show that the restrictions given by eqs .",
    "( [ stable stationary stochastic potential ] ) will uniquely determine the form of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "first , from the global scale invariant property of the quantum potential , then the quantum force is also global scaling invariance ; so that one has @xmath31 for any real constant @xmath16 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to write the quantum force to take the following non - trivial form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are arbitrary real number .",
    "evaluating at @xmath25 and using the fact of eq .",

    "one therefore has @xmath44    next , let us rewrite eq .",

    "we shall show later that @xmath7 can be interpreted as internal energy density . bearing this in mind , then the quantum probability density given in eq .",
    "( [ mbg canonical distribution ] ) resembles in form with the maxwell - boltzmann - gibbs ( mbg ) canonical distribution in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "it is thus suggestive to apply thermodynamics formalism to further study the property of quantum probability density given in eq .",

    "next , let us recall that in quantum mechanics @xmath3 gives the essential information on the position of the particle @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , in the ontological approach , @xmath3 is argued as the probability density that the particle is at @xmath1 regardless of any measurement .",
    "it is thus reasonable to quantify the randomness encoded in @xmath3 . one obvious way",

    "one can then show that the canonical quantum probability density of the form given in eq .",
