    "the energy landscape metaphor has turned theorists towards viewing the global geometry of the phase space of complex systems .",
    "when these systems are mesoscopic in size , for example , small proteins @xcite or gas phase clusters @xcite , a more or less complete mathematical formulation of the idea , capable of treating kinetics and thermodynamics , can be made using statistical tools to characterize minima and saddle points of the entire system .",
    "yet for macroscopic systems , most transitions rearrange particles only locally .",
    "this essential aspect of the dynamics is brought home forcefully by noting that a liter of liquid water will move from one energy minimum to another in @xmath0 sec .",
    "such a short time scale can not be directly relevant to any laboratory measurement on this system !",
    "the necessity for using a local description is clearly recognized in the modern theory of supercooled liquids and glasses which is based on the statistical mechanics of random first order transitions @xcite-@xcite . in the deeply supercooled liquid regime",
    "this theory explains not only the phenomenological features of the dynamics @xcite but quantitatively predicts , on a microscopic basis , the size of cooperative lengths , the precise non - arrhenius behavior of typical relaxation times @xcite and the non - exponentiality of relaxation @xcite . a quantized version of the theory explains the low temperature thermodynamics of amorphous substances , usually interpreted in terms of two level systems @xcite and the more energetic boson peak excitations @xcite . the crucial manifestation of the locality concept in this theory ( which has many mean field , global , aspects ) is the notion that `` entropic droplets '' drive the large - scale activated notions in glass forming liquids @xcite and give both liquids and glasses an intrinsic `` dynamical mosaic '' structure .    the main purpose of this paper is to describe the predictions of the rfot theory for the behavior of glasses that have fallen out of equilibrium because of being rapidly cooled from the melt .",
    "dynamics does not cease in rapidly quenched liquids that become glasses ; rather motions persist but are frustratingly slow and hard to study experimentally .",
    "this slow , far - from - equilibrium dynamics , called `` aging '' , is not only of fundamental interest for statistical mechanics @xcite but also is of great practical interest since so many amorphous materials are used in everyday life for times exceeding their preparation time @xcite",
    ". sometimes even small changes of properties upon aging are crucial to engineering performance .    like the quantum theory of the low temperature properties of glasses ,",
    "the description of the nonequilibrium aging regime requires the explicit construction and study of the energy landscape of local regions of the glass .",
    "this local energy landscape description turns out to be a microcanonical ensemble reformulation of the entropic droplet concept that was formulated originally in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we have found this microcanonical description to be more vivid and somewhat easier to communicate than the original canonical formulation . after introducing this formulation",
    "we will show that it indeed reproduces the results for the dynamics of equilibrated supercooled liquids already obtained using the random first order transition theory .",
    "more important , this local energy landscape theory makes several very striking predictions about the aging regime and how the aging dynamics in the nonequilibrium glass is related to the kinetics and thermodynamics of the equilibrated liquid .",
    "the predictions are consonant with all experiments known to us and make contact with , but are formally distinct from , the phenomenological approaches commonly used to describe aging in structural glasses @xcite .",
    "the present theory , for example , makes a specific prediction of the so - called nonlinearity parameter , @xmath1 , in the narayanaswamy - moynihan - tool , formalism @xcite .",
    "in addition , the degree of nonexponentiality of relaxation characterized by a @xmath2 exponent is predicted .",
    "@xmath2 turns out to be neither precisely fixed at @xmath3 nor does it precisely scale like the @xmath2 for an equilibrated liquid with @xmath4 , another assumption often made .",
    "the predicted variation of @xmath2 with quench temperature is however modest until very low temperatures are reached . likewise",
    "the adam - gibbs expression @xcite has been extended phenomenologically notably by hodge and scherer into the aging regime below @xmath3 by assuming the configurational entropy to be frozen at @xmath3 . while above @xmath3",
    ", an adam - gibbs like form of the temperature dependence of relaxation time is found from the present theory , below @xmath3 , the local energy landscape approach gives a different expression for the relaxation rate in an aging glass .",
    "quantitatively this expression gives relaxation rates close to the hodge - scherer - adam - gibbs ( hsag ) latter extrapolation but the local energy landscape theory predicts a deviation from that formula .",
    "this deviation would be interpreted within the hsag framework as a quench temperature dependence of the apparent configurational entropy .",
    "such a deviation has been found by alegria et al . in their careful work on aging of polymers @xcite .",
    "our most explicit results are obtained for the idealized situation of the aging initially found after a cooling history with a single rapid quench of modest depth .",
    "we will also qualitatively discuss modifications of the simple theory expected for very deep quenches .",
    "we also discuss the behavior of systems that have significantly relaxed in the quenched state .",
    "while , our analysis suggests that , to a first approximation , introducing a single fictive temperature should serve well to describe many quench histories , the local energy landscape theory shows that using a single fictive temperature is not exact .",
    "we suggest possible modifications of the usual aging kinematics based on the present theory .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we first describe how the local energy landscape view of entropic droplets can be visualized and show how a library of local energy landscapes can be constructed .",
    "we next show how to derive in this framework the ( previously obtained ) vogel - fulcher behavior above @xmath3 .",
    "we then present the results for typical relaxation rate for rapidly quenched , aging glasses and compare these predictions with experimental results .",
    "we then discuss the predictions for the stretching exponent both above and below @xmath3 . following this , the generalizations needed for very deeply quenched",
    "glasses and glasses that have undergone significant relaxation in the aging state are discussed .",
    "finally we summarize our theory and suggest some further experimental tests of it .",
    "the energy landscape language is usually applied to a small system ( protein or cluster ) .",
    "it is also used for a thermodynamically large system described by mean field theory @xcite . in the first situation ,",
    "the barriers between states are , of course , finite because the system is finite , but barriers may be formally infinite for the mean field system .",
    "the `` states '' for a cluster or a protein are often taken to be the basins surrounding minima of the potential energy @xcite .",
    "these are well defined and no transitions can occur , classically , between them at absolute zero .",
    "the `` states '' of a mean field system are tied to minima of free energy and again , owing to the @xmath5 barriers , no transition can occur between them ( even at finite @xmath4 ) .    in a supercooled liquid the observed plateau in the time dependent neutron scattering correlation function @xcite shows that most molecules spend a great deal of time vibrating about a given location .",
    "at least deep in the supercooled regime ( where the plateau is well developed ) we can , therefore , conceptually imagine constructing an average location for any particle about which it vibrates ( for times less than the plateau ) .",
    "the three dimensional structure based on these average locations will be quite close to a potential energy minimum found by removing kinetic energy from the system with infinite speed ( `` steepest descent '' to an `` inherent structure '' ) .",
    "a mean field theory of the glass transition can be obtained by constructing a free energy functional dependent on the ( plateau time averaged ) density and then noting that this functional has minima for density patterns localized around such inherent structures @xcite . in this way a vibrational component of the free energy can be defined and can be added to the average energy of such a state to give a free energy which determines the thermal probability of being in this state through the boltzmann law .",
    "free energy functionals only have such aperiodic minima below a temperature @xmath6 .",
    "this temperature has been shown ( within a simple approximation ) to be equivalent to the mode coupling dynamical transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the transition has the character of a spinodal for a first order phase transition @xcite . above @xmath6 even simple vibrational motions",
    "will take the system from one minimum to another , but below @xmath6 , the plateau in the time dependent structure factor indicates the persistence of such states and therefore their relevance to dynamics .",
    "in fact , as a first approximation , the persistence of these states allows them to act as a `` basis set '' for describing supercooled liquid dynamics .",
    "thus we say a free energy landscape emerges at @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath6 has been evaluated both for simple liquids @xcite and for models of network forming liquids with repulsive force @xcite from first principles .",
    "the physical meaning of the temperature @xmath6 is simple . when supecooled below its melting temperature @xmath7 , the liquid is , of course , in a metastable state as a whole , and therefore must be metastable _",
    "locally_. @xmath6 can be conveniently interpreted , for example , as a temperature below which every two molecules will spend a particular number ( say , 300 ) of vibrational periods together between the first encounter and the final departure .",
    "as part of our programme to describe the microscopics of liquid relaxations , we will show that transitions between the metastable configurations of the liquid _ as a whole _",
    "consists of transitions between _ local _ metastable configurations .",
    "we will employ a microcanonical procedure in which only local regions are considered and will find that beyond a certain ( relatively small ) size @xmath8 , the thermal and relaxational properties of the liquid do not depend on the size of the sample .",
    "alternatively said , all liquid properties of interest can be deduced by focusing on a liquid region of size @xmath8 and completely disregarding what the rest of the liquid is doing .",
    "this is the essence of the _ locality _ of the liquid free energy landscape .",
    "the microcanonical procedure is a necessary step in establishing such locality ; it is however rarely used , so let us first train our intuition on the very familiar example of a harmonic lattice .",
    "imagine being inside an extremely large , cubic , and purely harmonic lattice and being given the ability to do arbitrary thermodynamic measurement locally .",
    "you are further assigned to explain , within a formal model , those thermal measurements , but are allowed to visually inspect and mechanically test the _",
    "bonds _ with an arbitrarily large , but _ finite _ region , limited by how fast you can perform the inspection . upon checking that all individual bonds are truly harmonic and the lattice is cubic within a certain region ( of size @xmath9 ) , you write down a simple hamiltonian but are left with the issue of the conditions at the boundary - strictly speaking , the assignement is undoable !",
    "being an optimist , you say : let me _ assume _ for today that the rest of the sample is totally rigid ( fixed boundary conditions ) or does not exist at all ( open bondary condition ) and diagonalize the resulting hamiltonian ; tomorrow i can expand my horizon , repeat the procedure and see what happens .",
    "the first day proves frustrating though , because the hamiltonian has an energy gap ( proportional to @xmath10 ) , while the thermal measurements clearly show very low frequency excitations are present .",
    "fortunately , since ( unbeknownst to you ) the lattice was harmonic and periodic , your consecutive inspections and diagonalizations will yield a smaller and a smaller gap .",
    "clearly , the landscape of a regular harmonic lattice is non - local and the microcanonical procedure offers a definitive test of non - locality .",
    "consider yet another elementary notion : suppose you have a product of two hilbert spaces @xmath11 ( possibly interacting via @xmath12 ) with an energy @xmath13 assigned to configurations @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the subspaces @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "consider the partition function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are independent : @xmath20 , - one may further simplify @xmath21 . in either case , @xmath22 s are _ free _ energies of the degree of freedom @xmath17 , but can still be ( with advantage ) regarded as an energy , as far as the @xmath16 degree of freedom is concerned .",
    "for example , one is allowed to build a _",
    "microcanonical _ construction using @xmath22 s as the label . in the following , we will use a @xmath22-like quantity to describe _ all _ the degree of freedom in the supercooled ( or quenched ) liquid in excess of the lowest energy crystalline structure corresponding to this substance ( at this temperature ) .",
    "( for a polymer that does not form a crystal our results will still apply qualitatively . ) while the `` integrated out '' degrees of freedom @xmath17 are clearly related to the vibrations of the corresponding crystal structure , they are easy to conceptualize only in the mean field limit , where they are indeed harmonic vibrations ( see shortly ) .",
    "otherwise , the `` @xmath17 '' motions are strongly anharmonic .",
    "we are now ready construct a library of free energy minima for a very large sample of a liquid ( or glass ) .",
    "this spectrum is shown schematically in the first column of figure [ library ] as a function of the free energy of a state @xmath23 , @xmath24 which we take as the sum of an energy @xmath25 and an entropic contribution from vibrations within the basin @xmath26 .     in the upper panel on the left a global configuration",
    "is shown , chosen out of a global energy landscape .",
    "a region of @xmath27 particles in this configuration is rearranged in the center illustration .",
    "the original particle positions are indicated with dashed lines .",
    "a larger rearranged region involving @xmath28 particles is connected dynamically to these states and is shown on the right . in the lower panel ,",
    "the left most figure shows the huge density of states that is possible initially .",
    "the density of states found in the local library originating from a given initial state with 5 particles being allowed to move locally is shown in the second diagram .",
    "these energies are generally higher than the original state owing to the mismatch at the borders . the larger density of states where 7 particles are allowed to move is shown in the right most part of this panel . as the library grows in size ,",
    "the states as a whole are still found at higher energies but the width of the distribution grows . eventually with growing @xmath29 , a state within thermal reach of the initial state will be found . at this value of @xmath8",
    "we expect a region to be able to equilibrate . ]    because the system is very large this global library of states has an exceedingly dense spectrum , whose density dramatically increases with free energy .",
    "let us imagine the system is presently in one of these basins with ( free ) energy @xmath24 .",
    "we can now construct a set of _ local _ libraries of states . to do this , imagine mentally cutting out a region around a location @xmath30 containing @xmath29 particles , where @xmath29 is much less than the total number of particles in the sample . call this region @xmath31 .",
    "next , freeze the molecules outside this region but allow molecules within @xmath32 to move .",
    "( unlike in the cubic crystal analogy , a supecooled structure has built - in stress , so using open boundary condition is not useful . ) with the frozen environment one could ( by quenching the potential energy or a free energy functional ) find a new set of inherent structures that involve only reconfiguring the particles in @xmath32 .",
    "actually such a set of structures ( apart from strains near the surface of @xmath32 ) will locally resemble a subset of the original global library .",
    "if @xmath29 is small , however , we expect the subset of the states so sampled to be selected on average from a higher energy part of the global spectrum than where the original @xmath24 was found .",
    "essentially this is because the density of states rapidly increases with @xmath33 and there is less freedom to readjust particles in the constrained minimization problem because of the fixed environment . in absolute terms",
    ", we expect the discrepancy in energy of the mean energy of the states in any local library from the starting state to increase with @xmath29 since it is the particles at the borders that must be most strained .",
    "when @xmath29 is small the local library is sparse but it grows denser and spreads out over a larger range of free energy as the size of the region increases .",
    "the set of such libraries centered around @xmath30 is shown also in figure [ library ] for @xmath34 up to a large value of @xmath29 .",
    "the number of states in the library at free energy @xmath35 determines the configurational entropy @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the competition between the average energy growth and the spreading of the range of energies with size of the region means that there is a characteristic size @xmath8 where a state will finally be found within thermal energy of the starting state .",
    "@xmath8 turns out to be the size of a dynamically correlated region in the liquid or glass .",
    "since the new configuration is within @xmath38 of the starting state , a transition of such a region from its original configuration to the new state can occur with reasonable probability .",
    "the region after reconfiguration will be characterized by a temperature @xmath4 .",
    "elementary transitions in the liquid must leave most of the molecules near their old locations - this is the dynamical essence of locality . therefore the local landscape libraries are locally connected to each other : in order to re - arrange a large region , smaller regions located in the same place",
    "must first be rearranged .",
    "the specific law connecting states in neighboring libraries must obey detailed balance ( at the vibrational temperature @xmath4 ) but otherwise will depend specifically on molecular details for each system .",
    "the additional activation energy , for a downhill move in such a library should only be a few times the energy needed to heat a particle to @xmath6 , the dynamical transition temperature .",
    "irrespective of the detailed motions allowed , the locality of the dynamics , however , guarantees that the transitions from the initial state to one of the thermally allowed states in the library for @xmath39 will nevertheless be slow : owing to the initial rise of the average energy there will be a bottleneck in the probability flux at an intermediate value of @xmath29 , namely @xmath40 .",
    "the activation free energy for reaching this bottleneck state determines the escape rate from the initial configuration by motions in the vicinity of @xmath30 .",
    "while the local libraries can be constructed explicitly given sufficient computational resources , the rfot theory suggests a useful set of approximations to the statistics of these libraries when @xmath8 and @xmath40 are moderately large .",
    "we now describe these approximations : we ascribe to each state @xmath41 of the library for a region @xmath31 a so - called bulk free energy @xmath42",
    ". naively this would be the sum of the vibrational entropies and internal energies of each molecule in @xmath32 and the pair interactions between the molecules within @xmath32 .",
    "( rigor here would require ensuring the appropriate finite ranges of interactions and some precisely specified ways of partitioning vibrational entropies : entanglement entropies of the interface are too subtle for consideration at present ) . note that in a system with a globally correlated landscape , such as the harmonic lattice considered earlier , a description in terms of local libraries will not provide the full list of configurations available to the system as a whole .    in a similar way we would define a bulk free energy of the initial state relevant to this region @xmath43 .",
    "the actual energy of the complete sample when the state @xmath41 is inserted in region @xmath31 will not just reflect the difference in the bulk energies corresponding to the state @xmath41 and the initial state ; instead , it will be higher by an amount @xmath44 : @xmath45    as mentioned earlier , the new local structure labelled by @xmath46 , is likely to be higher in energy than the initial configuration .",
    "our construction thus suggests @xmath44 will usually be positive and will at most scale with the interface area .",
    "we will write @xmath47 . as we shall see later",
    "the estimate for the exponent @xmath48 in 3 dimensions , based solely on the interface area , is probably naive near @xmath3 .",
    "we now wish to calculate the equilibration rate of the region @xmath49 . if the environment remains frozen , this rate is the escape rate from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "the probability flux to increase @xmath29 falls until the bottleneck value @xmath40 is reached .",
    "after @xmath40 , even though the average energy of states in the libraries increases , the growth of the number of states with increasing library size is sufficient so that a rapid path to a thermally equilibrated state at size @xmath8 can be found . let the typical downhill microscopic rearrangment have a rate @xmath52 .",
    "this rate will only be weakly activated .",
    "the flux to any state at a size @xmath29 smaller than @xmath8 will be @xmath53 where @xmath54 maximizes the integrand and @xmath55 is some constant of units energy .",
    "the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath56 are related through eq.([phi_j ] ) .",
    "this maximization means @xmath54 will be the internal free energy characteristic of the system at the ambient ( i.e. vibrational ) temperature @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath54 is the sum of the energetic and vibrational entropic contributions appropriate to equilibrium at @xmath4 .",
    "in essence , the equation above is nothing more than the rate of escape through a transition state with non - zero entropy , hence a structure resembling the canonical ensemble . aside from a numerical factor , the integration in eq.([k ] ) is indeed a canonical summation in terms of @xmath57 , which should be regarded as the non - meanfield analog of the free energy of the so called `` pure '' state .",
    "the concept of the pure state is well developed in the context of frustrated mean - field spin systems @xcite . in the mean - field limit ,",
    "the pure states are separated by infinite barriers and thus the vibrations around the metastable free energy minima are purely harmonic .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is non - meanfield because it can be defined only locally ( after paying the `` price '' of the surface energy @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is the degrees of freedom due to transitions between those ( non - meanfield ) `` pure '' states of the liquid that give rise to the ( measurable ) configurational entropy .",
    "note also that owing to the intense and strongly anharmonic motions in the liquid ( at this finite @xmath4 ) , a local liquid state labelled by a particular value of @xmath33 is not a single inherent structure @xcite , but rather is a weighted superposition of many inherent structures , with more or less harmonic vibrations on top .",
    "note , @xmath54 is a function of @xmath4 and @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath58 is the equilibrium bulk free energy at temperature @xmath4 , one may replace @xmath59 by its equilibrium value at that temperature @xmath60 .",
    "thus we get for the escape rate to @xmath29 the result @xmath61 the location of the bottleneck is determined by the minimum of this expression over @xmath29 .",
    "we can thus define an activation free energy @xmath62 whose maximum defines the bottleneck location .",
    "notice this activation barrier depends on the total free energy of having any target state at size @xmath29 and the initial nonequilibrated particular state free energy @xmath63 in which we only include a vibrational contribution and no configurational entropy .",
    "this function is shown in fig.[profiles ] .",
    "the free energy to reconfigure the initial configuration is shown as a function of the size of the locally rearranged region .",
    "there will be fluctuations in the shape owing to the detailed packing found in the initial configuration but on the average the profile is given by equation ( [ f(n)fluc ] ) in the text .",
    "the dashed curve shows the profile for an initial state which is much higher than the equilibrium energy at @xmath4 , while the solid curve is the free energy profile for an initially equilibrated state . ]    introducing eq.([phi_j ] ) into eq.([f_phi ] ) yields : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total equilibrium free energy that includes both the configurational entropy of the region of size @xmath29 and the internal bulk free energy with its vibrational contribution . in this expression",
    "we have substituted the average mismatch energy coefficient @xmath66 , for the state specific values . for dynamically connected states @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath60 grow linearly with @xmath29 .",
    "there will also be @xmath69 , an additional fluctuation that typically scales as @xmath70 .",
    "thus we write @xmath71 n + \\gamma n^x + \\delta f , \\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the total bulk free energy per particle of the final state at temperature @xmath4 and @xmath73 is the internal free energy per particle of the initial state . in the following",
    ", we will omit the fluctuation term @xmath69 , whenever computing the most probable barrier , but will consider it explicitly when estimating the degree of non - exponentiality of the relaxation , which is directly related to the barrier fluctuations .",
    "note , the expression above is simply what would be prescribed by a regular nucleation theory for the free energy barrier of conversion from a ( usually non - equilibrium ) initial state to the other ( usually equilibrium ) state .",
    "clearly , when the initial state is at equilibrium : @xmath74 , - the `` free energy '' driving force @xmath75 is equal to @xmath76 , i.e. there is still relaxation in the supercooled liquid , as driven by conversion between alternative ( local ) aperiodic packings of the liquid . in general",
    ", the maximum of the typical @xmath77 occurs at @xmath40 such that @xmath78 vanishes giving @xmath79 and a typical ( most probable ) rate @xmath80    we finish this section by elaborating on why the relaxations occuring with the rate from eq.([k(x ) ] ) can occur with a zero free energy gap thus leading to a local free energy landscape .",
    "consider first a supercooled liquid at equilibrium ( i.e. not quenched ) : @xmath81 .",
    "clearly the size @xmath8 at which @xmath82 corresponds to the same liquid state , therefore a region of size @xmath8 can survey _ all _ liquid configurations typical of this temperature .",
    "an isoenergetic state exists because the system resides in a metastable state much higher than the lowest energy crystalline arrangement , as reflected in non - zero configurational entropy @xmath83 , and the very high density of states @xmath84 .",
    "( note , this notion underlies the existence of residual structural degrees of freedom in glasses even at cryogenic temperatures @xcite . )",
    "if the liquid is quenched and aging , the driving force @xmath85 is still negative ( it will be computed shortly ) , so both quantities @xmath40 and @xmath8 exist and are comparable to their equilibrium values , although @xmath8 no longer signifies straightforwardly the degree of the landscape locality ( consistent with the system being out of equilibrium in the first place ) .",
    "regardless , relaxations are local during aging too .",
    "examining the expressions for the relaxation rate for an equilibrium sample makes explicit the connection to the earlier form of the entropic droplet idea . in the equilibrated sample case , the internal vibrational free energies of the initial and final states are the same so the driving force to distinct equilibrated configurations comes only from the configurational entropy contribution available at the equilibrium temperature .",
    "people are sometimes confused how configurational entropy , which is never made available in a strict mean field scenario , can drive a transition event .",
    "this is because of the locality of the landscape in the droplet analysis , which goes beyond meanfield thinking .",
    "locally , for a region of space @xmath86 there is a `` funnel '' of states leading away from the initial configuration to other equally equilibrated configurations .",
    "configurational entropy drives the activated motions of the local regions of a glass in the same way the entropy arising from the large number of denatured configurations of a protein drives the unfolding of a folded native protein even though the denatured states are individually higher in energy @xcite .",
    "any individual escape path is likely to find a big barrier but this barrier is partially cancelled by the growth of the number of escape routes .",
    "the free energies along each path fluctuate thus increasing the likelihood of finding a low energy path , when a large number of paths is available . as the entropy per particle",
    ", @xmath87 gets smaller the driving force to re - equilibrate falls so the critically activated region of the glass necessary for re - equilibration grows larger and the rate falls , owing to the larger activation barrier from the mismatch contribution .",
    "the precise way this happens depends on the mismatch energy and its exponent @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , before proceeding to study the nonequilibrium situation , we digress to discuss aspects of the average mismatch energy @xmath89 which we have approximated as @xmath90 .",
    "first it is clear that the form of @xmath90 is only a crude approximation to the mismatch energy when @xmath29 is small . in principle ,",
    "recall , the mismatch energy could be explicitly computed by carrying out the local library construction on a computer .",
    "the only problem is obtaining initial configurations equilibrated to the appropriate low temperatures .",
    "finding such equilibrated configurations deep in the landscape currently requires heroic computer resources .",
    "therefore the mismatch energy must presently be inferred by analytical considerations .",
    "the simplest free energy functional calculations of the mismatch energy gives an energy proportional to the interface area and therefore gives the mismatch exponent @xmath48 .",
    "such simplified calculations also give an explicit value of the prefactor of the scaling relation , @xmath91 at the ideal glass transition temperature , @xmath92 . at this temperature , the lost interaction terms of a sharp interface have to balance the entropy cost of localizing each particle to its cage .",
    "this gives , at @xmath92 @xcite , @xmath93,\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the mean square fluctuations of particles in a given basin @xcite and @xmath95 is the interparticle spacing .",
    "the ratio @xmath96 is about 0.1 for glassy configurations , just as it is in the lindemann criterion for melting .",
    "calculations based on free energy functional show that @xmath66 vanishes as @xmath6 is approached from below @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath6 resembles a spinodal . from these estimates ,",
    "@xmath97 can be obtained @xcite .",
    "these naive mean field estimates would give an activation barrier varying as @xmath98 , as first detailed by kirkpatrick and wolynes @xcite and later discussed by parisi @xcite .",
    "kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes pointed out an effect left out in the naive estimate of the mismatch energy @xcite : one must acknowledge there are numerous solutions of the mean field equations describing minima of the free energy functional , these precisely correspond to our local energy landscape libraries . in principle",
    "some of these other configurations can be interpolated between the internal target state to which the region is relaxing and its fixed environment in order to lower the mismatch energy .",
    "this interpolation is called `` wetting '' .    such wetting",
    "only can be rigorously defined for very large @xmath29 .",
    "wetting is a dynamical process that takes some time to develop .",
    "we should therefore for greater accuracy ascribe a frequency dependence to the mismatch surface tension @xmath99 .",
    "the mapping between the free energy functional and the random field ising model allows us to invoke an argument of villain @xcite that gives a curvature dependence to the surface tension coefficient @xmath100 in three dimensions where @xmath95 is the microscopic length where the surface tension @xmath91 is established ( @xmath101 ) .",

    "nevertheless , line - like defects may either traverse the correlated region directly or wander across the region like a brownian path .",
    "the line length in the first case of `` ballistic '' traversal should scale like @xmath110 while in the brownian case the length is proportional to square of the traversed distance so we expect the mismatch energy to scale like @xmath111 , resembling the mean field result without wetting .",

    ". the unimodal distribution with a single fictive temperature should be quite safe if @xmath185 .",
    "for @xmath3 relevant to 1 hr .",
    "quenches this gives @xmath186 .",
    "most of the alegria et al .",
    "@xcite data lie in this modest quenching range , while `` hyperquenched '' samples ( with @xmath187 ) will often fall outside the allowed range of using a single fictive temperature .",
    "when a sample has a two peaked distribution of local energies , an ultra - slow component of relaxation will arise .",
    "notice that an equilibrated region at the temperature @xmath188 will relax on the tens to hundreds of hours scale ( using the relation that @xmath189 ) , if @xmath190 is taken to be one hour .",
    "percolation of the ultra slow regions will lead to the possibility of observing multiple length scales . ]",
    "the nature of the new statistics , after some transitions occur and substantial aging has progressed , depends on how big is the difference between the typical current energy of a region and the target equilibrium energy .",
    "if the gap is big , a two peaked structure in the distribution of local bulk energies will develop and the statistics will be far from gaussian : some regions that are newly equilibrated will relax further at a ( slower ) rate characteristic of equilibrium at @xmath4 , while the other , not yet transformed regions will still relax at the faster nonequilibrium rate discussed already .",
    "such a situation , if it arises , might account for `` ultra - slow '' relaxations which have occasionally been reported in aging studies @xcite ( see the figure [ inhomt ] caption for a criterion for such behavior ) .",
    "the statistics in this case of very deep quenches studied for very long times is very complex kinematically .",
    "two peaked distributions of local energies may also arise if the system is abruptly but briefly heated from a low temperature state to a much higher one .",
    "fortunately in the more usual situation of modest monotonic quenches we can expect the distribution of local energies to remain unimodal .",
    "in such cases , to first order then the distribution will be characterized by a mean bulk energy per particle @xmath191 ! if the ambient temperature were to remain fixed , @xmath191 should relax to @xmath192 since at that point detailed balance applied to the microscopic rates will replenish any states from which the system locally escapes .",
    "( we remind the reader that @xmath193 denotes a ( library ) free energy @xmath33 without the vibrational entropy contribution . ) the typical escape rate at any value of @xmath191 will be given by eq.([k(x)g ] ) at ambient temperature @xmath4 .",
    "thus the equation of motion for will @xmath191 have the form    @xmath194 ) \\ :",
    "\\{\\bar{\\epsilon}(t_1 ) - \\epsilon_{eq}[t(t_1)]\\}.\\ ] ]    where @xmath195 is the relaxation function when the statistics of libraries are known and fixed by @xmath196 , @xmath197 is the ambient temperature at time @xmath198 - we assume vibrational energies equilibrate quickly by thermal conduction . @xmath195",
    "not only depends on @xmath197 and @xmath191 but contains the parameter @xmath2 which in turn depends on the variance of energies of the local region .",
    "as a first approximation the variance can be taken as that characteristic of an equilibrium system at a temperature @xmath199 such that @xmath200 in this approximation , we may use eq.([beta_ratio ] ) for @xmath201.\\ ] ] we see that if the shape of the distribution of local libraries does not change much , the rfot picture leads to a situation where a single parameter @xmath191 suffices to characterize the system .",
    "@xmath202 thus essentially fixes the `` fictive temperature '' @xmath122 in the ntm phenomenology , albeit with different expressions for @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "the non - gaussian statistics alluded to earlier , however suggests the use of a single fictive temperature is only approximate and that a more complete characterization of the statistics may be needed .",
    "multiple fictive temperatures defining the higher moments could in principle be defined .",
    "in addition spatial fluctuations of fictive temperatures are needed to capture the co - existence of equilibrated and nonequilibrated domains in the mosaic structure . at least for moderate quenches",
    "it may be possible to ignore the spatial inhomogenity and merely monitor the fluctuations in energies of domains as a secondary variable .",
    "we described a local energy landscape theory of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and glasses . in the equilibrated supercooled regime",
    "this theory is just a microcanonical ensemble reformulation of the random first order transition theory and its notion of entropic droplets .",
    "new results are obtained in the aging regime of nonequilibrium quenched glasses .",
    "the key equation is ( [ k(x)g ] ) which shows it is the difference between the equilibrated free energy at the quench temperature and the initial free energy of the particular frozen state that drives motions .",
    "the theory approximately reproduces the phenomenology of narayanaswamy and moynihan and tool .",
    "thus the nonlinearity parameter in nmt theory can be calculated .",
    "this parameter is shown to be correlated with the supercooled liquid s fragility in agreement with experiment .",
    "this correlation is quantitatively very similar to that obtained by the hodge - scherer - adam - gibbs extrapolation that assumes configurational entropy is fixed at @xmath3 .",
    "deviations from that extrapolation which assumes arrhenius behavior in the glassy state are predicted however .",
    "the previously puzzling , modest non - arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation observed within the glassy state is explained by the rfot theory , although it is a small effect .",
    "the variations of nonexponentiality of relaxation in the glassy state are predicted but are also rather small in the moderately quenched regime .",
    "the comparison of nonexponentiality with experiment is less conclusive than the comparison of mean relaxation rates however , owing to the difficulty of accessing the complete relaxation behavior during the quench .",
    "one advantage of the aging theory based on rfot theory is that in principle the behavior upon very deep quenches is predicted .",
    "most importantly @xmath2 is predicted to continue to decrease with quench temperature .",
    "we hope that more experiments in this regime will be done .",
    "we have noted however that some non - universal effects may enter for such quenches .",
    "also the kinematics of deep quenches may be complex owing to spatial fluctuations of fictive temperature predicted by our theory .",
    "although the present approach justifies to some extent the use of a single fictive temperature to characterize the glassy state the limitations of this idea have been made clear .",
    "a straightforward extension of the usual formulation to include fluctuations in the moderately cooled regime more fully was proposed . in the strongly cooled regime ,",
    "the theory predicts patches of especially slowly relaxing regions will appear .",
    "this prediction may be tested by single molecule imaging approaches @xcite .",
