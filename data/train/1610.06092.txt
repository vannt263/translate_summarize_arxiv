    "parsimonious individual - based models have been commonly used to describe collective social phenomena for more than four decades  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "statistical physics models have proven especially well - suited to reveal the micro - macro connections in social dynamics and to help reveal the relationships existing between phenomena appearing across disciplines ( like biology , ecology , economics )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the voter model ( vm )  @xcite serves as a reference to describe the evolution of opinions in interacting populations  @xcite .",
    "it is however well established that the vm is built on a number of oversimplified assumptions : for instance , the vm considers that all voters are similar : in the absence of any self - confidence , they change their their opinion by imitating neighbors .",
    "this mechanism of _ conformity by imitation _ does not allow to maintain social diversity in the long run , but always leads to a consensus .",
    "however , social scientists have shown that the collective dynamics of a society greatly depends on the different responses to stimuli by the members of a society  @xcite . a simple way to accommodate a population with different levels of confidence",
    "is simply to assume that some agents are `` zealots '' and either favor one opinion  @xcite or inflexibly maintain a fixed opinion  @xcite . since the introduction of zealots in the vm ,",
    "the effect of zealotry has been studied in other models of social dynamics  @xcite and in various contexts  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the so - called two - state nonlinear @xmath0-voter model ( @xmath0vm )  @xcite . in this variant of the vm , that has received much attention recently  @xcite ,",
    "each voter can be influenced by a group of @xmath0 neighbors   .",
    "this mimics the fact that group pressure is known to influence the degree of conformity , especially above a group size threshold  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , social scientists have shown that conformity via imitation is a driving mechanism for collective actions that is influenced by the size of social groups , and they also found that conformity can be seriously deflected by individuals ( like zealots ) that are able to resist group pressure  @xcite",
    ". motivated by these considerations  @xcite , the basic features of the @xmath0vm and zealotry have recently been combined in the @xmath0-voter model with inflexible zealots ( @xmath0vmz )  @xcite and in a heterogeneous counterpart model , called the 2@xmath0vz , in which two subgroups of susceptible voters interacting with their neighbors with different @xmath0 s : namely , with @xmath6  @xcite .    in the @xmath0vmz and 2@xmath0vz ,",
    "group - size limited conformity and zealotry are accounted for , and zealots significantly tame the level of social conformity in the population  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of the @xmath0vmz and 2@xmath0vz in a well - mixed population is similar and is characterized by two phases as in systems in thermal equilibrium : below a critical level of zealotry , the opinion distribution transitions from single - peaked becomes bimodal and , in finite populations , the dynamics is characterized by the fluctuation - driven switching between two states  @xcite . yet , while the @xmath0vmz of ref .",
    "@xcite obeys detailed balance and its stationary distribution can be obtained exactly , this is not the case of the 2@xmath0vz even in the simple case of a well - mixed population when the system relaxes into a non - equilibrium steady state ( ness )  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the 2@xmath0vz does not obey detailed balance has many important statistical physics consequences : there is generally no simple way to obtain the ness distribution  @xcite , while persistent probability currents are responsible for subtle oscillations and non - trivial correlation functions  @xcite . from a social dynamics viewpoint ,",
    "the composition of the society being very heterogeneous , it would be relevant to consider models with a distribution of @xmath0 s that would reflect different responses to multiple social stimuli  @xcite .",
    "while analytical progress appears to be difficult in such a general case , much can be learnt about the influence of being out - of - equilibrium on the social dynamics by considering the simple 2@xmath0vz whose detailed analysis is presented here .",
    "in particular , we are able to show that susceptible voters with smaller @xmath0 change their opinion more quickly and drive those in the other subgroup , and directed , yet subtle , _ oscillations _ associated with fluctuating quantities can be measured  .    in this work ,",
    "we therefore focus on the 2@xmath0vz and characterize the properties of its ness in terms of the master equation , stochastic simulations and continuum approximations based on mean - field and fokker - planck equations . while a brief account of some of these features was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we considerably generalize that study and also investigate the switching dynamics of the 2@xmath0vz .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : the details of the 2@xmath0vz are specified in the next section , along with the underlying master equation .",
    "the microscopic characterization of the ness in terms of the master equation and relevant observables is addressed in sec .",
    "iv is dedicated to the continuum approximation of the @xmath7vz dynamics in terms of mean - field rate equations and through a linear gaussian approximation ( lga ) of the underlying fokker - planck equation ( for a system of large but finite size )   @xcite .",
    "this allows us to show in some details , how the the lga offers the best insight into probability currents and their manifestations in the @xmath7vz s ness far from criticality , as explained in sec .",
    "iv.b . in sec .",
    "iv.c , we exploit a fokker - planck formulation to shed light on the switching time properties of the 2@xmath0vz via approximate mappings onto the @xmath0vmz whereas the behavior near criticality is briefly discussed in sec .  iv.d .",
    "while most examples given in section iv are concerned with the case of symmetric zealotry ( same number of zealots for each party ) , the generalization to asymmetric zealotry is addressed in sec .",
    "v. we also give a number of analytical and computational details in a series of appendices .",
    "we end with a summary , as well as outlook for future research .",
    "it is worth noting that while our general analysis applies to any values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality , the numerical examples reported in our figures have been obtained for @xmath8 .",
    "the 2@xmath0vz consists of a population of @xmath9 voters who hold one of two opinions , denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "a fraction of the population are inflexible zealots that never change their opinion  @xcite , the number of which are denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the remaining population consists of @xmath12 swing voters of two types , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( known as @xmath15-susceptibles , @xmath4 ) : @xmath16 of the swing voters are of type @xmath1 and there are @xmath17 swing voters of type @xmath2 . in our model ,",
    "the behavior of each voter is fixed , so that @xmath11 and @xmath18 are conserved , with @xmath19 . as illustrated in fig .",

    "if the focal voter is a @xmath15-susceptible is chosen however , then it the opinions of a random group of @xmath15 of its neighbors ( repetition is allowed ) are collected .",
    "( c ) if the @xmath15 neighbors have the same opinion that differs from that of the focal voter , the latter adopts the opinion of the group . if there is no consensus within the @xmath15-group , the opinion of the focal voter does not change . here ,",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider a well - mixed population , i.e. each voter can be thought to as the @xmath9 nodes of a complete graph and all other voters are neighbors .      in the absence of explicit spatial structure ,",
    "the configuration space is a discrete set of @xmath20 points and the system state is completely specified by the pair @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of susceptible voters of type @xmath23 holding the opinion @xmath24 . in each update attempt , the system may , or may not , step to one of its four nearest neighboring points . in other words the allowed _ changes",
    "_ are in the set @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we may regard the evolution of the 2@xmath0vz as a two - dimensional random walker with inhomogeneous and biased rates .",
    "such a stochastic process can be readily described by a master equation ( me ) for the evolution of @xmath28 , the probability of finding the system in state @xmath29 after @xmath30 discrete time steps ( or update attempts ) from starting in an initial configuration @xmath31 .",

    "@xcite , we emphasized a distinctive feature of the 2@xmath0vz , namely , that its dynamics is a genuine out - of - equilibrium type , contrary to the @xmath0vmz  @xcite model .",
    "hence , detailed balance and time reversal symmetry are violated in the 2@xmath0vz .",
    "to establish this fact , we apply the kolmogorov criterion ( [ kol ] )  @xcite on a closed loop consisting of the four @xmath29 s around a square : @xmath57 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : detailedbalance ] .",

    "thus , the dynamics of our 2@xmath0vz violates the detailed balance . of course , setting @xmath62 we recover the @xmath0vmz , for which the above ratio is always unity , confirming that the single-@xmath0 case of ref .",

    "violation of detailed balance has a number of consequences on the behavior of a system .",
    "these will be scrutinized in the next sections . in particular",

    "( [ eqn : me ] ) , we see that it is the ( right ) eigenvector of @xmath65  with unit eigenvalue",
    ". meanwhile , the joint distribution in this state will be homogeneous in time and so , depends only on the difference @xmath66",
    "as summarized in appendix  [ app : appendixa ] , a significant consequence of detailed balance violation is that the system relaxes into a _",

    "further , due to the absence of time reversal , this ness is characterized by non - vanishing probability currents  @xcite .",
    "though _ net _ currents may flow between any two configurations in general , here they exist only between nearest neighbors , e.g. , from @xmath29 to @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we can denote it by a vector field @xmath70 , the components being@xmath71note that @xmath72 is also the net current from @xmath29 to @xmath73 . in a ness ,",

    "on the discrete @xmath20 lattice , any closed loop can be regarded as the sum of elementary loops , each around a square ( plaquette ) .",

    "apart from the vorticity , it is useful to characterize a divergence free vector field as the curl of another .",

    "however , again , a major difference between the 2@xmath0vz and the @xmath0vmz is that the former violates the detailed balance which results in the steady state being a ness and in a number of intriguing results such as the existence of stationary current of probability that form closed loops in the configuration space .",

    "the stationary current probability @xmath399 flows mostly around @xmath397 in a anti - clockwise fashion ( vorticity is positive ) , even though there is current flow around @xmath402 but with a much smaller amplitude .",

    "the mean time for the transition @xmath402 to @xmath397 can be estimated by using the same approach as in the case of symmetric zealotry and also gives a mean time that grows exponentially with the population size , which is typical of a system characterized by metastability .",
