    "this is the first in a series of papers regarding the identification and characterization of groups of young stars within a few hundred pc of the sun ( mostly , newly discovered groups of young stars ) . the second paper ( mamajek , in prep .",
    ") will detail the identification of a new @xmath420-myr - old group within 100pc . in this contribution ,",
    "i discuss a new candidate group situated 170pc away in ophiuchus that appears to be similar in age to the pleiades ( @xmath7120 myr ) .",
    "very young stars with ages of @xmath83myr are usually found in embedded clusters ( ecs ) with tens to hundreds of members , and associated with dark molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the vast majority of embedded clusters must not remain as bound structures identifiable as open clusters ( ocs ) after their molecular gas is removed .",
    "this can be inferred by estimating the formation rates of the local samples of ecs and ocs within 1 kpc of the sun . in comparing the number of ecs to ocs within the same representative volume , and assuming a constant cluster - formation rate , @xcite",
    "calculate that @xmath84 - 7% of embedded star clusters probably survive to the age of the pleiades ( @xmath7130 myr ) .",
    "counting only those ecs with @xmath935 members from the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite within 1 kpc of the sun , the local surface density of ecs in the galactic disk appears to be @xmath49 kpc@xmath10 .",
    "the number of ecs with 10 - 35 members is roughly equal to the number of ecs with @xmath1135 members @xcite , so the surface density is doubled if one counts groups with @xmath1110 members . assuming a flat cluster - formation rate , and a mean ec age of @xmath42myr , @xcite estimate for their sample of local ecs with @xmath1135 members a formation rate of @xmath44 myr@xmath12 kpc@xmath10 . if one assumes that the census of ocs with ages of 10 - 100myr and @xmath0 @xmath13 1kpc is complete ( using the 2006 updatewilton/ ] of the catalog of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the local density of such ocs is @xmath435kpc@xmath10 , and the oc formation rate is @xmath40.34 myr@xmath12 kpc@xmath10 ( similar to previous estimates by @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". the actual cluster formation rate may be somewhat higher as nearby clusters are still being discovered @xcite .",
    "these calculations suggest that only @xmath49% of the ecs seen today would be hypothetically identified as ocs @xmath410 - 100 myr in the future , and that @xmath490% of ecs likely evolve into unbound structures that might be identifiable as `` associations '' or `` moving groups '' .",
    "another conclusion is that for every cataloged oc in the sun s vicinity with age @xmath14100myr , there may be an _ order of magnitude _ more stellar aggregates with @xmath1135 members that are _ not _ cataloged as ocs , and there are likely to be approximately _",
    "double _ that number again if one tracks the evolution of ecs with @xmath1110 members .",
    "so where are these fossil remnants of ecs that are predicted to be in copious supply ?    the nearest unbound remnants of ecs that contain any o - type stars , and/or significant numbers of b - type stars , have probably been identified as ob associations ( obas ) , at least up until ages of few@xmath1510 myr @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of obas were probably giant molecular cloud complexes containing ensembles of ecs ( with the evolutionary descendants of the individual ecs appearing later as `` subgroups '' in the obas ) .",
    "the ob associations within 1 kpc cataloged by @xcite contain between 6 and 85 b - type stars ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "young stellar groups with ages of @xmath43 - 100 myr that contain few , if any , b - type stars have only recently been identified .",
    "given a standard initial mass function ( imf ) , one naively expects that for each b - type star formed , an ec will also typically produce @xmath41 a - star , @xmath41 f - star , @xmath41.5 g - stars , @xmath44 k - stars , and @xmath428 m - stars ( where i have adopted the imf of * ? ? ? * and the spectral types are reflective of the resultant main sequence population ) . hence ,",
    "if born with a @xcite imf , an unrecognized cluster or association with @xmath45 b - type stars may have represented an embedded cluster of @xmath4200stars . that such small groups can escape detection is well illustrated by that fact that at least 5 well - studied stellar aggregates with ages of @xmath830myr and distances of @xmath8110 pc have been discovered over the past decade ( e.g. @xmath17 cha , @xmath18 cha , tw hya , @xmath19 pic , tuc - hor groups ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and an x - ray all - sky survey ( i.e. _ rosat _ ; * ? ? ?",

    "the low - mass members of such groups may be identifiable by virtue of various youth signatures , with strong x - ray emission being the most conspicuous .",
    "the most unbound aggregates may even lack a distinguishable nucleus ( e.g. tw hya association ) , and may simply be identifiable as a slight over - density of young stars of similar age and space motion .",
    "in an effort to further investigate the memberships and kinematics of known young , nearby stellar associations , as well as identify new ones , the author has compiled an extensive list of astrometric data for a sample of plausibly young stars within a few hundred pc of the sun .",

    "the group s one - dimensional velocity dispersion is unresolvable with the best available long baseline proper motion data , consistent with the minuscule value predicted from dynamical considerations ( @xmath40.2kms@xmath12 ) .",
    "roughly half of the group s observed stellar mass ( @xmath724@xmath52 ) appears to be concentrated within a nucleus with half - mass radius of @xmath78 @xmath1 0.4pc .",
    "a kinematic analysis of the proper motion components pointing towards the group convergent point suggests that the intrinsic scatter in the distances to the individual group members is probably of order @xmath345pc , similar in size to the inferred tidal radius ( 4pc ) .",
    "if the census of 1.5 - 5.5@xmath52 members is complete , and the group formed with a normal initial mass function , then the initial population of the new group may have been of order @xmath4200 systems .",
    "the space motion and age of the group are similar to that of the pleiades , @xmath5 per cluster , and ab dor moving group , suggesting that these entities may have formed in the same complex some @xmath410@xmath6 yr ago .",
