    "the pioneering study on scalar - tensor theories was done by brans and dicke several decades ago who sought to incorporate mach s principle into gravity @xcite . according to brans - dicke ( bd )",
    "theory the phenomenon of inertia arises from accelerations with respect to the general mass distribution of the universe .",
    "this theory can be regarded as an economic modification of general relativity which accomodates both mach s principle and dirac s large number hypothesis as new ingredients .",
    "there has been a renewed interest in studying bd theory ever since it has been disclosed that bd theory appears naturally in the low energy limit of superstring theory . in string theory , gravity becomes scalar - tensor in nature .",
    "the low - energy effective action of the string theory leads to the einstein gravity , coupled non - minimally to a scalar dilaton field .",
    "besides , recent observations show that at the present epoch , our universe expands with acceleration instead of deceleration along the scheme of standard friedmann models and since general relativity could not describe such universe correctly , cosmologists have attended to alternative theories of gravity such as bd theory . due to highly nonlinear character of bd theory ,",
    "a desirable pre - requisite for studying strong field situation is to have knowledge of exact explicit solutions of the field equations .",
    "since black holes are very important both in classical and quantum gravity , many authors have investigated various aspects of them in bd theory @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the dynamic scalar field in the bd theory plays an important role in the process of collapse and critical phenomenon .",
    "the first four - dimensional black hole solutions of bd theory was obtained by brans in four classes @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that among these four classes of the static spherically symmetric solutions of the vacuum bd theory of gravity only two are really independent , and only one of them is permitted for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "it has been proved that in four dimensions , the stationary and vacuum bd solution is just the kerr solution with constant scalar field everywhere @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the charged black hole solution in four - dimensional brans - dicke - maxwell ( bdm ) theory is just the reissner - nordstrom solution with a constant scalar field , however , in higher dimensions , one obtains the black hole solutions with a nontrivial scalar field @xcite .",
    "this is because the stress energy tensor of maxwell field is not traceless in the higher dimensions and the action of maxwell field is not invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "accordingly , the maxwell field can be regarded as the source of the scalar field in the bd theory @xcite .",
    "the properties of charged black hole solutions in dilaton gravity @xcite and bd theory @xcite have been explored by many authors .",
    "however , these solutions @xcite are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti)-de sitter [ ( a)ds ] .",
    "recently , the dilaton potential leading to ( a)ds - like solutions of dilaton gravity has been found @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the cosmological constant is coupled to the dilaton in a very nontrivial way .",

    "we also want to perform a stability analysis and investigate the effect of the scalar field on the thermal stability of the solutions .",
