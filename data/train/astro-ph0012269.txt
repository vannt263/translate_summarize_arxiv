    "the x - ray emission from galactic x - ray binaries is known to exhibit aperiodic variability on a vast variety of time scales , from months down to milliseconds ( for reviews see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the pca on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) , has accumulated a large amount of data on the rapid aperiodic variability ( rav ) and its photon - energy dependence for a large number of x - ray binaries .",
    "this information contains valuable hints about the source of high - energy emission in these objects .",
    "since it is generally believed that the x - ray emission above @xmath0  10  kev is due to comptonization of soft photons in a hot , tenuous coronal gas , it is natural to assume that the rav of this emission component also reveals detailed information about the size scales , dominant physical ( heating and cooling ) mechanisms , and geometry of the comptonizing region .",
    "theoretical calculations of the expected time - dependent signatures of comptonization in a hot , tenuous , static corona had been done for the case of a homogeneous corona ( @xcite ) and for inhomogeneous temperature and density distributions in the corona ( kazanas , hua & titarchuk 1997 , hua , kazanas & titarchuk 1997 ) for the case of central injection of soft photons into a spherical region .",
    "this had been generalized to other geometries , including the case of a cool , outer accretion disc adjacent to an inner , hot , quasi - spherical two - temperature inflow by bttcher & liang ( 1998 ) .",
    "while such models , in particular in the case of central injection , representative of a slab - coronal geometry , could successfully reproduce the dominant spectral and timing features of some objects , such as cyg  x-1 , they generally required that the corona on top of the geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk should extend out to radii of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the schwarzschild radius of the accreting compact object , and that out to those radii , the rate of energy dissipation per unit volume would have to decrease only @xmath3 , implying that most of the energy is dissipated at large distance from the central object .",
    "this seems to be very hard to reconcile with realistic calculations of the vertical structure of accretion - disk coronae ( @xcite ) and the radial structure of optically thin , adaf - type flows ( @xcite ) , which indicate that the energy dissipation is concentrated much more strongly towards the disk surface and the central object , respectively .",
    "the required large coronal size scales were implied by the fact that , in these comptonization models , the maximum time lag achievable between hard and soft x - rays corresponds to the difference in photon diffusion time in the process of compton upscattering and is thus of the order of the light travel time through the corona .    in order to avoid this size - scale problem , two alternative models for the hard time",
    "lags in galactic x - ray binaries have been developed . in the first one ( @xcite ) , an inner ,",
    "hot coronal flow is assumed to be surrounded by a cool , outer disc . in irregular intervals , blobs of cool material",
    "are breaking lose from the cool disc and spiral inward through the hot coronal flow .",
    "( during the inspiraling process they may most certainly be tidally disrupted into ring - like density perturbations , but for simplicity , we will continue to call these inward - drifting perturbations `` blobs '' .",
    "it has been shown in bttcher & liang [ 1999 ] that they maintain their integrity as isolated , dense regions , and do not evaporate during the inspiraling process ) . in this model ,",
    "hard lags are due to the spectral hardening resulting from the inward - movement of the soft photon source into hotter regions of the coronal flow , combined with the gradual heating of the blob .",
    "thus , the maximum hard time lag achievable corresponds to the drift time scale of the blobs , which may be several orders of magnitude longer than the light travel time through the corona , thus allowing for a correspondingly smaller corona .    in the second alternative model ( @xcite ) ,",
    "hard x - ray flares are assumed to be produced by magnetic flares in a hot corona on top of a cool accretion disc .",
    "thus , in this model , the flare is produced by additional heating of the comptonizing material rather than a flare of the soft photon input .",
    "the required spectral hardening occurs naturally during the period of efficient energy release in the corona , and hard lags could be produced in a model consistent with the observed weakness of the compton reflection component if the active regions of the corona are driven away from the disc due to radiation pressure ( @xcite ) .    except for the latter model , in which the coronal",
    "heating and cooling are the essential ingredients for modeling the hard x - ray spectral evolution , all the comptonization - based models mentioned above had so far been calculated under the assumption of a static corona with fixed electron temperature , which does not change in response to the increased soft photon input during flares . since it is generally believed that the coronal temperature  at least in spectral states other than the very - low or off state of transient sources",
    " is determined by the energy balance between various heating mechanisms and cooling dominated by compton cooling , this may be an unrealistic assumption , as has been pointed out by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the coronal response to accretion - disc flares in the case of a slab - coronal geometry",
    "has recently been investigated for two special test cases by malzac & jourdain ( 2000 ) .",
    "they found that coronal cooling due to the increased soft photon input leads to rapid cooling of the coronal electron population and a pivoting of the x - ray spectrum around @xmath4  kev for typical parameters , with rather small amplitude variability in the _ rxte _ pca energy range .",
    "they conclude that the resulting variability patterns are inconsistent with the ones observed in most x - ray binaries .    in this paper ,",
    "i am presenting a detailed re - evaluation of variability models based on flaring activity in the soft photon input , taking into account self - consistently the coronal heating and cooling in response to the time - varying soft photon input .",
    "the models considered here are the slab - coronal geometry , the hot inner two - temperature flow with outer , cool accretion disc , and the inward - drifting blob model .",
    "the model of dynamical active coronal regions has been investigated in detail in poutanen & fabian ( 1999 ) , and has also been considered in malzac & jourdain ( 2000 ) . in section [ code ] , a brief description of the coupled monte - carlo / fokker - planck code used for this study is given . in sections",
    "[ slab ] , [ adaf ] , and [ blob ] the results concerning the slab - coronal geometry , the hot inner two - temperature flow with outer , cool accretion disc , and the inward - drifting blob case , respectively , are presented .",
    "section [ summary ] contains a brief summary and conclusions .",
    "for our time - dependent simulations of the radiation transfer and electron heating / cooling , the coupled monte - carlo compton scattering and fokker - planck electron dynamics code described in detail by bttcher & liang ( 2000 ) is used .",
    "this code employs a monte - carlo method similar to the large - particle method ( @xcite ) for the photon transport , including all relevant radiation mechanisms , such as compton scattering , cyclotron / synchrotron emission and absorption , bremsstrahlung emission and absorption , and @xmath5 absorption and pair production and annihilation .",
    "the evolution of the electron population is treated simultaneously through an implicit fokker - planck scheme which allows for arbitrary thermal and/or nonthermal electron distributions . at each time step , the radiative energy - loss rates are normalized self - consistently to the energy transfer between electrons and photons evaluated during the photon - transport calculation in the respective time step .",
    "electron acceleration / heating is possible through coulomb interactions with a pool of background , thermal protons or through resonant wave - particle interaction ( 2@xmath6 order fermi acceleration ) with alfvn and whistler wave turbulence , as well as through self - absorption processes .",
    "this means that  unlike in most other simulations of related problems ( e.g. , @xcite ; li , kusunose , & liang 1996 ; dove , wilms , & begelman 1996 ; @xcite )  the coronal heating compactness is the self - consistent result of specific acceleration processes , and is not a pre - specified parameter .    for the different geometrical and physical scenarios treated below , the corona is generally split up into 10 or 15 vertical or radial zones within which the physical conditions ( electron and proton densities , magnetic fields , etc . ) are assumed to be homogeneous . unless otherwise specified , a globally unordered magnetic field in equipartition with the background thermal proton plasma is assumed .",
    "the properties of all photons escaping the corona toward the observer are written into an event file , from which photon - energy dependent light curves and snapshot photon spectra at arbitrary time intervals can be extracted .",
    "let us first investigate the coronal response to an accretion - disc flare in a slab - coronal geometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such flares could be produced , e.g. , by an unsteady accretion flow through the inner portion of the disk , or by small - scale magnetic flares in the ionized surface layer of the disk .",
    "for this case , the soft photon input from the disc is represented by a thermal blackbody spectrum of @xmath7  kev , typical of the soft excess in the x - ray spectra of black - hole x - ray binaries in the low / hard state .",
    "an accretion disc flare is simulated by increasing the blackbody temperature to 0.5  kev ( i.e. increasing the soft photon compactness by a factor of 39 ) over a limited time interval @xmath8 .",
    "compton reflection of coronal radiation impinging onto the disc is taken into account using the green s functions of white , lightman , & zdziarski ( 1988 ) and lightman & white ( 1988 ) , and at any given time the accretion disc flux is enhanced by the amount of coronal flux absorbed within the disc .",
    "the corona is split up into 10 vertical zones of equal height @xmath9 .",
    "the total height of the corona is fixed to @xmath10  cm , its thomson depth is @xmath11 , and the temperature of the background proton plasma is @xmath12  mev .",

    "[ adc_phaselags ] .",
    "the figure illustrates that a rather rich variety of phase and time lag phenomena can result from this accretion - disc flare scenario with a slab - coronal geometry .",
    "it appears to be consistent with a fourier - frequency independent time lag at low frequencies , breaking into a power - law with @xmath26 , where generally @xmath27 ( e.g. , @xcite for cyg  x-1 ) . in the limit @xmath28 ,",
    "the resulting time lags are dominated by the difference in the fit parameter @xmath29 for the different energy bands , which exhibits a photon energy dependence consistent with the logarithmic time lag dependence measured , e.g. , for cyg  x-1 , grs  1915 + 105 , ( e.g. , @xcite ) and xte  j1550 - 564 ( wijnands , homan , & van der klis 1999 ; cui , zhang , & chen 2000 ) .",
    "the photon - energy dependence of the parameter @xmath29 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ t0_energy ] .",
    "note that this logarithmic energy dependence of the maximum time lag is related to the time scales for compton cooling and relaxation back to thermal equilibrium due to coulomb heating rather than due to the difference in photon diffusion time between hard and soft x - rays as in the case of a static corona .",
    "this naturally avoids the problem of the size - scale constraint for static - corona models for the phase and time lags in the rav of x - ray binaries and , instead , allows to place constraints on the proton temperature and density within the corona , which determine the coulomb heating time scale . assuming that both the electron and proton temperatures are non - relativistic , the coulomb heating time scale ( which is expected to be comparable to the maximum time lag between soft and hard x - rays ) can be estimated as    @xmath30    ( @xcite ) . here , @xmath31 is the coronal proton density in units of @xmath32  @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the dimensionless electron and proton temperature , respectively .",
    "( [ tau_coulomb ] ) indicates that maximum time lags of order @xmath35 ",
    "@xmath36  s can naturally occur in such a scenario .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ adc_phaselags ] also indicates that over a limited frequency range also negative phase lags ( i.e. soft lags ) may occur as a result of the coronal response to accretion - disc flares .",
    "whether this is a potential explanation for the negative and alternating phase lags observed in grs  1915 + 105 ( @xcite ) and xte  j1550 - 564 ( @xcite ) remains to be investigated in more detail in future work .",
    "an important point is that in this scenario , the onset of an accretion - disc flare marks the onset of the episode of enhanced coronal cooling and thus the onset of the decay of the high - energy light curves .",
    "consequently , considering that in a realistic scenario there will be a rapid succession of such flares occurring throughout the disc , the hard x - ray light curves will exhibit maxima around the onsets of the accretion disc flares , with no appreciable offset between the maxima at different photon energies .",
    "this is consistent with the recent result of maccarone et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that the peaks of the cross - correlation function between light curves at different energy bands observed in cyg  x-1 are consistent with 0 time lag .",
    "this would be inconsistent with accretion - disc flaring scenarios in slab - coronal geometry if the observed phase lags were due to the time - dependent comptonization response in a static corona ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative accretion - flow geometry consists of a cool shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) type , thin disc in the outer regions of the flow , which exhibits a transition to an inner , quasi - spherical two - temperature flow , which produces hard x - rays via compton upscattering of self - generated synchrotron and bremsstrahlung photons as well as external soft photons from the surrounding cool accretion disc .",
    "the inner coronal flow could plausibly be a shapiro - lightman - eardley ( 1976 ) type two - temperature flow , an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; @xcite ) or the recently discovered solution of a convection - dominated flow ( @xcite ) .",
    "the timing properties which are subject of this paper , are rather insensitive to the details of the proton density and temperature profile within the inner coronal region .",
    "thus , for simplicity , the density and temperature profiles of the inner corona are fixed corresponding to an adaf , choosing @xmath37 , and the proton temperature , @xmath38 , equal to the virial temperature .",
    "such a two - phase accretion flow model has been suggested to explain the various luminosity states of x - ray binaries ( narayan , mcclintock , & yi 1996 ; @xcite ) , and has been very successful , in particular , to represent the x - ray spectrum of grs  1915 + 105 over a wide range of source luminosities ( e.g. , muno , morgan , & remillard 1999 ) .",
    "thus , for a parameter study , i start out from parameters in the range typically appropriate for spectral fits to grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the inner disc temperature found in grs  1915 + 105 is typically 0.75  kev  @xmath39  2  kev , and the inner disc radius is 10  km  @xmath40  100  km ( @xcite ) . as default settings , for simplicity , the soft radiation input from the cool , outer disc is represented by a thermal blackbody with @xmath41  kev , and the transition radius between cool , outer disc and inner , hot ,",

    "the figures illustrate that in this case , the coronal response to the accretion - disc flares occurs on time scales at least an order of magnitude shorter than in the case of the slab geometry , due to the substantially higher proton densities in the hottest , central regions of the adaf .",
    "this , combined with the short light crossing and photon diffusion times through the corona , @xmath51  s , makes it very unlikely that substantial phase and time lags ( of order @xmath52  s ) can be produced by the thermal and comptonization response in such a geometry . in particular , comparing the medium and hard x - ray light curves in figs .",
    "[ adaf1 ] and [ adaf2 ] one finds that if ( e.g. in the case of a larger corona ) substantial time lags were produced in this geometry due to radiation transfer effects in the corona , they would be accompanied by substantial peak misalignments of the light curves in different energy bands , which is generally not observed ( e.g. @xcite for grs  1915 + 105 ; @xcite for cyg  x-1 ) .",
    "the third flaring scenario investigated here is the model of inward drifting density perturbations ( `` blobs '' ) in a hot , quasi - spherical inner accretion flow , proposed by bttcher & liang ( 1999 ) .",
    "this model is based on the accretion - flow geometry of an outer , cool , optically thick accretion disc and an inner , hot , quasi - spherical two - temperature flow , as in the previous section .",
    "however , in this case , flaring activity is not dominated by flares of the outer accretion disc , but by the inward - drifting of individual blobs ( or ring - like density perturbations ) from the inner boundary of the cool disc through the hot corona , which will eventually disappear within the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "the spectral hardening required to produce hard phase and time lags is a consequence of the combined effects of the soft photon source ( the blob ) moving further inward toward the hotter and denser portions of the corona , and of the heating of the blob as it drifts inward .    by default",
    ", the system of the outer cool disc and the central corona will be described by the same set of standard parameters , appropriate to reproduce typical x - ray spectra of grs  1915 + 105 in its high state , as in the previous section : @xmath43 , @xmath37 , virial proton temperature , @xmath53  km , @xmath54  kev .",

    "however , i choose a rather high radial drift velocity in order to keep the required simulation time at @xmath64  hr ( on a 667  mhz alpha workstation ) , since the code automatically adjusts the intrinsic time step of the simulation to a step size smaller than the time scale of the net physical heating / cooling rate . for lower values of @xmath65 the resulting timing behaviour",
    "is simply stretched over a correspondingly longer time interval , and the respective features in the fourier power and phase lag spectra below @xmath66  khz ( see below ) are shifted to lower frequencies by the same factor , thus increasing the resulting time lags accordingly ( since @xmath67 $ ] ) .",

    "in particular , the overall shape of the time lag spectra , the photon - energy dependence of the time lags , and the small peak misalignment , consistent with 0 , between the light curves at different photon energy bands , can be reproduced in such a geometry .    the model of a flaring disc surrounding a central hot , quasi - spherical two - temperature flow ,",
    "can be ruled out for most objects in which significant phase and time lags have been observed since it would predict very small time lags ( of the order of the light - crossing time through the corona , i.e. @xmath82  ms ) , and light - curve peak misalignments of the order of the maximum time lag , which is generally not observed .",

    "<S> the most popular models for the complex phase and time lags in the rapid aperiodic variability of galactic x - ray binaries are based comptonization of soft seed photons in a hot corona , where small - scale flares are induced by flares of the soft seed photon input ( presumably from a cold accretion disc ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in their original version , these models have neglected the additional cooling of the coronal plasma due to the increased soft seed photon input , and assumed a static coronal temperature structure . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> our monte - carlo / fokker - planck code for time - dependent radiation transfer and electron energetics is used to simulate the self - consistent coronal response to the various flaring scenarios that have been suggested to explain phase and time lags observed in some galactic x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the predictions of models involving slab - coronal geometries are drastically different from those deduced under the assumption of a static corona . however , with the inclusion of coronal cooling they may even be more successful than in their original version in explaining some of the observed phase and time lag features . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the model of inward - drifting density perturbations in an adaf - like , two - temperature flow also differ from the static - corona case previously investigated , but may be consistent with the alternating phase lags seen in grs  1915 + 105 and xte  j1550 - 564 . </S>",
    "<S> models based on flares of a cool disc around a hot , inner two - temperature flow may be ruled out for most objects where significant fourier - frequency - dependent phase and time lags have been observed .    </S>",
