    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) also show excess emission at 4.5@xmath0 m due to h@xmath1 and co molecular bands @xcite .",

    "it is indispensable to make spectroscopic observations in order to study the origin of the excess at 4.5@xmath0 m in egos unambiguously .",

    "the _ akari _ /irc observation of g318.05 + 0.09 was carried out in the director time on 2010 february 18 , which was one of the last observations of the _ akari _ mission ( observation i.d . :",

    ", we adopt the central wavelength of 4.67@xmath0 m and the fwhm of 0.031@xmath0 m obtained from the ns spectroscopy by @xcite and assume the band strength reported in @xcite .",
    "the observed feature can be fitted by absorption of co gas at 20k and co ice as shown in fig .",
    "the contribution from co gas dominates in the absorption . with the present spectral resolution ,",
    "the p and r branches of co gas absorption are not resolved .",
    "the red side is relatively well fitted , while the fit is not good at the blue side , where there might be an additional component at around 4.62@xmath0 m . because of the large noise , however , it is difficult to make further discussion on the additional component .",
    "co gas with 1530k gives similar fits and the gas temperature can not be well constrained . as fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] suggests , the contribution from co ice also has a large uncertainty .",
    "therefore , the present estimate of the column densities of co gas and ice should be taken with caution .",

    "it shows two broad peaks at around 4.5 and 4.7@xmath0 m and no significant emission is seen below 4@xmath0 m .",
    "both the prism and grim spectra show similar characteristics and thus we conclude that these are real features despite the noisy spectra . a small difference between the grism and prism spectra",
    "is seen at wavelengths longer than 4.5@xmath0 m .",
    "it can be attributed partly to the large noise in the grism spectrum and/or to a possible difference in the spectrum extracted region due to the shift of the slit positions on the detector array ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the @xmath12 spectrum can be accounted for by blue - shifted optically thin emission of the fundamental ro - vibrational transitions ( @xmath5 ) of co molecules with red continuum .",
    "the two peaks are attributed to the p and r branches of co gas emission . since the grism spectrum is very noisy and",
    "does not have data longer than 4.9@xmath0 m , we use the prism spectrum to estimate the temperature and the velocity of the co gas .",
    "we simply assume that the continuum increases linearly with the wavelength and the co emission is approximated by the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) condition . from the fit , the temperature and the velocity of the co gas",
    "are estimated as @xmath25k and @xmath26kms@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the grism spectrum requires more steeply increasing continuum , but the best fit parameters of the co gas ( 2000k and @xmath27kms@xmath4 ) are within the uncertainties estimated from the prism spectrum .",

    "[ fig2]b both for the prism ( thick black line ) and grism spectra ( thin black line ) together with the linear continuum ( thick and thin dotted brown lines ) .",
    "the column density of the co gas is estimated from the prism spectrum with the best fit parameters as @xmath28@xmath24 , which does not include the systematic error due to the calibration uncertainty at the time of the observation (  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the shift in the wavelength corresponding to the estimated blue - shift velocity is @xmath29@xmath0 m , which is about a half of the resolution of the prism spectrum , but more than twice of that of the grism spectrum at 4.5@xmath0 m .",
    "the latest wavelength calibration of the grism spectroscopy has been applied (  [ sec : obs ] , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the accuracy is estimated to be better than 0.006@xmath0 m , which is much smaller than the shift .",
    "the wavelength calibration of the prism spectroscopy is less accurate and estimated to be better than 1 pixel or 0.04@xmath0 m at 45@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the prism and grism spectroscopy confirms that both wavelengths match with each other within this accuracy @xcite .",
    "the shift is constrained by the profile shape of the co emission in the fit and non - lte effects could affect the shift estimate . to investigate the reliability of the suggested large blue - shift velocity , we simply calculate the peak positions of the observed spectra and compare them with those of the lte model spectra of different temperatures .",
    "the peak positions are estimated by a gaussian fit in the ranges 4.34.6@xmath0 m and 4.654.9@xmath0 m for the r and p branches , respectively .",
    "we also vary the slope of the underlying continuum for 27mjysr@xmath4@xmath0m@xmath4 , which is determined by the range of the slopes obtained in the co profile fit .",
    "the effect of the continuum slope is found to be smaller ( @xmath30 and @xmath31@xmath0 m for the r and p branches , respectively ) than the uncertainties in the gaussian fits both for the prism and grism spectra .",
    "the peaks of the model co emission are estimated in the same manner .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] plots the difference between the p and r branch peak wavelengths against the estimated peak wavelength of the r branch both for the prism and grism spectra together with those of the model co emission for the temperature range 5004000k with the various blue - shift velocities .",
    "the peak wavelength is sensitive both to the temperature and the blue - shift velocity , but the difference in the branch peaks is sensitive mostly to the temperature .",
    "the latter is used to separate the temperature effect from the velocity effect .",
    "the peak wavelength of the r branch of the prism spectrum agrees with that of the grism spectrum within the calibration uncertainty of the prism spectroscopy .",
    "the prism and grism spectra show compatible values for the difference in the r and p branch peak wavelengths within the uncertainties in the fit .",
    "both data points suggest that the observed spectra can be accounted for by co emission with blue - shift velocities of @xmath3km@xmath4 and that it is difficult to explain the observed peak wavelengths by simple lte models with velocities larger than @xmath32kms@xmath4 . the suggested temperatures of the co emission range from 1200 to 3700k , which are in agreement with the co emission profile fit .",
    "while these analyses suggest a large blue - shift velocity consistently , the present spectra do not have a high signal - to - noise ratio and good spectral resolution .",
    "spectra with higher spectral resolution and better quality are needed to investigate the non - lte effects and confirm the large blue - shift velocity .",
    "source @xmath11 is located close to the position of iras  14498@xmath25856 .",
    "the iras source is classified as an ultra compact ( uc ) region based on the @xmath33 colors and methanol maser emission at 6668 mhz is detected toward this object @xcite .",

    "the prism spectrum of @xmath11 suggests a peak at around 4.5@xmath0 m . it may mimic the r branch of co emission seen in the spectrum of @xmath12 .",
    "however , the prism spectrum does not show a p - branch peak at around 4.7@xmath0 m clearly as seen in @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the peak at around 4.5@xmath0 m is a result of a combination of the saturation effect and the cold co gas absorption and that there is no clear evidence for warm co emission in the spectrum of @xmath11 .",

    "sne are thought to be the major dust suppliers in the interstellar space as well as in the early universe @xcite .",

    "recent observations also reveal the presence of several molecules in sne or snrs , such as sio @xcite , co @xcite , and arh@xmath59 @xcite .",

    "the strong similarity of the @xmath12 spectra to those toward the ejecta knots in the cas a snr suggests that @xmath12 may be associated with sn ejecta .",
