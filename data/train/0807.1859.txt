    "it is worth noting here that , as far as we know , only one experiment @xcite has been performed using the parallel - plate configuration originally envisioned by casimir .",
    "most measurements of the casimir force have studied the interaction of a spherical probe with a flat substrate , using the so - called proximity force theorem  @xcite to relate the force for different geometries of the experiment to the force between two parallel plates .",
    "the experimental search for corrections to this approximation has been done recently .",
    "@xcite for the original plane - parallel geometry , the accuracy of the measurements  @xcite of the casimir force , done for distances ranging from 0.5 to 6 micrometers , is not very high , within 15% .",
    "a significant difficulty has been the necessity to keep the samples parallel during the measurements at different distances .",
    "some of these problems , in principle , could be overcome by measuring the casimir force in a fixed geometry of the experiment ( fixed @xmath4 , for plane - parallel geometry ) by varying some parameters of the sample .",
    "the media properties could be changed by varying the temperature of the sample .",
    "varying the carrier density of semiconductors by laser irradiation has also been proposed recently .",

    "@xcite this limitation can be overcome by using thin metallic films,@xcite but even for this optimal case the temperature corrections are not higher than a few percent .",
    "numerous compounds are known for which the carrier density and plasma frequency @xmath0 are abnormally small .",
    "the investigation of such conducting systems , which can be called `` poor metals '' , is of interest from the point of view of both fundamental physics and applications .",
    "examples include highly doped silicon  @xcite , left - handed materials  @xcite , transition metal oxides showing the metal - insulator transition ( mit )  @xcite , cuprate high - temperature superconductors  @xcite , and manganites where the phenomenon of colossal magnetoresistance is observed .",
    "@xcite for all of these systems , both the free carrier density and the plasma frequency @xmath0 are much smaller than for standard good metals .",
    "this means , that in contrast to the usual metals , @xmath0 is not the highest frequency of the material .",
    "the drude behavior is observed up to infrared frequencies , but with a relatively large value of @xmath46 when @xmath47 ; this value , @xmath48@xmath49 , is determined by transitions of electrons in occupied bands .",

    "the dissipation rate @xmath41 for poor metals can be quite high , of the order of a few percent , or even a few tenths of @xmath0 .",
    "the manifestation of the dispersion for the frequencies corresponding to distances of the order of a few microns provides the possibility to control the casimir force by varying the parameters of the metal .",
    "recently , measurements of the casimir force between a metallic sphere and a sample made with a low - conduction medium , like silicon with different degrees of doping and vanadium dioxide vo@xmath52 , were proposed  @xcite for small separations , around 200400 nm .    here",
    "we develop a general theory of the casimir force for low - conducting compounds , i.e. , poor metals .",
    "we show that , for distances in the sub - micrometer and micrometer ranges , the casimir force for a large variety of such systems can be described by formulae that depend on a small number of parameters , without details of the total spectral characteristics .",
    "the inhomogeneous composite systems considered here , containing small regions of different properties , can be described within this theory .",
    "the application of these results to the region of the metal - insulator transition , where the metallic and dielectric phases coexist , produces _ a very pronounced temperature dependence of the casimir force_.",

    "[ real](a ) .",
    "the value of @xmath163 is quite high , and the calculated change of the casimir force is essentially smaller than for the naive estimate as the difference between the values @xmath84 for an ideal metal and @xmath252 for a dielectric , see eqs .   and .",
    "the relative change of the casimir force is maximal for large enough distances , e.g. , @xmath253",
    ".      manganites ( with antiferromagnetic insulators lamno@xmath254 or ndmno@xmath254 as parent compounds , after substitution of la by divalent ion ) show a metal - insulator transition at the dopant concentration @xmath255 , with a ferromagnetic metallic phase in the low temperature range .",
    "@xcite these systems are very popular now in the context of colossal magnetoresistance , based on the possibility of the metal - insulator transition induced by an external magnetic field , that is caused by the ferromagnetic ordering of the metallic phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard temperature - induced metal - insulator transition is possible for such materials as well .",
    "for example , the typical compound la@xmath234ca@xmath235mno@xmath254 demonstrates a metal - insulator transition at @xmath256 = 250 k. the phase separation state is present for all temperatures below the transition point , and the typical linear dependence of @xmath257 has been observed  @xcite in this region .",
    "note that this metal - insulator transition is accompanied by ferromagnetic ordering . in principle",
    ", it could produce an extra - force of magnetic origin near the transition ( antiferromagnetic ordering , present for some metal - insulator transition , does not produce any source of long - ranged interactions ) .",
    "however , for large enough plane - parallel samples , the magnetic flux lines are closed inside the magnetic sample , and should not produce any serious parasitic effects . for these compounds , @xmath0 is small and the corresponding @xmath258 m .",
    "the main specific feature important for us here is the low value of the dissipation rate : typical values of @xmath259 are @xmath260 0.020.05 , and the low-@xmath1 behavior of the curves shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ,  3 are adequate .    for la@xmath234ca@xmath235mno@xmath254",
    ", the metallic phase corresponds to the low - temperature range , and the value of the force increases when decreasing the temperature , which leads to an opposite temperature behavior of the casimir force , compared to vo@xmath52 .",
    "the value of @xmath163 for this compound is relatively low , and the temperature dependence of the casimir force is sharper than for the previous example .",
    "one more specific feature is the presence of phase separation in the whole region of the metallic phase existence .",
    "thus , one can expect an essential dependence of the casimir force for all temperatures below the transition temperature , see fig .",
    "[ real](b ) .",
    "the casimir force depends on the materials used , and we have studied some of these material - dependent aspects .",
    "the casimir force @xmath261 for a mechanical system containing compounds with a metal - insulator transition shows an _ abrupt _ temperature dependence in the transition region .",
    "the relative change of the force @xmath262 when crossing the transition region can be quite large , of the order of the force itself for a distance @xmath263 56 microns .",
    "the relative change @xmath262 of the casimir force is larger for large distances , where the absolute value of the force is small , but even for a distance @xmath264 m it reaches 30% .",
    "the dependence of the force on temperature is sharp near the percolation threshold , where the static metallic conductivity appears .",
    "when measuring such tiny forces , the exclusion of any parasitic effects , like electrostatic forces , is essential . to avoid electrostatic forces ,",
    "the usual highly - conducting samples are short - circuited .",
    "@xcite this method might appear to be ineffective for the metal - insulator transition compounds near the insulating region .",
    "however , such compounds are more semiconducting than insulating in this region and the conductivity is non - zero at room temperatures .",
    "thus , we believe that the same technique could be used . to increase the conductivity in the semiconducting region , the usual doping by donor or acceptor impurities could be used .",
    "finally , we note that the metal - insulator transition is sometimes accompanied by structural phase transitions , which could lead to some lattice distortions .",
    "thus , care should be taken to choose materials and operating conditions that avoid these additional difficulties .    for measurement of the casimir force for samples made with usual metals ,",
    "small separations are preferable .",
    "the creation of experimental set - ups with very small ( sub - micrometer ) distances between samples is a serious challenge for experimentalists . as follows from our analysis , distances @xmath265 larger than the plasma wavelength @xmath238 are preferable for the experimental observation of the effects , we predict around the region of the metal - insulator transition . for the compounds discussed above",
    ", this means distances of the order of ( 24 ) @xmath59 m . in the planned experiments  @xcite for measuring the casimir force using vanadium oxide samples ,",
    "the separations are ( 0.20.4 ) @xmath59 m , which equals ( 0.10.3 ) @xmath238 .",
    "these values are much smaller than the optimal values noted above . for separations @xmath4 of the order of ( 0.10.3 )",
    "@xmath238 , the casimir force should follow low-@xmath4 asymptotics for any temperature ( in both the metallic and the insulating phases ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the casimir force should be weak and the manifestation of the metal - insulator transition should be minor for such an experimental set - up .",
