    "novae are a kind of cataclysmic variable stars , i.e. close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a low - mass normal star ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the cause of the nova eruption is considered to be the thermonuclear runaway reaction on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "matters transferred from the secondary are accumulated and compressed on the white dwarf . when the temperature and density increase sufficiently , thermo - nuclear runaway reactions occur to cause the nova eruption ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nova eruption is a very exciting phenomenon , and the nova systems are the best classically known transient objects .",
    "payne - gaposchkin ( 1964 ) classified the nova light curve based on the time in days for the decline by 2 magnitudes from the maximum , @xmath0 .",
    "duerbeck ( 1981 ) reported that there are some light curve types of novae .",
    "they suggested a classification system for nova light curves including the class which shows a dust dip . besides these classifications based on the light curve , mclaughlin ( 1942 , 1944 ) introduced the various classes of the spectral evolution ( see also payne - gaposchkin  ( 1957 ) ) .",
    "williams ( 1992 ) divided the early post - outburst spectra of novae into two classes , the fe  ii type nova and he / n type nova , based on the emission lines .",
    "they proposed that the fe  ii type spectrum is formed in a continuous wind , while the he / n type spectrum is formed in a discrete shell .",
    "they also suggested the physics of the hybrid nova , showing the transition from the fe  ii to the he / n spectrum , or simultaneous emission lines of both types .",
    "the diversity of light curves and spectral evolutions of the novae ( demonstrated by e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , however , has not been fully understood .",
    "recently , strope et al .  ( 2010 ) reported the classification and properties of the nova light curves .",
    "they noted that there are at least 14 novae showing the rebrightenings during the early phase as v5558 sgr , and that some of these novae are not very slow novae , in 93 novae of their sample .",
    "v5558  sgr was discovered by y. sakurai at 2007 april 14.777 ( ut ) at magnitude 10.3 .",
    "sakurai gave the position for the new object as r.a .",
    "= ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , sakurai reported that nothing is visible at this location at april 9.8 ( limiting magnitude 11.4 ) .",
    "haseda located several prediscovery images of v5558 sgr , providing the following estimated magnitudes : 11.8 , 11.2 , 10.8 and 10.4 mag at april 7.780 ( ut ) , 11.792 , 13.793 and 14.777 , respectively ( data taken from cbet 931 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "iijima ( 2007 ) obtained medium - dispersion spectra at april 20.12 and 20.14 ( ut ) . in their observations , there are balmer , he  i , fe  ii , mg  ii , si  ii and probably n  ii lines in emission .",
    "the full widths at half maximum ( fwhms ) of h@xmath1 and he  i are 480 km s@xmath2 and 360 km s@xmath2 , respectively",
    ". moreover , most of the prominent emission lines are accompanied by weak absorption components of the p - cygni profiles blueshifted by 400 - 500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "poggiani ( 2008a ) reported the spectroscopic monitoring of v5558 sgr during the pre - maximum stage and the early decline , and found that there are balmer and fe  ii lines in emission during the pre - maximum stage .",
    "the spectra after the first maximum showed balmer , fe  ii and he  i emission lines .",
    "poggiani  ( 2008a ) pointed out that the spectroscopic evolution is similar to that of the slow nova v723  cas .    furthermore , poggiani  ( 2010 ) reported the spectroscopic follow - up during the decline stage .",
    "they derived the absolute magnitude of @xmath36.3 to @xmath35.9 , the typical magnitude at maximum for slow novae such as v723  cas and hr  del .",
    "they also estimated the distance of 1.3 - 1.6 kpc and the white dwarf mass of 0.58 - 0.63@xmath4 .",
    "poggiani  ( 2010 ) mentioned that the low white dwarf mass suggested that v5558 sgr is a critical system whose mass is close to the lower limit to trigger the nova outburst .",
    "our spectral observations are summarized in section 2 .",
    "the results of the spectral monitoring of v5558  sgr are described in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the properties in the light curves and the spectral evolutions in section 4 .",
    "conclusions are stated in section 5 .",
    "our low dispersion spectra with a resolution of @xmath5 ( at 5852   ) have been taken with the fbspec1 and fbspec2 , which have been developed by one of the authors ( mf ) , attached to the 28 cm telescope of the fujii - bisei observatory ( okayama , japan ) .",
    "the spectral coverage is 3800 to 8400  .",
    "the spectra were obtained in 32 nights when the targets were brighter than v = 10 - 11 mag .",

    "the light curve of v5558  sgr shows a prominent premaximum halt , lasting for at least 60 days .",
    "although the origin of the pre - maximum halt is not yet clear , it is known that the duration depends on the speed class .",
    "this long duration is also seen in some slow novae , v723  cas , v1548  aql , hr  del and v463  sct , known to be the very slow novae except v463  sct .",
    "the evolution of the light curve of v5558  sgr is similar to that of , especially , v723  cas in that they both show the long pre - maximum halt , several rebrightenings on a flat part and a slow decline .",
    "v5558  sgr is also classified as the very slow nova .",
    "this is compatible with the feature of the long pre - maximum halt and subsequent flare - like maxima .",
    "friedjung ( 1992 ) referred to the spectroscopic observations of hr  del during the pre - maximum stage ( cf .",
    "they mentioned that the expansion velocity of the photosphere is vely low ( 200 km s@xmath2 ) , unlike the majority of classical novae .",
    "they suggested that the conditions of thermonuclear runaway were only marginally satisfied in hr  del .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the derived white dwarf mass in hr  del ( 0.52 @xmath4 : @xcite , 0.595 @xmath4 : @xcite ) according to the models of thermonuclear runaways ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this suggestion may , thus , apply to the similar slow nova , v5558  sgr .",
    "it is important to measure the white dwarf mass of v5558 sgr .",
    "note that orio and shaviv ( 1993 ) suggested another hypothesis , the local thermonuclear runaway , for the pre - maximum halt .",
    "kato et al .  ( 2002 ) advocated that v463  sct provided a unique opportunity for testing the interpretation of pre - maximum halts , which requires that the conditions of thermonuclear runaway were only marginally satisfied .",
    "hachisu and kato  ( 2004 ) presented an interpretation of long maximum halts from the theoretical side .",
    "they estimated the wd masses to be 0.59 @xmath4 for v723  cas and 1.1 @xmath4 for v463  sct by fitting the decline rate of reproduced light curves , excluding the brightness maxima , based on the optically thick wind model .",
    "they concluded that a nova attains its maximum brightness in the optical light and has a flat peak when the envelope mass is massive enough and the temperature of white dwarf surface decreases to below @xmath67000 k. the duration of the flat peak is considered to depend on the initial envelope mass at the ignition ( @xcite ) .",
    "this flat peak can be regarded as a premaximum halt .",
    "they interpreted several strong peaks of the light curve of v723 cas as pulsations of the nova envelope as discussed by schenker  ( 1999 ) .",
    "schenker  ( 1999 ) attempted to apply radial pulsations , based on the @xmath7-mechanism , in envelopes to the physical origin of the oscillation phase of classical novae . in v5558 sgr",
    ", the brightness during the pre - maximum halt slowly rise unlike v723 cas .",
    "this feature is not explained by the scenario proposed by hachisu and kato ( 2004 ) .",
    "iijima et al .",
    "( 1998 ) presented the spectral evolution of v723  cas .",
    "they reported the spectra in the long pre - maximum stage .",
    "there were balmer and fe  ii lines in emission .",
    "most of the emission lines were accompanied by strong absorption components of the p - cygni profiles .",
    "the emission lines gradually weakened , and the absorption lines developed .",
    "these features of emission and absorption lines were not seen in our observations of v5558  sgr . in our observations , there were also balmer and fe  ii lines in emission .",
    "the emission lines , however , did not weaken , and strong absorption components of the p - cygni profiles did not appear during the pre - maximum stage .",
    "on april 16 ( jd 2454202.27 ) , we can identify the absorption component of the p - cygni profile of he  i  6678 with the blue - shift velocity , about @xmath8 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this value is higher than the velocities in v723  cas , by about @xmath9 km s@xmath2 or in hr  del , by about @xmath10 km s@xmath2 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , iijima et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reported that the blue - shift of the absorption components decreased with time during the pre - maximum stage and then slightly increased at the maximum brighteness .",
    "they suggested that this is because a new high velocity absorption system emerged .",
    "we can not confirm this trend in v5558  sgr , since absorption components of the p - cygni profiles disappeared during the pre - maximum stage .",
    "the detailed description of the spectral evolution is given in the subsection 4.3 .",
    "the difference of v5558 sgr and v723 cas and hr del suggests a possibility that v5558 sgr has the heavier white dwarf and the ejecta of v5558 sgr was lighter , and the specific photosphere could not form during the pre - maximum phase , then .",
    "table [ tab_pcygni ] shows the blue - shift velocities of the absorption components of the p - cygni profiles .",
    "we hereafter call the velocity of the absorption component measured from the emission peak as the radial velocity for simplicity . in the pre - maximum stage ,",
    "the radial velocities of he  i , fe  ii and h  i lines is about @xmath8 to @xmath11 km s@xmath2 .",
    "after the initial brightness maximum , the radial velocities increase . in the rebrightening stage ,",
    "the radial velocities become higher , over about @xmath12 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we can find the trend that the radial velocity becomes low at the brightness maximum , and becomes high outside the brightness maximum .",
    "after the rebrightening stage , the absorption components disappear and we can not derive the radial velocity except on 2008 march 17 .",
    "the radial velocity of he  i  5876 on march 17 is higher , @xmath13 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the long - term trend of increase of the radial velocity suggests that the velocity is higher in the inner region because the photosphere gradually shrinks .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with the low radial velocity at the brightness maximum when re - expansion of the photosphere ocuurs as noted in the subsection 4.4 .",
    "the spectral evolution of v5558 sgr is very rare .",
    "on 2007 april 16 ( jd 2454202.27 ) , during the pre - maximum halt , the spectrum of v5558 sgr is dominated by balmer and he  i lines in emission .",
    "these emission lines of the spectrum show the nature of the he / n type nova .",
    "the fmhws of h@xmath14 and he  i  5876   are , however , of low velocities , about 700 km s@xmath2 and 500 km s@xmath2 , respectively , unlike in the majority of he / n novae .",
    "he  i lines then weaken very much by april 25 and fe  ii lines appear . williams ( 1992 ) reported existense of the hybrid type nova .",
    "they suggested that fe  ii spectra , in the transition from the fe  ii to the he / n spectrum , with unusually broad lines , the half width at zero intensity ( hwzi ) @xmath15 2500 km s@xmath2 , probably originate from discrete shells which are rather massive and therefore optically thick .",
    "as the expanding shell becomes optically thin , the spectrum changes to the more typical higher ionization he / n spectrum of the shells .",
    "this scenario may not apply the pre - maximum stage .",
    "the spectrum during the pre - maximum halt of slow novae is basically dominated by fe  ii type emission lines ( see figure [ v55582 ] in this paper and @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum at the earliest phase during the pre - maximum halt may also show emission lines of the he / n type also in other novae .",
    "the earliest spectrum may have been overlooked in other novae since the duration of this stage should be very short .",
    "the spectral transition of v5558 sgr during the early stage , from the he / n type toward the fe  ii type , is a rare evolution at least at this time .",
    "moreover , the spectra of v5558 sgr then evolved to the fe  ii and he / n hybrid type after the initial maximum brightness ( for example , the spectrum on 2007 july 23 ) .",
    "we note that he  i lines become weak and p - cygni absorptions become strong at the maximum brightness .",
    "futhermore , he  i and he  ii lines become strong at the decline stage after the rebrightening stage .",
    "fwhms of he  i or balmer at the decline stage are about 800 - 900 km s@xmath2 , which is slower than the typical he / n novae .    as noted in the subsection 4.1 , iijima et al .",
    "( 1998 ) presented the spectral evolution of v723  cas .",
    "they reported the spectra in the long pre - maximum stage .",
    "there were balmer and fe  ii lines in emission .",
    "most of the emission lines were accompanied by strong absorption components of the p - cygni profiles .",
    "iijima ( 2006 ) reported on the spectral evolution after the maximum brightness of v723 cas .",
    "in v723 cas , two weeks after its maximum and at about two magnitudes below its maximum , there are balmer , fe  ii and he  i emission lines , simultaneously . at the second brightening , p - cygni absorption components appeared on balmer , he  i , and fe  ii lines . when the nova faded by about four magnitudes , during the decline stage , the prominent emission lines are of balmer , he  i , [ n  ii ] , [ fe  ii ] , [ o  iii ] , n  ii , n  iii , and si  ii , while most of the emission lines of fe ii have disappeared .",
    "this transition after the initial maximum brightness of v723 cas is similar to that of v5558 sgr .",
    "the transition during the pre - maximum stage are , however , different between v5558 sgr , he / n type toward fe  ii type , and v723 cas .",
    "it should be noted that v723 cas possibly showed the he / n spectra before the first observation by iijima et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the light curves of some novae , for example v1186  sco , v2540  oph , v5113  sgr , v4745  sgr and v458  vul , show several rebrightenings during the early phase ( see e.g. v1186  sco : @xcite ; v2540  oph : @xcite ; v5113  sgr : @xcite ; v4745  sgr : @xcite ; v458  vul : @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of these novae show many emission lines accompanied with the absorption components of p - cygni profiles at the brightness maximum ( @xcite ) .",
    "tanaka et al .  ( 2011 ) suggested that the re - appearance of the absorption component at the rebrightening maxima is attributable to re - expansion of the photosphere after it once shifts sufficiently inside .",
    "the spectra of v5558  sgr also show the similar trend , that the absorption components of p - cygni profiles develop at the brightness maximum .",
    "the photosphere of v5558  sgr could , thus , cause the similar physical transition .",
    "they also reported that the time interval between successive maxima increase gradually .",
    "we can not identify this trend for v5558 sgr .",
    "the light curve of v5558  sgr shows the pre - maximum halt and then several flare - like rebrightenings .",
    "sgr is classified as a very slow nova , and is similar to v723  cas .",
    "we obtained the low - resolution spectra of v5558  sgr at the fujii - bisei observatory on 32 nights between 2007 april 16 and 2008 may 3 .",
    "we presented the behavior of the pre - maximum stage and compared with other novae .",
    "the transition of spectra of v5558 sgr is similar to the very slow nova v723 cas roughly .",
    "the transition from he / n type to fe  ii type during the pre - maximum stage , however , seems a unique phenomenon in v5558 sgr , though there is a possibility that this transition is undergone also in other novae , but have been missed since it occurs well before the maximum .",
    "our data revealed spectroscopic changes during the pre - maximum halt and then several flare - like rebrightenings .",
    "the spectra at the pre - maximum halt shows the rare evolution .",
    "there are balmer and he  i lines at the first observation ( jd 2454202.27 ) , and then the spectra varied from the he / n nova to the fe  ii type nova . the spectra at and around brightness maximum during the rebrightenings , we can identified many lines accompanied by a strong absorption component of the p - cygni profile .",
    "there are also he  i and fe  ii lines simultaneously .",
    "moreover , he  i and he  ii lines become strong during the decline stage .",
    "fwhms of emission lines are , however , lower than that of typical he / n novae .    in addition , we compared v5558 sgr with other novae showing the several rebrightenings during the early phase .",
    "there are common features that the absorption components of the p - cygni profiles become strong at the maximum brightness .",
    "there is a possibility that the photosphere reexpand at maximum brightness .",
    "the authors are thankful for observers who have posted their precious data to vsnet and aavso .",
