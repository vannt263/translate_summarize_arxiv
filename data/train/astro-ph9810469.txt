    "there is extensive theoretical and observational interest in establishing what fraction of the total ionizing luminosity from the stellar disk of the milky way and other galaxies escapes into the halo and the intergalactic medium ( miller & cox 1993 ; dove & shull 1994 ; leitherer  1996 ) .",
    "this quantity is also of cosmological interest , since if @xmath2 exceeds a few per cent , then star - forming galaxies dominate over agn in producing the ionizing background at low redshift ( giallongo , fontana , & madau 1997 ) .",
    "observationally , it is extremely difficult to measure this quantity directly .",
    "leitherer(1995 ) used _ hut _ observations of four uv - bright galaxies to constrain  to typically no more than a few percent at the lyman limit .",
    "however , hurwitz , jelinsky & dixon ( 1997 ) showed that absorption by gas within the milky way , which was ignored by leitherer , raises these limits substantially , to @xmath3 , so that they are no longer significant constraints .",
    "recently , weiner & williams ( 1996 ; hereafter w@xmath4 ) have detected   emission at three points along the magellanic stream .",
    "we demonstrate that this signal is almost certainly due to ionizing photons escaping from the disk of the galaxy . in the following section",
    ", we present a simple model for the production and escape of ionizing photons from the disk . in  3 , we use the  observations to measure the mean ionizing photon opacity ( @xmath5 ) of the disk , which determines both the shape and normalization of the galactic halo ionizing field . finally ,",
    "in  4 , we discuss the implications for observations of the stream , high - velocity clouds , and the cosmic ionizing background .",
    "_ galactic disk .",
    "_ we construct an idealized model for the ionizing radiation field away from the galactic plane .",
    "the coordinate system is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the ionizing stars are assumed to be isotropic emitters confined to a thin disk ; since we are interested in emitting regions at distances much greater than the stellar disk thickness , the neglect of the finite thickness of the disk is reasonable . at coordinates @xmath6 , a distance @xmath7 from an arbitrary patch of the disk @xmath8 , the received flux @xmath9 ( in units of ) from ionizing disk sources with specific intensity @xmath10 , through a solid angle @xmath11 , is @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the normally incident , ionizing photon flux from the disk ( in units of ) is @xmath15 for which @xmath16 and d@xmath17 are the surface photon density and brightness , respectively , within each disk element @xmath8 .",
    "vacca  ( 1996 ) have compiled a list of 429 o stars within 2.5 kpc of the sun , from which they determine an ionizing photon surface density at the solar circle of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 kpc ( reid 1993 ) .",

    "the explicit contribution from b stars leads to only a small correction .",
    "the o star survey region includes part of the local arm and extends to the neighboring sagittarius - carina and perseus spiral arms ( see taylor & cordes 1993 ) .",
    "observations with the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _ of face - on , mid to late - type spiral galaxies ( made available by e.p .",
    "smith ) give us confidence that our extrapolation is reasonable .",
    "all integrations are performed out to 25 kpc in radius ( de geus  1993 ; ferguson  1998 ) , giving an integrated photon flux over the disk of @xmath24 .",
    "this value is consistent with mezger s ( 1978 ) estimate and within 25% of the rate inferred from cobe / firas observations of the galactic [ nii ] 205@xmath25 m emission ( bennett  1994 ) .",

    "we approximate the disk ism by a smooth distribution .",
    "since the absorbing disk thickness ( @xmath32100 pc ) is negligible compared to the height of the magellanic stream above the galactic plane , we can assume plane - parallel absorption for which @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the photon absorption perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "since for the purposes of this paper we are only interested in the total ionizing photon flux , and not the detailed spectral shape , we characterize the radiation field by the mean ionizing photon opacity @xmath5 ( the value averaged over photon energy ) .",

    "absorption line observations of highly ionized species have confirmed the presence of hot gas at kiloparsec heights above the galactic plane ( savage  1989 ; sembach & savage 1992 ) . the presence of an actual large - scale hot corona , as opposed to a patchy distribution of hot gas arising in the disk , is more uncertain ( wang & mccray 1993 ) . to investigate the influence of such a corona ,",

    "absorption lines towards stars in the magellanic clouds have been used to infer coronal temperatures and gas densities ; songaila ( 1981 ) finds @xmath58 kev ( @xmath59 k ) and @xmath60 @xmath36 .",
    "alternatively , various groups have attempted to model the magellanic stream as clumps moving through a hot , viscous fluid ( moore & davis 1994 ) .",
    "an additional constraint is provided by pulsar dispersion measures ( @xmath61 @xmath36 pc ) along sight lines to the lmc / smc system , and a halo globular cluster , ngc 5024 ( taylor , manchester & lyne 1993 ) ; these values imply electron densities of order 10@xmath62 @xmath36 .",
    "however , the  column arises primarily within the diffuse ionized gas layer in the galactic disk ( the reynolds layer ) , so that the true electron densities must be considerably smaller . following moore & davis ( 1994 ) , we adopt @xmath63 kpc and n@xmath64 , which predicts a density of @xmath65 @xmath36 at @xmath66 kpc , and assume @xmath67 k , the virial temperature of the galactic halo ( for an assumed circular velocity of 220 km s@xmath68 ) .",

    "the contours are for brightness temperatures of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 1 , 1.4 , 1.8 k.    these plasma constraints on the density and temperature imply that any contribution from a galactic corona to the ionizing photon flux at the stream is insignificant ( eqn .",

    "2 illustrates the relationship of the lmc to the magellanic stream above the galactic disk ( mathewson & ford 1984 ) .",
    "the lmc lies close to the @xmath46-@xmath47 plane .",
    "we make the assumption that the stream lies along a circular orbit , close to the @xmath46-@xmath47 plane , originating from the lagrangian point between the lmc and smc , at a galactocentric distance of 55 kpc .",

    "] however , most computed orbits for the lmc - smc system imply substantial ellipticity along the stream ( lin  1995 ) .    in order to derive  emission measures , we assume an electron temperature t@xmath74k , as expected for gas photoionized by stellar sources ; the case b hydrogen recombination coefficient is @xmath75 @xmath76 s@xmath68 . at these temperatures ,",
    "collisional ionization processes are negligible . in this case , for an optically thick slab , the column recombination rate in equilibrium must equal the normally incident ionizing photon flux , @xmath77 , where  is the rate at which lyc photons arrive at the cloud surface ( ) , @xmath78 is the electron density and @xmath79 is the column density of ionized hydrogen and helium .",
    "the emission measure is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the thickness of the ionized region .",
    "the resulting emission measure for an ionizing flux  is then @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) where @xmath84 . for an optically thin cloud in an isotropic radiation field , the solid angle from which radiation is received is @xmath85 , while for one - sided illumination , @xmath86 . for our disk model ,",

    "the top curves assume an optically thin galactic disk with ( dashed line ) and without ( solid line ) the lmc ionizing field . for the lower curves ,",
    "the solid lines assume an opaque ( @xmath91 ) ionizing disk with ( thin line ) and without ( thick line ) a bremsstrahlung halo ; the lmc contribution is shown by the long - dashed curve .",
    "the dot - dash curve is @xmath92 ( ) predicted for the upper side of the stream due to the bremsstrahlung halo ; the cosmic ionizing background is expected to dominate here .",
    "the open circles are the w@xmath4   measurements .",
    "the stream  detections are ( 1.1 , 0.63 , 0.60 )  or , equivalently , ( 370 , 210 , 200 ) mr phot @xmath93 s@xmath68 sr@xmath68 or 2.41@xmath9410@xmath95 erg @xmath93 s@xmath68 sr@xmath68 at . ] .",
    "3 reveals that the stream is highly clumped : the non - detections and weak detections fall in regions of low mean column density ( @xmath96 @xmath93 ) , whereas the detections fall in regions of higher column density by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the near - constancy of the detected signal argues for a photoionization origin .",
    "we suspect that the projected gas is clumpy on all scales , and that the detected regions are those in which the areal filling factor of neutral gas within the beam is essentially unity , so that all of the incident ionizing photons are absorbed by the gas .",
    "the close match between the  and  kinematics also supports static photoionization .",
    "the observed @xmath92 thus directly measures the ionizing photon flux incident on this portion of the stream .",
    "we can therefore use the  detections to determine the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the galaxy .    in fig .  4",
    ", we show the predicted @xmath92 values along the stream , normalized to the  detections .",
    "this requires a mean opacity @xmath97 , corresponding to @xmath98 .",
    "( note that for @xmath99 , the stream would be highly ionized . )",
    "the large opacity of the disk elongates the surfaces of constant photon flux density along the polar axis of the galaxy ( bland - hawthorn 1998 ) . in this direction ,",
    "the disk radiation field dominates over the cosmic background (  @xmath100 : vogel  1995 ) out to a distance of at least 200 kpc .",
    "we treat the lmc as a point source from which @xmath101",
    "ionizing photons escape per second ( smith , cornett & hill 1987 ) .",
    "the galactic radiation field dominates except within distances @xmath3210 kpc of the lmc .",
    "the conclusion that approximately 6% of the ionizing photons produced in the galaxy escapes entirely from the disk and halo has major implications for both the structure and energetics of the ism and the cosmic ionizing background .",
    "the uncertainty in this estimate is approximately 50% , and is contributed equally by the uncertainty in the ionizing flux incident on the stream ( whether the beam filling factor of high column density gas is actually unity for any of the measurements ) , and by our knowledge of the total ionizing photon luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "reynolds ( 1990 ) has estimated that approximately 15% of the ionizing photons produced in the galactic disk are needed to power the diffuse ionized gas layer , they must escape from the disk and reach heights of several hundred parsecs before absorption .",
    "our inference that approximately 6% of the ionizing photon luminosity escape the halo entirely lends substantial credence to the assertion of miller & cox ( 1993 ) that the o star population of the galaxy is responsible for the ionization and heating of the diffuse ionized gas layer .",
    "a relatively intense , ionizing radiation field at large heights above the plane also has profound implications for the study of the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) . since their discovery more than 30 years ago , understanding of the nature and physical characteristics of the hvcs has been severely hampered by the almost complete absence of data on their distances ( wakker & van woerden 1997 ) .",
    "however , our determination of the ionizing radiation field in the galactic halo , normalized by the stream detections , indicates that it should be possible to derive  distances to hvcs out to at least @xmath32 100 kpc ( bland - hawthorn  1998 ; tufte , reynolds & haffner 1998 ) .",
