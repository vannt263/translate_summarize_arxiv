    "recently considerable progress has been achieved in the calculations of three nucleon ( 3n ) continuum states .",
    "it is now possible to generate exact 3n bound @xcite and scattering @xcite states for any realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction even with inclusion of a three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) .",
    "this opens now the possibility to study the interaction of electromagnetic and/or weak probes with the 3n systems ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 nuclei ) without introducing into the analysis the uncertainties due to inadequate approximate 3n states . only using such exact states nuclear dynamics",
    "can be tested with such probes and important information can be gained on the corresponding hadronic current operators .",
    "elastic and inelastic electron scattering on @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) as well as photodisintegration of @xmath1 or pd capture are prominent examples of such processes and have been studied since many years with the hope to get insights into 3n bound state wave functions and into the hadronic current operator .",
    "as was shown in a series of recent papers on electromagnetic processes @xcite @xcite @xcite a very important and unavoidable ingredient for their analysis is the exact treatment of the interaction among the three nucleons in the continuum states . it is also important , that the three - nucleon wave functions should be based on realistic nuclear forces . in this paper",
    "we would like to study the importance of final state interactions ( fsi ) between the nucleons in muon capture on @xmath1 .",
    "there are three final channels following the capture of a negative muon on @xmath1 : @xmath3 the capture rate for the @xmath4 channel has been extensively studied using the elementary particle method and the impulse approximation @xcite @xcite .",
    "when removing the nuclear uncertainties by using accurate three - body bound wave functions , this reaction offers the possibility to extract the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant with nearly the same precision as from the capture process by a free proton @xcite .",
    "the old calculations of the total decay rates for the dn@xmath5 ( two - body breakup of @xmath1 ) and pnn@xmath5 ( three - body breakup of @xmath1 ) channels performed in @xcite using the impulse approximation and 3n bound and scattering states generated within the amado model with separable @xmath6 and @xmath7 two - nucleon interactions showed that scattering effects are large .",
    "the resulting total rates were in agreement with some of the limited and rather inaccurate experimental results while disagreed with others @xcite .",
    "recently the first measurement of energy spectra for deuteron and proton leaving @xmath1 after nuclear muon capture leading to two - body and three - body breakup , respectively , has been reported @xcite @xcite .",
    "the partial capture rates were compared in @xcite to simple plane wave impulse approximation calculations yielding fair agreement with the measured proton energy spectrum but underpredicting the measured rate of deuteron production by a large factor .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to study if the inclusion of fsi by using an exact n - d scattering state can account for this discrepancy . in section",
    "ii we describe our way to fully include fsi . in section iii predictions for decay rates obtained with two realistic nn interactions : bonn b @xcite and paris @xcite",
    "are shown and compared to the experimental values .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "fig.1 . depicts the kinematics of the reaction .",
    "our basis of the muon capture on @xmath1 forms the more fundamental weak - interaction capture process on hydrogen : @xmath8 the initial state @xmath9 is composed of the atomic k - shell muon wave function @xmath10 with spin projection @xmath11 and the @xmath1 state @xmath12 with spin projection m and four momentum @xmath13 we choose the lab system with @xmath14 the transition leads to the final state @xmath15 where @xmath5 is the four momentum of the neutrino and @xmath16 its spin projection .",
    "the state @xmath17 is the interacting neutron - deuteron state with overall four momentum @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding s - matrix element @xmath19 is given in first order perturbation theory and assuming the fermi form for the interaction lagrangian by @xmath20 the leptonic matrix element @xmath21 is known and is expressed in terms of the corresponding dirac spinors for the neutrino @xmath22 and the muon @xmath23 by @xmath24 in the nuclear matrix element neither the current operator @xmath25 nor the nuclear wave functions are equally well under control . in the following we restrict ourselves to the impulse approximation ( ia ) and neglect the exchange current effects .",
    "the single nucleon current operator is parametrized in terms of weak - interaction formfactors @xmath26 @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 are standard nucleon creation and anihilation operators , @xmath29 is the isospin lowering operator and @xmath30 . for the nucleon",

    "nuclear wave functions are generated by the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation with realistic nuclear forces .",
    "therefore to be consistent , the nuclear - current should also be chosen nonrelativistically .",
    "after a nonrelativistic reduction of ( 4 ) and introducing standard jacobi momenta @xmath33 one gets for @xmath34 defined in eq.(2 ) @xmath35 where the momentum space matrix elements of @xmath36 are @xmath37 @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the treatment of the final state follows @xcite @xcite . for the convenience of the reader we repeat the most important steps .",
    "the final scattering state @xmath40 is decomposed into faddeev components @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a sum of cyclical and anticyclical permutations of three nucleons .",
    "the faddeev component obeys the equation @xmath44 and the state @xmath45 describes the free relative motion of the final nucleon and the deuteron . inserting ( [ siedem ] ) and ( [ faddeev ] ) into ( [ piecpol ] ) yields @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( symmetrized plane wave impulse approximation ) corresponds to the case that in eq.(6 ) @xmath48",
    "is replaced by @xmath49 and therefore no interactions between the outgoing nucleon and the deuteron are present . for the @xmath50 term , which contains",
    "all rescattering , @xmath48 is replaced by @xmath51 .",
    "the rescattering term can be written as @xcite",
    "@xcite @xmath52 with @xmath53 this integral equation has the same integral kernel which one also finds in the 3n continuum @xcite and the same numerical methods can be used to solve it for any nn interaction .",
    "we solve eq.([calkowe ] ) in a partial wave decomposition and in momentum space .",
    "for details we refer to @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the decay rate follows from @xmath19 in a standard way @xcite and for the capture process with an unpolarized initial state and without polarization of the outgoing particles , it is given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 in the lab .",
    "system and @xmath56 .",
    "the factors in ( 13 ) come from averaging over the spin of the initial particles , @xmath57 from the states normalizations , @xmath58 and from the muon wave function ( which is taken as an atomic k - shell wave function ) , @xmath59 , with @xmath60",
    "to calculate the decay rates one has to evaluate the nuclear matrix elements @xmath34 .",
    "the initial 3n bound state of @xmath1 is always based on a 34 channel faddeev calculation . in treating the 3n continuum we included all 3n partial waves with total nn angular momenta up to @xmath61 . in order to check the convergence of the results",
    "also calculations restricted to 3n states with @xmath62 nn force components only and with @xmath63 have been performed . as nn force",
    "we use the bonn b @xcite and paris @xcite potentials .",
    "let us first consider the case of a kinematically complete situation in the outgoing n - d channel . since the outgoing channel contains 3 particles and the decay originates from an initial state of zero momentum one needs only 2 kinematical parameters to completely define the momenta of the outgoing particles .",
    "for these 2 parameters the neutrino and deuteron energies @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be taken .",
    "the kinematically allowed range of neutrino energies is @xmath66 $ ] with @xmath67 for each neutrino energy there is a range of allowed deuteron energies as shown in fig.2 .",
    "each deuteron energy corresponds to a unique angle between neutrino and deuteron momenta . in fig.3",
    "we show decay rates @xmath68 for two values of the deuteron energy .",
    "there is a drastic increase in decay rates by a factor of @xmath69 , when the interactions between the neutron and the deuteron in the final state are included .",
    "the increase is practically independent from the deuteron and neutrino energies .",
    "fig.4 shows that the results obtained restricting to @xmath70 nn force components might be not yet fully converged . nevertheless as is clear from fig.5 they are sufficient to analyse the existing data .",
    "the drastic effects of fsi show that any analysis of the experimental data should be based on realistic continuum wave functions . up to now only one data set for the @xmath71capture on @xmath1 leading to the @xmath72 outgoing channel exists @xcite @xcite . in order to compare our results to those data",
    "one has to numerically integrate the decay rate at every deuteron energy over the unobserved neutrino energy .",
    "this leads to the results presented in fig.5 .",
    "it is cleary seen that while the pwias predictions drastically underestimate the data , the inclusion of fsi leads to a rather good agreement , which is fairly independent from the nn interaction used .",
    "also the covergence in @xmath73 is similar to the kinematically complete cases as can be seen in fig.6 .",
    "we calculated the decay rates for muon capture on @xmath1 leading to the n+d+@xmath74 channel .",
    "realistic nn forces have been used ( bonn b and paris potentials ) and both the 3n bound state and the 3n continuum scattering wave functions were evaluated consistently solving the corresponding faddeev equations .",
    "we used the most simple nonrelativistic single nucleon weak - current operator parametrized by the standard nucleon weak formfactors .",
    "both in the kinematically complete und the uncomplete situations the predictions of the plane - wave impulse approximation for the final neutron - deuteron state drastically differ by a factor of about @xmath75 200 from the full result including final state interaction .",
    "the comparison to the only existing uncomplete data for this process reveals , that a good description of the data only results when the fsi is taken into account .",
    "the total failure of pwias in describing those data shows that any future analysis of this process should be performed with bound and scattering states generated consistently from a realistic 3n hamiltonian . from the theoretical point of view mesonic exchange currents should also be added in future analysis .",
