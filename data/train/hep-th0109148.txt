    "abelian projection was introduced by t hooft in an attempt , through a suitable choice of gauge , to decompose a non - abelian gauge field in its neutral and charged components  @xcite . in its simplest form",
    "it involves choosing an observable @xmath2 that transforms under gauge transformations as @xmath3 , which can be used to diagonalise @xmath2 .",
    "this can be done in a smooth way when none of the eigenvalues coincide .",
    "the remaining gauge freedom is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rank of the gauge group .",
    "these are associated with the @xmath5 neutral gauge bosons in this gauge .",
    "singularities occur when two ( or more ) eigenvalues coincide , and these can in three dimensions be shown to give rise to ( generically ) point - like singularities representing magnetic monopoles , as defined with respect to the remnant abelian gauge group .    a smoother , but non - local , abelian gauge fixing can be introduced  @xcite by taking an abelian field as a background ( e.g. for @xmath0 the component proportional to @xmath6 ) , and imposing the background gauge condition on the charged component of the gauge field .",
    "this can be formulated by minimising @xmath7 along the gauge orbit .    inspired by the abelian projection , faddeev and niemi attempted to identify the field @xmath8 ( here of unit length , @xmath9 ) in an @xmath10 non - linear sigma model with the local colour direction for @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "the hope was that the static _ knotted _ solutions constructed numerically  @xcite in the model originally introduced by faddeev  @xcite , were possibly related to glueballs  @xcite .",
    "a difficulty is that one would not expect dynamics for a quantity that is associated with the colour direction , due to gauge invariance .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath10 symmetry is in general spontaneously broken for non - linear sigma models in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the associated goldstone bosons are unwanted in non - abelian gauge theories without matter .",
    "we will see that nevertheless the @xmath11 field _ can _ be identified with an @xmath0 gauge field , albeit with zero field strength . under this identification",
    "we have @xmath12 , giving a hint that minimising the @xmath10 energy functional can be interpreted  @xcite in terms of maximal abelian gauge fixing , as will be discussed in section 2 .",
    "the static knotted solutions , as maps @xmath13 from @xmath14 ( compactified @xmath15 ) to @xmath16 , are classified by the hopf invariant .",
    "the pre - image of a generic value of @xmath11 traces out a loop in @xmath15 ( i.e. the collection of points @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ) .",
    "the linking number of any two of such loops is equal to this hopf invariant .",
    "this also coincides with the winding number of the gauge function @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the pauli matrices .",
    "the associated @xmath0 gauge field with zero field strength is @xmath22 .",
    "such a relation between hopf invariant and topological charge can also occur for monopoles .",
    "a basic monopole is characterised by a hedgehog , with the higgs field defining the colour direction , pointing out radially .",
    "if we gauge rotate the monopole ( for the spherically symmetric case , equivalent to a real rotation ) while moving along its worldline , a particular point of the hedgehog will trace out a loop whose linking with the monopole worldline is an invariant .",
    "this was used by taubes to make from monopole fields , configurations with non - zero topological charge  @xcite . in his formulation a monopole - antimonopole pair is created and separated to a finite distance . kept at this separation one of them is rotated around the axis connecting the two .",
    "after this is completed they are brought together and made to annihilate . the time is considered to be euclidean and the rotation introduces a  twist \" in the field that prevents the four dimensional configuration from decaying to @xmath23 .",
    "the obstruction is precisely the topological charge , whose value is equal to the net number of rotations .",
    "this process can just as well be described in terms of a closed monopole loop ( in the same way that the wilson loop is associated with the creation , propagation and annihilation of a heavy quark - antiquark pair ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : taubes ] .",
    "the identification with the hopf invariant should be understood in the following sense : the orientation of the monopole is described by @xmath24 at each point on the monopole loop ( @xmath25 ) , describing a twisted @xmath16 bundle over @xmath25 , e.g. making the total space into an @xmath14 for one full  frame \" rotation .",
    "this is the hopf fibration , although we have interchanged fibre and base space as compared to the usual formulation .",
    "at finite temperature @xmath26 plays the role of the higgs field and the calorons ( periodic instantons ) provide an explicit example of this taubes winding , when it has a non - trivial value of the polyakov loop at infinity .",
    "this polyakov loop is independent of the directions at infinity , because the finite action of the caloron forces the field strength to vanish at infinity . in this case",
    "the caloron splits in ( @xmath27 for @xmath28 ) constituent monopoles , which are the basic spherically symmetric bps monopoles . of these , @xmath29 are time independent , whereas the time dependence of the other exactly coincides with the rotation ( at a uniform rate )  @xcite of the taubes winding . in terms of the abelian projection and the introduction of a composite higgs field",
    "the relation of the hopf invariant with twisted monopole loops has been extensively studied by jahn  @xcite .    in section 3",
    "we will use the polyakov loop as the observable @xmath30 to be diagonalised , a version of abelian projection that is non - local in time . for the application to the calorons",
    "this is not a problem , since at high temperature the action density is static .",
    "the static action density is not in conflict with the taubes winding , as this is associated to a gauge rotation .",
    "defects occur when eigenvalues coincide .",
    "their location is not an artifact of the gauge , since eigenvalues are gauge invariant . but another choice of @xmath31 will give generically defects at other locations .",
    "in the light of this there seems no reason to expect the defects to always be associated to physical lumps .",
    "we study in how far this is true in the case where two of the constituents for the @xmath1 caloron are brought close together  @xcite .",
    "in section 4 we end with some conclusions concerning the role of topology in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the model is defined in terms of a three - vector @xmath8 of fixed ( here chosen unit ) length . to allow for non - trivial static solutions",
    "a skyrme - like higher - order term is added  @xcite , through the introduction of a composite gauge field strength @xmath32 .",
    "a useful identity is @xmath33 , which follows from the fact that @xmath34 .",
    "its proportionality to @xmath8 follows from the fact that the latter is perpendicular to @xmath35 ( since @xmath8 is a unit three - vector ) .",
    "the action is given up to an overall factor by @xmath36 brought to this simple form by a suitable rescaling of @xmath37 .",
    "finite energy requires @xmath13 to approach a constant vector at spatial infinity . in this way static configurations are classified by the topological maps from @xmath14 into @xmath16 , characterised by the hopf invariant .",
    "the two - form @xmath38 implicitly defines an abelian gauge field one - form @xmath39 through @xmath40 , in terms of which the hopf invariant is given by @xmath41 .",
    "remarkably , the energy is bounded by a fractional power of this hopf invariant  @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "this gives a rough bound , which can be improved on  @xcite ( by roughly a factor 2 ) .",
    "extensive numerical studies  @xcite have gone up to @xmath44 , with energies indeed following the fractional power of @xmath45 .      we reformulate the non - linear sigma model in two steps , both well known  @xcite .",
    "the first involves @xmath46 fields .",
    "its main advantage is that the abelian gauge field appearing in the hopf invariant , no longer needs to be defined implicitly . to be specific",
    ", one introduces a complex two - component field @xmath47 , also having unit length .",
    "a further phase is removed by the local abelian gauge invariance , obvious from the following relation to the @xmath27 field : @xmath48 the abelian gauge invariance of the @xmath46 model leads to a composite gauge field @xmath49 and one verifies that indeed @xmath50 .",
    "useful identities for these computations are the completeness relation @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eo3 ] ) , becomes @xmath53 with @xmath54 the covariant derivative .",
    "next we make use of the fact that any complex two - component vector of unit length is in one to one relation to an @xmath0 group element .",
    "alternatively we can write @xmath55 . for convenience",
    "we choose @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 we introduce @xmath58 , which can be interpreted as the components of an @xmath0 gauge connection with vanishing curvature , that is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the zero non - abelian field strength leads to @xmath63 , or @xmath64 in terms of @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that @xmath66 , and substituting @xmath67 one finds that the hopf invariant is exactly equal  @xcite to the winding number of the gauge function @xmath19 , @xmath68 using that @xmath69 has zero curvature , we can of course also relate the hopf invariant to the non - abelian chern - simons form , giving @xmath70 \\equiv\\!cs(j)$ ] .",
    "the natural question to ask now , is what the interpretation of the energy functional becomes in terms of the non - abelian gauge field @xmath71 where the index @xmath72 and @xmath73 run only over 1 and 2 . with the absence of the neutral component , @xmath74",
    ", the @xmath75 formulation is evident .",
    "it defines a positive definite functional on the gauge orbit , and its minimum can thus be seen as a particular ( non - linear ) maximal abelian gauge fixing , leaving the abelian subgroup generated by @xmath76 unfixed  @xcite .",
    "as the reparametrisation is mathematically equivalent , we are entitled to interpret the minima of the energy functional in the sector with a given value of @xmath45 as gauge fixed pure gauge ( i.e. curvature free , or flat ) connections in a sector with gauge field winding number @xmath45 . therefore , there is a gauge fixing in terms of which the gauge vacua with different winding number can be characterised by inequivalent knots .",
    "we thus conclude that instantons  knit \" , interpolating between different types of  knots \" .",
    "the relation between @xmath11 and flat @xmath0 gauge fields can also be understood from geometric quantisation on @xmath24 and chiral models , but the relation to gauge fixing was only noted recently  @xcite . finding the _ absolute _ minimum of a gauge fixing functional",
    "is known to be a hard problem , seemingly reflected in the difficulty of finding the knots with the lowest energy for a given value of @xmath45 , as clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "2 of ref .",
    "@xcite      much work has been invested in interpreting this model as an effective low - energy representation of @xmath0 gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "the quality of this approximation is being investigating by inverse monte carlo techniques  @xcite .",
    "amongst other things , these numerical results have reported the presence of the unwanted massless goldstone bosons , if one does not include terms that explicitly break the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "also a perturbative renormalisation group study showed there are difficulties with the restricted formulation of the model , as an effective description of @xmath0 gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "as we will argue , this difficulty seems to be related to the fact that one expands around a background that is actually unstable .",
    "the conventional starting point in these studies is based on the decomposition  @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 describes an abelian gauge field and @xmath79 are the charged components of the field , with respect to @xmath80 .",
    "one attempts to integrate out both @xmath79 _ and _ , unlike in abelian projection , @xmath78 . in perturbation",
    "theory this amounts to a background field calculation . for later use",
    "we consider the one parameter family of backgrounds @xmath81 . for @xmath82 @xmath8",
    "is covariantly constant , i.e. @xmath83 , which remains true when adding @xmath84 to the background .",
    "it ensures that the abelian gauge field transforms properly under gauge transformations after abelian projection  @xcite . to address the issue of perturbative stability , we compute the field strength for general @xmath85 , @xmath86 which is non - zero for @xmath82 .",
    "the energy of this background field is proportional to @xmath87 and actually has a local maximum at @xmath82 , and hence is unstable . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy of the background vanishes not only for @xmath88 ( the trivial background ) , but also for @xmath89 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the flat connection @xmath69 that has topological charge equal to @xmath45 , given by the integral of the non - abelian chern - simons form over space . rescaling the flat connection @xmath69 with",
    "@xmath90 one easily finds its value for any @xmath85 , @xmath91 . for @xmath82 , this relation between the hopf invariant and the non - abelian chern - simons form",
    "can also be found in ref .",
    "we note that the integral gives half the hopf invariant for @xmath82 , thus in some sense this background is  half - way \" between two vacua .    for @xmath92 the ( flat )",
    "background is useful in separating the gauge field in its different topological sectors , since small fluctuations parametrised by @xmath78 and @xmath79 do not change the value of the winding number . with what we could call the faddeev - niemi gauge fixing , such a separation in different topological sectors is now possible in _ localised _ form , without having to appeal to the _ asymptotics _ of the gauge field .",
    "this may lead to new tools and insights to deal with the non - trivial topology of non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "we now turn our attention to finite temperature instantons ( calorons ) with a polyakov loop , @xmath93 in the periodic gauge @xmath94 , non - trivial at spatial infinity ( specifying the holonomy ) .",
    "it implies the spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetry . for a charge one @xmath28 caloron ,",
    "their are @xmath27 constituent monopoles  @xcite .",
    "locations of constituents monopoles can be identified through : + @xmath95 points where two eigenvalues of the polyakov loop coincide , which is where the @xmath96 symmetry is partially restored to @xmath97 .",
    "+ @xmath95 the centers of mass of the ( spherical ) lumps .",
    "+ @xmath95 the dirac monopoles ( or rather dyons , due to self - duality ) as the sources of the abelian field lines , extrapolated back to the cores .",
    "+ if well separated and localised , all these coincide  @xcite .",
    "this is no longer the case when two constituents come close together , as shown for @xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for @xmath1 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the locations of the constituent monopoles may be chosen at will , but their masses are fixed by the eigenvalues of @xmath98 .",
    "these eigenvalues can be ordered by a constant gauge transformation @xmath99 & & -3 mm w_^w_== , + & & -3mm_1  _n_n+11+_1,[eq : hol ] with @xmath100 . using the classical scale invariance to put the extent of the euclidean time direction to one , @xmath101 , the masses of the constituent monopoles are now given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "similarly we can bring @xmath104 to the diagonal form , with eigenvalues ordered on the circle , by a _ local _ gauge function , @xmath105 .",
    "we note that @xmath106 ( unique up to a residual abelian gauge rotation ) and @xmath107 will be smooth , except where two ( or more ) eigenvalues coincide .",
    "the ordering shows there are @xmath27 different types of singularities ( called defects  @xcite ) , for each of the _ neighbouring _ eigenvalues to coincide .",
    "the first @xmath108 are associated with the basic monopoles ( as part of the inequivalent @xmath0 subgroups related to the generators of the cartan subgroup ) .",
    "the @xmath109 defect arises when the first and the last eigenvalue ( still neighbours on the circle ) coincide .",
    "its magnetic charge ensures charge neutrality of the caloron , and it carries the taubes winding supporting the non - zero topological charge  @xcite .",
    "the topological charge can be reduced to surface integrals near the singularities with the use of @xmath110 , where @xmath111 .",
    "if one assumes _ all _ defects are pointlike , this can be used to show that for each of the @xmath27 types the ( net ) number of defects has to equal the topological charge , the type being selected by the branch of the logarithm ( associated with the @xmath27 elements in the center )  @xcite .",
    "this is the generic situation , but in special cases defects may form a submanifold , as we will find for a global embedding of the @xmath0 caloron in @xmath1",
    ".      one might expect defects to merge when constituent monopoles do .",
    "the resulting triple degeneracy of eigenvalues for @xmath1 implies that the polyakov loop takes on a value in the center .",
    "yet this can be shown _ not _ to occur for the @xmath1 caloron with _",
    "unequal _ masses .",
    "we therefore seem to have ( at least ) one more defect than the number of constituents , when two merging constituents will manifest themselves as one constituent .",
    "to study what happens in this case we first recall the simple formula for the @xmath28 action density  @xcite & & -6mmf_^2(x)=_^2_^2 , + & & -6mm_m(r_m&|y_m -y_m+1| + 0&r_m+1 ) ( c_m&s_m + s_m&c_m),[eq : act ] with @xmath112 the center of mass location of the @xmath113 constituent monopole .",
    "we defined @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , as well as @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "we are interested in the case where the problem of two coinciding constituents in @xmath28 is mapped to the @xmath119 caloron . for this",
    "we restrict to the case where @xmath120 for some @xmath121 , which for @xmath1 is _ always _ the case when two constituents coincide .",

    "we will study in detail a generic example in @xmath1 , with @xmath125 .",
    "[ fig : prof ] shows the action density both for non - coinciding constituents and when moving the first constituent to the location of the second .",
    "we denote by @xmath126 the position associated with the @xmath113 constituent , where two eigenvalues of the polyakov loop coincide ( the defect locations ) .",
    "numerically it was established that  @xcite , in the gauge where @xmath127 ( see eq .",

    "now we take @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the limit of coinciding constituents is achieved by @xmath132 . in very good approximation ,",
    "as long as the first two constituents remain well separated from the third constituent ( carrying the taubes winding ) , @xmath133 will be constant in @xmath134 and the @xmath1 gauge field  @xcite of the first two constituents will be constant in time ( in the periodic gauge ) .",

    "for our example , @xmath167 indeed verifies this equation .",
    "[ fig : gen ] gives the spurious location as a function of the mass difference of the two coinciding constituents .",
    "we find that only when this difference _",

    "the defect is always spurious , but it tends to stay within reach of the non - abelian core of the coinciding constituent monopoles , @xmath170 , except when the mass difference approaches its extremal values @xmath171 . at these extremal values",
    "one of the @xmath1 constituents becomes massless and _ delocalised _ , which we excluded for @xmath141 .    actually , the limit @xmath132 is singular due to the _ global _ decomposition into @xmath172 at @xmath140 .",

    "topology is important for the non - perturbative understanding of non - abelian gauge theories , because it forces one to take serious that the configuration space is non - trivial  @xcite . that this has a role to play in the quantum theory",
    "can be easily understood from the difference between quantisation on the line versus the circle .",
    "attempts to _ localise _ topology by gauge fixing ( and its defects ) , should always be treated with healthy suspicion .",
    "this is illustrated by our interpretation of the knotted solitons in the faddeev - niemi model in terms of a non - linear maximal abelian gauge fixing of the gauge vacuum : there is nothing _ physical _ to be localised in a classical vacuum .",
    "also we have shown that the notion of abelian projected monopoles has to be considered with care . for  smooth \" configurations and  reasonable \" choices of projections defects",
    "may well be correlated to action lumps , but this is by no means guaranteed . furthermore , the defects can at best serve as bare quantities , which need to be dressed by the quantum corrections .",
    "what is perhaps more important is that we learn that instantons and monopoles are closely connected , and should not be viewed in isolation . in disordered field configurations ,",
    "gauge dislocations are likely to occur  @xcite . in four dimensions these are instantons ( point dislocations ) , monopoles ( line dislocations ) and vortices ( surface dislocations ) . even when there is a ( sufficient ) separation of scales , the problem remains how to isolate the effective low energy degrees of freedom in a reliable manner .",
