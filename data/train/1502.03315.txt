    "the investigation of the stellar and dust content of galaxies is mainly based on the analysis of the multiwavelength uv - to - submm emission spectra of the radiation escaping from galaxies and received by ground  based and space observatories .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the emission detected at these wavelengths , integrated over the entire galaxy or from specific regions within a galaxy , is an essential requirement for studies of star formation on galactic scales as well as for studies of galaxy evolution . except for the possible presence of a bright active galactic nucleus",
    ", the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the uv - to - submm continuum emission of a galaxy is determined by the intrinsic distribution of stars and dust within the galaxy : the stars emit uv - to - near  ir radiation , whose spectra depends mainly on their intrinsic mass , age and metallicity ; the interstellar dust particles absorb and scatter a fraction of the radiation coming from stars ( or from other dust particles ) and re - emit the absorbed luminosity in the infrared range .",
    "the amount of radiation absorbed and scattered by dust particles , as well as their emission spectra , are determined by the relative geometry between stars and dust , the optical properties of the dust grains , the dust abundance and the stellar luminosity .",
    "therefore , the output radiation sed along a particular line - of - sight within a galaxy is the product of a large variety of physical factors .    in principle , at least some of the information contained within the observed emission sed of a galaxy can be extracted by comparing observed and predicted seds for a set of galaxy models ( either analytical or derived from numerical simulations ) .",
    "this comparison requires the identification of sufficiently realistic galaxy models and dust radiative transfer ( rt ) calculations needed to predict their emission seds .",
    "however , this approach is still not commonly adopted for the analysis of galaxy data because of the intricacies in either calculating or empirically determining the relative distribution of stars and dust , the large number of parameters that need to be constrained and the high computational effort to perform those calculations . instead ,",
    "simpler techniques are routinely used to derive estimates of intrinsic stellar and/or dust parameters , such as combined stellar and dust emission sed fitting ( e.g. da cunha et al .",

    "2013 and references therein . ) . however , all these techniques are unable to consider 1 ) the effect of non local contributions to the scattered and dust reradiated starlight at specific positions within a galaxy , 2 ) the intrinsic geometry of stellar and dust distribution and 3 ) the differences in observed emission due to different galaxy inclinations .",
    "all these aspects can be taken into account only by performing rt calculations .    in order to interpret galaxy seds ,",
    "the use of galaxy models combined with radiation transfer calculations can follow two different approaches ( see popescu & tuffs 2010 , pt10 ) .",
    "the first approach ( called `` decoding observed panchromatic seds '' in pt10 ) consists of performing a fit to the observed multiwavelength seds of galaxies by using a grid of galaxy models , whose stellar and dust component distributions are described by analytical functions .",
    "this approach allows the distribution of stars and dust within galaxies to be empirically constrained .",
    "this method was pioneered and calibrated for nearby edge - on galaxies by xilouris et al .",
    "( 1997,1998,1999 ) in the optical range , and by popescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the multiwavelength uv / optical - fir / submm range .",
    "further applications of this method to individual galaxies have also mainly focused on edge - on galaxies , which have been decomposed in terms of axisymmetric stellar and dust components , often including a clumpy component and/or spiral arms ( see e.g. baes et al .",

    "the second approach ( called `` encoding predicted physical quantities '' by pt10 ) consists of the application of dust radiative transfer codes to galaxy models obtained through numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in contrast to the decoding approach , in this case the stellar and dust distributions are derived from first principles .",
    "the seds of the simulated galaxy have been used by several authors to elucidate the dependence of multiwavelength emission from galaxies on their intrinsic physical properties ( e.g. hayward et al .",

    "one advantage of performing radiative transfer calculations for numerically simulated galaxies , which has not been considered very much so far , is that one can also study the predicted observed properties of these galaxies on local scales .",
    "this is possible provided that both the galaxy simulation and the rt calculation are performed at sufficiently high spatial resolution .",
    "the more detailed distributions of stars and dust in the numerically simulated galaxies , compared to the simplified galaxy models used in the first approach , makes these rt calculations particularly amenable for the study of attenuation and scattering of stellar light as well as of dust heating and emission on local scales .",
    "however , one should note that the entire approach relies on the input physics assumed for both the galaxy numerical simulation and the radiation transfer calculations being complete and able to resolve all relevant physical processes .",
    "in this paper we follow the second approach . specifically , we present an application of dart - ray , a purely ray - tracing 3d dust radiative transfer code presented in natale et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , to a high resolution galaxy n - body+sph simulation .",
    "this work has the following main purposes .",
    "firstly , we show how we included in dart - ray an efficient method for the calculation of the stochastically heated dust emission by implementing an approach based on the construction of an adaptive library of dust emission seds .",
    "then , we show the full 3d capabilities of dart - ray by applying it to predict the emergent radiation from a complex and highly resolved model of a galaxy .",
    "we use the results of this specific rt calculation to perform an example study of the dust attenuation , scattering , heating and emission on both global and local scales , which can be used as a generic framework for future similar studies .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the main characteristics of the rt algorithm implemented in dart - ray and we present the procedure we implemented to include the calculation of the stochastically heated dust emission . in section 3",
    "we describe a method to determine the relative fraction of dust emission powered by young and old stellar populations for a given galaxy model ( which we use in this work for the analysis of the dust heating properties ) . in section 4",
    "we describe the details of the simulated galaxy rt calculation we perform for this work . in section 5",
    "we present the predicted galaxy maps and we show the results for the dust attenuation , scattering and heating properties .",
    "a summary closes the paper .",
    "note that additional plots and figures for several sections can be found in the appendix .",
    "the calculation of dust emission requires an accurate knowledge of the radiation fields through the entire volume of the galaxies , including regions of low illumination . indeed ,",
    "far - infrared(fir)/submm observations of spiral galaxies show that most of the dust emission luminosity is emitted longwards of 100 micron ( see e.g. sodroski et al .",
    "1997 , odenwald et al .",
    "1998 , popescu et al .",
    "2002 , popescu & tuffs 2002 , dale et al .",
    "2007 , 2012 , bendo et al . 2012 ) through grains situated in the diffuse ism , which are generally located at very considerable distances from the stars heating the dust .",
    "in addition , infrared radiation shortwards of 100@xmath0 m is also known to have a significant contribution from small grains out of equilibrium with the radiation fields of low energy densities , the so  called stochastically heated grains .",
    "one of the motivations for developing dart - ray was specifically to provide a tool for accurately determining radiation fields in galaxies for the calculation of dust emission .",
    "the determination of the radiation fields has been described in natale et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , together with the detailed description of the rt algorithm . in this section",
    "we briefly recap some of the main features of the rt algorithm ( sect.[dr_rt_algo ] ) , before describing the dust emission calculations including the stochastically heating mechanism ( sect.[non_lte_dust_sect ] ) .",
    "dart - ray is a purely ray - tracing 3d dust radiative transfer code , described in detail in natale et al .",
    "the algorithm implemented in this code shares with the more common 3d monte - carlo rt algorithms the aim of determining the contribution of each radiation source to the radiation field energy density ( rfed ) in regions within the model volume where this contribution is `` significant '' ( in the sense that it can not be neglected in order to calculate accurately the rfed at a certain position ) .",
    "however , instead of using random numbers and probability functions to determine the location of the emission and the propagation of photons within the model volume , the rt algorithm implemented in dart - ray exploits the concept of `` source influence volume '' to decide where to follow the propagation of radiation from each source . the `` source influence volume '' is defined as the volume which is significantly illuminated by a source of direct or scattered radiation within a galaxy model .",
    "the dart - ray algorithm identifies regions including the influence volume for each source and calculates the source rfed contributions only within them .",
    "this procedure becomes gradually more efficient when sources of higher order scattered light are considered , since their influence volumes tend to become smaller and smaller at each scattering iteration . on the other hand , for the purpose of calculating the escaping radiation from the model ,",
    "the code calculates for each volume element ( `` cell '' ) how much of the initial monochromatic specific intensity @xmath1 , determined by direct or scattered radiation sources within the volume element , is escaping from the system .",
    "this is done by multiplying @xmath1 by a factor @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the optical depth from the cell to the border of the model along the direction ( @xmath4 ) ( this procedure is similar to the so called `` peel - off '' technique implemented in modern monte - carlo codes to make them more efficient in creating galaxy images , see review by steinacker et al .",
    "the specific intensity of the radiation escaping from the model is calculated for a set of directions , specified by the user in the input , and is stored for each cell .",
    "this can then be used to create galaxy images by using 3d volume rendering .",
    "further characteristics of the dart - ray code include an adaptive cartesian 3d spatial grid , an iterative procedure to optimize the angular density of the rays launched from each cell , the treatment of anisotropic scattering and parallelization using openmp .",
    "each run of the code is performed separately for each wavelength . in the output of the code both the monochromatic rfed and the outgoing radiation specific intensity for each cell",
    "are provided for the direct and scattered radiation separately .",
    "the total rfed distribution can then be used to calculate the dust emission from each cell , assuming that the dust is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field or is stochastically heated . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the method implemented to perform the dust emission calculation in the latter case .      in order to obtain realistic predictions of the dust emission sed in galaxies ,",
    "an important physical phenomena that has to be taken into account is the stochastic heating of the dust grains which regards dust particles out of equilibrium with the heating radiation field . in this case , the emission sed from each grain can not be modelled as a single temperature modified black body spectrum .",
    "stochastical heating can not be neglected when the energies carried by the photons absorbed by the grain are comparable to , or exceed , the grain enthalpy .",
    "this occurs when the grain cooling times are shorter than the time needed for another photon to be absorbed .",
    "these conditions can be realized when grains have very small sizes ( that is , @xmath5  ) , the radiation fields are weak ( as in the case of the local interstellar radiation field ) or because of the hardness of the radiation field spectra ( see siebermorgen et al .",
    "1992 ) . as a result",
    ", dust grains can experience large temperature fluctuations and their infrared emission tends in general to be warmer than expected from their equilibrium temperature .",
    "the calculation of the emission spectra from stochastically heated grains consists of two steps . in the first step",
    ", one has to determine the probability distribution for the temperature of grains of different sizes and composition . in the second step ,",
    "one calculates the emission from each grain based on the inferred temperature probability distribution and integrates over the assumed dust size distribution and the different grain species . in this work",
    "we perform these calculations as in popescu et al .",
    "( 2011 , hereafter p11 ) .",
    "the temperature probability distribution is calculated following voit ( 1991 ) , based on the numerical integration method of guhathakurta & draine ( 1989 ) .",
    "the calculation for stochastically heated grains is performed for all grain sizes , except for grains with very narrow temperature probability distribution which are assumed to be at equilibrium .",
    "a gaussian approximation for the temperature distribution of grains close to equilibrium ( see voit 1991 ) is used to determine the transition between equilibrium and stochastical heating regimes .",
    "we also assumed the dust model of weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) for the milky way dust ( with @xmath6 ) , modified by draine & li ( 2007 ) .    for a given dust model and radiation field energy density spectra , the calculation of the stochastically heated dust emission requires of order of few seconds using a single processor on a typical modern computer .",
    "this calculation time is not a concern when the calculation is performed for 2d galaxy models , where the number of grid points is of order of @xmath7 .",
    "however , a brute force approach , where the exact calculation is performed at each grid point , becomes inconvenient for 3d galaxy models , where the number of grid points can be of order of @xmath8 .",
    "various authors have followed different strategies to reduce the time needed for dust stochastic heating calculations , once a radiation field distribution has been inferred using a radiative transfer code .",

    "( 1992 ) and misselt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) assume that stochastic heating needs to be calculated only for grains smaller than a certain size ( @xmath9  ) .",
    "bianchi et al . ( 2008 ) adopt an approach using the same temperature bins for all grid points and grain sizes , when computing the temperature probability distribution .",
    "this allows the tabulation of some quantities often used in the calculation .",

    "( 2011 ) , further developing an approach first proposed by juvela & padoan ( 2003 ) , construct a dust emission sed adaptive library for a given rt calculation , which is derived by grouping the inferred radiation field spectra in bins of similar equilibrium dust temperatures and effective wavelengths ( see their section 3.5.2 ) .",
    "then they calculate the dust emission spectra from the average of the radiation field spectra in each bin . the use of these two parameters to construct the sed adaptive library allowed those authors to approximately consider both the intensity and spectral shape of the radiation field , unlike the simpler approach of wood et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and jonsson et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    as in baes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we use a dust emission sed adaptive library approach which can be built for a given radiation field energy density distribution @xmath10 inferred by a radiative transfer calculation performed on a certain galaxy model .",

    "integrated radiation field energy densities in the uv and in the optical / infrared regime .",
    "these are and @xmath11 .",
    "this is because we are neglecting dust self - heating in our calculations .",
    "this should be a good approximation for galaxies , since they are typically optically thin in the infrared .",
    "however , if this effect were to be included , our method could be extended to include the integrated infrared radiation field energy density as a separate parameter . ] : @xmath12 and @xmath13 unlike baes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , this approach explicitly takes into account the optical - to - uv ratio of the radiation field intensity at each position .",
    "the motivation for our approach is that for any fixed equilibrium dust temperature there can be a range of ratios of uv to optical light , each yielding a different dust emission sed .",
    "our method consists of the following steps : + 1 ) we calculate the total uv and optical / infrared radiation field energy densities , @xmath14 and @xmath15 at each grid volume element ( `` cell '' ) ; + 2 ) we bin the inferred range of values covered by @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; + 3 ) we consider all the grid cells whose @xmath14 and @xmath15 values fall into the same two - dimensional bin and we average their radiation field spectra ; + 4 ) we calculate for each @xmath16 $ ] bin the stochastically heated dust emission spectra per unit dust mass by using the average radiation field spectra calculated in step 3 ; + 5 ) we assign to each cell the dust emission spectra , scaled by the cell dust mass , derived for the @xmath16 $ ] bin corresponding to the cell @xmath14 and @xmath15 values .    in order to test the accuracy of this approximation , we have compared the results of the time - consuming brute force approach ( where the calculation is performed exactly for the rfed spectra of each cell ) with those obtained using the sed adaptive library approach described above .",
    "specifically , we tested these two approaches for two different rfed distributions , derived assuming the axisymmetric galaxy model geometry defined in p11 .",
    "in the first test , we considered the rfed distribution calculated by including only the thick stellar disc ( we set the luminosity scaling parameters `` old '' and `` sfr '' to old=1 and sfr=0@xmath17 , see p11 for definitions ) . in the second test , we considered the rfed distribution derived by including only the thin stellar disc ( parameters old=0 and sfr=1@xmath17 ) . for both tests we assumed that the dust is distributed within two dust discs ( the thick and the thin dust disc from p11 ) with a total face - on central optical depth in the b - band @xmath18 .",
    "we derived the rfed distributions for the two tests by performing radiative transfer calculations at all wavelengths tabulated in table e.2 of p11 .",
    "then , we calculated the stochastically heated dust emission using both the brute force and the adaptive library approach for each of the two cases .",
    "since the thick stellar disc does not emit in the uv ( see table e.2 of p11 ) , in the test including only this component we considered only @xmath11 when constructing the dust emission library .",
    "the top panel of fig.[int_sed_comp ] shows the integrated dust emission seds for both the brute force approach and the sed adaptive library approach for this test .",
    "the integrated seds are remarkably close to each other . in fig.[rel_diff_old ] we also show for this test , where the illumination is only by the thick stellar disc , histograms of the number of cells with a given relative difference between the results of the two methods for the dust emission flux at 24 and 100@xmath19 .",
    "this shows that there are differences of order of a few percent for the predicted fluxes for the single cells . in the test including only the thin stellar disc , we calculate both @xmath20 and @xmath11 since the thin stellar disc emits from the uv to optical / infrared wavelengths .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.[int_sed_comp ] shows the integrated sed obtained by the two methods for this test and fig.[rel_diff_sfr ] shows the corresponding histograms of the number of cells as a function of the 24 and 100@xmath0 m relative flux differences .",
    "the accuracy achieved is comparable with that of the previous test . for both the thick and thin stellar disk we also derived histograms of the numbers of cells as a function of the 8 @xmath0 m relative flux differences ( not shown in this paper ) , which we find to be similar to the histograms at 24 micron .",
    "the results of these tests suggest that the adaptive library approach we designed is a reliable shortcut to calculate the stochastically heated dust emission for galaxy models .",
    "in fact , this method allows us to calculate a factor 10 - 100 less dust emission spectra than by using the brute force approach but still preserving a good accuracy for the final results .",
    "however , one should also note that the use of axisymmetric distributions of stellar emissivity and dust opacity for these tests simplifies the distribution of rfed within the 3d galaxy model , since there will be many cells having exactly the same radiation field spectra .",
    "nonetheless , this test suggests that it is quite accurate to use averages of similar rfed spectra instead of using the exact values for each cell . in this case",
    "only a few percent difference for the monochromatic dust emission is found on a cell  by  cell basis while the integrated sed is recovered to within 1% accuracy .",
    "in addition , within a real galaxy a certain degree of axisymmetry and/or similarity in the distribution of the rfed spectra is expected .    .",

    "but for the thin disc test . ]",
    "it is of great interest to know which stellar populations ( sps ) are responsible for powering the dust emission in galaxies .",
    "many authors have tried to address this question , mainly relying on simple geometrical comparisons between the surface brightness distributions at different wavelengths ( e.g. boquien et al .",
    "2011 , bendo et al .",
    "such comparisons make the implicit assumption that the stellar emissivity within the resolution element of the telescope dominates the heating of the dust which is visible in the same telescope beam . however , this assumption will break down when radiation fields are not dominated by local sources , but instead by distributed sources , offset by more than the resolution element .",
    "quantitative determination of radiation fields provided by all contributing sources can only be achieved by following the transfer of radiation within these objects . in this context dart - ray",
    "can be used as a generic tool to examine exactly this question .    in this section",
    "we describe a general method to evaluate which stellar populations are responsible for powering the dust emission as a function of position and infrared wavelength .",
    "this method is in principle applicable to any radiation transfer code and any galaxy model / simulation .",
    "the method we present here is an extension of the procedure used by popescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to elucidate the fraction of the dust emission in ngc891 powered by uv photons as a function of infrared wavelength .",
    "the procedure we adopt here involves the calculation of the radiation fields due to all the stellar populations in the galaxy , but also additional calculations of the radiation fields due to either young or old sps .",
    "the input grid for the additional rt run can be created by considering only the emission from stellar populations with ages younger or older than a threshold age @xmath21 . in this way",
    "one can determine the rfed contributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 due to young and old sps to the total rfed in each cell ( one contribution can be derived directly from the new rt run and the other by subtraction to the total rfed ) .",
    "from the values of @xmath22 and @xmath24 one can then derive the luminosity coming from young and old sps which is absorbed in each cell : @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the absorption coefficient per unit dust mass for the adopted dust model and @xmath28 is the dust mass in the cell .",
    "instead , the total absorbed luminosity in each cell @xmath29 is equal to the sum of the above absorbed luminosities : @xmath30 since dust simply re - emits all the luminosity that it absorbs , the total bolometric dust emission luminosity and the contributions powered by young and old sps are equal to @xmath29 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "therefore , one can use those quantities to calculate the relative fractions of dust emission luminosity powered by the two sps for each cell as well as for the entire model .",
    "while determining the amount of the dust bolometric luminosity powered by young and old sps is quite straightforward , it is rather more complex to determine their relative contributions to the dust emission luminosity at single infrared wavelengths .",
    "in contrast to the bolometric case , one can not simply calculate the amount of dust emission by considering @xmath22 and @xmath23 separately and then sum the inferred dust emission spectra in order to obtain the total dust emission .",
    "this is because the dust emission spectra of each grain depends non linearly from the rfeds and , thus , it has to be calculated from the total rfed ( given by the sum of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "also , when calculating the relative fraction of monochromatic luminosity powered by young and old sps , it is necessary to consider the emission spectra from the single grains .",
    "the reason is that young and old sps emit predominantly in different regions of the uv to near - ir wavelength range and , at the same time , dust grains have wavelength dependent absorption coefficients determined by their size and composition .",
    "therefore , different grains can be more or less efficient in absorbing radiation from young or old sps .",
    "finally , when considering the emission spectra of a single grain , one can assume that the fraction of the emission at a single wavelength powered by young / old sps is equal to their relative contribution to the single grain bolometric emission .",
    "this is because one can assume that all photons heat the grain simultaneously and the absorbed luminosity is simply redistributed in the grain emission spectra .",
    "for all these reasons , one can use the following procedure for each single cell : + 1 ) calculate the monochromatic luminosity @xmath33 at wavelength @xmath34 as well as the bolometric luminosity @xmath35 for each grain of size @xmath36 and grain species @xmath37 , assuming the total rfed value ( including contributions from both young and old sps ) ;    \\2 ) calculate the bolometric dust luminosity powered by young stellar populations @xmath38 for each grain size and species .",

    "interestingly , we notice that at wavelengths shorter than 60@xmath19 the dust emission is dominated by young sp heating .",
    "this is due to several factors : the stochastical heating of the small grains which have higher cross sections for uv photons and tend to emit in the mir ; the contribution to the mir from hot dust close to very young sps ; the mir line emission from pah molecules predominantly powered by uv photons . for wavelengths longer than about 60@xmath19",
    "the old sps provide more heating than the young sps , which nevertheless still contribute about 40 - 45% of the total fir / submm emission .",
    "+ although the dust content and distribution of the simulated galaxy has some peculiar characteristics compared to that typically observed in nearby normal spiral galaxies ( see section [ res_sect_intrinsic ] ) , the above results provide qualitative hints about the reliability of infrared star formation rate ( sfr ) indicators .",
    "these tracers can be considered robust if the majority of the dust emission is powered by young sps and if the dust emission luminosity is proportional to the young sp luminosity . from the values given above one",
    "can realize that , although the young sps power only half of the bolometric dust emission , the additional heating from old sps is such that the total dust luminosity is approximately equal to the total young sp luminosity ( within 4% ) . therefore , even if the young sps are not completely obscured , measuring the bolometric dust luminosity of this galaxy would be a good way to derive the intrinsic young sp luminosity and thus the global sfr .",
    "this however may simply be a coincidence since galaxies are known to have varying relative luminosities of old and young sp according to the galaxy mass .",
    "so , it is possible that the infrared luminosity would have a different relation to the sfr for galaxies at different mass .",
    "concerning the reliability of monochromatic infrared tracers of sfr , we notice from our simulation that the fraction of heating due to young sps varies substantially over the infrared wavelength range ( as shown in fig.[fig_dust_em_sed ] ) . in principle , the mid - infrared range ( 1 - 30@xmath0 m ) seems to be the most appropriate for measuring galaxy sfrs , since the majority of dust emission is powered by young sps in that range .",
    "however , we note that the calibration of sfr tracers at wavelengths coinciding with pah line emission might be difficult because of the known spread in pah abundances among galaxies ( see e.g. draine et al . 2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our results bring clear support for the use of sfr tracers based on the 24@xmath0 m luminosity ( e.g. wu et al .",
    "2005 , rieke et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the range 30 - 100@xmath0 m , the fraction of young sp heating varies quickly .",
    "this makes the use of monochromatic sfr tracer in this range quite problematic .",
    "finally , at wavelengths longer than 100@xmath0 m , our results suggest that sfr tracers can not be based on the assumption that the majority of dust heating is contributed by young sps .         in fig.[galaxy_dust_idir0_rel ]",
    "we show maps of the dust emission powered by young sps , old sps as well as maps of the relative fraction powered by young sps for the face - on view .",
    "interesting features we notice are the following : + ( i ) for the bolometric dust emission maps , the morphology tends to be more clumpy for the dust emission powered by young sps compared to that powered by old sps ; + ( ii ) young sps tend to dominate the heating in some discrete peaks distributed throughout the disc and in the external ring around the nuclear disc ; + ( iii ) as expected , the 24@xmath0 m map shows generally a larger fraction of emission powered by young sps at every position compared to the other maps ; + in the panels of fig.[prof_young_idir0 ] we show the radial average profile for the relative fraction of the young sp powered dust emission and the radial density profile for the young sp powered dust luminosity .",
    "we notice that : + ( i ) the peak of the young sp powered dust luminosity density is at the exterior part of the nuclear disc ; + ( ii ) in the nuclear disc the relative fraction of young sp powered dust emission peaks at the external boundary for both the bolometric map and the monochromatic maps . however , the variation between inner and outer parts of the nuclear disc is smoother for the 8 and 24 @xmath0 m maps",
    ". + ( iii ) the spiral disc shows a young sp powered dust emission fraction profile which is oscillating around 40 - 50% except for the 24@xmath0 m case where the average is approximately 70% . from the cumulative fraction radial profile of the young sp powered dust luminosity , shown in fig .",
    "d1 in the appendix , we notice that most ( @xmath7260% ) of the young sp powered dust luminosity is emitted by the nuclear disc for both the bolometric and all the other maps , except the 500@xmath0 m map where the fraction goes down to 50% + ( iv ) at radii larger than 6kpc , the heating of the dust is mainly provided by old sps ( except at 24@xmath0 m ) .            for the maps and radial profiles derived for the inclined view , shown in fig .",
    "d2-d4 of the appendix , we notice essentially the same characteristics for all the maps and radial profiles as for the face - on view .",
    "+ finally , in fig.[galaxy_dust_idir7_rel ] we show the young and old sps powered dust emission maps and the relative fraction of emission due to young sps for the edge - on view .",
    "we notice that : + ( i ) the dust emission powered by young sps is rather more clumpy within the galaxy disc than that powered by old sps ; + ( ii ) as for the face - on and inclined views , the fraction is higher for the 24@xmath0 m emission compared to the other wavelengths and the bolometric emission . + as for the other inclinations , we derived the profiles of the vertical average of the young sp powered dust emission fraction and the young sp powered dust luminosity vertical density and cumulative fraction ( see fig .",
    "d5-d6 in the appendix ) . from these",
    "we see that more than 95% of the young sp powered dust emission luminosity is emitted within 100pc of the galaxy plane .",
    "the fraction of young sp powered dust emission is about 50% in the galaxy plane and goes down to 40% at z=1kpc , with the exception of the 24@xmath0 m map where the fraction goes from 75% to 60% .",
    "in this paper we have extended the capabilities of the 3d ray - tracing rt code dart - ray to include a self - consistent calculation of stochastically heated dust emission , using the same algorithms applied to the axi - symmetric models of popescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and popescu et al .",
    "this calculation can be performed either by using a brute force approach ( where the derivation of the non equilibrium dust emission spectra is performed exactly for each cell ) or by using an adaptive sed library approach . in the latter case ,",
    "dust emission spectra are derived for the average rfed of the cells having similar wavelength ",
    "integrated uv and optical rfeds .",
    "the spectra so calculated are then assigned to the corresponding cells with similar rfeds .",
    "we also gave a general prescription for the calculation of the fraction of dust emission powered by different stellar populations in a galaxy .",
    "this prescription is in principle applicable to any radiation transfer code and any galaxy model / simulation .",
    "it was already used in the calculations from popescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , although the method was never described before .    to show the full capabilities of the code",
    ", we used dart - ray to derive the stellar and non equilibrium dust emission maps of a high - resolution n - body+sph galaxy simulation for different wavelengths and inclinations .",
    "the derived maps have been used to perform an analysis of the dust attenuation , scattering and heating properties of the simulated galaxy . this analysis has confirmed several features which have been previously quantitatively investigated only with axi - symmetric models . in particular this analysis has highlighted : + ( i ) the importance of dust in modifying the radial and vertical profiles of the perceived stellar emission of the simulated galaxy from those of their intrinsic emission ; + ( ii ) the flattening of the attenuation curve , compared to the extinction curve of the assumed dust model , at high galaxy inclinations .",
    "this effect can be explained in terms of the relative geometry of the stellar and dust distribution without the need of a modified dust model ; + ( iii ) the presence of `` negative attenuation '' on local scales : the observed stellar emission at certain positions within the simulated galaxy is enhanced compared to the emission that would be observed in the absence of dust ; + ( iv ) in the edge - on view , the dust lane obscuring the stars close to the galaxy plane is seen only at optical / near - ir wavelengths but not at uv wavelengths ; + ( v ) the fraction of the total observed emission due to scattered light is less than 20% at all wavelengths .",
    "however , higher fractions of scattered radiation are reached at local positions within and outside the galaxy disc ; + ( vi ) young and old sps power approximately the same amount of total dust emission luminosity , with the young sps providing slightly more heating ( 54% ) .",
    "however , the total dust emission is powered predominantly by young stars for @xmath89 and by old stars for @xmath90 ; + ( vii ) the dust emission powered by young sps present a more clumpy morphology compared to that powered by old sps .",
    "this is due to the predominance of young sps in powering the dust emission in the vicinity of young star formation regions .",
    "we note that uv photons also propagate at large distances from the star formation regions and contribute substantially to the heating of the diffusely distributed dust at all wavelengths .",
