    "the question how can one quantify the complexity of a system often arises in various fields of research . on the one hand , theoretical measures of complexity like the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy @xcite , the lyapunov exponent @xcite and others are not easy to estimate from given data . on the other hand , empirical measures of complexity often lack of a theoretical foundation , see for instance the discussion of the renormalized entropy and its relationship to the kullback - leibler entropy in @xcite .",
