    "the properties of the resulting pbh clusters appear to be strongly dependent on the value of an initial phase of the scalar field .",
    "in addition they depend on the tilt of the potential and the scale of symmetry breaking @xmath8 at the beginning of the inflation . this clusters of pbhs could provide the initial density perturbations for induced protogalaxy formation .    in this paper",

    "the shells near the center are very dense and are detached from the cosmological expansion at the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "the process similar to the secondary accretion could take place for the early formed pbhs . as a result",
    "the pbhs would be enveloped by the dm halo .",
    "we will call these dm haloes the induced protogalaxies .",
    "the density profile does not follow the secondary accretion law @xmath68 because the central mass is not compact .",
    "after virialization the distribution of dm is @xmath69 where function @xmath70 is determined by the solution of ( [ d2bdz1 ] ) . by analogy with the dm case one can obtain the profile of the bhs density and of the total density .",

    "the growing of protogalaxy is terminated at the epoch of nonlinear growth of the ambient density fluctuations with the same mass @xmath71 as a considered system of bhs and dm .",
    "these fluctuations are originated in a standard way from the inflationary cosmological perturbations with the spectrum @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the laws of growth for both types of fluctuations during the matter dominated epoch are very similar .",
    "the condition for the termination of a typical induced protogalaxy growth is @xmath73 the r.h.s of this equation is an amplitude of fluctuation caused by the bh cluster . respectively",
    "the l.h.s . denotes the gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the value of fluctuations produced by the cluster @xmath74 is shown in fig .  [ solgen ] ( right panel ) together with the harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
    "the factor 2.5 corresponds to the entropy perturbation growth to the moment @xmath66 according to the meszaros solution .    numerical solution of ( [ d2bdz1 ] ) and ( [ deltaeq ] ) gives the termination of the protogalaxy growth at the redshift @xmath2 with a final mass of induced protogalaxy @xmath75 .",
    "so the whole range of masses and radii shown at figures is not realized .",
    "after this moment the structure formation proceeds by the standard scenario : small ( ordinary and induced ) protogalaxies are assembled into the larger ones and then into the clusters and superclusters .",
    "being formed , the induced protogalaxies looks like dwarf spheroidal galaxy with a central dm spike shown in the fig .",
    "[ solgen ] and a central bh .",
    "some of these induced protogalaxies could escape merging and survive till now in the form of rare dwarf galaxies .    in previous calculations",
    "we demonstrate that massive induced protogalaxy with the mass @xmath76 is formed around the pbhs cluster at @xmath2 .",
    "there are a lot of smaller neighboring protogalaxies , both ordinary and induced ones , in its vicinity .",
    "the coalescences of these protogalaxies results in the formation of nowadays galaxies .",
    "the induced protogalaxies are massive enough to be settled down to the galactic center during the hubble time under influence of the dynamical friction .",
    "the fate of bhs inside the central few parsecs of the forming host galaxy is rather uncertain .",
    "we will suppose the multiple bhs merging into a single bh during the hubble time .",
    "note that the dynamical friction must supply a very effective mechanism of merging at a final stage because the density of induced protogalaxies @xmath77 strongly growing toward the center up to the small distance @xmath78 from pbh where @xmath79 according ( [ dprofeq ] ) .",
    "for example , according to our calculations @xmath80 is contained within the radius @xmath81  pc providing the density @xmath82  pc@xmath83 . using the chandrasekhar time ( see e.  g. @xcite ) for the dynamical friction of bh with the mass @xmath84 we obtain an estimation for the characteristic time for bh spiralling down from the radius @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "the bhs of a larger mass would be spiralling down even faster . as a result",
    "the late phase of bhs merging lasts very fast and so the probability of simultaneous existence in the galactic nucleus of three or more bhs is rather low .",
    "thus as rule the galactic center contains only a single supermassive bh . on the contrary ,",
    "a galaxy as a whole could contain a substantial amount of massive pbhs which were nucleated initially far from the galactic center @xcite .    finally let us calculate the growth of the central bh under the process of the two - body relaxation of surrounding smaller bhs in the inner region of the induced protogalaxy .",
    "the bhs cluster is composed of the bhs of different masses .",
    "so the important factor of relaxation evolution is the mass segregation : the concentration of more massive bhs at center of the cluster .",
    "this makes the comprehensive analytical treatment very complicated .",
    "we use an approximate approach by considering bhs of different masses as independent homological subsystems evolving in a total gravitational field .",
    "this approach is widely used in a study of evolution of the multicomponent star clusters .",
    "the time of two - body relaxation is @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a virial velocity , @xmath89 , @xmath90 is a total number of bhs and @xmath91 is a number density of bhs inside the shell respectively . in the evaporating model @xcite the lifetime of the cluster @xmath92 .",
    "the gravitational collapse of the remaining cluster begins when a central part of the cluster reached the relativistic state .",
    "a mean value of @xmath93 is calculated and expressed through a redshift @xmath18 from the relation @xmath94 .",
    "the corresponding relaxed shells are collapsing and merging with a central bh ( having initial mass @xmath95 ) .",
    "it appears that collapse of an additional shells gives rather small contribution the mass of a central bh . indeed",
    ", the mass of a central bh to the moment @xmath2 of the growth termination of induced protogalaxies is @xmath96 . at the moment",
    "( when galaxies with the mass @xmath98 are formed ) the bh mass is @xmath99 .",
    "if the induced galaxy is survived up to nowadays ( @xmath100 ) , it has a central bh with the mass @xmath101 .",
    "so we expect that the main contributions to the mass growing come from the accretion of surrounding media and the merging of the central bhs of the coalesced induced protogalaxies .",
    "in this paper we describe the new model of galaxy formation initiated by the cluster of primordial black holes .",
    "clusters of different total mass may be formed through the mechanism of massive primordial bhs formation @xcite .",
    "respectively the described induced protogalaxies would have the different masses . for numerical calculations",
    "we choose parameters of pbhs clusters corresponding to the formation of small protogalaxies .",
    "this model predicts the very early epoch of galaxy and quasar formation .",
    "the other prediction is the existence of numerous bhs of intermediate mass beyond the dynamical centers of galaxies and in the intergalactic medium .",
    "one of such bhs may be observed by the chandra telescope in the galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "more definitely , the considered model predicts the formation of induced protogalaxy at @xmath2 with the following parameters : the halo dm mass @xmath102 , the virial radius @xmath103  kpc , the central bh mass @xmath104 and the total bhs mass in the protogalaxy @xmath105 .",
    "we suppose that large galaxies observed now are originated through the hierarchical clustering of these dwarf protogalaxies .",
    "the process of multiple merging occurs in a stochastic manner and leads to the correlations between the central supermassive bhs masses and galactic bulge velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "it is worth to estimate the probability to find a nowadays galaxy without a supermassive bh in the framework of the considered model .",
    "the induced protogalaxies and the most common small protogalaxies produced by the standard inflation scenario have masses around @xmath106 .",
    "meanwhile the nowadays galaxies have masses of the order of @xmath107 .",
    "each collision of an induced protogalaxy with an protogalaxy originated from the standard inflation perturbations produces protogalaxy of the next generation with a massive bh in its center .",
    "so @xmath108 collisions have been happened up to now .",
    "let us suppose that the amount of induces protogalaxies is @xmath109% comparing with the most common ones .",
    "the corresponding probability to find the galaxy without a supermassive bh is much less than @xmath110 .",
