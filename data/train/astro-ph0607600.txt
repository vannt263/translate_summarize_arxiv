    "the interaction of the ism with the fully ionized solar wind gives rise to the heliospheric morphology which includes the heliopause ( hp ) , a tangential discontinuity separating solar wind and lism , and the termination shock ( ts ) where the solar wind becomes subsonic and is diverted downstream to form a heliotail . depending on the pressure of the surrounding interstellar material , an interstellar bow shock ( bs ) may form upwind of the heliopause .",

    "the models of the interaction of the solar wind with the ism are carried out in a heliocentric frame of reference , and are effectively two - dimensional as we assume azimuthal symmetry about the stagnation axis ( the axis parallel to the lism flow that contains the sun ) .",
    "to satisfy this assumption we also neglect heliospheric and interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "the interstellar medium is prescribed as four boundary conditions at a suitably large distance from the sun ( a typical value is 1000 au for heliospheres where the interstellar bow shock is less than 500 au from the sun ) .",
    "the boundary parameters are the lism h@xmath13  and h@xmath31  number densities , and the ( common ) hydrogen velocity and temperature .      inferred values of the contemporary interstellar boundary parameters are @xmath61 km s@xmath1  and @xmath62 k @xcite .",

    "this model has been described in some detail previously by @xcite , whose figure 1 displays two - dimensional maps of plasma temperature and neutral density , featuring this model s heliospheric boundaries together with the neutral hydrogen wall . here , we do not repeat this figure , but rather display the plasma temperature ( top panel ) and density ( bottom panel ) along the stagnation axis as solid lines in figure [ fig-1d15 ] , together with the neutral h density ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the heliospheric boundaries are clearly visible as discontinuities in figure [ fig-1d15 ] , and labels are provided next to the temperature profile .",
    "the solar wind is supersonic at 1 au , and expands radially before undergoing a transition ( temperature and density increase ) at the termination shock ( ts ) .",
    "the ts is asymmetric , with a nose distance of 99 au and a tail distance of 216 au . in the heliosheath , the region of the shocked and heated solar wind",
    ", the solar wind plasma gets directed tailward , and is separated from the interstellar plasma by the heliopause ( hp ) , with discontinuous density and temperature . the stagnation point ( the nose of the heliopause ) is at 148 au .",
    "the lism is supersonic , and consequently there is an interstellar bow shock ( bs ) at 285 au upwind .",
    "the thermodynamically distinct plasma regions define the characteristics of the three neutral fluids used in the four - fluid model .",
    "the component 1 neutral population consists of neutrals from the ism .",
    "they typically are warm and of moderate bulk speed .",
    "neutrals born through charge exchange  in the hot heliosheath between the ts and the hp form a different neutral population ( component 2 ) which is hot , with correspondingly high thermal speeds .",
    "the third component consists of neutrals born inside the ts in the supersonic solar wind ; correspondingly , component 3 neutrals are fast and warm . while the approximation of the real neutral distribution function throughout the heliosphere by a superposition of three maxwellians ( the three neutral fluids ) introduces inaccuracies into the models , such a hydrodynamic treatment represents the overall neutral h distribution well , as evidenced for example by the successful matching of modeled and observed ly-@xmath8  absorption by heliospheric h@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig-1d15 ] also shows the temperature and density profile of a plasma - only model ( model 1 , dashed lines , ts at 90 au , hp at 300 au ) , which will be described in detail in the next section .",
    "the contrast between the two plasma temperature profiles is due to the effect of charge exchange : the pickup process ( here , the charge exchange  of a solar wind proton with an interstellar neutral h atom in the supersonic solar wind region ) deposits energy into the supersonic solar wind and reverses the effect of adiabatic cooling ( and also slows the solar wind ) , such that the effective solar wind temperature of model 5  turns upward , whereas model 1  follows an adiabatic cooling law . in both inner and outer heliosheath , heat transport by neutral hydrogen with subsequent secondary charge exchange  introduces gradual temperature gradients between the discontinuities , which are absent in model 1which has no neutrals , no charge exchange , and no anomalous heat transport across the hp .    in the contemporary heliosphere ( model 5 ) , there is a hydrogen wall between the bs and the hp , with a peak density of 0.502 @xmath20  = 2.3 @xmath29(h@xmath13 )  ( figure [ fig-1d15 ] bottom , dash dot line ) .",
    "the extra wall material consists of slower neutral hydrogen born from charge exchange  with the subsonic interstellar plasma downstream of the bs ( the outer heliosheath ) .",
    "the outer heliosheath plasma is interstellar plasma that is slowed and heated at the bs , and further affected by additional momentum loss and energy gain through charge exchange  of component 2 neutrals that cross from the inner into the outer heliosheath .",
    "the hydrogen wall is accompanied by an elevated plasma density ( figure [ fig-1d15 ] bottom , solid line ) because of the plasma slowdown .",
    "the neutral atom density at the upwind ts is 0.098 @xmath20  = 0.46 @xmath29(h@xmath13 ) , the latter ratio being called the filtration factor because it links the interstellar density to the neutral density in the inner heliosphere , accounting for the loss processes along its path .",
    "the neutral density at 5 au on the upwind stagnation axis is 0.036 @xmath20  = 0.17 @xmath29(h@xmath13 ) .",
    "closer to the sun , photoionization and solar wind charge exchange deplete neutral h exponentially . in the tail direction ,",
    "the stagnation axis re - populates slowly with off - axis neutral h.    models 410  of table [ tbl - para ] loosely fit within the constraints of contemporary observations , and generally represent ionization and density levels appropriate for low column density ism where both radiation field and abundances of cooling trace elements might vary .",
    "table [ tbl - res ] gives the corresponding results for all models , and it can be seen that the results from models 410  only vary modestly .",
    "the size of the heliosphere changes , with hp locations ranging from 100150 au , and neutral hydrogen filtration varies from 0.30.5 , while the relative peak wall density remains essentially unchanged .",
    "the interior of the local bubble void is hot and nearly completely ionized .",
    "the absence of interstellar neutral hydrogen in model 1  simplifies the heliospheric physics considerably , because in all other models the atom - ion process of charge exchange  generates distinct features in the atom distribution function , and also alters the plasma by coupling ions and atoms .",
    "we adopt the ism parameters of @xmath29(h@xmath31 )  = 0.005 @xmath20 , @xmath29(h@xmath13 )  = 0 , @xmath53 = 13.4 km s@xmath1 , and log t(k ) = 6.1 ( model 1  in table [ tbl - para ] ) , with the velocity based on the @xcite solar apex motion since the plasma is assumed at rest in the lsr .",
    "the speed of sound in such a plasma is 190 km s@xmath1 , and the sun therefore moves subsonically through this medium ( mach 0.07 ) . in this case",
    ", the isotropic thermal interstellar pressure dominates the ram pressure , and the termination shock is spherical at a distance of 90 au from the sun .",
    "this distance is comparable to that of the contemporary heliosphere .",
    "the distance to the nose of the heliopause is 300 au , which makes this sheath very large in comparison to the contemporary heliosphere above .",
    "the temperature in the sheath reaches values as high as @xmath63 k. figure [ fig-1d15 ] contains the plasma temperature profile ( top ) along the stagnation axis , and the plasma density ( bottom ) , as dashed lines . in the termination shock transition ,",
    "the density jumps by a factor of 3.8 , and the wind speed decreases to 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "in this model there are no neutral atoms in the entire system of solar wind and interstellar medium , and hence the particle content is different from that observed today .",
    "there are no pickup ions ( pui ) produced by charge exchange , and therefore there are no anomalous cosmic rays , and no slowdown or heating in the supersonic solar wind beyond the inner solar system .",
    "however , thanks to its large ram pressure the solar wind plasma still provides an effective shield of the solar system against the million - degree plasma of the local bubble .    as a plasma - only model with subsonic interstellar boundary conditions , model 1  is ideally suited for comparison to previous , analytical studies of the heliosphere under the assumption of incompressibility of the flow outside of the ts . for the simple case of a flow around a rigid sphere ( as a stand - in for the heliopause ) , the interstellar velocity on the stagnation axis behaves as @xmath64 @xmath65/@xmath66 ) , where @xmath67 is the distance to the hp nose , and @xmath64 the uncontaminated interstellar flow velocity .",
    "this analytical behavior matches the one of model 1  very well ( figure not shown here ) . in a detailed treatment , @xcite calculate the flow streamlines from a realistic , pressure - balanced ts outward .",
    "their ts distance formula ( equation ( [ eq - ts2 ] ) below ) predicts it to be at 81.8 au , which compares well with the 90 au found in model 1 , given that the latter ( numerical ) model does not presuppose incompressibility .",
    "it has to be noted that the models do not account for the interplanetary magnetic field , as doing so requires a three - dimensional treatment of the problem that is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "in particular for model 1  in which the mitigating aspects of the neutral - plasma interaction are absent , the pile - up of magnetic field at the nose of the hp ( axford - cranfill effect ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be a contributor to the overall pressure balance in the upwind directions of the inner heliosheath .",
    "the plasma would not decelerate as quickly as 1/@xmath68 downstream of the ts , as is approximately the case in model 1 .",
    "consequently , the heliopause would be expected to shift further away than the location identified in this paper .",
    "the unknown interstellar magnetic field strength in the local bubble has the potential to shift the pressure balance of the heliosphere as well .",
    "three models in table [ tbl - para ] represent the effect of an ism that is denser than that of the contemporary heliosphere by a factor of @xmath050 ( models 1517 ) , but not as dense as models investigated by @xcite with @xmath27 = 100 @xmath20 .",
    "additionally , models 14  and 27  are denser by a factor of 34 above the contemporary value .",
    "the high density leads to a high interstellar ram pressure , and therefore the resulting heliosphere tends to be smaller .    as an example , figure [ fig-2d20 ] displays 2-d maps of the hydrogen density and plasma temperature of model 17  ( @xmath29(h@xmath13)= 15 @xmath20 ) , and figure [ fig-1d1820 ] shows stagnation axis temperature , density , and velocity profiles ( dashed ) .",
    "the ts is asymmetric with a nose distance of 9.8 au and a tail distance of 23 au ( table [ tbl - res ] ) .",
    "the hp is located at 16 au , and the bs at 34 au upwind .",
    "the ts is weak , with an upwind compression ratio of 1.8 .",
    "atypically , the hp is not a sharp temperature gradient as in most other models , but the temperature profile is more washed out by frequent charge exchange .",
    "the bow shock has a moderate compression ratio of 3 .    in spite of the small heliosphere ,",
    "neutrals and protons are coupled tightly because of the high neutral density , so that the hydrogen wall starts immediately downstream of the bs .",
    "it has a peak density of 3.1 @xmath29(h@xmath13 ) , but charge exchange  is frequent enough that the neutral density at the ts ( the filtration factor ) is 0.12 @xmath29(h@xmath13 ) , which is among the lowest of the 27  models considered here .",
    "even so , the absolute neutral density is quite high , leading to a pronounced solar wind slowdown . on the upwind stagnation axis ,",
    "the solar wind speed decreases to 260 km s@xmath1  upstream of the ts . in the tail region",
    ", the solar wind plasma slows to 160 km s@xmath1 , but frequent charge exchange  decreases that value in the heliotail , to a common plasma / neutral speed of @xmath060 km s@xmath1  by @xmath0100 au downwind of the sun .",

    "if the corresponding cloud had a thickness comparable to the high velocity ism towards 23 ori ( @xmath330.12 pc ,  [ ss : globalism ] ) , it would pass over the sun in less than @xmath01400 yr .",

    "the 1-d stagnation axis profiles in temperature , density , and velocity are displayed in figure [ fig-1d1820 ] .    in most models ,",
    "the ts , taken as a 3-d surface , is spherical ( model 1 ) , or nearly spherical with an upwind / downwind asymmetry .",
    "these cases are characterized by a heliosheath and heliotail plasma that are subsonic throughout .",
    "in contrast to this , the shape of the ts of a high velocity ism heliosphere , such as model 25 , is qualitatively different , now resembling a rocket shape . the initially subsonic plasma at the nose of the heliosheath accelerates to supersonic speeds in the nozzle - shaped region between the ts and the hp .",
    "however , to match the subsonic heliotail plasma and the supersonic heliosheath plasma requires both a shock to decelerate the flow and a tangential discontinuity to adjust the density .",
    "a characteristic triple point occurs where heliosheath shock , termination shock , and the tangential discontinuity meet .",

    "the bow shock is quite strong , with a post shock plasma speed of 24 km s@xmath1  ( figure [ fig-1d1820 ] , bottom panel ) , temperature of @xmath59 k ( top ) , and a compression ratio of 3.4 ( middle ) . because of the large neutral velocity in the post - bow shock region , the neutral mean free path ( mfp ) for charge exchange is initially @xmath030 au , larger than the outer heliosheath , and shortens only gradually as the effective neutral velocity decreases to 31 km s@xmath1",
    "consequently , the model 25  hydrogen wall between the bs and the hp is not very thick , but reaches a peak density of 2.7 @xmath29(h@xmath13 )  about @xmath011 au downstream of the bs .",
    "this distance from the bs is of the same magnitude as in the more moderate cases , however , in the high speed case , it brings the peak close to the hp already .",
    "as the ts is so close to the hydrogen wall , the filtration factor is 1.0 , i.e.  the neutral density at the ts equals that of the lism ( and is still 0.6 @xmath29(h@xmath13 )  at 5 au , figure [ fig-1d1820 ] , middle panel ) .",
    "these filtration factors close to unity ( models 14 , 22   27  in table [ tbl - res ] ) seem only possible when a high interstellar velocity combines with a modest or low density so that the peak hydrogen wall occurs close to the hp without room for depletion of neutral h between peak and hp . in the similar sized dense heliosphere (  [ ss : hidens ] ) , the charge exchangemfps are shorter , the peak hydrogen wall is attained farther away from the hp , and charge exchange  upwind close to the hp spreads the h flow and leads to a density decrease already before the h@xmath13  flow crosses the hp ( figure [ fig-1d1820 ] ) .    finally , we note that for the high speed models 14  and 22 27 , the original numerical grid with a 5@xmath4  angular resolution is too coarse , leading to errors during the transport along directions with high velocity components . in these cases ,",
    "we choose a grid with a 2@xmath4  angular resolution , which cures the problem so that pre - bs density values on the stagnation axis are within 10% or better of the lism values .",
    "they are always more accurate in off - axis directions .",

    "model 1  stands out from the rest in that neutrals are absent . for the subsonic models 1  and 2",

    "all other models are ram - pressure dominated .",
    "this is among the reasons why the results discussed below cover only a subset of the vast parameter space .      when comparing the 27  models , an obvious result is the variation in the size of the heliosphere , as expressed in the location of upwind ts , hp , and bs in table [ tbl - res ] , as well as the distance of the downwind termination shock ( ts@xmath71 ) .",
    "these distances are set by balancing the solar wind pressure and interstellar pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a small heliosphere is caused by a large lism pressure .",
    "models 2 , 3 , 11  and 12  are especially large due to a lower lism plasma ram pressure , namely , a low lism velocity in the case of models 2 , 3  and 11 , and a low density for models 11  and 12 .",

    "the bow shock of a cool , slow , tenuous lism ( model 11 ) is as far as 810 au away from the sun .    because the overall system is pressure balanced ,",

    ", these fits are shown in figure [ fig - tscorr ] , with open circles representing their corresponding model data . both subsonic models 1  and 2  are outliers and were omitted .",
    "they obey a different asymmetry law than the rest of the models , stemming from the qualitatively different pressure distribution along the hp in the absence of a bow shock .",
    "model 11  is an outlier with an @xmath83 smaller by 63 au than predicted by the above relation . for small heliospheres , relation ( [ eq - tsd ] )",
    "fits the high density cases 15   17well , but underpredicts the asymmetry of models 14  and 27 , which due to their high velocity might be on their way to the rocket - shaped cases .",
    "the mentioned outliers are not included in the factors of equations ( [ eq - tsd ] ) and ( [ eq - tsdr ] ) .",
    "the pressure distribution in the rocket - shaped cases goes hand - in - hand with a more inward location of the bow shock ; the models where the bs location is inconsistent with eq.([eq - bshp ] ) are the ones where the heliosphere is of that shape .    in the supersonic solar wind , the total pressure is dominated by the plasma ram pressure .",
    "since most of the kinetic energy of the solar wind is converted into heat at the termination shock , it is effectively the upstream solar wind ram pressure that balances the total interstellar pressure @xmath84 , the sum of plasma thermal and ram pressure and neutral h thermal and ram pressure .",
    "hence a simple 1-d pressure balance would be achieved , assuming constant solar wind velocity @xmath85 and an @xmath86 dependence of the density for the supersonic solar wind region , at the radial distance of @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the solar wind ram pressure , and @xmath89 the solar wind density , both taken at @xmath90 = 1 au .",

    "however , the validity of ( [ eq - ts1 ] ) and ( [ eq - ts2 ] ) can be extended to the supersonic lism case , because an interstellar bow shock will convert the flow to subsonic speeds .",

    "one ( @xmath98 ) is obtained by using solely the lism plasma pressure in equations ( [ eq - pb ] , [ eq - ts2 ] ) ( @xmath99 ) , effectively neglecting neutral h altogether .",

    "the plasma - only correlation ( [ eq - ts2pcorr ] , diamonds ) is poor , and especially pairing models 3  with 11 , and 26  with 27 , shows that the same plasma total pressure does lead to different heliospheres depending on the neutral contribution .",
    "in addition , the high density cases 1517  are complete outliers ( as are 26  and 27 ) where the plasma pressure alone overpredicts the heliospheric size . for the correlation ( [ eq - ts2corr ] ) ( squares ) ,",
    "it is not necessary to exclude any of the supersonic heliospheres , in particular not models 1517 .",
    "only model 2  is an outlier , but not model 1 .    the predicted and modeled ts distances in the plasma - only relation ( [ eq - ts2pcorr ] )",
    "scatter around the fit too much , and neutral dominated models are excluded outright .",
    "the deviations from the predicted locations indicate changes to the pressure balance due to charge exchange  with neutral h. the pressure balance gets shifted inwards by pickup ion production in the supersonic solar wind that reduces the supersonic wind speed and hence its ram pressure . on the other hand ,",
    "the ts pressure balance can get shifted outwards by other effects , among them the deceleration of the outer heliosheath plasma by charge exchange  with secondary neutrals .",
    "relation ( [ eq - ts2corr ] ) has a much smaller scatter and therefore is better suited to predict @xmath72 , with the caveat that the neutral - plasma interaction drives the neutrals out of equilibrium , and pressure balance can only be described by an empirical factor of 1.35",
    ".    this study is focusing solely on the variation of interstellar boundary parameters and the heliospheric response . while we do not wish to study the question of different solar wind conditions on the heliosphere here , it is interesting to note that all the results so far only depend on @xmath103 , the solar wind ram pressure at 1 au , and that the locations of ts , hp , and bs are dictated by a pressure balance between solar wind and lism , with empirical correction factors . in reality , the solar wind is time dependent on an 11 year cycle and on smaller , episodic timescales .",
    "the variation in solar wind ram pressure leads to small variations in the heliospheric boundary locations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are qualitatively consistent with eq.([eq - ts2corr ] ) . similarly , the increased ram pressure in polar directions from the fast polar wind during solar minimum results in larger heliospheric distances in these directions as compared to isotropic slow solar wind @xcite .",
    "an example of the reaction of the heliosphere to different solar wind ram pressures while holding the ism environment constant is the comparison of models 2224  in table [ tbl - res ] , where the boundaries move outward for a ram pressure increase ( model 24 ) , but do not change for a doubling of the solar wind thermal pressure ( model 23 ) .",
    "recent investigations of astrospheres around other cool main - sequence stars @xcite use a range of stellar wind ram pressures @xmath103 that are different from the solar wind , but a modeling strategy identical to the one for the heliosphere .",
    "a cursory analysis of these models ( plots not shown here ) shows that equations ( 1 ) - ( [ eq - ts2corr ] ) hold also for all these cases within the stated accuracy .",
    "this result underscores the argument of pressure balance , and extends the results of this section to other ram pressure regimes such as for astrospheres carved out of the ism by coronal stellar winds .",
    "the density @xmath104 of neutral hydrogen that crosses the termination shock at the upwind stagnation axis varies over a considerable range in the 27  models , from 0.01 to 0.33 @xmath20 , with four larger values between 0.9 and 2 @xmath20  for the high density models 1517  and 27 .",
    "the filtration ratio @xmath105 is the neutral density at the ts divided by the interstellar neutral density @xmath29(h@xmath13 ) , well upstream of the bs ( to avoid contamination by component 2 and 3 neutrals ) , and these relative values vary from 0.1 to 0.6 , with a few higher values 0.71.0 for higher velocities .",
    "the filtration is listed as @xmath106 in table [ tbl - res ] for all 27  models , as are similar ratios for the peak hydrogen wall density ( @xmath107 ) and for the density at 5 au on the upwind stagnation axis ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we choose 5 au as a fixed reference distance with the expectation that photoionization is not yet important at this distance .    the neutral hydrogen at the ts is comprised of original interstellar material , and of slower secondary neutrals created upwind of the hp which form the hydrogen wall .",
    "after crossing the hp these neutrals get depleted in the heliosheath by charge exchange  which replaces them with neutrals mostly in outward directions",
    ". for high velocity models , this loss process starts from a higher hp density so that higher filtration ratios occur (  [ ss : hivel ] ) .",

    "the correlations are , @xmath110^{0.72\\pm 0.04}\\label{eq - ftsfive}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all models have been included in ( [ eq - ntsfive ] ) , and the high density models 1517  had to be excluded as outliers in ( [ eq - ftsfive ] ) ( plot not shown ) .",
    "the data and the fit ( [ eq - ntsfive ] ) are displayed in figure [ fig - neutcorr ] by circle symbols .",
    "this correlation is interesting in that it relates a density at a fixed distance to a density at the ts regardless of the actual distance of the ts .",
    "the net loss in the region of the supersonic solar wind is not sensitive to the length of the neutral particle trajectories between the ts and 5 au because most of the charge exchange  relevant to the 5 au density takes place immediately upwind of that distance , given that the local plasma density is larger with smaller distance , resulting in smaller charge exchangemean free path lengths .",
    "the peak densities in the hydrogen wall range from 1.1 @xmath29(h@xmath13 )  to massive hydrogen walls of 7 @xmath29(h@xmath13 ) , corresponding 0.09105 @xmath20  in absolute units .",
    "the absolute peak density is weakly correlated to the 5 au value , as demonstrated by the diamond symbols in figure [ fig - neutcorr ] . even on a log - log plot , however , a large scatter of the results around possible power laws is evident . according to a regression analysis that omits the high density models 1517",
    ", @xmath111 nonetheless , the fit is poor .",
    "the same problem is encountered when relating the neutral results to the interstellar velocity .",
    "there is a general trend of higher neutral densities with higher velocity .",
    "figure [ fig - neutvcorr ] shows the filtration results ( circles ) and the relative densities at 5 au ( diamonds ) plotted against the interstellar velocity .",
    "it is evident that any correlation derived from these model results is not unique , as there are many data points around @xmath112 km s@xmath1  whose normalized neutral results vary by a factor of 2.7 . the fit lines shown in figure [ fig - neutvcorr ] are @xmath113 @xmath53/(@xmath114 km s@xmath1 ) and @xmath115/(@xmath116 km s@xmath1 ) .    by way of a cautionary note",
    ", it should be noted that the above relations are likely model dependent , in that using another self - consistent modeling strategy for the heliosphere , such as a particle kinetic model for the neutral h @xcite , might result in different coefficients for the relations ( [ eq - hpts])([eq - tsdr ] ) , and ( [ eq - ts2pcorr])([eq - fivepeakcorr ] ) . short of carrying out a parameter study with these alternate models and comparing the results , it is impossible to incorporate this systematic error into the error estimates of the coefficients given in the above relations .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss some of the consequences that different interstellar environments have for the solar system and for earth .",
    "there are several models listed in table [ tbl - res ] representing heliospheres that are so small that the outer planets find themselves beyond the supersonic region of the solar wind , at least for parts of their orbits . as examples , figures",
    "[ fig-2d20 ] and [ fig-2dcyg ] have the orbits for the gas giants saturn , uranus , and neptune marked in them .",
    "an assumption in these plots is that the ism flow vector is close to the plane of the ecliptic , as is the case in the current environment . for larger angles ,",
    "the ecliptic ts distances are farther due to the upwind / downwind asymmetry of the heliosphere .    in the high density case 17  ( figure [ fig-2d20 ] )",
    ", uranus periodically crosses the ts , traverses the hot inner heliosheath , crosses the hp , and spends part of its orbit in the shocked lism ( the outer heliosheath ) , before crossing the hp again in a reverse course of events .",
    "neptune is always surrounded by hot , shocked plasma ( either the solar wind heliosheath and heliotail or the interstellar plasma of the outer heliosheath ) , and is never upstream of the ts .",
    "similarly , in the high velocity case of model 25  ( figure [ fig-2dcyg ] ) , part of neptune s orbit is in the subsonic solar wind of the heliosheath , and uranus periodically comes close to the ts .    for planets in the hot inner heliosheath it can be expected that solar wind injection into planetary magnetospheres is more efficient due to increased thermal plasma velocity and solar wind turbulence . also the solar wind magnetic field strength is enhanced , and an increased flux in both galactic cosmic rays and heliospheric energetic particles is to be expected .",
    "planets that cross into the outer heliosheath will be exposed to not quite as hot a plasma , carrying a basically undetermined magnetic field .",
    "however , the planet will then be exposed to the increased neutral density of the hydrogen wall .",
    "this neutral flow will strike the planetary atmosphere unimpeded and lead to atmospheric drag and other effects @xcite .",
    "none of the 27  models considered here leads to such dire predictions for earth s orbit , and extrapolating from equations ( [ eq - ts2 ] ) and ( [ eq - ts2corr ] ) beyond their validity , interstellar densities of 1500 @xmath20  with moderate interstellar velocities , or a velocity of 345 km s@xmath1  with moderate interstellar densities , would be needed to place the ts at 1 au .",
    "it should be expected that both these numbers are only a qualitative estimate , and that detailed modeling of such heliospheres would have to take into account additional physical processes @xcite .",
    "as many models in this paper have an inner boundary at or beyond 1 au , we want to focus on the reference distance of 5 au instead to assess the change in particle environment that occurs with different galactic environments under the assumption of an unchanging solar wind . at this distance ,",
    "the solar wind is supersonic for all 27  models .",
    "the ratio of interstellar ( slow ) neutral hydrogen to solar wind protons at 5 au upwind is between 7% and 25% for the contemporary heliosphere ( models 410 ) . as already mentioned in ",
    "[ ss : neutralcorr ] , this density ratio scales with interstellar velocity , ranging from from 2% to 37% ( models 2  and 18 - 24 , respectively ; model 14 : 120% , model 25 : 45% ) , and is highest for the high density models 1417  and 27 . in particular",
    ", there is more than seven times more neutral h than solar wind protons at 5 au in models 16  and 17",
    ".    naturally , the increased presence of interstellar h@xmath13  increases the rate of charge exchange  and hence the production rate of fast component 3 neutrals , the so - called neutral solar wind ( nsw ) .",
    "the nsw density at 5 au for the contemporary heliospheres is @xmath1174 @xmath118 @xmath20 , but increases to 0.014 , 0.018 , and 0.023 @xmath20  for models 15 , 16 , and 17 , respectively",
    ". a similar drastic relative nsw increase should occur at earth orbit as well for these high density cases .",
    "in contrast , the high velocity case 25  only yields a five - fold increase of nsw to 0.002 @xmath20  at 5 au .      as an application of the results discussed above we make use of a cosmic ray transport model for three demonstrative solutions of gcr phase space density .",
    "they are calculated for the interstellar environments corresponding to the local bubble , the lic , and a dense cloud of mostly neutral hydrogen , based approximately on models 1 , 9 , and 15 , respectively .",
    "the cosmic - ray transport model we use is discussed in detail in @xcite and the reader is referred to that paper for a complete description .",
    "briefly , the plasma flow background obtained from the multi - fluid code is used to calculate all 3 components of the heliospheric magnetic field in the azimuthal plane from faraday s law combined with the zero divergence condition with a parker spiral field specified at the inner boundary @xcite .",
    "the modified field component of @xcite that alters the transport parameters at high heliographic latitude is also included in the model .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field plays no role in this model because it fluctuates on scales that are typically much larger than diameter of the cosmic ray gyroorbit and hence has little effect on the particle s trajectories .",
    "next , magnetic turbulent energy @xmath119 and the associated turbulence correlation length in the solar wind region are computed from the hydrodynamic model of incompressible turbulence transport @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the number of waves propagating parallel and antiparallel to the mean magnetic field are equal and ignores certain wave propagation effects by neglecting the alfvn speed compared with the mean plasma velocity in the solar wind .",
    "little is known observationally about the turbulent content of the inner heliosheath , and turbulence transport in that region is poorly understood at present .",
    "here we use a simple assumption that the turbulent ratio @xmath120 and the correlation length are both constant across the termination shock and in the heliosheath .",
    "this assumption is based on the physics of alfvn wave transmission through a quasi - perpendicular shock that yields the expression relating the turbulent ratio on the two sides of the shock as @xcite @xmath121 which is not too different from 1 for shocks of moderate strength ( compression ratios @xmath122 2.53.0 ) .",
    "the turbulent content of the solar wind is strongly influenced by the process of alfvn wave generation by pickup ions as they scatter from the initial ring - beam distribution onto a bisphere in velocity space @xcite . because pickup ions are produced in charge transfer collisions between solar wind protons and interstellar hydrogen atoms , changes in neutral density are the principal source of turbulence variability .",
    "the latter translates into variations in the amount of gcr modulation through an appropriate diffusion model .",
    "we use the quasi - linear theory ( qlt ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the parallel component of the diffusion tensor and the nonlinear guiding center ( nlgc ) theory @xcite for the perpendicular component .",
    "the former is governed by the fluctuations with wavevectors oriented parallel to the mean magnetic field ( the slab component ) , while the latter is determined by the fluctuations orthogonal to the field ( the 2d component ) .",
    "we assume that slab fluctuations comprise 10% of the total energy with 2d making up the rest , which is in agreement with the observed ratio @xcite .",
    "both qlt and nlgc require a specification of the reduced ( one - dimensional ) turbulent spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum measured in the solar wind at low latitudes consists of a flat energy range followed by a kolmogorov inertial range with @xmath123 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while some observational evidence points to a @xmath124 dependence at high latitudes @xcite .",
    "the low end of the turbulence spectrum is likely to be populated by structures ( shocks and discontinuities ) that may be responsible for the modulation of very high energy ( above 1 gev ) particles .",
    "accordingly , we use two forms of the power spectrum , identical in the inertial range , but having a different spectral index in the energy range : 0 ( diffusion model i ) and @xmath125 ( diffusion model ii ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the first model emphasizes modulation in the heliosheath region , while model ii is dominated by solar wind modulation .",
    "because the amount of modulation in the heliosheath is not known at present we use two plausible models to cover the full range of possibilities .",
    "the different sizes of the heliosphere as well as the different particle distributions will affect the modulation of gcrs as they pass from the ism through the heliosphere into interplanetary space and to earth .",
    "the gcr transport coefficients depend on the heliospheric magnetic field as well as on the level of plasma turbulence .",
    "while the magnetic field geometry , its strength , and the properties of solar wind turbulence ( especially in the heliosheath ) are far from having been studied conclusively , theoretical models of cosmic - ray transport can be constructed on the basis of known physics @xcite . here",
    "we perform a series of computer simulations of gcr modulation in the global heliosphere for models 1  ( heliosphere in the local bubble ) , 9  ( contemporary heliosphere ) , and 15  ( a high density cloud encounter ) .",
    "a thicker heliosheath such as in model 1  could , in principle , be expected to yield stronger modulation of gcrs ( i.e.a lower particle flux arriving at earth ) . however , the level of magnetic field turbulence production , which in turn depends partly on pui production , can be less efficient in low density environments .",
    "figure [ fig - gcr ] shows the high energy proton gcr spectra for the three cases ( models 1 , 9 , and 15 ) calculated with diffusion models i and ii .",
    "the right panel of this figure shows particle intensity at the termination shock thus demonstrating the effect of heliosheath modulation . because low energy gcr protons typically do not reach 1 au , we focus on the high energy end of the spectra .",
    "it follows from our model calculations that the gcr environment at earth for the local bubble scenario ( model 1 ) would have been less intense than at present if diffusion model i was correct , or , surprisingly , more intense with model ii diffusion coefficients .",
    "the latter is a consequence of the large gcr mean free path predicted by the second diffusion model for the solar wind region in model 1  in the absence of pui turbulence driving . in both cases the cumulative heliosheath gcr modulation is more important for the local bubble environment than for the contemporary heliosphere",
    "this is a combined effect of a stronger ts , a larger decrease in the radial mean free path across the shock , and a thicker heliosheath .    for an encounter with a high density cloud ( model 15 ) ,",
    "the heliospheric gcr shielding is much less effective than in the contemporary heliosphere , such that the high energy part of the gcr spectrum approaches the one assumed for the pristine lism . here",
    ", the opposing effects of a relatively large heliosheath diffusion coefficient combined with a much smaller extent of the modulation cavity , and enhanced pui turbulence driving in the solar wind result in a significant reduction in the heliospheric shielding of gcrs .",
    "the predicted cosmic - ray intensity increase at earth is between 1.42.4 ( model i ) and 4.17.6 ( model ii ) in the energy interval between 300 mev and 1 gev .",
    "in addition to gcrs , the distribution of anomalous cosmic rays which are accelerated at the ts , will depend on the background neutral density , and the strength and distance of the ts @xcite .",
    "together , the cosmic ray environment at earth influences the terrestrial magnetosphere as well as climate , atmosphere , and biology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on its path through the galaxy , the sun has encountered ( and will encounter ) different interstellar environments .",
    "this motivates a parameter study to investigate the response of the heliosphere to these changing conditions under the assumption of a constant solar wind . for conditions that are not too far from the contemporary lism environment ,",
    "the following findings emerge from analyzing 27  self - consistent multi - fluid models .    1 .",
    "allowing generous assumptions about the lic morphology , the lic column density towards nearby stars indicates the sun first encountered the lic gas within the past 40,000 yr , and the clic within the past @xmath060,000/@xmath22 yr ( where @xmath22 represents the fraction of space filled by the clic ) .",
    "the sun is expected to exit the lism gas cloudlet , which is characterized by the common lic velocity , sometime within the next @xmath004000 yr . in general , passage through interstellar clouds will lead to variations in the heliosphere boundary conditions over timescales possibly as short as 10@xmath126 yr .",
    "nearby ism generally resembles low column density ism observed elsewhere .",
    "the size of the heliosphere is determined by the balance of solar wind and interstellar pressure . for the investigated parameter range ,",
    "in which the lism is mostly ram - pressure dominated , the upwind termination shock distance can be estimated by equation ( [ eq - ts2corr ] ) , using equations ( [ eq - pb ] ) and ( [ eq - ts2 ] ) .",
    "this relation is derived from a pressure balance argument modified by an empirical factor expressing the efficiency of the neutral pressure contribution to the overall interstellar pressure .",
    "heliocentric distances of interest such as the heliopause , the bow shock , or the upwind and downwind termination shock scale linearly with each other ( e.g.  @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) .",
    "therefore , when the upwind termination shock distance is predicted in an absolute way as above , the other distances can be predicted as well .",
    "however , the scalability and predictability of the heliosphere size with these relations are only applicable to parameter sets in which the lism flow is supersonic .",
    "the subsonic cases , when the sun is surrounded by hot plasma or alternately when the sun and the surrounding interstellar cloud are comoving in space , obey a different set of correlations , and are generally more difficult to model numerically .",
    "4 .   for low interstellar velocities , the heliosheath and heliotail plasma are subsonic throughout , and the ratio of downwind to upwind termination shock distance ( ts asymmetry ) is 2.1 . for higher velocities , the heliosphere assumes a rocket shape , with a modified pressure balance in the downwind directions .",
    "neutral hydrogen results such as the filtration ratio , the peak hydrogen wall density , or the density at 5 au upwind of the sun , correlate with each other .",
    "their absolute value is weakly correlated to the interstellar velocity with which the neutrals arrive at the respective heliosphere , as the charge exchange mean free path depends on this velocity , and higher velocities shorten the heliocentric distances to the heliospheric boundaries .",
    "6 .   for encounters with a high density interstellar cloud ( @xmath015 @xmath20 , about 50 times the contemporary value ) , the particle fluxes arriving at earth orbit , including interstellar neutrals , neutral solar wind , and cosmic rays will increase markedly .",
    "these changes potentially affect earth s atmosphere and its climate .",
    "the changes in particle fluxes just due to a higher interstellar velocity are less pronounced",
    "for the period when the sun was embedded in the local bubble , particle fluxes were reduced substantially .",
    "secondary particles like anomalous cosmic rays and neutral solar wind were entirely absent , and the galactic cosmic ray flux arriving at earth was comparable to the contemporary flux , or even reduced , depending on the modulation model .    this material is based upon work supported by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) under grants issued through the science mission directorate , namely through the astrophysics theory program under grant nag5 - 13611 , and through the solar and heliospheric physics grant nag5 - 12879 .",
