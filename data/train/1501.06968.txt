    "one of the most important characterizations of an oscillating system is its frequency . in fluid dynamics ,",
    "perhaps the best known example of a oscillating system is the von krmn vortex street generated in the wake of a circular cylinder . because this oscillating flow arises from a supercritical hopf bifurcation",
    ", the frequencies observed in experiments  @xcite and in direct numerical simulations  @xcite agree at onset with the hopf frequency obtained from a linear stability analysis of the steady flow  @xcite .",
    "however , as the oscillations grow in amplitude away from the bifurcation , their frequencies differ substantially from those obtained from linear stability analysis , and as a result , even quite close to onset , standard stability analysis of steady base flows dramatically fails to predict observed oscillation frequencies .",
    "this has led to a growing interest in obtaining frequencies of oscillating systems , the cylinder wake in particular , by analysing their temporally - averaged profiles , rather than steady base flows .",
    "hammond and redekopp @xcite , pier @xcite , barkley @xcite , and mittal @xcite have shown that a linear stability analysis about the mean velocity profile yields an eigenvalue whose imaginary part corresponds very closely to the nonlinear frequency .",
    "in addition , the real part of the eigenvalue is virtually zero , which barkley @xcite interpreted as the marginal stability of the mean flow .",
    "this property , which we shall call the real - zero imaginary - frequency , or rzif property , will be of central interest in the following .",
    "the importance of the mean field and of its marginal stability was the subject of classic articles by malkus @xcite and by stuart @xcite .",
    "wesfreid and co - workers have measured the the mean flow in configurations such as the wake of a triangular obstacle @xcite and a confined jet @xcite .",
    "noack @xcite have formulated a hierarchy of low - dimensional models for the cylinder wake which incorporate both the mean flow and the nonlinear limit cycle .",
    "rzif was further studied by sipp and lebedev @xcite by means of a weakly nonlinear expansion about the hopf bifurcation point , in which the successive two - dimensional solvability conditions and eigenproblems generated at each order were solved numerically .",
    "they demonstrated the non - universality of rzif by carrying out the procedure for both the cylinder wake and the oscillatory flow over a square cavity and showing that , close to onset , the cylinder - wake mean flow had the rzif property while the cavity mean flow did not .",
    "mantic - lugo _",
    "et al_.  @xcite showed that the assumption of rzif could be used to calculate an accurate approximation to the mean flow without the need to compute the nonlinear limit cycle .",
    "more specifically , they calculated a flow such that linearization about it led to an eigenvalue with zero real part , and showed that this flow was extremely close to the actual mean flow of the limit cycle . until now",
    ", rzif has been investigated only for open flows and almost exclusively the cylinder wake . here",
    ", we carry out a similar investigation of the traveling and standing waves which emerge simultaneously from a hopf bifurcation in thermosolutal convection .",
    "we find that the traveling waves are an ideal case of rzif ; the standing waves , however , do not display this phenomenon at all .    finally , and most significantly , we then show that rzif is closely connected to the temporal spectrum of the nonlinear oscillations . if the temporal dependence is monochromatic , i.e. if the oscillations are trigonometric , then rzif is exactly satisfied .",
    "if the spectrum decays rapidly away from the main frequency , as is the case for the thermosolutal traveling waves but not the standing waves , then rzif is approximately satisfied .",
    "thermosolutal convection is driven by independently imposed gradients in the temperature and concentration of the fluid .",
    "more specifically , temperatures and concentrations are set to values which differ by @xmath0 and @xmath1 at two plates separated by a vertical distance @xmath2 . under the boussinesq approximation ,",
    "the density @xmath3 in the buoyancy term is assumed to depend linearly on temperature and concentration , with coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; the kinematic viscosity @xmath6 and thermal and solute diffusivities @xmath7 and @xmath8 are assumed to be constant .",
    "we nondimensionalize lengths , temperature , concentration and time by @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the thermal viscous time @xmath9 .",
    "one solution to the equations of motion is the conductive state , in which the fluid is motionless and the thermal and solutal profiles vary linearly with height ; we denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 the deviations of temperature and concentration from the conductive state . restricting ourselves to the two - dimensional case",

    "for tw , @xmath59 is independent of time and for sw , @xmath59 is evaluated at the moment at which the integral of the temperature is maximal .",
    "the abrupt onset of the tw branch reflects the fact that the hopf bifurcation to traveling waves in thermosolutal convection with free - slip boundary conditions is degenerate @xcite , so that @xmath61 rather than the usual square - root dependence .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of the amplitude of the sw branch may indicate a secondary transition , which will not concern us in this investigation .",
    "the traveling waves are invariant under the combined boussinesq - shift symmetry : @xmath62 the tw are also invariant under the family of spatio - temporal symmetries @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the velocity .",

    "we now linearize the governing equations about @xmath78 : @xmath81 this procedure is not a conventional linear stability analysis since @xmath78 is not a steady solution unless @xmath82 . for clarity ,",
    "when @xmath78 is the mean field of nonlinear sw or tw states , the operator @xmath83 will be denoted by @xmath84 or @xmath85 and its leading eigenvalues will be denoted by @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "these eigenmodes are the main focus of the following sections .",
    "figure [ fig : twfields](a ) shows snapshots of a traveling wave @xmath88 .",
    "we show deviations @xmath89 and @xmath11 from the conductive temperature and concentration profiles and the streamfunction @xmath12 of the velocity field .",
    "equation shows that @xmath90 is the appropriate quantity to compare with @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : twfields](b ) shows the mean field @xmath91 , of this traveling wave . for traveling waves",
    ", this temporal average can be obtained by an instantaneous spatial average : @xmath92 and thus is necessarily independent of @xmath51 .",
    "the mean fields are entirely different from the cellular instantaneous fields : the instantaneous fields are dominated by periodic dependence in @xmath51 which vanishes upon integration and a much smaller @xmath51-independent component .    if @xmath93 were of the same trigonometric form as the eigenvectors , its spatial and temporal average would necessarily be zero .",
    "nonlinear effects are responsible for modifying the spatial dependence of the traveling waves and creating the mean field . the form of the mean fields can be explained heuristically by the lowest order nonlinearity , namely substituting the spatial form of the eigenvectors into the nonlinear term : @xmath94 & =   { \\mathcal{j}}[\\psi_0 \\cos(kx ) \\sin(\\pi",
    "z),{\\theta}_0 \\sin(kx)\\sin(\\pi z ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = k\\pi\\psi_0{\\theta}_0 \\sin(2\\pi z)/2 \\label{eq : sin2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "since in , the streamfunction is an eigenfunction of the laplacian , the lowest order nonlinear contribution to the streamfunction equation vanishes : @xmath96 = { \\mathcal{j}}[\\psi ,- q^2\\psi ] = 0 \\label{eq : psijpsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indeed , the mean fields shown in figure [ fig : twfields](b ) have a functional form like and the amplitude of the mean streamfunction is very small : @xmath97 , compared to @xmath98 , again motivating our use of the term mean field , rather than mean flow .",
    "the observations and are those which lead to the formulation of the three - variable lorenz model for convection @xcite and the five - variable veronis model for thermosolutal convection @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : twfields](c ) constitutes one of our main findings , namely that linearization about the mean field of the tws yields an eigenvalue whose imaginary part matches the frequency of the nonlinear traveling waves and whose real part is close to zero .",
    "that is , the traveling waves in thermosolutal convection have the rzif property , which is manifested in the figure by the fact that the long - dashed red and solid black curves coincide .",
    "the real and imaginary parts , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , of the leading eigenvalues of @xmath84 are shown .",
    "the frequency @xmath100 agrees almost exactly with the actual frequency @xmath101 of the nonlinear traveling waves over the entire range of our study , @xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , the growth rate @xmath99 of this eigenvalue remains approximately zero up to at least 50@xmath103 above onset .",
    "this implies that the mean fields , viewed as solutions of the governing equations for thermosolutal convection - with the appropriate reynolds stress forcing - are marginally stable .",
    "figure [ fig : twfields](c ) also shows @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the real and imaginary parts of the leading eigenvalue of @xmath24 . since the onset of traveling waves corresponds to a supercritical hopf bifurcation of the conductive state , @xmath104 crosses zero and the non - zero frequency @xmath105 necessarily agrees with the nonlinear frequency at onset .",
    "however , past the bifurcation , the frequencies diverge from one other and @xmath105 drastically overpredicts the observed value @xmath101 .",
    "this is very much like the situation for the cylinder wake  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : twfields](d)-(f ) illustrates the relationship between the traveling wave @xmath106 , its mean field @xmath107 , and the conductive state .",
    "the time series , figure [ fig : twfields](d ) , shows the temperature at a representative point .",
    "the field at @xmath108 is a small - amplitude trigonometric profile .",
    "this initial small perturbation of the conductive state grows in time and saturates as the stable traveling wave state .",
    "the frequency is initially @xmath105 , but decreases as the amplitude grows , demonstrating the over - prediction of @xmath105 relative to @xmath101 .",
    "the phase portraits resemble analogous ones by barkley  @xcite and by noack  @xcite for the cylinder wake .",
    "figure [ fig : twfields](e ) plots @xmath89 at two points on the midline separated by @xmath109 .",
    "the trajectory spirals out to the final saturated limit cycle .",
    "a second phase portrait in figure [ fig : twfields](f ) has as its vertical axis @xmath110 \\label{eq : meanproxy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which approximates a projection onto the mean field .",
    "this phase portrait shows clearly that the traveling wave does not orbit around the conductive state , which is at the bottom of the figure , but instead around the mean field @xmath78 , whose projection onto this phase plane is located at the top .",
    "we now consider the standing waves that arises simultaneously with the traveling waves at the hopf bifurcation and seen in figure [ fig : bifdiag ] .",
    "although they are unstable , standing waves can be calculated by direct simulation by imposing reflection symmetry in @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ fig : swfields](a ) shows instantaneous fields over one oscillation of a standing wave . the mean field @xmath111 is shown in figure [ fig : swfields](b ) . as was the case for the traveling wave ,",
    "the mean field bears little resemblance to the instantaneous standing waves .",
    "however , contrary to those of the traveling wave , all of the sw mean fields vary in @xmath51 .",
    "the primary horizontal wavenumber seen in figure [ fig : swfields](a ) is @xmath112 , while those seen in figure [ fig : swfields](b ) are 0 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 and 0 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "although the mean streamfunction is not as small as in the tw case , we have @xmath117 compared to @xmath118 .",
    "the frequency @xmath119 of the standing waves and the leading eigenvalues of @xmath85 are shown in figure [ fig : swfields](c ) .",
    "these behave quite differently from their traveling wave counterparts in figure [ fig : twfields](c ) . here",
    ", @xmath119 increases with @xmath57 near onset and remains quite close to the frequency @xmath105 of the conductive state up to @xmath120 , while , in contrast , the frequency @xmath121 decreases immediately after onset .",
    "however , for @xmath122 , @xmath119 begins to diverge from @xmath105 , veering down quite sharply starting at @xmath123 and then less abruptly at @xmath124 , mirroring the behavior of @xmath121 .",
    "the distance between @xmath119 and @xmath121 remains finite and approximately constant as the two move in tandem .",
    "in contrast @xmath105 continues to increase , thus diverging from @xmath119 .",
    "thus , although @xmath105 is a much better predictor of @xmath119 for @xmath125 , the downward trend of @xmath119 for @xmath126 .",
    "is tracked quite accurately by @xmath121 .",
    "in contrast to the traveling - wave case , the growth rate @xmath127 is positive and grows linearly along with that of the conductive state ; @xmath128 is not a marginally stable state . for @xmath122 , @xmath104 continues to increase linearly , while @xmath121 increases more steeply for @xmath129 and then tapers off for @xmath130 .",
    "thus , the approach of @xmath121 towards @xmath119 for @xmath122 is not matched by an approach of @xmath127 towards zero . in summary , the standing waves in thermosolutal convection",
    "do not have the rzif property , as manifested in the figure by the fact that the long - dashed red and solid black lines are far from one another .",
    "the real part of the mean - field eigenvalue is far from zero and the frequency does not match the observed nonlinear frequency .",
    "figure [ fig : swfields](d)-(f ) illustrates the dynamics of the approach to the standing wave , via a timeseries and two phase portraits .",
    "figure [ fig : swfields](d ) , a timeseries of the mean - field projection proxy , shows a brief oscillation about the conductive state followed by saturated oscillations about the mean field . the phase portrait in fig .",
    "[ fig : swfields](e ) shows the instantaneous temperature and concentration at the domain midpoint ; in this projection , the standing wave traces out a trapezoid , oriented along the positive diagonal , corresponding to the @xmath131 temporal phase shift between the two fields .",
    "the phase portrait in fig .  [ fig : swfields](f ) demonstrates the difference between the standing and traveling wave dynamics : the projection onto the mean field is far from constant .",
    "an important second harmonic component is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : swfields](f ) , since a maximum in corresponds alternately to a minimum and a maximum in @xmath132 .",
    "we now present a simple but general analysis giving conditions under which the rzif property is guaranteed .",
    "consider any evolution equation @xmath133 where @xmath24 is linear and @xmath134 is a quadratic nonlinearity .",
    "let @xmath135 ( with @xmath136 ) be the temporal fourier decomposition of a periodic solution to with mean @xmath78 and frequency @xmath137 .",
    "substituting into leads to @xmath138 separating by frequency leads to an equation for the zero frequency terms : @xmath139 which is the same as eq .",
    "satisfied by the mean field , and equations for the nonzero frequency terms ( @xmath140 ) : @xmath141 the first three terms on the right - hand - side of this expression are just those defining the linearization about @xmath78 .",
    "hence , for @xmath140 we have @xmath142 where @xmath143 .",
    "for example :    @xmath144    [ eq : n ]    if @xmath145 , i.e.  if the periodic cycle is exactly monochromatic , then @xmath146 and @xmath147 i.e. @xmath83 has an eigenvalue whose real part is zero and whose imaginary part is the frequency of the periodic solution .",
    "hence the rzif property necessarily follows for monochromatic oscillations in a system with quadratic nonlinearity .",
    "more generally if , as is often the case , @xmath148 then @xmath149 so that holds approximately .",
    "the validity of or does not require that @xmath150 be negligible in for higher harmonics @xmath151 and indeed it is not .",
    "assuming the scaling , equations show that for @xmath152 , @xmath150 is of the same order as the other terms in , e.g. @xmath153    , i.e. @xmath154 for multiples @xmath155 of the observed frequency .",

    "quadratic interaction of @xmath158 with itself takes two forms : @xmath159 leads the mean flow @xmath78 to differ from the base flow , while @xmath160 generates @xmath161 .",
    "rzif is favored by small @xmath161 , and hence by small @xmath160 . on the other hand ,",
    "since rzif requires a mean field which differs from the base field , @xmath159 should be non - negligible .",
    "nonlinear saturation of amplitudes of instabilities in a more usual non - rzif context is addressed in texts such as manneville @xcite and iooss and joseph @xcite .",
    "the reasoning above does not provide an _ a priori _ reason for which an eigenvalue of the mean field would predict the frequency , since no method has been given for determining whether the oscillatory state is almost monochromatic .",
    "it does , however , connect these two properties .",
    "the frequency of a monochromatic or almost - monochromatic oscillation in a system with quadratic nonlinearity should be well predicted by the leading eigenvalue of @xmath83 .",

    "a number of fluid - dynamical researchers have attempted to relate the nonlinear frequency of a periodic state , primarily the cylinder wake , with the imaginary part of the eigenvalue of the evolution operator linearized about the temporal mean . following this line of investigation , we have studied the traveling waves and standing waves resulting from the hopf bifurcation in thermosolutal convection .",
    "the traveling waves have turned out to be a textbook case of rzif , i.e. the real part of the mean - flow eigenvalue is almost exactly zero and the imaginary part is almost exactly the frequency .",
    "in contrast the standing waves do not have this property : the mean - flow eigenvalue performs even worse than the base - flow eigenvalue at predicting the frequency .",
    "these results are displayed in our summary diagram , figure [ fig : botheigs ] .",
    "guided by these results , we have put forth a general theoretical explanation for the rzif property in terms of the temporal spectrum . if the periodic oscillation is monochromatic , then rzif is satisfied exactly .",
    "if it is not exactly monochromatic but the higher temporal harmonics are small , then rzif should be satisfied approximately .",
    "this corresponds to the traveling / standing wave dichotomy : the spectrum of the traveling waves is sharply peaked , while that of the standing waves is not .",
    "the question which remains is that of predicting the width of the spectrum of periodic states .",
    "we acknowledge funding from the agence nationale de recherche ( anr ) for the transflow project and pembroke college of cambridge university , as well as discussions with alastair rucklidge on this topic at an earlier stage of this work .",
    "because of the horizontally periodic and vertical no - slip boundary conditions , the fields can be represented as @xmath186 for which spatial derivatives are easily taken .",
    "a two - dimensional fourier transform leads to values on an equally spaced grid , where the multiplications in the poisson bracket @xmath23 of are performed .      in order to explain the method by which traveling waves are calculated , we begin by discussing the calculation of steady states .",
    "we adapt the timestepping scheme to carry out newton s method as follows @xcite : @xmath189{\\mathbf{u}}(t)\\nonumber\\\\ = \\left(i-{{\\delta t}}{\\mathcal{l}}\\right)^{-1 } & \\left[i + { { \\delta t}}{\\mathcal{n}}- \\left(i-{{\\delta t}}{\\mathcal{l}}\\right)\\right]{\\mathbf{u}}(t)\\nonumber\\\\ = \\left(i-{{\\delta t}}{\\mathcal{l}}\\right)^{-1 } & { { \\delta t}}\\left({\\mathcal{n}}+{\\mathcal{l}}\\right){\\mathbf{u}}(t ) \\label{eq : equiv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , the roots of @xmath190 are the same as those of @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the timestepping operator .",
    "the calculation holds for any value of @xmath193 regardless of size , in contrast to , whose validity as a timestepping scheme relies on a taylor series approximation in @xmath193 and so requires @xmath193 small .",
    "one newton step is then formulated as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the linearization of @xmath192 about the current solution estimate @xmath93 and @xmath196 is the decrement to be calculated and applied to @xmath93 . for large @xmath193 , the linear operator @xmath197 is well conditioned , unlike the usual jacobian operator @xmath198 .",
    "bicgstab @xcite is used to solve the linear equation for @xmath196 , thus avoiding the storage and even the construction of the jacobian operator .    in the horizontally periodic domain ,",
    "solutions are not unique but defined only up to a spatial phase ; equivalently , the jacobian is singular , with the marginal @xmath51-translation of @xmath93 as a null vector .",
    "( although the image of the jacobian @xmath199 is not of full rank , a vector produced by action of @xmath191 is always in its image . )",
    "a singular linear system can , however , be solved by iterative conjugate gradient methods without imposing any additional phase condition , since the solution is constructed from a set of vectors created by repeated action of the linear operator on an initial vector , which is unaffected by the singularity of the jacobian .",
    "the solution @xmath196 returned by bicgstab will be one of the possible solutions of , whose phase is determined by that of the right - hand - side @xmath93 .",
    "traveling wave solutions are of the form @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the unknown velocity .",
    "substituting into the governing equation leads to @xmath202 so that @xmath203 together describe a steady state .",
    "we redefine @xmath192 and its linearization as : @xmath204 \\\\ & b_{{\\mathbf{u}},v } ( { \\mathbf{u}},v ) = ( i-{{\\delta t}}{\\mathcal{l}})^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad [ { \\mathbf{u}}+{{\\delta t } } ( { \\mathcal{n}}({\\mathbf{u}},{\\mathbf{u}})+{\\mathcal{n}}({\\mathbf{u}},{\\mathbf{u}})+ v{\\partial}_x{\\mathbf{u}}- v{\\partial}_x { \\mathbf{u}})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any periodic orbit the solution is defined only up to a temporal phase . unlike in the case of a spatial phase , here it is necessary to impose an additional equation since @xmath201 is an additional unknown .",
    "the easiest option is to fix the zero - crossing of one of the elements of @xmath93 by specifying that it remain unchanged by the newton step .",
    "( since the fields we compute are deviations from the linear profile , all of them cross zero at any height @xmath54 ; any such zero - crossing can be set as a condition , i.e. @xmath205 . )",
    "since @xmath206 is to be set to zero , a computational simplification can be realized by storing @xmath207 in this element .",
    "the subroutine corresponding to the action of @xmath208 begins by extracting @xmath207 from @xmath206 , replacing @xmath206 by its imposed value of zero : @xmath209 and then acting with @xmath208 .",
    "this procedure is repeated when a solution is returned by bicgstab before decrementing : @xmath210 standing waves , which can not be calculated in this way , are computed by integrating in time while imposing reflection symmetry in @xmath51 ."
