    "inflation @xcite ( for review , @xcite ) is an vacuum - dominated epoch in the early universe when the scale factor grew exponentially .",
    "this scenario is used to set the initial condition for the hot big bang model and to provide the primordial density perturbation as the seed of structure formation . in the framework of slow - roll inflation ,",
    "the slow - roll parameters are defined by @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the spectral index can be expressed in terms of the slow - roll parameters as @xmath5 the latest wmap 5-year result prefers the spectral index around @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is given by @xmath6 with the slow - roll approximation the value of the inflaton field @xmath7 , in order to achieve @xmath8 e - folds inflation , is @xmath9 from observation @xcite @xmath10 at @xmath11 ( we call this cmb normalization ) .    in order to build a successful inflation model",
    ", we need a potential which is very flat when @xmath11 and becomes steep when inflation ends .",
    "it is difficult to achieve this form of potential by a single field without significant tuning of the coupling parameter @xcite .",
    "the idea of hybrid inflation is more natural in achieve so , in which the jobs of ending the inflation and providing the scale of inflation is done by another scalar field ( called waterfall field ) .",
    "the quadratic potential for the inflaton field @xmath7 is @xmath12 this potential is used in the case of chaotic inflation @xcite where @xmath13 is required .",
    "it can be turned into a hybrid inflation @xcite by adding a `` false vacuum '' to it @xcite : @xmath14 consequently we can have an inflation model with @xmath15 . in this case , the end of inflation is not due to the failing of slow - roll , but the tachyonic instability of the waterfall field .",
    "the idea of supernatural inflation @xcite is that the inflaton field @xmath7 is a flat direction in supersymmetric field theory and the mass term is provided by a soft susy breaking term and @xmath16 by another field coupled to the inflaton field .",
    "therefore , the model is basically a tree - level hybrid inflation model .",
    "however , this model predicts a spectral index @xmath0 .",
    "a method to reduce the spectral index in this tree - level hybrid inflation is by converting the model into `` hilltop inflation '' @xcite via introduction of a negative quartic term to the potential as shown in @xcite .",
    "the only problem here is how to introduce this quartic term and whether the coupling parameter needs fine tuning .",
    "the answer relies on the fact that the flat direction is generically affected not only by the soft susy breaking term but also the nonrenormalizable term and a - term . in this paper",
    ", we show that by considering these additional terms the spectral index can be reduced to @xmath1 in a natural fashion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ 2 ] , we introduce the scalar potential of the model . in sec .  [ 3 ] , the analytic solution base on the potential and the main result of this paper are provided .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .  [ 5 ] .",
    "suppose we want to build an inflation model based on a susy flat direction @xcite , we have to know that generically a flat direction is lifted by supersymmetry breaking terms and non - renormalizable superpotential terms @xcite , which has the form @xmath17 where @xmath7 is the flat direction and @xmath18 @xcite . therefore , the potential is @xcite ( after minimizing the potential along the angular direction ) @xmath19 by spirit of hybrid inflation we can add a `` false vacuum '' to this potential via a coupling to a waterfall field similar to the case of supernatural inflation . therefore , the potential we consider is of the following form @xmath20 if we just consider the first two terms , the result is the tree - level hybrid inflation , which is realized in supernatural inflation where the mass term comes from soft susy breaking . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the case of @xmath21 ( the least of planck - mass suppression ) , and neglect the last term ( which is possible when @xmath22 and will be justified in the following section ) .",
    "therefore , the potential is @xmath23 with @xmath24 this form of potential has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the question is whether @xmath25 and @xmath26 here need fine - tuning .",
    "the natural value of soft susy breaking terms , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are @xmath29 .",
    "the coupling @xmath30 is of @xmath31 , which makes @xmath32 . as in the case of supernatural inflation",
    ", we choose @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the intermediate scale , therefore @xmath35 . in the following section",
    ", we will apply those natural values without fine - tuning to achieve our goal of reducing the spectral index of supernatural inflation .",
    "from eq . ( [ potential ] ) , by using eq .",
    "( [ n]-[efolds ] ) we can obtain @xmath36 and @xmath37 ^ 3}{\\eta_0 ^ 3(\\eta_0 x-4\\lambda)^2}\\\\ n_s&=&1 + 2\\eta_0 \\left[1-\\frac{12\\lambda e^{2n\\eta_0}}{\\eta_0 x+4\\lambda(e^{2n\\eta_0}-1)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by imposing @xmath38 and @xmath1 , we plot @xmath39 ( at @xmath40 ) and @xmath26 as functions of @xmath25 in fig .",
    "( [ result ] ) . the reason why we plot @xmath39 is to justify that we can ignore the last term in eq . ( [ potential2 ] ) . by comparing the third and fourth terms in eq .",
    "( [ potential2 ] ) , @xmath41 is the requirement for @xmath42 .     and @xmath26 as a function of @xmath25 at @xmath40.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ result ] , when @xmath43 , @xmath44 , which means the @xmath45 term is at least @xmath46 times smaller than the @xmath47 term .",
    "therefore , the last term can only contribute about @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( compare @xmath49 with @xmath45 to the original @xmath49 obtained from cmb normalization ) , which results in less than @xmath48 correction to @xmath16 ( from cmb normalization ) .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath45 term to @xmath50 is only about @xmath51 ( compare the original @xmath50 from @xmath52 with the value coming from the @xmath45 term ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have a correction about @xmath48 to @xmath53 because of the change of @xmath16 , which only affects the spectral index at the level of @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we still achieve @xmath55 even if we include the @xmath45 term in the potential .",
    "all these justify why we ignore the last in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) from the beginning .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem requires the soft susy breaking parameters in the order of @xmath56 , otherwise some level of fine - tuning still exists .",
    "the soft parameters involved in this study are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which we have set to be @xmath57 . with these soft parameters",
    "we have achieved a desirable spectral index . as long as @xmath27 and @xmath28 are in tev",
    "scale the inflation with @xmath40-fold can be obtained with reasonable @xmath7 and @xmath26 .",
    "since we are considering soft mass parameters in tev scale , supersymmetric partners of sm fermions can be readily produced at the lhc .",
    "once these soft mass parameters are determined , parameters for the inflaton field of the inflationary model can be constrained .",
    "we will pursue this possibility in future work .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the potential of supernatural inflation can be converted into a hilltop form by introducing a @xmath28-term ( and a negligible non - renarmalizable term ) .",
    "the natural value for the soft susy breaking parameters are of the order tev , which is exactly the order that we need to reduce the spectral index , without fine - tuning , into the latest result according to wmap .    from eq .",
    "( [ potential2 ] ) , we are assuming that @xmath16 is at the scale of gravity mediated susy breaking ( and for some versions of gauge mediation ) .",
    "but the susy breaking scale in the framework of gauge mediation can be right down to @xmath58 @xcite . with the hilltop form of our potential ( but _ not _ with the original supernatural potential keeping only the quadratic term )",
    ", we can accommodate these low scales .",
    "it is interesting to notice that even @xmath59 , the model can still work ( it is the mssm inflation model ) . in that case",
    "we have a non - hybrid model . with lower @xmath16",
    "there may be a model between hybrid and non - hybrid .",
    "we will consider these issues in future work .",
