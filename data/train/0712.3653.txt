    "the fringe visibility @xmath31 is evidently smaller than the _ a priori _ fringe visibility , where @xmath32 is the initial state of the detector .",

    "a general strategy @xmath33 of extracting the which - path information is to split all the outcomes @xmath34 of measuring the observable @xmath13 into two disjoint sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 : if @xmath37 then we guess that the quanton takes path @xmath6 and if @xmath38 then we guess that the quanton takes path @xmath7 . by denoting @xmath39and similarly for @xmath40 the likelihood for guessing the path",
