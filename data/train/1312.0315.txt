    "while it is well understood how a low - mass solar - type star forms , the formation process of massive stars remains yet to be addressed .",
    "recent observations of massive young stars suggested existence of circumstellar disks around them @xcite , which favors a formation via disk accretion rather than other processes such as stellar collisions @xcite .",
    "however , physical conditions of accretion disks , especially at a scale of @xmath7100  au , are still debatable mainly due to limited spatial resolution .",
    "because of its proximity to the sun at a distance of 420  pc @xcite , orion  kl ( kleinman - low object ) has been recognized as one of the best laboratories to study massive star - formation processes . among a number of young stars , a radio source called source",
    "i is prominent in this region and is thought to have a high luminosity of @xmath510@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is the driving source of a bipolar outflow along the northeast - southwest direction with a scale of 1000  au @xcite . at the launching point of the bipolar outflow",
    ", there is a cluster of vibrationally - excited sio masers tracing an outflow arising from the surface of the disk with a diameter of @xmath7100  au , revealed by vlbi observations with resolutions of 0.8  milliarcseconds ( mas ) @xcite and 0.5  mas @xcite .",
    "a compact radio continuum source is associated at the center of the vibrationally - excited sio masers which is interpreted as an edge - on disk @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the nature of source  i and associated disk / outflow system are still far from a complete understanding . one of the long - standing issues is an origin of the radio continuum emission .",
    "while the 43  ghz continuum emission is elongated perpendicular to the northeast - southwest outflow @xcite , it seems consistent with the base of a larger scale high - velocity outflow traced by near - infrared shocked h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it has sometimes been interpreted as a radio jet toward northwest - southeast directions @xcite .    furthermore , there are continued discussions related to the mass of source  i. a rotation curve of the vibrationally - excited 43  ghz sio masers indicates an enclosed mass of @xmath5(7 - 8)@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "near - infrared reflected spectrum can be explained by an emission from a circumstellar disk around a 10@xmath6 protostar @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been claimed that source  i would consist of a massive binary system with a total mass of 20@xmath6 , given the dynamics of this region including source  i and bn ( becklin - neugebauer ) object @xcite , although these dynamical scenarios are still controversial @xcite .    physical properties of the associated disk are also under debate @xcite , which are crucial to understand massive star - formation mechanism .",
    "further observations of source  i are essential to understand not only its origin but also formation mechanisms of massive stars . for this purpose ,",
    "we here present observational results of submillimeter h@xmath0o lines detected in source  i with newly constructed atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "observations were carried out with alma on july 16 , august 25 , and october 21 , 2012 .",
    "the target source was orion  kl and the tracking center position was taken to be the bursting 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser , ra(j2000)=05h35m14.125s , decl(j2000)=-05d2236.486@xcite , which is 7  southwest of source  i. the on - source integration time was about 100  seconds for each session .",
    "the array was consisted of 21 - 28 antennas with a diameter of 12  m each in the extended configuration with the maximum baseline length of 400  m. a primary flux calibrator , band - pass calibrator , and secondary gain calibrator were callisto , j053851 - 440507/j0423 - 013 , and j0607 - 085 , respectively .",
    "two ortho - h@xmath0o lines at 321.225656  ghz ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) and 336.227931  ghz ( @xmath9-@xmath4 ) were observed simultaneously .",
    "the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line lies in the excited state in the bending mode ( @xmath10=1 ) .",
    "the lower state energy levels are 1846  k and 2939  k for the 321  ghz and 336  ghz h@xmath0o lines , respectively @xcite .",
    "the alma correlator provided four spectral windows with a bandwidth of 468.750  mhz for each .",
    "the channel spacing of spectrometers was 122  khz .",
    "the system noise temperature ranged from 100 - 200  k , depending on the observing frequency and weather conditions .",
    "synthesis imaging and self - calibration were done with the casa software package .",
    "we set a velocity resolution of 0.125  km  s@xmath11 ( corresponds to 130 - 140  khz resolution ) in the synthesized imaging of the h@xmath0o lines .",
    "first , both phase and amplitude self - calibrations were done with the continuum emission of orion  kl by integrating over line - free channels .",
    "peak intensity and rms noise level of the continuum emission are 698  mjy  beam@xmath11 and 9  mjy  beam@xmath11 , respectively .    the solutions of self - calibration were applied to all the spectral channels including the target h@xmath0o lines .",
    "we compared the continuum emission and selected spectral lines of methyl formate , hcooch@xmath12 to check the stability of the observed flux scale . as a result",
    ", we found a possible variation in continuum and line intensities between different observing sessions .",
    "it is most likely due to different array configurations which could result in different degrees of missing flux for extended emission features . on the other hand",
    ", we could not find significant flux variation of the 321  ghz and 336  ghz h@xmath0o lines as shown in figure [ fig - sp ] .",
    "this suggests that the h@xmath0o lines are emitted from a compact source and have no intrinsic time variation unlike circumstellar 321  ghz h@xmath0o masers around late - type stars @xcite .",
    "considering these results , we estimated an accuracy of flux measurements to be @xmath720% .    in order to obtain higher spatial resolution and to exclude contribution from extended emission component , we produced synthesized images of the 321  ghz and 336  ghz h@xmath0o lines as well as the continuum emission by using the uniform - weighted visibility data with a uv distance longer than 200  k@xmath13 .",
    "the resultant beam size is 0.40@xmath140.34  with a position angle of 60  degrees .",
    "the image rms noise level was @xmath730  mjy  beam@xmath11 at each channel .",
    "because these maps are free from the sidelobes caused by the strong extended emission , the noise levels are improved compared with those of full uv sampling images .",
    "we detected two h@xmath0o lines at 321  ghz and 336  ghz toward source  i ( figure [ fig - sp ] ) .",
    "although the 321  ghz line has been detected in star - forming regions @xcite , the vibrationally - excited 336  ghz line has been detected only in a red supergiant such as vy  cma @xcite .",
    "thus , this is the first detection of the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line in star - forming regions . along with another vibrationally - excited h@xmath0o line at 232  ghz newly detected with alma @xcite",
    ", these transitions will be unique tracers of massive young stars . both of the 321  ghz and",
    "336  ghz emissions are concentrated in a close vicinity of source  i. because of their high excitation energy levels , these lines clearly suggest a hot molecular gas associated with source  i. it is a striking difference from the lower - excitation 22  ghz h@xmath0o masers ( lower state energy level of 642  k ) spread over the bipolar outflow with a much larger scale of 1000  au@xcite .",
    "the spatial structure of the integrated intensity map of the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line shows an elongation along the northeast - southwest direction , which is indicative of the bipolar outflow @xcite , whereas the 336  ghz map is more compact than the 321  ghz map and its extent is comparable to the present resolution ( figure [ fig - map ] ) .    to evaluate their structures , we made velocity centroid maps ( peak positions of velocity channel maps ) of both lines by performing two dimensional gaussian fitting to the synthesized images .",
    "the positional uncertainty is proportional to the synthesized beam size and is inversely proportional to the signal - to - noise ratio of the images . at the peak velocity channel of the 336  ghz",
    "h@xmath0o line , the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath730 , and hence , the positional accuracy is estimated to be as high as 0.01 .",
    "formal errors in the gaussian fitting , 0.005 - 0.02(1@xmath15 ) , are almost consistent with this expectation .",
    "the 321  ghz map shows an inverted z - shaped structure with sharp ridges at northwestern and southeastern sides connected by linearly aligned features ( figure [ fig - centroid](a ) ) .",
    "this appears quite similar to previous interferometer maps of vibrationally - excited ( @xmath16=1 , 2 ) @xmath17sio masers , as well as ground state ( @xmath16=0 ) @xmath18sio and @xmath19sio masers , at 43  ghz and 86  ghz @xcite .",
    "thus , the vibrationally - excited sio masers and the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line trace the same dynamical structure excited at the base of the northeast - southwest outflows @xcite .",
    "in fact , the 321  ghz h@xmath0o line is detected in a bipolar outflow associated with another nearby massive star - forming region cepheus  a @xcite .",
    "the resemblance of 321  ghz h@xmath0o emission and previous vibrationally - excited sio maser observations ensures that the distribution of the h@xmath0o emission traced by alma is reliable and can be compared with higher angular resolution maps of vlbi observations .    on the other hand ,",
    "the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line map perfectly fits the dark lane devoid of the vibrationally - excited sio masers in an x - shaped distribution obtained with higher resolution vlbi at 43  ghz ( figure [ fig - centroid](b)(c ) ) @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the 336  ghz h@xmath0o channel maps , @xmath70.2@xmath140.1(84au@xmath1442au ) , is comparable with the size of the 43  ghz continuum emission @xcite .",
    "it is most likely that the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line is emitted from a midplane of the disk as traced by the 43  ghz continuum emission .",
    "the most important finding is a clear velocity gradient along the northwest - southeast direction ( figure [ fig - pv](a ) ) .",
    "the gradient is analogous to that of the vibrationally - excited sio masers @xcite , and is perpendicular to the northeast - southwest outflow @xcite .",
    "the quasi - linear velocity gradient with a lack of the highest velocity components close to the central position suggests that the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line is emitted from a rotating ring - like structure or limb of the disk in an edge - on view .",
    "if we simply assume a linear velocity gradient of the rotating edge - on ring with a radius of 42  au , the enclosed mass is estimated to be 5@xmath6 . although this value is smaller than the previous estimate of @xmath5(7 - 8)@xmath6 @xcite , a slightly larger radius of 47  au yields a consistent value of 7@xmath6 .",
    "these results are much lower than another estimate , 20@xmath6 , according to the conservation of momentum of source  i and bn object estimated from their proper motions @xcite .",
    "because the mass derived from the velocity gradient , ( 5 - 7)@xmath6 , is regarded as a rotationally supported part of the system , it could be a lower limit of the total mass of source  i. if this is the case , it implies that non - gravitational forces such as magnetic field and/or radiation pressure would efficiently support the source  i system @xcite .",
    "one might claim that the h@xmath0o lines could trace a bipolar outflow along the northwest - southeast direction @xcite .",
    "however , if the h@xmath0o lines and radio continuum emission trace the same volume of this outflow , the expansion velocity would be @xmath720  km  s@xmath11 assuming a moderate inclination of the outflow axis of 45  degrees .",
    "it corresponds to a proper motion of 0.01  arcsec  yr@xmath11 , which is inconsistent with a stable structure of the 43  ghz continuum emission @xcite .",
    "a radial expansion or infall are also unlikely because of a lack of the highest radial velocity components toward the central position in the observed position - velocity ( pv ) diagram ( figure [ fig - pv](a ) ) and a broad wing components in the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line spectrum ( figure [ fig - pv](b ) ) .",
    "thus , 336  ghz h@xmath0o line map provides a further evidence of a rotating circumstellar disk around source  i.",
    "in order to reconstruct observed pv diagram and spectral profile of the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line , we here employ a model of an edge - on rotating disk assuming a ring - like structure with uniform temperature / density for simplicity .",
    "because of a limited spatial resolution ( 0.4=168  au ) , it is hard to solve a degeneracy of disk parameters , such as mass , size , and temperature , based on our present observations with a single transition at 336  ghz .",
    "thus , what we have done is a proof - of - concept model calculation to demonstrate that the observed pv diagram and spectral profile can be indeed explained with reasonable physical and dynamical parameters consistent with previous observations .",
    "first , we calculated models for several parameter set of inner and outer radii of the ring , @xmath20=5 , 15 , 25 , 35 , 45 , 55  au and @xmath21=40 , 50 , and 60  au with a constraint of @xmath22 , for a fixed enclosed mass @xmath23=7@xmath6 ( rotationally supported mass ) consistent with previously estimated lower limits @xcite . as a result , the model with @xmath20=45  au and @xmath21=50  au",
    "is found to well reproduce the observed pv diagram and spectral profile ( i.e. model ( 1 ) in figure [ fig - pv ] ) .",
    "if we assume smaller inner radii , models show steeper velocity gradients and higher velocity components close to the central position .",
    "furthermore , smaller inner radii yield broader linewidths which result in larger discrepancy between observed and model profile .",
    "thus , our results prefer the ring - like structure rather than a disk without a central hole .",
    "next , we verify models with different enclosed masses . when we employ a larger mass of @xmath23=10@xmath6 ,",
    "the velocity gradient becomes steeper and the spectral profile becomes broader similar to the model with smaller ring size ( model ( 2 ) in figures [ fig - pv ] ) .",
    "when we fit the model spectrum with @xmath23=10@xmath6 to the observed line profile , we should have assumed the larger disk size of @xmath2470  au .",
    "however , widths of position offsets of such model pv diagrams became significantly larger than the observed results .",
    "therefore , our results prefer lower value of @xmath77@xmath6 consistent with the previous vlbi results @xcite .",
    "finally , we estimate the excitation temperature of the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line , @xmath25 , by fitting the observed line profile , assuming @xmath23=7@xmath6 , @xmath20=45  au and @xmath21=50  au , respectively .",
    "we find that the observed spectral profile can be reconciled with an excitation temperature of @xmath53000  k and a uniform h@xmath0o density of 5@xmath1410@xmath26  @xmath27 ( e.g. models ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) in figure [ fig - pv](b ) ) .",
    "when we assume lower excitation temperatures , the dip of the double - peaked profile becomes shallower due to the increase of optical depth ( model ( 4 ) in figure [ fig - pv](b ) ) .",
    "note that these values could not be constrained due to a lack of multi - transition data for an excitation analysis such as rotation diagram method .",
    "although we can not rule out a possibility of excitation of the 336  ghz h@xmath0o line via maser action , it is proposed to be thermalized via collisional and/or radiative excitation in a red supergiant vy  cma @xcite , which is consistent with a theoretical prediction @xcite . under this condition ,",
    "its excitation temperature directly reflects a high kinetic temperature .",
    "furthermore , because existence of h@xmath0o suggests an absence of fully ionized gas , the temperature would be lower than @xmath74500  k as estimated from radio and infrared observations @xcite .",
    "the temperature range of 3000 - 4500  k is significantly higher than that expected for a radiative equilibrium with the expected luminosity of source  i , 10@xmath28 - 10@xmath29 ( @xmath71000",
    "k ) . along with the ring - like structure",
    ", it may imply a heating mechanism via accretion shock in the disk midplane @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the ring - like structure may trace the edge of the disk because of a high opacity of the disk even at 336  ghz .",
    "in fact , the continuum emission of source  i , which could be interpreted as an h@xmath30 free - free emission @xcite , shows a spectral energy distribution with a power - law index close to 2 ( hirota et al . in preparation ) .",
    "higher frequency observations of continuum and h@xmath0o lines will discriminate these hypothesis .",
    "we detected a hot neutral circumstellar disk rotating around source  i with a scale of 100  au in diameter .",
    "we derived the rotationally supported enclosed mass of 7@xmath6 , which could be a lower limit of the total mass of the source  i system . because the fully ionized h region is not significantly evolved , source  i would be in a very early phase of massive protostar being formed via the disk accretion @xcite . nevertheless , the estimated parameters of the disk , such as inner / outer radii of the ring - like structure , enclosed mass or rotationally supported mass , and excitation temperature , are still uncertain because of a lack of spatially resolved data .",
    "in fact , we still see some deviation between the model and observed results in pv diagram and spectral profile . further higher angular resolution observations with alma of the multi - transition h@xmath0o lines will be crucial to shed light on more detailed physical and dynamical properties of the massive protostar source  i and its surrounding circumstellar disk .    we are grateful to t. hosokawa , m. momose , h. nomura , n. sakai , and s. yamamoto for valuable discussions and k. hada and a. kataoka for useful comments .",
