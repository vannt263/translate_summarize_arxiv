    "clouds of superfluid fermion pairs were created in a new experimental setup @xcite using techniques similar to those described elsewhere @xcite . in brief , a combination of laser cooling and sympathetic cooling of spin polarized fermions by bosonic @xmath29na  was followed by a spin transfer to create a two component fermi gas , allowing further cooling via direct evaporation of the fermions . as the fermions cooled , they formed pairs which bose - condensed .    estimates of the scattering length and hence the interaction parameter from magnetic field were obtained using @xmath30 @xcite , where @xmath31 is measured in gauss , and @xmath32 is the bohr radius .",
    "the calibration of the magnetic field in our system had an uncertainty of about 5 g.    evaporation was performed at a magnetic field of 822 g , where strong interactions allowed for efficient evaporation .",
    "an estimated average final number of @xmath33 @xmath3lipairs and harmonic trapping frequencies of @xmath34 hz gave a trap depth of 1.7 @xmath9k and fermi energy @xmath35 @xmath9k , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the average trapping frequency .",
    "after evaporation , the magnetic field was brought to a desired value @xmath38 in 20 ms and the condensate allowed to equilibrate for a further 200 ms . before ramping to values of @xmath38 on the bcs side",
    ", we also recompressed the optical trap to @xmath39 hz and 2.2 @xmath9k depth in 100 ms to accommodate the larger fermi clouds above the resonance @xcite .",
    "a three - dimensional optical lattice was formed from three optical standing waves , oriented such that the resulting unit cell has a sheared cubic structure , with one axis tilted @xmath8 20 degrees from the normal for reasons of optical access ( see fig .",
    "1a ) @xcite .",
    "the incident laser beams were focused down to the condensate with waists of @xmath8 90 @xmath9 m , then retro - reflected and overlapped at the condensate to generate the standing wave potentials .",
    "all lattice light was derived from a 1064 nm single frequency fiber laser , and each beam was detuned tens of mhz with respect to the others to eliminate interference between different beams .",
    "the lattice potential was imposed onto the condensate by adiabatically increasing the intensity of the laser beams to a variable final value @xmath18 .",
    "the calibration of @xmath18 had an uncertainty of about 20 percent .",
    "a simple linear ramp with a constant rate @xmath40 of 0.5 @xmath16  per ms was used unless otherwise specified .",
    "this satisfies the interband adiabaticity condition of @xmath41 .",
    "ballistic expansion for the detection of the different momentum components was provided by a magnetic field sequence ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) that quickly brought the system out of the strongly interacting regime when all confinement was switched off . during the magnetic field ramp of about 150 @xmath9s , the lattice potential was kept on .",
    "the first 2 ms of expansion took place at 470 g , where the molecules are tightly bound , before the field was ramped back up to 730 g in the next 4.5 ms , at which the weakly bound molecules strongly absorb light near the atomic resonance line and could be observed by absorption imaging .",
    "the specific magnetic field sequence was chosen to minimize collisions within technical capabilities ."

    "<S> the fermion pair size is on the order of @xmath7 nm , comparable to the lattice spacing of 532 nm . to probe the momentum distribution , we ramped the magnetic field out of the strongly interacting regime as fast as technically possible ( @xmath8 150 @xmath9s ) and then turned off the confining potential . </S>",

    "<S> this degradation could be due to a higher fraction of thermal atoms as we approached the bcs limit , but was not studied in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> the narrow interference peaks clearly reveal the presence of a macroscopic wavefunction possessing long range phase coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the separation between the interference peaks relative to their width gives an estimate of the coherence length of @xmath13 lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is a lower bound , because effects of finite resolution and mechanisms of residual broadening have been neglected . with unity occupation , and in the absence of any discernible background at magnetic fields near the feshbach resonance , this implies a minimum phase space density of @xmath14 , and shows that our samples are deep in the quantum - degenerate regime . in previous studies of ultracold bose and fermi gases , the appearance of a condensate fraction and long range phase coherence was shown to occur concurrently with the possibility to excite superfluid flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superfluid hydrodynamics is usually regarded as the direct proof for superfluidity . </S>",

    "<S> 4 displays the peak optical density of the interference peaks for different lattice depths at representative fields . across all fields , </S>",
    "<S> the sharp decrease in peak optical density occurred between 5 and 6 @xmath16  . </S>",
    "<S> further increase of the magnetic field resulted in decreasing overall visibility , until interference peaks could no longer be observed regardless of lattice depth .        </S>",
    "<S> the loss of phase coherence with increasing lattice depth is consistent with the qualitative description of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , the usual single - band description is no longer applicable , since in the strong - coupling regime the on - site interaction strength should be comparable to the band gap @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the onsite trap frequency . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , pauli blocking forbids the multiple occupation of the lowest state of an individual lattice site by identical fermions , and modification of the single particle tunneling rate is expected due to virtual pair breaking transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one may still be tempted to use the standard bosonic hubbard model and estimate the critical lattice depth @xmath21 for an assumed value of onsite interaction energy @xmath22 and non - interacting , single particle tunneling @xmath23 , but the obtained @xmath24 @xmath16  is significantly smaller than our observation , which is in turn much smaller than the @xmath25 @xmath16  observed for weakly interacting atomic becs @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3h demonstrates the reversibility of the transition from a long range coherent state to a state without strong coherence . </S>",
    "<S> we now study the time scale for this recoherence , in analogy with similar measurements performed across the superfluid to mott - insulator transition in atomic becs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 shows that phase coherence was restored on a sub - millisecond time scale , on the order of the the single - particle tunneling time of about 500 @xmath9s ( for a shallow lattice of 2.5 @xmath16  ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the same lattice ramp sequence was applied to a superfluid which had been dephased by a magnetic field gradient @xcite the system did not regain phase coherence on the time scales that we probed . therefore , evaporative cooling is negligible during this time . </S>",
    "<S> the short recoherence time of the condensate is evidence that the system stayed in its ground state or at least in a low entropy state when the lattice was ramped up .     </S>",

    "<S> all points were taken for 6.5 ms time - of - flight.,width=240 ]    fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 also provides evidence that the system could not recohere during the 150 @xmath9s magnetic field ramp . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3h , the central peak is well fitted by a bimodal distribution with a width of 35 @xmath9 m , in clear contrast to the gaussian width of 105 @xmath9 m obtained from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 after 150 @xmath9s . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the observed interference patterns in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 reflect the coherence of the cloud at the initial magnetic field , in the strongly interacting regime .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown long range phase coherence of fermion pairs in an optical lattice in the bec - bcs crossover region by observing sharp interference peaks during ballistic expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that we have achieved strong @xmath0-wave pairing and superfluidity in a lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> further studies will reveal how the pair wavefunction is affected by confinement @xcite , and whether the lattice shifts the bec - bcs crossover away from the feshbach resonance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the loss of coherence during the lattice ramp up and the rapid recoherence are characteristic of a mott - insulator </S>",
    "<S> . however , definitive proof requires a better understanding of the unitarity - limited interactions in such a fermi system . </S>",
