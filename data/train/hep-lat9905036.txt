    "lattice qcd provides a promising approach for a first - principles calculation of the hadronic matrix elements of @xmath0 meson relevant for a precision determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "the most important matrix elements is the @xmath0 meson leptonic decay constant @xmath8 : it is needed to determine @xmath12 ; from the lattice technical point of view it is the simplest @xmath0 meson matrix element calculable in lattice qcd with which one can study systematic errors associated with a lattice treatment of heavy quark .",
    "the need for a careful examination of systematic errors stems from the fact that their magnitude for naive quark actions such as the wilson action is of @xmath13 with @xmath14 the heavy quark mass .",
    "hence errors of this origin can exceed 100% for a typical lattice spacing of @xmath15gev used in present simulations . to overcome this problem ,",
    "recent lattice studies of @xmath8  @xcite employ non - relativistic effective theory of qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite or a non - relativistic interpretation of the relativistic lattice quark action for heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "nrqcd is an effective theory formulated as an expansion in @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the spatial covariant derivative which is of @xmath18 in the heavy - light system . for nrqcd one",
    "has to choose the coefficients of the expansion by imposing a matching condition with the full theory .",
    "this can be made using perturbation theory .",
    "in practice one has to truncate both non - relativistic expansion and perturbative expansion at some order so that the systematic error in nrqcd calculations is organized as a double expansion in @xmath19 and the strong coupling constant @xmath20 .",
    "an additional source of systematic errors is the discretization error proportional to some power of @xmath21 .",
    "since nrqcd is valid only when @xmath22 , the continuum limit @xmath23 can not be taken . therefore",
    ", removing discretization errors is more important in this formalism than in the usual relativistic formulations for which continuum extrapolations can in principle be made .",
    "for this reason , in many lattice nrqcd calculations , the correction terms to remove @xmath21 and even @xmath24 errors were introduced .    until recently the matching coefficients for the action  @xcite and the current operators  @xcite have been available only at one - loop level without operator mixing .",
    "this means that @xmath25 and @xmath26 errors had been left unremoved .",
    "recently , shigemitsu and morningstar carried out a one - loop calculation necessary for an @xmath25 and @xmath26 improvement of the heavy - light axial vector current  @xcite . the first simulation including this improvement was performed by ali  khan _ et al . _",

    "we investigate in detail the effect of one - loop improvement of the heavy - light axial vector current as a function of the lattice spacing .",

    "the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 should be determined by matching the action to the continuum relativistic qcd action by either resorting to perturbation theory or estimating it non - perturbatively so as to reproduce the same theory in each order of the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "so far even perturbative results are not available for these coefficients .",
    "we adopt the tree - level value @xmath72 and @xmath73 in our work , applying , however , the mean - field improvement to all the link variables in the action and the fwt transformation with the replacement @xmath74 , where we take @xmath75  @xcite .",

    "we , therefore , take an average over the two results at @xmath4=6.1 and 5.9 to quote our final result . in doing so",
    ", we have confirmed that the difference between 6.1 and 5.9 is within the estimated systematic error , as it should be .",
    "in addition to the above systematic uncertainties , we must include an uncertainty in the lattice scale @xmath116 . throughout this work we have used the scale set with the string tension @xmath208 .",
    "taking a variation of the ratio @xmath209 over @xmath210 and 6.3 , we assign a 3.5% error in the lattice scale as we did in ref .",

    "our final result for the @xmath0 meson decay constant in the quenched approximation is given by @xmath211 here the central value is an average over the results at @xmath4=6.1 and 5.9 , and the errors are statistical and systematic in the given order .",
    "the systematic error includes 8% as estimated in the previous subsection and the error in the lattice scale of 3.5% , added in quadrature . for @xmath29 there is an additional uncertainty from the strange quark mass .",
    "we take the value from the @xmath212 meson mass ( @xmath113 ) for our central value . employing the @xmath213 mass ( @xmath114 )",
    "gives a larger @xmath29 , which is given in the final error .",
    "our result is higher than that of ali  khan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite at @xmath4=6.0 ( @xmath8 = 147(11)(16 ) mev and @xmath29= 175(8)(18 ) mev ) , though consistent within one standard deviation . to compare with the results obtained with the the @xmath32-improved clover action , we quote from the studies of the fermilab  @xcite group and of jlqcd  @xcite , @xmath214 our values with nrqcd are in good agreement with these relativistic calculations .",
    "many of systematic uncertainties that appear in the calculation of the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath216 cancel , if we consider the ratio @xmath217 .",
    "in particular , the two - loop uncertainty in the matching of the axial current cancels out explicitly .",
    "figure  [ fig : f_p_s / f_p_vs_1/m_p ] presents the @xmath152 dependence of @xmath217 .",
    "we observe only a mild @xmath152 dependence .",
    "the difference between nrqcd - i and nrqcd - ii is much smaller than the statistical error , which shows that the contribution of the @xmath48 terms is negligible . finally , plotting the ratio as a function of lattice spacing ( see figure  [ fig : f_b_s / f_b_vs_a ] ) , we find the results at three @xmath4 values to be consistent with each other within the estimated errors .",
    "our result is @xmath218 which is obtained by averaging data at @xmath4=6.1 and 5.9 .",
    "the errors given are those from statistical , systematic and uncertainty in @xmath112 . for the systematic error the leading contribution arises from the lack of the strange quark mass dependent renormalization , which is @xmath26 for the deviation @xmath219 .",
    "the magnitude is 3 - 5% assuming the order counting .",
    "a byproduct of our simulation is the mass difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath199 mesons , which can be compared with experiment .",
    "since the heavy quark mass cancels in this difference , there are no direct perturbative corrections for this quantity , though they enter implicitly through determination of the bare @xmath119-quark mass .",
    "we plot the @xmath152 dependence of the @xmath35 mass difference in figure  [ fig : m_p_s - m_p_vs_1/m_p ] , where we observe the dependence to be small .",
    "the lattice spacing dependence is shown in figure  [ fig : m_b_s - m_b_vs_a ] .",
    "a variation of about 20% , beyond the statistical error of 8% , is seen between the data at @xmath4=6.1 and 5.9 , which may represent scaling violation effects .",
    "our result from an average over @xmath4=6.1 and 5.9 is given by @xmath220 where , as before , the errors represent statistical , systematic and @xmath112 uncertainty .",
    "the possible systematic error is @xmath202 , which is 2 - 3% , and the uncertainty of @xmath116@xmath207 3.5% .",
    "we estimate the error at 5% adding them in quadrature .",
    "the dominant error is the uncertainty of @xmath112 .",
    "it is encouraging that our result agrees with experimental value @xmath221 mev .",
    "the hyperfine splitting @xmath222 is another experimentally measured quantity .",
    "previous lattice studies in the quenched approximation have found that the hyperfine splitting of heavy - light and heavy - heavy mesons are much smaller than experiment  @xcite .",
    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is an inappropriate value of the coupling @xmath223 for the @xmath224 term , for which we use the tadpole improved tree - level value .",
    "since the hyperfine splitting of heavy - light mesons is proportional to @xmath223 , and that of heavy - heavy mesons to @xmath225 , it is possible that large corrections of @xmath106 remain ( the non - perturbative calculation of this coupling has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , which reports the possible @xmath106 correction ) .",
    "another possible source is the quenched approximation .",
    "the @xmath152 dependence of the hyperfine splitting obtained in our simulation is shown in figure  [ fig : hyperfine_vs_1/m_p ] .",
    "we observe that in the static limit the splitting linearly vanishes due to the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "figure  [ fig : htperfine_vs_a ] shows the lattice spacing dependence of the splitting together with the experimental value of @xmath226 mev . while scaling is reasonably satisfied with our results , the magnitude is far below experiment . averaging the two values at @xmath4=6.1 and 5.9 , we find @xmath227 where we assume a 20% systematic error since the @xmath106 correction is not known for @xmath223 .",
    "in this article we have presented a scaling study of the heavy - light meson decay constant using lattice nrqcd with the heavy - light current improved to @xmath2 and to @xmath3 consistently to the one - loop order in perturbation theory taking into account mixings with the relevant higher dimensional operators .",
    "we have found the effect of the improvement to be substantial : the large @xmath7 dependence of @xmath8 is almost removed by the improvement .",
    "this is most apparent in the static limit , where the effect is purely @xmath2 , but a similar effect is also seen for the physical @xmath0 mass .",
    "the two main sources of systematic errors in our results are perturbative two - loop corrections , @xmath200 , in the renormalization factors for the nrqcd action , @xmath32-improved wilson action and the axial vector current , and the one - loop corrections of @xmath205 in the coefficients of the nrqcd action and the axial vector current .",
    "the former uncertainty is quite large at @xmath228 , but diminishes to a 5% level at weaker couplings of @xmath197 and 6.1 .",
    "the latter error , on the other hand , increases toward smaller lattice spacings , reaching @xmath207 6% at @xmath189 .",
    "this counter increase of error represents the limitation of lattice nrqcd itself ; the method breaks down once the heavy quark mass becomes smaller than the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "the validity of a lattice nrqcd calculation of @xmath8 hinges on the existence of a window in lattice spacing over which the two errors as well as scaling violations are small .",
    "we find these conditions to be satisfied at @xmath229 where the combined systematic errors are estimated to be 8% ( including the truncation in the @xmath1 expansion ) .",
    "achieving better accuracy with nrqcd would require two - loop calculations to extend the window toward larger lattice spacings where the @xmath205 error will become smaller .",
    "another method for calculating heavy quark quantities on the lattice is the non - relativistic interpretation of relativistic actions  @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that a continuum extrapolation can be carried out . the simulations by refs .",
    "@xcite have shown that the @xmath7 dependence in the heavy - light decay constant is small for currently accessible range of @xmath230 . a continuum extrapolation , with either constant or linear fit in the lattice spacing ,",
    "has yielded the decay constants with a systematic error of about 10% . a subtle point with this method",
    ", however , is that the @xmath7 dependence of systematic errors is non - linear .",
    "hence , strictly speaking , it is not correct to extrapolate the result with a simple linear or quadratic function of @xmath7 . to achieve a prediction of the @xmath0 meson decay constant more accurate than is available",
    ", one needs to improve the action and currents so that the systematic errors at finite values of @xmath4 are further reduced . in this sense",
    "the study of @xmath2 improvement should be necessary .    in spite of the limitations still",
    "inherent in the present results with nrqcd and with relativistic actions , we find it encouraging that the efforts with the two approaches have now yielded predictions for the @xmath0 meson decay constant in mutual agreement within the total error of about 10% for quenched qcd .",
