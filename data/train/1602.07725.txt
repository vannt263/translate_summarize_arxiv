    "a major goal of most calculus - based introductory physics courses is to help students develop the thinking skills of a physicist  @xcite .",
    "physicists comfortably exploit symmetries to turn complicated problems into simpler ones .",
    "gauss law of electricity is an important topic in the second semester of most calculus - based introductory physics courses .",
    "learning to reason whether gauss s law can be exploited in a particular situation to calculate the electric field without complicated integrals can provide an excellent context for helping students develop a good grasp of symmetry considerations .",
    "unfortunately , students often memorize a collection of formulas for the magnitude of the electric field obtained using gauss s law for spherical , cylindrical , and planar geometries without paying attention to symmetry considerations involved in obtaining those results or even understanding the difference between the electric field and electric flux .",
    "therefore , a majority of students have difficulty identifying situations where gauss law may be useful and overgeneralize results obtained for a highly symmetric charge distribution to situations where they are not applicable .",
    "courses often do not sufficiently emphasize symmetry considerations or the chain of reasoning required to determine if gauss law is useful for calculating the electric field .",
    "we administered free response and multiple - choice questions and conducted interviews with individual students using a think - aloud protocol  @xcite to understand the difficulties students have with the concepts of symmetry , electric field and electric flux .",
    "then , we developed a conceptual multiple - choice test that addresses these issues and administered it to 168 students in three different courses .",
    "the tests and interviews assess the extent to which students have become proficient in exploiting symmetry and in making conceptual predictions about the magnitude and direction of the electric field for a given charge distribution using coulomb s or gauss laws .",
    "they also assess whether students can distinguish between electric field and electric flux , identify situations in which gauss law can easily be used to calculate the electric field strength from the information about the electric flux and the shapes of the gaussian surfaces that would be appropriate in those cases .",
    "investigation of student difficulties related to a particular physics concept is important for designing instructional strategies to reduce them  @xcite .",
    "our investigations of student difficulties with discerning symmetry and applying gauss law was performed using two methods : ( 1 ) design and administration of free - response and multiple - choice questions to elicit difficulties in a particular context , and ( 2 ) in - depth audio - taped interviews with individual students using a think - aloud protocol  @xcite while they solved those problems .",
    "the major advantage of written tests is that they can be administered to large student populations .",
    "when administered in conjunction with in - depth interviews with a subset of students , written tests can be very helpful in pinpointing student difficulties . while a student can always calculate the electric field using coulomb s law and their knowledge of the principle of superposition without regard to symmetry , determining electric field using gauss law requires an explicit focus on the symmetry of the charge distribution .",
    "although there are only three types of symmetry ( spherical , cylindrical , and planar ) for which gauss law can easily be exploited to determine the electric field at various points from the information about the electric flux , students need help in identifying when these symmetries are present .",
    "the principle of superposition is also a pre - requisite for employing gauss law successfully to determine the electric field and helps determine if sufficient charge symmetry exists in a particular situation .",
    "in addition to the consideration of symmetry , the area vector and the electric flux are new concepts that are introduced in the context of gauss law .",
    "students must be able to distinguish the electric flux from the electric field , a task that turns out to be extremely difficult .",
    "students must learn that the electric flux , a measure of the total number of electric field lines passing through an _ area _ , is a scalar ( which can have both positive and negative signs depending upon the relative directions of the electric field and area vector ) while the electric field at a point is a vector .",
    "they must understand that the electric flux and the electric field even have different dimensions .",
    "students must also understand that gauss law only applies to closed surfaces and that for any closed surface , information about the net charge enclosed is sufficient to determine the net electric flux through it . on the other hand ,",
    "determination of the electric field at various points due to a charge distribution is not simple because it depends on the exact manner in which charges are distributed and may depend upon both the charges inside and outside the closed surface .",
    "for example , the electric field at various points on a gaussian surface may be non - zero and vary from point to point even though the net electric flux through it is zero if the net charge enclosed is zero .    during the design of the multiple - choice test on symmetry and gauss law , we paid particular attention to the important issues of reliability and validity  @xcite .",
    "reliability refers to the relative degree of consistency between testing if the test procedures were repeated for an individual or group .",
    "validity refers to the appropriateness of test score interpretation .",
    "the test design began with the development of a test blueprint which provided a comprehensive framework for planning decisions about the desired test attributes .",
    "the rest of the test design proceeded in a manner similar to that described for the energy and momentum conceptual survey  @xcite , and will be described in detail elsewhere .",
    "the final version of the test contains 25 items .",
    "it was administered to a total of 168 students in three different introductory calculus - based physics courses at pitt .",
    "one of these was an honors course , and the students in the other two courses had used some preliminary tutorials on symmetry and gauss law .",
    "the average score on the test is approximately @xmath0 .",
    "the reliability coefficient @xmath1  @xcite ( a measure of the internal consistency of the test ) is @xmath2 which is considered good from the test design standards .",
    "the point biserial discimination is related to the ability of a question to discriminate between students who overall did well on the test vs. those whose overall performance on the test was poor .",
    "this discrimination index for 16 questions on the test was more than @xmath3 .",
    "only 4 questions had discrimination index less than @xmath4 ( only one question with less than 0.2 ) which is also very good from the test design standards  @xcite .",
    "below , we discuss some of the questions on the test :     + you perform two experiments ( see figure ) in which you distribute charge @xmath5 differently on an isolated hollow insulating sphere : + exp(i ) : you put identical charges , @xmath6 each , on the spherical surface in six localized blobs ( you can consider them point charges ) such that the adjacent blobs are equidistant from each other .",

    "the most common difficulty with question ( 2 ) was assuming that the electric field inside the sphere in experiment ( i ) is also zero everywhere . in interviews and free response questions ,",
    "some students explained their response by claiming that the electric field inside a sphere ( or inside an object of any shape with charges on its surface ) is always zero . when probed further",
    ", some students mentioned that this had to do with electrical shielding which guaranteed that the electric field will be zero inside .",
    "even when interviewers drew students attention to the fact that the sphere was made of insulating material , students adhered to the idea that the field inside must be zero everywhere .",

    ", some students explicitly claimed that the area vector of the side surface is perpendicular to the direction of the electric field lines .",
    "therefore , the electric field must be zero at point b. this kind of confusion between the electric field at a point and the contribution to the electric flux from a certain area was found in other questions as well .",
    "the most common difficulty with question ( 4 ) was that students did not realize that both statements ( i ) and ( ii ) are correct .",
    "the table above shows that many students only chose option ( i ) or ( ii ) but not both .",
    "questions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) were extremely difficult for students .",
    "students were not comfortable with the statement of gauss law that relates the net flux through a closed surface to the net charge enclosed .",
    "they also could not differentiate between electric flux through a closed surface and electric field at a point on the surface .",
    "for example , in question ( 5 ) , many students chose ( i ) ( or ( i ) and ( iii ) ) and claimed in interviews and free response questions that only those surfaces can be used to determine the net electric flux through them because the other surfaces did not have the correct symmetry .",
    "some students were also unsure about the distinction between open and closed surfaces and the fact that gauss law only applies to closed surfaces .",
    "for example , in interviews and free response questions , many students claimed that the net flux should be the same through all surfaces ( including the square sheet ) using gauss law . in question ( 6 ) , students had to choose the gaussian surfaces that would help them determine the electric field at point p easily due to the infinite line of charge .",
    "all of the alternative choices were selected with an almost even frequency .",
    "students were often unsure about the symmetry concepts relevant for making appropriate decisions and those who chose option ( c ) were often quite confident that the magnitude of the electric field due to the infinite line must be the same at every point on the cube as well .",
    "gauss law provides an excellent opportunity to help students learn symmetry ideas and to develop their reasoning and problem solving skills .",
    "we are currently implementing and refining several tutorials that we have developed to help students learn to discern the symmetry of a charge distribution , determine whether gauss law can easily be applied to calculate the electric field strength at various points due to a given charge distribution , and predict the shape of the corresponding gaussian surface if a high symmetry exists .",
    "the tutorials also help students learn to distinguish between the electric field and the electric flux , understand that the electric flux is not a vector while the electric field is , learn the superposition principle and determine if the electric field at two points is the same in magnitude and/or direction due to a given charge distribution .",
    "the tutorials in this series also help students calculate the electric field at various points due to highly symmetric charge distributions and revisit superposition principle after learning gauss law , for example , to determine the net electric field due to two spheres of charge .",
