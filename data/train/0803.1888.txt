    "the optical properties of cold atomic gases can be radically modified by laser beams@xcite .",
    "a strong laser light essentially influences atomic states , quantum coherence and interference between the excitation pathways controlling the optical response become possible , and the absorption of weak laser light vanishes .",
    "this effect was termed electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit)@xcite . the phenomenon of eit has been deeply studied in atomic physics@xcite-@xcite , starting from its observation in sodium vapors@xcite , where the effect of eit in atomic system has disclosed new possibilities for nonlinear optics and quantum information processing . for example , few works have demonstrated that eit can be used to suppress both single - photon and two - photon absorptions in three - level atomic medium@xcite .",
    "the schemes for suppressing absorption of the short - wavelength light based on eit have also been proposed@xcite .",
    "in particular , few authors analyzed and discussed suppressed both two- and three - photon absorptions in four - wave mixing ( fwm ) and hyper - raman scattering ( hrs ) in resonant coherent atomic medium via eit@xcite .    as we know",
    ", it is easy to implement eit in optically dense atomic medium in gases phase , but it is more difficult to observe eit in solid - state medium due to the short coherence times in solid - state system@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some investigations have demonstrated eit effect and ultraslow optical pulse propagation in semiconductor quantum wells ( qw ) structure@xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , sadeghi et al.@xcite , in an asymmetric qw , have shown that eit may be obtained with appropriate driving fields , provided that the coherence between the intersubbands considered is preserved for a sufficiently long time .",
    "so that quantum coherence and interference in qw structures have also attracted great interesting due to the potentially important applications in optoelectronics and solid - state quantum information science .",
    "in fact , except for the investigations of eit , autler - townes splitting@xcite , gain without inversion@xcite , modified rabi oscillations and controlled population transfer@xcite , largely enhanced second harmonic generation@xcite , controlled optical bistability@xcite , ultrafast all - optical switching@xcite , phase - controlled behavior of absorption and dispersion@xcite , coherent population trapping@xcite , enhanced refraction index without absorption@xcite , fwm@xcite , and several other phenomena@xcite-@xcite , have been theoretically studied and experimentally observed in intersubband transitions of semiconductor qw .",
    "in addition , we take notice of the calculation of the model for an asymmetric semiconductor coupled double quantum well@xcite-@xcite , in which the realization of a photon switch and the optical bistability have been studied based on quantum interference between intersubband transitions in this system@xcite .",
    "the aim of our current study is to analyze and discuss the probe absorption properties for the two cases of transient- and steady - state processes in such system .",
    "different from the intersubband transition in infrared region , we consider such transition in the ultraviolet or visible region , in which it has very large dipole moment length , so the optoelectonics devices may be realized with relatively smaller pulse intensity .",
    "besides , devices based on semiconductor qw structures have many inherent advantages , such as large electric dipole moments due to the small effective electron mass , high nonlinear optical coefficients , and a great flexibility in device design by choosing the materials and structure dimensions .",
