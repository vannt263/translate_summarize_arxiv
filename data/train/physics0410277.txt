    "the large ion collider experiment alice @xcite is intended to study heavy - ion collisions at the energy of 5.5 tev per nucleon at the lhc collider . for photons detection alice",
    "is equipped by the photon spectrometer ( phos ) @xcite which is a high - granularity electromagnetic calorimeter built of lead - tungstate crystals ( pbwo@xmath1 ) with the transverse dimension of @xmath2 @xmath3 and the length of 18  cm .",
    "the phos detector consists of five modules , each made as a matrix of @xmath4 crystals located at 460  cm from the beams interaction point .",
    "the spectrometer is positioned at the bottom of the alice set - up covering @xmath5 in pseudorapidity and 100@xmath6 in the azimuthal angle .",
    "the alice set - up is rather transparent to @xmath7-radiation . to reach phos ,",
    "the produced photons pass through the inner tracking system ( its ) @xcite , the time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite and the charge particle veto detector ( cpv ) @xcite .",
    "the stratum of medium takes @xmath8 of the radiation length @xcite ( with the main contribution from its and tpc ) , which gives a small probability of the secondary photon production in the medium .",
    "one of the tasks of the alice experiment is to detect direct photons carrying the information about fundamental processes at extreme conditions of the quark matter .",
    "the energy range of such photons extends from 0.4 gev to 10 gev for thermal radiation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) and higher , up to hundreds gev , for radiation occurring also in early collisions of the constituents . in the latter case",
    "the essential background is arising from the two - photon decay of @xmath0-mesons , produced at the same energies as photons , due to the merge of decay photons into one shower in phos .",
    "contribution of the photonic decay from heavier meson resonances ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc . ) exists as well .",
    "such photons provide a rather heavy background to direct photon production over the whole @xmath12 range and they should be subtracted from the data .",
    "it leads to the necessity of identifying the phos showers as those produced by the photons or @xmath0-mesons .",
    "the straightforward way to discriminate the considered background from direct photons is to exploit a powerful reconstruction program tuned especially for the given phos structure and able to resolve the fine problem of the `` direct '' photon selection ( say , by the maximum likelihood method ) , and correspondingly , to find the real number of the showers even in the overlapped clusters . to accomplish this task",
    ", a program should correctly take into account the shower profiles of photons and charged particles at different incident angles , as well as their fluctuations , the electronics noise , the threshold on registered signals ( that increases the number of zero channels in the selected cluster ) , etc .",
    "in practice such a perfect program is often too complicated for fast realization with long tuning and commissioning and additionally needs essential computational resources .",
    "therefore , real reconstruction programs are usually created in some simplification assumptions which results in the degradation of its discrimination power for direct photon selection .",
    "such simplified programs are often based on the recognition of the shapes of the showers produced by different kinds of particles .    in this paper",
    "we apply the artificial neural - network ( ann ) approach @xcite for the direct photon identification in phos .",
    "the ann - method has already recommended itself as a powerful tool in different applications of high energy physics , e.g. quark and gluon jet separation , b - quark identification , higgs boson search , selection of the rare neutral meson decay modes violating @xmath13-parity , etc . @xcite .",
    "the main peculiarity of our method is the use of the energy - profile tensor of a cluster , which components are calculated in its eigen - vector coordinate system , with the aims of the neural net training and the afterward event classification .",
    "our calculations show essential recognition capacities of this procedure that were examined using a sample of monte - carlo generated events simulating the isolating production of direct photons and @xmath0-mesons for the real alice set - up .",
    "in the analysis of experimental data , a standard procedure of selecting signal events is based on various cuts of observed kinematics variables .",
    "a general case of such cuts corresponds to a particular set of functions , called feature functions or neurons . in general terms ,",
    "neural networks are represented as a large number of interconnected functional units named nodes with a neuron in each of them .",
    "the data processing is organized in the most common , to - date , architecture called the multilayer perception ( mlp ) .",
    "mlp incorporates one input layer through which the initial data ( features ) are injected , several hidden layers , and one output layer of neurons .",
    "output response @xmath14 of the @xmath15-th neuron is obtained by the so called sigmoid function @xmath16 @xmath17 dependent on the weighted sum of all input signals @xmath18 to this neuron : @xmath19 where index @xmath20 runs over all the inputs of the @xmath15-th node , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the weights and the correspondent thresholds optimizing the selecting power of the procedure .",
    "function @xmath16 is defined as @xmath23 the output layer , consisting of one node , provides a neural - net response @xmath24 , wedged between 0 and 1 , and used to classify the events .",
    "the use of the neural network is a two - step process , i.e. a learning stage followed by an application stage . during the learning phase using the monte - carlo simulation , we know about every event whether it is a background or a signal one .",
    "the optimal values of weights @xmath21 and thresholds @xmath22 , ( see ( [ oi ] ) ) , for resolving the problem are determined by minimizing the functional @xmath25 @xmath26 where index @xmath27 runs over all @xmath28 training events , @xmath29 for the background and @xmath30 for desired events , @xmath31 are the ann response .",
    "the details of the whole minimization procedure can be found in @xcite . and finally the quality of learning is tested with an independent sample of monte - carlo events .",
    "reconstruction programs for cellular electromagnetic calorimeters provide data as a set of clusters defined as a group of cells with a common edge .",
    "every cluster is characterized by the amplitudes of signals from the cells and coordinates of the cluster cells on the detector plane .",
    "the total length of the data array for one cluster is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a number of cells in the cluster .",
    "this array contains exhausting experimental information about the cluster but , however , it is not convenient for the aim of the ann approach , at least due to the varying data length from event to event . to overcome the latter problem one can use only the limited number of major cluster cells ( say , @xmath34 around the cell with the maximal amplitude @xcite ) , but it definitely leads to the uncontrolled information loss .    the essential part of our ann - approach to @xmath35 selection is to choose such a fixed number of variables that carry , nevertheless , the principal part of information with its volume big enough to find a solution and which length is independent of the cluster size .",
    "first of all each cluster is characterized by a position of its center - of - gravity @xmath36 as well as by the center of the cell with the maximal signal in the cluster @xmath37 .",
    "vector @xmath36 is defined according to the standard formula @xmath38 where index @xmath27 runs over all cluster cells , @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the coordinates of the @xmath27-th cluster cell in an arbitrary coordinate system .",
    "then we introduce an energy - profile tensor @xmath41 of a cluster ( that can be also interpreted as a @xmath42 matrix ) calculated in the local cluster coordinate system .",
    "there are two natural possibilities to set the origin of this coordinate system : either in the center of gravity @xmath36 or in the center of the cell with the maximal signal in the cluster @xmath37 . in our calculations",
    "we choose the latter option .",
    "after that @xmath41 is defined as @xmath43 here index @xmath27 runs over all the cluster cells , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are coordinates of the @xmath27-th cluster cell , for definition , in non - dimensional units of the crystal transverse size , and @xmath44 is the energy detected in this cell .",
    "tensor ( [ q ] ) is a quadratic positive - definite form .",
    "the introduced tensor ( [ q ] ) reflects the cluster energy profile which depends on the number of showers overlapped in one cluster , as well as on inclination of the photon incidence on the detector . to avoid the latter effect or , at any rate , to decrease it",
    "we have made ( before calculating matrix @xmath41 ) a compression of the cluster space relative to the origin of the local cluster coordinate system @xmath45 along the vector directed from the geometrical center of the phos module to the point @xmath46 .",
    "the compression coefficient has been defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the angle between the perpendicular to the phos module surface and the photon propagation direction .",
    "the coordinate transformation due to the compression operation has been made according to the formula @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the vector of coordinates of an arbitrary transfered point , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the matrices of rotation and compression , respectively : @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the polar angle of the point @xmath46 in the polar coordinate system with its origin in the geometrical center of the phos module",
    ".    one can calculate two eigen values @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( ordered as @xmath57 ) of @xmath41 and find the correspondent eigen vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( normalized to a unit ) , defining a new coordinate system , where @xmath41 is reduced to the diagonal form . in this new system",
    "we also define moments @xmath60 : @xmath61 where index @xmath27 runs over the cluster cells , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the coordinates of the @xmath27-th cluster cell in the new coordinate system .",
    "note that @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the total cluster energy .",
    "such important magnitudes as distance @xmath67 between hits of two glued photons and their effective mass @xmath68 can also be expressed through @xmath60 ( see addendum ) .",
    "we would also like to point out an essential remark .",
    "initially the experimental information was carried by signal amplitudes and cell coordinates , and now it is represented by the introduced moments @xmath60 .",
    "we shall construct from @xmath60 the input vector @xmath69 of event features for ann .",
    "one additional angle variable , not directly expressed through the @xmath60 , can be added .",
    "this is angle @xmath70 between the eigen vector @xmath58 and vector @xmath46 directed from the geometrical center of the phos module to the cluster center @xmath71 the use of this angle , together with the coordinates of the cluster center on the detector plane , significantly improves the quality of @xmath35-selection mainly in the peripheral region of the phos modules .",
    "we have found that there are different sets of variables that allow to construct effective event feature vectors .",
    "they include the total detected cluster energy , the eigen values @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the moments @xmath60 , the estimation of the effective mass @xmath68 and distance @xmath67 between @xmath72-hits expressed through @xmath60 ( see formulas ( [ solution1 ] ) and ( [ mef_for ] ) ) , and the angle variable @xmath70 .",
    "coordinates of the cluster center @xmath46 relative to the center of the phos module can also be added , which increases the selection power of the method .      in this section",
    "the algorithm of the @xmath35-selection is discussed in detail .",
    "first of all we note , that at low energies there is a background from @xmath0 decays producing two separated clusters in phos that can be taken into account by one of the statistical methods , based on a good resolution of phos for @xmath68-effective masses in this case , which is demonstrated below in fig.[mef_fig]b .",
    "the mentioned procedures can , for example , reject the @xmath0-contribution by calculating the masses of @xmath72-combinations and by comparing them with the @xmath0-mass .",
    "it is possible to reduce the number of such combinations at high occupancy of the detector by taking into account the characteristic angle of the decay cone for photons .",
    "these methods are beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "thus , further calculations were fulfilled following the assumption that this type of backgrounds had been eliminated correctly .",
    "besides , there are two other essential sources of the background due to @xmath0-decays , when only one cluster appears in phos .",
    "the first one results from the detector geometry , i.e. when one of the decay photons from @xmath0 escapes detection in phos due to the limited acceptance , whereas the second photon hits phos and generates a single shower and therefore a single cluster .",
    "it provides actually indistinguishable from the direct photons sample of the background photons in the whole photon energy range .",
    "this background is essential at relatively small energies of neutral pions . to suppress the relative part @xmath73 ( close to one ) of such a background",
    ", we demand that the cone with a specially defined total angle @xmath74 around the photon propagation should cross the detector plane inside of it . the angle @xmath74 can be easily estimated from the isotropy of @xmath75 decay in the meson rest frame after the lorentz boost to the laboratory system @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy of the analyzed cluster , @xmath78 is the @xmath0-meson velocity in units of the light speed . note that minimal decay cone angle @xmath79 can be obtained from formula ( [ theta_cone ] ) at @xmath80 . in the case when both photons fly towards the detector direction we arrive at @xmath81 .",
    "to apply the considered cut we take @xmath82 .",
    "this cut actually works at small energies , and mainly at the edges of the calorimeter , while at high energies practically all events pass it successfully .",
    "the second background comes from the limited spatial resolution of phos , i.e. when the overlapping showers from two - photon decays of the high - energy pions form one cluster .",
    "this mechanism provides the major background for direct photons at high energies .",
    "its suppression is mainly fulfilled by the ann - algorithm .",
    "the step sequence runs as follows .",
    "first we apply the procedure of the local peak number determination in a cluster .",
    "it classifies the cluster as that with two overlapping showers when two local peaks are observed above the electronic noise fluctuations .",
    "such classification of clusters is a common algorithm in reconstruction programs for cellular detectors .    to decrease the background from the decays @xmath75 , when only one photon hits phos due to the limited aperture , we apply cut ( [ theta_cone ] ) with the use of @xmath74 .",
    "the remaining clusters with one peak passing this 2-stage preselection are analyzed by ann .",
    "it was composed of three layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ann ] ) :    input , hidden and output .",
    "the input layer consists of @xmath28 nodes , where @xmath28 is the dimension of vector @xmath69 representing the event features ; the hidden layer is built of @xmath83 nodes ; and finally , the one - node output layer provides the neural - net response @xmath84 .",
    "the net was trained with two samples of events containing the desired signals ( i.e. clusters from direct photons ) and the background ( i.e. clusters produced by the overlapped photons from decay @xmath85 ) .",
    "each sample consisted of 30,000 events ( clusters ) left after preselection .",
    "upon training the net , we tested its efficiency on another statistically independent signal and background samples , each consisting of 30,000 events also left after the preselection .",
    "the data taken for the analysis were simulated within the alice framework for the simulation , reconstruction and data analysis , aliroot v.3.06.02 @xcite .",
    "two samples of events were generated , one sample containing one photon and another sample having one @xmath0 per event .",
    "photons and @xmath0 s were emitted from the interaction point with the uniformly distributed transverse momentum in the range of @xmath86  gev / c within the solid angle defined by the uniformly distributed azimuth angle @xmath87 and the polar angle @xmath88 .",
    "the solid angle of the emitted particles was chosen to be a little larger that that of phos detector , to avoid various border effects .",
    "the decay of @xmath0 s was performed by the aliroot .",
    "the real alice environment was taken into account during the particle tracking from the interaction point to phos .",
    "the following detectors and infrastructure modules which cover the phos aperture were installed : pipe , its , tpc , trd , frame , as shown in fig.[fig : alice ] .",
    "this environment results in particle interactions with the media and the production of secondary particles which deteriorate the response of the phos detector .",
    "the response of the phos calorimeter was simulated by geant 3.21 @xcite , which was included into the aliroot package as a particle tracking and physics interaction tool .",
    "the showers developed by the particles passing through the calorimeter cells , gave the hits which were the deposited energy of the shower in each cell .",
    "these hits were digitized , i.e. the energy amplitude of the cell was measured by the two - channel adc , and the integer signal of the adc produced digits .",
    "the noise with @xmath89 mev was applied to the digits , after which the digits were passed through the 50-mev threshold cut .",
    "the remaining digits with a common side were grouped into clusters .",
    "only clusters with the total energy greater than 500 mev were accepted .",
    "the data that passed to the neural network analysis contained the following information .",
    "the event samples ( photons or @xmath0 s ) were identified by the file name .",
    "events had a header which was characterized by the event number , the energy of the produced particle and the number of the found clusters .",
    "the event header was followed by the cluster data consisting of the cluster header with the cluster number and the number of cells in the cluster , and the cell information containing the list of cell positions in phos as well as the cell amplitudes .",
    "analysis of the generated data shows that only 0.04% of direct photons are reconstructed as two - cluster events .",
    "the energies of the additional clusters are limited , they are practically not greater than 1.5 gev .    - and @xmath56 distributions for direct photons ( solid lines ) and background ( dotted lines ) . ]",

    "there are well observed peaks at the value of @xmath91-mass while application of the same formula ( [ mef_for ] ) for direct photons gives a smoothly falling dependence with the growth of mass in the region of the @xmath91-meson .",
    "smooth solid curves in the figure show the results of gaussian fits of @xmath0-peaks .",
    "the average value and variation for the separated clusters are equal to 133 mev and 6.8 mev , respectively .",

    "the rise of the @xmath0 misidentification probability at energies below 25  gev is caused by the @xmath101 decays with one photon outside phos , whereas the decrease of the true photon identification efficiency at the energies below @xmath102  gev is the result of the true photon cut decreasing the background from these decays of @xmath0 s with only one photon inside phos .",
    "we compare our results with the data of work @xcite where the coefficient @xmath94 was estimated for the star experiment as 0.15 at 20 gev and 0.45 at 40 gev at fixed @xmath103 .",

    "the obtained values @xmath94 varied from 0.25 to 0.55 at @xmath104  gev and from 0.40 to 0.55 at @xmath105 gev , dependent on the rapidity range , while the efficiency of the single photon recognition was kept at 91% .",
    "in this paper a neural network method is developed to separate the direct photons from the neutral pion background in the phos spectrometer of the alice experiment .",
