    "there exist two remarkable results about periodic billiard trajectories inside ellipsoids : the _ generalized poncelet theorem _ and the _ generalized cayley conditions_.    a classical geometric theorem of poncelet  @xcite implies that if a billiard trajectory inside an ellipse is periodic , then all the trajectories sharing its caustic are also periodic .",

    "what caustics do give rise to periodic trajectories ?",
    "the planar case was solved by cayley  @xcite in the xix century .",

    "generalized cayley conditions _ for billiards inside ellipsoids fifteen years ago .",
    "they have also stated similar conditions in other billiard frameworks ; see  @xcite .    for simplicity ,",

    "let @xmath5 be the triaxial ellipsoid with ellipsoidal parameters @xmath6 .",
    "any billiard trajectory inside @xmath7 has as caustics two elements of the family of confocal quadrics @xmath8 we restrict our attention to nonsingular trajectories .",
    "that is , trajectories with two different caustics which are ellipsoids : @xmath9 , hyperboloids of one sheet : @xmath10 , or hyperboloids of two sheets : @xmath11 .",
    "the singular values @xmath12 are discarded .",
    "there exist some restrictions on the caustics @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is known that eh1 , h1h1 , eh2 , and h1h2 are the only feasible caustic types ; see  @xcite .",
    "the meaning of these notations is evident .",
    "the generalized cayley condition in this context can be expressed as follows .",
    "the billiard trajectories inside the triaxial ellipsoid @xmath7 sharing the caustics @xmath13 and @xmath14 are periodic with _",
    "elliptic period _",
    "@xmath15 if and only if @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we claim that most results related to generalized cayley conditions become simpler when expressed in terms of the inverse quantities @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "proposition  [ pro : c_n_n ] is a paradigmatic example .",
    "the elliptic period is defined in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "roughly speaking , the difference between the period @xmath3 and the elliptic period @xmath23 of the periodic billiard trajectories sharing two given caustics is that _ all _ those trajectories close in cartesian ( respectively , elliptic ) coordinates after exactly @xmath3 ( respectively , @xmath23 ) bounces .",
    "we will see that either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the previous matrix formulation is very nice from a theoretical point of view , but it has strong limitations from a computational point of view .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : practical ] that it can be written as a system of two homogeneous symmetric polynomial equations with rational coefficients of degrees @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , both degrees grow _ quadratically _ with the elliptic period @xmath23 , which turns this approach into a tough challenge . in particular , to our knowledge , the caustic parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 have never been explicitly expressed in terms of the ellipsoidal parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for any @xmath15 .",
    "we will rewrite this matrix formulation as a computationally more appealing one which gives rise to ( non - symmetric ) homogeneous polynomial equations whose degrees are smaller than the elliptic period @xmath23 .",
    "we will find the following remarkable algebraic relations between caustic and ellipsoidal parameters using the new formulation .",
    "the billiard trajectories inside the ellipsoid @xmath7 sharing the caustics @xmath13 and @xmath14 are periodic with :    * elliptic period @xmath33 if the roots of @xmath34 are the caustic parameters ; * elliptic period @xmath35 if there exists @xmath36 such that the roots of @xmath37 are the ellipsoidal parameters ; and * elliptic period @xmath38 if the roots of @xmath39 are double ones .",
    "let us compare both formulations in the third case .",
    "on the one hand , the two homogeneous symmetric polynomial equations obtained from the matrix formulation have degrees 23 and 24 in the variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . on the other hand",

    ", we find just a _ subset _ of such trajectories using the polynomial @xmath39 .",
    "another natural question about periodic billiard trajectories is the following one . which are the triaxial ellipsoids of @xmath40 that display periodic billiard trajectories with a fixed caustic type and a fixed ( elliptic ) period ?",
    "a numerical approach to that question was considered in  @xcite , where the authors computed several bifurcations in the space of ellipsoidal parameters .",
    "we will find the algebraic relations that define the bifurcations associated to small elliptic periods .",
    "for instance , we will see that there exist periodic billiard trajectories with elliptic period @xmath41 and caustic type eh1 if and only if @xmath42 .    for brevity",
    ", we will not depict billiard trajectories inside triaxial ellipsoids of @xmath40 .",
    "the reader interested in 3d graphical visualizations is referred to  @xcite , where several periodic billiard trajectories with small periods are displayed from different perspectives .",
    "we complete this introduction with a note on the organization of the article . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we review briefly some well - known results about billiards inside ellipsoids , recalling the matrix formulation of the generalized cayley conditions obtained by dragovi and radnovi .",
    "we also introduce the concept of elliptic period . the practical limitations of the matrix formulation are exposed in section  [ sec : practical ] .",
    "next , we present the polynomial formulation in section  [ sec : polynomial ] . in section  [ sec : minimal ] we carry out a detailed analysis for minimal elliptic periods , whereas the study of more general elliptic periods is postponed to section  [ sec : general ] .",

    "in this section we recall several classical results and their modern generalizations about billiards inside ellipsoids that go back to jacobi , chasles , poncelet , darboux , and cayley .",
    "we consider the billiard dynamics inside the ellipsoid @xmath44 the degenerate cases in which the ellipsoid has some symmetry of revolution are not considered here .",
    "this ellipsoid is an element of the family of confocal quadrics @xmath45 we note that @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "thus , there are exactly @xmath48 different geometric types of nonsingular quadrics in this family , which correspond to the cases @xmath49 for instance , the confocal quadric @xmath50 is an ellipsoid if and only if @xmath51 . on the other hand , the meaning of @xmath50 in the singular cases",
