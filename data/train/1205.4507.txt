    "introduced in 1966 by a.  eringnen ( see @xcite ) , micropolar equations became an important generalization of the classical navier - stokes model .",
    "these equations take into account that fluid molecules may rotate independently of the fluid rotation .",
    "thus , the standard navier - stokes system is complemented with another vector equation which describes the angular momentum of the particles .",
    "if we denote the velocity field by @xmath2 and the microrotation fields by @xmath3 , then we see that @xmath4 has six degrees of freedom .",
    "let us clearly emphasize that @xmath3 does not represent the rotation field @xmath5 derived from the velocity field ( @xmath2 ) and in most cases these vector fields differ fundamentally from each other .",
    "this phenomenon gains an immense significance for modelling some well - known fluids , e.g. animal blood or liquid crystals ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the microscale , when at least one dimension of the domain is only a few times larger than the size of the molecules ( e.g. blood vessels , lubricants ) , fluid motions even for isotropic fluid can differ substantially from what would follow from the computations based entirely on the navier - stokes equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior is caused by the dominance of the surface stresses over body forces . although not all the aspects of physical experiments have been fully explained but it is justified to assume that the surface stresses and the internal degrees of freedom of particles are the deciding factors for properties of fluid motion .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that apart from a. eringen , other mathematicians and physicists have proposed numerous generalizations of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the comparison of these theories can be found in @xcite . for a short historical review",
    "we refer the reader to ( * ? ? ?",

    ".    in this work we plan to investigate the global existence of strong solutions to micropolar equations which are given by @xmath6 the unknowns are : the velocity field @xmath2 , the pressure @xmath7 and the microroation field @xmath3 .",
    "the viscosity coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are fixed and positive .",
    "note that if @xmath9 then @xmath12 and @xmath13 get uncoupled .",
    "therefore we can not expect better results than for the classical navier - stokes equations .",
    "so far we have not specified the domain @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that is has a product form @xmath15 where the constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 are positive and @xmath18 is a @xmath19-closed curve in @xmath20 .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is a finite cylinder placed alongside the @xmath1-axis ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .     and its boundary @xmath21 . ]    from practical point of view ( blood vessels , lubrication theory )",
    "our choice is justified . from theoretical perspective , our approach is intensely focused upon search for such solutions that are close to two dimensional ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the solutions which are proved to exist , can be regarded as a slight perturbation of two dimensional flow along the perpendicular direction .",
    "this perturbation will be somehow measured by @xmath22 ( see ) , which we introduce later .",
    "we shall emphasize that since we only require the initial rate of change of the flow and microrotation , as well as the derivatives of the external data with respect to @xmath1 to be small , the flow alongside the cylinder can be large , but close to constant .",
    "as far as the boundary condition are concerned , we use @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the unit outward vector .",
    "the first two equations may be interpreted as tangential `` slip '' velocity being proportional to tangential stress with a factor of proportionality depending only on the curvature of @xmath18 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . such boundary condition was already postulated in 1827 by c.m.l.h .",
    "the third equation is clear but from the physical point view not necessarily adequate because the molecules may not move but they can rotate ( see @xcite ) . this effect is regarded in the fourth equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "before we present the main result of this work , we should employ some notation . by @xmath25",
    "we denote @xmath26 where @xmath27 . a generic constant @xmath28 may change from line to line and is subscripted with appropriate symbol which indicates the dependence on the domain ( @xmath29 ) , embedding theorems ( @xmath30 ) , the poincar inequality ( @xmath31 ) and viscosity coefficients ( @xmath32 ) . to simplify the formulas we will also use @xmath33    to shorten energy estimate we introduce @xmath34 finally",
    ", the function @xmath35 will be of particular interest .",

    "we have assumed an exponential decay with respect to time on the external data and their derivative along the axis of the cylinder .",
    "the reason underlying this assumption follows from the necessity to control the amount of the energy supplied to the system .",
    "if we consider the global in time existence , the supplied energy must be balanced by the rate of its lost due to friction , otherwise the system blows - up .",

    "however , it is beyond the scope of our study . for further reading",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    note also , that if we had the poincar inequality for @xmath201 and @xmath202 with respect to @xmath1 , we would be able to relax the assumption on the exponential decay of the external data and limit our considerations only to their rate of change .        by application of lemma [ l1 ]",

    "the first integral contains second - order derivatives of @xmath3 , which makes it impossible to estimate by the data in any suitable norm . for the second we apply trace theorem and interpolation inequality , which we shall present later .",
    "for now we only write @xmath219 finally , we rewrite in the following form @xmath220 we shall estimate @xmath221 by application of the hlder and the young inequalities .",
    "two first one is obvious : @xmath222 for @xmath223 more work is required . from the trace theorem",
    "it follows that for @xmath224 @xmath225 now we use an inequality of gagliardo - nirenberg type ( see ( * ? ? ?",
