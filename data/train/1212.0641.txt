    "we will not constrain ourselves to these particular values of @xmath30 , however , and will scale @xmath124 and @xmath125 appropriately . in passing ,",
    "we note that @xmath9 and @xmath12 can be made larger by decreasing the length of the cavity or lowering the mechanical oscillation frequencies .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 can be increased by lowering the effective mass of the moving mirror , while @xmath12 by using a sphere with a larger refractive index or a cavity with a smaller waist .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath125 can be made larger by increasing the ratios @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we have already mentioned how @xmath128 gives rise to the steady - state solution @xmath129  @xcite . in the linearised regime , the motion of the sphere is thus decoupled from that of the dynamics of the cavity  mirror system .",
    "this can easily be seen by substituting @xmath128 and @xmath129 into the drift matrix @xmath83 .",
    "a straightforward method to explore the implications of the coupling induced by our interaction hamiltonian is thus to look at cooling of the motion of the sphere . a sample of such data is shown in fig .  [ fig : occupation ] .",
    "the cases ( i )  @xmath130 or ( ii )  @xmath131 have been excluded from the plot for reasons that will be clarified later on .",
    "we see that , for each @xmath132 , there exists a band of frequencies @xmath90 for which the steady - state occupation for the spherical motion is significantly below the starting value . moreover , for a particular @xmath133 that depends most strongly on the properties of the mirror ( in particular , the constant parameter @xmath134 ) , the motion of the mirror and sphere equilibrate to the same occupation number .",
    "the data displayed in fig .  [ fig : occupation ] show the reduction of the occupation number of the sphere by almost three orders of magnitude .",
    "however , in our numerical exploration we have seen evidence that this is not an upper limit to the efficiency of the process . indeed , decreasing the temperature of the thermal bath to which the mirror is coupled will yield a correspondingly lower occupation number for the sphere , as a result of dynamical equilibration of the sphere through the mechanical mirror .",
    "the basic mechanism through which this cooling process occurs is a hybridisation of the motion of the two oscillators . for moderately large values of @xmath135 , increasing the input power from zero causes the frequencies of the normal modes of the system , given by the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of @xmath83 , to shift .",
    "thus , for instance , the mode that at @xmath136 describes the mirror motion shifts to a smaller frequency @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "at the point where @xmath138 , the two modes hybridise and cooling ensues .",
    "for @xmath139 , this hybridisation is no longer possible .",
    "however , if @xmath135 is too large , the system reaches instability before the criterion @xmath138 can be satisfied .",
    "conversely , if @xmath135 is not large enough , the power at which @xmath138 is satisfied is too low for efficient cooling .",
    "such hybridisation can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequenciesoccupations ] , where we plot the case @xmath89 , at the optimal values for @xmath90 and @xmath85 .    another unique feature of our system is that , after cooling the sphere , we can switch to coupling light into the cavity from the moving mirror .",
    "as explained in appendix  [ app : geometries ] , this means that the hamiltonian that couples the motion of the sphere to the optical field is purely quadratic .",
    "this renders possible , for example , quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements of the energy of the harmonic oscillator embodied by the sphere .",
    "this protocol requires that the cavity can be pumped from either end - mirror , but is deterministic and otherwise less demanding than , e.g. , measurement - based schemes for achieving the same  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of mechanical elements to a light field , both linearly  @xcite and quadratically  @xcite , can give rise to squeezing of the mechanical motion , where the quantum nature of the optomechanical interaction acts to suppress the noise in one of the quadratures of the mechanical motion . to investigate the occurrence of mechanical squeezing in our setup we set the temperature of the baths coupled to both oscillators to zero .",
    "for the parameters given above , there is no observable squeezing in the motion of the sphere , and to induce such effects we have found it necessary to use a larger value for @xmath12 , e.g. , two orders of magnitude larger in the case of the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezing ] .    to quantify the amount of squeezing in the steady state of the linearised dynamics , we used the figure of merit @xmath140 as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezing](b ) for @xmath32 . in other words , @xmath141 only when the variance of one of the quadratures dips below the @xmath142-quantum level that is due to vacuum fluctuations in the ground state .",
    "we find a maximal @xmath143db ( @xmath144 ) just before the instability threshold , which compares favourably to the amount of squeezing obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for pure quadratic coupling .",
    "+ we conclude this section by noting that the larger quadratic coupling strengths necessary for generating and observing squeezing can be obtained by making use of avoided crossings between pairs of cavity modes  @xcite .",
    "we have explored a system consisting of an optomechanical cavity with an additional intra - cavity particle whose motion is coupled quadratically to the cavity field . a direct coupling between the two moving elements arises naturally in this system .",
    "this coupling can be turned off and on at will by choosing which port the cavity is driven from , and therefore provides complete control over whether the interaction with the particle is purely quadratic , or whether it has some linear character . as examples of the potential of our scheme ,",
    "we have discussed the possibility of cooling the motion of the sphere , despite its nominal quadratic coupling , as well as squeezing of this same motion .",
    "our work opens up interesting perspectives for quantum state - transfer between two oscillators and the distribution of multipartite entanglement .",
    "moreover , the system that we have addressed leaves room for asking interesting questions on the nonlocal nature of the three - mode state achieved via the coupling mechanisms addressed here , a goal that can be pursued , for instance , through the formal apparatus recently put forward in ref .  @xcite .",

    "parts of the calculations were carried out using computational facilities funded by the european regional development fund , project erdf-080 .",
    "the function of this appendix is to elucidate the differences between pumping the cavity from the immobile mirror , from the moving mirror , or from both ends .",

    "[ fig : geometries](c ) , however , the nodes of the field do not shift when the mirror moves , such that there is no longer any cross - coupling between the two oscillators .",
    "the case of a _ resonant _ cavity pumped from one end is special :  since all the input light is transmitted and none is reflected off the cavity , both mirrors effectively interact with three running waves of nonzero amplitude , two moving away from the pump , one towards it , such that the right mirror is a time - reversed copy of the left mirror .",
    "the entire system is therefore invariant under inversion of coordinates and time reversal .    in our notation ,",
    "the part of the interaction hamiltonian that involves the sphere can be represented as @xmath145 with reference to the respective cases in fig .",

    "<S> as we shall show , this system allows us to exert a degree of control on the state of the motion of the sphere through its indirect interaction with the end - mirror , mediated by the cavity field . as a result of this , and by means of a judicious choice of operating parameters , we will show that passive cooling of the motion of the sphere , despite its apparent quadratic coupling to the cavity field , and squeezing of this same motion are both possible . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we expect that the interaction between the cavity field , sphere , and end - mirror gives rise to steady states with interesting genuinely tripartite entangled  @xcite or nonlocal  @xcite properties .    </S>",
    "<S> one might think that the hamiltonian that describes this compound system would simply be given by the sum of the interaction terms in @xmath13 through the position @xmath14 of the end - mirror and @xmath15 through the position @xmath16 of the sphere . as natural as this might seem , this would not be entirely correct , given that the position of the end - mirror not only defines the resonance frequency of the cavity ( as captured through the interaction in @xmath13 ) , but also determines the relative position of the cavity field ( anti)nodes and the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , for the configuration shown in  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model ] , i.e. , for a cavity pumped from the leftmost ( fixed ) mirror , the light field couples quadratically to the relative position operator @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus write the hamiltonian @xmath18\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}\\,,\\ ] ] where the subscript ` lp ' reminds us that the system is pumped from the left . in appendix  [ app : geometries ] , we examine the other possibilities for the geometry of the pump field .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : eom ] will set the stage for exploring the dynamics of our system , deriving in particular the hamiltonian and the linearised equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : cooling ] subsequently makes use of numerical simulations to discuss the resulting dynamics . as an application of our scheme </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the cross - coupling between the two oscillators , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : hlp ] ) , gives rise to efficient cooling of the mechanical motion of the sphere . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : squeezing ] we discuss squeezing of the motion of the sphere and demonstrate that this motion can be squeezed appreciably if the coupling constant @xmath12 is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we conclude with an outlook of possible future directions . </S>"
