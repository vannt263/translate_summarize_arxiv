    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is liable to corrections if the electromagnetic environment of the system under consideration is different from free space .",
    "for example , the lamb shift in an atom changes if the atom is located not in free space but near a reflecting surface @xcite .",
    "this and similar boundary - dependent effects are the subject of cavity qed @xcite . under most circumstances cavity",
    "qed effects are non - relativistic in nature and hence the techniques employed in the theory of cavity qed are chiefly non - relativistic .",
    "they rely mostly on a comparatively simple mode expansion of the electromagnetic field and on first - quantized theory for the remaining part of the system under investigation ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) . however , there are a few examples of systems that are not inherently non - relativistic , the simplest being a free electron . by virtue of being free",
    "it lacks an in - built energy scale that could limit its virtual excitations and thus its interactions with the electromagnetic field to non - relativistic energies .",
    "other effects that require a fully second - quantized theory are , e.g. , radiative corrections to the casimir force between reflecting planes @xcite and the scharnhorst effect of faster - than-@xmath0 light propagation inbetween and perpendicular to parallel plates @xcite . to date all such field - theoretical calculations have been done for cavity walls that are perfectly reflecting . while it is obvious that no real material can ever really be perfectly reflecting , the model of perfect reflectivity seems to capture all the essential physics of the boundary without going wrong by anything other than a minor numerical prefactor .",
    "its great attraction is that it is comparatively simple ; for example , the photon propagator between two parallel perfectly reflecting plates can be written as a sum of the photon propagator in free space and a small boundary - dependent correction , and loop calculations using it are manageable , though not trivial because of the loss of translation invariance perpendicular to the plates @xcite .    however , we recently discovered that the assumption of perfect reflectivity for the cavity walls is in fact not justified for systems , such as a free electron , that admit low - frequency excitations , i.e. whose excitation spectrum has , unlike an atom s , no natural ir cutoff @xcite .",
    "this is because , crudely speaking , the electron s virtual excitations of arbitrarily long wavelengths interact with evanescent electromagnetic field modes originating inside a cavity wall , and the chief defect of the perfect - reflector model is that it ignores all such evanescent modes . to show this we have modelled",
    "an imperfect reflector by a non - dispersive dielectric and have calculated the self - energy of an electron in front of a dielectric half - space .",
    "we have found that taking the limit of perfect reflectivity in the result disagrees with the corresponding calculation that assumes a perfectly reflecting wall from the outset .",
    "the two results differ by a factor of 2 in one direction and even by sign in the other .",
    "while the effect as such can already be seen in a non - relativistic calculation , we felt that there was a need for a proper second - quantized calculation , mainly for three reasons : _",
    "( i ) _ the non - relativistic calculation yields different results for the two models but gives no clue as to the origin of this discrepancy ; _ ( ii ) _ there is nothing that _ a priori _ restricts the electron s motion to non - relativistic energy scales and , in fact , the interaction energy is being integrated up to infinity , which could potentially lead to errors that pass by unnoticed in a purely non - relativistic calculation ; and _ ( iii ) _ there are other effects , as e.g. the boundary - dependent @xmath1 correction to the electron s anomalous magnetic moment , which might be affected and whose calculation requires field - theoretical methods .",
    "furthermore , in the face of a major discrepancy it seems wise to check all possibilities .    in this paper we establish the major building blocks of a full qed theory near imperfect reflectors .",
    "we concentrate on a non - dispersive and non - absorbing dielectric as a good model for an imperfectly reflecting material .",
    "thus the medium is characterized by a single parameter , its refractive index @xmath2 , which is real and the same for all frequencies . for technical simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to a single reflecting surface , i.e. we consider a dielectric half - space , which we take to occupy the region @xmath3 , while the region @xmath4 is vacuum ( cf .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "for this set - up the dielectric function is a single step function @xmath5 which makes the solution of maxwell s equations comparatively simple . for piecewise constant dielectric functions like this , it is advantageous gauge to work in the generalized coloumb gauge @xmath6 which we shall do in this paper . for a general coordinate",
    "dependent dielectric function @xmath7 the generalized coulomb gauge may be a very awkward choice , but for a piecewise constant @xmath7 this gauge is so convenient because anywhere except right on the boundary ( or boundaries ) of the dielectric ( @xmath8 in our case ) , it is equivalent to the coulomb gauge @xmath9",
    ". thus one can work almost as if in the coulomb gauge and just needs to make sure that the physical fields satisfy the appropriate matching conditions at the boundary , i.e.  that @xmath10 since our model material is just a dielectric and has a magnetic permeability @xmath11 , the magnetic fields strengths @xmath12 and @xmath13 are also continuous everywhere .",
    "we note that quantum mechanics in the generalized coulomb gauge is related to that in the true coulomb gauge by canonical transformation @xcite ; the two differ by surfaces charges leading to an electrostatic image potential in the hamiltonian .    if one wanted to work in a gauge that resembles the radiation gauge , one ought to choose the gauge @xmath14 in this gauge maxwell s equations for the scalar potential @xmath15 and the vector potential @xmath16 read @xmath17={\\bf j}\\ .",

    "we calculate the full photon propagator in the presence of a non - dispersive dielectric half - space starting from the normal modes of the radiation field which we briefly discuss in appendix [ sec : modes ] . in section [ sec : self ]",
    "we use this photon propagator to determine the self - energy of a free electron located outside and a distance @xmath18 away from the dielectric . in section",
    "[ sec : asympt ] we do a careful asymptotic analysis of the expression for the self - energy for non - relativistic mean energies . in section [ sec : ninf ] we compare the results for the electron s radiative self - energy in front of an imperfectly or of a perfectly reflecting surface and discuss the reasons for the disagreement between the calculation for a non - dispersive dielectric and for a `` perfect reflector '' .",
