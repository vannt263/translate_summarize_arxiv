    "the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) t - matrix appears not only in the description of the nn scattering process but constitutes a key ingredient of the three- and four - nucleon calculations ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "no wonder that many methods to calculate this quantity have been proposed and realized both in coordinate and in momentum space . for many years",
    "it has been natural to use the rotational invariance of the nn force and introduce a partial wave basis .",
    "this procedure has a clear physical meaning and is very accurate at low energies .",
    "however , at higher energies very many partial waves are necessary to achieve converged results , so methods employing vector variables might become more efficient .",
    "there have been several approaches to nn scattering avoiding partial wave decomposition ( pwd ) .",
    "pioneering calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite carried out for different malfliet - tjon - type potentials gave interesting numerical insight in the properties of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) t - matrix and paved the way for further investigations including spin degrees of freedom . a helicity formalism directly linked to the total nn spin",
    "was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "later , the spectator equation for relativistic nn scattering was solved in  @xcite also using a helicity formulation .",
    "closely related are 3d formulations for pion - nucleon scattering  @xcite and for scattering of protons on light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these developments were then used in few - body calculations . the faddeev equation for the system of three bosons interacting via scalar forces",
    "was solved for the bound state case  @xcite as well as for three - body scattering  @xcite directly in three dimensions .",

    "@xcite was employed in 3n calculations in  @xcite .",
    "recently we proposed a 3d framework for 3n bound  @xcite and 3n scattering states  @xcite , where spin - momentum operators are introduced and treated analytically so the faddeev equations turn into a finite set of coupled equations for scalar functions depending only on momentum vectors . for this formulation",
    "it is crucial that the most general form of the nn interaction can only depend on six linearly independent spin - momentum operators . in @xcite",
    "we formulated a new approach to nn scattering and provided its numerical realization based on the matrix inversion method .",
    "a comparison with the standard pwd calculations for two quite different nn potentials and a few projectile energies proved that the new scheme is very accurate @xcite .",
    "however , in view of expected applications to the 3n calculations , where we need the full off - shell t - matrix , we decided to develop a more efficient , iteration approach to calculate the 3d t - matrix .",
    "we also realized an old idea presented , for example , in @xcite and prepared a scheme for obtaining the on - shell t - matrix from the solution of the k - matrix equation .    in sect .",

    "the most general rotational , parity and time reversal invariant isospin projected nn force is then expanded into six scalar spin - momentum operators @xmath6 @xcite as @xmath7 using @xcite @xmath8 and scalar functions @xmath9 which depend only on the @xmath10 and @xmath11 momenta .",
    "a corresponding expansion into the @xmath12 operators can be applied to the nn t - operator at the 2n internal energy @xmath13 : @xmath14 the @xmath13 parameter appears in the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the free resolvent .    inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.3 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) into the ls equation ( [ eq:2.4 ] ) , operating with @xmath17 from the left and performing the trace in the nn spin space leads to @xmath18 the scalar coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 , defined as @xmath21 are given explicitly in appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    "we obtain a set of six coupled equations for the scalar functions @xmath22 , which depend , for fixed @xmath13 and @xmath23 , on two variables , @xmath24 and the cosine of the relative angle between the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath10 , given by @xmath25 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed all steps leading to the nn elastic scattering observables .",
    "the ls equation was solved there for positive energy of the nn system , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the nucleon mass .",
    "we chose the following representation for the vectors @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath31 and prepared grids for the different variables in the problem .",
    "we took @xmath32 gaussian points for the @xmath33 integration and used the same grid for the @xmath34 points .",
    "we employed @xmath35 gaussian points for the @xmath36 and @xmath37 grids , which are defined in the interval @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , @xmath39 is added to the set of @xmath36 points .",
    "the intermediate @xmath40 integration was performed with @xmath41 gaussian points .",

    "they always led , however , to stable and unique predictions for the observables . in ref .",
    "@xcite we worked with the standard lu decomposition of _ numerical recipes _ @xcite for two different nn forces ( the bonn b  @xcite potential and a chiral nnlo potential  @xcite ) and made calculations for several @xmath46 energies . for all considered cases we obtained a perfect agreement between this new 3d approach and the calculations based on standard partial wave methods .    solving eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6 ] ) directly as a system of inhomogeneous coupled algebraic equations is not efficient . especially in view of the applications in the three - nucleon system , where a full off - shell t - matrix is needed ,",
    "it is worth looking for a faster method .",
    "a typical job employing @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 gaussian points might take a few hours on a pc . in ref .",
    "@xcite we tried to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6 ] ) by iterations . in the matrix form",
    "this equation was written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) constituted the components of the @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) vector and @xmath55 with    & f_k ( p  ; p,p , x ) & + & m _ j ,",

    "( [ eq:2.6 ] ) was written as @xmath58 so we arrived at the following iteration scheme : @xmath59 we found it , however , very difficult to maintain numerical stability for this iterative method .",
    "fortunately , it turned out that our scheme could be easily modified to give stable results .",
    "it is sufficient to combine , on the level of _ analytical _ calculations , the @xmath60 and @xmath20 coefficients , preparing @xmath61 the new , numerically safe , iteration scheme reads thus : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and    & _ k ( p  ; p,p , x ) & + & m _ j , j=1 ^ 6 _ -1 ^ 1 d x  _ 0 ^ 2 d  _ kjj ( p , p  , p , x,x  ,  ) v_j ( p , p,y ) t _ j ( p  , p , x  ) . & [ ftilde ]    the above given iterative method proves also very fast .",
    "it is very important from the numerical point of view that the summation over @xmath64 and the integral over @xmath65 do not involve @xmath66 , which means that they can be prepared and stored in advance and later used in each iteration .",
    "furthermore , this scheme can be easily implemented on a parallel machine and used to calculate @xmath66 for many @xmath43 points at one shot . in the case ,",
    "when one is interested in the on - shell t - matrix , it is impossible to set directly @xmath44 , if the @xmath36 points contain @xmath39 .",
    "it is sufficient to make calculations for two @xmath43 values , @xmath67 ( @xmath68  @xmath69 ) and then take the average : @xmath70 this method was successfully employed in the recent 3n bound state calculations @xcite . in this case",
    "the kernel contains no pole , which makes the calculations even faster .",
    "we use a variant of the lanczos method @xcite to sum the resulting neumann series , which proves to be more accurate than the standard pad scheme .",
    "alternatively , in many calculations using pwd of the nn potential , the on - shell t - matrix is obtained not directly but in two steps .",
    "first one defines the k - matrix through the principal value kernel @xcite    & k^ t m_t(z ) = v^ t m_t & + & + d^3p ",
    "v^ t m_t k^ t m_t(z ) & [ kmatrix ]    and the connection to the t - matrix is given as    & t^ t m_t(z ) = k^ t m_t(z ) & + & - i d^3p ",
    "k^ t m_t(z ) ( z - ) t^ t m_t(z ) . & [ ktmatrix ]    if we take @xmath71 , @xmath72 , then we get the following ( on shell ) relation    & t^ t m_t(z ) = k^ t m_t(z ) & + & - m p_0 d p  k^ t m_t(z ) t^ t m_t(z ) , & [ ktmatrix2 ]    where @xmath73 denotes the two - dimensional angular integration .",
    "including spin degrees of freedom and using the expansion of the k - matrix into the @xmath12 operators ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) , it is easy to find the equation corresponding to ( [ kmatrix ] ) but for the scalar coefficients of the k - matrix , @xmath74 : @xmath75 the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6 ] ) . by simple interpolation or by taking the average over two @xmath43 values",
    ", we get the on - shell k - matrix coefficients , @xmath76 . in order to formulate an equation corresponding to ( [ ktmatrix2 ] )",
    ", we have to take into account that on - shell there are only five independent @xmath12 operators .",
    "this follows directly from the ( on shell ) relation @xmath77 and can be written as @xmath78 using eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.10nn ] ) it is easy to write the on - shell k - matrix as a linear combination of only five operators .",

    "this is demonstrated in sect .",
    "[ section3 ] . in the case when the operator @xmath81 or @xmath82 is removed , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6kk ] ) have to be renumbered accordingly .",
    "in this section we focus on the on - shell t - matrix obtained without employing pwd .",
    "we do not compare our 3d results with the results obtained by standard momentum space pwd , since this comparison was carried out successfully in @xcite .",
    "we show first that the methods discussed in the previous section lead to stable numerical results .",
    "we use the matrix inversion scheme , introduced already in @xcite . in present calculations we use a parallel version of the matrix inversion , based on the scalapack library  @xcite .",
    "we implement also the iterative algorithm and sum up the resulting neumann series using a variant of the lanczos method @xcite .",
    "finally , we solve the equation for the k - matrix and , going on - shell , eliminate either the @xmath83 or the @xmath81 2n operator .",
    "we perform calculations using all these methods for two projectile laboratory kinetic energies , 13 and 300 mev .",
    "we use first the neutron - proton version of a chiral nnlo nn potential  @xcite , described briefly in appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and  [ f2 ] we show results for several nn scattering observables . in the case of 13 mev ,",
    "the agreement among the four types of results is very good both for the neutron - neutron ( left panel ) and the neutron - proton ( right panel ) system . for the energy of 300 mev",
    "we see that the calculations using the k - matrix equation without the @xmath83 operator on - shell , yield slightly different results for the @xmath84 and @xmath57 observables in the case of the neutron - proton system , than the other three schemes .",
    "these numerical instabilities become better visible for the wolfenstein parameters @xcite @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath27 shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . thus this particular numerical scheme should be avoided .    in the case , where iterations are used , we wanted to know how many iterations are needed to achieve full convergence of our results .",
    "we expected that the convergence depends on the nn system internal energy and show in figs  [ f4 ] and  [ f5 ] our results for various numbers of iterations again for the small ( 13 mev ) and large ( 300 mev ) laboratory energy . at 13 mev and for the neutron - neutron system we find that 10 iterations are fully sufficient .",
    "for some observables results obtained with 8 iterations are very close to the predictions based on 20 iterations . for the neutron - proton case",
    "one needs generally 12 iterations . at 300 mev",
    "we see even faster convergence . for the neutron - neutron case predictions based on 6 iterations",
    "have already a correct shape ( this was generally not the case for 13 mev ) and 8 iterations bring us very close to the fully converged results , although some tiny deviations are still visible . for the neutron - proton system results obtained from 10 iterations are still slightly different from the fully converged predictions .",
    "we can thus state that for energies below the pion production threshold , one needs no more than 12 iterations to arrive at fully converged results .",
    "since the essential part of the iteration kernel can be prepared in advance , iterations run very fast , especially for the case of negative 2n internal energy , where no singularity is present .",
    "this method is considered by us as the best for 3n calculations .    in the remaining part of this section we consider the most difficult case in the nucleon - nucleon scattering , namely the proton - proton case with inclusion of the coulomb force . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , contrary to the approaches using the so - called renormalization procedure ( see for example @xcite ) , we add a screened coulomb potential to the ( strong ) proton - proton 2n force given in the operator form and use this sum as input in our 3d calculations .",
    "we work with the proton - proton version of the same chiral nnlo 2n potential and choose a relatively small laboratory energy ( 13 mev ) , where coulomb effects are expected to play an important role .",
    "we assent to two types of screening , the exponential screening , @xmath88 , @xmath89 restricting ourselves to the case @xmath90 and the localized ( transition from @xmath91 to @xmath92 takes place in a finite interval ) screening , @xmath93 , proposed in @xcite : @xmath94 with @xmath95 being the ( unit ) step function .",
    "the 3d momentum space screened coulomb potential is obtained as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in figs .",
    "[ f6 ] and  [ f7 ] we demonstrate a convergence of the results for some observables with the increasing parameter @xmath84 . in the case of the exponential screening with @xmath90",
    "it is achieved for @xmath84= 120 fm , while for the second type of screening @xmath84= 55 fm is sufficient . in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] we show that , as expected , the two screening prescriptions lead to the same final result for the selected proton - proton observables in our fully 3d calculations . the inset in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] serves to compare the two screening functions for the parameters used in the actual calculations .",
    "proton - proton scattering was already considered by us in @xcite .",
    "there we used the vincent - phatak method @xcite and the method combining pwd calculations with the full 3d t - matrix of the screened coulomb potential . using those two methods , we performed calculations for the proton - proton strong potential and screening functions used in this paper .",
    "predictions for the @xmath84 parameters yielding converged results in the case of the fully 3d calculations ( solid line ) are compared in figs.[f9 ] ( exponential screening ) and  [ f10 ] ( localized screening ) with the vincent - phatak method ( dotted line ) and the method combining pwd and 3d approaches ( dashed line ) .",
    "we observe a good or even a very good agreement among all the methods for the polarization observables , especially for the exponential screening .",
    "discrepancies in all the cases , including the most visible ones for the cross section , do not exceed 1 - 2  % .",
    "this agreement provides yet another proof that our numerical treatment of nucleon - nucleon scattering is fully reliable .",
    "in @xcite we formulated an approach to the nn system employing spin - momentum operators multiplied by scalar functions , which only depend on the momentum vectors .",
    "this representation of the nn potential leads to a system of six coupled equations for the scalar functions defining the nn t - matrix .",
    "this system of equations was first solved using the matrix inversion method .    in the present paper",
    "we formulate two other methods to calculate the nucleon - nucleon t - matrix in the same 3d formulation of ref .",
    "our second method is iterative and uses a variant of the lanczos algorithm @xcite .",
    "in addition , as a third possibility , we treat the equation for the k - matrix and obtain the on - shell t - matrix coefficients , solving an additional equation , which connects the on - shell scalar coefficients of the k- and t - matrices . in the second step care is required , because only five spin - momentum operators are independent and not all choices are numerically safe .",
    "we show a very good agreement among all the considered methods for the selected neutron - neutron and neutron - proton observables . in these calculations we use the neutron - proton version of a chiral nnlo potential . in the case of the iteration method",
    "we demonstrate also a fast convergence with respect to the number of iterations .",
    "this iterative method is best suited to be used in the 3n bound state and in the 3n continuum calculations .",
    "in fact it has been already successfully used in the 3n bound state calculations  @xcite , realizing the theoretical formulation given in  @xcite .",
    "last not least , we apply our 3d framework to the problem of proton - proton scattering , using the proton - proton version of the chiral nnlo nn potential , supplemented with the ( screened ) coulomb force .",
    "we show converged results for two different screening functions and find a good agreement with two other methods considered in @xcite .",
