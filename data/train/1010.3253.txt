    "at present , the study of quantum decoherence has acquired a central position in the theoretical research on quantum mechanics .",
    "although the orthodox environment induced decoherence ( eid ) approach addresses decoherence in open systems ( @xcite-@xcite ) , many authors have stressed that closed systems may also experience the phenomenon of decoherence ( @xcite-@xcite ; we have worked from this perspective in @xcite-@xcite ) .    in order to show that the two approaches must not be conceived as rival or alternative , but rather as complementary ,",
    "we have developed a _ general theoretical framework _ for decoherence ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which encompasses decoherence in open and closed systems . according to this general framework",
    ", decoherence is just a particular case of the general phenomenon of irreversibility in quantum mechanics ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , since the quantum state @xmath0 follows a unitary evolution , it can not reach a final equilibrium state for @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , if we want to explain the emergence of non - unitary irreversible evolutions , a further element has to be added : we must split the whole space @xmath2 of all possible observables into a relevant subspace @xmath3 and an irrelevant subspace .",
    "once the essential role played by the selection of the relevant observables is clearly understood , the phenomenon of decoherence can be explained in three general steps :    1 .   *",
    "first step : * the space @xmath4 of relevant observables is defined .",
    "* second step : * the expectation value @xmath5 , for any @xmath6 , is obtained .",
    "this step can be formulated in two different but equivalent ways : * @xmath7 is computed as the expectation value of @xmath8 in the unitarily evolving state @xmath0 . *",
    "a coarse - grained state @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 and its non - unitary evolution ( governed by a master equation ) is solved .",
    "* third step : * it is proved that @xmath11 reaches a final equilibrium value : @xmath12    the final equilibrium state @xmath13 is obviously diagonal in its own eigenbasis , which turns out to be the final equilibrium decoherence basis .",
    "but , from eq .",
    "( [ int-01 ] ) it can not be concluded that @xmath14 ; the mathematicians say that the unitarily evolving quantum state @xmath0 of the whole system _ _ has only a _ weak limit _ , _ _ symbolized as : @xmath15 and equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ int-01 ] ) .",
    "physically this weak limit means that , although the off - diagonal terms of @xmath0 never vanish through the unitary evolution , the system decoheres _ from an observational point of view _ , that is , from the viewpoint given by any relevant observable @xmath6 . from this general perspective , the phenomenon of decoherence is relative because the off - diagonal terms of @xmath0 vanish only from the viewpoint of the relevant observables * * @xmath6 .",
    "this general framework strictly applies when the limit of eq .",
    "( [ int-01 ] ) exists .",
    "this happen when the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix vanish by destructive interference according to the riemann - lebesgue theorem .",
    "in fact , when the relevant observables @xmath6 read@xmath16 where @xmath17 is the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a basis of @xmath4 , and the states are linear functionals belonging to @xmath21 , the dual of @xmath4 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the basis of @xmath21 , then the expectation value of any observable @xmath6 in the state @xmath0 can be computed as @xmath24 when the function @xmath25 is regular ( precisely , when it is @xmath26 in variable @xmath27 ) , the riemann - lebesgue theorem can be applied to eq .",
    "( [ int-06 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the second term vanishes and @xmath7 converges to a stable value @xmath28 where @xmath13 is diagonal in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is clear that the riemann - lebesgue theorem strictly applies only in cases of continuous energy spectrum .",
    "however , we also know that we can use the results coming from the continuous realm in quasi - continuous cases , that is , in discrete models where ( i ) the energy spectrum is quasi - continuous , i.e. , has a small discrete energy spacing , and ( ii ) the functions of energy used in the formalism are such that the sums in which they are involved can be approximated by riemann integrals .",
    "these conditions are rather weak : in fact , the overwhelming majority of the physical models studied in the literature on dynamics , thermodynamics , quantum mechanics and quantum field theory are quasi - continuous .",
    "the general aim of the present work is to supply a rigorous formulation of this intuitive idea . in particular",
    ", we will develop a discrete analogue of the riemann - lebesgue theorem , and this task will lead us to introduce a lemma in terms of which it is possible to predict whether a discrete system decoheres or not . for this purpose ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will consider the three cases that can be distinguished regarding the discrete analogue of the riemann integral involved in the riemann - lebesgue theorem .",
    "section 3 will be devoted to formulate the conditions for the validity of the discrete analogue of the riemann integral . in section 4 ,",
    "the lemma that constitutes the core of the proposed method is presented , and its relationship with the discrete fourier transform is pointed out .",
    "finally , in the conclusions we will stress the fact that , whereas the usual strategy in this field is to rely on that computer simulations , our lemma makes possible to draw conclusions without that strategy ; moreover , our results are particularly adequate to take advantage of the many mathematical methods of software engineering based on the discrete fourier transform .",
    "the riemann - lebesgue theorem @xmath29the mathematical expression of destructive interference@xmath29 establishes that@xmath30  in order to obtain a version that can be used in the discrete case , let us analyze the discrete analogue of the riemann integral @xmath31:@xmath32 where @xmath33 ,  and @xmath34 is a dimensionless time . since the function @xmath35 is a finite sum of sine functions @xmath36 , it has a recurrence or poincar time .",
    "given an initial state @xmath37 , the poincar time @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "this means that@xmath40",
    "since the system comes back to the initial state when @xmath41 , there is no rigorous discrete analogue of the riemann - lebesgue theorem .",
    "nevertheless , three possible situations can be distinguished :    1 .   if @xmath42 , then @xmath43 becomes infinitesimal and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , this situation can be considered a continuous - spectrum case where the riemann - lebesgue theorem can be applied .",
    "if @xmath45  is large , then @xmath46 is very small .",
    "then , the sum turns out to be close to the riemann integral , and the the situation can be approximated to the continuous - spectrum case where the riemann - lebesgue theorem can be applied .",
    "this condition is satisfied in a concrete example in @xcite : in spite of the fact that , strictly speaking , a system with discrete spectrum never reaches equilibrium due to poincar recurrence , that paper shows that , for times @xmath47 , the discrete spectrum can be approximated by a continuous spectrum where the considered functions satisfy the usual conditions of regularity and integrability .",
    "if @xmath45  is not large , then @xmath43 is far from being infinitesimal , and the sum can not be approximated by a riemann integral .",
    "consequently , the riemann - lebesgue theorem is not applicable because there is no destructive interference .",
    "let us notice that the difference between cases 2 and 3 is not absolute , to the extent that the precise criterion to decide when @xmath45 is large has not been defined",
    ". in the following subsections such a criterion will be established .",
    "the problem is to find the conditions for the time @xmath48 such that @xmath49 when @xmath50 : therefore , in the time - scale @xmath51   $ ] it can be considered that @xmath45 is large enough to make the continuous - spectrum approximation applicable . in order to face this problem , we begin by consider a fixed time @xmath34 and by decomposing the exponential of eq .",
    "( [ drlt-02 ] ) as @xmath52 where the points @xmath53 belong to a discrete set @xmath54 with @xmath55 to @xmath45 .",
    "let us analyze the particular case where @xmath56 , precisely,@xmath57 in particular , we will consider the sums@xmath58 we begin by considering @xmath59 , because the case of @xmath60 will be analogous .",
    "the sum @xmath59 vanishes when its terms cancel by pairs , that is , when for any @xmath61@xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 . since @xmath53",
    ", this happens when @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "however , since in general @xmath69 , the condition of eq .",
    "( [ drlt-09 ] ) is not always satisfied .",
    "then , instead of requiring that the terms of @xmath59 cancel with each other exactly , we will only require that the corresponding difference be small in the following sense:@xmath70 where now @xmath71 and@xmath72 if @xmath73 , the taylor development of @xmath74 leads to@xmath75 but , on the other hand , @xmath76 then , if @xmath77 , from eqs .",
    "( [ drlt-14 ] ) and ( [ drlt-15 ] ) we obtain the condition of eq .",
    "( [ drlt-10 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the condition of approximate cancelling is ( see eq .",
    "( [ drlt-11 ] ) ) @xmath78    now we will express the condition of approximate cancelling of eq .",
    "( [ drlt-17 ] ) in terms of the time @xmath34 .",
    "let us begin by noticing that the condition is not satisfied for @xmath79 , since @xmath80 .",
    "then , the first condition is @xmath81 .",
    "now , by recalling that @xmath53 , from the expression of @xmath82 in eq .",

( [ drlt-19 ] ) implies that @xmath88 therefore , the condition @xmath77 of approximate cancelling turns out to be@xmath89    up to this point we have proved that , for @xmath90 , @xmath91 approximately cancels with @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fig-01 ] shows an example of this situation , where point 1 is cancelled by point 9 , point 2 by point 10 , ... , point 8 by point 16 .",
    "however , this is not the most general case , since the points cancel by pairs only when @xmath93 . in the general case",
    "there are points with no counterpart to be cancelled .",
    "an example of this situation is shown in figure [ fig-02 ] , where points @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are not cancelled .    in order to analyze this general situation ,",
    "let us consider the worst  case , when the points of a whole half - period are not cancelled , namely , when @xmath98 .",
    "since in @xmath34 there are @xmath99 points , in such a half - period there are @xmath100 points , whose contribution @xmath101 to the sum @xmath59 is@xmath102 the upper boundary of this contribution is@xmath103 then , the contribution @xmath101 of the non cancelled points is irrelevant when @xmath104 , and this adds the condition@xmath105    summing up , if we combine eqs .",
    "( [ drlt-22 ] ) and ( [ drlt-25 ] ) , we obtain the condition on the time - scale that guarantees the approximate cancelling of the terms of @xmath59:@xmath106 by means of the same argument applied to @xmath60 we obtain an analogous result that , when combined with eq .",
