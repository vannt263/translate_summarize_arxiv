    "the causal character of a singularity has a well defined meaning within the theory of conformal boundaries @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of this causal character is fundamental since whenever the spacetime possesses timelike or past null singularities there are always null geodesics which are past incomplete .",
    "if such a singularity could develop from a generic gravitational collapse in the framework of general relativity theory , this would mean that the theory would lose its predictability .",
    "the question on whether general relativity contains a built - in safety feature that precludes this possibility was put forward by penrose in 1969 @xcite and gave rise to what is known as the _ cosmic censorship conjecture _",
    "many counterexamples to the ccc have been proposed as well as many arguments in its favour ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) so that the question of the ccc remains open .    in this article we will deal with probably the most interesting type of singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes : the _ zero - areal - radius singularities _ , i.e. , given the _",
    "areal radius _",
    "@xmath1 defined such that the area of a 2-sphere is @xmath2 , we will be interested in singularities _ at _ @xmath0 . in the current literature",
    "the study of the causal character of the @xmath0 singularities has been carried out for important particular solutions . in a few simple cases",
    "the singular conformal boundary has been obtained by using a conformal compactification ( see , for instance , ) , while in most cases there is not an analytical compactification and , as an alternative method , the causal character of the singularities has been studied through the analysis of radial null geodesics around them ( see , for example , ) .",
    "in addition to the analysis of particular cases , this last technique allows some _ general _ approaches for studying zero - areal - radius singularities .",
    "in particular , it has led to show @xcite that the causal character of the singularity is related to the _ mass function _ .",
    "more general studies on the formation of _ naked _ singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes along these lines can be found in @xcite , @xcite and , by using ad hoc devised procedure , in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , by using the techniques of the qualitative behaviour of dynamic systems on the differential equations satisfied by the radial null geodesics we were able to present the most comprehensive scheme so far to try to find out their causal characterization taking into account , and analyzing , the possible limitations of the approach . however , this work was carried out in specific coordinates ( the so called _ radiative coordinates _ ) , so that its results were restricted to models described in these coordinates .",
    "our aim in this article is to show that the causal character of the zero - areal - radius ( @xmath0 ) singularity in spherically symmetric models is related with some specific invariants .",
    "apart from being an interesting result from a theoretical point of view , this coordinate independent approach means that , if some assumptions are satisfied , one could find out the causal character of a model s singularity algorithmically through the computation of these invariants in arbitrary coordinates .",
    "in order to try to reach our goal we will base our approach in an analysis of the results in our previous article @xcite .",
    "we will show that our previous results admit an interpretation and rewriting in terms of some invariants and we will analyze and explicitly state the limits for the applicability of our results coming from our specific approach . on the other hand , throughout the article we will use a geometrical approach requiring only the existence of a spacetime , but not the fulfillment of einstein s equations .",
    "thus , we just try to discover the possibilities allowed by this geometrical approach which includes the classical as well as the semiclassical framework .",
    "the paper has been divided as follows : in section [ basis ] we revise well - known properties of spherically symmetric spacetimes and of the radial null geodesics , but emphasizing the corresponding degrees of differentiability for each defined object ( what will be an important aspect for the later development of the work ) . in section [ coordchange ]",
    "we analyze the relationship between general coordinate systems and the coordinate system used in @xcite .",
    "the different cases that appear when treating the causal character of singularities are treated from section [ m_neq0 ] on . in particular , section [ m_neq0 ]",
    "is devoted to the analysis of _ singularities with non - null mass function_. section [ sec_m=0 ] deals with the preliminaries required to the study of _ singularities with null mass function_. finally , sections [ sechyper ] , [ secnonhyper ] and [ secnoniso ] analyze every _ null mass function _ subcase in detail .",
    "let us consider a simply connected open set @xmath3 in a spherically symmetric spacetime and such that a part of its boundary consists of a @xmath0 interval .",
    "the metric line element of an oriented spherically symmetric spacetime can be ( and for practical purposes it is usually ) written in the local chart endowed with coordinates @xmath4 in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an oriented two - dimensional lorentzian metric ( @xmath7=@xmath8 ) , @xmath9 and .    in the lorentzian two - surface orthogonal to the 2-spheres two nonvanishing null vector fields",
    "may be defined such that they are linearly independent at each point . if some differentiability requirements are satisfied in @xmath3 the integral curves of the two null vector fields provide us with two families ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) of affinely parametrized null geodesics called the _ radial null geodesics_. take , for example , the geodesics belonging to the @xmath10 family satisfying @xmath12 where @xmath13 is their affine parameter .",
    "the theory of ordinary differential equations @xcite together with the definition of the christoffel symbols @xmath14 guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the affinelly parametrized geodesics provided that @xmath15 is at least @xmath16 and @xmath17 . from now on we will guarantee the existence and uniqueness of affinely parametrized null geodesics by assuming that @xmath15 is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 means @xmath20 and that the @xmath21th - order derivatives are locally lipshitz .",

    "this procedure requires that the radial null geodesics from at least one family , say @xmath10 , _ reach _ ( or _ leave _ ) every point in the interval , what will be assumed in the next sections of this article . on the other hand ,",
    "let us comment that provided that a @xmath0 interval is not _ reached _ ( or _ left _ ) by radial null geodesics of any family then the causal characterization of the interval is straightforward since this interval can not be translated into a piecewise @xmath35 interval in the conformal boundary of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "it can only be translated into a _ point _ where the boundary is not a @xmath35 curve and , thus , where there is not tangent vector properly defining its causal character .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the main goal of this article is to extend the coordinate dependent results presented in @xcite so that they can be used independently of the coordinate system chosen to work with , i.e. , to provide the causal characterization of @xmath0-singularities in a invariant manner . in order to do this , in this section we will deal with the connection between a general coordinate system of the type used for ( [ mi ] ) and the coordinate system used in @xcite .    [ coocha ] under the assumptions that the metric ( [ mi ] ) is @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , and @xmath36 ( or , equivalently ,",

    "this lemma is based in the fact that , since @xmath39 is @xmath24 and @xmath1 is @xmath18 , there is a class @xmath18 map @xmath44 . the inverse function theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) guarantees the existence of @xmath18 functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 provided that the jacobian determinant @xmath49 is not null in @xmath3 .",
    "along this work we will denote the open set @xmath50 by @xmath51 .",
    "it follows that we can write the function @xmath52 as @xmath53 , where the chain rule guarantees that @xmath54 will also be at least a @xmath32 function in the variables @xmath55 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the condition @xmath56 or , equivalently , @xmath37 implies that the vectors associated with these one - forms can not be parallel : @xmath57 is @xmath58 . in this way , taking into account that @xmath59 will be @xmath32 ( @xmath19 ) in @xmath3 we can define the invariant non - null constant @xmath60 note that it is invariant under future directed reparametrizations of @xmath61 . if @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) , the expansion of the null geodesics with tangent vector @xmath61 is positive ( negative , respectively ) in every point of @xmath51 .",
    "if we perform the coordinate change @xmath38 then , due to the light - like character of the coordinate @xmath39 , the metric of the spacetime ( [ mi ] ) will take the form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the general future directed and affinely parametrized null vector @xmath61 and the future directed null vector @xmath67 tangent to the @xmath68 family satisfying @xmath69 can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 depends on the affine parameter chosen for @xmath61 . clearly , sign@xmath72sign@xmath73 , so that we can rewrite @xmath73 as @xmath74 with @xmath42 .",

    "if one evaluates the function @xmath52 with this form of the metric and uses ( [ bbeta ] ) one finds @xmath81 thus , taking into account ( [ bbeta ] ) and ( [ achi]),we obtain the required form for the metric ( [ metrad ] ) with the degree of differentiability stated in the lemma .",
    "[ corm ] under the assumptions in lemma [ coocha ] the mass function @xmath82 is a @xmath32 function .",

    "in particular , the function @xmath84 can be written with the help of ( [ beta ] ) , and the appropriate labeling\"@xmath85 . ] , as a function of @xmath86 : @xmath87",
    "in this section we will discuss the causal character of @xmath0 in a point @xmath89 such that @xmath88 , where @xmath90 .",
    "this condition implies that there is a scalar curvature singularity at @xmath34 @xcite , so that @xmath34 does not belong to the spacetime , but to its singular boundary .",

    "this result can be found in our previous article @xcite where it was shown in specific coordinates .",
    "however , taking into account that @xmath94 is a scalar invariant , the proposition is true for other coordinate systems and it is , thus , an invariant result .",
    "let us reiterate that the requirement of , at least , a @xmath16 metric is a minimum assumption for the existence and uniqueness of radial null geodesics in the spacetime .",

    "this is the most involved case .",
    "it is known that if @xmath98 the causal character of @xmath0 at @xmath34 admits any possibility : spacelike , lightlike or timelike @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question is : are in this case other invariants which define the causal character of @xmath0 independently of the coordinate system used ? in order to answer this , let us introduce in this section some new definitions and lemmas .",
    "for instance , in spherical symmetry there is an invariantly defined vector , the kodama vector @xcite , which is also known to possess very interesting properties ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the volume form associated with the two - metric @xmath6 .",

    "we have seen that , if the assumptions in lemma [ coocha ] are satisfied , the functions @xmath107 and @xmath80 are @xmath32 functions defined in an open set @xmath51 .",
    "we will now see that these functions can be extended beyond the open set provided that some conditions are fulfilled .",
    "in particular , we are mainly interested in an extension of the functions around @xmath0 that , while it has not any physical meaning , will allow us to apply the theory of the qualitative behaviour of dynamic systems in a open set centered in a point of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "[ extens ] provided that there is a natural number @xmath108 such that the limits of the functions @xmath94 and @xmath84 and of their ith - order derivatives , for all @xmath109 , as every point in the boundary of the open set is approached , exist ( and are finite ) then the functions @xmath94 and @xmath84 admit a @xmath110 extension @xmath111 and @xmath112 .    in order to show this it suffices to define the extended function and its derivatives for all points @xmath113 in the boundary of the open set @xmath51 as @xmath114 for all integers @xmath115 , @xmath116 such that @xmath117 . in this way the lemma can be considered as a simple case of whitney s extension theorem @xcite and the existence of @xmath110 extensions @xmath111 and @xmath112 that coincide with @xmath94 and @xmath84 in @xmath51",
    "is guaranteed .",
    "we will denote the extended domain of definition by @xmath118 .",
    "on the other hand , we want to work with the original coordinates @xmath119 and infer from here the extendibility of the functions @xmath107 and @xmath80 .",
    "we can do this by using the chain rule applied to the derivatives of @xmath120 and @xmath121 as the _ boundary points _ are approached .",
