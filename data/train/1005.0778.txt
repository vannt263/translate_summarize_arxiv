    "the investigation of nonlinear chains , started by fermi , pasta and ulam in 1955 @xcite , still remains an active and interesting area of research which attracts a significant interest of nonlinear community ( see e.g. reviews @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "usually , in such chains the nonlinear terms are relatively weak compared to the linear ones and strong nonlinear effects appear only at sufficiently high energy excitations .",
    "however , there are also other types of chains where the linear modes are absent and the dynamics is strongly nonlinear at arbitrarily small energies . in such chains a time can be rescaled with energy and hence the system always remains in a strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "a prominent example is the hertz lattice which describes elastically interacting hard balls where the elasticity parameter scales as a square - root of the displacement @xcite corresponding to the nonlinearity index @xmath0 .",
    "nesterenko @xcite described a compact traveling - wave solution in the hertz lattice now known as compacton .",
    "a rigorous mathematical description of compactons was given by rosenau and hyman @xcite for a class of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) with nonlinear dispersion .",
    "a detailed analysis of compacton dynamics on lattices with various nonlinearity index has been performed recently in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that on a finite lattice interactions between compactons lead to chaotic dynamics characterized by a spectrum of positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "a well known example of such compacton chain is the toy `` newton s cradle '' @xcite .    in the compacton lattice",
    "the dynamics is chaotic at arbitrarily small energies when more than one compacton are exited .",
    "therefore it is interesting to understand what happens in such quantum lattices and what are the properties of quantum compacton vacuum .",
    "the studies of such quantum chains are reported in this work .",
    "we use the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method and the approach developed for the quantum frenkel - kontorova model as it is described in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to understand the properties of quantum compacton vacuum and low energy excitations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the recent progress with cold atoms allowed to realize a quantum newton s cradle @xcite and to study energy redistribution between atoms .",
    "the experimental progress stimulated also theoretical studies of integrability and non - integrability in one - dimensional atomic lattices at high energy excitations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that we study the properties of vacuum and low energy excitations in quantum compacton lattices when the linear terms are absent and nonlinearity is always strong in the classical case .",
    "thus the classical dynamics of such compacton chain is always chaotic @xcite ( except a special case of one compacton moving in a lattice ) .",
    "what are the properties of the quantum compacton chain is the subject of studies of this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model description is given in section ii , the properties of sound waves in the classical compacton chains are analyzed in section iii , simple analytical estimates for the compacton chain are presented in section iv , numerical results of the qmc are presented in section v and the results are summarized in section vi .",
    "the quantum compacton chain is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where index @xmath2 marks @xmath3 particles in the chain and @xmath4 is the nonlinearity index . here",
    "@xmath5 gives the particle coordinate counted from the equilibrium distance between particles which is taken to be @xmath6 .",
    "for the newton cradle @xmath6 is given by the ball diameter .",
    "we use the dimensionless units in which the particle mass is equal to unity and the momentum @xmath7 gives the particle velocity . for the quantum problem",
    "the operators of momentum and coordinate have the usual commutator @xmath8 = -i \\hbar \\delta_{l , l'}$ ] with a dimensionless planck constant @xmath9 . we assume the periodic boundary conditions with @xmath10 , @xmath11 or fixed ends boundary conditions .",
    "the later is a specific case of even number of particles @xmath12 .",
    "we note that the particles are distinguishable since they are located at well defined positions .",
    "let us remind few known results for the harmonic chain at @xmath13 . by a canonical transformation to normal modes @xmath14 , @xmath15",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) takes the form @xmath16 with the normal mode frequencies",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and wave numbers @xmath19 , @xmath20 . here and below we use the fixed boundary conditions with @xmath21 and @xmath22 particles",
    ".    it is convenient to introduce sine modes via relations @xmath23{\\frac{2}{n } } \\sum_l \\sin ( q_k l ) \\hat{x}_l$ ] , @xmath24{\\frac{2}{n } } \\sum_k \\sin ( q_k l ) \\hat{s}_k$ ] .",
    "the vacuum state of the chain is a product of vacuum states of all modes . for any mode in the vacuum state",
    "one has an average of mode energy @xmath25 being @xmath26 and hence @xmath27 thus different harmonics are independent and as a result the squared deviation from equilibrium for a particle @xmath2 is @xmath28 . for the central particle @xmath29",
    "the displacement diverges logarithmically with the chain length @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath32 the displacement is of the order of unity for @xmath33 .",
    "we will assume that such displacements are small compared to the distance @xmath6 between particles .",
    "the spacial correlator of the chain can be also explicitly calculated as @xmath34 where the brackets note the quantum average .",
    "using ( [ eq3 ] ) we obtain after summation over all @xmath2 @xmath35    at finite temperature @xmath36 the relation ( [ eq3 ] ) is modified for the usual expression for bosons @xmath37 with this form of @xmath38 one can obtain the expression for the correlator @xmath39 at finite temperature .",
    "the properties of the chain can be also characterized by the static form factor defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 can be viewed as a momentum transfer during a process of photon scattering , and @xmath6 is the spacing of the chain lattice .    before to start the studies of the quantum compacton problem at @xmath42 we consider in the next section the propagation of sound waves in the classical chain at @xmath43 .",
    "to find the spectrum of sound waves and their decay rates we simulate numerically the dynamics of classical system ( [ eq1 ] ) at @xmath43 , @xmath44 with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulations are done with a runge - kutta - nystrom method with time step @xmath45 .",
    "initially a random distribution of momenta @xmath7 is seeded , so that the total energy per particle is 1 . after a transient of time @xmath46",
    "a perturbation of the type @xmath47 is imposed with @xmath48 . the wave number @xmath49 is changed in the range @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding fourier mode of @xmath5 changes in time approximately as @xmath51 .",
    "this time dependence is obtained from an ensemble of particles .",
    "we use up to @xmath52 particles in an ensemble to obtain good averaging of statistical fluctuations .     in the classical compacton lattice ( [ eq1 ] ) at @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath44 and energy per particle @xmath53 equal to unity , at small wave numbers @xmath54 the spectrum is close to a linear law of sound waves @xmath55 .",
    "top panels : decay rate of sound waves @xmath56 , at small @xmath54 we have @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",

    "-0.3 cm    the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the spectrum of sound waves @xmath59 and their decay rates @xmath56 .",
    "the frequency spectrum is close to the spectrum of sound in a harmonic lattice @xmath60 with @xmath61 . at small @xmath54 we have the spectrum of sound waves .",
    "the effective velocity of sound for phonon like excitations is given by @xmath62 . here",
    "the dependence on a given average energy per particle @xmath53 appears since a typical frequency of particle oscillations is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "the speed of sound in the physical lattice with distance @xmath6 between particles is @xmath64 .",
    "the decay rate of these waves drops algebraically with the decrease of the wave vector @xmath54 as @xmath65 .",
    "we obtain the value @xmath58 that is close to the generic exponent @xmath66 for the decay rate in nonlinear lattices ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus even if the dynamics inside a compacton lattice is strongly chaotic ( see @xcite ) the long wave oscillation properties of the whole lattice are well described by effective sound waves . in a certain sense",
    "the situation is similar to sound in a gas media : each particle moves chaotically but the collective long wave excitations are well described by sound waves .",
    "it is interesting to note that recently a localization of sound waves in a random three - dimensional elastic network of metallic balls has been observed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "such a system can be viewed as a random three - dimensional newton s cradle .",
    "however , our studies here are restricted to the one - dimensional case .",
    "the sound velocity @xmath67 in a gas is given by the derivative of pressure @xmath68 over the gas mass density @xmath69 at fixed entropy @xmath70 ( adiabatic process ) : @xmath71 . since the pressure is proportional to the force @xmath72 ,",
    "hence , @xmath73 .",
    "this leads to a simple estimate for the sound velocity based on the virial theorem according to which @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are particle kinetic and potential energies and brackets mark their average values . since the temperature is proportional to the kinetic energy we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 is an average displacement of a particle .",
    "this gives @xmath79 for the classical case this expression agrees with the above analytical results for @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "for the quantum compacton chain we can use the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath82 for the minimization of the ground state energy @xmath83 that gives @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . as a result",
    "the sound velocity of the quantum chain is @xmath86    for @xmath13 this velocity is independent of @xmath9 but for @xmath42 it decreases with @xmath9 that corresponds to the decrease of the ground state energy of a nonlinear oscillator .",
    "the properties of the ground state are analyzed in the numerical simulations presented in the next section .",
    "for our numerical simulations of quantum chain ( [ eq1 ] ) we use the metropolis algorithm ( ma ) @xcite in the euclidean time @xmath87 related to the system temperature @xmath88 .",
    "the simulations are done in the same way as for the studies of the quantum frenkel - kontorova model described in @xcite .",
    "a general description of this qmc method can be found in @xcite .",
    "the paths in the discretized euclidean time are generated by the statistical sum @xmath89 \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which links the problem to a statistical mechanics for configuration distribution of some lattice of @xmath90 size where @xmath22 is number of particles and @xmath91 is number of discrete steps of size @xmath92 in the euclidean time interval @xmath87 . as usual",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are used in this time with @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in our numerical studies we use up to @xmath95 , @xmath96 and up to @xmath97 metropolis updates .",
    "we fix @xmath44 for numerical simulations .",
    "the numerical simulations assume a generation of configurations @xmath98 with probability proportional to their weights in the statistical sum .",
    "the metropolis method looks very efficient , providing an update step gives rather large modifications for a give site .",
    "however , corresponding modifications are local and are dominated by the nearest neighbor sites , that results in a significant slowdown for long wave configurations .",
    "thus it is useful to combine the metropolis method with the microcanonic dynamics ( mcd ) method .",
    "the mcd method is a noiseless algorithm and it works as follows : all variables @xmath99 are considered as some coordinates , and the sum @xmath100",
    "\\equiv    \\mathcal{u}(x)\\ ] ] as a potential energy of a certain system .",
    "then , a set of auxiliary momentum variables @xmath101 is added and the equations of motion are solved numerically in an auxiliary update `` time '' variable @xmath102 : @xmath103 with this dynamical description the system evolves over some iso - energy hypersurface in the phase space , and we get an ensemble of configurations .     and its fit by the dependence ( [ eq14 ] ) ; black curve shows numerical data , dashed red / gray curve shows the fit ( curves are overlapped ) .",

    "-0.3 cm    however , an obvious disadvantage of such a method is that one needs to solve the differential equations numerically with a step which becomes smaller for decreasing @xmath92 , due to the terms @xmath109 with @xmath92 in the denominator .",
    "but even worse , these terms act as some noise that reduces the relaxation rate along @xmath2 ( space dimension ) .",
    "thus , in order to accelerate the relaxation processes we introduce into @xmath109 a parameter @xmath110 @xmath111 .\\ ] ] then the update step is organized as follows : + a ) the fast mixing stage , with @xmath112 , at which the smallness of denominator is canceled , here the mcd method is applied during the auxiliary `` time '' interval @xmath113 ; + b ) return to @xmath114 and application of the metropolis updates at maximum 400 updates .",
    "such a combined approach allows us to reduce significantly the number of metropolis updates and to have more rapid numerical simulations .",
    "we checked that both methods ( only ma steps and ma steps combined with the mcd method ) give the same results .",
    "the ensemble of quantum paths , obtained by the numerical methods described above , determines the properties of the vacuum ground state of the system .",
    "averages of various quantities over this ensemble give the corresponding average observables at this state .",

    "for example , a ground state of a sinai billiard can be rather well approximated by a hartree - fock trial function with one maximum so that the signatures of quantum chaos appear only in the semiclassical regime for highly excited states @xcite .",
    "this is more or less natural for systems with few degrees of freedom .",
    "our case has infinite number of degrees of freedom but in spite of that the quantum compacton vacuum remains rather similar to a vacuum of a harmonic chain in which the oscillator frequency is dependent of an effective planck constant .",
    "it is possible that certain signatures of such quasi - integrability at low energies find their manifestations in a slow chaotization of excitations in a quantum newton s cradle observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "however , we should note that such a statement can be considered only on a qualitative level of rigor since the model ( [ eq1 ] ) at @xmath43 or @xmath136 gives only an approximate description of ball interactions ( see discussion at @xcite ) .    however , let us note that our methods are well adapted for analysis of low energy oscillatory quantum waves .",
    "it is possible that other approaches should be used to detect quantum chock wave type excitations with large displacements between two parts of the chain ( in principle the energy of such type compacton like excitations is not very high and is independent of the lattice size ) .",
    "other methods should be used to analyze such type of excitations .",
    "it is possible that a degeneracy of chaos in a vicinity of quantum compacton vacuum is linked to the space homogeneity of the model ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the ground state of the quantum frenkel - kontorova model has much more rich properties @xcite appearing due to a presence of periodic potential .",
