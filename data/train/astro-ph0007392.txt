    "_ ginga _ , _ asca _ and recent _ bepposax _  x - ray observations of seyfert 1 galaxies strongly support a general _ observational _ framework that includes : ionized absorption by a warm absorber ( wa ) , a steep intrinsic power - law continuum , a compton reflection hump and associated neutral fek@xmath7 line ( narrow and/or broad ) , and a high - energy cutoff ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "these observational results have raised the following questions :    * what is the location of the x - ray reprocessor ?",
    "is it the accretion disk , the broad - line region ( blr ) and/or the molecular torus ? is the answer the same for all seyfert 1s ? * where is the location of the wa ?",
    "is it within the blr and/or the molecular torus or is it external to them ?",
    "is there only one wa ?",
    "* does @xmath8 differ from source - to - source ( as currently shown by _",
    "bepposax _ ,",
    "piro 1999 , matt 2000 ) or is it variable with time and/or flux in any single object ?",
    "in order to address these questions , we have performed multiple ( 4 ) observations of the prototypical seyfert 1 galaxy ic4329a to obtain time - resolved spectral constrains on the wa , reflection continuum , fe k@xmath9 line and , possibly , @xmath8 .",
    "this is potentially the best way ( see also weaver 2000 ) to establish whether these observational features are produced from material near the source ( e.g. the accretion disk , in which case short lags , @xmath101000 s , are expected between the reflection and continuum variations ) or farther away ( e.g. in the blr or torus , in which case longer lags of at least @xmath0 10@xmath11 s are expected ) .",
    "ic 4329a @xmath12 is a seyfert 1 galaxy well studied in x - rays ( miyoshi et al . 1988 ; piro , yamauchi & matsuoka 1990 ; fiore et al . 1992 ; cappi et al .",
    "1996 ) and hard x - rays ( fabian et al . 1993 ; madejski et al . 1995",
    "; zdziarski et al .",
    "it offers the best opportunity to address the above mentioned variability issues because it is among the brightest known seyferts in x - rays ( f(2 - 10kev)@xmath01.6@xmath210@xmath3erg @xmath4s@xmath5 ) and shows only _ moderate _",
    "variability on short ( @xmath10 day ) timescales , but large variability on longer timescales ( a factor 2 - 3 in a few days ) , both below and above 10 kev ( done , madejski & zycki 2000 ; fabian et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "_ bepposax _ observed ic 4329a in 1996 for 100 ks ( perola et al .",
    "1999 ) , and then subsequently 3 times in 1998 , with the 3 observations spaced approximately 5 days apart .",
    "as expected , the source did _ not _ vary much _ within _ each observation .",
    "unfortunately , it did not vary much _ between _ the 4 observations either ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , despite the large and systematic flux variations typically observed in ic4329a by rxte ( done , madejski & zycki 2000 ) .",
    "spectral ratios were produced between all observations , in search of any model - independent spectral variations ( fig .",
    "we find marginal evidence for variability of the spectral features at @xmath13 kev and at @xmath1410  kev , but we find no clear variations in the fek@xmath9 and reflection component intensities , as well as in the high-@xmath8 .",
    "the variations at low energies are most likely due to variability of the ionization state of the wa responding to continuum variations , but complications due to the presence of a possible scattered component and/or intrinsic soft ( excess ) component can not be ruled out .",
    "spectral fitting of each observation with a complex model including 2 absorption edges , a steep power - law continuum , a reflection component with associated fek@xmath6 , and a high-@xmath8 gave best - fit parameters similar to those reported by perola et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with somewhat larger errors ( e.g. @xmath15 0.1 , r @xmath16 , @xmath8 @xmath0 250 @xmath17 100 kev ) .",
    "3 shows the marginal variations of the fek line intensity and equivalent width .",
    "4 shows the ( similar ) best - fit broad - band spectra of two different observations .",
    "the most interesting result of the present analysis is that despite a 30% flux increase between obs . 1 and obs",
    ". 2 , the line intensity became surprisingly weak ( compare fig . 1 and fig .",
    "3 ) . during the higher flux obs .",
    "3 the line re - established its typical value of @xmath0 100 - 150 ev , though . in other words , there is some evidence ( at a @xmath0 2 @xmath18 significance level ) that the fe k@xmath6 line _ does not _ follow `` instantaneously '' ( at least within 40 ks ) the continuum variations , but it _ does _ on a timescale between 410 days .",
    "* moderate variations of the absorption structure , most likely related to the warm absorber , are apparently detected but require further investigation for more quantitative conclusions . * despite the unprecedented statistics of these observations , we find _ no _ significant spectral variations of the compton reflection continuum , the power law spectral index and the high - enegy cutoff .",
    "this is probably because _ bepposax _ unfortunately caught ic 4329a at a not too different flux level ( 30% variation ) in all four observations hampering , thereby , any spectral variability .",
    "* there is marginal evidence that the fek@xmath6 line is being produced by the outer regions of the accretion disk in ic 4329a , thereby suggesting a possible explanation for the lack of a clear broad fek@xmath6 line in this object .",
