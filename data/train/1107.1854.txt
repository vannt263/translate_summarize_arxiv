    "the remarkable material properties of biological membranes , inherent in their nature of complex bi - dimensional visco - elastic films , play an important part in membrane deformations .",
    "giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs ) are model membranes made of amphiphilic lipid molecules that self - assemble into closed bilayers in water .",

    "these features have made them very attractive objects to study the physics of a number of phenomena in cellular biology .",

    "a localized chemical gradient is created close to the membrane by microinjection .",
    "the response of the membrane to such a localized gradient can be significantly different from the one caused by a uniform perturbation of its environment .",
    "in particular , we will show in this paper that a change of the spontaneous curvature and a change of the preferred area per lipid lead to different dynamics in the case of a local perturbation .",
    "in contrast , when uniform perturbations are studied , observing the change of the equilibrium shape does not enable to distinguish between these two types of changes of the membrane properties  @xcite .    in a previous work  @xcite , we have reported both theoretically and experimentally a chemically - driven membrane shape instability observed when guvs are submitted to a local ph increase . in this instability , a local chemical modification affecting some lipids in one monolayer of the membrane changes the preferred area per lipid , thereby inducing a transient local bilayer curvature .",
    "since only one monolayer is affected , the lateral redistribution of the lipids is strongly slowed down by the intermonolayer friction .",
    "when such a chemical modification is applied to a small enough surface , it triggers the ejection of a tubule growing exponentially toward the chemical source .    in this paper , we describe in more detail the first phase of this local curvature instability , before the tubule ejection , and we present a more complete comparison of our experimental results with the predictions of our model . in the experiments , the chemical modification of the vesicle membrane has been achieved by locally delivering to the membrane outer leaflet a basic solution of naoh with a micropipette .",
    "we have performed a time - step chemical modifications ( pulseexperiments ) and we have measured the time evolution of the height of the deformation of the vesicle with respect to its initial shape .",
    "our theoretical model has been completed by taking into account in our dynamical equations the spontaneous curvature change in addition to the equilibrium density change induced by the chemical modification .",
    "we have also compared these two effects .",
    "the comparison of the experimental results with the predictions of our model has been performed by fitting the measured deformation height with the solution of the dynamical equations of our model .",
    "several `` pulse '' experiments , done on three different guvs , have been analyzed .",

    "giant vesicles were formed by the liposome electroformation method  @xcite in a thermostated chamber . the particular electroformation protocol used in this work",
    "was the following : lipid mixture solutions were prepared in chloroform / diethyl ether / methanol ( 2:7:1 ) with a total lipid concentration of 1 mg / ml . all the liposome preparations were made with a unique lipid mixture of eypc and ps with eypc / ps 90:10 mol / mol .",

    "buffer solution ( 2 ml , ph 7.4 , hepes 0.5 mm , edta 0.5 mm , temperature @xmath2 ) was added to the working chamber ( avoiding agitation ) .",
    "the voltage was gradually increased ( for more than two hours ) up to 1 vpp and maintained during 15 more minutes , before switching the ac field off .",
    "the guv were then ready for further use . in each preparation",
    "at least 10 guvs of diameter 50 - 80 @xmath1 m were available .",
    "we used a zeiss axiovert 200 m microscope , equipped with a charged - coupled device camera ( coolsnap hq ; photometrics , tucson , az ) .",
    "the experiments were computer - controlled using the metamorph software ( molecular devices , downington , pa ) . the morphological transformations and the dynamics of the membrane were followed by phase contrast microscopy .",

    ", its free - energy density @xmath13 can be written as the sum of the free - energy densities of the two monolayers , which will be noted @xmath22 and @xmath23 . since the curvature @xmath15 is defined on the bilayer midsurface ,",

    "furthermore , we assume that the two monolayers have the same lipid composition before the onset of the instability , so that they have identical tensions and bending rigidities .",

    "@xcite , we call @xmath45 the fraction of the lipids of the external monolayer that are chemically modified by the local ph increase in the experiment .",

    "we will study the differences between them in more detail in sec .",
    "[ comp ] .",
    "it is interesting to determine the relative importance of the two above - mentioned mechanisms in a budding instability . for this , let us first compare the relative variation of the spontaneous curvature @xmath93 and the relative variation of the plane - shape equilibrium density @xmath94 induced by the chemical modification in monolayer @xmath36 . as explained in sec .",

    "[ sec_discussion ] ) . we have thus varied the upper bound of this time interval from about 3 to 7 seconds , and taken the extremal values thus obtained for @xmath206 ( and @xmath207 ) as the bounds of the uncertainty interval over @xmath206 ( and @xmath207 ) .",

    "besides , our results seem to indicate that guv 1 has a somewhat smaller intermonolayer coefficient friction @xmath164 than guv 2 , which was not expected , since all of our vesicles should have the same lipid composition , and @xmath164 should only depend on this composition .",
    "however , the existence of small composition variations in the experiments can not be totally excluded .    while the intermonolayer friction coefficient @xmath164 has been deduced from @xmath206 , which gives the longest timescale of the relaxation ( a few seconds ) , the vesicle tension @xmath16 has to be extracted from @xmath207 , which corresponds to a shorter timescale .",

    "first of all , given that the timescale of the diffusion of the hydroxide ions is comparable to the timescale of the relaxation of the deformation ( see sec .

    "however , it would be necessary to make strong assumptions on the way the hydroxide ions are injected and diffuse .",
    "another point of our model that could be improved lies in _ ( sh@xmath155 ) _ : in practice , the deformation of the vesicle is not single - mode , so it would be an improvement to study the evolution of an initial deformation with a complete fourier expansion .",
    "this is work in progress , but given the uncertainty on the spatio - temporal dependence of @xmath59 in the present experiments , it is difficult to gain further insight , and at the moment , the one - mode approximation is the best we can do . besides , we have used the initial value of the width of the deformation @xmath222 to calculate the characteristic wavevector @xmath221 .",
    "however , in reality , this width can change in time during the instability , due to dispersion , which does not occur for our theoretical single - mode deformation . in order to have an idea of the importance of this phenomenon , we have digitized the vesicle shape for all the experimental points in one `` pulse '' experiment , and calculated the width @xmath222 for each of these points , using the method in sec .",

    "[ time_evol],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we can see that @xmath222 is not constant during the instability .",
    "its variation is about 90% during the five second interval used for our fits .",
    "nevertheless , it remains nearly constant just after the end of the injection before increasing : using the initial value of @xmath222 was thus the best thing we could do while keeping a constant @xmath222 .    in order to determine @xmath16 from these experiments",

    "another further experimental improvement would be to use larger vesicles , and to make the injection even more local than in the present work , so as to be closer to the assumptions of the model .",

    "both of these effects have been taken into account and compared . in our description of the dynamics of the instability , the intermonolayer friction plays a crucial part : it gives the longest timescale of the instability , as the monolayers are unable to slide with respect to each other on short timescales .    our model has been compared to the experiments by fitting the experimental data to the theoretical formula describing the height of the deformation as a function of time .",
    "the agreement between the experiments and the model is quite good .",
