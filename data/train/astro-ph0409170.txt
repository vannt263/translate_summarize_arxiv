    "further improvements and the quest for the nature of the dark energy requires an increased accuracy for distance determinations from 10 % to about 2 to 3 % ( weller & albrecht 2001 ) making evolutionary effects with redshift a main concern , and a a better understanding of the physics of sne  ia a requirement .",
    "there is general agreement that type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are the result of a thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate c / o white dwarf ( wd ) with a mass close to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "these scenarios allow to reproduce optical / infrared light curves ( lc ) and spectra of sne  ia reasonably well . nowadays ,",
    "we understand the basic , observational features .",
    "sne  ia appear rather homogeneous because nuclear physics determines the structure of the wd , the explosion , light curves and spectra : ( 1 ) the wd is supported by degenerate electron pressure , ( 2 ) the total energy production during the explosion is given by the release of thermonuclear energy , and ( 3 ) the light curves are powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath1 produced during the explosion to first order , the outcome hardly depends on details of the physics , the scenario , or the progenitor ( `` stellar amnesia '' ) .",

    ", consistency is also demanded for the treatment of hydrodynamics , rate equations , and radiation transport ( fig.1 ) .",
    "density structures require detailed hydrodynamics , low densities cause strong non - lte effects throughout the entire envelopes and the radiation field differs from a black body , chemical profiles are depth dependent , energy source and sink terms due to hydrodynamical effects and radioactive decays dominate throughout the photon decoupling region , and all physical properties are time - dependent because the energy diffusion time scales are comparable to the hydrodynamical expansion time scale ( hflich , 1995 ) .",

    "in spherical models , this quantity is often parameterized by a transition density @xmath11 .",
    "other properties produce a dispersion .",
    "e.g. changes in the progenitor , i.e. in main sequence mass @xmath12 and z , alter the explosion energy and @xmath1 mass , respectively , but , by enlarge , along the @xmath13 and @xmath14 relations ( hflich et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "however , the diversity in progenitors cause an intrinsic dispersion in b - v of @xmath15 which , in practice , seriously hampers the corrections by interstellar reddening .",

    "2004 ) . in extensive studies , we investigated the influence of the central density of the wd , the ignition process , and metallicities ( which are expected to change with time ) ( hflich et al .",

    "2002 , see also timmes et al .",
    "pre - conditioning of the wd is a key to understand the diversity of sneia .",
    "metallicity will effect the statistical sample because it changes the life times and radii of stars and , consequently , the binary system with mass overflow , and the physics of individual objects . a change of metallicity or progenitor ms mass effects both the progenitor evolution , wd structure and the observable lc shapes simultaneously , and the combined effect must be considered when comparing to observations . as can be seen from fig .",
    "the change of the initial fe changes the core he burning during the stellar evolution which determines the c / o ratio , whereas the @xmath16 directly effects the explosive nuclear burning by shifting the nuclear statistical equilibrium slightly away from @xmath1 .",
    "the former effect alters the energetics of the explosion ( explosion energy ) whereas the latter changes the energy gain by radioactive decay of @xmath1 which powers the lcs . for low metallicities ,",
    "the influence of the energetics dominates the changes in the lc shape .",
    "it causes a change @xmath17 of the rise - time for a given decline ratio and , thus , an offset @xmath18 in the brightness decline relation by @xmath19 .",
    "these results do not ( ! ) imply that all processes involved are spherical in nature but they are a result of the stellar amnesia mentioned above , i.e. the properties depend mostly on integral quantities and basic nuclear physics . despite the successes of spherical delayed detonation models",
    ", it becomes increasingly obvious that multidimensional effects are important towards a better understanding of sne  ia .",
    "- asymmetries in a sn  ia may be present for a variety of reasons . within the framework of the explosion of a massive wd , reasons and all seems to be realized .",
    "reasons include instabilities in the burning front ( khokhlov 1995 , 2001 , reinecke et al .",
    "2002 gamezo et al . 2003 ) , namely the deflagration phase , off - center detonations or the transitions from deflagration to detonation ( livne 1999 ) , rapid rotation of the wd , and interaction with the accretion disk and the companion star .",
    "whereas we have evidence for the existence of the latter effects , direct evidence is still elusive for the rt instabilities or , more precisely , such evidence has not been seen although it was expected ( figs . 4 & 6 ) .",
    "both from the remnants and the lack of strong polarization in thermonuclear supernovae , limited scattering in brightness , we can conclude that the envelopes have rather small global deviations from spherical geometry of the order of 5 to 20 % .",
    "for cosmology , deviations from sphericity will introduce a directional dependence of the luminosity of the order of about 4 - 6 % .",
