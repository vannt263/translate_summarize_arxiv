    "centaurus a ( ngc5128 , cen a ) is one of the closest active galaxies . well known as having a double radio lobe structure extending to @xmath5 , details in the radio jets have been mapped down to milliarcsecs .",
    "while its radio power is relatively modest , cen a , at a distance of only 3mpc ( tonry & schechter 1990 , ford et al .",
    "1989 ) , offers a unique opportunity to investigate in detail the smaller scale structures which surround and fuel the central power source .",
    "optical observations of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) usually classify them as seyfert 1 , seyfert 2 or starburst , with the seyfert types linked by the unified model ( antonucci 1993 ) to be the same intrinsic class of object but viewed at different angles to the line of sight .",
    "it has been proposed that a similar picture applies to radio - loud agns in which relativistic radio jets from the nucleus can extend in bipolar outflows out to scales of @xmath6pc .",
    "the collimation of these jets occurs within a scale @xmath7pc .",
    "the working model used to explain these phenomena consists of a hot accretion disk around a supermassive black hole , with a broad emission line region ( blr ) of a few parsecs close to the nucleus and contained within a much larger circumnuclear torus .",
    "a narrow emission line region ( nlr ) extends to tens to hundreds of parsecs . in the seyfert 1 model , the active nucleus",
    "is viewed at a line of sight close to the radio jet axis , such that the blr , nlr and active nucleus are observed directly .",
    "seyfert 2s , on the other hand , are aligned more edge - on such that the circumnuclear torus obscures the direct view of the blr and nucleus , and the radio jets are close to the plane of the sky .",
    "while starburst galaxies are powered by thermal rather than non - thermal nuclear processes , it is becoming increasingly recognized that there is a substantial overlap between starburst and seyfert galaxies , with many showing evidence of starburst regions surrounding a seyfert nucleus ( moorwood & oliva 1988 ) .",
    "cen a is classified as a seyfert 2 galaxy with a prominent warped dust lane which totally obscures the nuclear regions at optical wavelengths .",
    "the dust lane includes a population of young stars , and is considered to be the result of a merger @xmath8 years ago ( malin , quinn & graham 1983 ) which has led to a range of phenomena spanning most of the observable spectrum . because of lower dust extinction , near ir ( @xmath9@xmath10 m ) and longer wavelength radiation penetrates the foreground dust lane , giving a view into the circumnuclear torus and nlr . at @xmath11 m",
    "there is a point source coincident with the nucleus ( giles 1986 ) , but the emission becomes extended along the radio jet axis ( p.a .",
    "= @xmath12 ) at shorter infrared wavelengths .",
    "joy et al .",
    "( 1991 ) described the @xmath13 m feature as the _ j_-band ` jet ' .",
    "previous authors have found a region of higher extinction on scales of @xmath1416 arcsec around the nucleus ; this has been attributed to a circumnuclear torus , but the exact orientation has been unclear .",
    "as expected , no broad lines have been found , consistent with the blr being fully obscured .",
    "polarisation at p.a.@xmath15 , parallel to the dust lane , was measured by bailey et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and packham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , along with a patch of polarisation just on the nucleus and perpendicular to the radio jet axis at p.a.@xmath16 .",
    "detailed radio studies show an fri ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) morphology with radio structure ranging from lobes extending to 300kpc , down to an unresolved point source of only 0.01pc in the nucleus ( schreier , burns & feigelson 1981 ; kellerman , zensus & cohen 1997 ) .",
    "jets at x - ray wavelengths follow the same axis as the radio jets , and the nucleus is variable in both radio and x - rays ( morini , anselmo & moltini 1989 ) .",
    "turner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have reported variability in the infrared , but this remains to be confirmed .",
    "we present an analysis of _ j _ ( @xmath17 m ) , _ h _ ( @xmath18 m ) and _ kn _",
    "( @xmath11 m ) images , and 0.9@xmath10 m spectra , of the nucleus of cen a , directed at revealing the structure and processes in the nuclear region .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and reduction .",
    "images and spectra are presented in section 3 , and section 4 discusses the observational results in the light of a model for the structure of the circumnuclear regions and the contribution of starburst processes to the infrared power .",
    ".log of observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ hliner ]    these results lend support to a model in which the h@xmath19 lines are generated on the inner edge of the circumnuclear torus by a combination of shock and x - ray heating .",
    "the unified model for agns ( antonucci 1993 ) predicts that in seyfert 2s , the h@xmath19 lines should be partially obscured by the gas and dust in the outer parts of the torus .",
    "the nuclear radiation does not penetrate to the outer regions of the torus , so the temperature is not high enough to excite h@xmath19 ; instead the emission is reprocessed and re - emitted in the fir . in seyfert 1s",
    ", the direct view of the inner parts of the torus would be expected to show the excited molecular hydrogen .",
    "kawara et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found h@xmath19 emission more strongly connected with seyfert 1s than seyfert 2s , as predicted by this model .",
    "however , if in a seyfert 2 galaxy the torus is tilted slightly towards our line of sight , the h@xmath19 from the inner back edge of the torus should be observable over the front rim of the torus ( alonso - herrero , ward & kotilainen 1996 ) .",
    "krolik & begelman ( 1988 ) claim to have made such h@xmath19 observations for several type 2 seyferts . as discussed below ( and in figure  [ torusb ] , from section 4.1 ) , the cen a circumnuclear torus appears to have a similar orientation , revealing the h@xmath19 from inside the torus .      in agns ,",
    "three main mechanisms have been put forward to explain [ feii ] production .",
    "firstly , starburst activity in or near the nucleus can excite iron , either in the cooling tails of snrs , in which case there should be a correlation between the [ feii ] emission and radio images , or through direct photoionisation by young ob stars in a starburst region . secondly , x - rays from the central source can photoionise parts of the nlr clouds .",
    "shocks induced by the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient medium is the third option for iron excitation , and predicts that the [ feii ] morphology should match that of the radio jets .    if [ feii ] is to originate from either shock or photoionisation processes in a circumnuclear starburst , it is first necessary to consider whether cen a has a composite seyfert / starburst nucleus .",
    "several papers have found trends in emission line ratios from studies of pure starbursts , composites and pure seyfert nuclei .",
    "moorwood and oliva ( 1988 ) found that the concurrent detection of h@xmath19 , [ feii ] and hi recombination lines was more probable in composite nuclei than in pure starbursts , with none of their pure seyferts exhibiting all three species .",
    "they further found the ratio of @xmath20 to be higher in composites than starbursts .",
    "[ feii]@xmath21 ratios overlap between the two groups , although colina ( 1993 ) found this ratio must be below 1.4 for pure starbursts . for cen a , this ratio is 2.6 ( @xmath22 ) , which makes pure starbursts unlikely , as expected .",
    "the h@xmath19 increase in composite nuclei reflects the additional excitation of h@xmath19 in the circumnuclear region by the agn as discussed in section 4.2.1 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath23[feii]@xmath24 from moorwood and oliva s ( 1988 ) sample was @xmath25 for composites and @xmath26 for hii / starbursts , with the current cen a spectra again clearly composite with a ratio of 0.73 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "furthermore , a well documented correlation exists between [ feii]@xmath28 and hi recombination lines from which puxley & brand ( 1994 ) found the mean values for the flux ratio [ feii]@xmath29 to be @xmath30 for starburst and @xmath31 for agn / composite galaxies respectively , leaving cen a clearly amongst the composites with a ratio of 0.74(@xmath32 ) .",
    "we now explore the likely origin of [ feii ] in cen a. photoionisation by hot stars is unlikely , because in photoionised gas iron is mostly in a higher ionisation state than fe@xmath33 so the [ feii ] lines are weak . fast shocks , however , leave fe singly ionised in their wake from the destruction of fe - rich interstellar grains .",
    "therefore [ feii ] is likely to originate from shocks either along the radio axis or associated with snrs in starbursts .",
    "several studies of starbursts and agns ( veilleux et al .",
    "1997 and refs therein ) have demonstrated a relationship between [ feii ] and radio emission in both classes of nucleus .",
    "hence , any model of [ feii ] generation may involve a process connected with the synchrotron emission .",
    "this supports a picture in which the radio jets induce fast shocks in the surrounding gas , with the line emission resulting from the ionised post - shock gas . to uphold this radio correlation in cen a",
    ", a starburst shock origin would require an as yet unsubstantiated association between the radio axis and the morphology of the starburst region .",
    "based on the nuclear spectrum , the [ feii ] in cen a is most likely generated in shocks from nuclear outflow along the jet axis , with the possibility of an additional starburst contribution .",
    "for consistency with the literature , the _ j_-band feature is referred to as a ` jet ' although the possible emission processes actually do not allow for an outflow of infrared - emitting material from the nucleus .",
    "the ` blue ' emission consists of a diffuse , approximately conical structure with three positions of interest marked in figure  [ jjet](a ) .",
    "the brightest feature , at a , which we refer to as the _ j_-band nucleus , is located 0.4 arcsec east of the _ kn_-band nucleus .",
    "b marks a patch of _ j _ emission stronger than the surrounding diffuse structure but weaker than the _",
    "j _ nucleus ; it is located 2.2 arcsec ne of the _ kn_-band nucleus and has some lateral extension .",
    "it is clear from overlays with the extinction map ( figure  [ jjet](b ) ) , that this patch sits just above the front rim of our model torus , and hence appears elongated perpendicular to the axis .",
    "b therefore marks the start of the observable portion of the jet , which then extends to the ne into region c. although b and c mark different portions of the same feature , b has enhanced emission relative to c , as the view just over the front rim of the torus includes a contribution from the inner edge of the far side of the torus .    in order to explore the processes responsible for the ` jet ' emission , we need to consider a , b and c separately .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on all three regions , with aperture diameters of 0.48 and 0.96 arcsec , chosen so the apertures did not overlap the adjacent regions .",
    "the two - colour plot in figure  [ j2col ] maps these points along with the previous aperture photometry for the _ kn_-band nucleus . as in figure  [ n2col ]",
    "typical colours for e and s0 galaxies are marked by an ellipse and vectors show the colours expected for each of the possible processes discussed below . while the _ j_-band nucleus has similar colours to the _ kn _ nucleus , as expected since it suffers the same extinction from the torus and dust lane , the b and c positions have colours",
    "progressively less affected by extinction and no significant hot dust component . as discussed above ,",
    "the hot dust cloud around the nucleus is less than 20pc ( 1.4 arcsec ) , and hence the _ j _ nucleus , offset from _",
    "k _ by 0.4 arcsec , is within the same hot dust region as the _ kn _ nucleus .",
    "the slight offset in position may be due to the smaller depth into the torus seen at _",
    "j_.    the ` jet ' in regions b and c , however , is clearly due to different processes .",
    "possible mechanisms for producing the jet include : ( a ) non - thermal synchrotron emission , ( b ) scattered light from the agn , ( c ) starlight from blue stars , ( d ) thermal dust emission , or ( e ) thermal gas emission ( hii ) . from figure  [ j2col ]",
    "it is clear that the colour of blue a0 stars eliminates ( c ) from being a significant contributor to the jet emission .",
    "although the two - colour plot does not rule out a contribution from synchrotron emission for b if it was in conjunction with dust extinction , polarisation images by bailey et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and packham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show no enhanced polarisation anywhere in the _",
    "j_-band ` jet ' region . furthermore",
    ", if the ` jet ' had a significant synchrotron component , we would expect there to be corresponding radio emission .",
    "a @xmath34 cm ( 1 arcsec resolution ) atca radio image ( morganti 1998 , private communication ) when overlaid on the _ j_-band image , shows no correlation between _ j_-band and radio emission within @xmath35 arcsec around the nucleus .",
    "gas , dust or hot electrons located just above the torus have the potential to scatter nuclear radiation towards the line of sight , thereby revealing a hidden blr ( e.g. in ngc1068 , pogge & de robertis 1993 ) .",
    "however , the lack of polarisation in the cen a ` jet ' precludes scattering of nuclear radiation as a significant contribution .",
    "this leaves the possibility of thermal emission from gas or dust .",
    "we can speculate that the b position in the two - colour plot , could be dust extinction plus a small hot dust emission component .",
    "alternatively , based on the c position , both b and c could include thermal gas emission contributing around 10 percent of the _ kn_-band flux .",
    "b has more extinction than c as it is closer to the highest extinction regions of the foreground dust lane .",
    "hot dust emission at a and a cone morphology are strong indicators of an ionisation cone , which traces ionising radiation from the nucleus collimated along the radio jet axis , ionising the nlr gas which reradiates in the infrared .",
    "the strongest circumstantial argument in favour of an ionisation cone is the conical morphology of the ` jet ' emission .",
    "such cones have been seen in several seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "those with radio jets and an obscuring torus , include ngc5728 ( wilson et al .",
    "1993 ; pogge 1989 ) , ngc1365 ( phillips et al . 1983 ; storchi - bergmann & bonatto 1991 ) , ngc4388 ( pogge 1988 ; 1989 ; corbin , baldwin & wilson 1988 ) , and ngc5252 ( wilson and tsvetanov 1994 ; tadhunter and tsvetanov 1989 ) .",
    "two mechanisms can collimate the radiation into a cone : firstly , the accretion disk and secondly , shadowing from the molecular torus . in both cases the strong correlation between the cone and radio jet axes seen in the objects listed above ( see wilson and tsvetanov 1994 , pogge 1989 ) , is easily explained . from the parameters of our simple model ( figure  [ torusb ] )",
    ", the torus itself could not be collimating the cone .",
    "however , the assumption of an elliptical cross section for the torus is most likely an over - simplification and in fact the torus could be thicker on the inside than the outside , which may collimate the cone without affecting the correspondence of the model with the observed torus .",
    "the cone opening angle adopted in the torus model was measured from figure  [ jjet](b ) to be @xmath36 , by extrapolating back to the nuclear position .",
    "for comparison , wilson and tsvetanov s ( 1994 ) sample of 11 ionisation cone galaxies showed a range of opening angles between 4092@xmath37 .",
    "an ionisation cone should exhibit an emission line spectrum characteristic of photoionisation by the nuclear source .",
    "although the current spectra do not include position c on the cone , a limited spectrum is available at b. when the positions of the off - nuclear spectra ( see section 3.2.3 and figure  [ slitprofile ] ) are overlaid on the extinction and _",
    "j_-band images in figure  [ slit ] , the differences in the east and west spectra become apparent as the west spectrum sits on the front of the torus like the nuclear spectrum , but the east position includes a contribution from the putative ionisation cone near b. although there will be some contamination from the nucleus to the east and west spectra , the differences are significant . it",
    "is not surprising , therefore , that the east spectrum measures less extinction ( section 3.2.3 ) , as the line emission is generated above the front rim of the torus . along the line of sight in the east spectrum position",
    "j _ cone in the foreground with the inside back edge of the circumnuclear torus behind . therefore , not only should the east spectrum have a contribution from ionisation lines along the radio jet axis as above , but the excited molecular hydrogen lines , coating the inner torus , should be included at higher extinction .",
    "the west spectrum has stronger [ feii ] and h@xmath19 like the nucleus as the west position includes scattered emission from the nucleus , inside the torus .",
    "longer wavelengths penetrate further and therefore should be generated deeper within an object .",
    "as the wavelength increases , the east spectrum more closely resembles the nuclear and west spectra , showing a strong correspondence with the nucleus for wavelengths longer than @xmath38 m .",
    "this trend is apparent in the line sections shown in figure  [ spec ] . in the east spectrum ,",
    "whilst undetected at shorter wavelengths , h@xmath19 lines are increasingly measurable at longer wavelengths .",
    "however , even the shorter wavelength [ feii ] line ( @xmath39 m ) is detected , suggesting that [ feii ] is generated from a shallower depth than the h@xmath19 lines . as the east position is above the front rim of the torus and",
    "hence suffers less extinction , if [ feii ] is excited along the radio jet axis the h@xmath19 may therefore originate on the inner back torus .",
    "the wavelength correspondence between the strong [ feii]@xmath40 m line and the _ j_-band filter ( @xmath17 m ) lends support to an ionisation cone that appears so strongly at _ j_-band . a fainter extension in the cone direction",
    "is also seen at _ h_-band ( figure  [ hjkimages ] ) .",
    "the [ feii]@xmath41 m line lies in the _ h _ filter and was detected but not measured ( see section  [ offnucresults ] ) .",
    "the [ feii ] lines do not confirm the ionisation cone , as they could be shock excited by shocks along the radio jet axis or shocks within small circumnuclear starburst regions inside the torus area .",
    "however , based on the morphology and colours of the _ j _ ` jet ' , it is most likely an ionisation cone of opening angle @xmath36 , length @xmath42pc ( 7 arcsec ) , extending ne from the nucleus along the radio jet axis . to test this ionisation cone model , a map of spectra across the proposed cone region and/or",
    "a narrow - band [ feii ] image should reveal the distribution of the [ feii ] emission .",
    "from _ j _ , _ h _ and _ kn_-band images and near - infrared spectra , a model of the cen a nuclear regions has been proposed consistent with the observations . by no means",
    "an exclusive solution , the model depends on the interpretation of the sudden change of extinction ne of the nucleus as defining the top of a torus .",
    "this leaves a picture which includes a point source nucleus at wavelengths longer than _",
    "k_-band , from which collimated radio jets are produced .",
    "the nucleus is partially obscured by a circumnuclear torus of outer diameter @xmath43pc and thickness @xmath44pc which is tilted @xmath45 from the line of sight , such that the inner back edge of the torus is seen over the front rim .",
    "scattering clouds surrounding the nucleus are shock excited by nuclear outflows , which heat the clouds to a depth of @xmath46pc .",
    "_ k_-band emission is generated in this hot dust and not directly from the nucleus which is only seen at longer wavelengths through more extinction .",
    "we speculate that radiation from the nucleus , collimated along the jet axis , produces a cone of hot ionised nlr gas with opening angle @xmath36 .",
    "reradiation from the cone , in the near - infrared , is preferentially at shorter wavelengths and accompanied by [ feii ] emission lines .",
