    "<S> it is consequently shown that the calculated band - gap energies follow _ qualitatively _ and _ quantitatively _ the same trend within the _ two _ approximations employed here , and the transition to the zero - gap state occurs at the _ same _ critical width of the van der waals gap .    </S>",

    "<S> the bitei band gap decreases with increasing pressure , and diminishes at a critical pressure @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies show that an inversion of valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) states occurs when the applied pressure @xmath1 exceeds @xmath0 , which marks a transition to the topological insulating phase.@xcite this means that the band gap reopens and increases at pressures higher than @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> it was therefore suggested that the topological phase transition is hindered by a structural phase transition.@xcite on the theoretical side , density - functional calculations have been employed to estimate @xmath0 , the reported values of which range from 1.7 to @xmath310 gpa owing to various types of approximations.@xcite it is crucial to have a reliable estimate of @xmath0 to see if the topological phase transition takes place before the structural phase transition occurs , which clearly depends critically on the accuracy of the equation of state ( eos ) . </S>",
    "<S> our recent investigation@xcite revealed that the inclusion of van der waals ( vdw ) interactions is necessary for a reliable and truly _ ab initio _ computation of the eos of bitei , which was not taken into account in the aforementioned calculations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we examine here the variation of the bitei band gap with pressure with the aid of dispersion - corrected density - functional ( pbe - d2 ) calculations using the functional of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite together with a semiempirical force field.@xcite in addition , we employ semilocal density - functional calculations using the pbesol@xcite functional for the purpose of comparison . </S>",

    "<S> in this structure , adjacent ( unary ) layers formed by bi , te , and i atoms stack along the @xmath6-axis , and the _ van der waals ( vdw ) gap _ exists in the vacuum region between the te and i layers . as will be clear below </S>",
    "<S> , our findings reveal the importance of the width of the vdw gap . </S>",
    "<S> thus we investigate the effect of pressure not only on the bitei band structure but also on the vdw gap . to this end , we carried out crystal - structure optimizations , for which the total energy was computed as function of the unit cell volume @xmath12 and the lattice parameter ratio @xmath13 , followed by band - structure calculations . for each value of the pair ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , the ionic positions were relaxed until the maximum value of residual forces on atoms was reduced to be smaller than 0.01 ev /  . </S>",

    "<S> the parameters used for the semiempirical ( van der waals ) force field@xcite were the same as in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that although we were inclined to employ a nonempirical van der waals density functional ( in lieu of the semiempirical force field ) such as the optb86b - vdw functional,@xcite we unfortunately found that the crystal structure of bitei was not adequately described by using the optb86b - vdw functional , as discussed in the appendix .    </S>",

    "<S> , the closure of the band gap at the critical pressure occurs within _ not only _ the pbesol _ but also _ pbe - d2 description , which reveals that the pressure variation of the band gap is _ not _ in correlation with that of @xmath13 . a comparative inspection of figs .  </S>",

    "<S> the slight increase of the layer thickness as a result of compression was observed in tis@xmath59 , viz . a layered material with a vdw gap , which is associated with an increase of the electronic charge in the interlayer region , indicating enhanced _ metallic _ rather than van der waals bonding between the layers.@xcite in accordance with this </S>",

    "<S> the latter is also supported by the fact that the results of pbesol , rather than pbe - d2 , calculations are in excellent agreement with the measured pressure variation of the lattice parameter @xmath6 , cf . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 ( ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath60 , the effect of pressure on @xmath6 is manifested primarily ( solely ) as the compression of the vdw gap according to the pbesol ( pbe - d2 ) calculations . </S>",

    "<S> this means that the interlayer metallic bonding becomes stronger as @xmath55 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in @xmath65 , compared to that in @xmath66 , is more pronounced in the low - pressure regime , as seen in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , the transition to the zero - gap state occurs at a relatively lower ( higher ) pressure within the pbesol ( pbe - d2 ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why @xmath38 is smaller than @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> the band gap diminishes when the width @xmath55 of the vdw gap is reduced to a critical value @xmath67 , which is marked by the horizontal dashed lines in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is remarkable that @xmath67 takes practically the same value in _ both _ pbesol and pbe - d2 approaches , i.e. , @xmath68  . </S>",
    "<S> hence the transition to the zero - gap state occurs at the _ same _ critical thickness @xmath67 according to the _ two _ approximations ( pbesol and pbe - d2 ) employed in this study . </S>",
    "<S> it is also striking that the pbesol and pbe - d2 calculations yield almost _ identical _ @xmath63 in the vdw gap region for zero pressure as well as for @xmath64 , which is discernible in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> thus the pbesol and pbe - d2 approaches that are in conflict to some degree ( as pointed out above ) yield _ consistent _ predictions concerning the electronic structure and the interlayer metallic bonding in bitei under pressure . </S>",
