    "the supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive extension beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is important to detect the signals of susy not only in the high - energy region but also in low - energy experiments .    in the high - energy physics ,",
    "finding higgs bosons is one of the main objectives for both of the sm and susy . as a common feature of susy models",
    "@xcite , the higgs boson mass is smaller than one in the sm .",
    "thus , the search for the light neutral higgs boson is regarded as a decisive test to give an evidence for susy that can be performed at present or in the next generation of high - energy colliders .",
    "the sm higgs , in contrast to the higgs boson in the standard model @xmath2 is expressed as `` the sm higgs '' throughout this paper . ]",
    "mass is currently restricted by lep @xcite as follows :    @xmath3    on the other hand , the mssm lightest neutral higgs is constrained as @xcite :    @xmath4    @xmath5 has been expected less than about 130 ( gev ) in many susy models theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , some of the parameters in such susy models have been assumed loosely in almost analyses . in this paper , we show the allowed region of the parameters in more reliable way to be consistent with the low - energy precise physics such as the measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment .    the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ( g-2 ) of the muon , defined as @xmath6 for convention , is one of the most precisely measured quantities in the low - energy particle physics .",
    "the world sum average , dominated by the recent measurements of the muon ( g-2 ) collaboration at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite , reads ,    @xmath7    the difference between the experiment and the theoretical prediction in the sm of the muon g-2 is currently @xcite ,    @xmath8    @xmath9    where , @xmath10 and @xmath11 mean the kinds of the hadronic contributions to the muon g-2 based on @xmath10 and @xmath11 cross sections , respectively .",
    "this inconsistency between @xmath10 and @xmath11-based values stems from their different cross sections @xcite .",
    "as eqs.([eq : aepm ] ) and ( [ eq : atau ] ) imply , the muon g-2 in the sm is slightly but significantly lower than the experimental results @xcite .",
    "thus , we think of all the @xmath12 scale difference of @xmath13 between the experimental results of the muon g-2 and its theoretical prediction in the sm ,    @xmath14    as the contributions of susy effects , in this paper .    as a realistic susy model ,",
    "the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) scenario @xcite is adopted in this paper .",
    "this scenario is a mechanism of susy breaking via the super - weyl anomaly .",
    "the amsb models have four important parameters @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath0 , sgn(@xmath18 ) @xmath19 , where , @xmath16 stands for the gravitino mass corresponding to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the auxiliary field for breaking susy at near the planck scale .",
    "@xmath17 denotes the bulk mass and introduced to avoid the sleptons being tachyonic .",
    "@xmath0 is defined as the ratio between vevs of the two higgs doublets as usual .",
    "sgn(@xmath18 ) means the sign of the higgs mixing parameter . for more detail of amsb models ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to estimate the upper bound of the higgs mass by restricting the allowed parameter region in amsb models from precisely measured muon g-2 .",
    "in amsb models , the soft susy breaking masses in the diagonal parts of the mass matrices of each scalar particles are given as follows @xcite :    @xmath20    with    @xmath21    where , the index @xmath22 indicates the generation . @xmath23",
    "( @xmath24=1 , 2 , and 3 ) denotes the gauge coupling constant , and @xmath25 ( @xmath26=@xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath11 ) stands for the yukawa coupling constant of top , bottom , and tau , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is the kronecker s delta .",
    "@xmath17 is the bulk mass introduced as the non - anomaly mediated contribution in order to keep the squared slepton masses positive .    in general",
    ", the contributions of the bulk mass are not universal among the particles , therefore , the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 can be different from one another .",
    "however , in the _ minimal _ amsb ( mamsb ) model @xcite , they are universal and normalized as :    @xmath37    the mass relations , eq.([eq : m2q ] ) to ( [ eq : m2hd ] ) , are renormalization group ( rg ) invariant except the bulk mass terms proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "since the smaller yukawa couplings are neglected , the bulk mass terms are running only in the third generation .",
    "when @xmath0 is enough small , only the top yukawa coupling is effective .",
    "however , if @xmath0 is large , not only the top but also the bottom yukawa coupling is influential .",
    "thus , we put both of these two contributions into the rg part of the third generation of the mass relations @xcite :    @xmath38    with    @xmath39    @xmath40    where , @xmath41 s are rge running parts of the bulk mass terms .",
    "the initial values of these parameters are obviously ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) = ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) . we evaluate these contributions numerically . in our framework , @xmath17 is introduced at the gut scale of the gauge coupling constants @xmath52 ( gev ) @xcite .",
    "the rg - variable @xmath27 is dimensionless and defined as @xmath53 with the energy scale @xmath54 .",
    "additionally , in the gaugino sector , we take into account the next - to - leading order radiative corrections and the weak scale threshold correction @xcite .",
    "by making use of the routine _ feynhiggs _ @xcite , we calculate the higgs mass up to the full 2-loop level . as the corrections to the higgs potential ,",
    "up to 1-loop order of the top and bottom corrections @xcite are taken into account .",
    "the higgs mixing parameter @xmath18 and the bilinear coupling constant b of the higgs potential are given by following equations :    @xmath55    @xmath56    where , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the higgs mass parameters given by eqs.([eq : m2hu ] ) and ( [ eq : m2hd ] ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath59 , ( i=1,2 , and 3 ) imply the 1-loop correction terms @xcite .",
    "the positivity of @xmath60 certifies the appropriate shape of the higgs potential .",
    "sgn(@xmath18 ) , the sign of @xmath18 is fixed to positive ( see subsection 3.1 ) . moreover , cp - odd higgs mass is also corrected @xcite up to 1-loop order with top and bottom contributions . the theoretical value of the muon g-2 in amsb models is evaluated up to 1-loop order both of the chargino and neutralino contributions @xcite .",
    "we assume that the cp - violating phase effect is negligible .      in this subsection",
    ", the allowed parameter areas on the @xmath61 plane @xcite are estimated in mamsb model given by eq.([eq : cmin ] ) .",
    "they are shown in figs .",
    "1 . note that @xmath62 is redefined as @xmath63 for convenience .",
    "we fixed sgn(@xmath18 ) to positive , because we find no region on the parameter space with negative @xmath18 as far as @xmath62 is positive . in figs . 1 ,",
    "the left hand sides are excluded by the experimental limits of the squark and slepton masses @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the lower regions are restricted from the higgs potential condition given by eq.([eq : myu2 ] ) , and the mass limits of the charginos and neutralinos @xcite .",
    "the contours of the higgs mass are illustrated by the thin solid curves .",
    "the susy contributions of g-2 are drawn with the thick solid curves for @xmath64=50 , 40 , 30 , 20 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "once reliable @xmath64 like eq.([eq : aepm ] ) is given by the experiments , only a small region of the corresponding narrow belt is allowed as the parameter space . in another words , the allowed parameter space on @xmath61 plane is strictly restricted from the experiments .",
    "the upper bound of the higgs mass is evaluated in the allowed parameter space where is strictly restricted from the muon g-2 in this subsection . in the first step , we scan on the allowed parameter region constrained by the g-2 analysis in the previous subsection . in the next step ,",
    "we find out the parameter point to maximize the higgs mass bound on the allowed region . in the last step ,",
    "we plot those maximal values of the higgs mass bound as functions of @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "additionally , the lower bound is also obtained in the similar procedure .",
    "for instance , @xmath65 gives @xmath66 ( gev ) , or @xmath67 ( gev ) is derived when @xmath68 .      in this subsection ,",
    "other possibilities rather than the minimal model eq.([eq : cmin ] ) of the bulk mass contributions are considered . since",
    "naive amsb models have a common serious problem that the squares of the slepton masses are negative , several scenarios are proposed to recover this defect .",
    "one of them is the gaugino assisted amsb model @xcite .",
    "this model contains the coefficients of the bulk mass as follows :    @xmath69    another proposal is the extra u(1 ) model @xcite , and this model suggests following conditions :    @xmath70    we also analyze these two models in the similar way to the previous subsection .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the upper bounds of the higgs mass in these models in the same procedure with the previous subsection .",
    "nonetheless , we can not find so large difference on the upper bounds among these models as shown in fig .",
    "more generally , the coefficients can be shifted freely from 1 as far as the bulk mass terms certify the positivity of the squared scalar masses . in order to evaluate the effects on the higgs mass bound of their free shifts from 1 , we move one of @xmath71 , or @xmath36 from 1 ( and",
    "all of the others are kept equal to 1 ) . @xmath72 and @xmath64=10 are fixed , because this condition is the strictest to make the upper bound of the higgs mass largest . as fig .",
    "3 shows , the coefficients except @xmath33 and @xmath34 give not so large contribution to the upper bound of the higgs mass .",
    "here is a note on the @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we found in our preliminary stage that their shifts appear to be sensitively increasing the upper bound if they are less than @xmath73 .",
    "however , we also find their sensitivities are canceled with the conditions on the mass parameters of the other scalars not to acquire the vevs as the charge and color breaking @xcite .",
    "therefore , the upper bound of the higgs mass is not so increasing by the free shift of @xmath30 or @xmath31 . the shifts of @xmath33 and @xmath34 from 1 contribute only to decrease the upper bound as shown in fig .",
    "3 . note that @xmath33 and @xmath34 must be positive because these bulk mass terms are introduced to make the squared slepton masses positive .     + as the result",
    ", we conclude that @xmath74 ( gev ) in almost amsb models for all of @xmath7560 .",
    "we estimate the upper bound of the higgs mass in several anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking models .",
    "consequently , we find @xmath74 ( gev ) in amsb models . heretofore , the upper bound of the higgs mass has been estimated by loosely assuming some of the susy parameters .",
    "however , we achieve to confine the allowed parameter space into the restricted area on the @xmath61 plane , and estimate the upper bound without assuming the parameters except @xmath0 by making use of the restrictions from recent muon g-2 measurements . therefore , we obtain a reliable estimation on the upper bound .",
    "needless to say , @xmath76 ( gev ) as the upper bound of the higgs mass is sufficiently small at present or in the next generation of the high - energy colliders .",
    "we hope to be found the higgs boson in the near future .",
