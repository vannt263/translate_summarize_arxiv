    "it is generally accepted that under extreme conditions ( high density and /or temperature ) hadronic matter undergoes two phase transitions , characterized respectively by deconfinement and restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the qcd vacuum would then be described by a weakly interacting gas of massless quarks and gluons .",
    "major theoretical and experimental efforts have been dedicated to heavy - ion physics looking for signatures of the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "special attention has also been given to neutron stars , which provide a natural laboratory to study hadronic matter at high densities .",
    "theoretical concepts on the behavior of matter at high densities have been mainly developed from model calculations .",
    "the nambu - jona - lasinio [ njl]@xcite type models have been extensively used over the past years to describe low energy features of hadrons and also to investigate restoration of chiral symmetry with temperature or density @xcite .",
    "studies of flavor asymmetric matter at high densities are also motivated by the interest in investigating the behavior of mesons . as a matter of fact @xcite the charge multiplets of mesons , that are degenerated in vacuum or in symmetric matter ( @xmath3 ) are expected to have a splitting in flavor asymmetric matter . in particular , the masses of kaons ( antikaons ) would increase ( decrease ) with density and a similar effect would occur for @xmath4 and @xmath5 in neutron matter .",
    "a slight raising of the @xmath6 mass and a lowering of the @xmath7 mass @xcite seems to be compatible with the analysis of data on kaonic atoms @xcite and with the results of kaos and fopi collaborations at gsi @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the driving mechanism for the mass splitting is attributed mainly to the selective effects of the pauli principle , although , in the case of @xmath7 , the interaction with the @xmath8 resonance plays a significant role as well , at least as low densities are concerned @xcite .",
    "a model aiming at describing hadronic behavior in the medium should account for the great variety particle - hole excitations that the medium can exhibit , some of them with the same quantum numbers as the hadrons under study @xcite .",
    "it has been established , within the framework of njl models , the presence , in flavor asymmetric media , of low energy pseudoscalar modes , which are excitations of the fermi sea @xcite .",
    "such studies were carried out in quark matter simulating nuclear matter @xmath9 , for charged kaons , and neutron matter without beta equilibrium , for charged pions .",
    "the role of the t hooft interaction was not taken into account in the last case .",
    "the combined effect of density and temperature , as well as the effect of vector interaction , was discussed for the case of charged kaons .",
    "@xcite . only densities below @xmath10",
    "were considered .",
    "the aim of this work is to explore the high density region ( @xmath11 ) of quark matter simulating neutron matter in weak equilibrium , having in mind the study of the behavior of kaonic ( charged and neutral ) and pionic ( charged ) excitations .",
    "the work is carried out in the framework of the su(3 ) njl model .",
    "since for high densities the quarks are supposed to be deconfined the lack of confinement of njl model is not a drawback in this region .",
    "we work in a flavor su(3 ) njl type model with scalar - pseudoscalar pieces and a determinantal term , the t hooft interaction , which breaks the @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "we use the following lagrangian : @xmath13 \\\\[4pt ]   & + & g_d\\,\\ , \\{\\mbox{det}\\,[\\bar q\\,(\\,1\\,+\\,\\gamma_5\\,)\\,q\\ , ] + \\mbox{det}\\,[\\bar q\\,(\\,1\\,-\\,\\gamma_5\\,)\\,q \\,]\\ , \\ } \\label{1 } \\\\   &   &   \\end{array } \\label{eq : lag}\\ ] ] the model parameters , the bare quark masses @xmath14 , the coupling constants and the cutoff in three - momentum space , @xmath15 , are fitted to the experimental values of the masses of pseudoscalar mesons and @xmath16 . here",
    "we use the same parameterization as @xcite , @xmath17 mev , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 mev and @xmath21 mev .",
    "the six quark interaction can be put in a form suitable to use the bosonization procedure ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath22\\ ] ]    with : @xmath23 .",
    "the usual procedure to obtain a four quark effective interaction from this six quark interaction is to contract one bilinear @xmath24 .",
    "then , from the two previous equations , an effective lagrangian is obtained :    @xmath25 + \\,p_{ab}[(\\,\\bar q \\,i\\,\\gamma_5\\,\\lambda^a\\ , q\\,)\\,(\\,\\bar q \\,i\\,\\gamma_5\\,\\lambda^b\\ , q\\,)\\,],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where : @xmath26    by using the usual methods of bosonization one gets the following effective action : @xmath27    in order to introduce medium effects , we use the thermal green functions in the standard way @xcite and restrict ourselves to @xmath28 .",
    "the following gap equations are obtained :    @xmath29    with @xmath30 cyclic and @xmath31 are the quark condensates .",
    "the poles in the kaon propagator are obtained from the condition @xmath32 with :    @xmath33i_{2}(\\omega))\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the excitation energy , which , for kaons at rest is equal to @xmath36 and the integrals are given by :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath39e_{u}}dk + \\int_{\\lambda _ { s}}^{\\lambda } \\frac{k^{2}}{[(e_{s}-\\omega)^{2}-e_{u}^{2}]e_{s}}dk\\right\\}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar expressions are obtained for @xmath40 , by replacing @xmath41 and for @xmath42 , by replacing @xmath43 .",
    "at variance with @xcite , we consider here the case of asymmetric quark matter with strange quarks in chemical equilibrium maintained by weak interactions and with charge neutrality , by imposing the following constraints on the chemical potentials of quarks and electrons and on its densities :        as discussed by several authors , this version of the njl model exhibits a first order phase transition @xcite . as shown in @xcite , by using a convenient parameterization the model may be interpreted as having a mixing phase  droplets of light @xmath46 quarks with a density @xmath47 surrounded by a non - trivial vacuum  and , above the critical density , a quark phase with partially restored chiral symmetry . as a matter of fact , the energy per particle of the quark system has two minimum , corresponding to the zeros of the pressure ( see fig .",
    "1-a ) ) , the minimum at @xmath47 being an absolute minimum .",
    "the dynamical quark masses and chemical potentials are plotted in fig .",
    "1-b ) as functions of @xmath48 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , chiral symmetry is partially restored in the su(2 ) sector , the @xmath49 quarks masses decreasing sharply .",
    "an important point to be noticed is that , due to the t hooft contribution in the gap equations , the mass of the strange quark decreases smoothly and becomes lower than the chemical potential at densities above 3.8@xmath50 , which we will denote from now on as @xmath51",
    ". a more pronounced decrease is then observed , which is due to the presence of @xmath52 quarks in this regime . as it will be discussed below",
    ", this fact is related to a change in the behavior of different observables , as compared to the region of lower densities . at @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "1-b ) ) the difference between the chemical potentials @xmath54 has a maximum and , as the density increases there is a tendency to the restoration of flavor symmetry that can be seen as well in quark densities ( fig .",
    "1-c ) ) and mesonic masses ( fig .",
    "let us analyze the results for the masses of @xmath55 and for @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "2 a)-c ) ) . in order to understand these results ,",
    "it is useful to look for the limits of the dirac and of the fermi sea continua of @xmath57 excitations with the quantum numbers of the mesons under study .",
    "they can be obtained by inspection of the meson dispersion relations ( looking for the limits of the regions of poles in the integrals @xmath58 , eq .",
    "[ i_2 ] ) and are plotted in fig .",
    "2 a ) and b ) ( dashed point lines ) : @xmath59 is the lower limit of the dirac continuum , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 are the upper and lower limits of the fermi sea continuum . we do not show the corresponding limits for the pions because , in the range of densities studied , the pion modes remain outside the continuum .    as usual ,",
    "two kinds of solutions for mesons masses may be found , corresponding to excitations of the dirac sea modified by the presence of the medium , and to excitations of the fermi sea , respectively ; however there are significant differences in their behavior at low and high densities . concerning the dirac sea excitations , we observe the expected splitting between multiplets : the increase of the masses of @xmath62 with respect to those of @xmath63 is due to fermi blocking and is more pronounced for kaons than for pions because there are @xmath64 and @xmath65 quarks in the fermi sea and therefore there are repulsive effects due to the pauli principle acting on @xmath5 .",
    "one notices also that at the critical density , @xmath66 the antikaons enter in the dirac continuum and became resonances , a behavior already observed in @xcite .",
    "the new findings are that at @xmath67 there is a sharp increase of @xmath68 and decrease of @xmath69 and the antikaons turn again in bound states and , while at low densities the splitting increases with density , at high densities it decreases and the modes show a tendency to become degenerated again .",
    "below the lower limit of the fermi sea continuum there are low bound states , denoted by the subscript @xmath70 , with quantum numbers of @xmath71 , respectively , which are particle - hole excitations of the fermi sea . in the last case",
    "the low energy mode only exists up to @xmath72 .",
    "analysis of the energy weighted sum rules allows to calculate the strength located in each mode @xcite .",
    "the sum of the contributions of the three discrete solutions ( dashed curves in fig .",
    "3 ) deviates from 1 as the density increases , indicating that the modes of the continuum became more relevant with increasing density , a behavior already found in @xcite .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "3 that above @xmath51 the lower energy modes are less coupled to the quarks and its strength decrease , which means that they become less relevant and that the opposite occurs for the antikaons that excitations of the dirac sea .",
    "it is a well known feature in many - body physics that the fermi sea continuum of excitations induces attractive correlations below its lower limit and repulsive above the upper limit @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "2- a)-b ) , this continuum becomes very narrow above @xmath51 , which explains the behavior mentioned above .",
    "finally , we remark that those low energy modes only appear associated to a first order phase transition , as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "we do not observe kaon condensation , probably due to the simplicity of the model .",
    "in fact , the model , in its present form , does not allow to consider color superconductivity , which is though to play a significant role on kaons .",
    "on the other side , our treatment is the leading order calculation in the inverse number of colors , @xmath73 , which means that we use the hartree approximation to calculate the energy of the quark system and rpa to calculate the meson masses . as pointed out by several authors ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations due to meson - like excitations are expected to be relevant for calculation of the quark masses and certainly will have effects in the eos .",
    "this study can be an useful starting point to investigations along theses lines .",
