    "the study of the stellar populations and the distribution of metallicities plays an important role in our understanding of the star formation history of the galaxies .",
    "their stellar populations are expected to be more complex than those of , for example , globular clusters , which are thought to be composed of a single stellar population .",
    "in fact , burstein _ et al . _ ( 1984 ) found differences when comparing colors and spectroscopic features of globular clusters with galaxies .",
    "key parameters in the interpretation of the observed colors and the line - strengths are the metallicity and the age .",
    "the problem is that even in the simplest unresolved stellar systems their effects are very difficult to separate using only colors ( oconnell 1986 , renzini 1986 , buzzoni _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) .    using colors together with absorption lines",
    "more accurate conclusions can be drawn .",
    "although every absorption line strength is dependent on different kinds of stars , in principle it should be possible to determine average metallicities or ages by carefully selecting features which more sensitive to the metallicity and others which are more sensitive to the age ( e.g. worthey _ et al .",
    "however the abundances of some elements may well evolve differently from those of others ( e.g. @xmath3-enhancement ) , and the conversion of ages and metallicities through models to observed colors and indices may be not unique due to problems in e.g. stellar evolution theory . finally , the large velocity broadening in giant elliptical galaxies implies that only the strongest lines can be used to obtain physical information from their spectra .    in the process of understanding the stellar population of early - type galaxies we first developed a new spectrophotometric model , which can be used to interpret observed colors and absorption lines of galaxies ( vazdekis _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the model is based on the latest improvements in stellar evolution theory and on the most recent stellar libraries . instead of studying a large sample of galaxies using a few lines indices , as has been done before ( e.g. worthey _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , gonzalez 1993 ) , we preferred to obtain high quality observations of three representative early - type galaxies ( two giant ellipticals and the bulge of the sombrero galaxy ) , but in many colors and absorption lines , and to make very detailed fits to each index , to understand better global ages and metallicities , and also to follow the abundances of individual elements .",
    "such analysis now is possible , since we could calibrate our observations using the large sample of stars from the extended lick - system ( worthey _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) hereafter wfgb ) .    in this paper",
    "we have applied our spectrophotometric population synthesis model following both the single - age single - metallicity and the chemical evolutionary approaches .",
    "we address here the problem of whether the conclusions we obtain depend on the stellar population synthesis method we use . in the end",
    "we find that the use of many indices does yield interesting information , and we show that we can learn more than by using only a few indices , as has been done in the past . at the same time we study the stellar population gradients in the three galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we explain our observations and the method we use to derive the line - strengths . in section  3",
    "we fit our population synthesis model and discuss the results obtained by fitting the data . finally in section  4",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "long - slit spectra of three well know early - type galaxies were obtained with the isis spectrograph on the 4.2 m wht in march , 1995 , at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma .",
    "the spectra were taken using both arms of the instrument , with a large format tek windowed to @xmath4 pixels , each with a size of @xmath5 ccd chip . in the _ blue _ we used a grating of @xmath6 giving a sampling of @xmath7 while in the _ red _ we used a @xmath8 grating giving a sampling of @xmath9 .",
    "our spectra were taken in the range @xmath10 .",
    "this configuration allowed us to cover almost the whole set of the absorption features contained in wfgb in addition to some uv features as defined in pickles ( 1985 ) .",
    "in fact , in the blue arm we covered the range 3700 to 4500  @xmath11 , while in the red arm we covered the range 4800 to 6300  @xmath12 .",
    "we could not observe the ca4455 , fe4531 and fe4668 features because they fall in the crossover region of the dichroic .",
    "the measured resolution was @xmath13 in the blue and @xmath14 in the red spectra .",
    "we also lost the tio@xmath15 since this index falls at the limit of the range covered .",
    "a set of stars of the sample of wfgb was also observed to calibrate our line - strength measurements .",
    "we positioned the slit on the major axis for ngc  4472 , at @xmath16 for ngc  3379 ( the major axis is at @xmath17 , see peletier _",
    "1990a ) and on the minor axis for the sombrero galaxy .",
    "the exposure times were @xmath18 for both frames .",
    "all data reduction was done with the iraf software package .",
    "the first step was subtracting the _ bias _ value calculated from the unilluminated portion of each frame .",
    "after this we flat - fielded using tungsten lamp exposures .",
    "next , the spectra were wavelength calibrated using cuar+cune calibration lamp exposures . the obtained pixel scale was @xmath19 @xmath20 for the blue and @xmath21 @xmath22 for the red spectra .",
    "the following step was the _ sky subtraction _ , for which the outer parts of each galaxy frame ( chosen at approximately @xmath23 from the center of the galaxy ) were averaged to produce a mean sky spectrum , which then was subtracted from each frame .",
    "the last step is the elimination of pixels affected by _ cosmic rays _ in each frame .",
    "we need a well - defined way to assign values to the strengths of features at different radii in the galaxy . for this purpose",
    "we used the expanded lick - system ( wfgb ) . here some indices ( the atomic features ) are defined as equivalent widths and some ( the molecular bands ) as ratios of line - depth to continuum in magnitudes and we have maintained these definitions . to measure these line - strength indices along the major axis we had to de - redshift each feature and the continuum on each side of it using the recession velocity corresponding to each spectrum . to calculate the rotation curve",
    "the spectra at each radius were cross - correlated with the observed spectrum of a stellar velocity standard star which looks most like the galaxy ( with spectral type k iii , see section  2.3.1 ) .",
    "this method is described in bottema ( 1988 ) , following the paper of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "then we calculated the indices by co - adding a sufficient number of spectra in the spatial direction , so that a satisfactory continuum level was reached across the whole wavelength range .",
    "more details about the indices can be found in wfgb and burstein _ et al . _ ( 1984 ) .",

    "are the fact that the instrument we used ( isis ) has a different spectral response , the fact that wfgb did not flux - calibrate their stars and the higher resolution of our data ( @xmath29 in the blue spectra and @xmath30 in the red spectra ) compared to theirs ( @xmath31 ) . while the effect of a different instrumental response is almost negligible in the narrow indices it is important in the broader ones such as mg@xmath15 since both the index itself and the two pseudocontinua cover a wide range in wavelength . on the other hand",
    "the effect of having a higher resolution is important only in the narrower indices , which are affected in the same way as by the velocity dispersion broadening .",
    "therefore , to transform our indices to the expanded lick - system we first pre - broadened both spectra , the galaxy and the reference stars , so that to match the resolution of the lick - system .",
    "next we compared the thus obtained line - strength measurements of our stars with those given in wfgb to find an empirical average correction constant for each feature ( see table  1 ) . in particular , the stars used for this conversion were hr  3461 ( k0 iii ) , hr  4521 ( k3 iii ) and hr  4932 ( g8 iii ) ( see for details wfgb ) .",
    "we attribute the large correction factor found for the fe4383 feature to the fact that its right - hand pseudocontinuum falls at the edge of our observed spectra , entering the cross - over wavelength region of the dichroic used in the observations .",
    "the large correction constant of ca4227 is mainly due to the fact that this line is weak and the number of stars used for the conversion is small . as expected , we see that the most important corrections constants are those obtained for the molecular features .      to correct the measured indices for instrumental resolution and velocity dispersion of the galaxy we used the spectra of a few k giants of the sample of wfgb to calibrate their effects on the galaxy indices in the same way as has been done before by e.g. davies _ et al . _",
    "an auto - correlation of the central spectrum of each galaxy gave its corresponding broadening , which includes both the instrumental and the real velocity dispersion .",
    "after this we convolved the pre - broadened stellar spectrum with a gaussian of width @xmath32 calculated to match that observed in the galaxy .",
    "the velocity dispersion of this gaussian was ( in pixels ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the observed velocity dispersion of the galaxy , @xmath35 is the measured instrumental profile ( obtained by the cross - correlation of the star with itself ) and @xmath36 is the conversion factor in @xmath37 ( see section  2.2 ) . for each index , _",
    "i _ , an empirical correction factor , @xmath38 , defined as @xmath39 , was determined for all these stars .",
    "we performed this step by calculating all the indices in ew and never in @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting @xmath38 was found by taking the mean of the measured correction factors ( see table  1 ) . from a quick look at these factors we see that",
    ", in general , the higher the resolution and weaker the feature the higher the correction . for example , the weakest line in the blue spectra , the ca4227 , shows the highest correction ( see also fig .",
    "13 ) , while in the red spectra this is the case for some of the iron features .",
    "finally , the calculated velocity dispersions amounted to @xmath41 for ngc 3379 , @xmath42 for ngc 4472 and @xmath43 for the sombrero .",
    "these values are not very different from those obtained by davies _ et al . _",
    "( 1983 ) who obtained @xmath44 for ngc  3379 and @xmath45 for ngc  4472 if we take into account that our error is about @xmath46 .",
    "for the sombrero galaxy kormendy ( 1988 ) obtained @xmath41 .",
    "we attribute the differences to the moderate seeing we had during the observations .",
    "the line - strength measurements for the three galaxies are shown in figs .",
    "1 to 6 . in the three galaxies we see appreciable gradients for most of the indices",
    ". however we detect only weak gradients for h@xmath28 , the g - band and the weakest lines : ca4227 , fe5709 and fe5782 .",
    "the low slopes in h@xmath28 were found useful for constraining the galaxy formation scenarios by fisher _",
    "( 1995 ) . in the next sections we will concentrate on the study on the nuclear regions of these galaxies as well as on their gradients . to study the inner regions we have selected values for the indices corresponding to 5   from the center , and to study radial gradients we also selected values at 15 .",
    "we did not go further inwards because our seeing was poor ( @xmath03 ) , to avoid possible nuclear emission lines ( e.g. goudfrooij & emsellem 1996 , boroson & thompson 1991 ) , and because not much surface photometry is available in the inner regions .    in fig .",
    "7 we give a comparison with the data from the current literature for ngc  4472 .",
    "our mg@xmath15 index is slightly lower than the values of the other authors but we are in a better agreement with the data of saglia _ et al . _",
    "for h@xmath28 the agreement is generally good while our values fall in the middle range of other observations . for the sake of brevity ,",
    "we have not shown other comparisons but , for example , for ngc  3379 our mg@xmath15 and h@xmath28 indices obtained are in a very good agreement with davies _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) , while their is higher than ours .",
    "the main sources of errors are : the poisson noise , the error in the adopted zero - point of the calculated rotation curve ( used to de - redshift the spectra ) , the chosen velocity dispersion correction factors and the transformation to the extended lick - system .    a quantitative estimate of the photon counting statistics has been carried out following the error analysis of spectroscopic features by rich ( 1988 ) .",

    "the @xmath52 translates to a magnitude error @xmath53 :    @xmath54 ^{1/2}\\ ] ]    the uncertainty caused by the adopted zero - point of the rotation curve was estimated by calculating the rotation curves separately for each star and then comparing the differences in the obtained line - strengths .",
    "the errors due to the correction for velocity dispersion and the conversion to the lick - system were estimated in the same way , by looking at the dispersion in the line - strengths obtained from different stars .",
    "typical errors of the various types are tabulated in table  2 . here",
    "one can notice that in general the conversion to the expanded lick - system introduces the most important uncertainty .",

    "looking at the respective diagrams in these figures we see that a difference between models using the two imf s is seen only in the redder spectral indices such as tio@xmath25 or the redder colors such as @xmath59 .",
    "of course , the unimodal imf gives us higher line - strengths since the number of low - mass stars is higher and therefore the relative number of _ diluting _ blue stars is lower .",
    "looking at all these figures , but excluding those diagrams that contain iron features , we infer that to fit this set of galaxies we need either solar metallicity and very high ages ( say 15  gyr or even more ) or metallicities that are higher than solar and lower ages ( around say 8  gyr ) but never very low ages .",
    "we also see that the colors seem to be best fitted using metallicities lower than those used for line - strengths as one can see when comparing the best fits of the color - color diagrams with those of the index - index diagrams . this shows how important is the combination of colors and indices in this kind of studies ( see also sections  3.1.4 and 3.1.6 ) . from the index vs. h@xmath24 diagram",
    "one can conclude that the observed gradients inside each galaxy must be attributed to the metallicity rather than age variations . from the index - index diagrams we see that while most of the observed indices can be easlily fitted when plotted versus mg@xmath15 or h@xmath24 , this is not the case when plotted versus the index . in the following",
    "we will discuss various aspects of the fits .      in fig .",
    "9 we see that all the iron lines from the model are stronger than those observed , and in fig .",
    "10 we see that the models are always able to fit the different index - index plots , except those against .",
    "this suggest that iron is anomalous and deficient compared to the other indices and colors .",
    "this shows that solar ratios are not adequate to fit this kind of galaxies , confirming the results of peletier ( 1989 ) , worthey _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) , gonzalez ( 1993 ) and davies _ et al . _",
    "these results do not depend on whether we are working with a unique ssp or with a mixture of ssp s of different ages and/or metallicities ( as in section  3.2 ) as can be easily inferred from the different fe vs. mg@xmath15 plots . to try to explain these results we applied some simple models based on the hypothesis of @xmath3-enhancement .",
    "in reality , this phenomenon in principle affects all the parameters of stellar evolution and therefore a new set of isochrones ought to be obtained calculating observables for integrated stellar populations . as a first approximation",
    "we follow the conclusions of weiss _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) that for the calculation of @xmath3-enhanced indices one can use the isochrones calculated for solar abundance ratios , keeping the global metallicity constant but changing the ratios . in fig .",
    "11 we find better solutions for the mg and fe indices , but worse for na ( at least with the adopted ratios ) . for an imf slope of 1.35 it does not make any difference whether a unimodal or bimodal imf is chosen . from the fe vs. mg@xmath15 plots we see that to fit the data we need [ mg / fe ] in the range 0.3 to 0.7 , in agreement with the results obtained by weiss _",
    "this number does not seem to vary inside each galaxy . to conclude , we find that the metallicity ( in terms of z ) determined from the fe lines is different from that determined from the mg lines .",
    "we left the discussion of the ca4227 line for a separate section , since this is the worst fitting line . in fig .",
    "12 we plot different representative features and the color @xmath59 versus this feature .",
    "apart from our models we also plot those of worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "we see here that the discrepancy between predictions and observations is more dramatic than was found for the iron lines . independently of the imf slope , age or metallicity ,",
    "the ca4227 line in the three galaxies is much lower than predicted by the models .",
    "it has been suggested before by oconnell ( 1976 ) and worthey ( 1994 ) that calcium tracks iron .",
    "in fact in this figure we see that the fits obtained when plotting this line vs. are not as bad as when plotting it vs. the other features . even so this line can not be fitted in an acceptable way .",
    "neither is the result due to a deficiency in the supporting library of stars , since for all the other indices ( except those dominated by fe ) reasonable fits can be achieved .",
    "it looks as if ca is depleted in this type of galaxies .",
    "if however we look at other ca lines we can not easily confirm this .",
    "we could not observe the ca4455 feature ( a blend containing an important contribution of ca@xmath1 ) as a result of the wavelength position of the dichroic used for the observations , and the ca ii near - ir triplet seems to give only a small depletion .",
    "( 1990 ) for ngc 4472 found a total ew of @xmath63 for the two strongest lines , corrected for velocity dispersion . if we model this feature , using the stellar library of daz _ et al . _",
    "( 1989 ) and preserving their definitions ( for details see paper i ) , we see that our best fitting models predict an ew of around @xmath64 ( see tables  7 and 8) .",
    "this means that we find some depletion , but much less than for the ca4227 feature .    as can be seen in the ca4227 vs. mg@xmath15 diagram of fig .",
    "11 it is easy to understand that an @xmath3-enhanced scenario does not fit the observed ca4227 since this feature is almost all due to calcium , another @xmath3-element .",
    "the same plot also shows us that , even considering this scenario , the small contribution to this feature by fe@xmath1 ( around @xmath65 by inspection in the arcturus atlas ) can not explain the observed data .",
    "since the @xmath66 isotope is much less abundant than the @xmath67 we also can not attribute this effect to the fact that @xmath66 isotope is not produced in quantities appropriate to its solar abundance and because it is made in type ia supernovae ( those that ignite a carbon deflagration very near the chandrasekhar mass ) as recently suggested by woosley & weaver ( 1995 )",
    ".    rose ( 1984 ) measured ca@xmath68 h and k indices in stars , finding that hyades and pleiades dwarfs present strong ca@xmath68-emision compared with field dwarfs .",
    "he suggested that many of the principal absorption features in the blue spectral region are affected by stellar activity .",
    "however , in another paper ( rose 1994 ) , he himself measured the ca4227 line in 47  tuc and m32 , and reached the opposite conclusion to that which we find here .",
    "this suggests that this effect , if it is real , will be present only in bright early - type galaxies in the same way as mg tends to be enhanced with respect to fe in this kind of galaxies .",
    "if this result is general it will have important consequences for our knowledge of element - synthesis in type ii supernovae .",
    "however we can not strongly affirm the anomalous behavior of ca for two principal reasons .",
    "firstly , ca4227 is a weak line and secondly because , as one can see from table  1 , its conversion to the extended lick - system entails one of the highest corrections ( -0.35 ) .",
    "the error in this correction is quite large , as a result of which this depletion formally only is a @xmath69 result . to see whether the depletion is really present , we show the spectrum of ngc  4472 together with the star hr  3461 , for which wfgb measure an ew for the ca4227 of @xmath70 and we measure @xmath71 , while for the galaxy we find a value @xmath72 ( the last two ew converted to the lick - system ) . for the present",
    "we can say only that this will need more study and that observations of the ca@xmath68 triplet feature in the near - ir may give additional help .",
    "since the number of observables is large , we have implemented a _ merit - function _ , _ m _ , defined as    @xmath73    where @xmath74 , @xmath75 are the synthetic and observed variable @xmath76 respectively and @xmath77 is the corresponding observational error .",
    "all these quantities must be expressed in magnitudes to perform the calculation of the _ m_. finally , @xmath78 is the assigned weight .    in practice",
    "we determine a separate merit figure for the set of colors @xmath79 and for the set of line - strengths @xmath80 .",
    "the merit function determines the goodness of a fit for all observables taken together .",
    "the problem of optimizing a fit is now reduced to finding a minimum for this merit function .",
    "since the observational errors are non - zero the code calculates the maximum acceptable value for the merit , _",
    "m@xmath81 _ using the same equation , but using the observational error instead of @xmath82 .",
    "any solution that gives a value of merit smaller than _ m@xmath81 _ is in principle acceptable .",
    "in this paper we have assigned the same total weight to the colors and to the lines .",
    "therefore the final global merit is calculated as follows    @xmath83      to find the best solutions we first have to give weights to each color and index . as has been shown before it is clear that whatever the metallicities , ages or imf slopes",
    "are we can not fit the iron lines , possibly because of fe deficiency . for that reason in this paper we give a weight of 0 to indices composed mainly by iron .",
    "we also assign a weight of 0 to the ca4227 aborption line due to its apparently strong _",
    "depletion_. to the other observables we give a weight of 1 except for the cn1 and cn2 , because they are the same index ( they only differ in the definition of the blue pseudocontinuum bandpass ) and therefore we assing a weight of 0.7 to each instead of 1 , so that their global weight is higher than 1 but lower than 2 .",
    "the given weights are summarized in table  5 ( case a ) . on the basis of the observational errors given in table  2 ( excluding the error from the conversion to the expanded lick - system ) and on the assigned weights ,",
    "only merits smaller than 10.0 can be considered as acceptable fits . however , as one can see later , the obtained merits are often as high as 20 .",
    "these numbers are probably still acceptable , since we did not include the systematic uncertainties in converting our indices to the expanded lick system and systematic errors in the theoretical models .",
    "using this merit function we scanned the 3-parameter space ( z , age,@xmath60 ) for each galaxy .",
    "since our ssp models make use of the isochrones with a large step in metallicities ( see paper i ) we made a new grid of synthetic values by interpolating linearly between the output obtained for z=0.008 , z=0.02 and z=0.05 to obtain the synthetic observables corresponding to z=0.012 , z=0.016 , z=0.03 and z=0.04 .",
    "14 shows the merit values obtained for ngc  3379 at the two selected positions 5   and 15 . to obtain this figure we used a unimodal imf with slopes varying from 0 to 2.3 , while the age was varied from 1 to 17  gyr .",
    "we plot the contours and the grey - levels for merits which are lower than @xmath84 .",
    "we choose this maximum acceptable limit to be safe and to avoid excluding even moderately possible solutions . in fig .",
    "15 we scanned the same parameter space to fit this galaxy but using a bimodal imf . comparing the two figures it is clear that the unimodal imf gives worse fits and for that reason we will work throughout this paper with a bimodal imf .",
    "the same results were found in paper i using our full chemo - evolutionary population synthesis model .",
    "the main difference that we found looking at the fits obtained with the two imf s , is the fact that the best fits obtained using a unimodal imf require lower slopes than those obtained with the bimodal imf .",
    "we expect this since the unimodal imf yields a higher number of low - mass stars ( see paper i ) .",
    "as a general conclusion we can say that these galaxies can not be fitted assuming low values for the age .",
    "the inner regions of the three galaxies must be metal - rich since merit figures lower than 25.0 are only found for metallicities higher than solar .",
    "in particular ngc  4472 is even more metal - rich than the other two galaxies .",
    "looking at figs .",
    "14 and 15 we see that to fit the two selected positions of ngc  3379 we must keep the age almost constant with values around 13  gyr , while the metallicity varies from values higher than solar ( z@xmath00.03 ) at 5   to lower than solar ( z@xmath00.016 ) at 15 .",
    "we also notice that it is not possible to obtain acceptable fits if we maintain the metallicity constant but change the age and/or the imf slope .",
    "however this is not the case for ngc  4472 ( see fig .",
    "16 ) for which we find acceptable solutions if we decrease the age from 10  gyr to 8  gyr going outward and maintain the metallicity constant at @xmath0z=0.04 .",
    "of course we also find a fit if we keep the age constant around 10  gyr but decrease the metallicity from z=0.04 to z=0.03 going outward . for the bulge of the sombrero galaxy ( see fig .",
    "17 ) a decrease in the metallicity is required when going outward and no age - variable metallicity - constant solution will do .",
    "we see that this galaxy seems to behave in the same way as ngc  3379 but with ages slightly lower .",
    "we can conclude that the observed radial index gradients are attributable to metallicity gradients rather than gradients in age .",
    "the fact that this conclusion can not be completely verified in ngc  4472 may be explained if we take into account that this galaxy is much larger than the other two , and thus the measured positions represent relatively small fractions of its effective radius ( see table  4 ) .",

    "we scanned again the whole parameter space ( z,@xmath60,age ) and examined the fits using the merit function .",
    "we found that the inclusion of dust does not improve the fits , except for the sombrero galaxy at 15   where we obtained a better fit including @xmath87 .      from the previous color - index and index - index diagrams",
    "we have inferred that the iron lines are not well fitted by the models .",
    "however to be more complete one might think to include them in the fitting procedure and neglect the magnesium features or take other weighting distributions to check the validity of our selection and for a better interpretation of our fits . for that purpose , together with the choice of weights used throughout this work ( case a ) in which we have not given any weight to the fe and ca lines , we defined four alternative merit functions . in case",
    "b we have taken into account all the iron features and assigned each a weight of 0.43 , so that their global weight is 3 , the same as the sum of the magnesium features . in case c instead of neglecting the iron lines as in case",

    "the same result was found in casuso _",
    "( 1996 ) on the basis of the mg@xmath15 index . to solve the problem",
    ", we proposed a scenario invoking an imf skewed towards high - mass stars during a short initial period @xmath89 ( smaller than 1  gyr ) , followed by preferential low - mass star formation during the remaining time . in that paper the favored level of metallicity reached after this short period was around @xmath90 for fitting the inner regions of the three galaxies .",
    "we will use here only the bimodal imf , since we showed in section  3.1.4 that this works slightly better than the unimodal imf for a unique ssp model .",
    "this was also shown in paper i for the evolutionary model for a limited set of indices .",
    "once again we work with our merit function to account for the whole set of colors and line - strengths contained in the observed data .",
    "the parameter space to be scanned is therefore bounded by the values proposed in table  8 of paper i for the pairs ( @xmath91,@xmath92 ) which drive the gas to higher than solar metallicity at @xmath89 .",
    "however since in the present paper we not only want to fit the three galaxies at 5 , but also at 15 , it is also required to use the pairs of parameters which drive the metallicity to solar after the initial period , as in fact was shown in section  3.1.6 using the ssp models .",
    "we scanned this initial period of time with values of 0.2 , 0.5 and 1  gyr .",
    "finally we choose to scan the remaining imf slope @xmath60 between 1.3 and 2.3 , while the age of the galaxy is varied between 1 to 17  gyr .",
    "to illustrate our best fits , in figs .  18 to 20 , we have presented those merit figures using the weights of case a ( see section  3.1.6 ) which are lower than @xmath93 ( 25.0 ) for @xmath89 equal to @xmath94 . for the sake of brevity we did not plot here the cases for @xmath89 equal to @xmath95 and @xmath96 because , even if they show better fits than those in figs .",
    "14 to 17 , they are in general slightly worse than those obtained with @xmath94 . for this reason we concentrate on this latter value for the initial period .",
    "we point out that both the final metallicity as well as the average metallicity are now non free input parameters as in ssp models , because they depend on the selected @xmath89 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath60 and the age of the galaxy which determine the followed chemical evolution .",
    "we also point out that in these plots we selected the pairs ( @xmath91,@xmath92 ) to drive the metallicity to @xmath97 at @xmath89 except for the last two rows of merit diagrams of each figure in which the metallicity raises only to values around solar at @xmath89 .",
    "however , different chemical evolutions could be achieved by varying @xmath60 and the age of the galaxy , driving the metallicity to values different from those obtained at @xmath89 .",
    "for example , if we make the imf slope low and the age high the metallicity continues raising ( see for details paper i ) .    a general trend which can be found looking at figs .",
    "18 to 20 is that acceptable fits for the three galaxies are in fact possible .",
    "also one can notice that the grey levels are now darker than in figs .",
    "14 to 17 , indicating lower merits and hence better fits than the ones obtained with ssp models .",
    "we see that the prediction of high ages for this set of galaxies is now robust .",
    "in fact , ages above @xmath98 are preferred to match the data .",
    "we also see that to fit the three galaxies we require values of @xmath60 in the second phase always greater than @xmath99 , indicating that after the first rapid formation the formed stars were primarily of lower mass than in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "solutions involving @xmath101 for the second period are not acceptable , because then we can not stabilize the chemical evolution which continues raising the metallicity to higher values ( even higher than z=0.1 ) .",
    "all this shows that low - mass stars are very important in this kind of systems as was pointed out by e.g. faber & french ( 1980 ) .",
    "another general conclusion is that we require the sfr coefficient ( @xmath91 ) to be in the range @xmath102 ( with low @xmath89 ) meaning that our values are high compared to the solar neighborhood , estimated to be @xmath103 ( arimoto & yoshii 1986 ) , but much lower than the values proposed by these authors in their second paper ( 1987 ) to fit the ellipticals ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is that they stop the star formation after the occurrence of the galactic winds i.e. after 1  gyr of their model . in our study",
    "such high values do not emerge because we do not stop the star formation ( unless all the gas has been consumed , precisely when using such high values of @xmath91 with normal or even higher imf slope ) and therefore unacceptable values for the metallicity for the remaining gas are obtained .",
    "this happens especially when working at low imf slopes .",
    "this difference in input physics has important consequences to the fits obtained , since models which stop the star formation after a short initial period of time only allow the formation of stars with a mixture of metallicities but never with a mixture of ages .",
    "we also differ from arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) in the prediction of the slope of the imf where they assume to be @xmath105 ( slightly lower than salpeter ) . to compare our results with theirs we have to look at the results obtained with the unimodal imf .",
    "the prediction obtained by ourselves in paper i ( as can be deduced from fig .",
    "20 of that paper ) is around @xmath106 , therefore higher than salpeter and than their estimate .",
    "we attribute this difference to the fact that they need this combination of lower than salpeter imf and very high star formation rates to yield the required high metallicities in their period previous to the occurrence of the galactic wind ( 1  gyr ) , while we obtain this in a shorter time by means of lower imf slopes than they require .",
    "bressan et al .",
    "( 1994 ) also follow the galactic - wind scheme , without changing the salpeter imf , but requiring a shorter period of time before the appearence of the galactic winds .",
    "these short periods of initial different behaviour are in better agreement with our best fits .    now turning our attention to the differences within galaxies and between them , we see that ngc  3379 and the bulge of sombrero galaxy appear to lie in the same regions of ( @xmath60,age ) parameter space for a given ( @xmath91,@xmath92 ) .",
    "we also see that , for the same set of parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 , ngc  4472 at 5   gives better fits for ages which are greater by @xmath107 than the ones obtained for the other two galaxies at the same distances from their centers . however , by looking at the results obtained with the ssp models and the metallicities obtained in the best fits ( given in table  7 ) we are biased to think that after the initial period , @xmath89 , ngc  3379 and ngc  4594 reached lower metallicities than ngc  4472 , as also was shown in paper i. this also holds when varying the value of the imf slope for the remaining time .",
    "the full chemo - evolutionary models also produce the same conclusion as the ssp models when fitting the observed gradients , i.e. the metallicities of the outer regions are lower for ngc  3379 and ngc  4594 but not noticeably lower for ngc  4472 , probably because the latter is too large and therefore the radial separation of the observed points does not represent an important fraction of its effective radius .",
    "in fact in figs .  18 and 20",
    "we see that the outer regions of ngc  3379 and ngc  4594 are only fitted in an acceptable way for the last two rows of merit figures , where the metallicity does not raise above solar at @xmath89 . for more details about the final and average metallicities",
    "see table  8 , where we summarize the most representative fits .",
    "we also point out that in this table comparing the b - v and v - k colors of ngc  3379 and sombrero galaxy we are inclined to think that the latter could be affected by a small amount of dust , since its colors are too red while the lines seem to be well fitted .",
    "we think it is likely that a reddening correction of e(b - v)@xmath00.05 should be applied .",
    "however , the improvement in our fit will not be very large , given the size of the error - bars .    finally , in figs .",
    "21 and 22 we show the chemical and fractional gas mass evolution as well as the distribution of the _ live _ stars as a funcion of metallicity , age and temperature for the two selected positions of ngc  3379 .",
    "we see that at 5   the stars mainly have metallicities larger than solar ( weighting in the v band ) but with approximately @xmath108 of the light coming from stars with metallicity of solar or lower .",
    "however at 15   we see that most of the stars ( around @xmath109 ) have solar metallicity . from the diagrams giving the predicted distributions of stars as functions of time",
    "one can also notice that the bulk of the stars were formed at an early - stage of the evolution of the galaxy , at ages lower than some @xmath110 .",
    "in general , for the three galaxies we obtain that the contribution to the light in the u band is around @xmath111 for giants and @xmath112 for dwarfs , in the v band it is @xmath113 for giants and @xmath113 for dwarfs , while in the k band the proportions are @xmath114 for giants and @xmath115 for dwarfs respectively .      we find that using the evolutionary model most of the stars were formed in the early stages ( @xmath116 ) of the galactic evolution , as seen in figs .",
    "21 and 22 .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that qualitatively the fits from the evolutionary model are not very different from those of the single - age , single - metallicity models .",
    "somewhat better fits are obtained however , indicating that these galaxies probably have stars with a mixture of metallicities , as has been found also in our galactic bulge ( rich 1988 ) .",
    "it is also easy to understand that the evolutionary model gives somewhat larger ages , since the stars of lower - metallicities have to be compensated by giving the whole population a greater age .",
    "we have obtained high quality observations of almost the whole set of line - indices of the extended lick - system for three representative early - type galaxies , and have applied a new spectrophotometric chemo - evolutionary population synthesis model developed by ourselves in a previous paper ( paper i ) .",
    "we can make models which give good fits in all the colors and many of the most important line - indices .",
    "these fits however can not synthesize quantitatively a number of lines primarily from fe and ca .",
    "we find that 6 independent fe lines are too weak compared to lines of all other elements indicating that the iron - abundance is anomalous and deficient in the radial range of the galaxies that we studied .",
    "this implies that the global metallicity inferred must depend on whether we use magnesium or iron lines as the prime indicators . invoking @xmath3-enhancement",
    "one can obtain better fits for the iron lines , but other features such as nad then become worse if we follow the abundance ratios given in weiss _",
    "et al _ ( 1995 ) .",
    "finally we find that the ca4227 is much fainter than predicted by the models .",
    "in general we find that the three galaxies require metallicities higher than solar for the inner regions while the ages are older than 10  gyr , and the observed radial gradients are due to metallicity decreasing outward .",
    "we also find that ngc  4472 is more metal - rich , than the other two galaxies .    to fit this set of galaxies with the full chemical evolutionary population synthesis model we used the variable imf scenario ( defined in paper i ) which invokes an imf skewed towards high - mass stars in the begining , during a short period of time ( smaller than 1  gyr .",
    ") , and towards low - mass stars later for the remaining time .",
    "the best fits indicate that dwarfs contribute @xmath117 to the u band , @xmath118 in v band and @xmath119 in k band .",
    "we find that slightly better fits are being obtained with the chemical evolutionary model than with the single - age , single - metallicity model , justifying the extra complications .",
    "however , since the predicted spread in metallicities is not very large , and since the bulk of the stars were formed at the very early stages of the galactic evolution ( at age lower than @xmath120 ) we conclude that the single - age single - metallicity stellar population models offer reasonable first order fits to this kind of stellar systems , especially if one wishes to avoid comprobational complexity .",
    "this study shows that it would be useful to extend the present analysis to include other features at shorter wavelengths in the uv region such as the indices of rose ( 1994 ) , and to the near - ir with indices such as na@xmath1 at @xmath121 , the ca@xmath68 triplet and the co or h@xmath15o features . to understand the stellar populations of the early - type galaxies and to e.g. disentangle age and metallicity ( jones & worthey 1995 ) , bressan _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) it will be important to introduce as many constraints as possible , by observing the galaxies in many calibrated absorption lines .",
    "we are indebted to the referee , j. gonzalez , who have done a very thorough work on our first version as a result of which the present paper have been greatly improved .",
    "we are grateful to j. gorgas for providing us with a set of observational results before publication .",
    "we also thanks a. weiss for his comments .",
