    "the effect of quenched disorder on condensed matter systems is an important and challenging problem that continues to be actively investigated , because of its relevance to real systems , which always contain some amount of random inhomogeneity .",
    "recently , much attention has focused on the random field xy model as a minimal model of a broad class of systems such as disordered josephson junction arrays@xcite , roughening of crystal surfaces growing on a disordered substrate@xcite , the pinning of wigner crystals , vortex lattices in superconductors@xcite or charge density waves@xcite .",
    "another system that is considerably less well understood is the superfluid transition , e.g. , he@xmath0 in the random , `` fractal  like '' environment of aerogel@xcite . in apparent contradiction to the harris criterion@xcite , the disorder modifies the critical properties of the transition ( including the critical exponents ) .",
    "the central question addressed in all of the above studies is : does a distinct low temperature `` glass '' phase exist in any of these disordered systems ? and if so , what ( if any ) _",
    "static _ property distinguishes it from the high temperature , conventional thermally disordered phase ?",
    "the answer to the second question is clearly subtle : arguments dating back to larkin@xcite show that it is impossible to have long - ranged translational order in three dimensions in a randomly pinned elastic medium .",
    "hence , the glass can not be distinguished from the high temperature `` liquid '' phase by long - ranged translational order .    in the context of pinned vortex lattices in dirty type ii superconductors , m. p. a. fishers@xcite original argument for the existence",
    "a vortex glass phase is based on a two ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model in which the random pinning is relevant at low temperatures but becomes irrelevant at higher temperatures.@xcite the low temperature , pinning relevant phase is then identified as the glass phase , and the temperature at which the pinning becomes irrelevant is the thermodynamically sharp glass transition temperature .    unfortunately , this simple scenario can not be directly carried over to three dimensions for vortex lattices ( though , as we shall show later , it almost can for smectics in aerogel ) . in three - dimensional vortex lattices ( and other pinned",
    "isotropic elastic media listed in the opening paragraph ) , the aforementioned larkin argument shows that disorder is _ always _ relevant in @xmath1 .",
    "hence , its relevance can not be used as a criterion for distinguishing the glass and liquid phases .",
    "so what can ?",
    "one appealing proposal is the `` bragg glass''@xcite picture , in which the glass , while being elastically disordered is topologically ordered , and is therefore distinguished from the liquid by being free of unbound dislocation loops , which proliferate in the liquid .",
    "the glass transition is then identified as an `` unbinding '' of the dislocation loops .",
    "this transition is then , qualitatively , very similar to the melting of the flux lattice in the absence of disorder , which can also be thought of as an unbinding of dislocation loops .",
    "the only difference is that in the glass problem , the flux lattice is translationally disordered _ both _ above and _ below _ the transition .",
    "the absence of defects below the transition , however , means that the low temperature solid phase still has a finite shear modulus , leading to glassy behavior .",
    "another related system that has been experimentally investigated is nematic liquid crystals in aerogel near and below the pure system s nematic ",
    "smectic - a ( na ) transition temperature.@xcite the mean - field theory of a bulk , pure smectic liquid crystal looks like that of an xy model , with a complex scalar order parameter @xmath2 characterizing the smectic density wave .",
    "as was first noted by de gennes@xcite a more precise model must include the coupling of @xmath2 to the nematic director fluctuations @xmath3 , which takes the model out of the xy universality class.@xcite although the agreement between experiments and theory is far from perfect , the _ theoretical _ consensus is that the scaling near the na transition _ should _ cross over from that of a three dimensional xy transition line , ( as in a neutral superfluid ) to inverted xy - like behavior with anisotropic x - ray correlation length exponents.@xcite    the goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of disorder on the liquid crystal phase diagram in the vicinity of and below the na transition .",
    "does the na transition survive in the presence of even weak disorder ?",
    "if so , what is the nature of the low - temperature phase ?",
    "a condensed report of some of our results , the details and extensions of which are presented in this paper , has appeared in recent publications.@xcite .",
    "our interest in this problem was stimulated by recent experiments@xcite that aim to answer these very questions . in these experiments , a liquid crystal that exhibits a bulk nematic ",
    "smectic - a transition is introduced into an aerogel .",
    "x - ray scattering measurements show that this system _ never _ develops true smectic long - ranged ( or even quasi - long - ranged ) order : the translational correlation length @xmath4 remains finite at all temperatures .",
    "this length smoothly increases as temperature is lowered across the bulk na transition temperature , monotonically and slowly rising to some finite asymptotic low temperature limit , which does _ not _ appear to be associated with any natural length scale of the aerogel itself .",
    "our theory predicts this x - ray correlation length as the scale at which the pinning disorder energy begins to dominate over the smectic elastic energy , consistent with these experimental observations ; the smectic correlation length is _ not _",
    "simply `` pore '' size of the aerogel.@xcite this behavior is also in sharp contrast to the fast rise of the smectic correlation length to the nominal pore size at the bulk transition temperature that one would expect in more regularly porous materials , which can be understood as a bulk - like sharp transition cut - off by the finite pore size . the specific heat in aerogel was also measured and was found to exhibit a broadened but very well defined peak , near but slightly shifted down from the bulk transition temperature , t@xmath5 .",
    "these experimental observations suggest the destruction of the na transition by the disorder imposed by the fractal aerogel environment.@xcite however , in contrast , recent experiments@xcite , which study the na transition in even lower density aerosils , appear to show a true resolution limited heat capacity singularity , while displaying a _",
    "finite _ x - ray smectic correlation length indicative of short - range translational order .",
    "these latter experimental findings appear to support the idea that the nematic ",
    "smectic - a transition in pure systems , when confined in a low density quenched random structure , is replaced by a new phase transition into a novel thermodynamically stable phase with a finite smectic correlation length in both the high and low temperature phases .",
    "the main conclusion of our work is that , consistent with these and many other experiments,@xcite the three dimensional smectic phase , as defined by the existence of quasi - long - ranged translational order , is unstable to arbitrarily weak _ quenched _ disorder ( i.e. , arbitrarily low aerogel or aerosil density ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that a new _ orientationally _ ordered low temperature `` smectic bragg glass '' ( sbg ) phase replaces the smectic phase , and a thermodynamically sharp nematic - to - sbg ( n - sbg ) transition , can survive in the presence of arbitrarily weak disorder , if and only if two _",
    "universal _ positive definite anomalous exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfy the bounds    @xmath8    [ bounds12 ]    where the bounds in eqs.[bound_orientations],b come from the requirement of long - ranged orientational order and the condition for dislocations to remain confined , respectively .",
    "the region in the @xmath9 plane that satisfies these three bounds is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "( 150,60)(0,0 ) ( -20,-57 )    ( 150,0)(0,0 )    fig.1 .",
    "the region indicates those values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 for which , in three dimensions , the long - range orientationally ordered `` smectic bragg glass '' phase is stable for sufficiently small disorder ( sufficiently low density aerogel ) .",
    "[ bounds ]    these exponents are _ universal _ ; i.e. , the same for _ all _ smectics in low density _ quenched _ disordered media .",
    "unfortunately , we have only been able to calculate them in a rather poor approximation : a @xmath10 expansion .",
    "since we are interested in @xmath11 , the ostensibly small parameter @xmath12 in this expansion is @xmath13 , and so the expansion is expected to be rather poor .",
    "however , taking this expansion as our best estimate ( since it is our _ only _ estimate ) of the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we obtain , in @xmath11 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these values , which are illustrated by the dot labeled `` @xmath12-expansion '' in fig.1 , violate the bounds in eq.[bounds12 ] , and , hence , imply that the smectic bragg glass phase does _ not _ exist , and that the thermodynamically sharp na transition is destroyed by the presence of any disorder , no matter how weak .",
    "however , since the expansion parameter in this calculation @xmath16 in the physical case of @xmath1 , this argument that the transition and the sbg are destroyed is utterly uncompelling .",
    "fortunately , experiments ( which we will describe shortly ) well _ below _ the pure transition temperature @xmath17 can measure the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 . with these numbers in hand ,",
    "the bounds given in eqs.[bounds12 ] would then provide an unambiguous prediction as to whether or not the transition to the sbg is _ always _ destroyed by disorder .",
    "the physical significance of these exponents is quite intriguing : they reflect `` anomalous elasticity '' , which , in this context , refers to the fact that the smectic bend modulus @xmath18 and the layer compression modulus @xmath19 are _ not _ constants in the randomly pinned smectic , but , rather , singular functions of the wavevector @xmath20 under consideration . @xmath21 and @xmath22 diverge and vanish respectively , as @xmath23 , according to the scaling laws :    @xmath24    [ bk ]    here @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the projections of @xmath20 along and perpendicular to the mean normal to the smectic layers , respectively , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 without arguments @xmath20 will here and hereafter denote the `` bare '' values of the smectic elastic moduli , i.e. , their values in the pure ( bulk ) smectic .",
    "the universal exponent @xmath27 is determined by @xmath6 and @xmath7 through eq.[zeta1 ] .",
    "the `` non - linear '' length scales @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the distances in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 directions respectively , beyond which the disorder - driven anomalous elasticity is manifest .",
    "that is , eqs.[bk ] only hold for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if either of these limits is violated , both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath20 independent ( up to logarithms ) , as in pure smectics.@xcite in three dimensions these nonlinear length scales are given by    @xmath34    [ xi_zp_nl ]    expressions for these lengths for general dimensionality @xmath35 are given in eqs.[xinlperp ] and [ z - perp_relation ] of sec.[anom_elasticity ] . in the above @xmath36",
    "is a measure of the strength of one of two types of disorder , ( the other random `` field '' disorder @xmath37 being less important in three dimensions ) whose relation to various parameters of the aerogel is given in sec.[model ] . for",
    "now , it suffices to say that @xmath36 is a monotonically increasing function of the aerogel density , and we expect it to be a smooth , analytic , non - singular , finite and non - vanishing function of temperature through the bulk na transition temperature @xmath17 . since @xmath18 is likewise well - behaved through @xmath17 , @xmath29 is as well , a fact that we will make use of shortly .",
    "although we have been unable to calculate the scaling functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 exactly , we do know that they have the simple property of making @xmath21 and @xmath22 independent of @xmath25 when the scaling argument @xmath40 is @xmath41 , and independent of @xmath42 in the opposite limit .",
    "this implies    @xmath43    this strong wavevector dependence of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( driven by disorder ) is caused by the same mechanism that leads to the much weaker ( logarithmic ) but still singular divergence and vanishing of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( driven by thermal fluctuations ) that occurs in disorder - free smectics@xcite : the anharmonic elasticity of large fluctuations in the smectic layers .    as we will demonstrate in sec.[anom_elasticity",
    "] , the effects are larger in the pinned smectic because the disorder induces layer roughness that is much larger than that due to thermal fluctuations , thereby leading to the stronger diverging and vanishing of @xmath18 and @xmath19 found here .",
    "the stability of the smectic bragg glass phase depends on @xmath7 and @xmath6 because the elastic moduli @xmath18 and @xmath19 determine _ both _ the size of the orientational fluctuations and the stability of the phase against the unbinding of dislocations . requiring that real space",
    "orientational fluctuations remain finite leads to eq.[bound_orientations ] , while dislocations remain bound only if eq.[bound_dislocations ] is satisfied . if the bounds eq.[bounds12 ]",
    "are satisfied for a real smectic liquid crystal , confined inside a low density aerogel , then the resulting @xmath44 phase diagram will be topologically identical to that displayed in fig.2 .",
    "it is important to note that all of the results quoted here are _ equilibrium _ results .",
    "in contrast , in other pinned elastic media ( e.g. , abrikosov flux lattices in dirty superconductors and charge density waves in anisotropic metals ) , it is often difficult to observe the true equilibrium behavior due to the extremely slow dynamics of those systems , which cause them to drop out of equilibrium , as evidenced by strong hysteretic effects.@xcite    in this sense , smectics , and liquid crystals in general , appear to be far better systems for investigating the _ equilibrium _ effects of quenched disorder , since they typically do _ not _ exhibit hysteresis .",
    "this suggests that liquid crystals have intrinsically faster dynamics than , e.g. , vortex lattices in superconductors , or charge density wave systems in metals .",
    "that this should be so is hardly surprising : liquid crystals are , after all , `` liquids '' in the sense that , even in the translationally ordered phases like smectics , molecules are quite free to move around . in contrast , the atoms in the conventional crystalline solids are essentially locked into lattice sites , from which they can only escape by thermally activated hopping over substantial energy barriers . even at room temperature ,",
    "this hopping is extremely slow ; the fact that even `` high - t@xmath45 '' superconductors are much colder than room temperature exacerbates the problem further .",
    "so , because of both their liquid - like _ micro_structure and _ micro_dynamics , _ and _ the fact that they are at higher temperature than , e.g. , superconductors , one might have anticipated that it would be far easier to observe the equilibrium effects of quenched pinning in liquid crystals than in other pinned elastic media studied to date .",
    "this belief is supported by experiments,@xcite and so we believe that the _ equilibrium _ results we obtain here should be directly testable in experiments .",

    "a schematic ( aerogel density @xmath46  -  temperature @xmath47 ) phase diagram for a smectic liquid crystal , confined inside a low density aerogel , valid _ if and only if _ all of the bounds , eq.[bounds12 ] are satisfied .",
    "as discussed in the text the `` smectic bragg glass '' ( sbg ) and `` nematic elastic glass '' ( neg ) phases are , respectively , translationally and orientationally disordered , but are topologically ordered , and are therefore distinct from each other and from the fully disordered `` isotropic '' phase . the dotted line within the sbg phase represents a remnant of the disorder driven pinning transition of fig.6 , rounded by the anharmonic elasticity studied in secs.[anom_elasticity]-[random_field_3 - 5 ] .",
    "[ phase_diagram ]    the theoretical analysis that leads to these conclusions is quite interesting and novel .",
    "our first - principles analysis of smectics in aerogel demonstrates that the random pinning induced by the aerogel leads to only two potentially relevant types of random perturbations to the smectic : a random _ positional _ field disorder ( hereafter referred to simply as the `` random field '' and designated by @xmath37 ) , which represents the aerogel s tendency to force the smectic layers to sit at particular _ positions _ , and a random _ orientational _ field disorder ( hereafter called the `` tilt '' field , with designation @xmath36 ) , reflecting the aerogel s proclivity for particular _ orientations _ of the nematogens and smectic layers .",
    "if we ignore the anharmonic effects that lead to anomalous elasticity , we find that the response of the smectic - a phase to the random field disorder in _ three _ dimensions is in very close mathematical analogy to that of the xy - model in _ two _ dimensions.@xcite while this suggests that a nontrivial glassy phase might replace the smectic - a phase in analogy with the experience with the 2d xy - model,@xcite the presence of _ tilt _ disorder ( which is always generated by random field ) actually destroys this phase . even in the regime where the random field by itself has no effect at long scales ,",
    "the tilt disorder leads to short - range smectic order parameter @xmath2 correlations , which fall off exponentially in the direction of the layer normal and as a gaussian within the smectic layers ( within a purely _ harmonic _ elastic model ) .",
    "this absence of long - ranged order in the elastic model is a strong indication of its limitation and that dislocation defects are likely to proliferate .",
    "focusing on the most important part of randomness , the tilt disorder , we find , in the approximation of ignoring elastic anharmonicities , that disorder _ always _ creates dislocations .",
    "the formalism we use to demonstrate this is new , powerful , and potentially applicable to a wide variety of candidate `` bragg glass '' systems@xcite .",
    "once dislocations are present , the phase is best characterized as a nematic in a random tilt field .",
    "however , subsequent examination of orientational fluctuations in this nematic lead to the conclusion that tilt disorder destroys the orientational order of the smectic layers as well . whether an orientationally and translationally disordered low temperature phase distinct from the conventionally disordered high temperature isotropic phase is a `` nematic elastic glass '' ( neg ) , separated from it by a _ disclination _",
    "unbinding transition , is the subject of an active current investigation.@xcite    including anharmonic elastic effects considerably modifies this picture .",
    "although spatial dimensions @xmath48 greater than three are clearly irrelevant to experiment , it is conceptually extremely useful ( and fun ! ) to generalize our model to arbitrary spatial dimensions .",

    "these considerations , taken together with the fractal nature of the aerogel , and eq.[g_corr ] , lead to the following form for the correlation function of the random tilt - disorder @xmath254 @xmath258 which is _ short  ranged_. this defines the tilt field disorder variance @xmath36 .    thus our model of the na transition in aerogel is characterized by the effective hamiltonian functional @xmath259 , with @xmath178 , @xmath260 , and @xmath261 given by eqs.([hdg ] ) , ( [ hrhoii ] ) , and ( [ hn1 ] ) , respectively .",

    "in this section we study the disordered na model , defined in the preceding section , within the low - temperature phase . while it is tempting to directly analyze the model @xmath259 written in terms of the smectic order parameter @xmath2 , we will not do so here .",
    "our motivation for this is two - fold : ( i ) as discussed in the introduction , even for the bulk ( disorder - free ) case the results obtain through such a direct ( de gennes model ) approach , have , so far , failed to give predictions that agree with experiments even on the _ bulk _ na transition . having",
    "not fully understood the difficulties with the bulk na transition , we hesitate to use such a high temperature ( `` soft - spin '' ) analysis to study the significantly more complicated na transition in the presence of disorder ( i.e. , confined inside the aerogel ) .",
    "( ii ) while such a `` soft - spin '' approach is often superior in understanding the critical properties of the _ transition _ and the high temperature phase , it is significantly less successful in the analysis of the low temperature phase . for example",
    "it is _ known _ to _ incorrectly _ predict the lower critical dimension in , e.g. , the random field ising model , as well as completely missing the existence of the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the xy - model .",
    "since one of the main goals of the current initial investigation of the disordered smectics problem is to ascertain the stability and nature of the low temperature phase , we leave the direct de gennes model approach to this problem to subsequent publications@xcite .    instead , here , as a first analysis of the problem , we choose the elastic , low - temperature approach in terms of the goldstone phonon mode @xmath265 .",
    "the predictions of such an approach for the ordered pure smectic phase are free of controversies , and are in agreement with experiments on bulk smectics .",
    "we will not , in either this or the next section ( section [ tilt - only_model ] ) , treat the full elastic model in all its complexity , but rather , begin by simplifying the model by ignoring _ elastic anharmonicities _ ( i.e. , terms higher than quadratic in gradients of @xmath265 ) . we will also , in both this and the next section , neglect the effects of dislocations , and focus on three spatial dimensions .",
    "all of these restrictions will be removed in later sections of the paper , as we build up to the full complexity of the disordered smectic system .",
    "we begin by _ assuming _ the existence of smectic order and investigate if / when this assumption is violated because of the interaction of the smectic with the random environment of the aerogel .    within the ordered smectic phase ,",
    "the fluctuations are conveniently described in terms of the fluctuations of the magnitude and phase of @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to show that the fluctuations of the _ magnitude _ of @xmath2 around the average value @xmath266 are `` massive '' , and can therefore be safely integrated out of the partition function , leading to only _ finite _ , unimportant shifts in the effective elastic moduli .",
    "in contrast , the phase of @xmath2 is a u(1 ) massless goldstone mode , corresponding to spontaneously broken translational symmetry .",
    "it is the essential low energy phonon degree of freedom of the smectic phase , describing the local displacement of the smectic layers from perfect periodic order . in accord with this discussion , deep within the smectic phase",
    ", we can represent the smectic order parameter as @xmath267 safely ignoring ( actually integrating out the `` massive '' ) fluctuations in the magnitude @xmath268 of @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to note that this can be done at any temperature _ below _ the transition , without any _ qualitative _ consequences for phenomena occuring on sufficiently long length scales , larger than a well - defined crossover length @xmath269 .",

    "it is , however possible , that rounded remnants of the nonanalyticities at @xmath323 , discussed above , will still be experimentally observable .",
    "the static correlation function derived in eq.[match4 ] shows that long - ranged smectic translational order is destroyed in @xmath1 . to make quantitative comparisons with experiments",

    "these correlation lengths are the distances @xmath400 and @xmath31 at which the mean squared relative displacement correlation function @xmath466 is of order @xmath467 , where @xmath468 is a lattice constant .",
    "when there is no disorder @xmath469 , the above criterion leads to    @xmath470    [ xit ]    as discussed in the extensive literature on the subject,@xcite however , the slow ( logarithmic ) divergence of the thermal part @xmath386 of @xmath471 implies that , for @xmath472 , the x - ray scattering peaks do _ not _ , in fact , become broad for @xmath473 ; instead , they become power - law divergences , rather than the lorentzians one might otherwise expect .",
    "the more strongly divergent part @xmath387 of @xmath471 _ does _ lead to genuine broadening , for @xmath474 , where @xmath475 are defined as those length scales ( i.e. , values of @xmath400 and @xmath31 ) at which @xmath476 .",
    "having computed @xmath387 within the elastically harmonic theory , we thereby find    @xmath477    [ xidelta ]    in fact , we powder average the x - ray scattering , since , as we will show in a moment , the smectic in aerogel lacks long - ranged orientational order , as well as translational order . the broad _ ring _ of x - ray scattering that results from this averaging will have its width determined entirely by @xmath478 : @xmath479 a gratifyingly simple prediction",
    ".    although it is more difficult to measure experimentally , it is nonetheless of interest to calculate the harmonic orientational correlation lengths @xmath480 , which are defined as the values of @xmath481 beyond which the mean squared orientational fluctuations @xmath482 get to be of order @xmath146 .",
    "if we ignore dislocations and anharmonic elasticity , we can obtain these lengths by simply equating the `` pure phonon '' result eq.[orientation ] for @xmath482 to @xmath146 .",
    "this gives :    @xmath483    in the next section , we will show that , unsurprisingly , these lengths give the distance beyond which dislocations unbind , invalidating the purely elastic phonon theory studied in this section .",
    "thus , orientational order persists out to _ much _ larger distances than translational order , in the limit of weak disorder where _ all _ the correlation lengths get large .",
    "indeed , in this limit the orientational correlation lengths grow exponentially with the translational ones .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with experimental determinations of the orientational correlation length , as indirectly inferred from specific heat data and related measurements.@xcite    in sec.[anom_elasticity ] , we will show that anharmonic elastic effects , which we have ignored up to now , change the relation between the x - ray correlation length @xmath484 and the orientational correlation lengths @xmath480 from exponential to power law .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath480 both remain @xmath485 continues to hold , validating our use of elastic theory ( which was predicated on the assumption that orientational fluctuations are small ) , to calculate the x - ray correlation lengths . in any case",
    ", it would be very interesting to measure the relation between translational and orientational correlation lengths as a function of temperature .",
    "all of the above results apply subject to our two initial assumptions : ( 1 ) that dislocations were _ not _ generated by the disorder , and ( 2 ) that anharmonic terms in the _ elastic _ hamiltonian could be neglected .    in the next section , we will show that , if we continue to assume ( 2 ) , assumption ( 1 ) is wrong : in the _ harmonic _ elastic approximation , in 3d dislocations _ are _ created even by arbitrarily weak disorder .    however , the effects of these dislocations turn out , in the weak disorder limit , to be felt only on length scales longer than the smaller of the orientational length @xmath486 and dislocation unbinding length @xmath151 , both of which are _ much _ longer than the translational correlation lengths .",
    "thus , our above calculations of the correlation lengths remain valid .",
    "however , in the presence of these unbound dislocation loops , the smectic glass phase is destroyed .",
    "it may be replaced by a nematic glass phase , however , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the static properties of our system in the presence of dislocations are analytically accessible , and we analyze them in the next section .    furthermore , the behavior of the correlation functions found above is modified by elastic nonlinearities ( which lead to anomalous elasticity ) , which also have a nontrivial effect on dislocations , as we demonstrate in sec.[anom_elasticity_dislocations_correlations ] .",
    "in the previous sections , we have shown that there is no long - ranged smectic translational order in the presence of the random pinning and tilting fields . however , this by itself is _ not _ sufficient to prove that there is no phase transition in this model .",
    "indeed , we know of many examples of transitions between two phases which _ both _ lack long - ranged order .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the @xmath487 xy model@xcite is perhaps the most famous example . in that problem ,",
    "the transition is associated not with the disappearance of long - ranged order , but rather , with the unbinding of neutral pairs of topological defects ( vortices ) with increasing temperature .",
    "it is reasonable , therefore , to ask whether the same thing can happen in our model : are topological defects ( i.e. , smectic dislocation loops ) still bound even in the translationally disordered phase we have discussed ? if they were , then an equilibrium phase transition would be required to produce the expected high temperature phase , in which dislocations are unbound .    of course , the divergences that destroy long - ranged order are much stronger ( power - law ) in our model for @xmath410 than in the 2d xy model , where they are logarithmic .",
    "however , there are examples of phases much more strongly disordered than the kosterlitz - thouless phase in which topological defects nonetheless remain bound.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there has been considerable speculation recently@xcite that a `` bragg glass '' phase might exist in pinned superconducting flux - line lattices .",
    "this `` bragg glass '' would be a phase in which the random pinning destroyed the translational order of the flux lattice , but did _ not _ induce dislocations in the lattice .",
    "it seems quite reasonable , therefore , to ask whether an analogous phase occurs in smectics .",
    "this section addresses this question , and shows analytically that smectic bragg glass does not occur in @xmath1 ( within a model with _ harmonic _ elasticity )",
    ". we will show later that this result maybe invalidated by elastic anharmonic effects .",
    "the starting point of our analytic theory is the `` tilt only '' model , by which we mean eq.[huii ] with the random potential @xmath225 set to zero . as discussed earlier",
    ", this theory correctly reproduces all of the static correlation functions in _ both _ the _ pinned _ ( @xmath330 ) and the non - pinned ( @xmath329 ) regimes .",
    "however , in view of the very strong irrelevance of @xmath37 to the static correlation function in _ both _ phases in the `` phonon only '' approximation , it seems quite plausible that it is also irrelevant when dislocations are included .",

    "this is very similar to the ability of free dislocations in a solid to relieve an imposed shear .",

    ", the fact that , in an anharmonic theory , the interaction energy between dislocations _ can not _ be written as a sum of pairwise interactions ( since their fields do not simply add ) makes it impossible to even write down a general expression for the energy of an arbitrary dislocation configuration . at best , one might hope to be able to write down the energy for a few simple , high symmetry configurations ( e.g. , a single , straight dislocation line ) . such specialized results would be of no use in a full statistical theory of defect unbinding , which requires consideration of very complicated , tangled configurations of dislocations , which , for entropic reasons , dominate the free energy near the dislocation binding transition .",

    "for all of these reasons , a completely honest treatment of dislocations in the full , anharmonic model is impossible , at least for mere mortals like us . rather than despair",

    "the reduced _ dual _ temperature @xmath557 depends on @xmath67 only through the overall prefactor @xmath713 , i.e. @xmath714 and therefore , for @xmath711 , diverges with system size .",
    "as discussed in our original treatment of duality , such an infinite _ downward _ renormalization of @xmath557 in the _ dual _ model implies that dislocations are _ always _ unbound , even at zero temperature , even for arbitrarily weak disorder .",
    "thus , our criterion for determining whether or not dislocations are always unbound in @xmath11 is very simple : if @xmath715 , as given by eq.[gamma1 ] , is @xmath716 , dislocations _ are _ always unbound , and _ no _ stable bragg glass phase exists , while if @xmath717 , dislocations will be bound , and a stable bragg glass phase _ will _ exist , at least at sufficiently low temperatures and weak disorder .",

    "independent of the @xmath12-expansion , our result implies the strict _ necessary , but not sufficient _ condition for the stability of the smectic bragg glass phase @xmath725 if , on the other hand , this condition is violated , then dislocations will unbind on length scales longer than @xmath123 , where @xmath123 is the value of @xmath67 in eq.[delta_t_final ] such that the correction @xmath726 becomes of @xmath727 .",
    "this gives the value of @xmath728 quoted in the introduction , with @xmath128 given by eq.[c(t ) ] .",

    "we expect the divergence of @xmath128 to overwhelm that of @xmath135 , leading to a dislocation length that gets ever shorter as @xmath134 from below .",
    "eventually , as we approach @xmath17 from below , @xmath123 , as given by eq.[xi_perpd ] , will get smaller than @xmath28 ; at this point , we are in the strong coupling regime , and our weak - disorder results no longer apply .",
    "there is another criterion in addition to eq.[stable_disl ] , that must be satisfied for the smectic bragg glass to be stable in @xmath11 : _ long - ranged orientational _",
    "order must exist .",
    "this is clear , since we have implicitly assumed the existence of such order throughout our calculation ( e.g. , in writing @xmath730 and _ assuming _ @xmath731 ) .",

    "it is essential to assess whether the random - field disorder ( @xmath37 ) _ alone _ can drive proliferation of dislocation loops , and this is the subject of current section .    to this end",

    "alone _ does _ not _ induce a proliferation of dislocation loops in three - dimensional smectics , thereby concluding our justification for the tilt - only model of randomly pinned smectics .",
    "we first review fisher s analysis as it applies to the three - dimensional random - field xy model . recall that within a defect - free model the elastic energy is balanced against the pinning energy , both much larger than the thermal energy @xmath830 .",
    "the compromise in this competition leads to phase variations that grow logarithmically with distance and typical ground - state energies that vary as @xmath951 , where @xmath67 is system size and @xmath793 is ( minus ) of the thermal eigenvalue exponent , which , due to statistical symmetry , is given exactly by @xmath952 we wish to know whether it energetically pays for the system to insert a vortex loop .",
    "confining our discussion to @xmath1 , a vortex loop of length @xmath67 will cost the system elastic energy @xmath953 , where the multiplicative logarithm is associated with the long - range xy phase deformation around the vortex line and @xmath954 is the spin - wave stiffness .",
    "for such a randomly placed vortex loop , which relieves strains by allowing spin rotations of order @xmath350 , the system can typically gain disorder energy @xmath955 .",
    "hence , this crude argument would suggest that , because of the additional multiplicative logarithmic factor in @xmath956 , it never pays to insert arbitrarily large vortex loops into the random - field xy model .",
    "however , as argued by fisher , a judicious optimization of the vortex loop location and conformation can do better energetically , and therefore it is essential to include in the stability analysis the energy minimization over the vortex position and conformation .    to this end",
    "we start out with a circular vortex loop and , as illustrated in fig.12 , try to lower its energy by moving various segments of length @xmath957 of it first by a distance @xmath958 , then by @xmath959 , etc .",

    "this therefore argues for the stability of the topologically ordered `` bragg '' glass phase in a weakly disordered three - dimensional random - field xy model .    we now extend this analysis to smectics pinned by a random periodic potential , with the main difference from the random - field xy model being the anisotropy of the smectic state .",

    "the first and most unequivocal of these is that long - ranged , and even quasi - long - ranged , smectic translational order is destroyed by the presence of even _ arbitrarily _ weak _ quenched _ disorder .",
    "furthermore , the decay of smectic translational order induced by such disorder is far more rapid than in previously studied `` bragg glass '' systems@xcite , being exponential , rather than algebraic .",
    "the experimental signature of this is equally unequivocal : broad x - ray scattering peaks with finite peak height , as opposed to the infinitely sharp , divergent peaks associated with quasi - long ranged order in thermal smectics .    this qualitative prediction is born out by all experiments on smectics in aerogel to date : all show only broad , finite height x - ray scattering peaks , which can be fit by assuming a finite x - ray correlation length.@xcite    in strong contrast to _ quenched _ ( frozen ) disorder of this type , it is straightforward to show analytically that weak short - ranged `` _ annealed _ '' disorder , in which the random environment can rearrange to accomodate the smectic s preference for an ordered state , has no _ qualitative _ effect on the long scale properties of liquid crystal phases .",
    "such weak annealed disorder only leads to _ finite _ renormalizations of the effective parameters in our model.@xcite consequently , the smectic phase , its quasi - long - ranged smectic translational order , and the transition into it are _ stable to weak annealed _ disorder , which might arise , for example , due to a low concentration of microscopic inclusions .    of course , strictly speaking , all physical random confining structure are elastic , even aerogel , and therefore are able to deform to some extent in response to the smectic , which resists distortions .",
    "it is easy to see that this additional `` elastic compliance '' ingredient can be described as an annealed component of the disorder , in addition to the quenched part that is the main subject of our work . in light of the qualitative unimportance of weak annealed disorder ,",
    "discussed above , our theory for purely quenched random structures immediately extends to deformable structures , which are quenched for large deformations , i.e. described by a finite shear modulus .",
    "a notable example of liquid crystals confined in random structure in which these elastic annealed features appear are the recent experiments on smectics in _",
    "aerosil_.@xcite since _ typical _ weak hydrogen bonds that link the aerosil network together have bond - breaking energies of order @xmath1011 , a large fraction of the aerosil network can rearrange itself in response to stresses imposed on it by the smectic and thereby come to thermal equilibrium with it .",
    "however , measurements@xcite show that even these tenuous , weakly - bonded structures are characterized by a small but a _ finite _ shear modulus .",
    "hence even aerosils are unable to perform arbitrary rearrangements to equilibrate with the ordered smectic .",
    "therefore , while they have a large annealed component , aerosils contain a small quenched component , which dominates the qualitative physics of the confined smectic .",
    "we therefore expect a destruction of the quasi - long - ranged translational order for smectics confined in aerosils , with the x - ray correlation length obeying our predictions for low density aerogels .    however , there are three important consequences of the large annealed disorder component present in aerosils .",
    "firstly , while _ weak annealed _ disorder should only lead to a finite renormalization of effective parameters , _ strong _ annealed disorder can destroy the quasi - long - ranged smectic order by driving some of the effective elastic moduli negative .",
    "secondly , given the empirical fact that the _ bulk _ na transition appears to display non - universal behavior,@xcite we would expect this non - universality to also manifest itself for smectics `` confined '' in low - density aerosils , where the effective model parameters are functions of aerosil density due to the presence of the annealed disorder component .",
    "thirdly , because of this large annealed disorder component in aerosils and a correspondingly small quenched component , we expect aerosils to be described by significantly smaller values of our effective quenched disorder parameters @xmath37 and @xmath36 than for aerogels of the same solid volume fraction .",
    "consequently , experiments in aerosils are more appropriate for exploring our weak quenched disorder theory and to search for the delicate and `` fragile '' sbg and neg phases .",
    "these nontrivial qualitative predictions are clearly in agreement with the experimental observations of smectics confined in aerosils@xcite : ( i ) for low aerosil densities these experiments observe significantly longer ( than in equivalent volume fractions aerogels ) , finite smectic x - ray correlation lengths , ( ii ) they measure heat capacities with aerosil density dependent ( and therefore nonuniversal ) exponents , and ( iii ) in aerosils beyond a critical density they find a behavior that is qualitatively similar to smectics confined in aerogels .",
    "it is important to note that in aerogels and aerosils , in contrast to what one might have naively expected , the smectic correlation length is _ not _ limited by some sort of `` finite size '' effect associated with the `` pore size '' of the aerogel .",
    "that is , the smectic confined in aerogel does _ not _ act as if it has simply been broken up into many small volumes which do not interact with each other .",
    "if this `` finite size '' scenario _ were _ the case , one would expect to see the smectic translational correlation length @xmath4 grow with decreasing temperature as @xmath47 approached the pure @xmath1012 transition temperature @xmath1013 from above exactly as it did in the pure ( bulk ) smectic .",
    "indeed , one would expect it to track its temperature dependent value @xmath1014 in the pure system until @xmath47 got close enough to @xmath1013 that @xmath1015= @xmath1016 , the `` pore size '' of the aerogel . at this point @xmath100 would abruptly saturate , and remain constant at @xmath1017 for all lower temperatures .",
    "this is emphatically _ not _ what is seen in experiments on aerogels.@xcite rather the growth of @xmath4 continues right through @xmath1013 , and only saturates at some temperature well below @xmath1013 .",
    "this is completely consistent with our picture , in which @xmath4 is determined by a competition between the smectic elasticity , which tries to keep the system ordered , and the random forces exerted by the aerogel strands , which disorder it . in this picture",
    ", the saturation of @xmath4 with decreasing temperature occurs not _ above _",
    "@xmath1013 , but , rather , well _ below _ @xmath1013 ; specifically , at the temperature at which the smectic elastic compression modulus @xmath83 saturates .",
    "liquid crystals have also been confined in other random but significantly more ordered structures .",
    "some examples are anopore@xcite and vycor@xcite , which in contrast to the tenuous aerogel strand structure present on all scales , consist of a random distribution of empty pores , with fairly regular wall structure and much narrower pore size distribution .",
    "even these systems can in principle be understood within the general model presented here .",
    "however , they fall into the strong disorder regime of our model , and we are therefore unable to utilize our weak disorder approach to make quantitative predictions , aside from the observation that the quasi - long - ranged smectic order should be destroyed in these systems as well , consistent with experiments .    the qualitative agreement between our theory and experiment can be made quantitative through our expression eq.[xix ] , which relates @xmath4 to the smectic elastic constant @xmath83 . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "this expression implies that sufficiently far below @xmath1013 ( where our weak disorder theory applies ) , a simple power - law relation between @xmath100 and the `` bare '' layer compressional modulus @xmath1018 of the pure system holds :    @xmath1019^{\\zeta/2\\chi}\\;,\\\\ & \\propto&\\left[b_{\\rm bare}(t)\\right]^{1/\\chi-1/2}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ xixtb ]    the bare @xmath1018 can be determined in a number of ways .",
    "one way is simply to measure the layer compressional modulus @xmath1020 of a pure ( bulk , aerogel - free ) sample of the same smectic liquid crystal material , and pray that this is not changed when the smectic is placed in aerogel .",
    "however , since prayers are not always answered , a direct , simultaneous in - situ determination of @xmath1021 in the smectic inside the aerogel is clearly desirable .",
    "this could be done by determining the squared magnitude of the smectic order parameter @xmath1022 from , e.g. , the integrated intensity under the ( broadened ) smectic x - ray peak . in mean - field theory , which should hold for bare quantities sufficiently far below @xmath17 , @xmath1023 .",
    "thus , we should , in this mean - field regime , observe a universal power - law relation between the x - ray correlation length @xmath4 and @xmath1022 : @xmath1024 .",
    "note that in the absence of anomalous elasticity , the second regime of eq.[xix ] ( @xmath1025 ) would apply , and we would get @xmath1026 , the last proportionality holding only in the mean - field regime . thus , _ any _ departure of the @xmath4-@xmath19 relation from linearity is evidence for anomalous elasticity .",
    "furthermore , observing such a power - law relation determines @xmath74 .",
    "preliminary analysis of @xmath4 versus @xmath19 data@xcite , as determined above , supports the relation eq.[xixtb ] , with @xmath1027 .",
    "note that @xmath149 , favoring _ stability _ of the smectic bragg glass phase , although we have , as yet , no experimental way of determining if the other necessary relation for the stability of the sbg , namely @xmath153 , is satisfied .    while our prediction for @xmath100 is not as quantitative as we would like , since we do not have quantitatively reliable predictions for @xmath27 and @xmath74 in @xmath1 ( our @xmath733-expansion results not being quantitatively trustworthy when @xmath676 ) , it nonetheless makes it possible , by experimentally determining @xmath103 for _ one _ smectic in _",
    "one _ aerogel , to predict the temperature dependence of @xmath4 for _ any _ smectic in _ any _ low density aerogel .",
    "furthermore , once @xmath103 is known , @xmath27 and @xmath74 separately are also known , since @xmath114 .",
    "knowledge of these exponents then makes other predictions possible .",
    "in particular , it leads to our second prediction which concerns whether or not the transition ( which replaces the na transition in bulk smectics ) from the nematic to the low - temperature phase ( which replaces the ordered smectic ) is destroyed by disorder .",
    "surprisingly , this question can , in principle , have a different answer than the question of whether or not smectic translational order is destroyed .",
    "this is because our analysis shows that , even though smectic translational order _ is always _ destroyed , a distinct `` smectic bragg glass '' phase ( sbg ) , in which dislocations remain bound and long - ranged _ orientational _ ( nematic ) order persists , maybe possible in the presence of sufficiently weak disorder .",
    "if it is , then a thermodynamically sharp transition into it ( with decreasing temperature ) replaces the na transition of the pure system , as this phase itself replaces the smectic - a phase .",
    "consequently , an exotic and quite unique feature of this transition is that , while thermodynamic quantities ( e.g. , heat capacity ) display singularities at the transition to the putative smectic bragg glass , the x - ray scattering peak remains broad through the transition .",
    "unfortunately , whether or not this ( sbg ) phase exists , in principle , depends on whether or not the imprecisely known anomalous exponents @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfy the bounds eq.[bounds12 ] .",
    "fortunately , the above - described experimental determination of @xmath74 could answer this question , since one of the bounds eq.[bound_orientations ] is simply @xmath149 .",
    "thus , if the x - ray measurements , described above , find @xmath149 , a sbg phase can exist , and a thermodynamically sharp remnant of the pure system s na transition could be seen in sufficiently low density aerogels . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath74 proves to be @xmath115 , no sharp transition should be seen .",
    "this is a definite , falsifiable prediction that could be tested experimentally : if @xmath150 , no sharp transition should be seen .",
    "the converse conclusion , that if @xmath149 , a sharp transition should be seen , need not hold , since it is possible that @xmath149 , but the bound @xmath153 is violated .    for the same reason , even if the current experimental evidence that there is _ no _ transition even for arbitrarily low density aerogel holds up , we can _ not _ conclude that @xmath150 .",
    "it is also important to note , that despite of the absence of the long - ranged ordered smectic phase , it _ is _ possible , as always , to have a thermodynamically sharp _ first - order _ transition _ within _ the disordered ( nematic ) phase . at such transition , which would be from a nematic with a short smectic correlation length to a nematic with longer ( but still finite ) smectic correlation length , thermodynamic quantities ( like the heat capacity ) could displaying sharp non - analytic features ( like latent heat ) .",

    "although , as mentioned earlier , this term is subdominant to the first , disorder term , it could nonetheless be resolved by _ time - dependent _ light scattering .",

    "consistency of the two approaches would demonstrate the validity of the exact scaling relation between @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath1033 .",
    "we remind the avid experimentalist that the entire above discussion _ only _ applies if the sbg phase is stable .",

    "a detailed discussion of this problem is in preparation.@xcite    we expect a new glass phase similar in many respects to the `` m=1 '' glass described above , but in a different universality class , to occur when `` discotics '' ( i.e. liquid crystals with _ two solid_-like directions and _ one liquid_-like ) are absorbed into _ unstressed _ aerogel .",
    "work on this interesting problem is also currently underway.@xcite    it is also interesting to consider what happens to a _ cholesteric _",
    "liquid crystal confined in aerogel.@xcite although the symmetry of such a system is _ identical _ to that of a smectic studied here , the addition of another long length scale ( namely the cholesteric pitch ) may make it possible to access a novel type of `` random manifold '' regime of pinned elastic media .",
    "probably the most interesting and challenging problem is the theory of dynamics of these smectic bragg glass systems , which would enable a detailed understanding of recent dynamic light scattering experiments.@xcite if the smectic bragg glass phase exists , which we are quite certain it does in smectics in anisotropic aerogels and discotics in isotropic aerogels,@xcite it should have slow glassy dynamics similar to those observed by bellini et al.@xcite . given its unusual _",
    "static _ properties ( e.g. anomalous elasticity ) , its dynamics may be quite unusual , even for glasses .",
    "as noted in the introduction , here we have studied smectics in aerogel by perturbing around the low temperature translationally and orientational ordered smectic phase . however , another complementary approach to this problem , more convenient to understanding the effects of disorder near and above the bulk na transition , is based on de gennes model.@xcite this complementary high temperature approach makes it possible to predict , e.g. , the rounded specific heat and x - ray scattering peaks observed in many experiments on smectics in aerogel.@xcite    finally , we note that the formalism we developed in sec.[dislocations ] for disordered smectics can be applied to a variety of other disordered problems , including gauge glasses , randomly pinned abrikosov vortex lattices and other pinned periodic media . these applications will be discussed in a future publication.@xcite",
