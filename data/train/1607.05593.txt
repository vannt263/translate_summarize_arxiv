    "in particular , can one hear the existence of non - orbifold singularities , i.e.  whether or not an orbit space is an orbifold ?",

    "we study the inaudible properties of the isospectral non - isometric orbit spaces provided by theorem  [ main ] and prove theorem  [ main2 ] .",
    "negative inverse spectral results are realized by studying pairs of isospectral non - isometric spaces . the celebrated sunada technique @xcite provides a systematic method for producing such pairs .",
    "this technique has been generalized and applied in many different settings by modifying its various hypotheses . in this section",
    "we generalize the sunada - pesce - sutton @xcite technique to the @xmath0-invariant setting .",
    "we start by reviewing the original sunada technique and the various generalizations that lead to our @xmath0-invariant formulation .",
    "the original theorem concerns finite group actions and is stated in terms of _ almost conjugate _ subgroups of the isometry group .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite group and let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be subgroups of @xmath0 .",

    "we call the triple @xmath46 a _ sunada triple_.",
    "let @xmath46 be a sunada triple and @xmath2 a compact riemannian manifold on which @xmath0 acts by isometries .",
    "assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43 act freely .",
    "then @xmath47 and @xmath48 with the induced riemannian metrics are strongly isospectral as riemannian manifolds .",
    "a simple generalization of this theorem allows for the action to have fixed points ( i.e.  not necessarily free ) .",
    "one need only note that the hypothesis that the action be free is unnecessary in the proof of the theorem . using this generalization one can produce isospectral pairs of orbifolds , cf .",
    "* theorem 2.5 ) .",
    "it is precisely the hypothesis that the action be free that we will modify in the sunada - pesce - sutton generalization to produce pairs of isospectral non - isometric orbit spaces .",
    "one of the earliest and most fruitful generalizations of the original sunada theorem was provided by deturck and gordon @xcite .",
    "they allow @xmath0 to be a lie group and @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be representation equivalent cocompact discrete subgroups .",
    "if @xmath0 acts by isometries on a riemannian manifold @xmath2 in such a way that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are compact manifolds then these manifolds are strongly isospectral .",
    "the main advantage of their generalization is that the quotients no longer need be by finite subgroups of the isometry group .",
    "pesce @xcite weakened the hypothesis that the discrete subgroups @xmath42 and @xmath43 be representation equivalent , applying the idea of frobenius reciprocity in his proof .",
    "although the subgroups we use in theorem  [ main ] are representation equivalent , so that we do not need the generality of pesce s result , we mention it here because the version of sunada that we employ in the proof of theorem  [ main ] follows from sutton s generalization of pesce s result .    sutton ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) generalized the sunada - pesce technique from the setting of discrete subgroups to connected subgroups , allowing for the construction of the first locally non - isometric , simply - connected isospectral homogeneous manifolds .",
    "his theorem requires the action of the @xmath23 on @xmath2 to be free , but this assumption is made to ensure that the quotient spaces are manifolds , and is not necessary in his proof .",
    "indeed , the spaces @xmath49 in theorem  [ main ] need not be riemannian manifolds or orbifolds , but more generalized quotient spaces .",
    "sutton additionally requires in his theorem that the riemannian submersions @xmath50 have totally geodesic fibers in order to conclude that the eigenfunctions on @xmath49 lift to eigenfunctions on @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is unnecessary in our setting as we consider the @xmath23-invariant spectrum on @xmath51 as opposed to the spectrum of the laplacian acting on @xmath52 .",
    "we now state the @xmath0-invariant version of the sunada theorem that we will apply in this paper , noting that it follows directly from the pesce - sutton generalizations .",
    "indeed , we need only note that the the hypothesis that the action be free in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) is unnecessary in the proof of the theorem .",
    "moreover , sutton generalizes his own theorem in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.7 ) and the version stated below is a special case of this result , where again his assumption that @xmath50 have minimal fibers is unnecessary in the @xmath0-invariant setting .",
    "[ generalization ] let @xmath2 be a compact riemannian manifold and @xmath3 a compact lie group .",

    "* theorem 1.5 ) states that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are representation equivalent as subgroups of @xmath56 .",
    "the isospectrality of the spaces @xmath38 and @xmath39 then follows immediately from theorem  [ generalization ] .",
    "finally , we note that there are many geometric properties that distinguish these spaces as non - isometric .",
    "we catalogue these properties in section  [ examples ] .",
    "isometries of singular riemannian foliations and their spectral properties[smooth ]    preliminaries here , we recall some of the terminology of singular riemannian foliations , @xcite .",
    "a _ singular riemannian foliation _ on a manifold @xmath2 is a partition @xmath57 of @xmath2 by connected immersed submanifolds ( known as the leaves ) that satisfy the following two conditions :    1 .",
    "the module @xmath58 of smooth vector fields that are tangent to the leaves is transitive on each leaf in the sense that there exist a collection of smooth vector fields @xmath59 on @xmath2 such that for each @xmath60 the tangent space to the leaf @xmath61 through @xmath62 is spanned by the vectors @xmath59 .",
    "note that the dimension of the leaves may vary over the manifold .",
    "2 .   there exists a riemannian metric @xmath63 on @xmath2 that is adapted to @xmath57 in the sense that every geodesic that is perpendicular at one point to a leaf remains perpendicular to every leaf that it meets .",
    "in other words , the normal distribution to the leaves is totally geodesic .",
    "note that the dimension of the leaves may vary over the manifold .",
    "examples :    1 .   given a riemannian foliation @xmath64 , the partition of @xmath2 into leaf closures defines a singular riemannian foliation when the dimension of leaf closures is not necessarily constant .",
    "2 .   given a compact lie group acting on a compact manifold @xmath2 by isometries",
    ", the partition of @xmath2 into orbits defines a singular riemannian foliation .",
    "note : in the above situations , both examples produce singular riemannian foliations with closed leaves .",
    "in general , there is no requirement that a singular riemannian foliation should have closed leaves .",
    "however , when the leaves are closed , one can define a notion of a smooth structure on @xmath65 as well as a natural metric structure that is inherited from @xmath2 .",
    "a smooth function on a manifold that admits a singular riemannian foliation is said to be _ basic _ if it is constant on the leaves .",
    "we denote the set of such functions by @xmath66 if the singular riemannian foliation is given by an isometric @xmath0-action , then the basic functions are just the @xmath0-invariant functions , @xmath67    we define a smooth structure on @xmath65 to be the algebra @xmath68 consisting of functions @xmath69 whose pullback via @xmath70 is a smooth basic function on @xmath2 in the above sense . in the situation when the singular riemannian foliation arises from an isometric group action by a compact lie group",
    ", we can rephrase this as follows .",
    "a smooth structure on @xmath1 is the algebra of functions @xmath71 consisting of functions @xmath72 whose pullback via @xmath73 is a smooth @xmath0-invariant function on @xmath2 .",
    "thus , if @xmath74 is an open set in the topological space @xmath75 with the quotient topology , then the smooth structure is given by the sheaf of smooth functions @xmath76    [ d : smooth ] a map @xmath77 ( or more generally , @xmath78 ) is called _ smooth _ if the pullback of every smooth function @xmath79 by @xmath80 is a smooth function in @xmath81    * metric structure : * while the above situation is an example of an aleksandrov space , the metric structure is much stronger than the more general case of an aleksandrov space because the metric structure on the quotient comes from a smooth metric structure on the manifold @xmath82 certainly , the distance between points in the quotient is realized by the lengths of orthogonal geodesics connecting the orbits containing the preimages of the points in the quotient .",
    "but additionally , if @xmath83 denotes the union of orbits with minimal isotropy , then @xmath83 is open and dense in @xmath2 and @xmath84 is a riemannian submersion and thus @xmath85 is an isometry .",
    "even further , recall from either the theory of riemannian foliations ( see for example , @xcite ) or isometric group actions , @xcite , that the region of @xmath2 where the orbits are of maximal dimension is an open , dense set , which is at worst a riemannian orbifold , known as @xmath86 ( clearly , @xmath87 ) the set @xmath88 admits a riemannian foliation whose leaves are the orbits , and thus a transverse metric @xmath89 , such that @xmath90 has as its image a riemannian orbifold @xmath91 whose metric @xmath92 is isometric to @xmath89 in the sense that @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the laplacian on @xmath91 .",
    "it follows that for functions @xmath95 whose support lies in an open neighborhood @xmath74 of the image under @xmath96 of a point in @xmath88 , @xmath97 note : we do not posit the existence of anything like a laplacian operator on the entire quotient  just on the orbifold part of @xmath98    given the notion of a smooth srf isometry between orbit spaces in definition [ d : srfiso ] , it is natural to ask if the existence of such an isometry between orbit spaces @xmath12 and @xmath11 implies equality of the @xmath99-invariant spectra for @xmath100 . in other words , is @xmath101 we now prove theorem [ main4 ] which answers this question affirmatively .    with @xmath80 as above ,",
    "let @xmath102 for @xmath100 .",
    "then , for @xmath103 , @xmath104 applying @xmath105 to both sides , yields @xmath106 furthermore , from applied to our two quotient spaces , we have in the neighborhood of regular points , the following : @xmath107 and @xmath108    combining and with @xmath109 , we have @xmath110    now suppose @xmath111 is such that its restriction to @xmath112 is an eigenfunction of @xmath113 with eigenvalue @xmath114 then we have via , @xmath115 by continuity @xmath116 is a @xmath17-invariant eigenfunction of @xmath117 with eigenvalue @xmath118 .",
    "conversely , every @xmath119 that is an eigenfunction of @xmath117 with eigenvalue @xmath118 descends to an eigenfunction of @xmath113 with corresponding eigenvalue @xmath118 .    by , we now have @xmath120 but , by definition [ d : smooth ] , @xmath121 is a smooth @xmath15-invariant function on all of @xmath16 , as is @xmath122 .",
    "hence , by continuity , holds on all of @xmath16 , and @xmath123 finally , since @xmath80 has a smooth inverse , the reverse inclusion holds as well .",
    "we note the following additional property of smooth srf isometries .",
    "we recall first the definition of quotient codimension . for a quotient space @xmath124 ,",
    "if @xmath125 is a subset of @xmath2 saturated by orbits , then the quotient codimension of @xmath125 is defined to be : @xmath126    [ codim ] let @xmath127 denote the union of orbits in @xmath16 with quotient codimension @xmath128 , and let @xmath129 and similarly define @xmath130 . if @xmath80 is a smooth srf isometry between orbit spaces as above , then @xmath131 for each @xmath128 for which @xmath132 .",
    "recall that @xmath16 and @xmath18 are each stratified by a finite collection of sets @xmath133 respectively @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the union of orbits of dimension @xmath136 , and that the dimension of the orbits is lower semi - continuous , @xcite , and similarly for @xmath134 . here",
    "@xmath136 takes values from @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the maximum dimension of the orbits .",
    "hence , @xmath139 and @xmath140 and similarly for @xmath141 in fact , @xmath135 is open and dense in @xmath142 note , these stratifications may be a little finer than the stratifications by quotient codimension . by assumption , @xmath80 is a homeomorphism .",
    "it follows easily that when @xmath143 , @xmath144 contains @xmath145 and thus is dense with non - empty interior in @xmath12 and @xmath146 note : it follows that @xmath147 hence , @xmath80 restricts to a homeomorphism on the complements : @xmath148 let @xmath149 denote the first non - zero quotient codimension of @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath150 contains @xmath151 and thus is dense with non - empty interior in @xmath152 and so @xmath153 has the same property in @xmath154 further , it s dimension is equal to @xmath149 .",
    "it follows that @xmath149 is also the first non - zero quotient dimension in @xmath18 , and thus @xmath155 where the complements are taken in @xmath152 and @xmath154 this argument can be repeated finitely many times to show the conclusion .",
    "summary of results relating to the smoothness of isometries and some immediate consequences    in the literature , there are a number of situations in which smooth srf isometries between orbit spaces are known to exist .",
    "many of these arise from metric space isometries that are known to be , under certain circumstances , smooth in the sense of the previous subsection .",
    "these metric space isometries , in turn , come about because of standard reductions of the orbit spaces whereby one can replace the orbit space @xmath12 with another , typically simpler one , @xmath11 .",
    "examples of such reductions include the principal isotropy reduction , the minimal reduction , and the effectivization of a group action . note that in the literature quoted below , the word  diffeomorphism \" is used to mean a bijective map between orbit spaces which is smooth in the sense of the previous section , together with its inverse .",
    "hence @xmath156 in the context below is a smooth srf isometry .",
    "we make particular note of the following results , theorems 1.3 and 1.5 of @xcite , and theorem 1.1 of @xcite , which we state for future reference below :    let @xmath157 be the orbit space of an isometric group action on a riemannian manifold .",
    "if there is a metric space isometry @xmath158 , where @xmath91 is a smooth riemannian orbifold , then @xmath156 is a diffeomorphism ( a.  k.  a. , smooth srf isometry ) between the quotient smooth structure of @xmath159 and the underlying smooth orbifold structure of @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath157 and @xmath160 be of dimension at most 3 .",
    "then each isometry @xmath161 is a diffeomorphism ( a.  k.  a. , smooth srf isometry ) .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath18 be complete riemannian manifolds and @xmath162 @xmath163 be singular riemannian foliations with closed leaves .",
    "assume that there exists an isometry @xmath164 that preserves the codimension of the leaves .",
    "then @xmath80 is a smooth srf isometry .",
    "we see immediately that the results above together with theorem [ main4 ] yield the following corollaries which are interesting by themselves .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main5 ] also follows from this .",
    "recall that the orbifold spectrum of an orbifold @xmath19 is the @xmath165-invariant spectrum on the orthonormal frame bundle @xmath166 equipped with a riemannian metric that arises from the riemannian orbifold metric on @xmath167 the levi - civita connection and a bi - invariant metric on @xmath165 .",
    "thus , theorem 1.3 of @xcite and theorem [ main4 ] together imply that the @xmath0-invariant spectrum on @xmath2 coincides with the @xmath165-invariant spectrum on @xmath166 whenever the corresponding quotients are isometric as metric spaces .",
    "if the metric structure inherited from @xmath1 defines a riemannian orbifold structure , then we may take the trivial isometry ( the identity ) .",
    "the metric space structure of a riemannian orbifold @xmath19 determines its smooth structure and hence its spectrum .",
    "suppose there exists a metric space isometry @xmath80 between two riemannian orbifolds @xmath168 and @xmath169 then by theorem 1.5 of @xcite , @xmath80 is a smooth srf isometry .",
    "isospectrality now follows from theorem [ main4 ] .",
    "[ cor : lowdiso ] if the dimension of @xmath1 is 3 or less , then any reduction of the action of @xmath0 on @xmath2 to an action by a group @xmath170 on a smooth manifold @xmath171 via a metric space isometry between @xmath1 and @xmath172 is via a smooth srf isometry .",
    "hence the @xmath0-invariant spectrum on @xmath2 is equivalent to the @xmath170-invariant spectrum on @xmath171 .",

    "the reduction of the action to @xmath181 defines a metric space isometry @xmath184 between @xmath1 and @xmath181 in a trivial way , since this reduction is an orbit equivalence .",
