    "we made use of the july 2003 version of a compilation ( andernach et al .",
    "2004 ) of published redshifts and velocity dispersions ( @xmath5 ) of clusters from the abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 , aco ) catalogue .",
    "this version gives @xmath5 for 1595 abell / aco cluster components of 1240 unique abell / aco clusters ( 1002 a - clusters and 237 supplementary s - clusters ) , often with two or more components at different redshift @xmath6 ( subclusters or line - of - sight components ) .",
    "for the latter we take as the main cluster that component which minimizes @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 of @xmath9 component , @xmath10 photometric cluster redshift , @xmath11 total number of galaxy redshifts for that cluster , @xmath12 number of redshifts in the @xmath9 component ) .",
    "we define a corrected abell richness count as  @xmath13 , and keep only clusters with @xmath14 ( i.e.  abell richness @xmath15 ) .",
    "we use @xmath16kms@xmath17mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 to calculate distances . to limit ourselves to robust values of @xmath20 , we perform tests ( cf .  plionis et al .",
    "2004 for details ) and find that only for those 60% of clusters with @xmath21 may we consider @xmath20 as reliable .",
    "this also lowers the mean @xmath6 of our sample , implying that @xmath6 decreases with @xmath22 , i.e.  observers tend to study more thoroughly nearby clusters , while the well - sampled , distant clusters are likely the richest ones .",
    "the observed @xmath23 correlation in turn suggests a correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus , to further guarantee that our sample is a fair representation of the universal mix of poor and rich clusters , we perform further tests and restrict our sample to @xmath25 .",
    "this leaves a `` clean '' sample of velocity dispersions for 459 @xmath26 a - clusters ( excluding any secondary components ) with @xmath27 and @xmath25 .",
    "the median @xmath5 and its 67% and 33% quantiles are   @xmath28 the @xmath29 relation is @xmath30",
    "we derive the cluster mass from the virial theorem assuming clusters to be in dynamical equilibrium . if galaxies trace the underlying matter distribution we can write ( the & white 1986 ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 allows for the cluster not being fully enclosed within the sampling radius , and depends on the velocity anisotropy of galaxy orbits ( girardi et al .  1998 ; 2000 )",
    "the projected virial radius , @xmath33 , depends on the galaxy distribution of a particular cluster .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) express @xmath33 as function of the virial radius , @xmath34 , and the cluster core radius , @xmath35 ( katgert , biviano & mazure 2004 ) . with @xmath36 ( girardi et al .",
    "1998 ) we arrive to @xmath37 in the absence of data for individual clusters we take the median @xmath32=0.19 from girardi et al.(1998 ) .    for the cluster x - ray masses we use data from jones & forman ( 1999 , jf99 ) who determined gas masses and temperatures within 1 @xmath38mpc for @xmath39100 clusters in our sample .",
    "as our virial mass is that within @xmath34 we convert this mass to that within the common radius of 1  @xmath38 mpc to be comparable with the x - ray masses .",
    "we use a king profile for the cluster galaxy radial density distribution . we find a good correlation of virial and x - ray masses albeit with virial masses @xmath40 being systematically larger than x - ray masses @xmath41 .",
    "one reason may be an underestimate of  @xmath32 , while another could be that the virial assumption is not valid ( despite our careful selection of only clusters with either unimodal velocity distributions or the main component of multi - component clusters ) .",
    "assuming that x - ray masses are closer to the true cluster masses , we corrected our virial masses from @xmath40 to @xmath42 using the coefficients of the @xmath43@xmath44 fit .",
    "to determine the correlation between luminosity and cluster richness , we estimate the cluster luminosities using the locos sample ( lpez - cruz 1997 ; 2001 ) of 46 local x - ray selected abell clusters .",
    "lpez - cruz ( 1997 ) generated luminosity functions ( lf ) for each cluster , using color information to reduce background contamination , and fitted lfs with one or two schechter functions .",
    "we determined the locos cluster @xmath0-band luminosity , @xmath45 , by integrating the fitted lfs .    as the rest - frame area covered by each @xmath46 cluster frame is different for each cluster",
    ", we put the cluster luminosities on a common physical scale of one abell radius @xmath47mpc .",
    "instead of @xmath33 we use @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the luminosity distance @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath50 .",
    "as we have no measure of the optical luminosity for the majority of our 459 clusters , we estimate their luminosity from the @xmath51 correlation of the locos sample , valid for @xmath52 : @xmath53 this procedure gives a good approxiamtion to the overall distribution of luminosities .",
    "in order to derive consistent values of the cluster @xmath3 we reduce the optical luminosities to the same radius ( 1 @xmath55 mpc ) at which the cluster masses , corrected for the @xmath56 relation , were estimated .",
    "the distribution of the resulting 459 @xmath3 values is slightly non - gaussian , and the median with 67% and 33% quantiles is   @xmath57 we test the robustness of our procedure by estimating @xmath3 for two different cluster subsamples for which we have individually - determined x - ray masses and/or luminosities : ( a ) for the 34 clusters the locos and jf99 samples have in common , we use directly the individual @xmath0-band luminosities and x - ray masses , and find ( within @xmath58 mpc ) : @xmath59  ( b ) for 146 clusters of jf99 , using x - ray masses from jf99 and optical luminosities from our @xmath60 relation , we obtain   @xmath61    to compare our results with those of other studies we translate them to the @xmath0 band using typical colors of early - type galaxies : @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( girardi et al .",
    "2002 ) and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , from which we obtain @xmath66  and   @xmath67 from @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( eke et al .",
    "2004 ) we obtain @xmath70 based on a study of eight clusters with well - determined asca x - ray masses , hradecky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find @xmath71 while girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , based on virial masses , obtained @xmath72 both in good agreement with our results .    using the virial masses directly , not correcting for the @xmath73 relation",
    ", we obtain @xmath74 , also in excellent agreement with recent studies based either on virial or weak - lensing cluster mass estimations . for example , eke et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using rich galaxy groups in 2dfgrs , find @xmath75 , while sanderson & ponman ( 2003 ) , based on 66 virialized systems , find @xmath76 .",
    "finally , hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2002 ) using an hst weak - lensing analysis of four clusters find @xmath77 .",
    "we seem to confirm a dichotomy in recent determinations of cluster @xmath3 ratios which in our case is due to x - ray masses systematically lower than virial masses .",
    "since galaxy clusters are the deepest potential wells in the universe , and they accumulate baryonic and dark matter from large volumes , it is assumed that their @xmath3 ratio should represent the universal value .",
    "therefore , in order to derive the value of @xmath78 we need to derive the universal luminosity density , @xmath79 , by integrating the @xmath0-band luminosity function of field galaxies .",
    "although the functional form of the field galaxy lf is a schechter function , the lf parameters vary from survey to survey ( brown et al .",
    "the only field - galaxy survey with the same observational set - up ( filters , ccd detector , telescope ) as locos , is the century survey ( cs ; geller et al .",
    "the resulting schechter lf ( brown et al .  2001 ) has parameters   @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 which then gives @xmath83 in good agreement with the value derived from 2dfgrs ( norberg et al .",
    "then the universal @xmath3 ratio is given by   @xmath84 where the critical density is @xmath85 .",
    "as a further comparison we note that the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath86 luminosity function , extrapolated to redshift @xmath87 and based on @xmath88 galaxies ( blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) , has @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "shifting to the cousins-@xmath0 band used in locos , according to @xmath92 ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) , we obtain a larger value of the luminosity density : @xmath93 , which results in a universal @xmath94 .",
    "it is now straightforward to obtain the value of @xmath78 , which for the case of the virial cluster masses is   @xmath95 for the cs and sdss luminosity functions , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values for the x - ray based cluster masses are   @xmath96 only the former values are consistent with the _ concordance _ cosmological model .",
    "we used the virial theorem to estimate the total gravitating mass for a sample of 459 abell / aco clusters with robust velocity dispersions .",
    "their @xmath0-band luminosities were estimated from a relation between abell galaxy counts and luminosity , based on 46 abell clusters with accurate @xmath0-band ccd photometry .",
    "the resulting median @xmath3 ratio of the subsample analysed is @xmath97 , if virial masses are used , and @xmath98 , if the x - ray based cluster masses are used . comparing with the universal @xmath3 value",
    ", we obtain a mass content of the universe of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
