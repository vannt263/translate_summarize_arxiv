    "quantum chromodynamics is a theory with remarkably novel and interesting features .",
    "heavy ion experiments at rhic  @xcite are now discovering unexpected new phenomena associated with the high temperature phase of qcd where its quark and gluon degrees of freedom become manifest .",
    "experiments at hermes  @xcite have confirmed qcd expectations for leading - twist single - spin asymmetries which require both the presence of quark orbital angular momentum in the proton wavefunction and novel final - state qcd phases .",
    "experiments at hera  @xcite have shown that diffractive deep inelastic scattering , where the proton target remains intact , constitutes a remarkably large percentage of the deep inelastic cross section , again showing the importance of qcd final state interactions .",
    "the selex experiment  @xcite has shown that single , and even double - charm , hadrons are produced at high @xmath2 in hadron collisions in agreement with analyses based on the intrinsic charm  @xcite fluctuations of the proton .",
    "color transparency  @xcite , a key feature of the gauge theoretic description of hadron interactions , has now been experimentally established at fermilab  @xcite using diffractive dijet production @xmath3 .",
    "the fermilab experiment also provides a measurement of the valence light - front wavefunction of the pion  @xcite .",
    "a similar experiment at the lhc @xmath4 at the lhc could be used to measure the fundamental valence wavefunction of the proton  @xcite .",
    "the lhc , in both proton - proton and heavy ion collisions , will not only open up a new high energy frontier , but it will also be a superb machine for probing and testing qcd .",
    "the advent of new hadron physics accelerators , such as the 12 gev electron facility at jefferson laboratory , the fair anti - proton and heavy ion facilities at gsi , and the j - parc hadron facility will provide many new opportunities to test qcd in its natural domain .",
    "in addition , many novel features of qcd , such as timelike deeply virtual compton scattering and two - photon annihilation , can be probed at electron - positron colliders .    in this talk",
    "i will emphasize a number of aspects of qcd which seem to violate conventional wisdom :    \\(1 ) as recently noted by collins and qiu  @xcite , the traditional factorization formalism of perturbative qcd for high transverse momentum hadron production fails in detail because of initial- and final - state gluonic interactions .",
    "these interactions produce the sivers effect at leading twist  @xcite with different signs in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering and the drell - yan reaction  @xcite .",
    "double initial - state interactions  @xcite also produce anomalous angular effects , including the breakdown of the lam - tung relation  @xcite in the drell - yan process .",
    "\\(2 ) hard diffractive reactions such as diffractive deep inelastic lepton scattering @xmath5 are leading - twist , bjorken - scaling phenomena .",
    "in fact , as shown at hera  @xcite , nearly @xmath6 of the inclusive deep inelastic cross section leaves the proton intact .",
    "this is now understood to be due to final - state gluonic interactions of the struck quark with the proton s spectators  @xcite , contradicting models based on an intrinsic pomeron component of the proton .",
    "\\(3 ) as emphasized by lai , tung , and pumplin  @xcite , there are strong indications that the structure functions used to model charm and bottom quarks in the proton at large @xmath7 have been strongly underestimated , since they ignore intrinsic heavy quark fluctuations of hadron wavefunctions .",
    "the selex  @xcite discovery of @xmath8 and @xmath9 double - charm baryons at large @xmath2 reinforces other signals for the presence of heavy quarks at large momentum fractions in hadronic wavefunctions , a rigorous feature of intrinsic heavy quark fock states .",
    "this has strong consequences for the production of heavy hadrons , heavy quarkonia , and even the higgs at the lhc .",
    "intrinsic charm and bottom leads to substantial rates for heavy hadron production at high @xmath2  @xcite , as well as anomalous nuclear effects .",
    "\\(4 ) the existence of dynamical higher - twist processes in which a hadron interacts directly within a hard subprocess is a rigorous prediction of qcd .",
    "for example , in the case of the drell - yan reaction @xmath10 the virtual photon becomes longitudinally polarized at high @xmath2 , reflecting the spin of the pion entering the qcd hard subprocess  @xcite . in the case of high transverse momentum proton production",
    "the differential cross section @xmath11 scales as @xmath12 at fixed @xmath13  @xcite far from the @xmath14 to @xmath15 scaling predicted by pqcd  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the proton is produced directly in the hard subprocess , rather than by quark or gluon fragmentation .",
    "the color transparency  @xcite of the produced proton and the resulting lack of absorption in a nuclear medium can explain the paradoxical observation seen at rhic that more protons than pions are produced at high @xmath16 in high centrality heavy ion collisions .",
    "\\(5 ) a new understanding of nuclear shadowing and antishadowing has emerged based on the presence of multi - step coherent reactions involving leading twist diffractive reactions  @xcite .",
    "thus the nuclear shadowing of structure functions is a consequence of the lepton - nucleus collision ; it is not an intrinsic property of the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "the same analysis shows that antishadowing is _ not universal _ , but it depends in detail on the flavor of the quark or antiquark constituent  @xcite .",
    "\\(6 ) qcd predicts that a nucleus can not be described solely as nucleonic bound states . in the case of the deuteron",
    ", the six - quark wavefunction has five color - singlet components , only one of which can be identified with the @xmath17 state at long distances .",
    "these  hidden color \" components  @xcite play an essential role in nuclear dynamics at short distances .",
    "\\(7 ) spin correlations are now playing an essential role in hadron physics phenomenology , particularly in single - spin correlations which are found to be unexpectedly strong in hadroproduction at large @xmath2 and in the double - spin correlations which measure transversity .",
    "one of the most remarkable phenomena in hadron physics is the 4:1 ratio @xmath18 of parallel to antiparallel rates seen in large - angle elastic proton - proton scattering at @xmath19 gev  @xcite .",
    "this  exclusive transversity \" is a possible signal for the existence of @xmath20 resonances at the charm threshold  @xcite .",
    "the absence of transverse polarization of the @xmath21 produced at high transverse momentum in @xmath22 is a key difficulty for heavy quark phenomenology .",
    "\\(8 ) it is commonly believed that the renormalization scale entering the qcd coupling is an arbitrary parameter in perturbative qcd ; in fact , just as in abelian theory , the renormalization scale is a physical quantity , representing the summation of qcd vacuum polarization contributions to the gluon propagator in the skeleton expansion  @xcite . in general , multiple renormalization scales",
    "appear in a pqcd expression whenever multiple invariants appear in the reaction .",
    "these issues are discussed in the next section .",
    "these examples of unconventional wisdom highlight the need for a fundamental understanding the dynamics of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level .",
    "this is essential for understanding the description of phenomena such as the quantum mechanics of hadron formation , the remarkable effects of initial and final interactions , the origins of diffractive phenomena and single - spin asymmetries , and manifestations of higher - twist semi - exclusive hadron subprocesses .",
    "a central tool in these analyses is the light - front wavefunctions of hadrons , the frame - independent eigensolutions of the heisenberg equation for qcd   @xmath23 quantized at fixed light - front . given the light - front wavefunctions @xmath24 , one can compute a large range of exclusive and inclusive hadron observables .",
    "for example , the valence , sea - quark and gluon distributions are defined from the squares of the lfwfs summed over all fock states @xmath25 .",
    "form factors , exclusive weak transition amplitudes  @xcite such as @xmath26 and the generalized parton distributions  @xcite measured in deeply virtual compton scattering are ( assuming the  handbag \" approximation ) overlaps of the initial and final lfwfs with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "i will also discuss here a new approach  @xcite for determining light - front wavefunctions for qcd using the ads / cft correspondence between anti - de sitter space and conformal gauge theories .",
    "ads / cft provides an analytically tractable approximation to qcd in the regime where the qcd coupling is large and constant .",
    "in particular , there is an exact correspondence between the fifth - dimension coordinate @xmath0 of ads space and a specific impact variable @xmath1 which measures the separation of the quark constituents within the hadron in ordinary space - time .",
    "this connection allows one to compute the analytic form of the frame - independent light - front wavefunctions of mesons and baryons , the fundamental entities which encode hadron properties and allow the computation of exclusive scattering amplitudes .",
    "precise quantitative predictions of qcd are necessary to understand the backgrounds to new beyond - the - standard - model phenomena at the lhc .",
    "thus it is important to eliminate as best as possible all uncertainties in qcd predictions , including the elimination of renormalization scale and scheme ambiguities .",
    "it should be emphasized that the renormalization scale is _ not arbitrary _ in gauge theories .",
    "for example in qed , the renormalization scale in the usual gell mann - low scheme is exactly the photon virtuality : @xmath29 . this scale sums all vacuum polarization corrections into the dressed photon propagator of a given skeleton graph .",
    "the resulting analytic qed running coupling has dispersive cuts set correctly set at the physical thresholds for lepton pair production @xmath30 .",
    "( in @xmath31 scheme , the renormalization scales are displaced to @xmath32 . )",
    "the renormalization scale is similarly unambiguous in qcd : the cuts due to quark loops in the dressed gluon propagator appear at the physical quark thresholds .",
    "equivalently , one can use the scheme - independent blm procedure  @xcite to eliminate the appearance of the @xmath33-function in the perturbative series .",
    "of course the _ initial choice _ of the renormalization scale is completely arbitrary , and one can study the dependence of a perturbative expansion on the initial scale using the usual renormalization group evolution equations .",
    "this procedure exposes the @xmath34dependent terms in the pqcd expression . eliminating the @xmath33-dependent terms then leads to a unique , physical , renormalization scale for any choice of renormalization scheme . in effect",
    ", one identifies the series for the corresponding conformal theory where the @xmath34 function is zero ; the conformal expression serves as a template  @xcite for perturbative qcd expansions ; the nonzero qcd @xmath33-function can then be systematically incorporated into the scale of the running coupling  @xcite .",
    "this leads to fixing of the physical renormalization scale as well as commensurate scale relations which relate observables to each other without scale or scheme ambiguity  @xcite .",
    "as an example , consider higgs production @xmath35 calculated via @xmath36 fusion .",
    "the physical renormalization scale for the running qcd couplings for this subprocess in the pinch scheme are the two gluon virtualities , not the higgs mass .",
    "the resulting values for the renormalization scales parallel the two - photon process in qed : @xmath37 where only vacuum polarization corrections determine the scale ; i.e. , the renormalization scales are set by the photon virtualities .",
    "an interesting consequence is the prediction that the qcd coupling is evaluated at the minimal scale of the gluon virtualities if the higgs is measured at @xmath38 .    in a physical renormalization scheme",
    "@xcite , gauge couplings are defined directly in terms of physical observables .",
    "such effective charges are analytic functions of the physical scales and their mass thresholds have the correct threshold dependence  @xcite consistent with unitarity . as in qed ,",
    "heavy particles contribute to physical predictions even at energies below their threshold .",
    "this is in contrast to renormalization schemes such as @xmath39 where mass thresholds are treated as step functions . in the case of supersymmetric grand unification ,",
    "one finds a number of qualitative differences and improvements in precision over conventional approaches  @xcite .",
    "the analytic threshold corrections can be important in making the measured values of the gauge couplings consistent with unification .",
    "relations between observables have no scale ambiguity and are independent of the choice of the intermediate renormalization scheme  @xcite ; this is the transitivity property of the renormalization group . the results , called commensurate scale relations , are consistent  @xcite with the renormalization group  @xcite and the analytic connection of qcd to abelian theory at @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "a important example is the generalized crewther relation  @xcite .",
    "one finds a renormalization - scheme invariant relation between the coefficient function for the bjorken sum rule for polarized deep inelastic scattering and the @xmath41-ratio for the @xmath42 annihilation cross section .",
    "this relation provides a generalization of the crewther relation to non - conformally invariant gauge theories .",
    "the derived relations allow one to calculate unambiguously without renormalization scale or scheme ambiguity the effective charges of the polarized bjorken and the gross - llewellen smith sum rules from the experimental value for the effective charge associated with @xmath41-ratio .",
    "present data are consistent with the generalized crewther relations , but measurements at higher precision and energies are needed to decisively test these fundamental relations in qcd .",
    "recently michael binger and i  @xcite have analyzed the behavior of the thirteen nonzero form factors contributing to the gauge - invariant three - gluon vertex at one - loop , an analysis which is important for setting the renormalization scale for heavy quark production and other pqcd processes .",
    "supersymmetric relations between scalar , quark , and gluon loops contributions to the triangle diagram lead to a simple presentation of the results for a general non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "only the gluon contribution to the form factors is needed since the massless quark and scalar contributions are inferred from the homogeneous relation @xmath43 and the sums @xmath44 which are given for each form factor @xmath45 .",
    "the extension to the case of internal masses leads to the modified sum rule @xmath46 .",
    "the phenomenology of the three - gluon vertex is largely determined by the form factor multiplying the three - level tensor .",
    "one can define a three - scale effective scale @xmath47 as a function of the three external virtualities which provides a natural extension of blm scale setting @xcite to the three - gluon vertex .",
    "physical momentum scales thus set the scale of the coupling .",
    "the dependence of @xmath48 on the physical scales has a number of surprising features . a complicated threshold and pseudo - threshold behavior is also observed .",
    "one of the most interesting new developments in hadron physics has been the application of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite to nonperturbative qcd problems  @xcite . already ads / cft is giving important insight into the viscosity and other global properties of the hadronic system formed in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the essential ansatz for the application of ads / cft to hadron physics is the indication that the qcd coupling @xmath49 becomes large and constant in the low momentum domain @xmath50 gev / c , thus providing a window where conformal symmetry can be applied .",
    "solutions of the qcd dyson schwinger equations  @xcite and phenomenological studies  @xcite of qcd couplings based on physical observables such as @xmath51 decay  @xcite and the bjorken sum rule show that the qcd @xmath33 function vanishes and @xmath49 become constant at small virtuality ; _ i.e. _ , effective charges develop an infrared fixed point .",
    "recent lattice gauge theory simulations  @xcite and nonperturbative analyses  @xcite have also indicated an infrared fixed point for qcd .",
    "one can understand this physically  @xcite : in a confining theory where gluons have an effective mass or maximal wavelength , all vacuum polarization corrections to the gluon self - energy decouple at long wavelength .",
    "when the coupling is constant and quark masses can be ignored , the qcd lagrangian becomes conformally invariant  @xcite , allowing the mathematically tools of conformal symmetry to be applied .",
    "the leading power fall - off of the hard scattering amplitude as given by dimensional counting rules follows from the conformal scaling of the underlying hard - scattering amplitude : @xmath52 , where @xmath25 is the total number of fields ( quarks , leptons , or gauge fields ) participating in the hard scattering  @xcite . thus the reaction is dominated by subprocesses and fock states involving the minimum number of interacting fields . in the case of @xmath53 scattering processes , this implies @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the minimum number of constituents of @xmath57 .",
    "the near - constancy of the effective qcd coupling helps explain the empirical success of dimensional counting rules for the near - conformal power law fall - off of form factors and fixed angle scaling  @xcite .",
    "for example , one sees the onset of perturbative qcd scaling behavior even for exclusive nuclear amplitudes such as deuteron photodisintegration ( here @xmath58 ) @xmath59 constant at fixed cm angle .",
    "the measured deuteron form factor also appears to follow the leading - twist qcd predictions at large momentum transfers in the few gev region  @xcite .",
    "recently the hall a collaboration at jefferson laboratory  @xcite has reported a significant exception to the general empirical success of dimensional counting in fixed cm angle compton scattering @xmath60 instead of the predicted @xmath61 scaling .",
    "however , the hadron form factor @xmath62 , which multiplies the @xmath63 amplitude is found by hall - a to scale as @xmath64 , in agreement with the pqcd and ads / cft prediction .",
    "in addition the timelike two - photon process @xmath65 appears to satisfy dimensional counting  @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the @xmath33 function at small momentum transfer implies that there is regime where qcd resembles a strongly - coupled theory and mathematical techniques based on conformal invariance can be applied .",
    "one can use the ads / cft correspondence between anti - de sitter space and conformal gauge theories to obtain an approximation to nonperturbative qcd in the regime where the qcd coupling is large and constant ; i.e. , one can use the mathematical representation of the conformal group @xmath66 in five- dimensional anti - de sitter space to construct a holographic representation to the theory . for example , guy de teramond and i  @xcite have shown that the amplitude @xmath67 describing the hadronic state in the fifth dimension of anti - de sitter space @xmath68 can be precisely mapped to the light - front wavefunctions @xmath69 of hadrons in physical space - time , thus providing a description of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level .",

    "these dual hadronic components become more and more important as one probes the deuteron at short distances , such as in exclusive reactions at large momentum transfer . for example , the ratio + @xmath190 should increase dramatically to a fixed ratio @xmath191 with increasing transverse momentum @xmath192 similarly the coulomb dissociation of the deuteron into various exclusive channels @xmath193 should have a changing composition as the final - state hadrons are probed at high transverse momentum , reflecting the onset of hidden color degrees of freedom .",
    "recently the cleo collaboration  @xcite has measured the branching ratios of + @xmath194 .",

    "a remarkable feature of deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering at hera is that approximately 10% events are diffractive  @xcite : the target proton remains intact , and there is a large rapidity gap between the proton and the other hadrons in the final state .",
    "these diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) events can be understood most simply from the perspective of the color - dipole model : the @xmath198 fock state of the high - energy virtual photon diffractively dissociates into a diffractive dijet system .",
    "the exchange of multiple gluons between the color dipole of the @xmath198 and the quarks of the target proton neutralizes the color separation and leads to the diffractive final state .",

    "this observation presents a paradox : if one chooses the conventional parton model frame where the photon light - front momentum is negative @xmath199 , the virtual photon interacts with a quark constituent with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath200 furthermore , the gauge link associated with the struck quark ( the wilson line ) becomes unity in light - cone gauge @xmath201 .",

    "the final - state interactions occur at a light - cone time @xmath205 shortly after the virtual photon interacts with the struck quark .",
    "when one integrates over the nearly - on - shell intermediate state , the amplitude acquires an imaginary part .",

    "the calculation of the rescattering effects on dis in feynman and light - cone gauge through three loops is given in detail for an abelian model in reference  @xcite .",
    "the result shows that the rescattering corrections reduce the magnitude of the dis cross section in analogy to nuclear shadowing .",
    "a new understanding of the role of final - state interactions in deep inelastic scattering has thus emerged .",
    "the multiple scattering of the struck parton via instantaneous interactions in the target generates dominantly imaginary diffractive amplitudes , giving rise to an effective  hard pomeron \" exchange .",

    "one can augment the light - front wave functions with a gauge link corresponding to an external field created by the virtual photon @xmath198 pair current  @xcite .",
    "such a gauge link is process dependent  @xcite , so the resulting augmented lfwfs are not universal @xcite",
    ". we also note that the shadowing of nuclear structure functions is due to the destructive interference between multi - nucleon amplitudes involving diffractive dis and on - shell intermediate states with a complex phase .",
    "in contrast , the wave function of a stable target is strictly real since it does not have on - energy - shell intermediate state configurations .",
    "the physics of rescattering and shadowing is thus not included in the nuclear light - front wave functions , and a probabilistic interpretation of the nuclear dis cross section is precluded .",
    "rikard enberg , paul hoyer , gunnar ingelman and i  @xcite have shown that the quark structure function of the effective hard pomeron has the same form as the quark contribution of the gluon structure function .",
    "the hard pomeron is not an intrinsic part of the proton ; rather it must be considered as a dynamical effect of the lepton - proton interaction .",
    "our qcd - based picture also applies to diffraction in hadron - initiated processes .",
    "the rescattering is different in virtual photon- and hadron - induced processes due to the different color environment , which accounts for the observed non - universality of diffractive parton distributions .",

    "among the most interesting polarization effects are single - spin azimuthal asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering , representing the correlation of the spin of the proton target and the virtual photon to hadron production plane : @xmath212 .",
    "such asymmetries are time - reversal odd , but they can arise in qcd through phase differences in different spin amplitudes .",
    "in fact , final - state interactions from gluon exchange between the outgoing quarks and the target spectator system lead to single - spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering which are not power - law suppressed at large photon virtuality @xmath104 at fixed @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the ssas arising from transversity and the collins fragmentation function , the fragmentation of the quark into hadrons is not necessary ; one predicts a correlation with the production plane of the quark jet itself .",
    "physically , the final - state interaction phase arises as the infrared - finite difference of qcd coulomb phases for hadron wave functions with differing orbital angular momentum .",

    "the ssa in the drell - yan process is the same as that obtained in sidis , with the appropriate identification of variables , but with the opposite sign .",
    "there is no sivers effect in charged - current reactions since the @xmath218 only couples to left - handed quarks  @xcite .",
    "if both the quark and antiquark in the initial state of the drell - yan subprocess @xmath219 interact with the spectators of the other incident hadron , one finds a breakdown of the lam - tung relation , which was formerly believed to be a general prediction of leading - twist qcd .",
    "these double initial - state interactions also lead to a @xmath220 planar correlation in unpolarized drell - yan reactions  @xcite .",
    "more generally one must consider subprocesses involving initial - state gluons such as @xmath221 in addition to subprocesses with extra final - state gluons .",
    "the final - state interaction mechanism provides an appealing physical explanation within qcd of single - spin asymmetries .",
    "remarkably , the same matrix element which determines the spin - orbit correlation @xmath213 also produces the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton , the pauli form factor , and the generalized parton distribution @xmath214 which is measured in deeply virtual compton scattering .",
    "physically , the final - state interaction phase arises as the infrared - finite difference of qcd coulomb phases for hadron wave functions with differing orbital angular momentum .",
    "an elegant discussion of the sivers effect including its sign has been given by burkardt  @xcite . as shown recently by gardner and myself  @xcite , one can also use the sivers effect to study the orbital angular momentum of gluons by tagging a gluon jet in semi - inclusive dis . in this case , the final - state interactions are enhanced by the large color charge of the gluons .",
    "the final - state interaction effects can also be identified with the gauge link which is present in the gauge - invariant definition of parton distributions  @xcite . even when the light - cone gauge is chosen , a transverse gauge link is required .",
    "thus in any gauge the parton amplitudes need to be augmented by an additional eikonal factor incorporating the final - state interaction and its phase  @xcite .",

    "the diffractive nuclear amplitude extrapolated to @xmath228 should be linear in nuclear number @xmath229 if color transparency is correct .",

    "the measured momentum fraction distribution of the jets with high transverse momentum is found to be approximately consistent with the shape of the pion asymptotic distribution amplitude , @xmath231  @xcite ; however , there is an indication from the data that the distribution is broader at lower transverse momentum , consistent with the ads / cft prediction .",
    "color transparency , as evidenced by the fermilab measurements of diffractive dijet production , implies that a pion can interact coherently throughout a nucleus with minimal absorption , in dramatic contrast to traditional glauber theory based on a fixed @xmath232 cross section .",
    "color transparency gives direct validation of the gauge interactions of qcd .",
    "color transparency has also been observed in diffractive electroproduction of @xmath233 mesons  @xcite and in quasi - elastic @xmath234 scattering  @xcite where only the small size fluctuations of the hadron wavefunction enters the hard exclusive scattering amplitude . in the latter case",
    "an anomaly occurs at @xmath235 gev , most likely signaling a resonance effect at the charm threshold  @xcite .",
    "one of the novel features of qcd involving nuclei is the _ antishadowing _ of the nuclear structure functions which is observed in deep inelastic lepton scattering and other hard processes .",
    "empirically , one finds @xmath236 in the domain @xmath237 ; _ i.e. _ , the measured nuclear structure function ( referenced to the deuteron ) is larger than than the scattering on a set of @xmath229 independent nucleons .",
    "the shadowing of the nuclear structure functions : @xmath238 at small @xmath239 can be readily understood in terms of the gribov - glauber theory .",
    "consider a two - step process in the nuclear target rest frame .",
    "the incoming @xmath198 dipole first interacts diffractively @xmath240 on nucleon @xmath241 leaving it intact .",
    "this is the leading - twist diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) process which has been measured at hera to constitute approximately 10% of the dis cross section at high energies .",
    "the @xmath198 state then interacts inelastically on a downstream nucleon @xmath242 @xmath243 .",
    "the phase of the pomeron - dominated ddis amplitude is close to imaginary , and the glauber cut provides another phase @xmath244 , so that the two - step process has opposite phase and destructively interferes with the one - step dis process @xmath245 where @xmath241 acts as an unscattered spectator",
    ". the one - step and - two step amplitudes can coherently interfere as long as the momentum transfer to the nucleon @xmath241 is sufficiently small that it remains in the nuclear target ; _ i.e. _ , the ioffe length  @xcite @xmath246 is large compared to the inter - nucleon separation . in effect , the flux reaching the interior nucleons is diminished , thus reducing the number of effective nucleons and @xmath247    there are also leading - twist diffractive contributions @xmath248 arising from reggeon exchanges in the @xmath71-channel  @xcite .",
    "for example , isospin  non - singlet @xmath249 reggeons contribute to the difference of proton and neutron structure functions , giving the characteristic kuti - weisskopf @xmath250 behavior at small @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath114 dependence of the structure functions reflects the regge behavior @xmath251 of the virtual compton amplitude at fixed @xmath104 and @xmath252 the phase of the diffractive amplitude is determined by analyticity and crossing to be proportional to @xmath253 for @xmath254 which together with the phase from the glauber cut , leads to _ constructive _ interference of the diffractive and nondiffractive multi - step nuclear amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , because of its @xmath114 dependence , the nuclear structure function is enhanced precisely in the domain @xmath255 where antishadowing is empirically observed .",
    "the strength of the reggeon amplitudes is fixed by the fits to the nucleon structure functions , so there is little model dependence .    as noted above , the bjorken - scaling diffractive contribution to dis arises from the rescattering of the struck quark after it is struck ( in the parton model frame @xmath256 ) , an effect induced by the wilson line connecting the currents .",
    "thus one can not attribute ddis to the physics of the target nucleon computed in isolation  @xcite .",
    "similarly , since shadowing and antishadowing arise from the physics of diffraction , we can not attribute these phenomena to the structure of the nucleus itself : shadowing and antishadowing arise because of the @xmath257 collision and the history of the @xmath198 dipole as it propagates through the nucleus .",
    "ivan schmidt , jian - jun yang , and i  @xcite have extended the glauber analysis to the shadowing and antishadowing of all of the electroweak structure functions .",
    "quarks of different flavors will couple to different reggeons ; this leads to the remarkable prediction that nuclear antishadowing is not universal ; it depends on the quantum numbers of the struck quark .",
    "this picture implies substantially different antishadowing for charged and neutral current reactions , thus affecting the extraction of the weak - mixing angle @xmath258 .",
    "we find that part of the anomalous nutev result  @xcite for @xmath258 could be due to the non - universality of nuclear antishadowing for charged and neutral currents .",
    "detailed measurements of the nuclear dependence of individual quark structure functions are thus needed to establish the distinctive phenomenology of shadowing and antishadowing and to make the nutev results definitive .",
    "schmidt , yang , and i have also identified contributions to the nuclear multi - step reactions which arise from odderon exchange and hidden color degrees of freedom in the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "there are other ways in which this new view of antishadowing can be tested ; antishadowing can also depend on the target and beam polarization .",

    "<S> i discuss a number of novel topics in qcd , including the use of the ads / cft correspondence between anti - de sitter space and conformal gauge theories to obtain an analytically tractable approximation to qcd in the regime where the qcd coupling is large and constant . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there is an exact correspondence between the fifth - dimension coordinate @xmath0 of ads space and a specific impact variable @xmath1 which measures the separation of the quark constituents within the hadron in ordinary space - time . </S>",
    "<S> this connection allows one to compute the analytic form of the frame - independent light - front wavefunctions of mesons and baryons , the fundamental entities which encode hadron properties and allow the computation of exclusive scattering amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> i also discuss a number of novel phenomenological features of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> initial- and final - state interactions from gluon - exchange , normally neglected in the parton model , have a profound effect in qcd hard - scattering reactions , leading to leading - twist single - spin asymmetries , diffractive deep inelastic scattering , diffractive hard hadronic reactions , the breakdown of the lam tung relation in drell - yan reactions , and nuclear shadowing and non - universal antishadowing  leading - twist physics not incorporated in the light - front wavefunctions of the target computed in isolation . </S>",
    "<S> i also discuss tests of hidden color in nuclear wavefunctions , the use of diffraction to materialize the fock states of a hadronic projectile and test qcd color transparency , and anomalous heavy quark effects . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of direct higher - twist processes where a proton is produced in the hard subprocess can explain the large proton - to - pion ratio seen in high centrality heavy ion collisions . </S>"
