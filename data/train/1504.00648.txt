    "we consider optimization problems of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is locally lipschitz , but possibly nonsmooth and nonconvex , and where @xmath4 is a simply structured closed convex constraint set .",
    "we develop a bundle trust - region algorithm for ( [ program ] ) , which uses nonconvex cutting planes in tandem with a suitable trust - region management to assure global convergence .",
    "the trust - region management is to be considered as an alternative to proximity control , which is the usual policy in bundle methods .",
    "trust - regions allow a tighter control on the step - size , and give a larger choice of norms , whereas bundling is fused on the use of the euclidean norm .",
    "our experimental part demonstrates how these features may be exploited algorithmically .",
    "algorithms where bundle and trust - region elements are combined are rather sparse in the literature . for convex objectives",
    "ruszcyski @xcite presents a bundle trust - region method , which can be extended to composite convex functions . an early contribution where bundling and trust - regions are combined",
    "is @xcite , and this is also used in versions of the bt - code @xcite .",
    "@xcite use dc - functions to form a non - standard trust - region , which they also use in tandem with cutting planes . a feature",
    "which these methods share with nonconvex bundle methods like sagastizbel and hare @xcite or @xcite is that the objective is approximated by a simply structured , often polyhedral , working model , which is updated iteratively by adding cutting planes at unsuccessful trial steps .",
    "our main theorem [ theorem1 ] analyses the interaction of this mechanism with the trust - region management , and assures global convergence under realistic hypotheses .",
    "the trust - region strategy is well - understood in smooth optimization , where global convergence is proved by exploiting properties of the cauchy point , as pioneered in powell @xcite . for the present work it is therefore of the essence to realize that the cauchy point fails in the nonsmooth setting .",
    "this happens even for polyhedral convex functions , the simplest possible case , as we demonstrate by way of a counterexample .",
    "this explains why the convergence proof has to be organized along different lines .",
    "the question is then whether there are more restrictive classes of nonsmooth functions , where the cauchy point can be salvaged . in response",
    "we show that the classical trust - region strategy with cauchy point is still valid for upper @xmath5-functions , and at least partially , for functions having a strict standard model .",
    "it turns out that several problems in control and in contact mechanics are in this class , which justifies the disquisition . nonetheless , the class of functions where the cauchy point works remains exceptional in the nonsmooth framework , which is corroborated by the fact that it does not include nonsmooth convex functions .",
    "a strong incentive for the present work comes indeed from applications in automatic control .",
    "in the experimental part we will apply our novel bundle trust - region method to compute locally optimal solutions to three np - hard problems in the theory of systems with uncertain parameters .",
    "this includes ( i ) computing the worst - case @xmath1-norm of a system over a given uncertain parameter range , ( ii ) checking robust stability of an uncertain system over a given parameter range , and ( iii ) computing the distance to instability of a nominally stable system with uncertain parameters . in these applications",
    "the versatility of the bundle trust - region approach with regard to the choice of the norm is exploited .",
    "nonsmooth trust - region methods which do _ not _ include the possibility of bundling are more common , see for instance dennis _",

    "11 ) , where that idea is further expanded .",

    "the algorithm is developed in section [ sect_algo ] , and its global convergence is proved in section [ sect_convergence ] .",
    "applications of the model approach are discussed in section [ sect_applications ] , where we also discuss failure of the cauchy point .",

    "the third case is when @xmath585 . here",
    "the step is rejected , and the trust - region radius is halved , until a value @xmath586 is reached .    since @xmath26 is used , no cutting planes are taken , and we follow the classical trust - region method . in consequence ,",

    "convergence to a single critical point then follows by observing that @xmath631 satisfies a ojasiewicz inequality .      in our second problem",

    "as soon as @xmath640 , the solution @xmath633 of ( [ alpha ] ) represents a destabilizing choice of the parameters , and this may be valuable information in practice , see @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the global maximum has value @xmath641 , then a certificate for robust stability over @xmath642 is obtained .",
    "global maximization of ( [ alpha ] ) is known to be np - hard @xcite , so it is interesting to use a local optimization method to compute good lower bounds .",
    "this can be achieved by algorithm [ algo1 ] , because ( [ alpha ] ) is clearly of the form ( [ program ] ) if maximization of @xmath643 is replaced by minimization of @xmath644 over @xmath612 . in our experiment",

    "the method converges fast and reliably to a local optimum , which in the majority of cases can be certified _ a posteriori _ as a global one .    in order to justify the use of the standard model in algorithm [ algo1 ]",
    "we have to show that @xmath647 is upper-@xmath5 , or at least that its standard model is strict .",

    "this may lead to difficulties when @xmath651 is minimized .",
    "in contrast , in our numerical testing it is @xmath652 which is minimized , and this behaves consistently like an upper-@xmath5 function .",
    "theoretically we expect @xmath647 to have a strict standard model if all active eigenvalues of @xmath653 are semi - simple . an argument indicating that its standard model is at least directionally strict is given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "suppose every accumulation point @xmath633 of the sequence @xmath632 is simple .",
    "then the sequence @xmath656 converges to a critical point of ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "we apply theorem [ theorem1 ] to get convergence in the sense of subsequences .",
    "our third problem is related to the above and concerns computation of the structured distance to instability of ( [ plant ] ) .",

    "equivalently , we may consider the following constrained optimization program @xmath660 with decision variable @xmath661 .",
    "introducing the convex set @xmath662 , this can be transformed to program ( [ program ] ) if we minimize an exact penalty objective @xmath663 with a penalty constant @xmath386 over @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that the objective of @xmath6 has essentially the same properties as @xmath647 .",

    "indeed , the inclusion @xmath666 holds in general . for the reverse inclusion it suffices to observe that @xmath667 for those @xmath648 where @xmath665",
    "this is clear , because @xmath668 is a minorant of this max function .",

    "then @xmath672 is a strict model of @xmath6 at those @xmath12 where @xmath673 .",
    "in fact , the only axiom which does not follow immediately is @xmath83 .",
    "we only know @xmath674 , so @xmath675 .",
    "for those @xmath12 where the maximum rule is exact , this implies indeed @xmath676 .",
    "this means that we can use the model @xmath677 in algorithm [ algo1 ] to solve ( [ dist2 ] ) , naturally with the same proviso as in section [ sec - alpha ] , where we need the standard model @xmath26 of @xmath647 to be strict .",
