    "the study of nonclassical ( quantum ) correlation can be traced back to the 1930s , when schrdinger @xcite invented the word _",
    "entanglement _ to describe the inseparability of our knowledge of a composite system , and einstein @xcite used this peculiar correlation to argue that quantum mechanics is not complete .",
    "a formal mathematical definition of entanglement arises from the point of view that entanglement can not be created locally even with classical communication , therefore entangled states are those that can not be written as a convex sum of product states .",
    "this essentially motivated the definition of entanglement of formation @xmath0 and entanglement cost @xmath1 , the latter as the asymptotic version of the former .",
    "various other measures , such as entanglement of distillation @xmath2 @xcite , relative entropy of entanglement @xcite , squashed entanglement @xcite , arise to describe different properties of entangled states .    however ,",
    "entanglement ( in the strict sense , nonzero entanglement of formation ) is not the only aspect of quantum ( nonclassical ) correlation .",
    "quantum discord @xmath3 , formulated by ollivier and zurek @xcite , describes a different aspect of nonclassical correlation .",
    "other measures of nonclassical correlation beyond entanglement include the quantum deficit @xcite , measurement - induced disturbance @xcite , symmetric discord @xcite , relative entropy of discord and dissonance @xcite , geometric discord @xcite , and continuous - variable discord @xcite .",
    "for a nice review of the different measures of quantum correlation beyond entanglement , see @xcite .",
    "separable states could in general , have nonzero quantum correlation ; and the only states that have zero quantum discord are those classical - quantum ( cq ) states and the only states that have zero symmetric discord are those classical - classical ( cc ) states . both quantum discord and symmetric discord have been studied in dqc1 model of quantum computation @xcite , and it is widely believed that the speedup in quantum computation could be attributed to the existence of nonclassical correlation beyond entanglement @xcite .    despite the enormous works on quantifying classical and quantum correlations , there are many essential issues that need to be solved or understood , such as the differences in various measures of classical and quantum correlations , the irreversibility in entanglement manipulation , and the additivity problem of entanglement of formation .",
    "the purpose of this article is to establish quantitative relations among several entropic measures of classical and nonclassical correlations , especially those related to quantum discord and the symmetric discord , and provide insights into the irreversibility of entanglement manipulation and additivity of various measures . in this article ,",
    "the measures of classical and nonclassical correlations are defined according to optimizations over positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) measurements , while most discussions in the literature are based on projective measurements .",
    "the article is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we start with an introduction to several naturally defined measures of classical and nonclassical correlations . in section iii , we establish inequality relations for several different measures of classical and nonclassical correlations .",
    "we use these relations to investigate some open questions in the following two sections . in section iv",
    ", we obtain an upper bound of entanglement irreversibility and a sufficient condition for reversible entanglement . in section",

    "the symmetric discord is given by the difference of quantum mutual information and @xmath30 : @xmath32 since @xmath9 can be viewed as the holevo bound of ensemble @xmath15 prepared for bob by alice s measurement on her system a , it is an upper bound of the accessible information @xmath30 via a subsequent measurement by bob on his system b @xcite , i.e. , @xmath33 similarly , @xmath34 therefore , we have @xmath35 for a review of entropic measures of nonclassical correlation , see @xcite .    if classical communication is also allowed in addition to the local measurements , other alternative measures of classical correlation are possible .",

    "therefore , the regularized quantum discord @xmath142 is just an upper bound for entanglement irreversibility of @xmath4 .",

    "their regularized versions are additive by definition , but there is no indication that the regularized versions are fully additive .    , the additivity of entanglement of formation in @xmath152 is equivalent to the additivity of quantum discord in another bipartite state @xmath153 ( or @xmath154 ) when the measurement is performed on the third system @xmath155.,width=226 ]    there is an equivalence for the additivity of the three quantities : entanglement of formation @xmath0 , the measure of classical correlation @xmath67 , and quantum discord @xmath3 . for any tripartite pure state @xmath103 , from ( [ efcrelationpure ] ) , ( [ efcrelationregularized ] ) and the definition of quantum discord , we have @xmath156 from these relations we know that the nonadditivity of entanglement of formation for a bipartite state @xmath4 is equivalent to the nonadditivity of quantum discord @xmath3 ( or the classical correlation @xmath67 ) in either @xmath105 or @xmath113 as long as they share the same purification @xmath103 and the measurement is performed on the third system c ( see fig .",
