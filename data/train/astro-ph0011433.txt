    "high resolution observations taken by , e.g. , yohkoh and soho during the solar minimum years have revealed small scale transient phenomena occurring everywhere on the solar surface .",
    "their presence could have important consequences on the issue of coronal heating : depending on their energy content and distribution , and rate of occurrence , they could provide enough energy to heat the corona ( see reviews in ) .",
    "moreover , if these transient events represent the low energy tail of the broader solar flare family , their study could more easily identify the `` basic '' flare mechanisms , not biased by global collective effects as in the case of major solar flares .",
    "impulsive variations of the emission in the corona or transition region , that could be defined as low - energy flares , have long been observed in both `` quiet sun '' regions , within magnetic network structures ( , ) , and active regions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the characteristics of the brightenings associated to the magnetic network .    observed some small scale , transient soft x - ray brightening events associated to network magnetic bipoles .",
    "these events are spatially and temporally associated with microwave emission , and show several similarities with more energetic flares , such as the same ratio between the total energy emitted in soft - x and radio frequencies , etc .   however , the total observed radiative losses for these events are more than one order of magnitude smaller than previously reported x - ray events . for these brightenings they introduced the term _ soft x - ray network flares_.    recent soho results , based on mdi , eit , sumer and cds observations ,",
    "have further demonstrated the highly dynamic nature of the `` quiet magnetic network '' .",
    "many observations confirm the existence of euv brightening events in small - size structures . and observed rapid variations in the emission of transition region lines , associated with junctions of the network magnetic field .",
    "the emission characteristics of these brightenings , called blinkers , suggest that they are a class of phenomena distinct from the network flares .",
    "spectrographic observations have shown bursts of highly doppler - shifted emission , called transition region explosive events ( among others , ; ; ) . explored the relationships between blinkers and explosive events .",
    "they concluded that although the two phenomena appear different because of the differences in size and duration , they seem to be closely related to each other , for explosive events occur at the edges of blinkers and at the same time . magnetic reconnection in different magnetic geometries is invoked to explain the observed differences . and searched for euv and radio emission variations in non active regions associated to the magnetic network .",
    "they observed faint coronal and transition region fluctuations sharing some general properties with more energetic flares ( such as the delay between emission originating at different atmospheric layers ) and interpreted them as micro- or nano - flares occurring onto the magnetic network .",
    "the investigations mentioned above refer predominantly to coronal and transition region spectral signatures and to photospheric magnetic field measurements . at chromospheric and photospheric levels",
    "the bright features associated to the magnetic network do show intensity variations in many spectral signatures (; ) .",
    "however , the interpretation for these fluctuations is still an open problem : they might be the result of magneto - acoustic waves which propagate upward along the magnetic lines of force ( ) or they could represent an instability of the chromosphere itself , as a response to micro or nano - flares processes ( ) .",
    "these fluctuations are usually studied in a _",
    "statistical _ sense and have never been put into direct relation with the network flares identified at higher atmospheric layers .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss the search performed at chromospheric and photospheric levels for flares occurring on the magnetic network . beside the customary analysis of the intensity and velocity variations",
    ", we also investigate the changes of the magnetic flux density , and their relation with the fluctuations of the velocity field .",
    "we use a subset of the high spatial resolution observations obtained in august 1996 during a coordinated observing program between ground based observatory ( `` r.b .",
    "dunn '' solar telescope at nso / sacramento peak ) and the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",

    "monochromatic intensity images were obtained with the tunable universal birefringent filter ( ubf ) and the zeiss filter , at high spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "spectra have been acquired with the horizontal spectrograph ( hsg ) around the caii k and h@xmath1 lines , setting the slit in different positions within the field of view ( fov ) .",

    "the mdi data were considered for a longer interval , 14 - 17 ut . a small active region ( ar noaa 7984 ) , with a very low activity level , was present in the field of view . some pores and a small spot were the prominent structures in the white light and continuum images , and have been used for co - alignement of the whole dataset . at",
    "each given time the alignment among the images acquired with different instruments was better than about @xmath5 .",
    "we refer to for details on fov overlay and data reduction procedures .",
    "the magnetic network structure was clearly visible within the fov in several sets of images ( mdi magnetic maps ; nad@xmath6   intensity ; h@xmath7  wings ) .",
    "we searched for activity manifestations on several network bright points ( nbp ) , sharing the following properties : - bright in the ca ii wings and in the ca ii k@xmath6 peaks ; - visible in the nad@xmath6   images for about 1 hr ; - spatially coincident with magnetic structures .",
    "we identified a total of 11 nbps with the required characteristics , displayed in figure  [ fig_fov ] .",
    "we did not consider other bright points visible in the fov , since no corresponding caii k spectra were available .",
    "image of the fov , averaged over the period 15:15 - 16:05 ut , aug . 15 1996 .",
    "the bright pattern closely overlays the network magnetic structure ( cauzzi _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "the black squares indicate the 11 nbps analyzed .",
    "the arrow indicates the peculiar nbp considered in the following . ]",
    "as a first step , we searched for the presence of flaring episodes within the network by analysing the intensity light curves , obtained separately for each nbps and each spectral signature .",
    "light curves were obtained setting an intensity threshold for each signature , and averaging over the spatial pixels that exceeded this threshold ( more details can be found in ) .",
    "for the white light , nii continuum and hei- d@xmath8 images no intensity threshold could clearly discriminate between nbps and surrounding areas , within the limits of our statistical photometric precision ( @xmath9 0.5% ) .    in figure",
    "[ light_curves ] , as an example , we show light curves of different signatures for two network bright points .",
    "the variations of the emission are small in amplitude and semi - regular in their temporal distribution .",
    "none of the analysed nbps displays any sudden intensity enhancement that could suggest the presence of a transient phenomenon such as a micro - flare . a search for the presence of regular fluctuations has been performed in and reveals different temporal frequencies for different spectral signatures .",
    "@xmath10    emission . left column : `` typical '' nbp with simultaneous intensity variations in the h@xmath7  wings ; right column : the only nbp showing non - correlated variations in the h@xmath7  wings ( indicated by arrows ) . ]    the fluctuations in different spectral signatures are not clearly in phase with each other ( see figure [ light_curves ] ) .",
    "an exception is represented by the h@xmath11    wings light curves ( figure [ light_curves ] , left ) .",
    "the evolution of most nbps in the red and blue wings of h@xmath7 is very similar , with simultaneous intensity variations of the same amplitude , between 0.5 and 1.5% of their average values .",
    "this similarity indicates that velocity fluctuations do not play a role in the observed intensity variations , and that these are most likely related to temperature or density fluctuations .",
    "however , one of the analysed nbps displays out - of - phase intensity variations in the wings of h@xmath7 , that could be explained by an asymmetric absorption profile ( see figure [ light_curves ] , right ) .",
    "the hypothesis of an h@xmath7   absorption profile seems reasonable , since the light curves obtained in the h@xmath7   center do not show any particular enhancement at any time and the h@xmath1   spectra acquired on several nbps at different times always show an absorption profile .    interpreting the difference in intensity as due to a velocity field ( as commonly done in dopplergrams ) , we derived the line - of - sight velocity corresponding to the layers that contribute to the h@xmath7 wings .",
    "wings velocity , with the error bar indicated by the dashed line .",
    "thick line : mdi - nii velocity , @xmath12 km / s . ]    in figure [ ha_vel ] we show this velocity as a function of time for this particular nbp ( top panel ) and for one `` typical '' nbp ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the peculiar nbp displays three spikes of downward velocity within the interval 15:25 ",
    "15:45 ut , with a typical lifetime of about 1.5 minutes .",
    "the amplitude of these spikes is well above the error estimated at about 1 km / s .",
    "a downward motion measured in h@xmath7 or other chromospheric lines represents a typical signature during the impulsive phase of a flare ( ) .",
    "this motion is due to the sudden compression of the lower atmosphere caused by either a particle beam or a conduction front .",
    "this has been proved also for small size events , such as the microflares described by as the h@xmath7 counterparts of hard x - rays burst .",
    "hence , we can suppose that these downward velocity episodes represent the signature of the occurrence of flare processes within this peculiar nbp .",
    "the mdi velocity fluctuations measured in this area ( figure [ ha_vel ] , thicker line ) are comparable with those registered in any other nbp and , in particular , do not show any peak in correspondence with the downward motions registered in the h@xmath7  wings .",
    "probably , within the flare driven chromospheric condensation , the h@xmath7  wings originate from higher atmospheric levels than the nii line used by mdi , and are more sensitive to the disturbances introduced by a flare .",
    "this nbp coincides on the mdi maps with a magnetic structure of negative polarity with a flux density smoothly increasing in time from 150 to 250 g. some very weak structures of opposite polarity , barely above the noise ( 15 g ) , are present in the surroundings .    in general , within the nbp areas both the magnetic flux density ( b ) and the line of sight velocity ( v )",
    "fluctuate with a rough periodicity of 5 minutes , but these fluctuations do not appear to be related to each other ( see for further details ) . for this particular nbp ,",
    "the b and v fluctuations are instead well correlated for long periods of time , 14:00 - 15:10 ut and 15:40 - 17:00 ut ( see figure [ vel_b ] ) .",
    "however , during the interval 15:10 - 15:40 , when also the h@xmath7  downward motions are measured ( see figure [ vel_b ] ) , their correlation gets smaller .",
    "these characteristics are confirmed by a more accurate analysis , that makes use of the phase difference ( @xmath13 ) and the coherence ( @xmath14 ) spectra in the fourier domain for the pair b - v ( see for definition of @xmath13 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "basically , the phase difference provides a measure of the delays between periodic signals , while the coherence gives the persistence of this phase difference .",
    "reliable values of phase difference can be given only if c has values higher than about 0.9 .    in figure [ phas_cohe ] ( left )",
    "we show the phase difference b - v for the peculiar nbp , as a function of the temporal frequency , computed for the whole observing period and for three separated periods of one hour each . for this calculation we considered positive the upward velocity ,",
    "as it is customary .",
    "the corresponding coherence spectra are shown in figure [ phas_cohe ] ( right ) .",
    "the coherence spectrum shows a peak of about 0.95 at the frequency corresponding to 5 minutes oscillations in the time intervals 14 - 15 ut and 16 - 17 ut .",
    "this maximum is lowered to about 0.7 - 0.8 during the period 15 - 16 ut , when b and v lose their correlation ( figure [ vel_b ] ) . at the frequency of the maximum coherence the phase difference is of about @xmath16 , with the upward velocity v leading b.",
    "this is consistent with the presence of propagating magnetoacoustic waves within this magnetic area ( ) , possibily excited by granular buffeting of the magnetic elements ( ) .",
    "for all the other nbps the b - v coherence spectra assume very low values ( figure [ phas_cohe ] , dashed ) , and hence no phase difference analysis can be performed .",
    "the lack of coherence between b and v fluctuations in the majority of nbps could be explained by the magnetic field configuration in the network .",
    "as shown for example by , the network magnetic cells consist of a large number of very small concentrations of mixed polarities , connected mostly via short loops . in such small structures , wave reflections or distortion",
    "can destroy the coherence between b and v fluctuations , not allowing the persistence of any phase difference .",
    "the particular nbp where we observe a definite phase difference , might instead be connected to the opposite polarity via a longer loop that hence allows wave propagation .    as said above , in this nbp",
    "the coherence between b and v is reduced during the interval 15:10 - 15:40 ut ( figure [ vel_b ] ) .",
    "the temporal coincidence with the h@xmath7  downward motions suggests that the same phenomenon can be responsible also for this disturbance .",
    "if the downward motions measured in h@xmath7   are a signature of a flare , one can suppose the occurrence of magnetic reconnection processes involving this longer loop and having strong effects on the footpoint(s ) . during a reconnection process , the magnetic topology changes abruptly and any oscillations regime of b would be strongly perturbed . as a result",
    ", the wave propagation will be disrupted and the b - v coherence reduced .",
    "the phase difference between the fluctuations could then be re - established once the perturbation is over .",
    "the mdi maps show some weak magnetic structures of opposite polarity in the vicinity of this nbp within the considered temporal interval .",
    "any of these structures could be involved in the reconnection process , but the complexity of the `` salt and pepper '' magnetic pattern makes it impossible to identify the particular feature involved .",
    "the scenario outlined in the previous sections of a magnetic reconnection and a sudden compression at low atmospheric layers suggests the possibility of associated emission coming from higher atmospheric layers . hence , we searched for coronal signatures",
    "temporally and/or spatially associated with these signals from the lower atmosphere .",
    "unfortunately , during the considered time lag yohkoh was in its night - time and only sxt full - disk frames were available before and after this interval .",
    "two active regions were present on the disk : noaa 7982 at the west limb and noaa 7984 , visible in our fov .",
    "an accurate analysis of the images available for both regions , for two hours before and one hour after , reveals that the sxr emission of noaa 7982 was decreasing very slowly during the whole period , while noaa 7984 showed global intensity fluctuations of about @xmath17 2%/hour .",
    "this suggests that only the region present in our fov can show some episodes of activity .",
    "goes recorded an a6 burst in both channels ( 0.5 - 4 and 1 - 8  ) , with maximum peak at 15:43 ut . the temporal evolution of the sxr emission in the 1 - 8    band is shown in figure [ soft_vel ] , superimposed to the line - of - sight velocity outbursts deduced from the h@xmath7  wings .",
    "the temporal coincidence between the two curves is good .",
    "the first two velocity spikes , of small amplitude , correspond to a modest increase of the sxr emission ( build - up phase ) , while the third , larger one , corresponds to the peak of the goes curve .",
    "if we accept the suggestion that only the ar present in our fov can display activity , this particular nbp most probably is the footpoint of a flaring loop .",
    "line - of - sight velocity . ]    following , from the ratio of the goes channels power fluxes ( 0.5@xmath184 / 1@xmath188  ) , we can estimate an electron temperature t@xmath19 of about 4.5   mk and an emission measure of about @xmath20 @xmath21 . assuming a mean electron density of @xmath22 @xmath21 , ( typical of dense coronal loops ) we can estimate a mean volume of @xmath23 @xmath24 for the plasma emitting the measured sxr burst . a cylindrical coronal loop , with a constant diameter of 5@xmath4 ( somewhat larger than this nbp to take into account the possible size increase of magnetic structures at coronal levels ) ,",
    "would have a total length of @xmath25 km , with a total thermal energy content of about @xmath0 erg .",
    "hence , in a completely independent way , we again suggest the presence of a long magnetic loop with a footpoint in a network bright area .",
    "the values found for t@xmath19 , for the em and for the associated thermal energy for this sxr event are consistent with those quoted by for microflares of a6 goes type .",
    "we can then conclude that this event can be considered as a real _ network microflare_.",
    "we searched for the presence of chromospheric and photospheric signatures of low - energy flares occurring on the magnetic network .",
    "eleven nbps , each one corresponding to a patch of definite polarity , were selected in a 2@xmath26 field of view , where also a small and low - activity region was present .",
    "the intensity fluctuations of several spectral signatures observed for the nbps do not show any impulsive episodes typical of the flare occurrence .",
    "the general characteristics found for these nbps do not differ from the ones derived in quiet regions ( ) . only for one nbp we found two peculiar characteristics :    * the intensity fluctuations in the h@xmath7  wings ( @xmath17 1.5   ) are not in phase for about 20 minutes . from the difference of the intensity of the h@xmath7  wings we derived the corresponding velocity and found that three spikes of downward motions ( respectively of 2.0 , 2.7 and 3.7 @xmath17 1.0 km / s ) occurred within this interval .",
    "plasma motions of this kind are generally considered as a signature of sudden compression of the lower atmosphere , typical of flares .",
    "* in the fourier domain , at the frequency corresponding to 5 minutes oscillations , the mdi magnetic and velocity fluctuations in this nbp show a coherence spectrum with a high value ( @xmath27 , see figure [ phas_cohe ] ) when compared to the average for all the other nbps ( @xmath28 ) . analyzing the coherence spectrum for 3 separate periods",
    ", we found that before and after the downward velocity episodes , the coherence has an even higher value of about 0.95 , while just during the sudden compression episodes , the coherence is lowered to 0.7 .",
    "we suggest that a reconnection process , that might be responsible for the sudden compression indicated by the three spikes of downward velocity , might also destroy the coherence of magneto - acoustic waves propagating along the magnetic field lines of a long loop connecting this nbp with a far opposite polarity .",
    "goes recorded an a6 burst in both channels , that temporally coincides with the stronger downward velocity spike .",
    "we derived @xmath29   mk and em @xmath30 @xmath21 for a coronal loop with a constant diameter of 5@xmath4 and a total length of about @xmath25 km .",
    "the general picture emerging from the data is hence the following : the particular network bright point in exam is connected via a long magnetic loop to a far opposite polarity structure . in `` quiet '' conditions , magneto - acoustic waves can propagate along this loop as derived from the @xmath16 phase difference measured between b and v fluctuations . magnetic reconnection involving this loop",
    "disrupts the coherence between these fluctuations , and produces the compression episodes observed in the lower atmosphere . at coronal levels",
    "the simultaneous increase in sxr emission might identify the corresponding chromospheric evaporation .",
    "all this evidence points toward the occurrence of a real `` network flare '' .",
    "contrary to more energetic flares , for such an event a sudden intensity increase does not represent a characteristic signature in the low atmosphere .",
    "instead , downward motions seem to be a common property for both larger and smaller flares .",
    "an intriguing characteristic of this particular flare is given by the disruption of the coherence between the b and v fluctuations .",
    "this is the first time that such a property is observed , so it would be premature to comment on its relevance as a flare signature .",
    "further investigation on the subject is desirable .",
    "the authors express their warmest thanks to the mdi team ( p.i .",
    "scherrer ) for the efficient support during the observing run . the support of the nso / sacramento peak `` r.b .",
