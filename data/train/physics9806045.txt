    "in 1868 helmholtz @xcite introduces the notion of a flow consisting of a potential and stagnant zones matching at priori unknown free boundaries which are tangential discontinuities and where the balance of normal stresses ( the pressure ) holds .",
    "kirchhoff @xcite came up with the first solution for the ideal flow around flat plate when the detachment points were known in advance .",
    "later on in the turning of our century , levi - civita @xcite , villat @xcite etc . developed further the hodograph method and demonstrated its application to flows around curved bodies . satisfying an additional condition for smooth separation ( called now brillouin - villat condition @xcite ) brodetsky @xcite obtained by the hodograph method approximate solution for the circular cylinder with a parabolic expanding at infinity shape of the stagnation zone .    in the years 40 of the present century with the computer advent it was already possible to calculate such class of flows direct at the physical plane .",
    "the first calculations @xcite gave interesting results .",
    "along with the brodetsky flow a radically different helmholtz flow takes place with decreasing stagnation zone which forms at infinity cusp @xcite . because of the limitation of computers the shape of the zone was not conclusive .",
    "it appears that the method of hodograph can also be applied to obtain such a flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) but only for the case of circular cylinder .",
    "we also found such cusp - ended stagnation zones @xcite by means of difference scheme and confirmed by integral - method calculations @xcite .",
    "a new interesting solution for the shape of the wake behind the circular cylinder was obtained after further modifying of the difference scheme .",
    "preliminary results of this study are represented in @xcite .",
    "the features of the algorithm and our further investigation will be discussed here .",
    "consider the steady inviscid flow past a circle  the cross section of an infinitely long circular cylinder .",
    "the direction of the flow coincides with the line @xmath1 of the polar coordinates and the leading stagnation point of the flow is situated in the point @xmath2 . taking into account the symmetry with respect to the line @xmath3 we consider the flow only in upper half plane .",
    "the gist of our approach is to make use of two different coordinate systems : the polar one ( turning out to be ineffective for the case of infinite stagnation zones extending far away from the rear end of body ) and the parabolic one the latter being topologically more suited for solving laplace equation outside infinitely long stagnation zones .",
    "we initiate the calculations in polar coordinates switching to parabolic coordinates after the stagnation zone has fairly well developed and has become long enough .    in terms of the two coordinate systems (",
    "cylindrical and parabolic ) laplace equation for the stream function @xmath4 reads : @xmath5    the undisturbed uniform flow at infinity is given by @xmath6    on the combined surface `` body+stagnation zone '' hold two conditions .",

    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the magnitudes of the independent coordinates for which the detachment of flow occurs . as far as we consider only the case when the stagnation zone is situated behind the body then the portion of @xmath14 which describes the free line of the flow is defined as @xmath15 or @xmath16 respectively . on @xmath14",
    "the shape function @xmath17 is unknown and it is to be implicitly identified from bernoulli integral with the pressure equal to a constant ( say , @xmath18 ) which is the second condition holding on the free boundary .",

    "the above stated boundary value problem is very inconvenient for numerical treatment mainly because of two reasons .",
    "the first is that the boundary lines are not coordinate lines .",
    "the second is that the shape function of the stagnation zone must be implicitly identified from the additional boundary condition ( [ eq : dyncond ] ) .",
    "following @xcite we scale the independent variable ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 by the shape function @xmath8 or @xmath24 : @xmath25 such a manipulation renders the original physical domain under consideration into a region with fixed boundaries , the latter being coordinate lines .",
    "in addition the bernoulli integral becomes an explicit equation for the shape function of the free boundary . scaling the independent variable proved very efficient in numerical treatment of inviscid or viscous flows with free boundaries ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we treat the two coordinate systems in an uniform way denoting @xmath26 or @xmath27 depending on the particular case under consideration . in terms of the new",
    "coordinates @xmath28 , the stream function is a compound function @xmath29 or @xmath30 but in what follows we drop the `` tilde '' without fear of confusion .",

    "the first and the last @xmath41-lines are displaced ( staggered ) from the respective domain boundaries on a half of the adjacent value of the spacing . thus on two - point stencils second - order approximation for the boundary conditions is achieved ( see @xcite .",
    "the non - uniformity of the mesh enables us to improve the accuracy near the body and to reduce the number of points at infinity .    in @xmath22-direction",
    "the mesh is not staggered but it is once again non - uniform being very dense in the vicinity of the rear stagnation point , i.e. in the vicinity of @xmath47 which is of crucial importance when acknowledging the infinity in cylindrical coordinates .",

    "we solve the boundary value problem iteratively by means of the method of splitting of operator . upon introducing fictitious time",
    "we render the equation to parabolic type and then employ the so - called scheme of stabilising correction @xcite . on the first half - time step we have the following differential equations (",
    "@xmath54 is the time increment ) @xmath55 for @xmath56 with respective boundary conditions @xcite    the second half - time step consists in solving the following differential equations @xmath57    for @xmath58 with respective boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "thus the b.v.p . for the stream function",
    "is reduced to consequative systems with sparse ( tridiagonal ) matrices ( for detail see e.g.,@xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the economical schemes of the splitting type is that on each half - time step we solve one - dimensional problems with sparse ( tridiagonal ) matrices .",
    "this can be done by means of the thomas algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , the system for streamfunction @xmath59 can not be solved by plane thomas algorithm since the condition for numerical stability of the elimination is not satisfied for all points of domain .",
    "for this reason a modification of the thomas algorithm ( in fact gaussian elimination with pivoting for three - diagonal systems ) called `` non - monotonous progonka '' ( see @xcite , @xcite ) is employed for its solution .",

    "thus the mere condition for existence of the square root of the bernoulli integral defines at each iteration stage @xmath83 the new approximation for the position of the detachment point so that it slides during the iterations alongside the rigid body .",
    "this manner of determining of the detachment point we called christov s algorithm ( see @xcite ) .    in the end",
    "a relaxation is used for the shape - function of the free boundary at each global iteration according to the formula : @xmath84    where @xmath85 is called relaxation parameter .",
    "each global iteration contains two stages . on the first stage ,",
    "the difference problem for laplace equation is solved iteratively either in polar or in parabolic coordinates ( depending on the development of the stagnation zone ) . the internal iterations ( time steps with respect to the fictitious time in the splitting procedure ) are conducted until convergence is achieved in the sense that the uniform norm is lesser than @xmath86 .",
    "thus the new iteration for stream function @xmath87 is obtained .",
    "the polar coordinates appear to be instrumental only on the first several ( 7 - 10 ) global iterations .",
    "when the rearmost cusp point of the stagnation zone reaches 3050 diameters of cylinder ( calibers ) , the current - iteration values of the sought functions are transformed to parabolic coordinates and hence the calculations for the stream function continue solely in terms of parabolic coordinates .",
    "the second stage of a global iteration consists in solving the difference problem for the free surface in polar coordinates .",
    "the transition to and from parabolic coordinates is done according to ( [ eq : polar_to_prb ] ) and ( [ eq : contt ] ) .",
    "note that there is one - to - one correspondence between the points in polar and parabolic coordinates and hence between the respective values of the scalar set functions @xmath4 and @xmath82 .",
    "the criterion for convergence of the global iterations is defined by the convergence of the shape function as being the most sensitive part of the algorithm , namely the global iterations are terminated when @xmath88    the obtained solutions for the stream function and the shape function of the boundary are the values of the last iteration @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . then the velocity , pressure , and the forces exerted from the flow upon the body are calculated .",
    "the numerical correctness of scheme ( [ eq : frst_step ] ) , ( [ eq : sec_step ] ) is verified through exhaustive numerical experiments and through comparison with the known exact solution for the inviscid non - separated flow past a circular cylinder @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the stream function , @xmath93  the velocity of the main flow and @xmath94 and @xmath95 - the polar coordinates of a point of the flow .",
    "we used different meshes with sizes @xmath96 : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , etc . respectively , the actual infinity @xmath102 assumed in the numerical experiments the values 5 , 10 , 20 .",
    "the dependence of the numerical solution on the time increment @xmath54 is also investigated and it is shown that the approximation of the stationary part of the equations ( [ eq : frst_step ] ) and ( [ eq : sec_step ] ) does not depend on @xmath54 , i.e. the scheme has the property called by yanenko @xcite _ full approximation_. the relative differences for @xmath92 when @xmath54 is in the interval [ 0.001,2 ] do not exceed 0.5% .",
    "the numerical experiments show that the optimal values for @xmath54 is in interval [ 0.5,1 ] . for this reason the rest of the calculations in the present work are performed with @xmath103 .",
    "the comparison of the solution ( [ eq : an_sol ] ) to the present numerical results is quantitatively very good .",
    "the deviations for the different meshes are in order of approximation @xmath104 and do not exceed 3% .",
    "for example in case of mesh @xmath105 the relative error is about 0.9% .    the adequate choice of the `` actual infinities '' @xmath106 and the spacings @xmath107 have a profound impact on the accuracy of the difference schemes ( [ eq : frst_step ] ) and ( [ eq : sec_step ] ) . for a given `` actual infinity ''",
    "the improvement in the accuracy can be achieved through increasing the number of mesh points ( decreasing the size of spacing ) .",
    "this makes the use of uniform mesh ineffective because in the far - field region the gradients of the flow are small and the high resolution is not necessary .",
    "that was the reason to employ the non - uniform meshes .",
    "the `` optimal '' value for the relaxation parameter turned out to be @xmath108 .",
    "smaller values increased intolerable the computational time while @xmath109 could not ensure the convergence of the global iterations . respectively",
    "@xmath110 is the optimal value for the lateral `` actual infinity ''    in order to compare calculated results with the prescription of the levi - civita method in case of so called critical separation angle @xmath111 ( in respect to leading stagnation point of the cylinder ) it is necessary to summarize that method and deduce corresponding relations .",

    "if the parameters have values @xmath122 , it corresponds to the so called critical separated flow , which detaches at angle @xmath117 .",
