    "the fascinating properties of plasmonics provide the foundation for various applications including integrated optical circuits  @xcite , single - molecule detection  @xcite , super - resolution imaging  @xcite , photovoltaic  @xcite , color generation  @xcite , and biological sensing  @xcite .",
    "these achievements were mostly realized in the visible or near - infrared regions where the noble metals are hosting plasmons that can be driven by light fields .    with the rapid rise of graphene",
    ", new scientific and technological opportunities are appearing  @xcite and in the context of optoelectronics and photonics , highly doped graphene is considered a promising plasmonic material working in the mid - infrared and terahertz ( thz ) spectral windows  @xcite . compared to plasmon polaritons in noble metals  @xcite , the graphene - plasmon polariton ( gpp ) exhibits even stronger mode confinement and relatively longer propagation distance , with an additional unique ability of being electrically or chemically tunable  @xcite .",
    "these extraordinary features of graphene plasmons have stimulated an intense line of investigations on both fundamental properties of graphene plasmons  @xcite as well as the prospective for applications in metamaterials  @xcite , modulators  @xcite , photodetectors  @xcite , and sensors  @xcite .",
    "naturally , plasmon properties depend on the charge - carrier density and high doping levels of graphene can be achieved either by electrostatic top - gating  @xcite or by chemical doping with surface treatment  @xcite . despite the progress in achieving yet higher doping levels ,",
    "it remains a challenge to push graphene plasmons to the near - infrared or even visible frequency regimes . in this paper , we review recent progress by emphasizing graphene plasmonics from fundamental light - matter interactions to some potential applications .",
    "the basic optical properties of non - radiating graphene - plasmon polaritons ( gpp ) in an extended graphene sheet are firstly reviewed , and then three main subjects of graphene plasmonics are discussed : ( 1 )  excitation of graphene - plasmon polaritons ; ( 2 )  plasmon - phonon interactions in graphene on polar substrates ; ( 3 )  tunable graphene plasmonics and its applications .",

    "one of the unique properties is that the electron energy follows a linear dispersion @xmath2 near the dirac point , with fermi energy @xmath3 where @xmath4 m/s is the fermi velocity and @xmath5 is the charge - carrier concentration .",
    "we note that for pristine graphene in a nearest - neighbor tight - binding description , the unit cell is occupied by two electrons which at low temperatures fully populate the low - energy band [ shown in blue color in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion](a ) ] , while the high - energy band ( shown in red ) remains empty .",
    "thus , undoped graphene ( @xmath6 ) behaves as a semimetal , sometimes also being referred to as a zero - bandgap semiconductor .",
    "the optical conductivity of pristine graphene @xmath7 is independent of any material parameters  @xcite , giving a constant value of 2.3@xmath8 for the optical absorption of a single - layer graphene from the visible to near - infrared spectral windows .",
    "this featureless absorption is a manifestation of the massless dirac fermions and quite remarkably the observed absorption number ties closely with the fine - structure constant @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 . while it is already fascinating that an atomically thin layer can absorb as much as 2.3% , it is at least equally attractive that optical properties of graphene can be substantially modified by changing the fermi energy with the further addition of charge carriers  @xcite .",
    "plasmons in graphene have many properties in common with longitudinal plasmon oscillations in two - dimensional electron gases supported by semiconductor heterostructures , but it is predicted that graphene also supports a transverse electric mode  @xcite , which does not appear in the more common two - dimensional electron gasses with parabolic energy dispersion . here ,",
    "we consider the transverse magnetic mode in an extended graphene sheet ( characterized by its conductivity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the wave vector of the gpp ) sandwiched between two dielectric surroundings , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] ( b ) .",

    "where @xmath16 , eq .  [ eq : disperion ] can be simplified as @xmath17 the optical conductivity @xmath18 can be treated by the nonlocal density - density response function  @xcite . for the local - response limit ,",

    "we have for the purpose of illustration considered typical numbers given by @xmath26  ev and @xmath27  mev .",
    "in order to exploit and manipulate gpps within various nanophotonic and optoelectronic applications , it is crucial to facilitate an efficient coupling of photons to gpps for the development of future devices . here ,",

    "graphene plasmons in nano-/micro - patterned graphene structures such as ribbons  @xcite and disks  @xcite , so - called localized gpps , can be easily excited .",
    "but the strong spatial confinement of gpps limits their applications when long propagation length is needed for e.g. communication and information processing techniques .",
