    "flux - flow instabilities are abrupt transitions from the flux - flow regime of type - ii superconductors to the normal state@xcite , observed in the current - voltage ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) characteristic at bias currents larger than the critical current @xmath2 and below the critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "these instabilities have been extensively studied in low - temperature superconductors ( ltscs)@xcite and in cuprate high - temperature superconductors ( htscs)@xcite . specifically , they can be used as a probe of quasiparticle energy - relaxation processes@xcite , which are related to the pairing mechanism and superconducting gap@xcite , as well as to investigate the interplay between vortex dynamics and pinning@xcite . moreover , as far as applications are concerned , their disruptive impact on the stability of the superconducting state is of primary importance to the realization and improvement of any superconducting device , e.g. , magnets , current - leads , or fault - current limiters .",
    "whereas in ltscs instabilities are generally driven by an intrinsic electronic mechanism@xcite , the superconducting quenching in htscs@xcite is more controversial in nature , due to the presence of non - negligible thermal effects@xcite , and observable only under very constrained experimental conditions , e.g. , within narrow ranges of applied magnetic field and temperature . besides , the recently discovered iron - based superconductors@xcite are very promising for technological applications , being major competitors of mgb@xmath4 and cuprates@xcite , due to their extraordinarily high upper critical fields@xcite , high current densities@xcite , and high isotropies@xcite . from a fundamental point of view , these materials are unconventional superconductors which exhibit a distinctive multiband structure of the superconducting gap , and whose pairing mechanism is still under debate@xcite . to date , there has been no experimental evidence of flux - flow instabilities in iron chalcogenides , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "very recently , a related phenomenon has been observed in a bakfeas mesoscopic structure , where the transition to the normal state due to non - magnetic impurities is ascribed to phase - slips@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we report the first experimental observation of the quenching of the superconducting state associated to the flux - flow instability in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics of fe(se , te ) thin films .",
    "although thermal effects have been minimized by a pulsed bias technique , their residual contributions have been taken into account by evaluating the temperature increase of the film due to joule self - heating .",
    "nevertheless , experimental data in external magnetic field reveal the intrinsic nature of the instability , which therefore coexists with a non - negligible contribution of extrinsic thermal effects .",

    "in type - ii superconductors , the quenching of the superconducting state occurs with a voltage jump in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic at the instability current @xmath5 , as a consequence either of an intrinsic mechanism related to the vortex dynamics@xcite or of extrinsic phenomena due to self - heating effects@xcite .",
    "the fingerprint of the intrinsic origin of the quenching is the presence of a distinctive shape of the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic in voltage - driven measurements . in this case",
    ", a negative differential resistance appears at the instability current @xmath6 and voltage @xmath7 , which subsequently merges the normal state branch @xmath8 , when the current reaches again the value @xmath9 . in current - driven measurements",
    "this feature is hidden by a sudden jump of the voltage at @xmath6 . within the larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo )",
    "model@xcite , flux - flow instabilities in @xmath0-@xmath1 curves at @xmath7 correspond to sudden drops in the viscosity of the abrikosov lattice due to the shrinking of the vortex cores , which occurs at the critical velocity @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the applied magnetic field and @xmath12 the distance between voltage contacts .",
    "the lo model describes the instability both in ltscs@xcite and htscs@xcite , whenever the basic assumptions of the model are satisfied , i.e. , temperature near @xmath3 and small magnetic field , in which the quasiparticle distribution can be assumed spatially uniform . in its original formulation ,",
    "the lo model predicts an almost field - independent critical vortex velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the experimental evidence of a field - dependent critical velocity can be described by an empirical extension of the original model@xcite . at low applied magnetic fields",
    ", it has been found that @xmath14 , as a direct consequence of the spatial homogeneity of the non - equilibrium quasiparticle distribution in the surrounding of abrikosov vortices@xcite .",
    "moreover , the lo model predicts a monotonic decrease of temperature - dependent vortex velocity @xmath13 near @xmath3 .",
    "however , substantial deviations can be observed due to the competition between quasiparticle scattering and recombination processes@xcite .    at temperatures well below @xmath3 instead , the electronic instability can be related to the electron overheating@xcite . due to dissipations in the flux - flow regime ,",
    "electrons reach temperatures above the phonon temperature , which leads to an expansion of the vortex core and a consequent reduction of the viscous drag .",
    "the signature of the instability in the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves is very similar in the lo and in the electron overheating regime , despite the different mechanisms present in the two distinct temperature ranges .",
    "recently , a crossover from electron heating at low temperatures to the lo regime near @xmath3 has been observed in nanostructured @xmath15-nbge films@xcite , at the reduced temperature @xmath16 .",

    "the quenching of the superconducting state can also occur due to the joule self - heating caused by thermal dissipations of the vortex flow .",

    "it is claimed that , under certain experimental conditions , heating effects become predominant@xcite , and at sufficiently high current densities , cuprate htscs become thermally unstable@xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "for @xmath23 the instability is triggered by an intrinsic change of the distribution function of quasiparticles trapped in the vortex core , whereas for @xmath24 it is driven by pure thermal effects@xcite .",

    "[ ] for htsc thin films ( ybco )",
    ". however , in our case , the temperature increase @xmath45 is smaller than @xmath66k below the instability .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to the different thermal properties of ybco and fe(se , te ) , but also to the difference between our pulsed biasing technique and the ramp method used in ref .",
    "[ ] . for the specific pulsed technique employed ,",
    "the temperature increase @xmath45 can be easily related to power dissipations in the flux - flow regime .",
    "in fact , during a single rectangular pulse the current can be assumed as uniformly distributed over the sample cross section .",
    "moreover , due to the long current - off time used between two consecutive current pulses , the initial temperature of the sample can be assumed to coincide with the bath temperature @xmath43 for all pulses . under these assumptions , the steady - state heat balance yields",
    "@xmath67 , i.e. , the temperature increase @xmath45 is proportional to the joule power dissipation @xmath68 .",

    "the parameter @xmath73 , inferred by the best fit of the temperature @xmath62 as a function of the power @xmath74 , yields the temperature dependence of the heat - transfer coefficient @xmath46 reported in the bottom inset of [ fig:3](a ) .",
    "a quite constant value @xmath75w/@xmath76k is observed up to 16k , which gives a stekly parameter @xmath77 .",
    "this value corresponds to an intermediate regime where self - heating is neither negligible ( @xmath34 ) nor overcomes intrinsic effects ( @xmath33)@xcite .",
    "we remind that the value of the stekly parameter strongly depends on material properties , film thickness , and on the heat flow at the film / bath and film / substrate interfaces , which is described by the heat transfer coefficient @xmath31 .",
    "in particular the heat flow at the film / substrate interface is mainly determined by its thermal resistance , which is affected by the quality of the interface , i.e. , disorder and roughness , and by the differences in electronic and phononic properties between the film and substrate .",
    "different cooling environments and substrates , as well as the current bias technique and the quality of the sample , may change the value of the stekly parameter and hence the relative importance of the thermal effects on the voltage instability in superconducting microbridges . in the case of competing intrinsic and thermal effects , the analysis of experimental data at different applied magnetic fields can give valuable information .",

    "the quasiparticle scattering time can be obtained from its relation with the diffusion length@xcite @xmath93 , which gives @xmath94s .",
