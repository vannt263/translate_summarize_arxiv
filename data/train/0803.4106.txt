    "einstein preferred a finite universe , bounded in space , over an infinite one because he wanted to avoid posing boundary conditions .",
    "what einstein really disliked was that in open universes some of the motion of inertial frames is due to dragging by matter while the rest is due to the boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "thirty - four years ago the authors of acclaimed `` gravitation '' @xcite commented on the einstein view in a footnote on p. 704 : `` many workers in cosmology are skeptical of einstein s boundary condition of closure of the universe , and will remain so until astronomical observations confirm it '' . the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe has now provided data @xcite which , among many other things , have constrained the present value of total mass - energy density parameter of the universe to be @xmath0 . with such a result , all three basic sets of standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) are compatible : the models with flat spatial sections ( with curvature index @xmath1 ) , positive spatial curvature models @xmath2 , as well as negative curvature @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , the wmap data ` marginally prefer ' @xmath4 ( see , in particular , @xcite ) , and , indeed , recently several authors studied closed models again in detail ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , after years of preference of flat universes which have been considered as natural outcomes of inflation .",
    "even an idea going back to the eddington - lematre cosmology has now been revived : if our universe is closed today , it was always closed , and perhaps inflation is ` past - eternal '  the universe , dominated at early times by a single scalar field , could have started asymptotically from an initial einstein static universe which enters an inflationary expanding phase , succeeded then by standard evolution ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the recent growing evidence for the existence of a cosmological constant @xmath5 has been an inspiration for the reconsideration of spatially closed universe of de sitter type @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we do not , technically , bestow a privilege to any value of spatial curvature .",
    "all three cases @xmath6 are analyzed in equal detail , and we even discuss , albeit briefly , closed hyperbolic and closed flat universes with multiconnected topologies . from the physical ( to some extent perhaps ` philosophical ' ) point of view , we adhere to the einstein preference , i.e. , to the closed universes with standard ( spherical ) topology , because our work on cosmological perturbation theory has been motivated by mach s principle .",
    "mach s principle has acquired certain unpopularity among some relativity and cosmology circles .",
    "the primary reason is perhaps the fact that under that name a range of meanings and interpretations , sometimes even mutually contradictory , has gradually accumulated . during the prague conference in 1988 to celebrate the 150th anniversary from mach s birth @xcite and , in particular , at the tbingen conference in 1993 devoted entirely to mach s principle , numerous interpretations have been given ( see the excellent book @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , bondi and samuel @xcite listed the ` zeroth ' plus ten other versions of mach s principle and described within which theoretical framework a particular statement of the principle applies  see also @xcite , where the main formulations from @xcite and @xcite are summarized . a brief history of mach s principle and its meaning in general relativity and cosmology is given in the introduction to our first paper on the subject @xcite .    despite a possible scepticism as regard the role of mach s principle in contemporary cosmology ,",
    "most of the standard treatises on the subject do include a discussion of the principle ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and no one can deny mach s ideas have been a source of inspiration to many , not only einstein .",
    "one of the purposes of the present work is to demonstrate that a search for a framework in which mach s principle can be best embodied in the cosmological perturbation theory can lead to practical results , such as the formulation of the perturbation theory in a completely general gauge , followed by the selection of an advantageous ` machian gauge ' for solving specific problems .",
    "what then do we mean by mach s principle ?",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , as a starting point we adapt the original bondi s formulation from his classical ` cosmology ' @xcite : `` local inertial frames are determined through the distributions of energy and momentum in the universe by some weighted averages of the apparent motions '' . more specifically , we turn primarily to those among einstein s equations for linear perturbations of the frw models which represent the constraints , i.e. , under suitable conditions partial differential equations of elliptic type , connecting the ` initial values ' for matter perturbations with the perturbations of the metric . in @xcite",
    "we went quite a way in realizing the machian program .",
    "we studied the frame - dragging effects due to slowly , rigidly rotating , but collapsing or expanding spheres in the ( inhomogeneous ) lematre - tolman - bondi universes , and we analyzed the dragging effects of vector perturbations of the frw universes described in a special gauge such that three ( momentum ) constraint equations enabled us to determine instantaneously metric perturbations @xmath7 in terms of energy - momentum perturbations @xmath8 . in the open universes ,",
    "these are determined uniquely by requiring the perturbations to vanish at infinity  rotations are ` absolute ' in this sense .",
    "in closed universes a linear combination of six killing vectors ( three rotations plus three quasitranslations ) may be added to the @xmath9 .",
    "we still obtain the solutions of the three constraint equations when angular momenta corresponding to the three rotations and quasimomenta corresponding to the three quasitranslations of the sources ( determined by @xmath10 ) are given . in this sense",
    "no absolute rotations exist in closed universe , only differences of rotation rates are determinable  in accord with mach s ideas that ` all motions are relative ' . if , however , the _ velocities _ of the bodies , described by perturbations of perfect fluid , are given , the metric perturbations @xmath9 are determined uniquely .",
    "the last result is related to the fundamental fact that six globally conserved quantities , corresponding to the six killing vectors in a frw universe , must all vanish if considered for the whole closed universe .",
    "the conserved quantities , being the derivatives of superpotentials , can be expressed as surface integrals like an electric charge by using gauss theorem . as the volume surrounded by the surface",
    "is expanded over all the universe at a given time , the surface must shrink to zero .",
    "it was , among others , an attempt to understand mach s principle in cosmological perturbation theory , which inspired us to formulate conservation laws with respect to curved backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the resulting ` kbl superpotential ' , using the designation by julia and silva @xcite , was found , after applying certain natural criteria , to be unambigous and most satisfactory in spacetimes with or without a cosmological constant , in any spacetime dimension @xmath11 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it also found applications in the recent studies of the causal generation of cosmological perturbations seeding large - scale structure formation and of the back reactions in slow - roll inflation ( see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in the present paper we study _ general _ linear perturbations of the frw universes from a ` machian perspective ' .",
    "this leads us to investigate both rotations and accelerations of local inertial frames in perturbed universes , and to develop _ all _ the perturbed einstein equations in a general gauge ` ab initio ' .",
    "observational evidence for isotropy and homogeneity of the universe shows that it is broadly well described by a frw model , but the clustering , the galaxies and the stars constitute local perturbations from the idealized substratums of cosmological models .",
    "the other goal of cosmological perturbation theory is to link the physical conditions in the early universe with structures observed today . from the pioneering work of lifshitz in 1946",
    "( see review in @xcite ) , there appeared numerous papers studying linear perturbations of frw universes ; for the more recent extensive reviews , see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors have even found the impetus and skill to write down the complicated system of equations for the second - order perturbations of the frw models ",
    "see @xcite and references therein  but applications of these are yet to appear .    in any cosmological perturbation theory ,",
    "two problems at once confront us : ( i ) what smooth cosmological model is best suited to our universe , and ( ii ) how do we map the points of our inhomogeneous universe onto a chosen cosmological model .",
    "both these problems are , in relativity , connected with the gauge freedom that changes the apparent form of the perturbations by which our universe differs from the smooth cosmological model adopted . although the first problem is primarily connected with a difficult question of an appropriate averaging of an inhomogeneous universe , or so - called ` fitting problem ' ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is also related to the gauge problem because two different frw universes can be close to one another , at least for some time , so one can be considered as a perturbation of another .",
    "when we have chosen an appropriate background , then we are confronted with the freedom to choose coordinates in the real universe differently and so to remap the universe onto the background model .",
    "this gives rise to the commonly discussed gauge freedom .",
    "of course , what happens in the real world is independent of what background is used and how we map onto it .",
    "this is the motive behind gauge invariant perturbation theory , and this made the work of bardeen @xcite in 1980 , in which gauge invariant quantities combined from cosmological perturbations were first introduced , so influential .",
    "the gauge problem is explained in technical terms from different ( equivalent ) perspectives in depth in the literature : one can consider a one - parameter family of 4-dimensional manifolds , with @xmath12 a background and @xmath13 a perturbed universe , embedded in a 5-dimensional manifold @xmath14 and connected by a `` point identification map '' which is specified by a vector field @xmath15 on @xmath14 transverse to the manifolds @xmath16 ; the gauge transformation is then a change of @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , in a more physical vein , in any chosen coordinate system in the real universe one assigns to all physical quantities @xmath17 also their background values @xmath18 .",
    "these , in contrast to @xmath17 , do not change their functional dependence on coordinates under an infinitesimal coordinate transformation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , any of these approaches lead to the changes of physical quantities as they appear in the following ( see , in particular , section iv ) .",
    "there exists a well - known lemma @xcite stating that the linear perturbation of a quantity is gauge invariant only if the quantity vanishes on the background or is a constant ( scalar or linear combination of products of kronecker delta ) .",
    "the density perturbation @xmath19 , for example , is not gauge invariant since @xmath20 is time - dependent function in the frw backgrounds .",
    "that is why to obtain a gauge invariant quantity , one has to consider , e.g. , the gradients of density perturbation or combine @xmath19 with some other quantities . however , as in the black - hole perturbation theory , solving for gauge invariant quantities may not mean finding all quantities of interest . for example , in the problem of the motion of a charged black hole in a weak asymptotically uniform electric field",
    ", there is only one gauge invariant quantity .",
    "we need to fix the gauge at the end in order to find all perturbations of the metric and electromagnetic field to see how the hole accelerates @xcite .",
    "it is advantageous at the start to have the possibility of a gauge choice according to the problem in hand . selecting a gauge which implies a physically preferable coordinate system",
    "may eventually give both a better physical understanding and an easier mathematical procedure .",
    "after all , motions in the solar system can be described as seen from a frame that rotates to keep a planet ` at rest ' , but are much more readily comprehended in newton s inertial axes .",
    "last but not least , physical effects associated with mach s ideas like the dragging of inertial frames are of a global nature and they do require the introduction of suitable coordinate frames ( the ` gauges ' ) . a true understanding of inertia and inertial frames must involve specific frames or coordinates . to borrow dieter brill s comment from ref .",
    "@xcite : `` mach s principle may point the way toward giving physical meaning to quantities usually considered frame - dependent''.we return to this issue in the concluding remarks where some of our other work on machian effects @xcite , @xcite is summarized in the context of the present paper .",
    "there exist many frameworks for treating linearized perturbations of frw universes .",
    "the one which has been used most frequently involves the synchronous gauge , with all quantities decomposed into suitable harmonics in accordance with the spatial curvature . in what follows",
    "we make a general study of advantageous gauges without imposing _ a priori _ conditions on them and without decomposition into harmonics .",
    "_ we identify desirable gauges as those which embody best mach s principle_. we find that these gauges are also motivated by the gauge choices used in full nonlinear general relativity .",
    "most importantly , however , they are distinguished by the simplifications they bring both to the perturbed einstein equations and to their physical interpretation",
    ".    what do we mean by mach s principle within this broader framework ?",
    "we again start from bondi s formulation that `` local inertial frames are determined through the distributions of energy and momentum in the universe by some weighted averages '' . however , to determine a local inertial frame in a general situation means to _ find _ both its ` _ _ rotation and acceleration _ _ ' from the distributions of energy and momentum , represented by @xmath21 . in a general situation",
    "we need to know the full spacetime metric in a neighborhood of a point in order to determine completely local inertial frames at that point ; see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite . in wheeler s conception of mach s",
    "principle ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , we have to specify the initial data on a cauchy spacelike surface like the conformal three - geometry and the mass - energy currents , solve for the spacetime geometry @xmath22 , and thus determine local inertial frames . in general , gravitational waves will globally also contribute to the dragging of the inertial frames but only when the waves are nonlinear perturbations of a fwr universe .",
    "however , limiting ourselves to the linear perturbations of the frw universes , it is interesting to see what data are needed to determine the ` accelerations ' and ` rotations ' of local inertial frames with respect to what we call the _ cosmological ( observers ) frames_. in a perturbed frw universe , can a gauge be found such that the distribution of @xmath21 determines uniquely and instantaneously the rotations and accelerations of local inertial frames via einstein s field equations ?",
    "after first reviewing the properties of a general congruence of timelike worldlines in a general spacetime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we consider the congruence of ` cosmological observers ' in a perturbed frw universe with coordinates @xmath23 as a ` perturbation ' of the congruence of fundamental observers in the frw background .",
    "we assume that in a ` cosmological gauge ' @xmath23 the cosmological observers move along @xmath24 constants , but we describe the properties of their congruence by covariant expressions which can be calculated in any coordinates .",
    "the cosmological observers are equipped with their local frame vectors ; the timelike ones are their 4-velocities , and the spacelike ones lie along their connecting vectors .",
    "now a cosmological observer is , in general , _ accelerated _ with respect to a local freely falling inertial frame , in particular , the one which at a given spacetime point moves with the same 4-velocity . expressing this acceleration in terms of the metric perturbations , we find that only certain components of the metric perturbations are needed .",
    "next , we determine the _ rotation _ of the axes of the cosmological observer with respect to the nonrotating rigid orthogonal axes ( gyroscopes held in their centres of mass ) of the local inertial frame . having the acceleration @xmath25 and the angular velocity @xmath26 expressed ,",
    "we have _ determined the local inertial frame : _ it accelerates and rotates with respect to the corresponding cosmological frame with just the opposite vectors , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "all these issues are analyzed in section ii .",
    "assuming a general congruence of cosmological observers , i.e. , equivalently , a general gauge , we find that in order to determine the accelerations and ( avaraged ) rotations of local inertial frames in the sense just described , we need to know the metric perturbations @xmath29 and @xmath30 and their first derivatives .",
    "the main issue in sections iii and iv is to find and study the gauges in which these quantities can be determined instantaneously from the knowledge of energy - momentum distributions @xmath31 .",
    "we give the perturbed einstein equations for all three types of frw universes with any value of @xmath5 , in an arbitrary gauge .",
    "we first adopt the ` relativists ' attitude and start from the perturbed frw metric in the form    @xmath32    where the spatial background metric is @xmath33 @xmath34 is the ` cosmic time ' , so @xmath35 .",
    "perturbations @xmath36 are small so that quadratic terms can be neglected . in one of the standard coordinate systems the background frw metric @xmath37 reads @xmath38,\\ ] ]",
    "where in a positive curvature ( closed ) universe @xmath39 , in flat @xmath40 and negative curvature @xmath41 open universes @xmath42 .",
    "we shall also employ other common alternatives as , e.g. , hyperspherical coordinates , @xmath43,\\ ] ] with @xmath44h @xmath45 for , respectively , @xmath46 .",
    "the perturbations @xmath21 are left general , but a perturbed perfect fluid is considered as an example . in appendix [ app.a ]",
    "we give all the perturbed einstein s equations and the bianchi identities starting off from ; in section iii we give them using conformal time @xmath47 and metric perturbations defined as is usual in the cosmological literature , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite  again in a completely general gauge .",
    "we do not decompose the perturbations in harmonics nor do we first separate them into the scalar , vector and tensor parts ( used , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "although both methods are very useful in cosmology , they involve nonlocal operations . in order to make fourier - type analyses in the space variables",
    ", one needs to know quantities in the whole space , which is not ` typical ' in cosmology .",
    "the splitting of a local perturbation into some scalar , vector and tensor perturbations is also nonlocal .",
    "imagine a trivial ( zero ) perturbation in a given domain @xmath48 , and extend it to an annulus @xmath49 so that it is nonvanishing there .",
    "hence , in @xmath48 the trivial perturbation will split into nontrivial ( scalar , vector , tensor ) pieces which depend on the extension into @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , a perturbation which is the sum of scalar , vector , and tensor parts can not be uniquely expressed in terms of the bardeen gauge invariant variables @xcite which are defined separately for each part . without using harmonics or splittings , the perturbed einstein field equations are in a form suitable for searching for solutions in terms of green s functions .",
    "how the green s function approach can reveal new aspects of cosmological perturbation theory has been recently indicated by bashinsky and bertschinger  @xcite . in section iv ,",
    "the main purpose is to motivate and describe geometrically several gauges in which the accelerations and rotations of the local inertial frames follow instantaneously from the field equations .",
    "we call these",
    "_ machian gauges_. we also clarify the residual gauge freedom that these gauges admit , and make a comparison with two typically non - machian gauges  the synchronous gauge and the generalized lorenz - de donder ( ` harmonic ' ) gauge .",
    "the machian gauges turn out to admit much less residual freedom .",
    "the freedom represented by the gauge transformations generated by the conformal killing vectors in closed ( spherical ) universes is removed by the _",
    "integral gauge conditions _ which we impose . in closed hyperbolic universes our machian local gauge conditions fix coordinates uniquely .",
    "finally , in section v we give the field equations in the mach 1 gauge and show how they can be solved to give the local inertial frames when the distribution of the matter energy - momentum is given .",
    "we also discuss traschen s integral - constraint vectors @xcite , @xcite restricting possible @xmath21 . according to traschen and others @xcite , @xcite",
    ", their existence has implications for the sachs - wolfe effect and for microwave background anisotropies .",
    "traschen considered these vectors in the synchronous gauge .",
    "by contrast , in the mach 1 gauge , these constraints become a straightforward consequence of the constraint equations and acquire a simple , lucid meaning .",
    "we find integral constraints also on quantities not considered by traschen . in closed universes these integral constraints are satisfied automatically as a consequence of our integral gauge conditions by which motions generated by the spatial conformal killing vectors are eliminated . in section",
    "v we also list all green s functions known in literature which solve the constraint equations needed for the determination of the local inertial frames ; some are still unknown .",
    "we then review our recent work @xcite , @xcite on vorticity perturbations of frw universes and study their effect on local inertial frames . as a second example , we consider perturbations of potential type for which the vorticity vanishes . at the end",
    "we analyze the ` machian ' question of how uniquely local inertial frames are determined in perturbed universes .    in concluding remarks ( sec .",
    "vi ) we briefly summarize the results and discuss global aspects of mach s principle . in appendix [ app.c ] the killing and conformal killing vectors in frw universes are listed , and those harmonics which are needed in the main text are given . in appendix [ app.d ]",

    "we thus arrive at another important _ aspect of mach s principle _ in relativistic cosmology : _ if the velocities , density and pressure perturbations of cosmic fluid are given , the ( linearized ) field equations in a closed universe provide a unique determination of the rotations and accelerations of the local inertial frames_.",
    "although this paper includes also items which have a review character , primarily it contains new developments : the analysis of accelerations and rotations of local inertial frames and of gyroscopes in perturbed frw universes ; the general forms of the perturbed einstein field equations and bianchi identities are formulated without gauge conditions , harmonics , or splittings , the motivation for and the analysis of the instantaneous , machian - based gauges , including the integral gauge conditions and their relation to traschen s integral constraints ; and the manifestation of mach s ideas in the framework of general linear cosmological perturbations of frw universes . in particular , those who wish to study cosmological perturbation problems in position space , as advocated recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , may find here useful relations not given before .",
    "various specific perturbation problems can be attacked by applying the results presented here .",
    "we already used the formalism to investigate rotational and toroidal vector perturbations of frw universes @xcite , @xcite , as mentioned and applied in section v ; there we also discussed vector perturbations of potential type .    for given distributions of energy - momentum and angular momentum of matter sources , the rotations and accelerations of local inertial frames are uniquely given in the machain gauges in open universes under suitable boundary conditions , whereas in closed universes they are determined up to motions generated by the killing vectors , i.e. , by symmetries of the background .",
    "they are determined uniquely also in closed universes if velocities , density , and pressure perturbations of cosmic fluid are given . as a consequence of the constraint equations and the choice of gauges which imply suitable slicing of perturbed universes ,",
    "these inertial properties are determined instantaneously . in this sense mach s principle",
    "is embodied in the cosmological linear perturbation theory .",
    "the dragging of inertial frames is an essentially _ global effect _ which , at least in linear perturbation theory , has to be seen as an instantaneous phenomenon .",
    "this was first demonstrated by lindblom and brill @xcite , who investigated rotational dragging by a slowly rotating , massive spherical shell freely falling under its own gravity .",
    "we reconsidered the problem and explored its electromagnetic analogue @xcite .",
    "the need to introduce a suitable coordinate frame ( the ` gauge ' ) to describe the dragging is well illustrated inside the shell .",
    "spacetime is flat there ; no local geometrical ( gauge invariant ) perturbations occur .",
    "the time - dependent rotation of inertial frames is exhibited by considering the congruence of static observers , i.e. those who are at rest with respect to static observers at infinity .",
    "they play the role analogous to that of the cosmological observers in the present paper .",
    "they experience acceleration , and the congruence of their worldlines twists .",
    "both quantities , characterizing their congruence , can be expressed in a covariant manner as in formulae and for cosmological observers .",

    "<S> linear perturbations of friedmann - robertson - walker universes with any curvature and cosmological constant are studied in a general gauge without decomposition into harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> desirable gauges are selected as those which embody best mach s principle : in these gauges local inertial frames can be determined instantaneously via the perturbed einstein field equations from the distributions of energy and momentum in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the inertial frames are identified by their ` accelerations and rotations ' with respect to the cosmological frames associated with the ` machian gauges ' . in closed spherical universes , </S>",
    "<S> integral gauge conditions are imposed to eliminate motions generated by the conformal killing vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the meaning of traschen s integral constraint vectors is thus elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> for all three types of frw universes the machian gauges admit much less residual freedom than the synchronous or generalized harmonic gauge . </S>",
    "<S> mach s principle is best exhibited in the machian gauges in closed spherical universes . </S>",
    "<S> independent of any machian motivation the general perturbation equations and discussion of gauges are useful for cosmological perturbation theory </S>",
