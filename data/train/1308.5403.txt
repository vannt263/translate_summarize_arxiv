    "the thermodynamics of black holes has been an active area of research ever since bekenstein and hawking s seminal papers on the entropy and temperature associated with the event horizon of a black hole , @xcite .",
    "recently the rle of pressure and volume has come under scrutiny in this context .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the presence of a cosmological constant , @xmath2 , spoils the otherwise successful smarr relation @xcite and a remedy was proposed : to raise @xmath2 to the status of a thermodynamic variable , on a par with the temperature , while at the same time the black hole mass should be interpreted as the thermodynamic potential associated with the enthalpy , rather than the heretofore more usual interpretation of internal energy .",
    "it is then very natural to identify @xmath2 as being proportional to a pressure and the thermodynamic variable conjugate to the pressure can be interpreted as a volume for the black hole @xcite .",
    "the idea of promoting @xmath2 to the status of a thermodynamic variable is not new , @xcite-@xcite , but it is only recently that a volume has entered the picture in this context . for a rotating black hole in four dimensions this thermodynamic volume does not have an obvious relation to any geometric volume , though they agree if the black hole is not rotating , @xcite . nevertheless , with the volume included , there is a remarkable similarity between the black hole equation of state and that of a van der waals gas , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we can not vary @xmath2 in our universe but we can nevertheless gain considerable conceptual insight into the nature of black hole thermodynamics by performing a gedanken experiment performing such a variation .",
    "varying @xmath2 can have definite consequences : treating it as a thermodynamic variable , interpreted as a pressure , introduces a @xmath3 term into the first law of black hole thermodynamics which affects the efficiency of a penrose process . in 4-dimensions , for example",
    ", the maximal efficiency for energy extraction from a rotating electrically neutral black hole is increased from 29% in asymptotically flat space - time to 52% in asymptotically anti - de sitter space - time , while for an electrically charged black hole the corresponding figures are 50% and 75% , @xcite .",
    "of course we do not live in anti - de sitter space , so this observation is unlikely to have observable consequences , just as the hawking temperature has no observable consequences for astrophysical black holes .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting conceptually to think about the possible consequences of such a variation .",
    "for example a negative cosmological constant can stabilise an otherwise thermodynamically unstable black hole , provided @xmath4 is of sufficient magnitude , leading to the well - known hawking - page transition @xcite .",
    "also in the ads / cft correspondence approach to condensed matter systems @xcite , a negative cosmological constant could generate a positive pressure in the condensed matter system , a pressure which in general we would wish to be able to vary .",
    "asymptotically anti - de sitter space - time , in different dimensions , is also of central importance in the gauge gravity / correspondence @xcite and its applications in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "a consequence of this correspondence is a relation between the value of the cosmological constant ( or , equivalently , the square of the anti - de sitter curvature length @xmath5 ) , the planck length @xmath6 and the number of colours in the @xmath7 gauge theory , @xmath8 , so varying @xmath2 is varying @xmath9 , and @xmath10 in the classical limit .",
    "as long as @xmath9 is very large there is nothing wrong with considering it to be a continuous variable ( this is exactly how the number of particles in a gas is treated in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "insights into the gauge / gravity correspondence might well be gained by considering the number of colours to be a thermodynamic variable .",
    "an important physical quantity in any thermodynamics system that behaves like a gas is the compressibility : low compressibility implies a stiff equation of state and a stable system while a large compressibility implies a soft equation of state and a system which is verging on instability . investigating",
    "the compressibility of a black hole solution therefore offers the possibility of learning something about stability without leaving the parametric framework of the solution .",
    "the compressibility of rotating , asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes in 4-dimensions was investigated in @xcite , including asymptotically flat space - times as a limiting case . in that work",
    "it was shown that the thermodynamic compressibility of a rotating solar mass black hole in asymptotically flat space - time is some 4 orders of magnitude less the that of a neutron star of similar mass , sustained by degeneracy pressure .    in this paper",
    "the investigation of the compressibility of rotating black holes is extended to dimensions greater than four , where it is known that there are instabilities for ultra - spinning black holes . to that end",
    "we first derive the compressibility of a rotating asymptotically ads myers - perry black hole in @xmath0 space - time dimensions .",
    "our aim is to derive the compressibility and the speed of sound for asymptotically flat myers - perry black holes , but we must include a non - zero @xmath2 in order to obtain the volume and the compressibility before taking the limit @xmath11 . in this limit",
    "the expressions simplify considerably and the compressibility and the speed of sound can be expressed rather compactly in terms of the quadratic and quartic casimirs of @xmath1 associated with the angular momenta of the black hole .",
    "as was emphasised in @xcite , it is crucial that one starts with rotating black holes : if there is no rotation the entropy @xmath12 and the volume @xmath13 are both functions of the event horizon radius @xmath14 only  they are not independent and can not be considered to be independent thermodynamic variables  they become independent only when the black hole rotates .",
    "this is not a pathology it is merely due to the fact the legendre transform is not well defined in the limit of zero rotation .",
    "the enthalpy , @xmath15 , is linear in @xmath16 when @xmath17 and hence the legendre transform is not invertible in this limit .",
    "everything is well defined as @xmath18 , provided one takes all derivatives and performs any desired legendre transforms first before setting @xmath17 . setting @xmath17 at the start misses crucial aspects of the thermodynamics as far as the thermodynamic volume is concerned , but everything is consistent if the @xmath17 case is always approached by setting @xmath19 first and only letting @xmath18 after any necessary manipulations involving legendre transforms have been done .",
    "it is well known that kerr black holes are thermodynamically unstable , indeed all of the rotating black hole space - times considered here are thermodynamically unstable in the asymptotically flat limit , @xcite . in @xmath20",
    "the schwarzschild black hole can be stabilised by placing it in a cavity with a heat bath at a finite distance from the horizon @xcite or by switching on a negative cosmological constant @xcite of sufficient magnitude .",
    "a negative cosmological constant can also stabilise rotating black holes in @xmath21 though , while it may be possible to stabilise rotating black holes by using a rotating cavity of finite size , it seems unlikely that one could ignore back - reaction and recover an asymptotically flat space - time if the radius of the cavity is sent to infinity .",
    "nevertheless one can gain significant insight into black hole thermodynamics by analysing thermodynamically unstable black holes , indeed this is how hawking made the discovery that black holes could evaporate . in this work we shall only consider isolated asymptotically ads black holes ( which can be stable if the magnitude of @xmath2 is large enough ) and their asymptotically flat limits .    an issue that should be addressed in discussing black hole thermodynamics is the rle of extensive versus intensive variables . in standard thermodynamics",
    "it is clear which variables scale with the volume of the system and which do not . in black hole thermodynamics , with @xmath22",
    ", all relevant thermodynamic variables can be made to scale with dimensions of length to some power by judicial use of newton s constant . in @xmath0 space - time dimensions the key players for an electrically neutral black hole , which is the case for the analysis presented here , have the following length dimensions :    [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     identifying the mass with the enthalpy @xmath23 gives d h = t d s + _",
    "i dj^i + v d p and scaling produces the smarr relation ( d-3)m = ( d-2 ) s t + ( d-2 ) _",
    "i j^i -2 pv .    it is thus very natural to interpret the variables whose scaling depends on the space - time dimension @xmath0 as extensive and those whose dimension is independent of @xmath0 as intensive , and this will be the point of view adopted in this work .",
    "thus @xmath24 , @xmath12 , @xmath25 and @xmath13 are considered to be extensive , while @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath16 are intensive .",
    "the internal energy @xmath28 is thus a function of purely extensive variables , @xcite , while the enthalpy is not .",
    "we restrict the analysis here to asymptotically ads and asymptotically flat space - times .",
    "the thermodynamics of black holes in @xmath29 space - times is a notoriously delicate issue .",
    "first steps in understanding the rle of a thermodynamic volume of black holes in this case were taken in @xcite but unresolved issues remain , these are left for future work and are avoided here by restricting to @xmath30 .    in section  [ adsmpholes ]",
    "we summarise the relevant features of asymptotically ads myers - perry black holes , determine the thermodynamic volume and describe the compressibility , the main result is the compressibility in equation ( [ eq : kappa ] ) . in  [ mpholes ] the @xmath11 , asymptotically flat , limit is investigated ; the compressibility , given in ( [ eq : kappazero ] ) and speed of sound in ( [ eq : speedofsound ] ) , are derived and physical implications are discussed , particularly in relation to ultra - spinning black holes in @xmath21 .",
    "the conclusions discuss some implications of the results and possible future directions .",
    "finally some technical details are confined to two appendices .",
    "rotating black holes in @xmath0-dimensions must be treated slightly differently for even and odd @xmath0 because the rotation group @xmath1 , acting on the event horizon which is assumed to have the topology of a @xmath31-dimensional sphere , has different characterisations of angular momenta in the even and odd dimensional cases .",
    "the cartan sub - algebra has dimension @xmath32 for even @xmath0 and @xmath33 for odd @xmath0 so a general state of rotation is specified by @xmath32 independent angular momenta in even @xmath0 and @xmath33 in odd @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath34 , the integral part of @xmath33 , be the dimension of the cartan sub - algebra of @xmath1 , then there are @xmath35 independent angular momenta @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "it is notationally convenient to define @xmath38 , so @xmath39 for even @xmath0 and @xmath40 for odd @xmath0 , and then = 2 .    in this notation",
    "the unit @xmath31-dimensional sphere can be described in terms of cartesian co - ordinates @xmath41 in @xmath42 by _",
    "x_a^2 = 1,and we can write this as _ i=1^_i^2 + y^2=1,where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , are complex co - ordinates for both the even and odd cases while @xmath45 is only necessary for even @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are then ( redundant ) co - ordinates that can be used to parameterise the sphere and , for the black hole , @xmath36 are angular momenta in the @xmath49-plane .",

    "when all the @xmath90 are small the compressibility is small and the equation of state is very stiff , the black hole is completely incompressible for @xmath101 .",

    "again a thermodynamic speed of sound can be defined using = which gives , with ( [ eq : kappazero ] ) in ( [ eq : cs ] ) , c_s^2= .[eq : speedofsound ]    it is not immediately clear how the thermodynamic speed of sound might be related to a fluid dynamical speed of sound , but it is noteworthy that the thermodynamic speed of sound is least when the compressibility is greatest , as one would expect for a soft equation of state .",
    "indeed @xmath113 with @xmath114 for @xmath101 and @xmath115 as any one @xmath116 with all others remaining finite .",
    "it is possible that the thermodynamic speed of sound is related to the velocity of the kind of waves and vibrations envisaged in @xcite associated with the instability of an ultra - spinning black hole , at least for @xmath21 .",
    "a cosmological constant spoils the smarr relation for black hole thermodynamics unless it is given the status of a thermodynamic variable , most naturally interpreted as proportional to a pressure .",
    "a consistent interpretation of the adm mass of the black hole , in terms of thermodynamic potentials , is that it is the enthalpy of the black hole . a thermodynamic volume",
    "can then be defined as being the thermodynamic variable conjugate to the pressure , in terms of legendre transforms .",
    "the main results are the thermodynamic volume ( [ eq : volume ] ) , computed explicitly as the legendre transform variable conjugate of the pressure rather than by assuming the smarr relation , and the compressibility ( [ eq : kappa ] ) for myers - perry black holes in asymptotically anti - de sitter , @xmath0-dimensional , space - time .",
    "the corresponding expressions for asymptotically flat space - times then follow easily from the @xmath117 limit , and the corresponding quantities for asymptotically flat myers - perry black holes are given in equations ( [ eq : volume ] ) and ( [ eq : kappazero ] ) respectively .",
    "in addition the speed of sound can be expressed in terms of casimirs of the rotation group , @xmath1 , and is given in ( [ eq : speedofsound ] ) .",

    "the volume is an independent thermodynamic variable only when the black hole rotates , otherwise the legendre transform is not well defined , as was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the isentropic compressibility ( [ eq : kappa ] ) vanishes as @xmath123 : fixing @xmath12 fixes @xmath13 when the black hole is non - rotating , hence it is incompressible .",
    "the discussion here has been restricted to electrically neutral rotating black holes , leaving open the question of how electric charge might affect compressibility .",
    "it would be very interesting to develop these ideas in the context of positive @xmath2 , but we immediately hit the problem of having two horizons to contend with , a black hole horizon and a cosmological horizon , leading to two , in general different , temperatures and raising the question of how to define thermodynamic potentials for such a system .",
    "a preliminary discussion of thermodynamic volumes in this context was given in @xcite , but only by treating the two horizons as essentially independent and defining two independent volumes .",
    "the volume associated with the black hole horizon in @xcite was the same as ( [ eq : volume ] ) , but with @xmath124 negative , and it is perhaps significant in this context that @xmath73 in ( [ eq : kappa ] ) remains positive under this continuation to negative @xmath125 , provided @xmath126 . however a completely consistent integrated thermodynamic treatment of asymptotically de sitter space - times still eludes us .",

    "we note that ( [ eq : mudef ] ) , ( [ eq : sdef ] ) , ( [ eq : jdef ] ) and ( [ eq : mdef ] ) allow us to write j_i= a_i and demanding @xmath127 then gives d a_i = \\{(1-r_h^2 ) ( 1-a_i^2 ) - ( r_h^2 + a_i^2 ) d[eq : dai ] } . a second relation between @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 follows from @xmath131 in ( [ eq : sdef ] ) , allowing the elimination of @xmath128 to give d r_h= ( ) r_h d,[eq : drh ] and we have all the ingredients necessary to calculate @xmath132 acting on any function of @xmath125 , @xmath14 and @xmath58 .",
