    "<S> a self - propelled artificial microswimmer is often modeled as a ballistic brownian particle moving with constant speed aligned along one of its axis , but changing direction due to random collisions with the environment . similarly to thermal noise , its angular randomization is described as a memoryless stochastic process . here , we speculate that finite - time correlations in the orientational dynamics can affect the swimmer s diffusivity . to this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we propose and solve two alternative models . in the first one we simply assume that the environmental fluctuations governing the swimmer s propulsion are exponentially correlated in time , whereas in the second one we account for possible damped fluctuations of the propulsion velocity around the swimmer s axis . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding swimmer s diffusion constants are predicted to get , respectively , enhanced or suppressed upon increasing the model memory time . </S>",
    "<S> possible consequences of this effect on the interpretation of the experimental data are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> an artificial microswimmer enhances its diffusivity by harvesting propulsion energy from its suspension fluid @xcite , as a result of some sort of functional asymmetry of its own @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the particle thus propels itself with constant speed @xmath0 , but keeps changing direction due to both environmental fluctuations ( and/or spatial disorder ) and the intrinsic randomness of the propulsion mechanism itself .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we restrict here our analysis to the two - dimensional case of an overdamped swimmer with coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 in a fixed cartesian frame , then its spatial diffusion is described by the langevin equations ( le ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the intensity of the thermal noise and @xmath5 denotes the instantaneous direction of the propulsion velocity with respect to the @xmath1 axis [ see inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] . to model the angular dynamics of the swimmer , </S>",
    "<S> two assumptions are generally made in the current literature ( with a few significant exceptions @xcite discussed below ) : ( a ) @xmath0 has a fixed direction in the particle s reference frame , say , along some symmetry axis , so that a change in the direction of the propulsion velocity implies a rotation of the swimmer ; ( b ) such rotations are assumed to be mostly of thermal nature and , therefore , uncorrelated in time . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the swimmer s angular dynamics is modeled by a third le , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the intensity of the rotational fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the noises appearing in all three les are gaussian , stationary , zero - mean valued , and delta - correlated , that is @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the exact result @xcite , @xmath10 $ ] , obtained by combining the general identity , @xmath11,\\ ] ] valid for any gaussian process @xmath5 , and the mean square displacement @xcite , @xmath12 , from the le ( [ phi0 ] ) , suggests to interpret the reciprocal of @xmath7 as an angular diffusion time . </S>",
    "<S> note that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phi0 ] ) still describes a memoryless process .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding swimmer s spatial diffusion constant has also an exact analytical expression @xcite , that is @xmath13 with @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath15 are experimentally accessible , so that @xmath7 is usually estimated from the above model - dependent expression for @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath4 and @xmath7 are often compared to assess their relationship as , respectively , the translational and rotational constant associated with a unique underlying diffusive mechanism @xcite . in this communication we show that releasing assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) itemized above impacts the estimate of @xmath7 and , as a consequence , the interpretation of its physical meaning .    _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) finite angular time correlation . _ </S>",
    "<S> we expect that rotational fluctuations of the swimmer and , therefore , random changes in the direction of its velocity are caused to an appreciable extent by the noisy nature of the propulsion mechanism itself @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complex interactions between the swimmer and the active suspension fluid occur on finite spatio - temporal scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing orientational fluctuations of the swimmer , contrary to assumption ( b ) , are thus characterized by at least one finite relaxation rate , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> stated otherwise , @xmath17 is more appropriately described by the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , @xmath18 the idea of adding an extra time scale , @xmath19 , in the angular relaxation mechanism of an active brownian particle is corroborated by the simulation work of peruani and morelli @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second order le ( [ phi1 ] ) reproduces the standard first - order stochastic differential eq . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting swimmer s dynamics is thus modeled through a set of four les , namely @xmath39 where all noises are defined as above and the auxiliary angle @xmath37 represents the misalignment between the instantaneous propulsion velocity and its mean [ see inset of fig . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ model2 ] ) exhibits normal diffusion as always expected for realistic self - phoretic swimmers , as long as one assumes observation times larger than @xmath44 @xcite . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> , we stress that the memory effects postulated here are intrinsic to the propulsion mechanism and should not mistaken for the additional inertial and translational memory effects considered by golestanian @xcite .    in order to apply kubo s formula , eq . </S>",

( [ d2total ] ) tends to @xmath50 vice versa , for a slowly relaxing @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the spatial diffusion approaches the even smaller value @xmath53 both limits closely reproduce the numerical data of fig . </S>",

    "<S> have been expressed in terms of a relaxation rate , respectively , @xmath16 and @xmath33 . in model </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) memory is deemed as intrinsic to the nonequilibrium microscopic processes responsible for the swimmer s propulsion  for instance , a shot - noise like sequence of finite - time pulses , or power - strokes , associated with the chemical reactions catalyzed by the active tips of the swimmer @xcite . in model ( 2 ) we argued that the direction of the shifts associated with such power - strokes may fluctuate around its average orientation in the body frame as an effect of the extended geometry of the swimmer s active . of course </S>",
    "<S> , the above memory mechanisms might well operate simultaneously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case , for instance , of the reaction - driven swimmers of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where two sources of velocity fluctuations are singled out , namely , the product particle density fluctuations and the randomness in the catalytic reaction that leads to the product particle release .    by inspecting figs 1(a ) and ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> we immediately recognize that finite memory - time corrections to the spatial diffusion constant have opposite sign : @xmath32 gets either enhanced or suppressed by decreasing the corresponding model relaxation rate , namely , @xmath16 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , and @xmath33 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation of these opposite behaviors is straightforward . in model ( 1 ) lowering @xmath16 means increasing the persistence time of the propulsion mechanism , which is known to cause excess diffusion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary , in model ( 2 ) weakening the restoring constant @xmath33 favors the spatial reorientation of the swimmer s kinematic velocity and , correspondingly , the suppression of its spatial diffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> these remarks have a practical consequence on the interpretation of the experimental data . upon ignoring memory effects , </S>",
    "<S> one determines @xmath0 and @xmath54 by direct measurements and extracts @xmath55 from the identity , @xmath56 , provided by the standard model , see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dstandard ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we reconsider such a procedure in view of model ( 1 ) , the computed @xmath57 must differ from @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ d1min ] ) for @xmath58 , @xmath59 . the same conclusion holds for model ( 2 ) , where eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ d2min ] ) for @xmath60 implies that @xmath61 and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ d2max ] ) for @xmath62 and @xmath63 yields @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , @xmath57 systematically under- or over - estimates @xmath7 , depending on which model better reproduces the active swimmer s dynamics .    in the regime of short memory times </S>",
    "<S> the difference @xmath65 is proportional to the ratios @xmath66 in model ( 1 ) and @xmath67 in model ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> being a measure of the spatio - temporal structure of the propulsion mechanism , the parameters introduced in model ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath16 , @xmath33 and @xmath68 , may vary with the physico - chemical properties of the active fluid , the fabrication specifics ( and defects ) of the active microswimmers , and their interactions with the surrounding fluid . as a consequence , the estimated values of @xmath57 also depend on all those factors . therefore , the measured quantity @xmath57 for an active swimmer can not be analyzed as the rotational counterpart of the translational diffusion constant , @xmath4 , if not after correcting , case by case , for the memory effects peculiar of the propulsion mechanism actually at work . variations of the @xmath7 to @xmath4 ratio under different swimmer s operation conditions have already been reported in the earlier literature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ concluding remarks . </S>",
    "<S> _ in this communication we emphasized the dynamical role of rotational fluctuations . in a forthcoming publication </S>",
    "<S> we will generalize both models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in various ways . in model ( 1 ) the constant propulsion speed , @xmath0 , will be explicitly derived from a _ fluctuating _ `` effective force '' to mimic the microscopic discreteness of the propulsion mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the average values of the such a propulsion force are typically rather large in comparison to its standard deviation , no significant contribution to the swimmer s diffusion is expected . </S>",
    "<S> model ( 2 ) , instead , can be conveniently improved to account for possible instability effects . due to its functional asymmetry , the center of mass and the center of the propulsion force acting upon a swimmer , like the janus particle in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1](a ) , may well rest a finite distance apart , say , along the symmetry axis . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the angular fluctuations of the propulsion velocity vector are associated with an additional instantaneous torque . </S>",
    "<S> although such a random torque has zero mean , it suffices to further suppress active diffusion . finally , for more asymmetric geometries , where the fluctuating propulsion velocity points in average at an angle from the swimmer s axis , @xmath69 , the ensuing nonzero average torque drives the swimmer along spiraling trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> these generalizations of model ( 2 ) will allow us to study the effects of chirality on active diffusion @xcite . </S>"
