    "einstein proposed his general theory of relativity , in which gravitation is described in terms of geometry , and it motivated the geometrization of other physical fields .",
    "one of the first attempts in this direction was made by weyl @xcite who proposed a more general theory in which gravitation and electromagnetism is also described geometrically .",
    "however , this theory was never considered seriously as it was based on the non - integrability of length transfer .",
    "later lyra @xcite suggested a modification of riemannian geometry by introducing a gauge function which removes the non - integrability condition of the length of a vector under parallel transport .",
    "subsequently , sen @xcite & sen and dunn @xcite proposed a new scalar tensor theory of gravitation .",
    "they constructed an analog of the einstein field equations based on lyra s geometry which in normal gauge may be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the displacement vector and other symbols have their usual meaning as in riemannian geometry .",
    "halford @xcite pointed out that the constant displacement vector field @xmath2 in lyra s geometry plays the role of a cosmological constant in the normal general relativistic treatment .",
    "halford @xcite showed that the scalar - tensor treatment based on lyra s geometry predicts the same effects , within observational limits , as in einstein s theory .",
    "several authors @xcite have studied cosmological models based on lyra s geometry with a constant displacement field vector . however , this restriction of the displacement field to be a constant is a coincidence and there is no a _",
    "priori_reason for it .",
    "singh et al .",
    "@xcite have studied bianchi type i , iii , kantowski - sachs and a new class of models with a time dependent displacement field and have made a comparative study of robertson - walker models with a constant deceleration parameter in einstein s theory with a cosmological terms and in the cosmological theory based on lyra s geometry .",
    "recently pradhan et al .",
    "@xcite and rahaman et al .",
    "@xcite have studied cosmological models based on lyra s geometry with constant and time time dependent displacement field in different context .",
    "the einstein s field equations are a coupled system of highly nonlinear differential equations and we seek physical solutions to the field equations for their applications in cosmology and astrophysics . in order to solve the field equations we normally assume a form for the matter content or that space - time admits killing vector symmetries @xcite .",
    "solutions to the field equations may also be generated by applying a law of variation for hubble s parameter which was proposed by berman @xcite .",
    "in simplest case the hubble law yields a constant value for the deceleration parameter .",
    "it is worth observing that most of the well - known models of einstein s theory and brans - dicke theory with curvature parameter @xmath3 , including inflationary models , are models with constant deceleration parameter . in earlier literature",
    "cosmological models with a constant deceleration parameter have been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "but redshift magnitude test has had a chequered history . during the 1960s and the 1970s ,",
    "it was used to draw very categorical conclusions .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath4 was then claimed to lie between @xmath5 and @xmath6 and thus it was claimed that the universe is decelerating .",
    "today s situation , we feel , is hardly different .",
    "observations ( knop et al .",
    "@xcite ; riess et al .",
    "@xcite ) of type ia supernovae ( sne ) allow to probe the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the main conclusion of these observations is that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "so we can consider the cosmological models with variable cosmological term and deceleration parameter .",
    "the readers are advised to see the papers by vishwakarma and narlikar @xcite and virey et al . @xcite and references therein for a review on the determination of the deceleration parameter from supernovae data .",

    "@xcite have studied the universe with time dependent deceleration parameter in presence of perfect fluid .",
    "motivated by the recent results on the boomerang experiment on cosmic microwave background radiation ( bernardis @xcite ) , we wish to study a spatially flat cosmological model . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated spatially non - flat and flat cosmological models with a time dependent displacement field within the framework of lyra s geometry .",
    "we have obtained exact solutions of the field equations of sen @xcite by taking the deceleration parameter to be variable .",
