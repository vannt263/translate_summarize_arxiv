    "there are a number of different astrophysical environments where optically thick material may be irradiated by x - rays .",
    "if the incident spectrum has significant flux above 7.1  kev , then , as a result of its relatively high cosmic abundance and large fluorescent yield , the iron  k@xmath0 line is predicted to be a significant feature in the resulting emission from the illuminated surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of this line has been discussed for a number of different reprocessors including the solar surface @xcite , the surface of the companion star in x - ray binaries @xcite , and the surface of accreting magnetic white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most famously , fe  k@xmath0  emission has been observed in the x - ray spectra of many active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and black hole candidates @xcite . here , the irradiated surface is likely the accretion disc feeding the black hole , and some of the observed fe  k@xmath0  lines have been observed to be broadened in a manner consistent with material orbiting in a relativistic gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "finally , tentative detections of line emission , most likely from fe  k@xmath0 , have been found in recent observations of the x - ray afterglows of some @xmath4-ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is confirmed then it implies that optically thick material may be in the vicinity  a possible constraint on the environment and progenitor of the burst @xcite .    as one of the few physical diagnostics in the x - ray spectra of these systems , it is important to understand how the fe  k@xmath0  emission line depends on the properties of the irradiated gas .",
    "previous studies have examined the influence of changes in metal abundance @xcite , the inclination angle of the reflector @xcite , ionization state @xcite , and the density distribution of the gas @xcite on the line emission .",
    "this paper generalizes the results of matt and colleagues by presenting how the strength of the fe  k@xmath0  line ( presented as an equivalent width [ ew ] ) depends on both the fe abundance and the ionization state of the gas .",
    "these two variables have the greatest impact on the ew , and are likely to vary widely over different astrophysical environments .",
    "we anticipate that these results will be helpful in interpreting fe  k@xmath0  detections whenever it arises from an optically thick surface .",
    "the following section details the calculations that were performed , and then section  [ sect : res ] presents the results as contour plots of ew .",
    "a brief discussion concludes the paper in section  [ sect : discuss ] .",
    "the calculations were performed using the code of @xcite .",
    "a slab with a constant hydrogen number density @xmath510@xmath6  @xmath7 was illuminated with a power - law continuum with photon - index @xmath1 ( i.e. , so that photon flux @xmath8 ) .",
    "provided that they have comparable flux above 7  kev , other incident spectral forms ( e.g. , blackbody , wien tail ) will not significantly alter the results . as a crude approximation to isotropic illumination , the penetrating radiation was assumed to strike the slab at an angle of 54.7  degrees from the normal .",
    "hydrogen and helium were assumed to be fully ionized , but c  v  vii , o  v  ix , mg  ix  xiii , si  xi  xv , and fe  xvi ",
    "xxvii were treated with abundances given by @xcite .",
    "the depth of the slab was increased as the illuminating flux was increased , and had a minimum value of 6 thomson depths and a maximum of 30 thomson depths .    when the irradiated material reached thermal and ionization equilibrium , the angle - averaged reprocessed emission from the gas was calculated .",
    "as with all photoionized gas , the reflection spectrum can be characterized by an ionization parameter : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the incident flux between 0.01 and 100  kev , the energy range of the illuminating continuum .",
    "@xmath11 was varied by changing only the value of @xmath10 .",
    "the evolution of the reflection spectrum with @xmath11 has been discussed by @xcite . here",
    "we calculate reflection spectra for @xmath126.0 while also varying the fe abundance from 0.110.1 times solar .",
    "when the illuminated gas is predominantly neutral , the fe  k@xmath0line may be affected by variations in other metals , particularly oxygen @xcite . of course , when @xmath13 all the metals other than fe are fully ionized and will have little effect on the fe emission lines .",
    "therefore , we do not consider abundance effects due to other metals , and instead refer readers to @xcite where such results are presented for neutral reflectors .",
    "the iron emission features will also depend slightly on the slope of the incident continuum ( due to the different number of ionizing photons ) , so we have performed these computations for @xmath14 , 2.0 and 2.3 to illustrate this effect .",
    "the ews were calculated by the following integral : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spectral flux of the reflected spectrum , and @xmath17 is the estimated spectral flux of the continuum at energy @xmath18 .",
    "the continuum was estimated by fitting a straight line to the reflection spectrum between 5.50 and 7.11  kev .",
    "the lower limit of the integration was chosen to take into account any compton broadening of the line profile , and the upper limit was set to the energy of the photoelectric absorption edge of neutral fe . dividing the line - flux by the monochromatic continuum at 6.4 or 6.7  kev  makes a negligible difference to the contour plots .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew - ill - nor ] shows several examples of this calculation at different @xmath11 .",
    "continuum was incident on the slab .",
    "the solid lines show the reprocessed emission and the dotted lines are the estimate to the local continuum about the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "the ew of the line is then calculated by integrating the flux above the dotted line between 5.5 and 7.1  kev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "figure  [ fig : contourplots - nor ] shows contours of constant fe  k@xmath0  ew in the @xmath19-fe abundance plane for the case where the incident power - law has not been added to the reflected spectra , as if the reflected spectrum were viewed in isolation .",
    "therefore , these ews are the _ maximum _ that can be observed as they are not diluted by the incident power - law . such reflection - dominated spectra may be observed in seyfert  2 galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  6552 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the plots show that the fe  k@xmath0  ew reaches two separate maxima in the vertical direction : one when the ionization parameter is low and the line is at 6.4  kev , and the other at @xmath20 when the line is at 6.7  kev . between these two maxima the line",
    "is suppressed due to auger destruction @xcite , and at higher @xmath11 the line weakens and disappears as all the iron becomes ionized .",
    "increasing the iron abundance does increase the fe  k@xmath0  ew , but , as is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : discuss ] , its effect is greatest when the abundance is still relatively low . nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ fig : contourplots - nor ] shows that the line can get very strong ( @xmath21  kev  in some cases ) at high fe abundance with the largest values occurring when the line is neutral . as is shown below , this is reversed when the incident power - law is added to the reflection spectrum .    as @xmath1",
    "is increased the number of fe ionizing photons decreases .",
    "this causes the contours to spread out vertically in the plot , because at a higher @xmath1 a larger flux is needed to ionize fe .",
    "when @xmath22 and @xmath23 the dependence on the fe abundance weakens and the ew grows more slowly .",
    "again , this is due to the decrease in the number of ionizing photons .    in many x - ray observations unprocessed radiation with the spectrum of the incident power - law",
    "is simultaneously detected along with the reflection spectrum .",
    "therefore , we have repeated all the ew calculations for the total power - law+reflection spectra ( agn workers think of this as a reflection fraction of unity ) .",
    "these results are shown in figure  [ fig : contourplots ] .",
    "as before , two maxima are found in the contours : one when iron is neutral and the other when the he - like fe  k@xmath0  emission line at 6.7  kevis prominent . likewise , the contours spread out vertically as the photon - index is increased",
    ". however , there are a number of differences between this set of plots and the previous one .",
    "the first one is trivial but important : the fe  k@xmath0  ews are now much smaller .",
    "the largest values are now just over 800  ev and occur when @xmath24 . at low values of @xmath11",
    "the 6.4  kev  line dominates , and the ew can not exceed 400  ev .",
    "this turn - around between the ( apparent ) strength of the neutral and ionized lines when the incident spectrum is added in is caused by the effects of absorption by other elements in the gas . when the slab is weakly illuminated much of the flux around 6  kev",
    "is absorbed by other metals in the gas , particularly oxygen , and is re - emitted as softer x - rays .",
    "this results in a large difference in flux between the incidence spectrum and the reflected spectrum at 6  kev .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath20 all the metals except for iron are almost completely ionized , so there is very little absorption around the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "thus , when the reflection and incident spectra are added together , the he - like 6.7  kev  line is more prominent than the neutral line .    to summarize , when iron abundances up to 10.1@xmath2 solar were considered , the maximum fe  k@xmath0  ew is about 8.5  kev  and is found when the gas is neutral and illuminated by @xmath14 power - law . in the case when the power - law is just simply added to the reflection spectrum ( i.e. , a reflection fraction of 1 ) , the ews are much smaller ( @xmath25  kev ) with the largest values being found when the gas is ionized and the 6.7  kev  line of he - like fe is dominant . in this case",
    ", it seems to be very difficult to obtain fe  k@xmath0  lines with ews greater than 700  ev .",
    "the results presented in the previous section showed that increasing the iron abundance would increase the fe  k@xmath0  ew , but its influence seemed to weaken as it grew .",
    "it is interesting to investigate this point since we have only considered abundances up to 10.1@xmath2 solar .",
    "is it possible to obtain an arbitrarily large ew solely by increasing the fe abundance ?",
    "the answer to this question is found in figure  [ fig : gamma2-perion ] .",
    "ew / fe abundance ) in the @xmath26-fe abundance plane .",
    "the ews were calculated using the total incident+reflected spectra and we only show the case of @xmath27 .",
    "the contour lines are at 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 , 500 , 700  ev .",
    "the effect of increasing the iron abundance is greatest when it is less than 3@xmath2 solar and when the slab is ionized.,scaledwidth=56.0% ]    this plot shows contours of fe  k@xmath0  ew normalized by the fe abundance for the case of @xmath27 and a reflection fraction of one . in this case",
    "the contours show a maximum at low fe abundance implying that the most `` power '' out of an fe atom or ion occurs when its abundance is around solar . increasing the amount of iron in the gas",
    "does permit the number of fe  k@xmath0  photons emitted to increase , but it also strengthens the line destruction mechanisms of photoabsorption and scattering .",
    "therefore , for a given flux of ionizing photons , competing atomic processes in the gas eventually decreases the efficiency of iron fluorescence .",
    "this is seen particularly when the gas is neutral : the normalized fe  k@xmath0  ew falls slowly over a wide range in fe abundance because k@xmath0 photons are destroyed by l shell absorption .    at higher values of the ionization parameter",
    ", there is a more rapid drop in the normalized fe  k@xmath0  ew .",
    "as is illustrated explicitly in figure  [ fig : line - evolution ] ,    line changes with fe abundance .",
    "total incident+reflection spectra are plotted for the three different values of @xmath1 and three representative values of @xmath11 .",
    "reflection from a slab with a 1.1 , 5.1 and 10.1@xmath2 solar fe abundance is plotted as the solid , short - dashed and long - dashed lines , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    an increase in the iron abundance from 1.1 to 5.1@xmath2 solar causes a fairly big jump in the line strength , but then only a very small change from 5.1 to 10.1@xmath2 solar . in this case , only k shell absorption is important , but due to the finite number of ionizing photons , the k edge will saturate when the fe abundance is about solar ( from fig .  [",
    "fig : gamma2-perion ] ) .",
    "increasing the fe abundance beyond this point will not greatly increase the line emission because there are few photons available to ionize the newly introduced fe atoms .",
    "of course , increasing @xmath11 allows more k shell ionizations to occur , and the normalized ew becomes more uniform with fe abundance .",
    "interestingly , the h - like fe  k@xmath0  line at 6.97  kev  which is suppressed due to resonance scattering significantly strengthens as the abundance is increased .",
    "these results illustrate that above an fe abundance of @xmath28 5@xmath2 solar there is only a very slow increase in the fe  k@xmath0ew .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that the ew of the line can be significantly increased by considering iron abundances larger than 10@xmath2 solar .",
