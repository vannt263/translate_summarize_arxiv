    "the benjamin - ono equation is a nonlinear evolution equation governing certain types of _ internal waves_. internal waves are disturbances  set into motion by gravity  of the interface between two immiscible fluids of different densities .",
    "a number of assumptions are employed to deduce the benjamin - ono equation as a simplified model from the full equations of three - dimensional fluid mechanics :    * one supposes that both fluid layers consist of inviscid and incompressible fluids , and ( for stability ) the less - dense fluid rests on top of the denser fluid .",
    "* one supposes that the waves are propagating in one direction only , which reduces the problem to that of two - dimensional fluid mechanics ( only the vertical direction and the propagation direction survive ) .",
    "* one supposes that the top layer containing the less - dense fluid is thin compared to a typical wavelength of the interface .",
    "this allows the top layer to be treated by a depth - averaging approach .",
    "the top of this layer is idealized to a rigid horizontal lid .",
    "* one supposes that the bottom layer containing the denser fluid is infinitely thick .",
    "this simplifies the contribution from this layer to the dispersion relation of small - amplitude waves on the interface in the linear approximation .",
    "* one supposes that the amplitude of the waves is small compared to the thickness of the top layer .",
    "this allows the nonlinear effects to be brought in perturbatively , and also means we are assuming the interface does not breach the surface by meeting the rigid lid .    in the linear and dispersionless approximation ,",
    "deformations of the interface satisfy the one - dimensional wave equation .",
    "if one perturbatively introduces the balanced effects of weak nonlinearity and dispersion on a solution of the wave equation propagating to the right ( say ) at constant velocity , then the benjamin - ono equation arises as the first correction in the moving frame of reference of the wave , describing the slow variation of the dimensionless wave height @xmath0 as a function of a spatial coordinate @xmath1 in the propagation direction and the time @xmath2 : @xmath3=0 .",

    "it is quite useful in applications to have accurate and easily analyzable models for internal waves . indeed , one application that is particularly timely is the modeling of submerged `` plumes '' of oil as were reported following the deepwater horizon leak in the gulf of mexico in may  august 2010 .",
    "recent experiments @xcite performed by roberto camassa and richard mclaughlin at the university of north carolina , chapel hill have demonstrated that if oil is emitted as a turbulent jet from an ocean floor leak and a density stratification is present in the surrounding fluid , then most of the oil will become trapped at the interface between the dense and less - dense fluid layers rather than floating to the surface , _ even though the oil is less dense still than the upper layer_. in these circumstances , modeling the motion of the submerged oil plumes within the fluid column amounts to modeling the motion of the density interface , that is , modeling internal waves .",
    "the purpose of this short paper is to show how methods we have recently developed @xcite to study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the benjamin - ono equation as @xmath12 in the weak topology extend both to the whole hierarchy of `` higher - order '' benjamin - ono equations and also to the whole hierarchy of densities coming from conservation laws .",

    "the proof is virtually identical to that of lemma 4.12 from @xcite .",
    "the idea is as follows . with the use of the explicit formula [ eq : gdef ] for @xmath173 one can exchange the order of integration in the formula to obtain @xmath201 where @xmath202",

    "then @xmath210 holds uniformly for @xmath211 in compact subsets of @xmath212 . recalling that @xmath162 , this means that @xmath158 converges to the alternating sum of branches of the multivalued solution of the burgers hierarchy with initial condition @xmath10 in the weak @xmath213 sense",
    "moreover , the convergence is in the strong @xmath213 sense if @xmath181 are all sufficiently small that @xmath200 is single - valued as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "now let @xmath214 be a test function .",
    "then for @xmath215 , @xmath216 holds uniformly for @xmath217 in compact subsets of @xmath212 .",

    "the distributional convergence of @xmath156 for @xmath221 clearly follows from our above results .",
    "it is also easy to conclude that holds if @xmath222 is specialized to a test function @xmath214 . to strengthen this to weak @xmath213 convergence and strong @xmath213 convergence pre - breaking ,",
    "one follows nearly verbatim the arguments on pages 254256 of @xcite .",
    "we expect that with some additional effort , the nature of the convergence of @xmath156 for @xmath221 can be strengthened to exactly the same type as is available for @xmath162 , a type of convergence that is more suitable for evaluation at a point in the phase space @xmath23 of fields .",
    "this expectation is based on the reasonable hypothesis that the weak ( or distributional ) nature of the convergence stems from the presence of wild oscillations that can be modeled by modulated @xmath199-phase wave exact solutions of the benjamin - ono hierarchy as have been described by matsuno @xcite using the bilinear method of hirota .",
    "these @xmath199-phase waves have also been obtained directly from the lax pair for ( the @xmath223 case of the hierarchy only ) by dobrokhotov and krichever @xcite , who further provided a formal whitham - type modulation theory for these waves , noting that the modulation equations simply take the form of @xmath224 copies of the inviscid burgers equation ( equation for @xmath223 ) . in light of our results",
    ", it appears that these @xmath224 copies should be globally viewed as sheets of the same multivalued solution . in any case , if one interprets the distributional limits in @xmath219 as local averages of @xmath156 over vanishingly small intervals of @xmath220 , then assuming only that the wavenumbers and frequencies are not rationally dependent , these averages could just as well be calculated over small intervals in @xmath1 , holding @xmath183 fixed .",
    "in other words , if the weak limits are necessary due to the presence of modulated multiphase waves of wavelengths and periods proportional to @xmath11 , then there should at generic points be no difference between convergence in @xmath219 and convergence in @xmath225 .",
    "a proof of such a result probably requires resolution of the microstructure as could be obtainable from an approach to the zero - dispersion limit that starts with the nonlocal riemann - hilbert problem of inverse scattering for benjamin - ono , and that involves the development of some new analogue of the deift - zhou asymptotic method as has been applied @xcite to strengthen the zero - dispersion limit of korteweg - de vries equation .",
    "we hope to be able to announce progress in this direction in the near future .",
    "it seems to us that while the benjamin - ono equation looks at first glance to be a more complicated model for wave propagation than the more famous korteweg - de vries equation due to the presence of the hilbert transform and its concomitant nonlocality ( and perhaps even at `` second glance '' , since the treatment of the benjamin - ono equation by the inverse - scattering transform method is far less well - understood than in the case of the korteweg - de vries equation ) , in fact it is far simpler in the zero - dispersion limit .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic formulae that are the analogues in the korteweg - de vries case of our limiting formulae for @xmath156 require the solution of a variational problem for a quadratic functional with constraints as was found by dave levermore and peter lax in their pioneering work @xcite , while for benjamin - ono it suffices to be able to solve the implicit algebraic equation for @xmath200 , or alternatively to solve the system of partial differential equations numerically by the method of characteristics .",
    "these are far more elementary tasks .",
    "we want to stress this point to hopefully encourage the use in the practical modeling of internal waves of the simple approximate formulae available for the benjamin - ono equation and its hierarchy when the dispersion parameter @xmath11 can be reasonably assumed to be small .",
