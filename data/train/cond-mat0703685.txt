    "magnetodielectrics can be described as materials in which magnetic ordering produces dielectric anomalies , or alternately , materials in which the low - frequency dielectric constant is sensitive to an external magnetic field.@xcite these materials have been studied for several decades , but the recent surge in activity in studying multiferroics@xcite has prompted renewed interest in understanding the origins of the spin - charge coupling in these systems . while multiferroics are also magnetodielectric , the converse is frequently not true . nevertheless , characterizing the shifts in the dielectric constant induced by magnetic ordering offers crucial insights into possible spin - charge coupling mechanisms . additionally , the recognition that substantial magnetodielectric coupling often arises in systems with non - collinear magnetic structures@xcite offers the possibility that dielectric spectroscopy may be a simple yet powerful tool for identifying phase transitions among complex magnetic structures .",
    "many magnetodielectric systems have been investigated in the past several years , including secuo@xmath0,@xcite eutio@xmath0,@xcite bimno@xmath0,@xcite cocr@xmath2o@xmath1,@xcite and tmfeo@xmath0,@xcite in addition to a very large set of studies on magnetocapacitive coupling in multiferroics.@xcite several models have been proposed for explaining the observed dependence of the low - frequency dielectric constant on spin structure and external magnetic field .",
    "the simplest of these postulates a dielectric response which varies as the square of the net magnetization.@xcite these models fail to account for the large dielectric shifts observed at antiferromagnetic transitions , which can be qualitatively understood by considering a coupling between the dielectric constant and the @xmath3-dependent spin - spin correlation function.@xcite it has recently been recognized that magnetoresistive contributions in inhomogeneous systems can also give rise to magnetocapacitive effects.@xcite    in the following , we discuss the synthesis and characterization of the magnetodielectric spinel whose structure is displayed in figure[fig : struc ] .",
    "this system has been studied previously by suzuki _",
    "et al._,@xcite who found that displays a sharp drop in the dielectric constant at the ferrimagnetic @xmath4 = 42k .",
    "this feature was attributed to the orbital degree of freedom in this system . since  is known to exhibit several complex low temperature spin states@xcite we conducted more detailed measurements of the dielectric constant at each of the magnetic transitions in order to elucidate how specific spin structures yield different magnetocapacitive couplings . at the onset of long range magnetic order in below 42k , the a - site mn@xmath5 spins order ferromagnetically along [ 010 ] , while the b - site mn@xmath6 spins order along [ 001 ] . below 39k these b - site spins order in a spiral structure with an incommensurate propagation vector along [ 010 ] and at 33k these mn@xmath6 ions",

    "well - sintered , brown pellets of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 were prepared from the oxalate mnc@xmath2o@xmath1@xmath72h@xmath2o by decomposing at 650@xmath8c for 1h , pelletizing , and heating to 1200@xmath8c for 12h following which the pellets were rapidly cooled to the room temperature .",
    "rapid cooling was required in order to avoid producing mn@xmath2o@xmath0 as an impurity phase .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns were obtained using cu - k@xmath9 radiation on a philips xpert mpd diffractometer operated at 45kv and 40ma , and subject to rietveld refinement using the xnd rietveld code.@xcite    the dc magnetization of  was measured a quantum design squid magnetometer as a function of temperature and field .",
    "we measured the specific heat and ac susceptibility using standard options on a quantum design ppms , which was also used to regulate temperature and magnetic field for dielectric measurements . for specific heat measurements ,",
    "approximately 30 mg of the powder sample was cold pressed into a solid pellet , which was found to have a small internal thermal time constant . to measure the dielectric properties",
    ", we pressed a circular pellet from approximately 50 mg of sample , then fashioned parallel plate electrodes using conducting silver epoxy .",
    "the dielectric measurements were done at an excitation frequency of 30khz with a drive of 1v .",
    "there was no significant frequency or bias dependence to the measurements .",
    "the electronic structure of mn@xmath0o@xmath1 was calculated using density functional methods . for these calculations",

    "the polycrystalline samples used in this study were monophasic as revealed by x - ray diffraction rietveld analysis shown in figure[fig : xray ] . in this structure ,",
    "mn@xmath5 ions are located at the tetrahedral site at @xmath12 , and mn@xmath6 ions at the octahedral site@xmath13 .",
    "o is at the general position @xmath14 , more structural details are provided in the caption of figure[fig : struc ] .",
    "et al.__@xcite have suggested that the @xmath15 orbital at the mn@xmath6 site is partially occupied , leading to an orbital degree of freedom .",
    "however , it is known that on cooling mn@xmath0o@xmath1 undergoes a transition from a cubic spinel to jahn - teller distorted tetragonal structure at 1433k.@xcite as a consequence of this jahn - teller structural distortion on mn@xmath6 , the electronic structure of tetragonal mn@xmath0o@xmath1 as calculated here using density functional theory , and previously using hartree - fock theory@xcite suggests no orbital degeneracy .",
    "the lmto - gga density of states calculated for collinear ferrimagnetic mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , and projected on the different mn atoms and on o are displayed in the panels of figure[fig : dos ] .",
    "the system is characterized by large exchange splitting : near 4ev on the tetrahedral a site ( occupied by mn@xmath5 ) and near 3ev on the octahedral b site ( occupied by mn@xmath6 ) . both sites are completely spin - polarized , with the crystal field configurations as indicated in the caption of the figure .",
    "the jahn - teller distortion on the octahedral b site manifests clearly in the majority spin channel , which is seen to comprise filled @xmath16 states centered around @xmath172ev , separated from a filled @xmath18 state just below @xmath19 = 0 . the empty majority @xmath20 states",
    "are found centered near 1ev .",
    "the minority mn @xmath21 states at the b site are all empty and found starting at 0ev .",
    "the crystal field splitting on the b site is of the order of 4ev .",
    "o @xmath22 states are found a little below the filled mn @xmath21 states which is not surprising given the position of mn in the middle of the first transition metal series . as would be expected for a fully spin - polarized ferrimagnet ,",
    "the calculated magnetic moment per mn@xmath0o@xmath1 formula unit is precisely 3@xmath23 corresponding to 8 spins from two octahedral mn@xmath6 ions , compensated by 5 spins from the tetrahedral mn@xmath5 ion .    in order to identify the numerous magnetic transitions in we first measured the specific heat capacity of this sample , both at zero magnetic field and under the application of a field .",
    "these results are shown in panel ( a ) of figure[fig : hcac ] .",
    "there are three distinct peaks in heat capacity at @xmath24 = 0 , corresponding to magnetic phase transitions at roughly @xmath25 = 34k , @xmath25 = 40k , and @xmath25 = 42k . approximating the lattice background to specific heat as a constant 0.5jmole@xmath26k@xmath27 over the the small temperature range of the peak",
    ", we find a total spin entropy of approximately 1.2@xmath28/. this is somewhat smaller than previously reported values,@xcite but consistent with the suggestion that substantial geometrical frustration reduces the entropy change from the full value expected for complete spin order @xmath29/. these three peaks in specific heat correspond to the development of complex spin structures investigated previously by neutron diffraction measurements.@xcite applying a magnetic field produces substantial broadening in the 42k peak , but does not significantly shift the transition temperatures , at least for fields up to @xmath24=3 t .",
    "we also see distinct features corresponding to these magnetic transitions in in ac susceptibility measurements .",
    "the imaginary component of the complex susceptibility measured at 10khz is plotted in panel ( b ) of figure[fig : hcac ] .",
    "the three peaks in the magnetic loss signal correspond to the three magnetic phase transitions observed the specific heat data . there is a substantial increase in the magnetic loss at the onset of long - range magnetic order at 42k , which remains high through the additional magnetic phase transitions at 40k and 34k .",
    "small features are also observed in the real component of the complex magnetization ( not shown ) , but these these anomalies are more difficult to discern against the large signal from the 42k transition .",
    "the upper panel of figure[fig : magn ] plots the zero - field cooled and field cooled temperature dependent dc magnetization under a measuring field of 1000oe , and the temperature dependent magnetic hysteresis loops .",
    "the transition to long - range order at 42k is clearly visible , as is a small anomaly at @xmath25 = 15k in the zfc curve , but the two additional magnetic phase transitions at @xmath25 = 34k and @xmath25 = 40k give no signal .",
    "@xmath30 loops plotted in the lower panel of figure[fig : magn ] show a net saturation magnetization corresponding to a moment of @xmath311.5 @xmath32/formula unit , with significant coercivity developing only at temperatures below 34k .",
    "the temperature dependent dielectric constant of close to these magnetic ordering transitions is shown in figure[fig : mnodielec](a ) . at zero applied magnetic field , we see a sharp decrease in the dielectric constant at 42k , coincident with the onset of long range magnetic order in .",
    "the dielectric constant decreases by approximately 0.2% , consistent with the magnitude of the drop observed previously in .@xcite in addition to the large drop in dielectric constant at 42k , we observe a much smaller , but still distinct , negative shift of 0.015% in the dielectric constant at the 34k magnetic transition .",
    "a hint of such behavior is also visible in previous studies on .@xcite while both the 42k and 34k magnetic transitions in lead to clear dielectric anomalies at zero field , there is no suggestion of any magnetodielectric coupling associated with the 40k transition .",
    "however , the application of a modest magnetic field substantially alters the dielectric response of .",
    "the negative magnetodielectric shifts associated with the 42k and 34k transitions remain relatively unchanged , but the 40k magnetic transition now produces a significant _ increase _ in dielectric constant .    in order to probe the effects of an applied magnetic field on the dielectric response of we measured the dielectric constant at fixed temperature as a function of applied field .",
    "these data are plotted in figure[fig : mnodielec](b ) . in the paramagnetic phase",
    ", there is a very slight decrease in dielectric constant with magnetic field . just below the onset of long - range magnetic order ,",
    "the shift in dielectric constant with applied field remains negative , but with a change in curvature .",
    "however , the development of the spiral magnetic structure below 40k leads to positive magnetodielectric shifts at low magnetic fields , followed by smaller decreases at higher fields .",
    "the increase in dielectric constant saturates at approximately 0.06% in a field of 3koe .",
    "we extended our measurements on the magnetic field dependence of the dielectric constant to lower temperatures , below the 34k transition .",
    "as shown in figure[fig : magn ] , develops magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures , with the coercive field reaching approximately 5koe by @xmath25 = 10k .",
    "figure[fig : lot](a ) plots the relative shift in dielectric constant as a function of _ increasing _ magnetic field , measured at fixed temperatures . at @xmath25",
    "= 30k , there is a slight asymmetry in the curve ; this asymmetry increases substantially as the temperature is reduced .",
    "we attribute this asymmetry to magnetic hysteresis in at lower temperatures .",
    "figures[fig : lot](b ) and [ fig : lot](c ) plot the change in dielectric constant relative to the minimum value , together with the square of the magnetization at @xmath25 = 15k , separately for increasing and decreasing magnetic fields .",
    "while the relative change in dielectric constant does not simply follow the square of the magnetization , the minimum dielectric constant does occur at ( approximately ) the coercive field , where @xmath33 = 0 . as we will discuss in the following",
    ", we believe the dielectric shift in is not determined by the net magnetization , but rather a more complex spin - spin correlation function for the magnetically ordered phase",
    "while both positive and negative magnetodielectric couplings have been observed previously,@xcite it is unusual for both to be present in a single system . as such , provides an important test system for understanding the mechanisms underlying magnetodielectric effects .",
    "several factors have been suggested to contribute to magnetization - induced changes in dielectric constant , including spin - phonon coupling,@xcite electronic structure,@xcite , and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite electromagnon scattering has also been proposed to explain the increase in dielectric constant observed at certain magnetic transitions in multiferroics.@xcite in the following , we concentrate mainly on discussing our experimental results in the context of possible spin - phonon coupling .",
    "it has been suggested that spin - structure induced shifts in phonon frequencies can produce changes in the dielectric constant through the lydanne - sachs - teller relation.@xcite in this framework , the optic phonon frequencies , hence dielectric constant , are coupled to the spin - spin correlation function for the magnetic structure , so the dielectric constant should vary with the neutron peak intensity .",
    "the onset of long range order in , which produces a significant drop in the dielectric constant , is associated with the growth of the ( 120 ) neutron peak intensity.@xcite we have extracted the intensity of the ( 120 ) peak from reference and plotted this as a broken line in figure[fig : mnodielec ] after correcting for a small difference in transition temperature .",
    "while the drop in dielectric constant in is somewhat steeper than the increase in neutron intensity , the dielectric shift approximately follows the intensity in the ( 120 ) peak and , in particular , both level off below 35k .",
    "while the qualitative agreement between the ( 120 ) neutron intensity and drop in the dielectric constant below 42k are consistent with the spin - phonon model for magnetodielectric coupling , the detailed mechanism remains unclear . as a first step in developing a microscopic model it is necessary to identify which specific phonon modes couple to the complex spin structure .",
    "the deformation produced by the octahedral jahn - teller mn@xmath6 ions gives rise to the tetragonal distortion to @xmath34 symmetry in .",
    "this distortion leads to 10 allowed raman active modes , @xmath35 , rather than the 5 modes in cubic spinels with @xmath36 symmetry.@xcite experimentally , only 5 raman modes are observed,@xcite including a large amplitude @xmath37 mode at 660cm@xmath26 attributed to the motion of oxygen ions inside the mno@xmath39 octahedra and associated with the cooperative jahn - teller distortion.@xcite because magnetodielectric coupling is often associated with non - collinear magnetic structures,@xcite it is tempting to postulate that the dielectric anomaly in below 42k arises because of coupling between the complex spin structure exhibited by the b site mn@xmath6 ions and vibrations of the mno@xmath39 octahedra .",
    "however , further temperature dependent raman studies are needed to look for a shift or increase in intensity of the 660cm@xmath26 peak at the 42k transition to test this suggestion .",
    "as the ( 120 ) neutron scattering intensity varies smoothly below 42k,@xcite some additional spin - phonon coupling must be responsible for the dielectric anomaly observed at 35k in zero field .",
    "below 40k , an additional neutron scattering reflection is observed at ( 1,1+@xmath40,0 ) .",
    "the propagation vector @xmath41 increases monotonically with decreasing temperature .",
    "this peak locks in at @xmath42 at the 34k magnetic transition , which also produces a sharp increase in intensity.@xcite we suppose that this low temperature magnetic structure also couples to an optic phonon mode in , giving rise to the dielectric shift observed below 34k .",
    "between 34k and 40k , @xmath40 is non - zero and temperature dependent and the magnetic structure is incommensurate with the lattice structure . the spin - phonon coupling coefficient is predicted to vary with the overlap between the @xmath3-dependent spin structure and phonon mode.@xcite the incompatibility between spin and lattice structure could lead to a varying coupling coefficient , which averages to zero and gives no net magnetodielectric coupling .",
    "only when the spin structure locks in at @xmath42 at 33k does the spin - phonon coupling constant become non - zero .",
    "we point out that incommensurate magnetic structures can lead to very dielectric anomalies associated with transitions into ferroelectrically ordered phases.@xcite this is distinctly different from our observations in , which seem to suggest that incommensurate magnetic structures do not produce sizeable dielectric anomalies .",
    "it is rather more difficult to motivate the positive shift in dielectric constant below 40k in an applied magnetic field , and positive magnetocapacitance in this temperature range ( see figure[fig : mnodielec ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that even a modest magnetic field , below 3 koe , is sufficient to lock - in some commensurate value for the propagation vector @xmath3 of the ( 110 ) structure , leading to non - zero magnetodielectric coupling . because the low temperature dielectric constant shows hysteretic effects compatible with the magnetic hysteresis curves shown in figure [ fig : magn ] , this ( 110 ) spin structure",
    "may also be expected to exhibit hysteresis .",
    "alternatively , some additional mechanism for magnetodielectric coupling beyond the spin - phonon model considered here may be relevant .",
    "additional studies of the magnetic field dependence of the dielectric constant on single crystal samples may be required to clarify the origins of the positive magnetocapacitance observed between 34k and 40k at low fields .    in summary , we have investigated the dielectric properties of in detail and found evidence for magnetodielectric coupling associated with specific magnetic structures .",
    "an incommensurate magnetic transition in produces no dielectric anomaly at zero magnetic field , but applying modest fields produces an increase in dielectric constant at this transition .",
    "these magnetodielectric features can be qualitatively understood using a spin - phonon coupling model , although a more detailed understanding of the specific phonons involved in the coupling would be necessary to compare theory and experiment in detail .",
