    "the well - known @xmath0 family of description logics ( dls ) with a concrete domain @xcite originated from a pure dl known as @xmath9 @xcite , with @xmath10 roles all of which are general , not necessarily functional relations .",
    "it is obtained by adding to @xmath9 functional roles ( better known as abstract features ) , a concrete domain @xmath11 , and concrete features ( which refer to objects of the concrete domain ) .",
    "consider now the family of domain - specific spatio - temporal ( henceforth @xmath12 ) languages , obtained by spatio - temporalising @xmath0 in the following way :    1 .",
    "temporalisation of the roles , so that they consist of @xmath13 immediate - successor ( accessibility ) relations @xmath14 , of which the @xmath15 s are general , not necessarily functional relations , and the @xmath16 s functional relations ; and 2 .",
    "spatialisation of the concrete domain @xmath11 : the spatialisation is @xmath17 , generated by a spatial relation algebra ( ra ) @xmath18 , such as the region - connection calculus rcc8 @xcite .    the resulting family , together with what we will refer to as weakly cyclic tboxes , enhances the expressiveness of modal temporal logics with qualitative spatial constraints , and consists of qualitative theories for ( relational ) spatial change and propositional change in general , and for motion of spatial scenes in particular .",
    "in particular , satisfiability of a concept with respect to ( @xmath19 ) a weakly cyclic tbox is decidable .",
    "an interpretation of a member of such a spatio - temporal family is a ( labelled ) tree - like structure .",
    "a snapshot of such a structure ( i.e. , the label of a node ) describes a static situation , splitting into a propositional ( sub-)situation , given by the set of atomic propositions true at that node , and a ( relational ) spatial ( sub-)situation , given by a consistent conjunction of qualitative spatial relations on tuples of concrete features ( the qualitative spatial relations are predicates of the concrete domain ) .",
    "real applications , however , such as high - level vision , @xmath20 documents , or what is known as spatial aggregation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , have a huge demand in the representation of dynamic structured data .",
    "such structured data may consist of descriptions of complex objects , or of classes of objects , such as , e.g. , a complex table setting for a meal , a tree - like description of a complex @xmath20 document , or a complex spatial aggregate .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the dl @xmath9 @xcite augmented with abstract features .",
    "@xmath21 is particularly important for the representation of static structured data , thanks , among other things , to its abstract features , which allow it to access specific paths .",
    "@xmath21 is a sublanguage of @xmath0 , making the latter also suitable for the representation of static structured data .",
    "@xmath21 , however , contrary to @xmath0 , does not allow for the representation of domain - specific knowledge , which can be seen as constraints on objects of the domain of interest , and which @xmath0 is very good at , thanks to its concrete domain .",
    "the roles in @xmath0 are interpreted in the same way as inheritance relations in semantic networks ; in particular , they are given no tenporal interpretation .",
    "the concrete domain is just an abstract constraint language ; in particular the universe of instantiation values is given no spatial interpretation : if a constraint on @xmath22 and @xmath23 is seen as a binary boolean matrix then value @xmath24 in entry @xmath25 means that assigning the @xmath26-th value of the universe to @xmath22 matches with assigning the @xmath27-th value to @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , the constraint does not say anything about how the arguments relate , say , spatially to each other , which would be different if the relations were , say , @xmath8 relations ( and the universe of instantiation values , regions of a topological space ) . as such , @xmath0 describes structured static data , with the possibility of expressing domain specific constraints , thanks to its concrete domain .",
    "we denote the @xmath0 spatio - temporalisation referred to above as @xmath28 ( modal temporal @xmath9 with a concrete domain generated by spatial ra @xmath18 ) .",
    "the roles are now given a temporal interpretation , and they consist of immediate - successor relations ( functional relations in the case of abstract features , and general relations in the case of non - functional roles ) ; they can be seen as actions in the possible - worlds semantics of the situation calculus ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the extension of @xmath0 we will be considering in this work is indeed a cross product of the spatio - temporalisation @xmath28 , on the one hand , and @xmath0 itself , on the other hand .",
    "it will be referred to as @xmath29 .",

    "are also associated the concrete features appearing in @xmath227 : such a concrete feature , @xmath3 , is mapped at each node of @xmath167 , to a ( concrete ) object of the spatial domain in consideration ( e.g. , a region of a topological space if the concrete domain is generated by @xmath8 ) .",
    "the feature chains are of the form @xmath246 , with @xmath247 , where the @xmath16 s are abstract features ( also known , as alluded to before , as functional roles : functions from the abstract domain onto the abstract domain ) , whereas @xmath3 is a concrete feature ( a function from the abstract domain onto the set of objects of the concrete domain ) .",
    "the sets @xmath34 are used to label the nodes of the search space .",
    "informally , a run of the search space is a subspace , obtained by selecting at each node , labelled , say , with @xmath34 , one element of @xmath248 .",

    "the concept @xmath251 gives birth to new nodes of the run , @xmath254 ; to new variables of what could be called the ( global ) csp , @xmath255 , of @xmath249 ; and to a new constraint of @xmath255 .",

    "then whenever a new node @xmath196 is added to the search space , the global @xmath263 of the run being constructed is updated , by augmenting it with ( the variables and ) the constraints generated , as described above , by @xmath196 . once the @xmath263 has been updated , so that it includes the local @xmath263 at the current node , the local consisteny pruning is applied by propagating the constraints in @xmath266 . once a run has been fully constructed , and only then , its global @xmath263 is solved . in the case of a concrete domain generated by a binary , @xmath8-like ra ,",
    "the filtering is achieved with a path - consisteny algorithm @xcite , and the solving of the global @xmath263 , after a run has been fully constructed , with a solution search algorithm such as the one in @xcite . in the case of a concrete domain generated by a ternary spatial ra",
    ", the filtering and the solving processes are achieved with a strong 4-consistency and a search algorithms such as the ones in @xcite .",
    "we have provided a rich spatio - temporal framework combining a spatio - temporalisation of the well - know @xmath0 family of description logics with a concrete domain @xcite , with @xmath0 itself .",
    "the famework is well - suited for the representation of change in dynamic structured data , in dynamic spatial scenes , and in dynamic propositional knowledge .",
    "contrary to most existing approaches of combining modal or description logics to get spatio - temporal languages ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , ours leads to a decidable language .",
    "this advantage of being expressively rich while remaining decidable is the fruit of the way the combination is done , which is complex enough to make the resulting framework rich , but keeps a separation between the ( decidable ) combined languages large enough to bring decidability of the resulting language into decidability of the combined ones .",
