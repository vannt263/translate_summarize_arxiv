    "the observation of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) with energy higher than 10@xmath1 ev has attracted the attention of the astrophysics and particle - physics community on the most energetic phenomena taking place in the universe .",
    "it is supposed that such energetic particles are accelerated in extra - galactic sources .",
    "gamma ray sources with energy up to tens of tev have also been observed .",
    "if high energy photons are generated through the production and decay of neutral pions , it is reasonable to expect , from the same sources , an associated flux of high energy neutrinos , generated through the production and decay of charged pions .",
    "along their journey in the universe , most part of the electromagnetic and hadronic emission is deflected or absorbed by the electromagnetic background and by the intergalactic and interstellar matter .",
    "neutrinos , on the contrary , are not significantly absorbed by the intergalactic medium and are not deflected by the intergalactic magnetic fields . already in 1960",
    "markov @xcite proposed to use seawater as a huge target to detect uhe neutrinos , looking at their charged current weak interactions .",
    "the outgoing lepton generates , along its path in seawater , erenkov light that can be detected by a lattice of optical sensors .",
    "the reconstruction of the muon track , and thus of the neutrino direction , offers the possibility to identify the neutrino sources opening the new exciting field of neutrino astronomy .",
    "the observation of high energy neutrino fluxes expected from astrophysical sources requires a detector with an effective area close to 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 instrumented along a distance comparable to the range in water ( @xmath4 km ) of the high energy muons ( @xmath4 1000 tev ) .",
    "the identified neutrino sources identified could be catalogued in the sky map and eventually compared with the known gamma sources .",
    "the construction of a detector of such dimensions , usually called a km@xmath5 neutrino telescope , is one of the main challenges of astroparticle physics today .",
    "the mediterranean sea offers optimal conditions , on a worldwide scale , to locate an underwater neutrino telescope .",
    "the choice of the km@xmath5 scale neutrino telescope location is such an important task that careful studies of candidate sites must be carried out in order to identify the most suitable one . along the italian coasts",
    "several sites exist , at depth @xmath6 m , that are potentially interesting to host an undersea neutrino telescope . in these sites",
    "we have studied deep seawater optical properties ( absorption and attenuation ) and environmental properties : water temperature and salinity , biological activity , water currents , sedimentation . in this paper",
    "we report light transmission measurements carried out in two sites named _ ustica _ ( during november 1999 ) and _ alicudi _ ( on december 1999 ) , in the southern tyrrhenian sea , located at :    * * @xmath7 n @xmath8 e * , north - est of ustica island ; * * @xmath7 n @xmath9 e * , north of alicudi island .",
    "water transparency to electromagnetic radiation can be characterized by means of quantitative parameters : the absorption length @xmath10 and the scattering length @xmath11 .",
    "each length represents the path after which a photon beam of intensity @xmath12 at wavelength @xmath13 , travelling along the emission direction , is reduced to @xmath14 by absorption or diffusion phenomena .",
    "these quantities can be directly derived by the simple relation :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the optical path traversed by the beam and @xmath12 the source intensity . in literature absorption ( @xmath17 ) and scattering ( @xmath18 ) coefficients are extensively used to characterize the light transmission in matter as well as the attenuation coefficient ( @xmath19 ) defined as :    @xmath20    the main cause of light absorption in water is excitation of vibrational states of the water molecule by photons @xcite : due to such process the photon energy is entirely deposited in the traversed medium . scattering refers to processes in which the direction of the photon is changed without any other alteration . scattering phenomena",
    "in which the photon wavelength changes ( e.g. raman effect ) happen less frequently .",
    "scattering can take place either on molecules ( rayleigh scattering ) or on dissolved particulate ( mie scattering ) .    in pure water , light absorption and scattering",
    "are strongly wavelength dependent .",
    "in particular light transmission in pure water is extremely favored in the range 350 @xmath21 550 nm , overlapping the region in which pmts usually reach the highest quantum efficiency . in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum light absorption",
    "steeply decreases as a function of wavelength and reaches its minimum at about 420 nm ( see figure [ fig : waterspectrumduntley ] ) .",
    "this is the reason why seawater has a blue - green color .",
    "[ fig : waterspectrumduntley ]        the optical properties of natural seawater are functions of water salinity , water temperature and of the concentration of dissolved organic and inorganic matter .",
    "light absorption and diffusion in water as a function of salinity and temperature have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that , for @xmath22 nm , the dependence of scattering coefficient on temperature and salinity is negligible while the variation of the absorption coefficient is significant , in particular at @xmath23 nm ( for details see  [ sec : dataanalysis ] ) .",
    "the seawater diffusion and absorption coefficients can be parameterized as the sum of a term due to optically pure water ( i.e. water without dissolved particulate ) at defined conditions of temperature and salinity ( @xmath24 ) , and a term that accounts for interaction of light with particulate ( @xmath25 ) :    @xmath26    @xmath27    optical measurements of deep seawater have shown that the presence of particulate has a negligible effect on light absorption but it enlarges the light diffusion coefficient . since water temperature and salinity and particulate concentration may vary significantly in different marine sites",
    "it is extremely important to measure optical parameters _ in situ_.",
    "we performed attenuation and absorption measurements of light in deep seawater by means of a set - up based on a trasmissometer : the _ ac9 _ manufactured by _",
    "wetlabs _ @xcite . the device compactness ( 68 cm height @xmath28 10.2 cm diameter ) and its pressure resistance ( it can operate down to 6000 m depth )",
    "are excellent for our purposes .",
    "the _ ac9 _ performs attenuation and absorption measurements independently using two different light paths and spanning the light spectrum over nine different wavelengths ( 412 , 440 , 488 , 510 , 532 , 555 , 650 , 676 , 715 nm ) . in our measurements",
    "we obtain an accuracy in @xmath29 and @xmath30 of about @xmath31 m@xmath32 .",
    "the _ ac9 _ attenuation and absorption measurement technique is based on the lambert s law of collimated beams ( see equation [ eq : lambertlaw ] ) where @xmath16 is the beam path - length , @xmath33 is the intensity of the collimated primary beam , at a given wavelength @xmath13 , and @xmath34 is the beam intensity measured at distance @xmath16 , as a result of absorption or attenuation effect respectively .    in order to produce collimated monochromatic light beams ,",
    "the instrument is equipped with an incandescence lamp and a set of collimators and nine monochromatic ( @xmath35 10 nm ) filters .",
    "two different beams are available at the same time for independent measurements of attenuation and absorption .",
    "each beam is split in two parts by a mirror : the reflected one reaches a reference silicon photon detector .",
    "the refracted one crosses a quartz window and enters inside a 25 cm long pipe . during deep sea measurements",
    "seawater fills the pipes ( _ flow tubes _ ) .",
    "the flow tube used for attenuation measurements has a black inner surface in order to absorb all photons scattered by seawater . a collimated silicon photon detector ( angular acceptance @xmath36 ) is placed at the end of the path , along the source axis .",
    "thanks to this strongly collimated layout the end - path detector receives only photons which have not interacted ( neither absorbed nor scattered ) .",
    "the reference detector measures the source intensity @xmath37 , the end - path detector measures the attenuated beam intensity @xmath38 , @xmath16 is the known beam path in water ( 0.25 m ) .",
    "the attenuation coefficient is therefore calculated as :    @xmath39    in the absorption channel , the inner surface of the _ absorption flow tube _ behaves like a cylindrical mirror .",
    "the light scattered by seawater is reflected and redirected towards a wide angular acceptance silicon photon detector . in first approximation all scattered photons are detected and the ratio between the intensities @xmath37 and @xmath40 is only a function of the seawater absorption coefficient @xmath29 .    using _",
    "data , the scattering coefficient can be calculated by subtracting the absorption value from the attenuation value at each given wavelength ( see equation [ eq : attenuation ] ) .",
    "in the interval of wavelength interesting for a erenkov neutrino telescope , @xmath41 nm , the expected values of absorption and attenuation coefficients in deep seawater are @xmath42 m@xmath32 , very close to the pure water ones .",
    "this implies that the instrument should have sensitivity and accuracy of the order of @xmath43 m@xmath32 .",
    "the calibration of the instrument plays the most important role in determining the accuracy in measurements . in the above defined wavelength range",
    ", pure water optical properties have been extensively measured , therefore pure water can be assumed as a reference medium @xcite .",
    "instrumental effects - such as the status of optical windows , of the electronics , etc.- can also be studied filling the flow tubes with a medium with a negligible light absorption and attenuation ( e.g. dry air or @xmath44 ) .",
    "the instrument calibration can be , thus , performed and tested any time filling the flow tubes with a medium with known optical properties : either pure water ( _ pure water calibration _ ) or @xmath44 ( _ air calibration _ ) . filling the flow tubes with pure water we measure , for example in the absorption channel , the values :    @xmath45    and , in the case of @xmath44 ,    @xmath46    the extra - term @xmath47 takes into account the light absorption in the instrument optics ( that is function of the status of quartz windows and mirror surfaces ) and all other instrumental effects ( see  [ sec : dataanalysis ] ) .",
    "this means that this term can vary with time and can be a function of the internal electronics temperature .",
    "the same argument is valid for the attenuation channel .    with pure water inside the flow tubes the measurement of _",
    "ac9 _ can be set equal to the known values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the result of the _ water calibration _",
    "procedure is a set of 18 calibration constants ( for the nine absorption and attenuation channels ) that represent the working status of _ ac9_. the _ ac9 _ internal software subtracts these coefficients to the actual reading of the instrument such that each ac9 output value , when reference water fills the flow tubes , should be equal to zero .    filling the flow - tubes with sea water we measure :    @xmath50    @xmath51",
    "then the values of ac9 output corresponding to the case of deep sea water filling the flow tubes are :    @xmath52    @xmath53",
    "the _ ac9 _ manufacturer ( _ wetlabs _ ) provides the instrument calibration performed with de - ionized and de - gassed pure water , at given temperature ( @xmath54c ) , as referenced in @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of this medium , at the nine wavelengths relevant for the _ ac9 _ , are listed in table [ tab : purewater ] .",
    "_ wetlabs _ provides also the results of the instrument calibration performed with dry air .",

    "the systematic errors , mainly due to the accuracy of the calibration check procedure , have been evaluated to be equal to @xmath58 .",

    "the importance of measuring seawater optical properties _ in situ _ has been discussed by several authors . the set - up we used permits to evaluate seawater light absorption and attenuation coefficient as a function of depth and wavelength ( in the range @xmath62 nm ) .",

    "the values of @xmath63 measured in the depth interval of interest in _ alicudi _ and _ ustica _ are very close to the ones reported by smith and baker as _ pure seawater _ absorption @xcite . the discrepancy is less than @xmath64 m@xmath32 at all wavelengths , except at 715 nm where the temperature effect is relevant .",
    "average absorption length for blue light ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 nm ) is @xmath67 m ; the average attenuation length is @xmath68 m. these values are extremely good when compared to published seawater attenuation values obtained in conditions of collimated beam and detector geometry @xcite .",
    "the measured blue light attenuation length value is very close to the ones measured by khanaev and kuleshov @xcite in the nestor site @xcite .    on the contrary , our results",
