    "a central topic of contemporaneous astrobiology is the study of habitability around different types of stars , particularly main - sequence stars .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that stars spent most of their lifetimes on the main - sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , it is noteworthy that the distribution of stellar spectral types is strongly tilted toward low - mass stars , i.e. , k and m - type stars , as implied by detailed determinations of the initial mass function in the solar neighborhood and beyond ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the present study we want to consider stars of large abundance in the galactic disk , within a reasonably large mass range , and which all have the potential of being central objects to habitable planetary systems .",
    "thus , it is the aim of the present paper to significantly augment our previous study that dealt with the evolution of circumstellar habitability for stars akin to the sun ( @xmath3 ) , see @xcite , by considering stars with masses between 0.5 and 2.0  @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we will adopt a wider grid of planetary masses , ecompassing 1 to 10 earth masses ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite in paper  i presented a detailed thermal evolution model for a 10 earth - mass planet in the environment of a star like the sun while also adopting an up - to - date solar evolutionary model @xcite .",
    "the planetary model of habitability has been based on the integrated system approach , which describes the photosynthetic biomass production taking into account a variety of climatological , biogeochemical , and geodynamical processes .",
    "this allowed us to identify a so - called photosynthesis - sustaining habitable zone ( phz ) determined by the limits of biological productivity on the planetary surface .",
    "the model also considered the principle possibility of habitability during stellar evolution along the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "it was found that the solar phz increases in width over time and moves outward , as expected .",
    "for example , for ages of 11.0 , 11.5 , 12.0 , and 12.1 gyr , the phz is found to extend from 1.41 to 2.60 , 1.58 to 2.60 , 4.03 to 6.03 , and 6.35 to 9.35 au , respectively .",
    "the approach of evaluating habitability based on assessing the phz is alternative to the study of the climatological habitable zone used by @xcite and others .",
    "note that concerning earth - mass planets , a detailed study of geodynamic habitability based on the phz was previously presented by @xcite .",
    "they found that earth will be rendered uninhabitable after 6.5  gyr as a result of plate tectonics , notably the growth of the continental area ( enhanced loss of atmospheric co@xmath4 by the increased weathering surface ) and the dwindling spreading rate ( diminishing co@xmath4 output from the solid earth ) .",
    "this work already considered systems of different types of main - sequence stars ; however , it was based on an earlier version of stellar evolution models given by @xcite .",
    "moreover , it also did not include stellar post  main - sequence evolution .",
    "the study by @xcite implies that there is no merit in investigating the future habitability of earth during long - term stellar evolution , as in the framework of phz models , the lifetime of habitability is limited by terrestrial geodynamic processes .",
    "however , this situation is expected to be significantly different for super - earth planets due to inherent differences compared to earth - mass planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a further motivation for this type of work stems from the ongoing discovery of super - earths in the solar neighborhood with the gliese 876 @xcite and gliese 581 @xcite systems as prime examples . in the following ,",
    "we describe aspects of stellar evolutionary processes pertaining to our study .",
    "next , we discuss the definition of the photosynthesis - sustaining habitable zone , including the relevant geodynamic assumptions .",
    "thereafter , we present our results and discussion . finally , we convey our summary and conclusions .",
    "as in paper  i , we base the selected evolution models on the well - tested eggleton code , which allows us to follow the changes of stellar properties through the stages of the main - sequence , the red giant branch , and beyond .",
    "our computations have been made with an advanced version of the eggleton code , which considers updated opacities and an improved equation of state as described by @xcite .",
    "for the abundance of heavy elements , which decisively affect the opacities , we use the near - solar value of @xmath5 .",
    "this choice is an appropriate representation of present - day samples of stars in the thin galactic disk , noting that these stars show a relatively narrow distribution ( @xmath6 to 0.03 ) regarding heavy element abundances about this value . besides other desirable characteristics",
    ", the adopted evolution code uses a self - adapting mesh and has a treatment of  overshooting \" that has thoroughly been tested .",
    "its two parameters , i.e. , the mixing length and the overshoot length , have been calibrated by utilizing giant and supergiant stars in well - studied , eclipsing binary systems @xcite .",
    "the evolution code , as used by us , also considers a detailed description of the stellar mass loss , including its impact on the evolution during the stages of giant star evolution following @xcite .",
    "the treatment of the stellar mass loss rate as function of the governing stellar parameters has successfully been tested on globular clusters as well as for a set of well studied stars @xcite .",
    "thus , the attained models of stellar evolution are expected to provide an accurate description of the time - dependent behavior of stellar luminosity ( see fig .  1 ) , as well as other stellar quantities , from the main - sequence to the rgb stage , for the entire range of masses considered in our study .",
    "also note that as a consequence of the steadily increasing mass loss , particularly on the upper rgb of various stars including the sun , the orbital distance @xmath7 of any putative planet increases as @xmath8 with @xmath9 as stellar mass , owing to the conservation of the orbital angular momentum of the planet .      in table  1 , we present some characteristics of stellar evolution models for the mass range of 0.5 to 2 @xmath2 . for comparison , we note that the solar age , according to our models , is given as 4.58 gyr , see @xcite ( for a metallicity of @xmath10 = 0.018 ) , and the sun s present - day effective temperature is identified as @xmath11  k. masses below 0.5 @xmath2 , i.e. , most m - type stars , have been omitted from our study .",
    "their stellar evolution can be neglected , luminosity and stellar temperature remain unchanged .",
    "moreover , stars of relatively large masses , i.e. , @xmath12 are also considered poor candidates for supporting life because the stellar lifetimes are almost certainly too short to permit the onset of biology . in table  1",
    ", we list information on the target stars taken into consideration .",
    "particularly , we convey the time for each stellar model at which the initial ( i.e. , zero - age main - sequence ) luminosity @xmath13 has increased by 50% , and when @xmath13 has doubled .",
    "stars above @xmath14 reach the stage at which they leave the main - sequence phase after less than a billion years .",
    "if we set a relatively low age limit of , say , 300 million years as a requirement for the development of complex life forms during the phase of slowly increasing stellar luminosity , we would limit the mass range of potential host stars of life - bearing planets to a maximum of about @xmath15 .    in table  1 , we also list the stellar effective temperatures , which are a steep monotonic function of the stellar mass .",
    "note that due to the appearance of increased photospheric uv fluxes , relatively high effective temperatures by themselves represent an adverse factor for the general possibility of advanced life forms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is particularly relevant for stars of spectral type mid - f and earlier , although the biological impact of stellar uv environments is typically significantly altered by the attenuation of planetary atmospheres .",
    "this consideration is a further motivation to disregard stars with masses beyond 1.5 or @xmath16 ( i.e. , early f stars ) in the context of exobiology . towards the low mass limit at about @xmath17 , there are virtually no stellar evolutionary changes for these stars while being on the main - sequence owing to the current age of the universe .",
    "however , regarding m - type stars , adverse influences on the origin and development of sophisticated life forms also exist , particularly associated with strong uv , euv and x - ray flaring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "close to about one solar mass , we find an interesting result : stars of , e.g. , @xmath18 , still spend many billion years in increasing their luminosity from 1.5 times to 2 times of their zero - age main - sequence luminosity . in that phase , which is sufficiently stable and long - lived to provide the development of life forms , the initially significantly cooler effective temperature of such",
    "a star is closing in on that of the early sun .",
    "this change of quality and quantity of the host star radiation could `` unfreeze '' a planet , which was initially outside the habitable zone , and still leave it with enough time to develop complex life forms .",
    "when reaching about 1.5 times their zero - age main - sequence luminosity , stars of 0.9 solar masses have reached an age of about 8 billion years ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , much like the older stars of the thin galactic disk .",
    "hence , several such cases should be found in present - day stellar samples of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we also note that these same stars continue to evolve quite slowly .",
    "it will take them several further billions of years to leave the main - sequence and to advance on the rgb .",
    "as previously pointed out , the most promising types of stars for hosting life - bearing planets regarding our grid of models are those of 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 ( sun ) , 1.2 and @xmath19 .",
    "all these stars have a lot in common : they all evolve into red giants ( rgb phase ) after central hydrogen burning has ceased .",
    "the expansion of the outer layers of a rgb star is driven by two related processes : the contraction of the inner helium core , which has lost its stabilising energy production , and the growing energy production by the hydrogen burning shell around it .",
    "this layer right above the contracting core experiences a steady density increase , which drives up the resulting stellar luminosity .",
    "the now much higher energy output of the hydrogen burning shell as well as the much higher density of the core region lead to a very expanded outer stellar structure , associated with a significant increase in stellar luminosity and radius ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . additionally ,",
    "the stellar structure is shaped by the onset of a cool wind , associated with significant mass loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for our models of 1.0 , 1.2 and 1.5 @xmath1 , the appearance of a helium flash marks the end of the rgb phase , as the stars settle into a new equilibrium with a much less compact core ( due to its new source of energy ) and a , consequently , much less expanded outer structure",
    ". however , the post - rgb stellar evolution does not offer any promising aspects for the origin of life , since the relatively stable phase of central helium burning lasts only a few hundred million years .",
    "furthermore , any ancient life forms on previously habitable worlds will most likely be destroyed , since in the extreme rgb phases of those stars amount to 200 - 300 times its initial size and several thousand times its initial luminosity .",
    "this entails a complete nullification of previous zones of circumstellar habitability established during stellar main - sequence evolution .",
    "however , despite such remarkable homogeneity concerning their main physical processes , stars in the range of 0.8 to 1.5 solar masses differ largely in their lifetimes ; see fig .  2 and table  1 for details .",
    "on the upper rgb , the much longer times spent in that phase by low - mass stars have an interesting consequence : their mass loss experienced in this phase amounts to more than @xmath20 .",
    "this has dramatic implications for any existing planets at his stages noting that their orbital distance @xmath7 increases as @xmath8 .",
    "this may imply that an at that time habitable planet may permanently leave the stellar habitable zone or , conversely , an inhabitable planet may enter the stellar habitable zone , and becomes  unfrozen \" ; see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for previous results for stars akin to the sun .    in summary",
    ", it is the stellar main - sequence phase that is most relevant for the evolution of life on planets at a suitable distance .",
    "the slower the star increases its luminosity , the longer a planet stays within the slowly expanding habitable zone .",
    "thus , all stars between 0.9 and @xmath21 masses are potential host stars for life from the beginning of stellar evolution . stars between 0.8 and 0.9 solar masses show an even slower change in stellar effective temperature and luminosity ; in fact , they reach solar luminosity after 8 billion years . detailed studies for the evolution of habitability , based on the definition of the climatological habitable zones ( see below ) , during stellar lifetimes were given by @xcite and others .",
    "@xcite applied this framework to known exoplanetary systems to evaluate the possibility of habitable  earths \" .",
    "stellar evolutionary aspects are also relevant to the future of life on earth , as discussed by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , although the impact of geodynamic processes appears to be dominant for setting the time limit of terrestrial habitability @xcite .",
    "customary simulations about the role of stellar evolution on circumstellar habitability typically invoke the framework of the climatic habitable zone @xcite . in this type of models , the zone of habitability at a given evolutionary time for a star with luminosity @xmath22 and",
    "effective temperature @xmath23 can be calculated following @xcite as @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 described as second order polynomials .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to expand the focus of paper  i , which is solely focused on the sun .",
    "paper  i is based on the concept that the habitability of super - earth planets is evaluated via a modified earth - system model that describes the evolution of the temperature and atmospheric co@xmath4 concentration . on earth , the carbonate ",
    "silicate cycle is the crucial element for a long - term homeostasis under increasing solar luminosity . on geological time - scales ,",
    "the deeper parts of the earth are considerable sinks and sources of carbon .",
    "our numerical model was previously applied to the super - earths gl  581c and gl  581d @xcite , the putative super - earth gl  581 g @xcite as well as fictitious earth - mass planets for 47  uma and 55  cnc @xcite , among numerous other studies .",
    "this model couples the stellar luminosity @xmath22 , the silicate  rock weathering rate @xmath27 and the global energy balance to obtain estimates of the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide @xmath28 , the mean global surface temperature @xmath29 , and the biological productivity @xmath30 as a function of time @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ boxmodel ] ) .",
    "the main point is the persistent balance between the co@xmath4 sink in the atmosphere  ocean system and the metamorphic ( plate tectonic ) sources .",
    "this is expressed through the dimensionless quantities @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the weathering rate , @xmath34 is the continental area , and @xmath35 is the areal spreading rate , which are all normalized by their present values of earth .",
    "( [ gfr ] ) can be rearranged by introducing the geophysical forcing ratio gfr @xcite as @xmath36 here we assume that the weathering rate only depends on the global surface temperature and the atmospheric co@xmath4 concentration .",
    "for the investigation of a super - earth under external forcing , we adopt a model planet with a prescribed continental area .",
    "the fraction of continental area with respect to the total planetary surface @xmath37 is varied between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the connection between the stellar parameters and the planetary climate can be obtained by using a radiation balance equation @xcite @xmath40   = 4i_r ( t_{\\mathrm{surf } } , p_{\\mathrm{co}_2 } ) , \\label{l}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the planetary albedo , @xmath42 the outgoing infrared flux , and @xmath7 the distance from the central star .",

    "the key equations used in our present study are in accord with our previous work focused on gl  581c , gl  581d , and gl  581 g ; see @xcite for details .",
    "a key element is the computation of the areal spreading rate @xmath53 ; note that @xmath53 is a function of the average mantle temperature @xmath54 , the surface temperature @xmath29 , the heat flow from the mantle @xmath55 , and the area of ocean basins @xmath56 @xcite .",

    ", we assume that a more massive planet is likely to convect in a plate tectonic regime similar to earth .",
    "thus , the more massive the planet , the higher the rayleigh number that controls convection , the thinner the top boundary layer ( lithosphere ) , and the higher the convective velocities .",
    "we recognize that there is an ongoing debate about the onset and significance of plate tectonics on super - earth planets .",
    "on one hand , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that there might be in an episodic or stagnant lid regime , considering that increasing the planetary radius acts to decrease the ratio of driving to resisting stresses , an effect that appears to be robust when increases in planetary gravity are included .",

    "* ) operate as well . on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite argued that planet tectonics of super - earths should be considered inevitable .",
    "their models show that as the planetary mass increases , the shear stress to overcome resistence to plate thickness increases while the plate thickness decreases , thereby enhancing plate weakness .",
    "these effects contribute favorably to the subduction of the lithosphere ( like on earth ) , a crucial component of plate tectonics . noting that in the framework of our model , a plate - tectonic - driven carbon cycle is considered necessary and essential for carbon - based life",

    "<S> in a previous study published in _ astrobiology _ , we focused on the evolution of habitability of a 10  @xmath0 super - earth planet orbiting a star akin to the sun . </S>",
    "<S> this study was based on a concept of planetary habitability in accordance to the integrated system approach that describes the photosynthetic biomass production taking into account a variety of climatological , biogeochemical , and geodynamical processes . in the present study </S>",
    "<S> , we pursue a significant augmentation of our previous work by considering stars with zero - age main sequence masses between 0.5 and 2.0  @xmath1 with special emphasis on models of 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.2 and 1.5  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our models of habitability consider again geodynamical processes during the main - sequence stage of these stars as well as during their red giant branch evolution . </S>",
    "<S> pertaining to the different types of stars , we identify so - called photosynthesis - sustaining habitable zones ( phz ) determined by the limits of biological productivity on the planetary surface . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain various sets of solutions consistent with the principal possibility of life . considering that stars of relatively high masses depart from the main - sequence much earlier than low - mass stars </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the biospheric life - span of super - earth planets of stars with masses above approximately 1.5  @xmath2 is always limited by the increase in stellar luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> however , for stars with masses below 0.9  @xmath2 , the life - span of super - earths is solely determined by the geodynamic time - scale . for central star masses between 0.9 and 1.5  @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of life in the framework of our models depends on the relative continental area of the super - earth planet . </S>"
