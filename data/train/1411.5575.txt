    ", three sakharov criteria  @xcite must be satisfied in the early universe : ( 1 ) baryon number violation ; ( 2 ) c and cp violation ; ( 3 ) a departure from the thermal equilibrium ( assuming exact cpt invariance ) .",
    "these requirements are realizable , though doing so requires physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . to that end",

    "neither requirement is satisfied in the sm .",
    "one simple extension of the sm that may allow them to be satisfied is the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) ( for a recent review , see ref .",

    "the light stop scenario is necessary for successful baryogenesis .",
    "but the higgs mass discovered by the cern lhc  @xcite as well as higgs decay rates put strong constraint on the parameter space of the light stop , which allows one to exclude the ewbg in the mssm at quite high confidence level  @xcite .",
    "possible ways out are considering extensions of the mssm , of which the next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite is attractive since it provides solution to the @xmath7 problem and naturally accommodates a @xmath8 sm higgs .",
