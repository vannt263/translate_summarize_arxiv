    "much of plasma physics and astrophysics could manage with simple extensions of hydrogenic models , thomas - fermi theory , extended - debye theory , and classical ` one - component - plasma ' models as long as the accuracy of observations , experiments and theoretical models did not demand anything more from quantum mechanics . on the other hand , at the level of foundations of quantum mechanics , the whole issue of a quantized thermo - field dynamics",

    "similarly , the theory of ` mixed ' systems with classical and quantum components is also a topic of discussion  @xcite .",
    "it is in this context that we need to look at the advent of density - functional theory ( dft ) as a great step forward in the quantum many - body problem .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorem published in 1964 was soon followed by its finite-@xmath5 generalization by mermin , providing a ` thermal ' density - functional theory ( th - dft ) in 1965  @xcite , which also saw the advent of kohn - sham theory .",
    "hence in 2015 we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of both kohn - sham theory , and mermin s extension of hohenberg - kohn theory to finite-@xmath5 .    while dft provided chemistry and condensed - matter physics an escape from the intractable ` @xmath11-electron ' problem , in addition to its computational implications , dft has deep epistemological implications in regard to the foundational ideas of physics .",
    "dft claims that the many - body wavefunction can be dispensed with , and that the physics of a given system can be discussed as a functional of the one - body density .",
    "thus even entanglement can be discussed in terms of density functionals  @xcite .",
    "however , it is the computational power of dft that has been universally exploited in many fields of physics .",
    "the interest in thermonuclear fusion via laser compression and related techniques , and the advent of ultra - fast lasers have created novel states of matter where the electron temperature @xmath0 is usually of the order of the fermi energy @xmath1 , under conditions where they are identified as warm dense matter ( wdm )  @xcite . when wdm is created using a fast laser within femto - second time - scales , the photons couple strongly to the electrons which are heated very rapidly to many thousands of degrees , while the ions remain essentially at the initial ` ambient ' temperature  @xcite .",
    "in addition to highly non - equilibrium systems , this often leads to two - temperature systems with the ion temperature @xmath3 , with @xmath12 . alternatively , if shock waves are used to generated a wdm we may have @xmath13 .",
    "such ultra - fast matter ( ufm ) systems can be studied using a fs - probe laser within timescales @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the electron - ion temperature relaxation time  @xcite of the ufm system .",
    "these wcm systems are of interest in astrophysics and planetary science  @xcite , inertial fusion  @xcite , materials ablation and machining  @xcite , in the hot - carrier physics of field - effect transistors and other nano - devices  @xcite .",
    "early attempts to apply thermal - dft ( also called finite-@xmath5 dft , th - dft ) to wdm - like systems were undertaken by the present author and franois perrot in the early 1980s as reviewed in ref .",
    "this involved a reformulation of the neutral - pseudoatom ( npa ) model that had been formulated by dagens  @xcite for zero-@xmath5 problems , as it has the versatility to treat solids , liquids and plasmas .",
    "originally it was j. m. ziman  @xcite ( and possibly others ) who had proposed the npa model as an intuitive physical idea in the context of solid - state physics .",
    "the electronic structure of matter is regarded as a superposition of charge densities @xmath17 centered on each nuclear center at @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , if the total charge density in momentum space was @xmath19 , then this is considered as being made up of the individual charge distributions @xmath20 put together using the ionic structure factor @xmath21 .",
    "this was more explicitly implemented in muffin - tin models of solids , or ` atoms - in molecules ' models of chemical bonds that were actively pursued in the 1960s , with the increasing availability of fast computers .",
    "the npa model was formulated rigorously within @xmath4 dft by dagens who showed that it was capable of the same level of accuracy , at least for ` simple metals ' as the lmto , apw or korringa - kohn - rostoker codes that were becoming available in the 1970s  @xcite .",

    "some of these  @xcite are extensions of the inferno cell - model of lieberman  @xcite , while others  @xcite use a mixture of npa ideas as well as elements of chihara s `` quantum - hnc '' models  @xcite .",

    "this feature is absent in inferno - like cell - models where the chemical potential is determined via an integration within the ion - sphere or by some such consideration .",
    "thus different physical results may arise ( e.g. , for the conductivity ) depending on how the chemical potential is fixed .",
    "chihara s models use an ion susbsytem and an electron subsystem coupled via a ` quantal ornstein - zernike ' equation .",

    "hence the question has been raised as to whether the thermal corrections to the @xmath4 xc - functional may be conveniently disregarded .",

    "the current level of accuracy in wdm experiments is nowhere near that .",

    "furthermore , in any electron - ion system containing _ even one _ bound state , the electron density @xmath30 becomes large as one approaches the atomic core , and hence there are spatial regions @xmath76 where @xmath77 , when finite-@xmath5 xc comes into play . since the ` free - electron ' states are orthogonal to the core states , the free - electron density pile - up @xmath33 near a nucleus immersed in a hot - electron fluid is also equally affected , directly and via the core .",
    "furthermore , @xmath33 is a property that directly enters into the calculation of the x - ray thomson scattering signal as well as the electron - ion pseudopotential @xmath78 .",

    "most dft codes use a simulation cell of linear dimension @xmath88 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in such a model the smallest value of @xmath89 in momentum space is @xmath90 and this prevents the direct evaluation of various properties ( e.g. , @xmath91 ) as @xmath92 . in the npa model a large sphere of radius @xmath93 such that all particle correlations have died out is used , and phase shifts of continuum states , taken as plane waves , are calculated .",
    "this procedure allows an essentially direct access to @xmath94 properties as well as the bound and continuum spectrum of the ion in the plasma .",
    "however , the difficulty arises when the electronic bound - states spread beyond the wigner - seitz radius of the ion .",
    "the question of determining the number of free electrons per ion , viz .",

    "if the electronic charge density can not be accurately represented as a superposition of individual atomic charge densities , the definition of @xmath97 becomes more complicated since a bound electron may be shared between two or more neighbouring atoms that form bonds .",
    "transition - metal solids and wdms have @xmath101-electron states which extend outside the atomic wigner - seitz sphere . hence assigning them to a particular nuclear center",
    "becomes a delicate exercise .",
    "however , even in such situations there are meaningful ways to define @xmath97 and @xmath95 that lead to consistence with experiment .",
    "in such situations the proper value of @xmath95 may differ from one physical property to another as the averaging involved in constructing the mean value @xmath95 may change .",
    "a similar situation applies to the effective electron mass @xmath102 which deviates from the ideal value of unity ( in atomic units ) , and takes on different values according to whether we are discussing a thermal mass , an optical effective mass , or a band mass that we may use in a luttinger - kohn @xmath103 calculation .",
    "experimentally , @xmath95 is a measure of the number of free electrons released per atom .",

    "that is , such a calculation will be valid only if the @xmath101-electrons are fully delocalized and partake in the heating process by being coupled with the pump laser creating the wdm .",
    "the argument that @xmath95 is not a valid concept or a quantum property because there is no ` operator ' corresponding to it has no merit .",
    "the temperature also does not correspond to the mean value of a quantum operator .",

    "in considering a system of ions with a distribution @xmath110 , and an electron distribution interacting with it , the free energy @xmath111 has to be regarded as a functional of both @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "hence the ground state has to be determined by a coupled variational problem involving a constrained - search minimization with respect to all physically possible electron charge distributions @xmath30 , and ion distributions @xmath29 , subject to the usual formal constraints of @xmath11-representability etc .",
    "the euler - lagrange variational equation from the derivative of @xmath111 with respect to @xmath30 , for a fixed @xmath29 would yield the usual kohn - sham procedure with the rigid electrostatic potential of @xmath29 providing the external potential .",
    "however , if no static approximation or born - oppenheimer approximation is made , we can obtain another euler - lagrange variational equation from the derivative of @xmath111 with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "this coupled pair of equations treated via density - functional theory involves not only the @xmath112 , but also @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the latter involving correlations ( but no exchange ) as it arises from ion - ion interactions beyond the self - consistent - field approximation . in effect , just as the electron many - body problem can be reduced to an effective one - body problem in the kohn - sham sense , we can thus reduced the many - ion problem into a  single - ion problem \" .",
    "such an analysis was given by us long ago  @xcite .",
    "the ion - ion correlations can not be approximated by any type of local - density approximation , or even with a sophisticated gradient approximation .",
    "however , perrot and the present author were able to show that a fully non - local approximation where an ion - ion pair - distribution can be constructed _ in situ _ using the hnc equation provides a very satisfactory solution .",
    "this is equivalent to positing that the ion - ion correlation functional is made up of the hyper - netted - chain diagrams .",
    "however , significant insights are needed in regard to the electron - ion correlation functionals which involve the coupling between a quantum subsystem and a classical subsystem .",
    "this is largely an open problem that we have attempted to deal with via the classical - map hnc approach , to be discussed below .",
    "the advent of wdm and ultra - fast matter has thrown out a number of new challenges to the implementation of thermal dft . a simple but at the moment unsolved problem in ufm may be briefly described as follows .",
    "a metallic solid like al at room temperature ( @xmath115 ) is subject to a short - pulse laser which heats the conduction electrons to a temperature @xmath0 which may be 6 ev . the core electrons ( which occupy energy bands deep down in energy and hence not excitable by the laser ) remain essentially unperturbed in the core region and at the core temperature , i.e. , at @xmath116 0.026 ev . the temperature relaxation by electron - ion processes is ` slow ' , i.e. , it occurs in pico - second times scales . on the other hand ,",
    "electron - electron processes are ` fast ' , and hence one would expect that the conduction - band electrons at @xmath0 to undergo exchange as well as coulomb scattering within femto - second time scales , consistent with electron - electron interactions timescales . thus , while we have a quasi - equilibrium of a two - temperature system holding for up to pico - second timescales , the question arises if one can meaningfully calculate an exchange and correlation potential between the bound electrons in the core at the temperature @xmath115 , and the conduction - band electrons at @xmath0 , with @xmath12 . while we believe on physical grounds that a thermal dft is applicable at least in an approximate sense , an unambiguous method for calculating the two - temperature xc - energies and potentials is as yet unavailable .",
    "once the pair - distribution function of a classical or quantum coulomb system is known , all the thermodynamic functions of the system can be calculated from @xmath42 .",
    "the xc - information is also in the @xmath42 .",
    "only the ground - state correlations are needed in calculating the linear transport properties of the system .",
    "hence , most properties of the system become available .",
    "it is well known that correlations among classical charges ( i.e , ions ) can be treated with good accuracy via the the hyper - netted - chain equation , but dealing with the quantum equivalent of hyper - netted - chain diagrams for quantum systems is difficult , even at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "when we have an electron subsystem interacting with the ion subsystem , obtaining the pdfs becomes a difficult quantum problem even via more standard methods .",
    "we need to solve for a many - particle wavefunction which rapidly becomes intractable as the number of electrons is increased beyond a small number .",
    "the message of dft is that the many - body wavefunction is not needed , and that the one - particle charge distribution @xmath30 is sufficient .",
    "while the charge distribution at @xmath4 involves a sum over the squares of the occupied kohn - sham wavefunctions , at very high @xmath5 the classical charge distribution is given by a boltzmann distribution containing an effective potential felt by a single ` field ' particle , and characterized by the temperature which is directly proportional to the classical kinetic energy .",
    "in chnc we attempt to replace the quantum - electron problem by a classical coulomb problem where we can use a simple method like the ordinary hnc equation to directly obtain the needed pdfs , at some effective ` classical fluid ' temperature @xmath117 having the same density distribution as the quantum fluid .",
    "the electron pdf @xmath118 of the non - interacting quantum electron fluid is known at any temperature and embodies the effect of quantum statistics ( pauli principle ) .",
    "hence we can ask for the effective potential @xmath119 which , when used in the hnc , gives us the @xmath118 , an idea dating back to a publication by f. lado  @xcite .",
    "this ensures that the non - interacting density has the required ",
    "@xmath11-representable \" form of a slater determinant .",
    "of course , only the product @xmath120 can be determined by this method , and it exists even at @xmath4 . then the total pair potential to be used in the equivalent classical fluid is taken as @xmath121 .",
    "how does one choose @xmath122 since the pauli term is independent of it ?     and",
    "@xmath123 at @xmath50=1 are shown .",

    "( d)finite temperature pdfs ( chnc ) for @xmath45=2 , @xmath50=5 would correspond to a wdm at @xmath125 3.6 ev ( @xmath126 42,000 k ) .",
    ", width=377 ]    to a very good approximation , if @xmath117 is chosen such that the classical fluid has the same coulomb correlation energy @xmath127 as the quantum electron fluid , then it is found that the pdf of the classical coulomb fluid is a very close approximation to the pdf of the quantum electron fluid at @xmath4 .",
    "there is of course no mathematical proof of this .",
    "however , from dft we know that only the ` correct ' ground state distribution will give us the correct energy , and perhaps it is not surprising that this choice is found to work . the @xmath117 that works for the @xmath4 quantum electron gas is called the  quantum temperature \" @xmath128 .",
    "more details of the method are given in ref .",
    "there it is argued that , to a good approximation , for a finite-@xmath5 electron gas at the physical temperature @xmath5 , the effective classical fluid temperature @xmath129 . this has been confirmed independently by datta and dufty  @xcite in their study of classical approximations to the quantum electron fluid .",
    "thus chnc provides all the tools necessary for implementing a classical hnc calculation of the pdfs of the quantum electron gas at finite-@xmath5 .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ gr - fig ] pair - distribution functions calculated using chnc , and those available in the literature from quantum simulations at @xmath4 , as finite-@xmath5 pdfs from quantum simulations are hard to find . in any case",
    "the classical map is expected to be better as @xmath5 increases and the @xmath4 comparison is important . in the figure ,",
    "diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) and variational monte carlo ( vmc ) data@xcite are compared with chnc results . in fig .",
    "[ gr - fig ] the parallel - spin pdf is marked @xmath130 , while the anti - parallel spin pdf is marked @xmath123 .",
    "the latter has a finite value as @xmath131 as there is no pauli exclusion principle operating on them .",
    "furthermore , the the mean value of the operator of the coulomb potential , i.e. , @xmath132 , is of the form @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the thermal de broglie wavelength of the electron pair , as discussed in ref .",
    "this ` quantum - diffraction ' correction ensures that @xmath135 has a finite value , as seen in the figure .",
    "it is in good agreement with quantum monte carlo results .",
    "thus the chnc is capable of providing a good interpretation of the physics underlying the results of quantum simulations .",
    "needless to say , unlike quantum monte carlo or path - integral simulation methods , the chnc integral equations can be implemented on a laptop and the computational times are imperceptible .    using the pdfs @xmath136 calculated with a scaled coulomb potential @xmath137 , a coupling constant integration over @xmath69 can be carried out to obtain the xc - free energy @xmath138 as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fxc - fig ] , this procedure leads to good agreement with the thermal - xc results from the pimc method , while only the @xmath4 spin - polarized @xmath127 data were used in constructing @xmath128 . furthermore , since @xmath117 tends to the physical temperature at high @xmath5 , and since the hnc provides an excellent approximation to the pdfs of the high-@xmath5 electron system , the method naturally recovers the high-@xmath5 limit of the classical one - component plasma .",
    "note that we could not have started from the high-@xmath5 limit of an ideal classical gas and used the well - known classical coupling constant ( i.e. , @xmath72 integration method , e.g. , see baus and hansen or ichimaru  @xcite ) to determine @xmath139 from an integration that ranges from @xmath140 to the needed temperature ( i.e , the needed @xmath72 ) .",
    "this is because there is no clear method of capturing the physics contained in @xmath128 , and ensuring that fermi statistics are obeyed ( e.g. , via the introduction of a @xmath119 ) , as there is only boltzmann statistics at @xmath73 .    the ability of the chnc to correctly capture the thermal - dft properties of the finite-@xmath5 quantum fluid suggests its use for electron - ion systems like compressed hydrogen ( electron - proton gas ) , or complex plasmas with many different classical ions interacting with electrons  @xcite , _ without having to solve the kohn - sham equations _ as in bredow _ et al . _",
    "the extensive calculations of bredow _ et al . _",
    "establish the ease and rapidity provided by chnc , without sacrificing accuracy .",
    "chnc has potential applications for electron - positron systems or electron - hole systems where both quantum components can be treated via the classical map",
    ". it also provides a partial solution to the still unresolved problem of formulating a fully - nonlocal ` orbital - free ' approach that directly exploits the hohenberg - kohn - mermin theory , without the need to go via the kohn - sham orbital formulation .",
    "we have argued that our current knowledge of the thermal xc - functionals is satisfactory and the stage is set for their implementation in practical dft codes . noting the complexity of warm - dense matter , we have emphasized simplifications as well as extensions which do not sacrifice accuracy . in this respect the neutral - pseudo atom model can , in most cases do the work of the _ ab initio _ codes like vasp , and handle high - temperature problems that are beyond their scope .",
    "orbital - free approaches  @xcite will also become increasingly useful , especially at intermediate and high @xmath45 .",
    "nevertheless , the _ ab initio _ codes are needed at low - temperature low - density situations involving molecular formation , where the npa breaks down as it is a `` single - center '' approach .",
    "however , in many wdm cases , we need to go beyond the picture where the ion subsystem is held static , and the electrons only feel them as an ` external potential ' . hence we have emphasized the need for calculating not just the xc - functionals for electrons , but also the classical correlation functionals for ions , as well as the ion - electron correlations directly , _ in situ _ , via direct coupling - constant integrations of all the pair - distribution functions of the system , ensuring a fully non - local formulation where gradient expansions are not needed .",
    "in fact , there is no need for any xc - functionals in such a scheme . to do this efficiently and accurately ,",
    "we have proposed a classical map of the quantum electrons and implemented it in the chnc scheme which depends on dft ideas .",
    "this capacity is not found in any of the currently available methods .",
    "chnc has been used to construct a finite-@xmath5 xc functional for electrons more than a decade before pimc results became available , and it turns out that the chnc results are accurate . the chnc scheme has been successfully used for calculating the equation of state and other properties of warm dense matter as well as multi - component @xmath4 electron - layer systems , thick layers etc .",
