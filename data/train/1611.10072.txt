    "<S> the finite temperature phase diagram is obtained for an infinite honeycomb lattice with spin-@xmath0 ising interaction @xmath1 by using thermal - state fidelity and von neumann entropy based on the infinite projected entangled pair state algorithm with ancillas . </S>",
    "<S> the tensor network representation of the fidelity , which is defined as an overlap measurement between two thermal states , is presented for thermal states on the honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fidelity per lattice site and the von neumann entropy can capture the phase transition temperatures for applied magnetic field , consistent with the transition temperatures obtained via the transverse magnetizations , which indicates that a continuous phase transition occurs in the system . in the temperature - magnetic field plane , the phase boundary is found to have the functional form @xmath2 with a single numerical fitting coefficient @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the critical temperature and field with the boltzmann constant @xmath6 . for the quantum state at zero temperature </S>",
    "<S> , this phase boundary function gives the critical field estimate @xmath7 , consistent with the known value @xmath8 calculated from a cluster monte carlo approach . </S>",
