    "parton distributions are fundamental and universal quantities of the qcd - improved parton model .",
    "they depend on the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parent hadron , @xmath4 , as well as on the hard scale of the process , @xmath0 .",
    "the inclusive cross - sections describing hard processes are governed by the ( collinear ) factorisation theorem expressing those cross - sections as convolutions of partonic distributions and hard ( partonic ) cross - sections @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "less inclusive measurements are often sensitive to the transverse momenta of the partons and require an introduction of the _ unintegrated _ parton distributions , _ i.e. _ distributions which are not integrated over the transverse momentum of the parton @xcite .",
    "these unintegrated distributions depend then upon the transverse momentum of the parton besides the dependence on @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "typical cases where the information on the transverse momentum of partons is needed are the prompt photon production , or the transverse momentum distributions of the drell - yan lepton pairs , @xmath5 and @xmath6 bosons , _ etc . _",
    "the unintegrated parton distributions are also needed in the calculations made within the @xmath7-factorisation framework @xcite .",
    "the unintegrated parton distributions are described by the catani - ciafaloni - fiorani- marchesini ( ccfm ) equations @xcite which are based on the quantum coherence implying angular ordering along the partonic cascade @xcite . in the so - called single - loop approximation @xcite ,",
    "adequate for large and moderately small values of @xmath4 ( say , @xmath8 ) , the ccfm equations reproduce the conventional leading - order dglap equations for the integrated distributions .",
    "thus , they may be viewed as an extension of the dglap evolution which allows to investigate more general quantities .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse in detail the unintegrated parton distributions of pions and nucleons . to this aim",
    "we explore the system of the ccfm equations in the single loop approximation utilising the transverse - coordinate representation of the parton distributions .",
    "the transverse - coordinate , denoted in this paper by @xmath9 , is a variable conjugate to the transverse momentum of the parton .",
    "it has been widely used in the study of the soft gluon resummation effects in the @xmath10 collisions @xcite , in the transverse - momentum distributions of the drell - yan pairs or gauge bosons @xcite , _ etc . _",
    "the formalism adopted in our analysis is similar to methods used in those studies .",
    "an important merit of our use of the transverse - coordinate representation is the fact that it _",
    "diagonalises _ the system of the ccfm equations in the single - loop approximation @xcite . in practice",
    ", this means that the equations are solved independently for each value of @xmath9 . also , in this approximation the non - perturbative effects encoded in the choice of the initial dependence on @xmath9 at the reference scale @xmath11 ( the profile function ) factorise in the solution at a scale @xmath0 .",
    "this input profile introduces the damping factor for large values of @xmath9 that makes it possible to extend smoothly the partonic @xmath7-distributions down to the point @xmath12 .",
    "the ccfm evolution changes the dependence on @xmath9 and leads to significant broadening of the transverse momentum distributions .",
    "the average transverse momentum squared grows approximately linearly with @xmath13 ( modulo logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "the effect is strongest for gluons , when e.g. for @xmath3 the ccfm evolution is found to generate @xmath14 about @xmath15 for @xmath1 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "these numbers should be compared to the initial spreading , @xmath18 , which is typically assumed to be in the range of @xmath19 .",
    "broadening of the @xmath7 distribution corresponds to the development of the long - range tail in the distribution at large @xmath7 .",
    "+ the average transverse momenta squared can be expressed in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the distributions in the @xmath9 representation at @xmath20 .",
    "factorisation of the input profile implies that the average transverse momentum squared of the parton is the sum of the primordial ( non - perturbative ) component at @xmath11 and the term generated by the evolution .",
    "the unintegrated parton distributions are constrained by the integrated distributions which correspond to the integrals of the unintegrated distributions over the transverse momentum squared of the partons . in order to make our analysis realistic we use constraints implied by the results of the global lo qcd analysis @xcite for the integrated distributions of pions and nucleons . to be precise",
    ", we take the same parametrisation of the starting integrated distributions as those used in @xcite and assume , as an educated guess , a gaussian transverse momentum distribution , uniform for gluons and quarks . combining this assumption with the evolution from the ccfm equations in the single - loop approximation one",
    "should get a set of realistic unintegrated parton distributions hadrons .",
    "these can be used in phenomenological applications in the mentioned region of large and moderately small values of @xmath4 , where the single - loop approximation is expected to be adequate .",
    "the content of our paper is as follows : in the next section we recall the system of the ccfm equations in the single - loop approximation and discuss its transverse coordinate representation . in sec . 3 we discuss the unintegrated parton distributions of pions and nucleons which follow from the numerical solution of the ccfm equations in the single - loop approximation .",
    "we present our results for the @xmath9 profiles and for the transverse - momentum distributions , as well as discuss the increase of the average transverse momentum with the increasing magnitude of the hard scale , @xmath0 , at different values of @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the moments of the @xmath9 profiles and present results for the average transverse momenta squared , @xmath21 , for the @xmath22th moment for partons of species @xmath23 .",
    "we also derive ( semi)analytic expressions for @xmath21 . in sec .",
