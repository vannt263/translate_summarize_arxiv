    "the close connection between the narrow line and the radio emission in seyfert galaxies is a well known fact .",
    "the first papers in this subject found a correlation between the [ oiii ] and radio luminosities , and between the radio luminosity and the fwhm of the [ oiii ] lines ( debruyn & wilson 1978 , heckman et al .",
    "1981 , whittle 1985 ) .",
    "emission line and radio imaging of seyfert galaxies shows that the radio and line emission of these galaxies is aligned ( haniff et al .",
    "higher resolution imaging shows , for some of these galaxies , that the radio emission is surrounded by line emission ( pogge & de robertis 1995 , capetti et al .",
    "1996 , falcke et al .",
    "1998 ) , which suggests that the narrow line region gas ( nlr ) is ionized by shocks due to the interaction of the radio plasma with the gas ( see figure 1 for an example ) .",
    "another evidence of shocks in the nlr of seyferts is the detection of anomalous velocity fields , like double components separated by hundreds of km / s ( whittle et al .",
    "1988 , winge et al .",
    "1997 , hutchings et al .",
    "1998 ) , and `` extra '' line widths associated with radio jets ( whittle 1992 ) .",
    "these results lead dopita & sutherland ( 1995 , 1996 ) to propose a series of models where the nlr is ionized by fast shocks , with velocities in the range 150@xmath3 km / s . according to their models , high energy photons",
    "are created behind the shock and ionize the preshock gas upstream ( precursor ) .",
    "this model has several predictions , which were analyzed by morse et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and wilson ( 1997 ) , and are summarized below .",
    "the models predict we should find line emission surrounding radio lobes , and a photon deficit in the nlr .",
    "however , this can also be explained by the unified model ( see young et al .",
    "2001 for a discussion on x - ray results ) .",
    "shocks can explain the [ oiii ] temperature problem in these galaxies , where the measured gas temperature is much higher than the one predicted by simple photoionization models , but this can also be explained combining matter bounded and ionization bounded clouds ( binette et al .",
    "1996 ) .    here",
    "we present the preliminary results of a radio and [ oiii]@xmath05007imaging survey of a sample of seyfert galaxies .",
    "we discuss the case of two individual galaxies and calculate a limit to the h@xmath1 luminosity that can be due to shocks in those galaxies without extended radio emission .",
    "our radio continuum survey was done using the vla in a - configuration at 3.6  cm , which gives a resolution of 0.25@xmath4 .",
    "the results of this survey were published by kinney et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and schmitt et al .",
    "the [ oiii ] survey is underway .",
    "it started with the cfht and is now being done with hst .",
    "one of the results from the radio continuum survey is that only 50% of the seyferts show extended emission .",
    "this percentage decreases to 25% if we count only those galaxies where the radio emission is composed of multiple components . comparing the radio and [ oiii ] images we find some interesting cases , like ngc5347 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this figure shows that the [ oiii ] emission is resolved , but the radio emission is unresolved , contrary to what would be expected if shocks were important in the ionization of the nlr of this galaxy .",
    "on the other hand we also have cases like mrk79 ( figure 1 ) , where both the [ oiii ] and radio emission are extended and cospatial , suggesting that shocks may be an important source of ionizing photon .",
    "we discuss these galaxies below .",
    "we will use in the following subsections the equations given by dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) to predict the h@xmath1 luminosity produced by a shock and the precursor , which are , respectively , @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the shock area , @xmath8 is the shock velocity and @xmath9 is the preshock density .",
    "this is a seyfert 2 galaxy with a radial velocity of 2335 km s@xmath10 , so 1@xmath4 corresponds to 150 parsecs at the galaxy ( we assume h@xmath11 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ) . as we can see in figure 2 ,",
    "the [ oiii ] image is extended , with a cone shaped structure in the circumnuclear region . at @xmath12",
    "ne from the nucleus we can see [ oiii ] emission detached from the nuclear emission ( ne structure ) , with a total linear extent of 2@xmath4 .",
    "the borders of this structure are well aligned with the borders of the cone structure at the nucleus , suggesting that the nlr is ionized by the nuclear source , and the collimation of the radiation is due to a circumnuclear torus .",
    "figure 2 also shows the archival vla 6  cm image of this galaxy , which is unresolved .",
    "the radio emission is unresolved at 3.6  cm , 6  cm and 20  cm , indicating that we did not resolve out diffuse emission around the nucleus .",
    "in fact , the comparison between the 20  cm flux from the nuclear source ( 3.4  mjy ) with that from the entire galaxy ( 5.6  mjy ) , obtained from the nvss , shows that most of the radio emission in this galaxy originates in the nuclear region .",
    "here we calculate how much of the h@xmath1 emission from the ne structure can be due to shocks .",
    "if we assume that the h@xmath1 flux is produced by a shock seen edge - on , with a circular cross section of radius 1@xmath4 , we get that the shock area is 0.071 kpc@xmath13 ( 6.75@xmath14 cm@xmath13 ) .",
    "gonzlez delgado & prez ( 1996 ) obtained spectra of this galaxy and showed that the ne structure has l(h@xmath16 erg  s@xmath10 , [ oiii]/h@xmath17 , @xmath18  @xmath19 , and the fwhm([oiii])@xmath20 km  s@xmath10 . according to ferruit et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the pre - shock density for a shock with this velocity would be of the order of @xmath21  @xmath19 . using the equations given above , for a shock of velocity @xmath22  km  s@xmath10 and preshock density @xmath21  @xmath19 , we get l(h@xmath23 erg  s@xmath10 and l(h@xmath24 erg  s@xmath10 for the shock and precursor , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath2510% of the observed h@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "another problem with the shock ionization of the ne structure is that the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratio can only be reproduced with a shock of 400 km  s@xmath10 , which is inconsistent with the observed fwhm of the [ oiii ] line .",
    "we now use this same approach for the nuclear region of this galaxy .",
    "according to gonzlez delgado & prez ( 1996 ) , the nuclear spectrum has l(h@xmath26 erg  s@xmath10 and @xmath27  @xmath19 .",
    "they also found that the [ oiii ] line can be decomposed into a narrow and a broad component , with the broad component having fwhm([oiii])=500  km  s@xmath10 . again",
    ", if we assume that we are seeing the shock edge - on , with a circular cross section of radius 0.5@xmath4 , we get that the shock area is 0.018  kpc@xmath13 ( 1.7@xmath14 cm@xmath13 ) .",
    "we get that for a shock velocity @xmath28  km  s@xmath10 and a preshock density @xmath29  @xmath30 , l(h@xmath31 erg  s@xmath10 for the shock and @xmath32 erg  s@xmath10 for the precusor , which corresponds to @xmath33% of the observed h@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "these results indicate that shocks are not extremely important for the ionization of the nlr of this galaxy .",
    "the [ oiii ] and radio images of mrk79 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "this figure shows that the [ oiii ] emission of this seyfert 1 galaxy is extended by @xmath34 along the n - s direction .",
    "the radio emission lies along the same direction , but is extended by only @xmath12 .",
    "the radio structures to the n and s of the nucleus are surrounded by the [ oiii ] emission , suggesting that shocks may play an important role in the ionization of the gas . using the same technique used for ngc5347 , we calculate what would be the contribution of shocks to the h@xmath1 luminosity of the n and s regions of the nlr .",
    "we assume the shocks have a circular cross section of radius 0.5@xmath4 , which corresponds to an area of 0.145  kpc@xmath13 ( @xmath35 cm@xmath13 ) , considering the galaxy has a radial velocity of 6643  km  s@xmath10 . from whittle",
    "et al . ( 1988 ) we have that the n and s lobes have fwhm([oiii])=400  km  s@xmath10 and 350  km  s@xmath10 , respectively , which we assume to be the shock velocities .",
    "assuming a preshock density @xmath3610  @xmath19 , we can calculate that the sum of the shock and precursor h@xmath1 luminosities are @xmath37  erg  s@xmath10 for the n component , and @xmath38  erg  s@xmath10 for the s component . using our cfht h@xmath39 image and assuming h@xmath39/h@xmath40",
    ", we get the observed l(h@xmath1)@xmath41  erg  s@xmath10 and @xmath42  erg  s@xmath10 for the n and s components , respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath2525% of the photons ionizing the n and s lobes of this galaxy can be due to shocks .",
    "another test of the importance of shocks to the ionization of the nlr of seyferts was done using those galaxies for which we do not observe extended radio emission .",
    "we use the same method used for ngc5347 and mrk79 .",
    "since these galaxies are unresolved in radio , we make the conservative assumption that the shock has a circular cross section with radius 0.25@xmath4 , two times larger than the resolution of the observations .",
    "we do not have information about the fwhm([oiii ] ) of these galaxies , so we assume that all the galaxies have shocks of 500 km  s@xmath10 , at the high end of the parameters modeled by dopita & sutherland ( 1995 , 1996 ) , and use a preshock density of @xmath29  @xmath19 .",
    "given these assumptions , we should consider these results as upper limits to the contribution of shocks to the ionization of these nlr s .",
