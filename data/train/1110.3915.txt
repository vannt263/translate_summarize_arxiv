    "the measurement of a very weak force such as the detection of gravitational wave demands a very high resolution interferometer .",
    "the role of the interferometer is to transform small variation of the relative spatial separation of the mirrors between two arms into variation of the output photons .",
    "quantum noise presumably places a limitation on accuracy of the measurement  @xcite .    in quantum optics ,",
    "the discussion related to quantum noise of radiation fields on the mirror has been mostly based on the photon - number approach .",
    "it is argued by caves  @xcite that quantum noise in a laser interferometer may come from the quantum nature of the light directly via photon number fluctuations ( shot noise ) or indirectly via random motion of the mirror due to a fluctuating force ( radiation pressure fluctuations ) . minimizing the total uncertainty from two sources of noise , with an assumption of no correlation between them , may give the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , when an input power of the light is appropriately tuned .",
    "additionally , caves further suggests that injecting squeezed vacuum state into the unused port of an interferometer should lead to the sql with a lower optimum input power  @xcite , as compared with the standard interferometer  @xcite .",
    "this seminal work also shows the manipulated quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields are responsible for both the radiation - pressure forces and the fluctuations of the photon number .",
    "then , an inquiry into the assumption of no correlation between these two noise sources arises .",
    "in particular , the presence of negative correlations may lead to the uncertainly even below the sql . to establish their correlations",
    "requires an unified scheme that has been proposed by loudon  @xcite .",
    "the judicious use of the correlated squeezed state is proposed to establish the above correlations with which to possibly push the sensitivity of the interferometer beyond the sql  @xcite .",
    "the redesign of an interferometer by adding some optical components to either manipulate the read - outs or modify the dynamics of the test mass , such as in the `` optical bar ''  @xcite or the `` optical spring ''  @xcite scheme , is also possibly to give non - zero correlations in order to beat the sql .",
    "the coupling between the mirror and the radiation field can be obtained by considering the mirror as a reflector that imposes boundary conditions of the field on the surface of the mirror . in 3 + 1 dimensions , field quantization",
    "is treated perturbatively for a slowly moving , perfectly reflecting mirror by vilenkin and ford  @xcite , with the boundary conditions of the field on the surface of the mirror at all times .",
    "they then explore the backreaction dissipative effect on a moving mirror , induced by vacuum fluctuations of the field . later",
    "a corresponding langevin equation was derived by two of us  @xcite with the method of influence functional , in which the accompanying noise , manifested from vacuum fluctuations is taken into account .",
    "thus , the effects of the backreaction dissipation and its accompanying noise can be related by the underlying fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "unruh  @xcite extended the quantization scheme to the interferometer case where the field propagates toward a mirror and then acquires a time - dependent phase shift after reflecting off the mirror . because of the moving boundary , the phase shift in general depends on the mirror s motion , but can be obtained by assuming slow - motion of the mirror .",
    "similar phase shift was also introduced by kimble _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and it has been proposed to improve performance of the laster interferometer , particularly , in  @xcite .    here",
    "we adopt the field quantization scheme similar to unruh s proposal to investigate the problem of quantum noise and its associated correlation in a simpler configuration , shown in fig .",

    "the basic idea is to consider a free , perfectly reflecting mirror .",
    "a coherent state of the quantum scalar field is normally shined on the mirror s surface , and exerts a pressure force on the mirror .",
    "it drives the mirror into motion , which in turn leads to variation of the reflected field",
    ". then the read - out field is measured by a standard monopole detector , which is placed somewhere between the mirror and the field source .",
    "since the radiation pressure is described by a surface integral of the stress - tensor of the scalar field , if the input quantum state is not an eigenstate of the operator associated with the response function of the detector or the stress - tensor , the resulting measurement will exhibit fluctuations .",
    "the goal of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first of all , we lay out a field - theoretic approach by which the effective distance between the detector and the mirror can be decoded from the read - out fields . in this simpler system",
    ", the sources of the uncertainty in the read - outs can be easily identified in the slow motion limit when the mirror is driven by radiation pressure of the incident field .",
    "thus reduction in uncertainty of this effective distance is of essence to improve the sensitivity of the interferometer .",
    "when the incident field is in the single - mode coherent state , it will be shown that the particle number approach , typically used in quantum optics , is equivalent to this field theoretic approach in the late - time limit with a large number of the scalar particles ( photon ) .",
    "we will elaborate the previously mentioned approximations later .",
    "in addition to shot noise and radiation pressure fluctuations , a new source of noise comes from modified field fluctuations .",
    "it is induced by the mean displacement of the mirror as a result of the radiation pressure .",
    "its effect can be systematically examined in the field theoretic approach .",
    "secondly , the emphasis is put on how correlation among all sources of quantum noise associated with the radiation field , can emerge when the interference of the incoming field and the reflected filed by the mirror are taken into account .",
    "we further examine the effects of correlation on possible reduction of uncertainty in the read - outs of the monopole detector .",
    "we show an example in which the overall uncertainty can be suppressed to beat the standard quantum limit .    our presentation is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , we introduce the quantization scheme of a massless scalar field subject to boundary conditions on a free , perfectly reflecting mirror when it undergoes slow motion .",
    "the motion of the mirror arises from radiation pressure of the scalar field .",
    "a monopole detector is introduced to measure the readout field .",
    "we then identify the sources of quantum noise from the fluctuations of the readouts in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] with an emphasis on establishing correction between them .",
    "the effects of correlation are further studied in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] for possibility of reducing overall quantum noise . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] the langevin equation of the mirror , including backreaction from the radiation field , is derived , and we show that this effect is negligible for slow motion .",

    "the signature of the metric is @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a free mirror of perfect reflectance is illuminated by a single - mode coherent laser , which propagates in a direction normal to the mirror .",
    "the radiation pressure of the laser will drive the mirror into motion , and the field , bounced off the mirror , can be measured by a detector . for simplicity and without loss of generalization , the radiation field is represented by a massless scalar field @xmath2 to suppress complexity caused by the vector nature of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the mirror , with mass @xmath3 , is placed at @xmath4 .",
    "its lateral dimensions in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 directions are large compared to wavelength of the incoming state , and the cross sectional area is @xmath7 .",
    "we use @xmath8 to denote directions normal to the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the incident field is a plane wave propagating along the positive @xmath9 direction toward the mirror .",
    "the boundary condition of the field on the mirror surface is then given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the displacement of the mirror from its original position at @xmath12 due to radiation pressure . the approximate solution to the field equation subject to this moving boundary condition in the region of @xmath13",

    "the prime over the integrals of @xmath21 means that the modes with @xmath22 are excluded because these modes propagate in the negative @xmath9 direction and will not interact with the mirror in the @xmath13 region .",
    "here we have assumed that the mirror undergoes slow motion ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "since the incoming wave is a right - moving plane wave along the @xmath9 direction , the left - moving reflected wave will receive a time - dependent phase shift due to the motion of the mirror .",
    "the phase shift of the reflected field at time @xmath24 and position @xmath9 depends on the mirror s position at an earlier time @xmath25 if we take finite lapse of propagation into consideration .",
    "when the displacement is small , we may take the retarded time @xmath26 as @xmath27 in the leading order approximation .    due to small displacement approximation",
    ", the force acting on the mirror by the fields can be approximated by the area integral of the @xmath28 component of the energy - momentum stress tensor of the scalar field , evaluated at the mirror s original position @xmath4 , @xmath29 where the @xmath28 component of the energy - momentum stress tensor takes the form @xmath30\\,.\\ ] ] hereafter we will use @xmath31 to denote the area element normal to the @xmath9 direction . thus ,",
    "if the mirror is at rest at @xmath4 for @xmath32 , then the displacement operator due to the action of radiation pressure of the incident state is formally given by @xmath33 since the energy - momentum stress tensor is quadratic in the field operator @xmath2 , the displacement operator is not well - defined .",
    "a proper renormalization of mirror s position operator can be done by absorbing the vacuum expectation value of the displacement operator into the initial position @xmath34 , namely , @xmath35 this prescription is physically sensible since when the mirror is placed at its initial position , the vacuum fluctuations of the field have already interacted with the mirror before the incoming state impinges on it .",
    "thus , the renormalized displacement operator @xmath36 now takes the form @xmath37 here the backreactions of the field is ignored .",
    "this backreaction can be incorporated in the langevin equation , eq .  , and is found negligible for a slowly moving mirror . to avoid cluttering the notion",
    ", we will suppress the subscript @xmath38 of the renormalized quantities hereafter .    to measure the outcomes of the scalar field ,",
    "we employ a monopole detector .",
    "we assume that the detection processes is based on the stimulated transition of the detector due to coupling between the scalar field and the monopole moment @xmath39 of the detector , @xmath40 in the standard detector theory , the dynamics of the detector is governed by some time - independent hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "assume that the detector is a two - level system with eigen - energies @xmath42 , @xmath43 such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in the interaction picture the monopole moment evolves in time as @xmath46 then by first - order perturbation theory , the transition rate between these two states of the detector is given by @xmath47 the response function @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49 where we have assumed that the incident field is in a single - mode coherent state @xmath50 with frequency @xmath51 .",
    ".   implies that we may construct an integral quantity by @xmath52 with @xmath53 where the detector is placed at @xmath54 and the position of the mirror is located at @xmath55 .",
    "the quantity @xmath56 is a measure that generically summarizes accumulated measurement results over finite time duration .",
    "integration over an area of the mirror size illustrates the situation that if the size of the detector is much greater than @xmath57 of the incoming coherent mode , then the measurements have been averaged in the lateral spatial direction .",
    "then in terms of the mode functions of the scalar field , @xmath58 can be expressed as @xmath59 for the coupled mirror - field system , we notice that they are at least two sources that will contribute to the uncertainty associated with @xmath56 .",
    "one directly results from quantum fluctuations of the incoming field , but the other indirectly comes from the stochastic motion of the mirror , which in turn is the consequence of radiation - pressure fluctuations of the field . in other words ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the incoming field will drive the mirror into stochastic motion , and next the moving mirror will modify the reflected field in a complicated way , depending on mirror s motion . if we use the a detector to measure field variation at @xmath60 , the detector will see combined effects from the incoming and the reflected field .",
    "it will be shown later that the interference between the right - moving ( incoming ) and left - moving ( outgoing ) field leads to the result that the phase of the expectation value of the operator @xmath61 depends on the effective distance between the mirror and the detector .",
    "in addition , this interference effect is essential to establish correlation between different sources of quantum noise .",
    "this phenomenon gives a hope to reduce overall quantum noise .",
    "since the mirror is driven by the radiation pressure of a single - mode coherent state with the frequency @xmath51 , the assumption of slow motion of the mirror can be realized by @xmath62 this suggests that we may formally expand the field operators , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in a power series of the the displacement operator @xmath11 .",
    "the operator ordering can be quite ambiguous in this case .",
    "however , it can be shown that the leading - order result is independent of operator ordering .",
    "thus , for example , up to the second order in @xmath65 , we may just expand @xmath56 into @xmath66 irrespective of the operator ordering .",
    "apparently , the first term represents the measurement performed with respect to the mirror s original position .",
    "the other terms can be understood as corrections which result from the mirror s motion due to radiation pressure .",
    "the single - mode coherent state of the background field can be obtained by applying the displacement operator @xmath67 on the corresponding vacuum state , @xmath68 where the displacement operator @xmath67 is defined by @xmath69 \\,.\\ ] ] then , for a fixed position of the mirror , the signal is given by the expectation value of @xmath70 , which is obtained from eq .   by setting @xmath71 @xmath72",
    "the result depends on the relative distance between the detector plane and the mirror surface , which arises from the optical path difference between the right - moving ( incoming ) field and the left - moving ( outgoing ) field .",
    "if a free mirror , instead of a fixed one , is considered , the above result will be modified to account for the additional effect due to the mean displacement of the mirror .",
    "we further assume that the coherent state under consideration has a sufficiently large particle density @xmath73 so that in this state , the ratio of the operator s fluctuations over its expectation value , which is typically inversely proportional to @xmath73 , is small .",
    "thus , the variation of @xmath74 can be approximated by @xmath75 if , given an operator @xmath76 , its variation @xmath77 is defined as @xmath78 .",
    "this gives a leading - order effect of the noise .",
    "later we will offer an order - of - magnitude estimate of the ignored terms .",
    "the first term of arises from the intrinsic fluctuations of the incident state . for a large value of @xmath73",
    ", the particle number has relatively small uncertainty ; thus according to , the main contribution to the variation of @xmath79 for fixed @xmath51 does not come from amplitude uncertainty , but is given by the phase fluctuations , as will be seen later in eq .  .",
    "it is thus associated with shot noise .",
    "the other terms may be understood as the induced effects due to either the position fluctuations of the mirror , or the modified field fluctuations as a result of the mean displacement of the mirror .",
    "then the variation of @xmath80 allows us to define the overall uncertainty of the effective distance between the detector and the mirror , @xmath81 as long as @xmath82 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath83 is to measure the change of @xmath84 due to variation of the mirror s position .",
    "control of the above uncertainty is essential to improve the sensitivity of the interferometer , in which the measurement of the separation between the mirrors and the beam splitter plays an important role .    to compute the square of the effective displacement uncertainty @xmath85 of the mirror ,",
    "we may encounter terms such as @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and their cross correlation terms .",
    "since both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are quadratic in field operators @xmath90 , they are not well - defined in the coincidence limit @xmath91 .",
    "we expect that the square of the effective displacement uncertainty should contain terms involving a product of four field operators . thus it may be more transparent if we decompose such a product as follows , @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the expectation value of the scalar field in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the first term is a fully normal - ordered term , the next six terms are cross terms , and the final three terms are pure vacuum terms .",
    "for a single - mode coherent state , the fully normal - ordered terms cancel , and then we are left with @xmath94 the cross terms and the pure vacuum terms may be singular because the field operators will be evaluated at the same point .",
    "it has been shown that the spacetime average of the pure vacuum term leads to a result that varies as an inverse power of the size of the spacetime  @xcite . on contrary , the cross terms depend on the particle density of the coherent state .",
    "for a large value of the particle density , the cross terms can dominate over the pure vacuum terms  @xcite .",
    "thus we will consider the contributions from the cross terms and ignore the pure vacuum terms .",
    "since the integrals that contain cross terms may still diverge , a finite result is obtained  @xcite by choosing the principal value of the singular integral .",
    "here we take an alternative approach to cope with the singular vacuum contribution so that all results become regular .",
    "they prove to be the same in the end .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the expectation value of the operators in eq .  .",
