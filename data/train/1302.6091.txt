    "the spectrum of the prompt emission of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) is generally fitted with the celebrated band spectral model ( band et al .",
    "this model represents a non - thermal spectrum , and it can be described in terms of two smoothly joined power laws . generally speaking , band model adequately fits most of the time - integrated prompt emission spectra of grbs , though additional spectral components show up for some grbs ( e.g. , preece et al .",
    "1996 ; gonzalez et al . 2003 ; shirasaki et al .",
    "but , to emphasise , the exceptions are very few in number in comparison with the large set of grbs , which can be fitted with a simple band only function ( e.g. , kaneko et al .",
    "2006 ; nava et al .",
    "zhang et al . (",
    "2011 ) have found that 15 out of 17 lat detected grbs could be fitted with band only model ( category i , in their notation ) .",
    "hence , the band function , till date , is the simplest , standalone model for grb spectra , whether time - integrated or time - resolved .",
    "although the band model is statistically the most appropriate model of grb data , its physical origin is yet to be identified . over the years",
    ", many authors have investigated the underlying mechanism of the prompt emission . in the fireball model of grb ,",
    "the observed radiation during the prompt emission is attributed to a highly relativistic optically thick outflow , which thermalizes photons due to random collisions .",
    "this thermal energy is expected to be seen from the photosphere ( goodman 1986 ; paczynski 1986 ; meszaros & rees 2000 ; peer 2008 ) , where the fireball becomes optically thin and radiation decouples from the matter . in this scenario ,",
    "the light curve ( lc ) is expected to be a single , smooth pulse and the spectrum should be a lorentz boosted bb , while the temperature of the bb adiabatically cools . hence , the time - integrated spectrum should be a superposition of many bbs . though some grbs do have a single pulse , most grb light curves are either superposition of many pulses or they are highly variable .",
    "moreover , a bb in the rayleigh - jeans region has a photon index 1.0 , which is much harder than that actually observed for grbs ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "many models have been proposed to overcome these difficulties .",
    "for example , the internal shock model ( rees & meszaros 1994 ; woods & loeb 1995 ; sari & piran 1997 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ) assumes that the major radiation is not due to photospheric emission , but optically thin synchrotron radiation ( sr ) from internal shocks .",
    "one major problem with the synchrotron radiation is that the low energy photon index is limited to @xmath1 ( preece et al .",
    "crider , liang & preece ( 1998 ) , using time - resolved spectra of 99 grbs , have shown that the instantaneous spectra and their evolution can not be explained by sr  @xmath2 often crosses the line of death , set by the synchrotron model .",
    "another possibility is that the radiation is due to inverse compton ( ic ) of the thermal photons near the photosphere ( thompson 1994 ; peer et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; beloborodov 2010 ; lazzati & begelman 2009 ) .",
    "this process can indeed produce a band like spectrum , but with a rather hard value of @xmath3 at the best , assuming slow heating .",
    "a unique prompt emission model of a grb is yet to be settled .",
    "from the phenomenological point of view , the correct model can be identified by segregating the details from the average properties .",
    "for example , grbs are superpositions of pulses ( nemiroff 2000 ; norris 2005 ) .",
    "hence , one should use the individual pulses for spectral study , instead of the full grb .",
    "the next step is to study the spectral evolution within the individual pulses .",
    "hence , one should do time - resolved spectroscopy in order to extract greater information than merely an average spectral property of a pulse , e.g. , average peak energy , isotropic energy etc .",
    "but , performing such a detailed study is difficult , as one loses photon counts .",
    "for example , ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2010 ) have done time - resolved spectral study of 9 selected grbs , detected by gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboard the fermi satellite .",
    "as the photon count is low in each time bin , they could model the spectra only with a cut - off powerlaw . parameters of a more complicated model , such as band , can not be well constrained from the time - resolved data .",
    "the solution to this problem lies in the realisation that spectral evolution is not totally unpredictable , and one can suitably parametrize this evolution in order to reduce the number of free parameters of the description .",
    "for example , the spectral evolution of a grb pulse is generally described as a hard - to - soft evolution ( e.g. , liang & kargatis 1996 ; kocevski & liang 2003 ; nemiroff 2012 ) .",
    "recently , basak and rao ( 2012a ; b ) have assumed this hard - to - soft evolution of the individual pulses of the set of 9 grbs of ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to generate simultaneous spectral and timing model of the pulses , with essentially two parameters , namely , the peak energy at the start of the pulse ( @xmath4 ) and the characteristic evolution parameter ( @xmath5 ) . the basic assumptions in this approach ,",
    "however , are not well established .",
    "for example , it was assumed that the spectral softening happens throughout the pulse , though there are evidences that some grb pulses show a different behaviour like the intensity tracking spectral evolution ( see e.g. , lu et al . 2012 ) .",
    "further , it was also assumed that the applicable model is the band function throughout .",
    "hence , it is essential to critically examine all the applicable spectral models and their evolution to arrive at a correct pulse - wise description of a grb .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a new method for pulse - wise spectral analysis where we parametrize the spectral evolution in order to arrive at the correct spectral description with a minimum set of free parameters .",
    "we apply this method to study grb 081221 , the brightest grb with clean , separable pulses .",
    "we compare the results obtained for this grb with those for grb 090618  the brightest grb in the fermi era .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows  in section 2 , we describe the analysis techniques and the basic assumptions of our model .",
    "results are given in section 3 , and major conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "the basic necessity for a good spectral analysis of grb pulses is wide band coverage to identify additional spectral components .",
    "the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) on board the fermi satellite , with its wide band width and excellent sensitivity , provides a good data base for such studies .",
    "it has two scintillation detectors : the sodium iodide ( nai ) detector is sensitive in the @xmath6 8 kev to @xmath7 900 kev range while the bgo energy range is @xmath7 200 kev to @xmath7 40 mev ( meegan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we examined the nava catalog ( nava et al .",
    "2011 ) of fermi/ gbm grbs and found that there are 112 bright ( fluence @xmath8 erg ) , long ( @xmath9 s ) grbs and 11 of these grbs have single/ separable pulses .",
    "grb 081221 is the brightest among them . in figure  [ lc ] , we have plotted the light curve ( lc ) of this grb with norris model ( norris et al . 2005 ) fitted for the two pulses .",
    "we have also made a systematic analysis of the other 10 grbs and the time - integrated spectral analysis for all of them is given later .",
    "we use the cspec data for time - integrated study and the time tag event ( tte ) data for the time - resolved spectral analysis .",
    "we choose 2 or more nai detectors having high count rate and one/ both bgo detector ( s ) .",
    "for source selection and background subtraction , we use the _ rmfit v3.3pr7 _ tool , developed by user contributions of fermi science support center ( fssc ) . the background exposure time is chosen before and after the burst .",
    "this background is modelled by a polynomial of different degrees , according to the need .",
    "the pha files are binned in energy channels so as to get a minimum count in each spectral bin .",
    "typically , the nai detectors are binned by minimum count @xmath10 , while the bgo detectors are binned by requiring a minimum count of @xmath11 .",
    "first , we perform time - integrated analysis for all the 11 bright , long grbs having single/ separable pulses .",
    "we implement both c - stat and @xmath12 minimization methods in _ rmfit_. we fit either band or cut - off powerlaw ( cpl ) model .    in table 1 , we report the best fit parameter values along with the corresponding 3@xmath13 errors .",
    "the reduced c - stat and @xmath14 with degrees of freedom ( dof ) are also reported .",
    "for comparison , we quote the results of nava et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for these grbs .",
    "it is clearly seen that all these values are matching quite well .",
    "the sources of very minor deviations between the values of this work , done by c - stat minimisation and nava et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are : ( i ) mismatch between actual start and stop time , ( ii ) exact background selection and modelling and , ( iii ) the exact number of detectors and the channels used . comparing the deviation of the parameter values ,",
    "it is clear that the deviation due to using different statistics other than c - stat , i.e. @xmath12 minimisation , is much less than that due to these other reasons .",
    "hence , we conclude that the statistics plays a minimal role in actual parameter estimation . in fact",
    ", the grbs taken in our analysis are all bright grbs ( fluence @xmath8 erg ) .",
    "hence , by default , the @xmath12 minimisation is a correct technique for parameter estimation of grbs with high count rates .",
    "we select four models for the spectral study : a ) band model , b ) blackbody with a power - law , c ) a modified blackbody with a power - law and d ) two blackbodies with a power - law .",
    "the band function can be written in terms of the spectral indices ( @xmath2 and @xmath15 ) and the peak energy ( @xmath16 ) as :      here , @xmath18 is the normalisation constant .",
    "a model consisting of thermal ( blackbody with temperature kt ) and non - thermal ( power law with index @xmath19 ) components has been used earlier ( see , e.g. , ryde 2004 , ryde et al .",
    "2006 , ryde and peer 2009 , peer and ryde 2011 ) .",
    "we name this function as bbpl .",
    "this can be written as : @xmath20}+k_{2}e^{-\\gamma } \\label{bbpl}\\ ] ] where k1 and k2 are normalisation constants .",
    "there are suggestions ( e.g. , ryde et al . 2010 ) in the literature of a modified blackbody ( mbb ) , which may exist due to angular dependence of the optical depth and the observed temperature ( peer 2008 ) .",
    "hence , we also investigate this model with a powerlaw ( mbbpl ) .",
    "the mbb model is a multi - colour blackbody disk model ; the local disk temperature kt(r ) is proportional to @xmath21 . in several grbs",
    "there are distinct additional thermal components ( see eg .",
    "shirasaki et al .",
    "2008 ) and further , if the grb spectrum is due to thermal inverse compton ( ic ) of seed photons , then there may be , in principle , multiple photon baths . for brevity , we take one more bb component and call it 2bbpl model .",
    "this has essentially two bbs with two temperatures  @xmath22 and @xmath23 and two normalisations  @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we use all the four models for our subsequent analysis .",
    "we note here that it is also possible to have combinations of the above models ( like band+pl , band + bb + pl ) , but , at this juncture , we consider only these four generic models .",
    "this is essentially because of the fact that the time resolved spectra of grbs generally consists of a broad peak with wings , which can be adequately captured by any of the above four models .",
    "time - resolved spectral studies require a large number of parameters .",
    "if ` n ' is the number of time bins , then a four - parameter model , such as band or bbpl , requires 4n parameters for a full description .",
    "our motivation , in this study , is to reduce the number of parameters with some reasonable assumptions .",
    "the basic assumption we make is that the temperature ( kt ) and the peak energy ( @xmath26 ) follow smooth time evolution .",
    "this evolution has a break at the peak of the pulse ( see also ryde and peer 2009 ) . in the following discussion we shall refer to them as two episodes  rising and falling part .",
    "we assume that the time evolution law of kt and @xmath26 is simple powerlaw of time i.e. , @xmath27 , with different @xmath28 in different episodes . if ` m ' and ` n ' are the number of time bins in these two episodes , respectively , then this parametrization reduces the number of free parameters by ` m+n-2 ' .",
    "note that , ideally one should use one more parameter to account for the start time , but we have chosen it to be zero for all the cases , except for the rising part of grb 090618 , where the pulse starts from -1 sec .",
    "hence , only for this case , we have chosen this start time to be -10 sec . as the parametrization",
    "is not corrected for the actual start time , the actual values of @xmath28 are not unique and hence , these values should not be used to compare different pulses .",
    "we also assume that for the band model the photon indices ( @xmath2 and @xmath15 ) are constants in each episode .",
    "their values can be determined by simultaneously fitting all the time - resolved spectra in an episode , with the photon indices tied . for bbpl model , we assume that the index ( @xmath19 ) of the powerlaw ( pl ) is constant in each episode",
    ". this index can be determined in the similar way as the photon indices of the band .",
    "the parametrization of the norm of bbpl model is more complicated , as , unlike band , we have two norms . in the band model",
    ", norm is a free parameter . in order to have equal number of parameters as band , either we can use an overall free norm with suitable parametrization of bbpl norms , or , we can parametrize one of the norms and treat the other as a free parameter .",
    "ryde and peer ( 2009 ) have shown that the parameter @xmath29 either increases with time or remains constant .",
    "if we assume that the observed flux of the bb varies as a simple function of time as @xmath30 , then the variation of @xmath31 can be parametrized as @xmath32 . for @xmath33 , @xmath31",
    "will show the expected behaviors .",
    "the bb flux variation can be translated to the norm variation of equation  [ bbpl ] as @xmath34 . now , if we parametrize the bb norm and treat the powerlaw ( pl ) norm as a free parameter of the model , we have the same number of free parameters as band model .",
    "but , this makes the bbpl more constrained , in the sense that the overall norm is not a free parameter , as in the case of band model . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "let us assume ( which will be justified later ) that the powerlaw ( pl ) component has norm variation as smooth as that of bb , i.e. , @xmath35 . then the overall norm ( k ) can be made a free parameter by parametrizing the ratio of the bb norm and pl norm as @xmath36 .",
    "thus , both band and bbpl models have equal number of free parameters  ` m+n+8 ' . for band model , `",
    "m+n ' are norms of band function in ` m+n ' time bins .",
    "the other 8 parameters are @xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath28 and the @xmath26 at the starting bin , @xmath37 , in the two episodes . peak energy at any time ` t ' is determined by @xmath38 . for the bbpl model , ` m+n ' are overall norms ( k ) and the other four parameters are powerlaw index ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath28 , @xmath39 and kt at the initial bin , kt(@xmath40 ) , in the two episodes . for mbbpl model , we have an added parameter , namely , p , in each episode .",
    "hence , the number of parameters is ` m+n+10 ' . for 2bbpl model ,",
    "the photons are boosted by the same material , hence , the bb parameters can not be arbitrary .",
    "we assume that the ratio of temperatures and norms of these bbs are fixed , which should be determined by tying the ratios in all bins .",
    "hence , the number of parameters in this model is ` m+n+12 ' . as an example",
    ", if there are 5 time bins preceding to the peak of a pulse and 10 bins afterwards , then the parametrization for band and bbpl reduces the number of free parameters from 60 to 23 ; for a total of 25 bins this factor is 100 to 33 and so on .    to compare the significance of a model with respect to another , we have performed the f - test .",
    "the f value is defined in most general case as , @xmath41 , where index 1 is used for the primary model , while 2 is used for the alternative model .",
    "we compute the probably ( p ) of a given f value and thereby find the @xmath13 significance ( and the % confidence level ) of the alternative model preferred over the primary model .",
    "if the primary model is a subset of the alternative model , then the f value is defined as , @xmath42 and the difference between the dofs ( m ) is deemed as the dof of the primary model .",
    "we start with a time - resolved spectral analysis so that some of the assumptions sketched above can be examined and validated . the major challenge in time - resolved spectroscopy is to define the time bin size , which crucially depends on two factors  a ) timescale of spectral evolution and b ) the minimum bin size allowed by the data , which in turn depends on the subjective decision of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "one can not violate the latter condition for a given snr .",
    "the peak count rate of this grb is @xmath7 4000 , while we have demanded that each pha bin should have at least 40 counts ( snr @xmath7 6.3 , i.e. , total @xmath7 5000 counts , for 128 channels ) .",
    "hence , we can not choose smaller than @xmath7 1 sec time bin .",
    "first , we choose uniform time bins of 3 second to extract time - resolved spectra .",
    "later , we reduce the time bin to 1 second to check any improvement due to finer time bins .      in table",
    "[ 081221_a ] , we report the results of band and bbpl fit to the time - resolved data of 3 second bin size .",
    "the time bin starts from -1 sec , with 14 bins ( numbered 0 to 13 ) .",
    "approximately , first 4 bins belong to pulse 1 , last 8 bins belong to pulse 2 and the 2 intermediate bins belong to the overlapping region . for the bbpl fit",
    ", we first fit the spectra with the powerlaw index ( @xmath19 ) free .",
    "we note that @xmath19 is more or less constant for the major portion of the burst ( bin # 0 - 2 for pulse 1 and # 6 - 11 for pulse 2 ) .",
    "we take the average of @xmath19 over these bins , separately for the two pulses , and found in both cases , @xmath19=1.83 with standard deviation ( @xmath13 ) 0.14 and 0.10 for pulse 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 has large error bars in the last bin of pulse 1 and last 2 bins of the second pulse .",
    "the values in the overlapping region ( # 4 and # 5 ) , apart from having large errors , may be ambiguous , and hence neglected .",
    "we freeze @xmath19 to 1.83 for all the bins and redo the analysis .",
    "the corresponding values are also reported in table  [ 081221_a ] .",
    "note that , by doing this we are gaining one degree of freedom in each time bin .",
    "it is clear from table  [ 081221_a ] that for the second pulse , the time - resolved spectral fit with the band model are much better than those of the bbpl fit in terms of the @xmath43 . on the contrary , these values are comparable in the first pulse . hence , the first pulse may be dominated by thermal emission .",
    "note , however , that @xmath43 of bbpl is poor in bin # 1 of the first pulse , which has , in fact , the highest flux .",
    "hence , this points to a different radiation mechanism than a simple bb , which may appear in the high flux regions .    in figure  [ chi ]",
    ", we have plotted the @xmath43 of bbpl with @xmath19 thawed , bbpl with @xmath19 frozen and band fit with filled circles , open circles and stars , respectively .",
    "the bbpl model is clearly inferior to the band model for a major portion of the second pulse , specially in the regions where photon counts are high . in the first pulse (",
    "-1 to 11 sec ) , the bbpl model , except for the one bin is comparable to the band model .",
    "we also fit mbbpl and 2bbpl , which are shown by filled boxes and pluses .",
    "the mbbpl and 2bbpl are as good as the band model , in terms of @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the correct model for the major portion of the burst is either of these three .      in the time - resolved analysis of section 3.1.1 ,",
    "the band and other models show superior fits compared to the bbpl model in terms of @xmath43 .",
    "but , as zhang ( 2011 ) pointed out for grb 090902b , this can be an effect of evolution of the bbpl within a time bin . to investigate this ,",
    "we make finer time bins of 1 second and redo the time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "note that this is the finest bin possible for a snr @xmath7 6.3 . in table",
    "[ av_chi ] , we report the average values of @xmath43 for different model fittings , obtained for different bin sizes .",
    "apparently , there are improvements in the @xmath43 for finer bins , but we also see that these improvements are of the same orders for different models . hence , it seems that the spectrum is not due to the evolution of bbpl , but one of these other models .",
    "but , all of these models are comparable .",
    "hence , we can not hope to find the correct model by taking finer bins .",
    "presence of a simple blackbody ( bb ) is apparent in the first pulse , with the exception of the second bin , where one of the other models is correct .",
    "the second pulse is dominated either by a modified blackbody or a fully non - thermal radiation ( band ) or inverse compton ( 2bbpl ) . in order to find the right answer , one should carefully parametrize the spectral evolution in each episode of the pulses separately and reduce the set of free parameters in the description .",
    "the spectral evolution in the pulses are not arbitrary .",
    "for example , the temperature of the blackbody evolves with time in a smooth way .",
    "this can be seen from figure  [ t_kt_epeak ] , where we have plotted the kt of bbpl ( both @xmath19 free and frozen ) by circles .",
    "the peak energy variation is shown by pluses .",
    "the parameters evolve smoothly as a function of time . for a single pulse , ryde and peer ( 2009 )",
    "have shown that the temperature remains constant or slowly declines with an average powerlaw index , @xmath44 with @xmath45 , during the rise of the pulse and decays faster with an average index @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the break time of this evolution has a strong positive correlation with the pulse peak time .",
    "we find a similar behaviour for both kt and @xmath26 evolution .",
    "hence , the spectral evolution can be described by a simple time evolution of temperature ( @xmath48 ) or the peak energy ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the index , @xmath28 , in principle may have two values in the two episodes , namely , the rising and the falling part .    liang and kargatis ( 1996 ; hereafter lk96 ) showed for fred pulses that the peak energy of the ef(e ) ( or @xmath50 ) spectrum follows a more complicated evolution .",
    "@xmath26 decreases exponentially with the running fluence as :    @xmath51    where , @xmath4 and @xmath52 are the constants of the @xmath16 evolution law , @xmath53=@xmath54 , is the fluence at time t , @xmath55 being the flux . in figure  [ kt_epeak_fluence ] ( upper panels ) , we have plotted the ln ( @xmath26 ) with the fluence .",
    "note that the fluence of each pulse is calculated from their respective start time .",
    "clearly , the @xmath26 evolution strictly follows the lk96 law in the first pulse . in the second pulse , however , the variation is not smooth throughout . in the falling part ,",
    "the variation is clearly lk96 type , but in the rising part , the variation is rather `` soft - to - hard '' .",
    "this effect may come due to overlap between two pulses .",
    "in fact , the first two bins of the second pulse belong to the overlapping region .",
    "hence , they might be contaminated with the preceding pulse . however , the third bin , where there should not be any effect of the first pulse , also deviates from the lk96 law .",
    "this might indicate that the second pulse is genuinely intensity tracking .",
    "kocevski and liang ( 2003 ) argued that the `` intensity tracking '' pulses for which this evolution does not appear very prominent , are rather made of more than one short hard - to - soft pulses .",
    "ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2011 ) , on the other hand , have analysed time - resolved spectra of 11 long and 12 short fermi grbs and found that the long grbs appear to follow a `` soft - hard - soft '' trend , tracking the flux of the grb , rather than a strict `` hard - to - soft '' evolution .",
    "lu et al . (",
    "2012 ) have categorised grb 081221 as one having a strict `` hard - to - soft '' pulse followed by `` intensity - tracking '' pulse .",
    "they have simulated overlapping pulses to show that in the overlapping region , the spectral evolution may appear `` intensity - tracking '' .",
    "however , they also found some single pulses to have `` intensity - tracking '' spectral evolution . hence , the second pulse may be genuinely `` intensity tracking '' .    in figure  [ kt_epeak_fluence ]",
    "bottom panels , the temperature evolution is plotted against blackbody fluence . here",
    "the same behaviour is noticed .",
    "hence , kt evolution of the first pulse and the falling part of the second pulse can as well be described by a similar exponential decay :    @xmath56    where @xmath57=@xmath54 is the running fluence of the blackbody component at time t , @xmath55 being the flux at @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are the constants of the evolution law .",
    "lk96 law is empirical and a simpler version , in principle , can be used instead , such as a simple powerlaw of time .",
    "as fluence is a monotonically increasing function of time , either of them can be used for evolution study .",
    "the bbpl model has two components .",
    "hence , in order to parametrize the norms of this model one has to see the flux evolution of the individual components . in figure  [ flux_evolution ] , we have plotted both photon and energy flux of the individual components calculated for 8 - 900 kev energy range . the flux evolutions look similar for both @xmath19 free and frozen cases .",
    "interestingly , the pl flux is as smooth as the bb flux , in each pulse .",
    "hence , as argued in section 2.3 , we can safely assume that the ratio of their evolutions is a smooth function of time . in figure  [ par_evolution ]",
    ", we have shown the evolution of @xmath2 , @xmath15 of band and @xmath19 of bbpl .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 , in many cases , have either large error bars or only an upper limit could be derived . in some cases , they peg to the value -10 .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ par_evolution ] that the parameters remain reasonably constant at all episodes ( rising and falling part ) of a pulse .",
    "hence , we tie them over all the time bins in a given episode to determine them with greater accuracy .",
    "this reduces the number of free parameters of the description of spectral evolution to a great extent , as described in section 2.3 .",
    "the fact that the parameters are well behaved functions of time , makes the time - resolved spectroscopy more tractable , as we can reduce the number of free parameters in the pulse - wise description ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "following the parametrization and tying scheme of setion 2.3 , we do the spectral analysis for the individual pulses of the grb . in the following analysis ,",
    "we use the tte data of nai  n0 , n1 , n2 and bgo  b0 for our analysis .",

    "is much better .",
    "however , the 2bbpl model , which shows comparable or better fit than band in all cases , is only comparable to mbbpl in this particular case .",
    "this may arise due to the fact that this pulse is actually a combination of two highly overlapping pulses ( see rao et al .",

    "hence , the band and 2bbpl models are comparable , though we can not rule out the possibility of contamination even in this falling part .    in the rising part ( see table  [ 090618_b ] ) , though mbbpl is better than bbpl , it is inferior to 2bbpl and band .",

    "2bbpl is comparable to band . in summary of this pulse",
    ", the whole episode can be described by band model .",
    "this is in contrast with the second pulse of grb 081221 , where mbbpl clearly dominates the rising part , and then it is taken over by band .",
    "from purely data analysis point of view , there are essentially two parts in a grb spectrum  the peak of the spectrum and the wings , which extend to very low and very high energies .",
    "the fundamental difference between a band only model and the models with thermal and non - thermal parts is : while band accounts for the peak position , with exponential fall in the wings , the other models have thermal component to account for the peak position , and a powerlaw , falling slower than an exponent , holding the spectra at the wings . in principle , all these spectra should be equally good at the peak position , except for the fact that band and mbb have broader peak than simple bb , while 2bbpl has double hump .",
    "hence , the difference between these models arises mainly in the wings .",
    "the bb is inferior to the others if the peak is not narrow . as photon count at",
    "the peak is larger , the residual should show up immediately .",
    "but , this is not easy to see if the difference occurs in the wings .",
    "consequently , the three very different models , namely , band , mbbpl and 2bbpl show comparable @xmath12 , while fitting time - resolved data .",
    "hence , re - binning at these wings plays a very important role to pin down the correct model .",
    "however , we can not expect an order of magnitude improvement in the @xmath12 , because , binning in these wings gives 6 - 8 broad bins ( see section 3.3.1 ) with large errors , while the major statistics comes from the peak position .",
    "we have found , in our analysis , that the spectrum changes from one pulse to the other , and even within a pulse .",
    "the fact that one of these four models is superior than the others , in a particular episode , points to the fundamental radiation mechanism .",
    "we see that this change of superiority is not random . for example , the first pulse of both the grbs have shown that a mbbpl model is better , though marginally , than band in the rising part . for grb 081221 , this could be described even by bbpl model in the rising part , which is really pointing towards the thermal origin of radiation in the first pulses .",
    "similar observations are reported in the literature e.g. , ryde et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed , in the 1 - 3 s time bin of batse detected grb 981021 , that a bbpl is better fit than a band model .",
    "note that the low energy photon index ( @xmath2 ) of the band model crosses the synchrotron limit in the rising part , where the thermal models are adequate .",
    "however , in the falling part of all the pulses , where band is better than mbbpl , @xmath2 is consistent with the synchrotron limit .",
    "hence , we can safely conclude that the radiation mechanism starts with a thermal origin , but is rapidly overtaken by synchrotron mechanism .",
    "the first pulse may be dominated by the photospheric emission in all episode , but the second pulse is mostly synchrotron dominated .",
    "the second pulse may or may not have a thermal origin .",
    "for example , the second pulse of grb 081221 shows a mbbpl model in the rising part , which then becomes synchrotron dominated in the falling part . on the other hand ,",
    "the second pulse of 090618 is always synchrotron dominated .",
    "hence , the transition between these different radiation paradigms is smooth and repeatable .    in comparison to the mbbpl model",
    ", we note that the 2bbpl is particularly better in all episodes .",
    "this model sometimes shows superiority to the band model , even at the falling part of a pulse , except for the second pulse of grb 090618 , though we can not rule out the possibility of two highly overlapping pulses in this particular case .",
    "softer component than band were reported for a few batse grbs by preece et al .",
    "shirasaki et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , using the time - resolved spectral data of grb 041006 , detected by hete-2 ( 2 kev to 400 kev ) , found multiple spectral components , each having characteristic evolution . after the launch of fermi satellite ,",
    "these earlier claims were reconfirmed in some cases .",
    "for example , guiriec et al . ( 2011 ) , fitting the time - integrated spectrum of grb 100724b , have shown the presence of an additional blackbody ( bb ) component along with the traditional band spectrum ( also see burgess et al .",
    "in our analysis , we have used two blackbodies to account for the softer components .",
    "the origin of these two components is speculative",
    ". they might be different locations of the boosted front of the fireball having same temperature , but different boosting factors .",
    "alternatively , they can be different seed photon baths , up - scattered by the bulk material .",
    "irrespective of its origin , this model shows superiority to all other models in all episodes .",
    "note that , though 2bbpl model has double hump in the peak , one of the peaks may occur in the lower wing ( i.e. , < 15 kev ) .",
    "hence , it is easy to identify this model , only if the difference occurs at the peak .",
    "figure  [ spectrum ] clearly shows the double hump in the residuals of the bbpl fit .",

    ", we have plotted in figure  [ lower_bb ] , the residuals of 2bbpl fit , with the lower bb omitted .",
    "this technique is well known for finding iron line profile in the inner accretion disks of black holes ( see e.g. , miller 2007 ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum with the 2bbpl model and then omit the lower bb . the residual ( expressed as normalized counts kev@xmath72 s@xmath72 ) of the fit clearly shows this bb component .",
    "residuals of different detectors are shown by different markers .",
    "we have overplotted the lower bb model ( in terms of normalized counts kev@xmath72 s@xmath72 ) on the residual to guide the eye .",
    "we have plotted these residuals for second , sixth and ninth time bins from top to bottom panels to show that the bb peaks at lower energies at later times .    in summary , we have rigorously used the evolution of parameters in the pulses of a grb to construct various spectral models with a minimum number of parameters .",
    "we have constructed band model with parametrized peak evolution and tied photon indices , bbpl with parametrized norm ratio of the bb and pl , parametrized temperature , and tied pl indices .",
    "apart from these , we have used mbbpl and 2bbpl , which , other than the parametrizations of bbpl , have tied p indices , and tied ratios of temperatures and norms , respectively .",
    "this new method is quite general in the sense that any such model can be incorporated with suitable parametrization .",
    "the fact that the parametrization works demands a close look into the theoretical predictions of various radiation models .",
    "these models , irrespective of their complexities , should produce such smooth variations of parameters within a pulse of a grb .",
    "also , if there is really a transition from one radiation mechanism to another , one should correctly model the mechanism of such transition .",
    "the fact that the synchrotron model is applicable at the falling part of the pulses , without invoking any other component , is really intriguing and demands a close look at the predictions of the internal shock model .",
    "one of the surprising result obtained in this work is that the 2bbpl model is statistically superior to the other models in most of the episodes in these two grbs .",
    "basak & rao ( 2012c ) have used this model for grb 090902b .",
    "the residual of bbpl fit clearly shows double humps ( see figure 3 of basak & rao 2012c ) which are taken care by the two peaks of the 2bbpl model .",
    "we selected this model purely in a phenomenological and data analysis perspective : distinct blackbody components ( apart from the main peak in the spectrum ) are seen in a few grbs and while looking at the residuals , two humps are clearly discernible in a few time bins . since these two are the brightest grbs for such analysis ( grb 081221 is the brightest grb in the category of grbs with single/ separable pulses and grb 090618 is the brightest grb in the fermi era ) , it is unlikely that we can reinforce this result by analysing data from other grbs .",
    "one method could be to get the pulse - wise spectral parameters of a sample of grbs and relate them to other properties of grbs like redshift , afterglow properties etc .",

    "<S> time - resolved spectral analysis , though a very promising method to understand the emission mechanism of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , is difficult to implement in practice because of poor statistics . </S>",

    "<S> we use this method for the two pulses of grb 081221 , the brightest grb with separable pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we choose , from the literature , a set of possible models which includes the band model , blackbody with a power - law ( bbpl ) , a collection of black bodies with a smoothly varying temperature profile , along with a power - law ( mbbpl ) , and two blackbodies with a power - law ( 2bbpl ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we perform time - resolved study to confirm the spectral parameter variations , and then construct the new model to perform a joint spectral fit . </S>",
    "<S> we find that any photospheric emission in terms of black bodies is required mainly in the rising parts of the pulses and the falling part can be adequately explained in terms of the band model , with the low energy photon index within the regime of synchrotron model . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that 2bbpl is comparable or sometimes even better , though marginally , than the band model , in all episodes . </S>",
