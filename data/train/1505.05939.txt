    "in wireless networks , idle nodes have a potential to participate in transmission of other nodes to form cooperative communication .",
    "cooperation among nodes has been shown as an effective technique to widen the coverage and to improve the performance of wireless networks in both terms of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and diversity gain @xcite . in the most basic cooperation form of single - source single - destination network ,",
    "a relay estimates the source signal and then forwards it to the destination .",
    "it is shown that relay networks achieve a performance gain when compared with the non - cooperative counterpart @xcite . in order to achieve this gain ,",
    "however , additional orthogonal channel is usually required , which results in loses in spectral efficiency , especially when more than one relay is employed .",
    "fortunately , such loss in multiple - relay networks can be effectively reduced by using opportunistic relay selection ( rs ) , in which only the best relay is selected for cooperation @xcite .",
    "it is shown that rs can achieve full diversity order for single - source multiple - relay networks and outperform other relaying schemes in terms of snr gain and effective capacity @xcite .",
    "network coding ( nc ) has gained tremendous attention because of its potential improvement in diversity gain and throughput over classical routing techniques @xcite . in nc ,",
    "an intermediate node combines multiple input packets into a linear combination which is then forwarded .",
    "recently , there have been much studies on combining nc together with rs to further improve the spectral efficiency , mostly focusing on the two - way relay channel ( twrc ) .",
    "the authors in @xcite propose a joint design of nc with rs for decode - and - forward ( df ) twrc based on the max - min criterion in order to maximize the worst relay channel . in @xcite ,",
    "a snr - based suboptimal relay ordering is proposed for two way amplify - and - forward ( af ) relay networks .",
    "a similar method is studied in @xcite to derive the system outage probability ( op ) , ber , and diversity order .",
    "compared with research on rs in twrc , which shows full diversity is achieved and is frequently available in the literature , research on rs in unidirectional relay networks is still limited .",
    "the study of nc with rs in unidirectional networks is first considered in @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors study the diversity multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) and show that full diversity is achieved .",
    "however , the analysis in @xcite is relied on an unrealistic assumption that unintended packets are available at all destinations , which simplifies the unidirectional networks to twrc .",
    "a generalized dmt analysis is presented in @xcite .",
    "likewise , the authors in @xcite also assume an optimistic assumption that the selected channels are independent , whereas these channels belong to an ordered snr sequence and hence are highly correlated @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the counterpart af relaying in inter - user interference channels are studied in @xcite .",
    "we note that the diversity order in the above - mentioned works is studied via the limit of the upper bound of either op or ber .",
    "furthermore , most of these papers did not consider channel coding , which might be in contrast to practical scenarios in which nodes are usually protected by some forward error correction codes .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the performance of cooperative networks under practical conditions , i.e. , the transmitted signals are protected by convolutional codes ( cc ) . in the considered system ,",
    "two sources communicate with a common destination with the aid of multiple available relays .",
    "this scenario can find applications in uplinks cellular mobile systems where two mobile users try to send data to the base station and some surrounding friendly , idle users can act as the relays . due to the spectral efficiency constraint and processing delay limit",
    ", it is assumed that only one timeslot is dedicated for cooperation .",
    "the best rs is employed @xcite to effectively exploit the spatial diversity .",
    "for low - complexity functions at the relays , demodulate - and - forward ( dmf ) relaying protocol @xcite is used . at the destination , cooperative maximal ratio combining ( c - mrc ) detector @xcite",
    "is used priori to channel decoding to avoid error propagation .",
    "it is worth to note that c - mrc is a suboptimal detector and provides full diversity gain and a performance close to maximum likelihood ( ml ) receiver @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the paper are as follows :    * firstly , we investigate the performance of network coding based cooperation ( ncc ) in which one selected relay helps two sources by applying network coding on the estimated codewords .",
    "closed - form expression of the ber is derived for all sources . from the analyzed ber",
    ", we analytically show that ncc always achieves a diversity of order two regardless the channel code and the total number of relays .",
    "this result coincides with the diversity order derived from op analysis @xcite . *",
    "secondly , we propose a novel relaying scheme named partial relaying based cooperation ( parc ) .",
    "the key difference between parc and ncc is that in the former two relays are selected for cooperation , each helping one source .",
    "due to the spectral efficiency constraint , each selected relay in parc forwards half of the estimated codeword to the destination .",
    "the cooperation based on partial relaying has been studied by some authors in @xcite .",
    "compared with these works , our proposed scheme has two main differences : i ) we investigate the system via ber analysis , whereas these papers study the system through op , which is fundamentally different from our method ; and ii ) the proposed parc employs rs to improve the spectral efficiency , while these papers do not . *",
    "thirdly , insightful theoretical analysis is provided for parc in finite snr regime . particularly , closed - form expression for ber and the diversity order",
    "are derived , which reveals that the _ instantaneous _ diversity order of parc is a function of the operating snr and the minimum distance of the channel code ] .",
    "more importantly , parc can achieve full diversity order with suitable channel codes in low and mediate snr regime , the operating snr region in practical systems .",
    "intensive simulation results show a large snr gain of parc over ncc and other reference schemes .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "section  [ sec : selection ] provides details for the relay selection process .",

    "the system under consideration consists of two sources denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 relays denoted by @xmath3 with @xmath4 , and one destination denoted by d. all nodes are equipped with a half - duplex single antenna .",
    "the system is assumed to operate on orthogonal channels with perfect time synchronization . as a result",
    ", a cooperation period is divided into two phases : broadcast phase and relaying phase . due to the spectral efficiency constraint and processing time limit , we assume that only one time slot is dedicated for relaying .",
    "all the channels are subject to block rayleigh fading plus additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . in order to minimize the computation at the relays , demodulate - and - forward ( dmf ) relaying protocol",
    "is used . to effectively exploit spatial diversity and to achieve high spectral efficiency , relay selection",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "the relay selection process is performed at the beginning of every cooperation period and will be described in details in section  [ sec : selection ] .      motivated by our previous work which showed full diversity gain",
    "is achieved for three - node relay networks in low and medium snrs even when the relay only forward parts of the codeword @xcite , we propose to combine relay selection and partial relaying . in the proposed parc",
    ", two relays are selected in which each is the best relay for one source .",
    "since two relays are active in the relaying phase , each relay only occupies half of relaying time slot , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel]a . consequently , the selected relay can only forward half of the estimated codeword to the destination .",
    "although forwarding half of the estimated codeword , full diversity gain in finite snrs is expected when suitable channel code is employed , as shown later on in section  [ sec : performanceparc ] .",
    "first , source @xmath5 , encodes a @xmath6-length data message @xmath7 into a codeword @xmath8 which contains @xmath9 coded symbols by a convolutional code @xmath10 with code rate @xmath11 .",
    "the codeword @xmath8 is then modulated into a signal @xmath12 .",
    "next , the signal @xmath12 is broadcasted to the relays and the destination .",
    "denote @xmath13 as the selected relays for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the received signal at the destination and the selected relays at the end of first phase are given as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 with @xmath16 is the average received power at node @xmath17 from node @xmath18 , including the path loss ; @xmath19 is the channel fading coefficient between @xmath18 and @xmath17 , which is a complex gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance , i.e. , @xmath20 , and is mutually independent among @xmath21 channels ; @xmath22 is a noise vector whose components are gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath23 .    at the end of the first phase , the selected relay estimates the source coded symbols and forwards them to the destination . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "the selected relay @xmath24 uses half of the relaying time slot to forward half of the codeword @xmath8 to the destination .",
    "more specifically , the selected relay @xmath25 first estimates @xmath26 source coded symbols to form an estimated punctured codeword @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the largest integer less than @xmath29 , and @xmath30 being the set of indexes of the symbols which are helped by the relay @xmath25 . the index set @xmath31 are determined randomly , e.g. , optimal index set , can be employed , but are beyond the scope of this paper . ] .",
    "the source coded symbols at the relay are estimated by the ml detector as follows : @xmath32 @xmath33 , where @xmath34 being the corresponding modulated symbol of @xmath35 .",
    "next , @xmath25 modulates @xmath36 into the modulated signal @xmath37 and then forwards it along with the index set @xmath31 to the destination .",
    "the cost for conveying the index set is negligible since it can send , e.g. , the seed of the random interleaver , to the destination .",
    "the received signal at the destination transmitted from the relay is given as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the channel coefficient from @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is a noise vector whose components are gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath23 .",
    "after receiving two signals from the source and the relay , the destination starts the decoding process with two consecutive steps : demodulating and decoding . assuming that the csi of all channels , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath40 channels , are available at the destination , the destination first applies the c - mrc detector @xcite to demodulate the coded bits for source @xmath5 , as follows : @xmath43 where the detection metric @xmath44 if @xmath45 ; otherwise @xmath46 in , @xmath47 is the parameter of the c - mrc detector which is computed as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 being the instantaneous snr of the channel @xmath50 .",
    "the c - mrc detector then computes log - likelihood ratio values of the coded bits and sends them to the channel decoder .",
    "finally , the channel decoder applies the bcjr algorithm @xcite to decode the transmitted data .    in our protocol",
    ", the selected relay always forwards the estimated symbols to the destination . fortunately , possible decoding error in @xmath51 , hence error propagation , is effectively mitigated by @xmath47 in c - mrc .",
    "for example , if the source - relay channel is too noisy , i.e. , @xmath52 is too small , it is highly probable that @xmath25 decodes with errors . in this case , however , @xmath53 is small and the contribution of the relayed signal is negligible .      in ncc ,",
    "the relays use network coding to help both sources simultaneously to improve the spectral efficiency .",
    "one cooperation in ncc is also divided into two phases : broadcast phase and relaying phase .",
    "the broadcast phase is similar to that in parc , whereas in the relaying phase , only one best relay is active .",
    "time allocation of ncc is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : systemmodel]b .",
    "unlike parc , the selected relay in ncc forwards the whole network - coded codeword to the destination . without loss of generality , denote by @xmath54 the selected relay in ncc .",
    "the received signal at @xmath54 is given as follows : @xmath55 at the end of the first phase , @xmath54 decodes the estimate @xmath56 of @xmath57 , using the ml detector as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath59 being the corresponding modulated symbol of @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath54 performs network encoding to get @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 denotes the binary xor operation .",

    ", we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe in details the relay selection processes for parc and ncc and provide essential characteristics of the selected relay channels .",
    "the relay selection is based on the suboptimal max - min criterion that maximizes the worst end - to - end snr and reduces computational complexity @xcite .",
    "the relay selection process in parc is executed for each source separately and can be done in distributed manner similar to @xcite .",
    "after the channel estimation , the relays set a timer that is inversely proportional to their channel gain .",
    "the first relay whose timer is zero will send a pulse to the destination . upon receiving the pulse",

    "also the decoding at the destination is executed separately for each source .",
    "the relay selection process is performed in ncc based on a criterion that minimize possible error of network - coded symbols .",
    "because an error of the network - coded signal can result from either source - relay links or relay - destination link , the network - coded symbols can be seen as if it has been transmitted via an equivalent channel which yields the same error probability @xcite . using the equivalent error probability for network - coded symbols ,",
    "the two - hop source - relay - destination channel corresponding to the relay @xmath86 can be tightly modeled as follows @xcite : @xmath87 because @xmath88 , and @xmath74 are exponential random variables , it is straightforward to show that @xmath89 is also an exponential random variable whose mean @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 the best relay in ncc , denoted by @xmath54 , is selected by the max - min criterion as : @xmath92 the equivalent network - coded channel of the selected relay is chosen as follows : @xmath93 because the @xmath89 are mutually independent , the cumulative density function ( cdf ) of @xmath94 is computed as : @xmath95 . taking the derivative of @xmath96 we obtain the pdf of @xmath94 expressed in the simplified form as follows : @xmath97 where @xmath98 the mgf of @xmath94 is calculated as follows : @xmath99",

    ", we drop source subscript . after two phases , the destination receives two signal from @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the selected relay .",
    "the combined signal at the output of c - mrc detector can be classified into two groups : the first group consists of symbols which are helped by the selected relay , and the second group includes the rest symbols which are not relayed .",
    "in other words , the received signal at the destination can be seen as an output of block fading channel with 2 blocks : one block consisting of @xmath100 symbols only sees the channel @xmath101 , and the other one which contains @xmath102 symbols sees both channel @xmath101 and channel @xmath81 .",

    "all relays are active and share the relaying phase in two reference schemes . in _ reference 1 _ ,",
    "since the relays help the sources separately , each relay forwards @xmath192 of the estimated codeword . in _",
    "reference 2 _ , all relays use nc to help the sources and each relay randomly forwards @xmath193 of the network - coded codeword .",
    "we note that no relay selection is used in the reference schemes .",
    "figure  [ fig : cc133_165_171 ] compares the performance of parc and referenced schemes for the channel code [ 133 165 171 ] with code rate 1/3 and the minimum distance @xmath194 .",
    "the total number of relays @xmath2 equal to 2 and 3 are plotted .",
    "the observed performance region satisfies @xmath195 because this is the target ber for most practical applications .",
    "it is shown in the figure that the proposed parc achieves an instantaneous diversity order of 3 and 4 ( full diversity order ) in the observing snr range when the total number of relays is 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "such expected result can be explained from theorem  [ theorem:2 ] that in this case , the impact of the diversity one factor equals @xmath196 , which is negligible .",
    "therefore , the diversity order of parc is determined by the full diversity factor in the observing snr region .",
    "in contrast , ncc always achieves a diversity of order 2 , which is a consequence of theorem  [ theorem:4 ] .",
    "a huge snr gain is achieved by parc . in particular",
    ", parc outperforms all other schemes about 5db for @xmath197 and 9db for @xmath198 at ber @xmath199 .",
    "another observation is that reference 1 also surpasses ncc because the relayed symbols in reference 1 see more spatial diversity gain than that in ncc .",
    "when snr tends to infinity , ncc may outperform parc because the diversity order of parc will collapse to one while ncc still has diversity order equal to 2 . from the practical system point of view , this crossing - point might not weaken the advantage of parc over ncc since practical systems usually operate at finite snr regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : cc25_33_37 ] shows the performance comparisons when the channel code [ 25 33 37 ] with rate 1/3 is used .",
    "the minimum distance of this code is equal to 12 .",
    "it is not surprised that ncc always achieves diversity order 2 for both @xmath197 or @xmath198 and the performance of ncc in both cases is similar .",
    "it is observed that parc only achieves full diversity order in low snrs .",
    "more specifically , parc achieves diversity order 3 in the snr range until 10db when @xmath200 and diversity order 4 until snr = 5db when @xmath198 . when snr increases , a degradation in instantaneous diversity order is observed , which is predicted by our analysis ( for this code , the contribution of diversity order one factor approximately is @xmath201 ) . however , a similar snr gain as for strong code [ 133 165 171 ] is achieved by parc at ber of @xmath202 , which is about 5db for @xmath200 and 7db for @xmath198 .",
    "a sound interesting observation is that the performance reference 1 for @xmath198 is worse than that for @xmath197 .",
    "this is because in the later , the relay forwards less symbols in @xmath203 than in @xmath200 case , and the channel code is not strong enough to compensate for less relayed symbols in @xmath198 case @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : codescompare ] compares the performance between parc and ncc for different channel codes and @xmath198 .",
    "three codes with different error correction capabilities are presented : the weak code [ 5 7 5 ] with small minimum distance @xmath204 , the moderate code [ 25 33 37 ] with @xmath205 , and the strong code [ 133 165 171 ] with @xmath206 .",
    "full diversity order is observed in low snrs for all codes .",
    "when snr increases only the strong code achieve full diversity order .",
    "the weak code starts losing diversity order earliest at snr of 5db , while the moderate code s diversity degrades at 10db .",
    "compared with ncc , however , parc significantly outperforms for all codes in the observed snrs .    in conclusion ,",
    "the most effectiveness of the proposed parc is that it can achieve full ( instantaneous ) diversity order in the low and medium snr regime , which in turn results in a large snr gain in finite snr region .",
    "this is crucial for practical systems because their operating snrs is usually finite .",
    "we have proposed a novel cooperative scheme for a two - source multiple - relay networks that combines relay selection and partial relaying to effectively exploit the spatial diversity . in the proposed scheme , the selected relay retransmits half of the estimated codeword in order to satisfy the spectral efficiency constraint .",
    "we have analytically shown that the proposed scheme can gain full diversity order in finite snr regime ( instantaneous diversity ) when a suitable channel code is used .",
    "it has been shown that the instantaneous diversity order is a function of the minimum distance of the code and the operating snr .",
    "numerical results show a significant snr improvement the proposed scheme compared with reference schemes .    the proposed partial relaying cooperation can easily be extended to general networks that consist of multiple sources and a given finite time slots for relaying . in this case",
    ", the selected relays might forward a number of symbols different from half of codeword . a promising application of parc is to design for the sources which have different error correction capacities to achieve a given target ber . as such , how many relayed symbols for a source should be carefully chosen depending on the strength of its channel code .",
    "because the relayed symbols are randomly distributed on the codeword , the weight @xmath120 on the relayed block can have any integer value in @xmath207 $ ] .",
    "denote @xmath208 as the weight pattern in which all @xmath104 weights are not relayed .",
    "then the weight pattern in general has one of two forms , @xmath208 and @xmath209 . using the mgf ,",
    "the upep can be computed for general cases as follows : @xmath210    * * case 1 * : @xmath211 . in this case , all @xmath104 weights locate in the source - destination block , resulting in @xmath212 and @xmath213 . in this case",
    "we have : @xmath214 * * case 2 * : @xmath209 .",
    "there is always @xmath120 weights are relayed , resulting in @xmath215 .",
    "from we have : @xmath216 where @xmath217",
    "the diversity order is defined as the negative exponent of upep in log - scale when the average snr @xmath218 tends to infinity @xmath219 using the upper bound of upep @xcite as @xmath220 and recall we have @xmath221 similar to appendix  [ app : a ] , we consider two cases .    * * case 1 * : @xmath222 .",
    "there is not any symbol helped by the relay and @xmath223 .",
    "the diversity order in this case is given by @xmath224 then the upep has diversity order of 1 when @xmath225 and we can write @xmath226 . * * case 2 * : @xmath209 .",

    "it has shown in @xcite that the best relay selection achieves diversity order is equal to the total number of available relays , we have @xmath231 .",
    "therefore the system diversity order in this case is equal to @xmath141 . in order words , we can write @xmath232 .",
    "combine the two cases above we complete the proof of theorem  [ theorem:2 ] .",
    "it is noted that the total snr in ncc is given by @xmath174 . to derive the upep for ncc , the mgf method is employed .",
    "lemma  [ lemma:1 ] and lemma  [ lemma:2 ] state that there are at least two weights in @xmath233 are non - zero .",

    "we have @xmath246 equals @xmath247 * * case 4 * : @xmath236 . in this case , there are three weights in the total snr , resulting in @xmath248 .",
