    "the growth of networks , which is often a self - organization process , produces a number of intriguing effects @xcite .",
    "very recently , it was found that the percolation transition in growing networks is of a quite different nature than in equilibrium ones @xcite .",
    "( note that the notions of percolation and a giant connected component are meaningful only in the large network limit . ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the growing network with an exponential degree distribution ( degree is the number of connections of a vertex ) , it was found numerically that this transition is of an infinite order .",
    "all the derivatives of the size of the giant connected component ( the percolating cluster ) are zero at the percolation threshold .    here",
    "we propose a theory of the anomalous percolation transition in growing networks including the most interesting and important growing scale - free networks .",
    "also , as a particular case , the exponential growing networks are considered .",
    "thus , we present the complete exact description of the percolation transition both for the scale - free and exponential growing networks .",
    "these cases have been turned to be similar to each other , and the phase transition is of an infinite order .",
    "furthermore , we show that _ in the entire phase without the giant connected component such growing networks are in a `` critical state''_. in this state , the probability @xmath6 that a randomly chosen vertex belongs to a connected component of the size @xmath7 is of a power - law form .",

    "all the results of secs .",
    "[ phase ] and [ crit ] were obtained by the explicit formal analysis of the master equations for growing networks .",
    "let us discuss the physical nature of the behavior observed above .    to begin with , let us recall that in networks growing under mechanism of preferential attachment of edges to vertices degree distributions of vertices are of a power - law ( fractal ) form .",
    "this means that such networks self - organize into scale - free structures with the power - law degree distributions while growing .",
    "in fact , they are in a critical state in a wide range of the values of the network parameters .",
    "the growth under mechanism of the preferential attachment produces power - law distributions . in principle , this phenomenon can be called self - organized criticality .    in the present paper , we are interested not in the statistics of vertices but in the statistics of connected components , that is , in the distributions of the number of connections of distinct connected components and the distributions of the number of vertices in them .",
    "new links are being attached to large connected components with higher probability , so that large connected components have a better chance to merge and grow .",
    "this produces the preferential growth of large connected components even in networks where new edges are attached to randomly chosen vertices , that is , in networks without preferential attachment of edges to vertices .",
    "such mechanism of the effective preferential attachment of new vertices to large connected components naturally produces power - law distributions of the sizes of connected components and power - law probabilities @xmath6 .",
    "this `` self - organized critical state '' is realized in the growing networks only if the giant component is absent .",
    "as soon as the giant connected component emerges , the situation changes radically .",
    "a new channel of the evolution of the connected components is coming into play , and , with high probability , large connected components do not grow up to even larger ones but join to the giant component .",
    "therefore , there are few large connected components if the giant component is present , and then @xmath6 is exponential .",
    "thus , in the growing networks , two phases are in contact at the point of the emergence of the giant connected component  the critical phase without the giant component and the normal phase with the giant component .",
    "this contact provides the above observed effects .",
    "there exists another example of a contact of a `` critical phase '' ( or of a line of critical points ) with a normal phase , namely , the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite .",
    "interestingly , functional dependences in both these cases have similar functional forms .",
    "this indicates that equations describing such phase transitions have similar analytical properties .",
    "connections in non - equilibrium networks are very in - homogeneously distributed between vertices .",
    "we mean that many edges are captured by old vertices , and few edges are attached to more young vertices  `` the rich gets richer '' .",
    "nevertheless , this statistically in - homogeneous distribution of connections in growing networks is not the direct origin of the observed behavior .",
    "both this in - homogeneity and the critical ( or , one can say , power - law , or fractal , or scale - free ) distributions of connected components in the absence of the giant component have the same first cause  the specific process of the network growth .",
    "in summary , we have presented the theory of percolation in evolving systems  growing networks .",
    "we have demonstrated that the interplay of a self - organization process and percolation produces a number of intriguing effects in such objects .",
    "we have obtained exact results for the size of the giant component and the distribution of vertices over connected components . an explicit description for the anomalous phase transition of the emergence of the giant component in these growing networks has been proposed .",
    "we hope that our results are of a general nature and can be applied to various growing systems .",
