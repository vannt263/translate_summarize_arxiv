    "present remarkable achievements with coherent manipulation of coupled matter - field states evoke great interest in the investigation of phase transitions in such systems ; see , for example , @xcite . the key role in the behavior of coupled states under consideration",
    "is played by so - called dark and bright polaritons , that is , bosonic quasiparticles representing a linear superposition of photons in an external ( probe ) field and the macroscopic ( coherent ) polarization of a two - level atomic system or excitons localized in quantum wells .",
    "the critical temperature of a phase transition for polaritons can be high enough due to their small effective mass , which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the free mass of atoms ( or electrons ) .",
    "although evidence of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of polaritons in semiconductor microstructures has recently been reported by several groups ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) observation of the high - temperature phase transition remains an unsolved problem . in this sense",
    "atomic systems seem to be more attractive and experimentally feasible for polariton bec purposes @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with polariton condensate observation is connected with the problem of achieving true thermal equilibrium for coupled matter - field states , which is a primary step in studying the phase transitions in the systems under consideration . roughly speaking ,",
    "the polaritonic system for the current experiments with semiconductor microcavities is in nonequilibrium ( or quasiequilibrium ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one mechanism for achieving thermal equilibrium of low - branch polaritons with the host lattice is to cool them with a phonon bath @xcite .",
    "the thermalization time must be shorter than the polariton lifetime in this case .",
    "for the current experiments the lifetime of polaritons is in the picosecond regime and comparable to the thermalization time .    in the area of atomic physics ,",
    "extremely long lifetimes of excitations are readily achieved at present . in this paper",
    "we show that the atomic polariton lifetime is limited by the lifetime of the two - level atomic transition @xmath0 only , that is , by spontaneous emission .",
    "since the value of @xmath0 is in the nanosecond regime the thermalization time can be longer compared with that of polaritons formed in semiconductor devices .",
    "therefore polaritons in an atomic physics system could be preferable for observation of bec , because of the long coherence times achieved .",
    "progress toward the achievement of thermal equilibrium in coupled atom - field states was made by some of us in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ability to thermalize coupled atom - light ( dressed ) states due to frequent collisions of rubidium atoms with buffer gas atoms in the presence of optical irradiation has been demonstrated experimentally . in the literature",
    "this process is called optical collision ( oc ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that redistribution in ocs has also recently allowed laser cooling of ultradense atomic gases @xcite .    in general atomic collisions in the presence of a laser field",
    "can be considered as a scattering ( inelastic ) process when both the internal ( or kinetic ) energy of the particles and the energy of the scattered light are changed .",
    "physically this leads to dephasing of the atomic polarization that determines the broadening of the fluorescence spectrum and introduces an additional ( collisional ) phase shift .",
    "notably , a closed representation to understand the effect of atomic collisions on the resulting width and shape of spectral lines was performed by weisskopf in his famous paper  @xcite .",
    "thereafter collisional broadening has been a subject of intensive investigation both in theory and in experiment ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "various aspects and approaches to line shape description , phase shift , and intensity due to nonresonant atomic collisions have been studied and summarized in @xcite .",
    "notably , important properties of spectral line shift , width , and asymmetry for a wide range of foreign ( buffer ) atomic gas densities in connection with the so - called impact limit of atomic collisions have been discussed by a. royer in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a statistical approach to the oc problem was proposed in  @xcite , based on the cross section of collisionally aided radiative excitation ( or emission ) for two - level atoms coupled to a thermostat of buffer gas .",
    "subsequently , in  @xcite the authors established a simple theory of oc based on the dressed - state approach in the schrdinger picture .",
    "it has been shown that collisions with buffer gas particles reduce to a transfer between different dressed states of the atom .",
    "spectral redistribution of quasiresonant radiation occurring due to collisional relaxation has been a subject of experimental investigations as well ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . the oc spectral line shape is essentially non - lorentzian , that is , asymmetric . from a molecular point of view",
    "such an asymmetry can be understood by taking into account modifications of interaction potential curves  @xcite .",
    "although the main features of ocs have been investigated for a long time , the thermodynamic properties of coupled atom - light systems have not yet been studied fully .",
    "it it is pointed out in  @xcite that , in the limit of a low rabi splitting energy @xmath1 , that is , for @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the temperature of the two - level atomic ensemble ) , the ocs reduce to equalizing dressed - state populations under the secular approximation .",
    "the deviations from the einstein coefficients for absorption and stimulated emission induced by ocs are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of thermalization of coupled atom - field states has not been studied .",
    "standard theoretical approaches in this case are based on the rate equations for the population of dressed states only , completely ignoring coupling between population and atomic coherences at the same time ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "such an approach seems unsuitable if we keep in mind the problem of observation of polariton bec .",
    "actually spontaneous polarization buildup occurs in this case and polariton coherences become important ( cf .",
    "thus , the role of the secular approximation in the thermalization process of coupled atom - light states should be clarified .",
    "the aim of this report is a fundamental theoretical and experimental investigation of the thermalization of coupled atom - field states , taking into account spontaneous emission processes beyond the approximations typically used .    in sec.[secii ]",
    "we establish the model of interaction of two - level atoms with the quantized optical field in the presence of ocs .",
    "realistic ( experimentally accessible ) conditions for oc of rubidium atoms with high - pressure buffer ( argon or helium ) gas atoms are discussed . in sec.[seciii ] the bloch - like equations for density matrix elements in the dressed - state basis are derived .",
    "analysis of the steady - state solutions of these equations is performed in sec.[seciv ] .",
    "we define the time of thermalization and specify necessary conditions to achieve thermal equilibrium for dressed atom - light states . in sec.[intensity ] we derive the properties of intensities of spectral components for an atomic system in the presence of oc under the atom - field thermalization process .",
    "thermalization of coupled atom - light states in an ultrahigh - pressure buffer gas environment is experimentally investigated in sec.[secvi ] .",
    "the spectrum of fluorescence obtained from rubidium atoms is analyzed .",
    "we give an explanation for the observed resonance fluorescence signal and necessary estimations of the time of thermalization according to the theoretical approach developed here . in sec.[secvii ] we summarize our results and discuss further prospects for the experiment and the corresponding theory .",
    "in particular , the possibility of polariton condensation is discussed .",
    "atomic collisions in the presence of a nonresonant radiation field can be considered as the elementary process of a collision between an isolated two - level atom @xmath4 and a foreign ( buffer ) gas atom of sort @xmath5 ; that is , @xmath6 which occurs with simultaneous emission ( or absorption ) of a photon with frequency @xmath7 .",

    ", the atom has some energy excess @xmath14 , which is transferred to the kinetic energy of the atoms after the collision [ fig.[fig1](b ) ] .",
    "note that for both cases excitation of the upper level @xmath15 is impossible due to atomic collision only .",
    "our description of thermalization of atom - field ( dressed ) states developed here is based on the approach to oc presented in  @xcite and generalizes their treatment to detuning of @xmath16 values comparable to or higher than the thermal energy @xmath17 .",
    "the master equation for the density matrix @xmath18 in the presence of both ocs and radiative ( spontaneous ) relaxation processes can be written as follows : @xmath19+\\left\\{\\frac{d\\sigma } { dt } \\right\\}_{rad } + \\left\\{\\frac{d\\sigma } { dt } \\right\\}_{coll } , \\ ] ] where the last two terms account for spontaneous emission and collisions with buffer gas atoms .",

    "the term @xmath28 characterizes the contribution of spontaneous processes in eq.([eq2 ] ) ; @xmath29 is the spontaneous emission rate ( @xmath30 is the natural lifetime of the atomic transition ) .",

    "@xcite ) :    [ eq6 ] @xmath37    where @xmath38   dt$ ] is the phase shift that accumulates during the collision .",
    "more rigorous expressions for collisional broadening @xmath35 can be found using a full quantum mechanical ( microscopic ) approach ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in general , @xmath35 implicitly depends on the atom - field detuning @xmath39 and , thus , on the molecular potentials for a compound system .",
    "for @xmath40 the magnitude of @xmath35 can be inferred from the expression @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the weisskopf radius , depending on the molecular level variation ( shifting ) due to atomic collisions , @xmath43 is the thermal atomic velocity , and @xmath44 is the number density of the buffer gas .    in particular , in the experiment described in sec.[secvi ] , we use rubidium atoms with mass @xmath45 under the temperature @xmath46 and a buffer gas of density @xmath47 .",
    "taking into account typical values of the weisskopf radius @xmath48 for the collisional broadening rate ( [ eq7 ] ) , one can obtain a value of few terahertz .",
    "the average collisional shift @xmath49 can be expressed via molecular level variation under the quantum mechanical description as well .",
    "practically , @xmath50 in ( [ eq6b ] ) has the same order of magnitude as a collisional broadening @xmath35 . in the current experiment we used argon gas as the buffer gas ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) at @xmath53 ( 50  mpa ) pressure and helium as the buffer gas ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) at @xmath56 ( 40  mpa ) , respectively .",
    "the spontaneous emission rate for experimentally utilized rubidium atom d lines is @xmath57  mhz ( @xmath58  ns ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , condition @xmath59 is held in the experiment under discussion .",
    "nevertheless as we will see , spontaneous emission plays an essential role in the thermalization process of coupled atom - light states due to its ability to change the population of the excited atomic level .    note",
    "that the doppler effect is not important for the problem under consideration .",
    "first , the motion of the atoms can not change the population of atomic levels and , thus , can not restrict the thermalization process .",
    "second , doppler broadening ( of the order of a gigahertz ) is significantly smaller than the collisional broadening in the experiment , thus neglecting the doppler broadening in our calculations is justified .",
    "let us now consider the situation when each collision happens in a short enough time span @xmath60 . in this case",
    "two collisions are well separated in time ; that is , we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the time interval separating two collisions . here",
    "we neglect temporal correlations between the spontaneous emission process and the collisional one . loosely speaking spontaneous emission and oc optical collision processes",
    "are well separated in time as well .",

    "the applicability of our model in this case is discussed later .",

    "this also yields an enhancement of the field amplitude , which can allow full thermalization of coupled atom - light states in the high - pressure buffer gas system .",

    "<S> the interaction of a two - level atomic ensemble with a quantized single - mode electromagnetic field in the presence of optical collisions is investigated both theoretically and experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the main focus is on achieving thermal equilibrium for coupled atom - light states ( in particular dressed states ) . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a model of atomic dressed - state thermalization that accounts for the evolution of the pseudo - spin bloch vector components and characterize the essential role of the spontaneous emission rate in the thermalization process . </S>",
    "<S> our model shows that the time of thermalization of the coupled atom - light states depends strictly on the ratio of the detuning to the resonant rabi frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted time of thermalization is in the nanosecond domain at full optical power and about 10 times shorter than the natural lifetime in our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally we investigate the interaction of the optical field with rubidium atoms in an ultrahigh - pressure buffer gas cell under the conditions of large atom - field detuning comparable to the thermal energy in frequency units . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an observed asymmetry of the saturated lineshape is interpreted as evidence of thermal equilibrium of coupled atom - light states . </S>"
