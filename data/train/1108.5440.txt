    "<S> the fluid is directly transformed into highly ordered crystallites .    </S>",
    "<S> when a supersaturated fluid crystallizes , crystallization is usually induced by the container walls , rather than to proceed from a fluctuation in the bulk of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , called heterogeneous nucleation , is of fundamental importance for the kinetics of phase transitions ( such as the formation of ice in the supersaturated vapor of clouds ) , as well as for technological applications , in which the properties of the walls can be designed to influence the properties of the crystals that are formed . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we discuss heterogeneous crystal nucleation and growth from the overcompressed fluid of hard spheres .    </S>",
    "<S> hard spheres have served successfully as a simple model system for fluids and crystals over the past fifty years . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energy between two hard spheres is either infinite ( if they overlap ) or zero ( if they do not overlap ) , thus the phase behavior of the model is purely determined by entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of the potential makes hard spheres particularly suited for computer simulations ; and the entropic nature of the phase transition makes them a useful limit case for comparison to other systems , which are governed by an interplay between entropy and enthalpy .    </S>",
    "<S> hard spheres are not only of interest to the theoretician , they are also often synthesized on the colloidal scale and used in experiments on fundamental questions of statistical mechanics ( see e.  g.  @xcite and references therein ) .    as the topic of our work , crystallization of hard spheres on a substrate , </S>",

    "<S> the supersaturated fluid of hard spheres in contact with a planar hard wall has been addressed in computer simulation studies by dijkstra @xcite , auer @xcite and volkov @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies show that the planar hard wall is wet by the crystalline phase , hence crystallization proceeds layer by layer rather than by the nucleation of crystallites . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a review on wetting and film growth of crystalline phases on structured and unstructured surfaces in various systems , including hard spheres , see the article by esztermann and lwen @xcite . ) also the recent experimental and simulation work by sandomirski and co - workers @xcite dealt with the growth of a crystalline film in contact with a wall . here the wall was not planar but a fcc layer of spheres . </S>",
    "<S> the authors found that the speed of the crystallization front depends non - monotonically on the packing fraction of the fluid and that a depletion zone is present in front of the growing crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> heterogeneous nucleation of hard sphere crystals has mainly been addressed in the context of template - induced crystallization . </S>",
    "<S> van blaaderen and co - workers @xcite showed how to design structured templates to induce the epitaxial growth of large monocrystals and of metastable phases in a sedimenting liquid of hard spheres . </S>",
    "<S> cacciuto and frenkel studied the effect of finite templates of various sizes and lattice structures on crystallite formation by means of computer simulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently this topic was taken up again and investigated in more detail experimentally and theoretically by the groups of dijkstra and van blaaderen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for small two - dimensional seeds of triangular as well as square symmetry they find that nucleation barriers depend on the seed s symmetry as well as the lattice spacing . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is due to defects and changes in crystal morphology that are induced by the seed .    </S>",
    "<S> heterogeneous nucleation of hard spheres on an infinite substrate has recently been addressed by xu and co - workers @xcite in a computer simulation study . in this </S>",
    "<S> work triangular and square substrates as well as a hcp(1100 ) pattern were brought in contact with a strongly overcompressed fluid , and the evolution of the density profile perpendicular to the substrate as well as the fraction of crystalline particles were monitored . a metastable bcc - phase that was stabilized for long times was observed .    </S>",
    "<S> here we present an extended simulation study of crystallization mechanisms and rates for a fluid of hard spheres brought in contact with a triangular substrate for varying overcompression and lattice distortion . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> there is no systematic study on the effect that distortion of an infinite substrate lattice has on the crystallization mechanism and rate of hard spheres .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to close this brief overview by pointing out that there are other useful model systems for crystal nucleation , as e.  g.  complex plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to colloidal systems microscopic dynamics in complex plasmas are almost undamped , @xcite hence they offer a complementary experimental approach to the topic . </S>"
