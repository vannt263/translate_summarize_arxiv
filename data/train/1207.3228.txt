    "waves on ocean surface are the most common example of wave turbulence .",
    "wave turbulence studies the statistical properties of a set of interacting waves where energy is transferred by nonlinear interactions from the forcing scales down to small scales at which energy is dissipated .",
    "a statistical theory of wave turbulence was developed in the 60 s , the so - called weak turbulence theory which exhibits such an energy transfer in out - of - equilibrium situations @xcite .",
    "this theory has been applied to almost every context involving nonlinear waves : astrophysical plasmas , surface or internal waves in oceanography , rossby waves in the atmosphere , spin waves in magnetic materials , kelvin wave in superfluid turbulence , nonlinear optics , etc .",
    "this theory is based on hypothesis such as weakly nonlinear waves , infinite systems and scale separations between energy source and sink , which may limit its applicability to real systems . in the last decade , the stationary regime of wave turbulence has been studied in laboratory experiments ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , and have shown that the validity domain of this theory can be questionable .",
    "non - stationary wave turbulence , i.e. once the forcing is stopped from a stationary state of wave turbulence , has been much less study although it can provide crucial informations to understand how energy is redistributed between modes during transients ( e.g. during a sudden change of wind for ocean waves ) , and how stationary regime of wave turbulence is reached .",
    "numerous studies have been performed on non - stationary turbulent systems such as three - dimensional turbulence in wind tunnel @xcite , in rotating tanks @xcite , and two - dimensional turbulence in : plasma @xcite , soap films @xcite and in shallow water @xcite , as well as in quantum turbulence @xcite . for non - stationary wave turbulence , theoretical @xcite and numerical @xcite efforts",
    "have been performed , whereas experiments are scarce and only concern capillary wave turbulence @xcite , or elastic wave turbulence on a thin plate @xcite . for elastic waves ,",
    "better agreement with weak turbulence theory has been obtained compared to the stationary case where the forcing induces anisotropy @xcite . for the decay of capillary wave turbulence ,",
    "theoretical works have predicted a self - similar solution in time for the energy spectrum @xcite that is compatible with the observations on decaying capillary wave turbulence on the surface of liquid hydrogen @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on an experimental study of freely decaying gravity - capillary wave turbulence on the surface of various fluids .",
    "the frequency spectrum of the capillary wave amplitude is found to be self - similar during most of the decay .",
    "the spectrum exponent of this non - stationary regime is found to be close to the predicted exponent of the stationary regime .",
    "moreover , the energy within the system and all the fourier modes are found to decay exponentially with time .",
    "this is unusual in decaying turbulent systems where energy is supposed to decay as a power law in time @xcite .",
    "the longest waves present in the system are the most energetic ones and are shown to be damped by viscosity on the surface , with the inextensible film condition @xcite .",
    "however , these latter keep enough energy during the decay to sustain capillary waves in a wave turbulent regime without gravity wave turbulence .",
    "the amplitude of the capillary spectrum and its cut - off frequency are found to decrease as two different power laws of the total energy contained in the system .",
    "finally , freely decaying capillary wave turbulence can be seen as a capillary wave turbulence in a stationary regime but with a decreasing total energy and a decreasing inertial range with time .",

    "finally , additional experiments in the stationary case are presented in appendix in order to compare stationary and non- stationary regimes .",
    "the experimental setup is close to the one used in  @xcite .",
    "it consists of a circular plastic vessel , 22 cm in diameter , filled either with mercury or water to a height @xmath0 mm .",

    "surface waves are generated by a rectangular plunging wave maker ( 13  cm in length and 3.5 cm in height ) driven by an electromagnetic vibration exciter driven by a random noise ( in amplitude and frequency ) band - pass filtered typically between 0.1 and 5 hz .",

    "one can estimate that roughly 70% of the total energy is contained in frequencies between 3 and 4 hz during all the decay . as a consequence , long waves close to these modes play the role of an energy source that feed the capillary cascade during the decay , and the relaxation of these modes characterize the global decay of the system .",
    "the energy decay of these long waves leads to a decrease of the inertial range of the capillary wave turbulence ( see figs .",

    "the typical time @xmath125 of this fast damping could be a measurement of the nonlinear time scale of gravity waves and is found to be smaller than the damping time @xmath40 .",

    "the gravity power law spectrum is no longer observed , meaning that there is not enough energy to sustain the gravity wave cascade anymore .",

    "this behavior is expected when non interacting waves are dissipated by viscosity . as a consequence , decaying capillary wave turbulence is not observed within these fluids because the nonlinear interactions are too weak with respect to the dissipation process .",

    "viscous damping in fluids can have different origins : bottom boundary layer ( @xmath128 ) , side wall boundary layer ( @xmath129 ) , and surface dissipation .",
    "two types of viscous dissipation by the surface are generally considered : either due to the fluid viscosity at the surface @xmath130 @xcite , or due to a surface boundary layer with an inextensible film @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "the latter comes from the presence of surfactants / contaminants at the interface that leads to an inextensible surface where fluid velocity should be cancelled at the interface .",

    "clearly , the experimental decay rate scales as @xmath139 over two decades in viscosity and not as @xmath140 as expected by usual viscous dissipation . in our experiment ,",
    "viscous dissipations by surface boundary layer and bottom boundary layer are the most important while the usual viscous dissipation at the surface is clearly negligible in the damping of the fundamental mode .",
    "friction at the lateral boundary is also negligible .",
    "bottom friction is quite important since the wavelength corresponding to @xmath71 is close to the vessel radius @xmath8 ( and thus of the order of @xmath141 ) ; so waves at this frequency are affected by the depth .",
    "finally , the total theoretical dissipation @xmath142 is found in good agreement with data both qualitatively and quantitatively ( see dashed line in fig .  [ drate ] ) .",
    "the fact that viscous dissipation by a surface boundary layer takes over the usual viscous relaxation was previously observed in laboratory experiments with water @xcite , and is also realistic considering waves in a natural context .",
    "indeed , if no particular attention is paid ( such as working in clean room , filtered fluid or fluid with low enough surface tension ) , the surface dissipation by boundary layer dominates the @xmath143 dissipation @xcite . finally , note that the infinite depth condition is satisfied for @xmath144 hz ( i.e. @xmath145 cm and @xmath146 ) , and thus bottom friction becomes also negligible for capillary waves .",

    "a large amount of the total energy within the system is contained in few longest wave modes ( fundamental vessel eigenvalues ) which also decay exponentially in time due to viscous dissipation within a surface boundary layer . since a self - similar capillary wave cascade is observed in time , it means that the typical time of energy flux transfer through scales by nonlinear interactions is small with respect to the natural damping time of the waves .",
    "such a self - similar cascade during the decay of capillary wave turbulence has been predicted theoretically @xcite .",

    "our wave turbulence system thus exhibits a unusual behavior where a turbulent cascade regime is observed with a total energy decaying exponentially in time as a result of the viscous decay of the longest wave modes .",
    "it can be interpreted as follows : the energy necessary to sustain the capillary wave turbulence is small with respect to the energy contained in the longest modes that feed the capillary cascade .",
