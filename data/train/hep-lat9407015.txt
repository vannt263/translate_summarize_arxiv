    "<S> is made employing the charmonium @xmath1 mass splitting calculated on full qcd configurations generated with two flavors of dynamical kogut - susskind quarks to fix the scale .    </S>",

    "<S> + @xmath3 presently at _ theory group , fermi national accelerator laboratory , + batavia , il 60510 , u. s. a. _ +    a distinctive feature of qcd that differentiates it from phenomenological quark models of hadrons is the existence of sea quarks built into the theory . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , finding a physical manifestation of sea quark effects has been an elusive subject in full lattice qcd simulations . in hadron mass spectrum calculations , for example , full qcd results for flavor non - singlet hadron masses agree with those of quenched qcd within statistical errors of 510% if the bare coupling constant for the latter is shifted by an appropriate amount@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar situation holds for the critical coupling of the chiral transition at finite temperatures in full qcd ; its value , though largely dependent on the sea quark mass , is reproduced quite well from that of the pure gauge theory by correcting for quark one - loop vacuum polarization effects@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible interpretation of the matching of full and quenched qcd by a shift of the bare coupling is that the shift represents an adjustment of the renormalized coupling constant at the low energy scale that dominates the behavior of quantities being simulated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if this interpretation is valid , one expects that sea quark effects will become manifest in the renormalized coupling constant estimated for a scale sufficiently large compared to the dominant scale , since the full qcd coupling constant decreases more slowly than that of the pure gauge theory . in this article we present evidence that this in fact is the case </S>",
    "<S> : we find that the full qcd coupling constant extracted from two - flavor full qcd simulations is consistently larger than that of quenched qcd at large momenta ranging over @xmath4gev when the scale is determined from the @xmath5 meson mass ; the difference in the magnitude of the full and quenched coupling constants is consistent with the picture that the two couplings merge when evolved down to the low energy scale @xmath6gev via the two - loop renormalization group . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the physical strong coupling constant for five flavors @xmath7 at the @xmath8 scale following the work of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite employing the @xmath1 mass splitting of charmonium states estimated for two - flavor full qcd </S>",
    "<S> .    calculation of the renormalized value of the coupling for a bare value @xmath9 taken in a simulation is facilitated by the recent study@xcite which has shown that lattice perturbative series is well convergent after lattice gluon tadpole effects are properly taken into account . a proposal for including tadpole effects in the relation between the bare and renormalized coupling </S>",
    "<S> is given by@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the plaquette expectation value , @xmath12 is the gluon one - loop contribution@xcite , and the last term represents the contribution of @xmath13 flavors of quarks with @xmath14 for the kogut - susskind quark action@xcite and @xmath15 for the wilson action@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively one may use the @xmath16 coupling defined from the static @xmath17 potential , which can be estimated from @xmath11 via@xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the kogut - susskind quark action and @xmath21 for the wilson action . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the two couplings are given by@xcite @xmath22 equivalently the @xmath23 parameters are related by @xmath24 with @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized coupling constant in the @xmath26 scheme extracted from ( [ eq : msbar ] ) for quenched and two - flavor full qcd are compared in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] for kogut - susskind and wilson quark actions as a function of scale @xmath27 determined from the @xmath5 meson mass . in full </S>",
    "<S> qcd the plaquette data are extrapolated linearly in the sea quark mass to @xmath28 . in quenched qcd </S>",
    "<S> we made a ninth order polynomial fit in @xmath29 of plaquette values published in the literature@xcite in order to calculate the values at @xmath29 where data are not available . </S>",
    "<S> the trend is apparent in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] that the full qcd coupling constant is systematically larger than that of the pure gauge theory when compared at the same scale @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] illustrates the two - loop renormalization group evolution of the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> deviation of @xmath31 from the solid lines toward smaller values of cutoff is in part ascribed to scaling violation effects due to a finite lattice spacing and in part to uncertainties of @xmath32 in the relation ( [ eq : msbar ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can estimate the magnitude of the latter through a comparison of the coupling constant extracted from ( [ eq : msbar ] ) and ( [ eq : v ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis shows that the latter estimate yields values for @xmath31 larger by about 35% at @xmath33gev , and by about 510% at @xmath34gev . </S>",
    "<S> this is taken as uncertainties of our analyses .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] we compare the two - loop renormalization group evolution of the full and quenched coupling constants toward small momenta @xmath35gev . the upper and lower edges of the bands in this figure correspond to @xmath31 estimated from the relation ( [ eq : msbar ] ) and that from ( [ eq : v ] ) including scale errors in order to take into consideration the two - loop uncertainty . for full qcd </S>",
    "<S> we employ the data taken at the highest @xmath29 for the starting value , and for quenched qcd the one carried out at a value of @xmath29 with a nearby value of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the evolution of the two coupling constants overlaps below @xmath36gev , which is the dominant scale relevant for the @xmath5 meson that is employed for fixing the scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the results described above are fully consistent with the view that matching full and quenched results means adjusting the coupling constant at the relevant low energy scale , and that the full qcd couplings estimated for larger momenta should exhibit a slower decrease than the pure gauge coupling with a rate dictated by the renormalization group @xmath29 function .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note that these findings provide support for the procedure of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for estimating the physical strong coupling constant from values measured in simulations with an incomplete spectrum of sea quarks . </S>",
    "<S> namely one initially evolves the measured value at the cutoff scale down to the low energy scale @xmath37 typical of the simulated hadron system using the flavor number of the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the physical coupling constant @xmath38 at that scale is equated to the evolved value , and @xmath38 for larger scale is calculated through renormalization group incorporating the full spectrum of quarks active at each scale . </S>",
    "<S> a necessary condition for applying this procedure is that the scale @xmath37 is not too small in order not to spoil the two - loop approximation to the @xmath29 function that breaks down for small momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed to use the @xmath1 charmonium mass splitting for which potential models suggest @xmath39gev . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage is that heavy quark propagators are easy to calculate and that the @xmath1 mass splitting is empirically insensitive to the quark mass , rendering its fine tuning unnecessary .    </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out an analysis along this line employing the full qcd configurations on a @xmath40 for two flavors of dynamical kogut - susskind quarks at @xmath41 with @xmath42@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for charmonium spectrum measurement we used the wilson quark action for valence quarks@xcite , employing gaussian smeared sources @xmath43 and local sinks @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and also @xmath52 , @xmath53 with @xmath54 for @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed 72 configurations at @xmath56 and 75 configurations at @xmath57 with the lattice size periodically doubled in the temporal direction .    in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ tabletwo ] we list our result for the charmonium spectrum and the corresponding scale @xmath58 extracted from the experimental value of the @xmath59 mass splitting 457.8(5)mev@xcite as input . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting is almost independent of the hopping parameter @xmath60 which controls the charm quark mass , though it slightly depends on the choice of the operator for @xmath61 ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) . the splitting yields a value @xmath64gev , which is consistent with </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 @xcite estimated from the @xmath5 meson mass .    </S>",
    "<S> our results for the physical strong coupling constant and the @xmath23 parameter obtained with the scale listed in table  [ tabletwo ] are summarized in table  [ tablefour ] . in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ tablefour](a ) the starting value is @xmath66 estimated from ( [ eq : msbar ] ) , while in table  [ tablefour](b ) we use @xmath67 obtained from ( [ eq : v ] ) . for both cases the actual evolution </S>",
    "<S> is made in terms of the @xmath16 coupling since it is directly related to the heavy quark potential relevant for charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath68 gev and 0.75 gev for the matching scale and take an average of the two choices for the central value for the strong coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the errors are estimated by allowing @xmath37 to vary over the range @xmath69gev and the scale @xmath58 within the quoted error .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with the previous lattice estimates carried out in quenched qcd@xcite . compared to the world average of phenomenological determinations @xmath70@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the results are somewhat small especially for those estimated from the relation ( [ eq : msbar ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not view the difference to be alarming at this stage since there exists a 5% uncertainty in our value of @xmath0 due to that of the input value at the cutoff scale , and an additional 5% that results from the matching procedure , as well as errors in the experimental value .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , our analyses have shown that sea quark effects of a magnitude expected from renormalization group considerations are visible in the strong coupling constant measured in current full qcd simulations incorporating up and down quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a promising prospect for a realistic determination of the strong coupling constant including the full spectrum of sea quarks since incorporating heavy quarks such as strange and charm is not difficult from the view of the necessary computer power compared to that for light quarks . </S>"
