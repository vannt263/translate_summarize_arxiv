    "the overwhelming majority of stars in the universe display absorption lines in their visible range spectrum .",
    "emission lines in stellar spectra are therefore notable exceptions which betray fascinating properties such as the presence of unusually strong chromospheric activity , rapid rotation or in the case of interest to this paper , strong mass loss and high luminosity .",
    "nearby giant h  ii regions are hosts to an interesting zoo of emission - line objects ( walborn & fitzpatrick 2000 ) , most of them being post - main sequence massive stars of notable interest for our understanding of stellar evolution at the top end of the initial mass function .",
    "they also offer important testbeds to understand the more distant , unresolved starbursts : individual stars can be counted and spectroscopically classified , allowing a direct comparison with the modelisation of the spatially integrated properties of their ionizing cluster ( see vacca et al .",
    "1995 for such a comparison in 30 doradus , or bruhweiler , miskey & smith neubig 2003 in ngc 604 ) . among massive stars with emission lines ,",
    "those of wolf - rayet ( wr ) type are the easiest to detect and classify because of their strong and broad emission lines in the visible part of the spectrum .",
    "thanks to surveys in local group galaxies ( massey & johnson 1998 ) and improvements in theoretical models ( meynet & maeder 2005 ) , the evolutionary status of wr stars is now understood well enough to use them as diagnostics to infer the properties of starburst regions .",
    "for instance , in unresolved clusters or starburst knots of distant galaxies , the equivalent width of the ` wr - bumps ' are good indicators of the age and upper mass limit of the stellar population ( pindao et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the small spiral galaxy m33 is host to four giant hii regions bright enough to have their own ngc number : ngc 604 , the second most luminous starburst cluster in the local group ; then , in decrasing order of h@xmath0 luminosity , ngc 595 , ngc 592 and ngc 588 . despite their different galactocentric distances ,",
    "these four regions have very similar metallicities , with @xmath1 log o / h @xmath2 ( magrini et al .",
    "two papers published in the fall of 1981 presented the spectroscopic discovery of wr stars in these clusters : dodorico & rosa ( 1981 ) derived a surprisingly large ( 50 ) number of wr stars in ngc 604 , while conti & massey ( 1981 ) noticed that some wr stars in the four regions were excedingly luminous .",
    "both studies however suffered from a lack of spatial resolution .",
    "more wr candidates were identified by interference filter imagery ( taking advantage of their strong heii emission ) and spectroscopically confirmed by massey & conti ( 1983 ) , armandroff & massey ( 1985 , 1991 ) and massey , conti & armandroff ( 1987 ) .",
    "the most detailed catalogue of wr stars ( with spectral classification ) and wr candidates in m33 is presented in massey & johnson ( 1998 ) .",
    "drissen , moffat & shara ( 1990 , 1993 ) identified more wr candidates based on high resolution ccd images with interference filters ; but until now however , none of these were spectroscopically confirmed .    in the first paper ( abbott et al .",
    "2004 ) of this series dedicated to wr stars in m33 , we presented new spectra of one of , 14 wn , one transition - type wn / wc and 26 wc stars in the field of m33 . in this second paper , we present spectra of known wr stars and most of the wr candidates in the giant hii regions ngc 604 , ngc 595 and ngc 592 .",
    "the spectroscopic data were obtained with the multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) attached to the 3.6-m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) in 2000 september and 2001 october .",
    "prior to spectroscopy , a high quality image of each region was obtained in order to identify the targets and position the slitlets with sub - acrsecond accuracy .",
    "the seeing during both observing runs ranged from 0.7@xmath3 to 1.0@xmath3 , except when the observations of ngc 592 were obtained ( 1.5@xmath3 at high air mass ; see below ) .",
    "after the spectra were obtained , a superposition of these images with the resulting 2d spectral images ensured a correct _ a - posteriori _ identification of the stars .",
    "we used the b600 grating , which , combined with the slit width of 1.5 arcsec , provided a spectral resolution of @xmath4  .",
    "exposure times were 900s for ngc 592 , 2700s for ngc 604 and 2700s for ngc 595 . in the case of ngc 592 , the observations were obtained at the end of the night with a long and wide ( 5@xmath3 ) slit , which reduced the spectral resolution .",
    "the data were then reduced using standard procedures in iraf .    to complement these spectroscopic observations ,",
    "we have used archival images obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ to correctly identify emission - line stars in all regions.table 1 lists the names and properties of the imaging datasets that we have used for this research .",

    "( 2003 ) were able to derive the spectral type of 40 stars in the central region of ngc 604 based on ultraviolet spectral imagery with hst s imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "uv spectroscopic classification is not hampered by the very strong nebular emission lines present in the visible region ; this survey is therefore the most complete stellar census so far in this cluster .",
    "we now describe the spectra of the newly observed stars .",
    "wr5 was first identified as a wr by conti & massey ( 1981 ) , but their spectrogram also included neighboring wr4 and wr3 ; it was thus classified as a wn star . however , drissen , moffat & shara ( 1990 ) tentatively classified it as wc based on their narrow - band photometry .",
    "our spectrogram ( figure 2 ) is unambiguous : with very strong c  iv lines at @xmath6 4650 and 5808   , and weaker but still conspicuous lines of c  iii @xmath6 5696 and o",

    "( 1998 ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing stars in the sample is wr6 , which shows broad balmer and hei lines unlike most typical late - type wn stars .",
    "an excellent spectrogram of this star , obtained nine years before ours , is shown by terlevich et al .",
    "( 1996 ; see their figure 7 ) .",
    "these authors call attention to the strong spectroscopic variability of wr6 s emission lines between 1980 and 1992 .",
    "our spectrogram ( figure 4 ) is virtually identical to the one shown by terlevich et al .",
    ", including line widths and he / h line ratios ; this suggests a ( temporary ? ) stagnation in the rapid spectroscopic evolution of this star observed recently .",
    "we must note that our spectrogram includes the strong continuuum from the star 0.6@xmath3 to the west of wr6 , but our 2d spectrogram clearly shows that all the broad emission lines come from the faintest of the pair .",
    "two wr stars , wr7 and wr11 , are located in an area with high extinction , according to the extinction map of maz - apellniz ( 2004 ; compare his figure 6 with our figure 3 ) .",
    "their continuum and emission - line flux was therefore found to be low in the previous imaging work .",
    "but the spectrum of wr7 is unambiguous with very strong lines of c iv at 4650   and 5812    but no evidence of c iii 5696 , indicating a wc4 classification .",
    "wr11 , first noticed as an emission - line star by dms93 , is not correctly identified in the original finding chart ( their figure 6 ) .",
    "a careful superposition of the 1991 emission - line image from the canada - france - hawaii telescope , which was originaly used to identify wr candidates , with the more recent hst / acs images , as well as an analysis of the location of the emission line in our more recent 2d spectra , clearly identifies wr11 as the brightest star in a very tight group of a half - dozen stars separated by less than 2@xmath3 ; its correct identification is now shown in figure 3 . the only emission feature visible in the spectrum of wr11 is a broad ( fwhm = 37    ) he ii 4686 line . because the group of stars in which wr11 stands is unresolved in ground - based spectrum , the true equivalent width of the line is certainly much higher , making wr11 a genuine wn star .",
    "however , we find no evidence for he ii 5411 nor c iv 5800 in its spectrum .",
    "wr8 and wr10 were first detected in the cfht images of dms90 , and figure 1 shows that their spectra are very similar .",
    "with well - resolved emission lines of heii 4686 ( fwhm = 15  ) , n iii 4634 , 40 and c iv 5808 , as well as absorption features of nv 4604 and 4620  , the spectrum of these two stars is very similar to that of the galactic wn6 star hd 93162 ( wr25 ; see figure 1 in walborn & fitzpatrick 2000 ) .",
    "wr12 was identified as having a weak he ii excess by dms93 in their ground - based cfht images , but not in their pre - costar hst images because of the low s / n ratio .",
    "wfpc2 ultraviolet ( f170w filter ) images shown by bruhweiler et al .",
    "( 2003 ) clearly separate wr12 into two stars separated by less than 0.3@xmath3 , labeled 690a ( the faintest of the pair , classified as o5 iii according to stis uv spectra ) and 690b ( b0 ib ) . based on this uv classification",
    ", one should not expect to see he ii 4686 in emission in either star ( walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) .",
    "our slit includes both stars , and the resulting spectrum ( figures 1 and 5 ) clearly shows a broad emission bump ( total w@xmath7 = 15  ) which includes the he ii line ( w@xmath7 = 5   confirming the early diagnostic based on imagery ) accompanied by hei 4713 , niii 4634,40 and possibly civ 4650 .",
    "we also detect strong p cygni profiles of he i at 4388 , 4471 and 4921 as well as an absorption line of he ii 5411 ; a careful examination of the 2d spectroscopic images along the trace of wr12 clearly shows that these lines are of stellar origin and are not significantly contaminated by nebular emission .",
    "the more extended spectrogram of wr12 shown in figure 5 bears striking similarities with that of the wn10 star sk@xmath8 .",
    "although our optical spectrum is a composite of two stars , it is more likely that most of the emission lines come from the brightest one ( 690b ) .     to the west of wr6 .",
    ", width=317 ]        to confirm this , we have analyzed wfpc2 images ( program 5773 ) obtained with the nebular filters f656n ( h@xmath0 ) and f673n ( centered on the [ sii ] @xmath9 6717,31 doublet ) . since stellar spectra",
    "do not show the presence of these sulfur lines , and since the two nebular filters are close enough in terms of wavelength ( reducing possible extinction effects ) , we have used the f673n image as a continuum reference ( figure 6 ) and subtracted it from the h@xmath0 image . selected fields from the resulting continuum - subtracted image are shown in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "figure 7 demonstrates the power of this technique on a field centered on ngc 604-wr6 , which is known to be a strong h@xmath0 emitter ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the field around wr12 .",
    "in addition to wr12 , he ii emission - line stars wr3 , wr8 and v1 clearly show up as h@xmath0 emitters .",

    "dms93 allude to a spectrogram , obtained in october 1992 , showing he ii in emission , but did not publish it .",
    "the more recent spectrogram ( october 2001 ) shows this line ( fwhm = 14  ) , as well as n iii 4640 in emission , absorption lines of he ii 4541 and 5411 , and p cygni profiles for the he i lines at 4471 and 5876  . we also detect a weak ( w@xmath12 = 1.0  ) emission line of c iii @xmath6 5696 . a comparison between spectra obtained in 1992 and 2001 shows a significant weakening ( by a factor of 2.5 ) of the he ii 4686 line ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the 1992 spectrum did not show the he ii absorption lines ( perhaps filled with emission ) , nor the c iii @xmath6 5696 emission .",
    "finally , wr13 was never identified as a wr candidate but since it is the brightest star inside a prominent ionized arc in the northeastern part of the nebula ( see figure 6 ) , we took advantage of the mos capabilities and superposed a slitlet on it to satisfy our curiosity .",
    "its spectrum shows very weak emission lines of heii 4686 ( w@xmath7 = 1.2  ) and niii 4640 ( w@xmath7 = 3.3  ) , as well as absorption lines of heii 4541 and 5411 and hei 4471 .",
    "a comparison with stars in the atlas of walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) suggests a spectral type o6.5 iaf , similar to the galactic star hd 163758 .      , with north at the top and east to the left .",
    ", width=317 ]    an updated finding chart for w - r stars in ngc 595 is shown in figure 10 . among all w - r candidates in ngc 595 ,",
    "only wr2 ( components a and b ) , wr9 and wr11 lacked a clear , individual , spectroscopic identification , althought spectrograms including both wr2ab and wr11 ( both objects , separated by less than 2@xmath3 , are themselves multiple as shown by wfpc2 images ) as well as wr9 clearly show the presence of at least one wnl star ( conti & massey 1981 , massey et al .",
    "but a re - examination of the hst / wfpc images discussed by dms93 shows that the excess of light at 4686   at the location of the candidate w - r star wr11 is marginal at best , and no emission excess could be detected for wr10 .",
    "indeed , massey & johnson ( 1998 ) question the presence of emission lines in wr10 .",
    "moreover , royer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) unambiguously detect wr2 and wr9 as w - r candidates in their images obtained with a set of narrow - band filters , but also fail to detect wr10 and wr11 .",
    "so we decided to remove both objects from our list of w - r candidates and therefore they do not appear in figure 10 .",
    "the only new spectroscopic confirmation from this paper is that of ngc 595-wr9 .",
    "its spectrum ( figure 1 ) is comparable to that of the galactic star wr22 ( hd 92740 ; see figure 1 in walborn & fitzpatrick 2000 ) , with w@xmath12 = 18   for he ii 4686 and 9   for n iii 4634 , 40 .",
    "we also detect an emission line of he ii 5411 ( w@xmath12 = 4.5  ) .",
    "the first spectrogram of wr3 ( mc29 ) , published by massey & conti ( 1983 ) , allowed a crude wc classification .",
    "line ratios ( c iv 5808 , c iii 5696 and o iii , v 5590 ) in our spectrogram ( figure 2 ) allows us to refine the classification to wc6 .",
    "it is interesting to note that wr3 is the only wc star in ngc 595 .",
    "ngc 595-wr1 and ngc 595-wr5 have very similar spectra in terms of line ratio , and both can be classified as wn7 .",
    "the equivalent width of all lines are larger by a factor of two for wr5 ; this could be due , at least in part , to some contamination by the continuum of the bright star 1.3@xmath3 south of wr1 .",
    "ngc595-wr5 is in a region of relatively weak nebular emission , and we were able to subtract the nebular component from its spectrum , which is shown in its entirety in figure 11 .",
    "the relative strengths of the pure helium lines ( 4200  , 4541  , and 5411  ) to those for which helium and hydrogen both contribute ( 4340   and 4860  ) clearly indicate the presence of hydrogen in the atmosphere of ngc 595-wr5 .",
    "ngc 592 and ngc 588 are much less luminous and rich in wr stars than ngc 595 and ngc 604 , by factors of 3 to 10 , but they nevertheless include a fair population of young , massive stars .",
    "we defer the analysis of their stellar content , based on hst archives , to another paper ( beda , drissen & crowther , in preparation ) , but we present here a spectrum and some images relevant to their emission - line star content .",
    "ngc 592 is ten times less luminous than ngc 604 , both in terms of h@xmath0 luminosity ( bosch et al .",
    "2002 ) and in uv continuum ( as measured with the large fuse aperture at 1150   ; see pellerin 2006 ) , and until now very little is known about its stellar content .",
    "it includes four wr stars : two in the core ( identified as wr1 and wr2 following dms90 ) , and two more in the outskirts : mc19 and mca2 .",
    "their positions are labeled in a composite visible image in figure 12 as wr1 , wr2 , mc19 and mca2 . despite the factor ten",
    "smaller in h@xmath0 luminosity compared to ngc 604 , figure 12 shows that the ionizing cluster of ngc 592 still contains a fair number of massive stars .",
    "a spectrogram of ngc  592wr1 ( wnl ) is shown in conti & massey ( 1981 , cm3 ) .",
    "ngc  592wr1 ( also known as mc17 , or wr25 in massey & johnson 1998 ) was originally misidentified with the brighter but slightly redder companion 1@xmath3 to the north - east ( star b67 in humphreys & sandage 1980 ) , but it was already strongly suggested by the images presented in drissen et al .",
    "( 1990 ) that the wr star was not the brightest component of the tight pair ; it is now obvious in the wfpc2 images .",
    "ngc  592wr1 is also the cluster s brightest uv source in the f170w image .",
    "ngc  592wr2 , first identified as a wr candidate by drissen et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , lacked spectral confirmation until now .",
    "our spectrogram of this star is shown in figure 13 , and is that of a wn4 star as deduced from the weakness of the he  i 5876 line and the absence of n  iii 4640 .",
    "a comparison of our spectrum with those of a dozen galactic wne stars shows that the red spectrum of ngc  592wr2 most closely resembles that of the galactic wn4 star wr44 , analysed by hamann & koesterke ( 1998 ) .",
    "a careful comparison of the wfpc2 image and the cfht 2d spectra clearly shows that wr2 is the brightest of a close pair separated by 0.6@xmath3 .",
    "the spectrum of mc19 ( wce ) was first published by massey & conti ( 1983 ) , while mca2 is a wn star whose spectrum has been published by massey , conti & armandroff ( 1987 ) .",
    "ngc 588 was not part of the imaging survey by drissen , moffat & shara ( 1990 ) .",
    "however , two emission - line stars are known in this cluster : mc3 , a wnl , detected with narrow - band imagery by conti & massey ( 1981 ) and spectroscopically confirmed by massey & conti ( 1983 ) ; and uit-008 , a transition of / wn9 star ( see massey & johnson 1998 for a visible spectrogram and bianchi , bohlin & massey 2004 for a uv spectrogram ) selected for follow - up spectroscopy because of its high uv luminosity .",
    "ngc 588 is , like the other giant hii regions discussed in this paper , a crowded place and high - resolution images are required to properly identify the stars .",
    "fortunately , ngc 588 was imaged with wfpc2 in many bands in 1994 ( figure 14 ) , including f469n , a narrowband filter centered on the heii 4686 emission line . only mc3 clearly stands out in the f469n image ; it is 0.5 mag brighter than in the f439w image .",
    "uit-008 is marginally brighter in the f469n image than in the continuum f439w , by 0.1 mag ; this is consistent with the weakness of its emission lines .",
    "we have spectroscopically confirmed the presence of emission lines in a sample of wr candidates selected by interference filter imagery .",
    "most of them are genuine wr stars , but we have also detected transition - type evolved o stars , with an he ii equivalent width as low as 5   . as demontrated here and in previous publications , this technique is very efficient , especially in crowded fields ( see also hadfield & crowther 2007 ) , with a very high success rate and relatively few false detections .",
    "the census of the wr population in ngc 588 , ngc 592 , ngc 595 and ngc 604 is now essentially complete : only three stars ( ngc 604-wr2 , ngc 604-wr4 and ngc 595-wr2 ) , which are members of very dense and barely resolved groups , lack a clear identification although their wr nature is not in doubt .",
    "we have also obtained good quality spectrograms of previously known wr stars in these regions , allowing a better spectral type identification .",
    "the four giant hii region studied here harbour about 20% of the entire known wolf - rayet population of m33 , with a wc / wn ratio significantly lower ( 0.25 ) than that of the field ( 0.4 ; massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
