    "in semiconductor physics , the influence of doping is generally accounted for by a homogeneous shift of the fermi - level , caused by the introduction of free carriers in the semiconductor . however , when the dimensions of a device are small compared to the average distance between individual dopants , the discrete nature of doping",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "each individual ionized dopant introduces a coulomb potential well in the semiconductor , locally distorting the potential landscape .",
    "when the number of dopants in the volume of semiconductor that determines the transport characteristics of a device gets small , these random potential fluctuations cause atypical behavior of semiconductor devices @xcite .",
    "this is commonly viewed as one of the fundamental limits in the ongoing size - reduction of cmos - technology @xcite .",
    "mapping the positions of individual dopants @xcite and the potential fluctuations they induce @xcite has been performed experimentally with various techniques .",
    "furthermore , the influence of statistical fluctuations due to random dopants on device behavior has been subject of simulations @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we experimentally investigate the effects of the discreteness of doping on the transport properties of small diodes by comparing many identically prepared devices .",
    "we find that statistical fluctuations caused by randomly positioned individual dopant atoms do not average out for very small devices .",
    "in contrast , fluctuations dominate the electrical transport properties of the smallest devices and cause large differences in the conductance of nominally equal devices .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that at low temperature the coulomb well of a single dopant gives rise to a resonant tunneling channel .",
    "in order to allow for measuring the transport characteristics of many identically prepared diodes , we use self - assembly methods to fabricate epitaxial cosi@xmath0-diodes . the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) is used to characterize and access the devices individually .",
    "all experiments are performed in an ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) system with a base pressure of @xmath1  mbar .",
    "self assembled cosi@xmath0-islands are grown on si - substrates ( resistivity @xmath2 cm , doping concentration around @xmath3  @xmath4 ) by evaporating a sub - monolayer of cobalt onto a clean @xmath5-reconstructed si(111 ) surface , followed by an anneal at 800  @xmath6c for about 5  min .",
    "the resulting hexagon - shaped epitaxial cosi@xmath0-islands have heights in the range of 210  nm and diameters in the range of 1580  nm . the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : meanstd ] displays an stm - image of a typical island .",
    "each island is regarded as a nanometer sized epitaxial metal - semiconductor diode .",
    "the inter - island distances are roughly ten times larger than the island diameters . to minimize the effect of surface related transport channels , the @xmath5 surface reconstruction surrounding the islands",
    "is destroyed by exposing it to atomic hydrogen for 10  min at a substrate temperature of 400  @xmath6c .",
    "current - voltage ( @xmath7 ) measurements are performed by positioning the stm - tip over an island . after switching off the feedback loop ,",
    "the tip is lowered by 15   , which is found to be sufficient to make contact to the island .",
    "then the current is measured while ramping the voltage , yielding well - reproducible @xmath7-curves that reflect the properties of the metal - semiconductor contact . the sample preparation and measurements techniques",
    "are described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "some typical room - temperature measurements are displayed in the inset of fig.[fig : scatterhigh ] , showing weakly rectifying @xmath7-curves , compatible with the @xmath8-type substrate - doping .",
    "the overall shape of the curves is very similar . to investigate the dependence of the diode s conductances on their size , in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterhigh ] the zero - bias conductance per unit area is plotted as a function of island area for more than 40 different islands , grown on two similar @xmath8-type ( boron - doped ) samples .",
    "one would expect that devices of equal size yield the same value for this quantity .",
    "indeed , for larger devices the conductance per unit area falls within a narrow range .",
    "however , towards smaller areas there is no definite behavior .",
    "instead , the scatter in the measured values increases rapidly and nominally equal devices yield very different results",

    "the inset shows an stm - image of a typical island , acquired at room - temperature directly after preparation.,width=321 ]    measurement inaccuracies are not the source of this random scatter , as proved by the low noise level ( typically less than 10  pa around zero bias ) and good reproducibility of measurements on the same device .",
    "moreover , this scatter is absent in similar measurements on low - doped samples ( not shown ) .",
    "schottky barrier inhomogeneities @xcite , which have been observed at non - epitaxial interfaces @xcite , do not play a role here , as they are due to variations in the atomic arrangement at the metal - semiconductor interface itself .",
    "the metal - semiconductor interfaces in our devices are perfectly epitaxial and mono - crystalline , which is supported by cross - sectional transmission electron micrographs of similar structures @xcite .",
    "this also rules out interface defects or grain boundaries as the origin of the fluctuations .",
    "in addition , beem measurements of cosi@xmath0-films on undoped si(111 ) reveal a perfectly homogeneous schottky barrier height @xcite .",
    "only islands showing an atomically flat and defect - free surface in the stm - images were included in the analysis .",
    "we will show that the increased scatter in the measured data is caused by the presence of randomly distributed dopant atoms in the schottky barrier .",
    "an ionized dopant atom locally distorts the barrier , giving rise to a local barrier reduction and thus a high conductance spot ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : ltiv ] ) .",
    "then , the observed spread in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanstd ] is directly related to the spread in the number of dopant atoms @xmath12 in the barrier of a device . from poisson statistics ,",
    "the relative spread is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the standard deviation of @xmath12 .",
    "because @xmath15 is proportional to the island area @xmath16 , this gives that the standard deviation of the number of dopants per unit area increases when the device area decreases .",

    "[ fig : meanstd ] shows that a function of the form @xmath9 describes our observations appropriately .      to further investigate the influence of individual dopant atoms on the transport properties of small diodes",

    "the inset schematically shows the band diagram of an unbiased device .",
    "the dashed line is the initial conduction band ( @xmath23 ) profile .",

    "it was calculated from the average of several @xmath7-curves per island and plotted for the same two islands in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : ltiv ] .",
    "this is a well - known approach in the field of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy @xcite and is very useful as it reduces the overall exponential behavior and enhances bias - dependent features .",
    "indeed , the weak features in the @xmath7-curves turn into clear peaks and the peaks show a one - to - one correspondence to the features in the @xmath7-curves . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ltiv ] , features appear at one bias polarity , only .",
    "this is true for all acquired curves on the same sample . for substrates with the opposite doping type ,",
    "the peaks occur at the opposite bias polarity ( not shown ) .",
    "the peaks can be explained by resonant tunneling through a discrete energy level of a dopant atom , occurring when the fermi - level at either side of the barrier lines up with an energy level of the dopant s potential well .",
    "the resulting resonant channel produces a feature in the measurement curve .",
    "resonances are expected at bias voltages from zero upto the barrier height ( roughly 0.50.7  v , depending on the dopant type ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observations .",
    "the actual bias voltage at which a resonance occurs is predominantly determined by the distance of the dopant atom to the interface .",
    "the number of peaks in a typical spectrum ( 1 to 4 ) corresponds to the expected number of dopants in the devices , as we will show later .",
    "this confirms our hypothesis that individual dopants influence the conduction path .",
    "motivated by the foregoing observations , we present a model that links the conductance fluctuations observed at room temperature to ( random ) dopant positions . moreover , the parameters in the model are directly related to device parameters .    because the dopants in the substrate are randomly distributed , the number of dopants @xmath12 in the barrier of a given island is poisson - distributed with parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this means that the probability @xmath27 that @xmath12 equals @xmath28 for a certain device is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean value of the number of dopants in the barrier of this particular device .",
    "the parameter can be expressed as @xmath31 , where @xmath16 is the area of the island , @xmath32 the effective thickness of the barrier and @xmath33 the average doping concentration in the barrier . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanstd ] , the scatter in the number of dopants in the barrier per unit area satisfies @xmath34 and therefore is large for small islands .",
    "we will now show that this effect also creates scatter in conductance measurements .",
    "we assume that dopants located in a certain region close to the metal - semiconductor interface induce a local barrier lowering that gives rise to a low - resistance transport channel .",
    "the conductance of a transport channel induced by a dopant atom depends on the dopant s distance to the interface .",
    "since the distance is a random variable , the conductance @xmath35 of a single channel is not the same for all channels , but has a certain probability distribution .",
    "the distribution is given by a probability density function @xmath36 , meaning that @xmath37 is the probability for a certain channel to have a conductance @xmath35 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "both the distribution of the position of a dopant in the barrier and the dependence of the conductance of a channel on that position are contained in @xmath36 .",
    "assuming that the values of the conductance of the individual channels are independent and characterized by the same distribution given by @xmath36 , the total conductance of a device is given by the sum of the contributions of the individual channels . here",
    ", we neglect the background conduction and assume that the conductance is dominated by these channels . if there are @xmath28 channels , the total conductance is @xmath40 , where the conductance of the individual channels is denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "the density function @xmath42 of @xmath43 can be calculated explicitly by taking the @xmath28-fold convolution of @xmath36 @xcite @xmath44 finally , taking into account the poisson distribution of the number of channels ( eq .  [ eq : pois ] ) , the density function @xmath45 of the total conductance @xmath46 of a device can be computed as @xmath47 in other words , for given device parameters @xmath33 , @xmath16 and @xmath32 , @xmath48 is the probability that the total conductance @xmath46 due to dopant atoms in the diode is between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    to illustrate its behavior , fig .",
    "[ fig : scattermap ] shows a map of @xmath49 ( from eq .",
    "[ eq : dist ] ) as a function of @xmath50 ( proportional to the conductance per unit area ) and @xmath26 ( which is proportional to @xmath16 ) . for a fixed value of the device area ( that is a fixed value of @xmath26 and a vertical line in the plot )",
    "the color scale gives the probability density to find a device with a particular conductance per unit area @xmath50 .",
    "for large values of @xmath26 , all density is concentrated around @xmath51 , while for smaller @xmath26 it is spread over an increasingly wide range of values . in this figure @xmath36",
    "was chosen as a uniform distribution .",
    "however , as we will show next , the general properties of @xmath45 are not strongly dependent on the particular choice of @xmath36 .     as defined in eq .",

    "for @xmath36 a uniform distribution was chosen.,width=321 ]    without making any assumptions on the choice of @xmath36 , we can compute the moments of @xmath45 in terms of those of @xmath36 .",
    "first , the mean value of @xmath46 satisfies @xmath52    in fact , to allow for easy comparison with the data , we consider the total conductance _ per unit area _ @xmath53 . by making the substitution @xmath54 .",
    "it follows directly that the average value of @xmath53 satisfies @xmath55 this is a very intuitive result , since @xmath56 equals the average number of dopants in the barrier per unit area multiplied by the average conductance per channel .    to obtain the standard deviation",
    "we first observe that @xmath57 when the @xmath41 are independently identically distributed .",
    "using this fact , we find that @xmath58 finally , this yields @xmath59    by making the substitution @xmath54 once more , we find that the standard deviation @xmath60 ( which can be interpreted as the spread in @xmath53 ) is given by @xmath61 the most important observation from this equation is that @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath62 , showing that the area - dependence of @xmath63 leads to a similar behavior of spread in @xmath53 .",
    "this also justifies the choice of the fit - function in fig .",

    "this number is consistent with e.g.  an average doping concentration at the interface around @xmath71  @xmath4 and an effective barrier thickness of @xmath72  nm .",
    "note that because @xmath32 is the thickness of the barrier region where dopants influence the barrier height , it is thinner than the total schottky barrier thickness ( a few tens of nanometers in this case ) .",
    "second , we find @xmath73  na / v for the average conductance per channel . in order to achieve this value ,",
    "it is necessary to have e.g.  a small patch with a local barrier height of approximately @xmath74  ev and an area . ] of approximately 10  nm@xmath19 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the actual sample parameters .    on average , the conductance per unit area increases for decreasing island area , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterhigh ] . this can be explained by the scaling mechanism described in ref .  , which predicts that the barrier thickness decreases with device size for devices that are smaller than a few times the debye length .",

    "hence the induced local barrier lowering is the most pronounced in thin barriers .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that individual dopant atoms dominate the transport characteristics of epitaxial nanometer sized metal semiconductor diodes .",
