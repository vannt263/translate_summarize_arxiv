    "@xmath95 the arguments are the same , although some involutions must be replaced with certain conjugates which move the puncture to a fixed point of the involution .",
    "we begin by recalling the so - called _ lantern relation _ in @xmath0 .",
    "this relation was discovered by dehn @xcite in the 1930s and was rediscovered by johnson @xcite over forty years later . for convenience , we will use the notation @xmath96 in addition to @xmath44 to denote the ( right - handed ) dehn twist about the simple closed curve @xmath42 in @xmath43 .    referring to the four boundary curves @xmath97 and @xmath98 of the surface @xmath99 together with the interior curves @xmath100 and @xmath101 , as shown in figure  [ lantern ] , the lantern relation is the following relation amongst the corresponding dehn twists : @xmath102    @xmath103{lanternrel.eps}\\ ] ]    the symmetry of figure  [ lantern ] clearly shows that the twists on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : lantern ] ) can be cyclically permuted .",
    "moreover , each twist on the right - hand side commutes with all other twists in the relation since the corresponding curves are disjoint from all others in the lantern .",
    "thus we can rewrite the relation in the following way , which will be convenient for our purposes : @xmath104    the following lemma improves on a result of luo @xcite and harer @xcite ; they showed that a dehn twist about a nonseparating curve can be written as a product of six involutions .",

    "if @xmath10 , we can find a lantern as in figure  [ lantern ] embedded in @xmath43 such that the given curve @xmath70 plays the role of @xmath98 and such that the complement of the lantern is connected and its four boundary curves are distinct and nonseparating in @xmath43 .",
    "let us call such an embedding a _",

    "we note that the surface of figure  [ twist ] could be embedded in @xmath125 in such a way that the involution @xmath122 of the surface is a restriction of an isometry of @xmath125 ; one can simply add a tube connecting the two ends which encloses the surface of figure  [ twist ] .",

    "in particular , there is a conjugate involution @xmath129 taking the pair @xmath123 to the pair @xmath130 .",

    "if we then let @xmath164 play the role of @xmath165 , we see that @xmath166 , and thus @xmath83 plays the role of @xmath167 in the proof of lemma  [ lh ] .",
    "now , in order to make further use of our work in proving lemma  [ lh ] , we assign to the curve @xmath163 the role of @xmath98 , so that @xmath165 and @xmath98 are separated by @xmath133 from @xmath131 and @xmath132 . of the two remaining curves ,",

    "we also choose interior curves @xmath134 and",
    "@xmath101 so the labels of the good lantern of figure  [ good ] match those of the pair swaps defined in the previous section .",

    "note that in the first two cases , the @xmath118-curves that are interchanged are not separated in the lantern by the fixed curve @xmath101 , but in the last two cases , the @xmath118-curves being swapped are separated by the fixed curve @xmath133 .",
    "thus any possible configuration of such pair swaps can be achieved , although a different embedding may be required in order to align the @xmath119-curve to be fixed in the swap either `` horizontally '' or `` vertically '' , depending , respectively , on whether the two @xmath118-curves one wishes to swap are separated by the @xmath119-curve , or lie on the same side .",
    "we now have that the product @xmath184 takes the pair @xmath185 to the pair @xmath186 and we can rewrite ( [ eq : l4 ] ) as @xmath187 [ ( j_3 j_2 ) ( x_1 a_1^{-1})(j_2 j_3)]\\ ] ] since @xmath188 as above , we see that we need just one new involution , @xmath175 , in order to generate @xmath158 .",
    "similarly , we can find a pair - swap involution @xmath189 taking the pair @xmath185 to @xmath190 , so that we can write @xmath191 [ j_1 ( x_1 a_1^{-1 } ) j_1 ] [ j_2 ( x_1 a_1^{-1})j_2 ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath189 being the only new involution required to write @xmath141 .",
    "thus our count for the number of involutions used to generate each of the four elements @xmath192 stands , respectively , at @xmath193 involutions .",
    "finally , as pointed out to us by m. kassabov , the involution @xmath189 is in fact redundant , and can be taken to be the product @xmath194 .",
