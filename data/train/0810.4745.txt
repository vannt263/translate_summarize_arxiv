    "therefore , the transport coefficient in the membrane is different from that inside and outside of the cell .",
    "we constructed a simple reaction - diffusion system based on the schlgl model to understand the confined nonequilibrium states accompanying the transport of materials through the membrane qualitatively.@xcite in the model , the schlgl reaction proceeds in a vesicle with a semipermeable membrane , where the diffusion constant of some materials is small or zero .",
    "the semipermeable membrane is necessary to confine the activity inside of the cell .",
    "because complicated reactions including those of dna and rna , and active transport through the membrane were not included in the model , our model is too simple as a model of a living cell .",
