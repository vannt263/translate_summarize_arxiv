    "solutions of a restricted class of nonlinear equations yield an ample variety of topological ( kink - like ) and non - topological ( lump - like ) defects of current interest , in particular to mathematical and physical applications as well @xcite .",

    "essentially , the energy density of the localized solution captures the nonlinear nature of the corresponding lagrangian , making its dynamics an insightful topic . in this sense , topological and",
    "non - topological structures are not only of mathematical interest .",
    "defect structures are indeed investigated in cosmological scenarios involving seeds for structure formation @xcite , q - balls @xcite , and tachyon branes @xcite ; in braneworld scenarios with a single extra - dimension of infinity extent @xcite ; in particle physics as magnetic monopoles @xcite ; and in some applications on soft condensed matter physics @xcite involving , for instance , charge transport in diatomic chains @xcite , or even baby _ skyrmions _ @xcite .",
    "specific studies involving kink - like defects are also used to be related to the symmetry restoration in inflationary scenarios @xcite , or to the fermion effective mass generation induced by some symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite .",
    "likewise , applications of current interest predominantly include the use of lump - like models to describe the behavior of bright solitons in optical fibers @xcite .",
    "in particular , it represents the most prominent candidate for ultra - high - speed packet - switched optical networks in the current communication revolution .    notwithstanding the pop science status of this field ",
    "once its proponents seek to put it to use for transporting vast amounts of information  the analysis regarding defect structure solutions may still require the introduction of challenging mathematical devices amalgamating analytical , geometrical , and sometimes complex numerical protocols .",
    "therefore , finding a systematic process for obtaining cyclically deformed defects , constrained by closure relations involving their topological masses , corresponds to the well succeeded purpose of this work .",
    "hereon the nomenclature of topological mass is arbitrarily extended to encompass the finite total energy of non - topological lump - like solutions .",
    "our work is concerned with a systematic procedure for defect generation defined through trigonometric and hyperbolic bijective deformation functions .",
    "they allow the construction of @xmath2-finite cyclic deformation chains involving topological and non - topological solutions .",
    "the obtained defects are necessarily generated and regenerated from a primitive defect of an original theory ( for instance , the @xmath3 theory ) .    in this context , several simplificative techniques",
    "have been suggested to study and solve non - linear equations through deformation procedures @xcite .",
    "the main issues that have stimulated us to investigate cyclically deformed defects have indeed appeared through the bps first order framework @xcite for obtaining kink - like and lump - like structures .",
    "such an outstanding process of systematically obtaining cyclically deformed defects allows reedifying a preliminarily introduced defect structure - for instance , the usual kink defect from the @xmath3 theory - through successive , unidirectional , and eventually irreversible , deformation operations .",
    "this possibility of regenerating a primitive defect is one of our principal concerns in this work .",
    "our second main contribution consists in systematically defining constraint relations , involving topological masses of the corresponding deformed defects which belong to the cyclically deformed chain .",
    "our technique also supports kink - like and lump - like solutions in models described by a single real scalar field , such that extensions to quantum mechanics follow the usual theory of deformed defects @xcite .",

    "plateau_-shaped form for the potential of a deformed kink - solution which , for instance , introduces the possibility of a kind of slow - rolling behavior for the scalar field deformed solution , @xmath4 , when its dynamics is turned on .",
    "a systematic and generalized procedure that simultaneously supports kink - like and lump - like defects into @xmath0-cyclic deformation chains is introduced and scrutinized in section iii .",
    "the topological conserved quantities are analytically computed and the constraint relations , involving trigonometric and hyperbolic deformation functions , are straightforwardly obtained . the results from section iii",
    "are extended to a @xmath1-cyclic deformation device which is furthermore driven by hyperbolic and trigonometric deformation chains .",
    "our results shall ratify that the modified topological masses ( or the total energy of localized solutions , in the case of lumps ) , computed for defect structures cyclically deformed from a triggering @xmath5 theory , are mutually constrained .",
    "finally , the hyperbolic and trigonometric deformation procedures are systematically generalized to @xmath2-finite cyclically deformed defects in section v. we draw our conclusions in section vi by attempting to some important insights related to the study of defect structures which bring up the novel concept of @xmath2-cyclic deformations .",
