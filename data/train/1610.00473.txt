    "our purpose is to compare the basic properties of certain non - euclidean planes through some known results on two types of curves , which is the motivation for the long introduction before the essential part of this paper .",
    "these planes are the so - called hyperbolic , spherical , minkowski and lorentzian planes .",
    "we note that even though there is an analytic approach for the examined curves in most of the planes , which we investigate here , the geometric method of construction leads to the definitions that can be interpreted in every case .",
    "we do not think that everybody regards our approach of these non - euclidean planes good .",
    "we think even less that the collected literature in this paper is complete .",
    "however , the large number of rediscovered results in this evergreen topic shows that our paper may not be useless .    in the paper",
    ", we first present a unified model of the plane geometries , then compare the theories of the examined constructive curves .",
    "clearly , there is no room here to mention all results discovered in the last three hundred years .",
    "nevertheless , in our approach some important characteristics are shown which behave analogously in all these geometries , and we concentrate on them . in our investigation , it will be very important to know which definitions work simultaneously in all cases , how we can classify the conics , and how basic kinematics works in these planes .",
    "we add a large number of references to the introduction of the theory of the curves .",
    "we require an analytic approach to the investigated geometries , and thus , we can not mention here non - euclidean planes with only a synthetic model , for example non - paschian planes based on a synthetic construction as in @xcite .",
    "the common root of the four geometries used in the paper is a @xmath0-dimensional vector space endowed with a general scalar multiplication of the vectors .",
    "this multiplication is a function with two variables in @xmath1 , which , in the case that @xmath1 is a real vector space , we call a _",
    "product_. first we review a way to axiomatize it .",
    "this method gives a natural matching of these geometries , the lorentzian and minkowski plane are affine planes , respectively and the hyperbolic and spherical planes are hypersurfaces of certain affine spaces , respectively .",
    "the following two subsections contains the comparing of the planes in this direction .",

    "the investigation of roulettes in geometry is important not only with respect to their nice geometric properties but also their influence on kinematics .",

    "after this review we consider the validity of the euclidean results in our non - euclidean geometries . similarly to the case of conics in the minkowski plane we have to define new apparat to consider roulettes while in the cases of the other three geometries the roulettes have an analogous approach as in the euclidean situation .",
    "consider a plane @xmath163 which is moving on the fixed plane @xmath164 .",
    "the two simplest possibilities for such movements are given by translation and rotation .",
    "in euclidean geometry we can substitute the planes with cartesian coordinate frames @xmath165 and @xmath166 , and when we would like to describe the motion of a point @xmath167 of the moving plane , we need the coordinates @xmath168 of the point @xmath167 in the moving frame , the coordinates @xmath169 of @xmath170 in the fixed coordinate system , and the angle @xmath171 of the positive half of the @xmath117-axis of the fixed frame with the positive half of the @xmath45-axis of the moving frame .",
    "we get the coordinates @xmath45 , @xmath46 of the point @xmath167 in the fixed system by @xmath172 here @xmath173 are functions of a quantity @xmath111 which determine the motion .",
    "( for example , @xmath111 can denote the time , or any other metric parameter . )",
    "assume that @xmath174 is not zero on an interval of @xmath111",
    ". then it can be inverted , and @xmath169 can also be considered as a function of @xmath175 .",
    "( this assumption says that our motion can not contain translations in that domain .",
    "we call such a motion _ non - translative planar motion_. ) the derivative of the coordinate functions with respect to @xmath175 gives the coordinates of the velocity vector of the point @xmath167 .",
    "it is more convenient to use vector equality , and hence we introduce some further notion .",
    "let @xmath176 denote the rotation about the origin with signed angle @xmath175 .",
    "then the first equation array has the form @xmath177 if @xmath178 denotes the rotation with @xmath179 , we have the following rules : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the unit matrix .",
    "we denote by dot the _ derivative with respect to _ @xmath175 , which means in this section the euclidean arc - length parameter .",
    "it is clear that @xmath182 for every value of @xmath175 there is precisely one point @xmath183 of the moving plane for which the velocity vector vanishes .",
    "this is @xmath184 this point @xmath183 of the moving plane is a so - called _ instantaneous center ( or instantaneous pole ) _ of the motion , and the set of these points is the _ moving polode _ , or curve @xmath185 of instantaneous poles , of the moving plane .",
    "the points of the moving polode can also be obtained in the frame as rest .",
    "these points @xmath186 are of the form @xmath187 and form the so - called _ fixed polode _ , or curve @xmath188 of instantaneous centers , in the fixed plane .",
    "we examine the motion with respect to the point @xmath186 . if @xmath129 is arbitrary , then @xmath189 , and",
    "using the equality @xmath190 , we have @xmath191 . since @xmath192",
    ", we get that @xmath193 hence the velocity vector of the motion at the point @xmath129 is orthogonal to the position vector from @xmath186 to @xmath129 .",
    "this implies that the moving system in the given moment is a rotation about the center @xmath186 .",
    "observe that the velocity vectors of the two polodes at their common point agree ; in fact , @xmath194 hence the arc - length elements of the two curves agree and we get that in every moment the two curves are touching , and their arc - lengths calculated from a point @xmath195 to the point @xmath171 have the same value .",
    "hence the moving polode @xmath185 _ rolls without slipping _ ( or without friction ) on the fixed polode @xmath196 , and this is the only rolling process which corresponds to the given motion of the planes .",
    "hence we got the fact _ that every non - translatory planar motion of a rigid mechanical system in the plane can be considered as the rolling process of a curve rigidly connected with the system on a fixed curve in the plane_. this motivates the so - called main theorem of planar kinematics , namely : at every moment , any constrained non - translatory planar motion can be approximated ( up to the first derivative ) by an _ instantaneous rotation_. the center of this rotation is called the _",
    "instantaneous pole_. thus , for each position of the moving plane , we generally have exactly one point with velocity zero ( as a result of that , the instantaneous pole is also called velocity center ) .",
    "this theorem leads to an interesting class of curves in the euclidean plane . given",
    "a curve @xmath185 attached to a plane @xmath163 which is moving so that the curve rolls , without slipping , along a given curve @xmath188 attached to a fixed plane @xmath197 occupying the same space , then a point @xmath167 attached to @xmath163 describes a curve in @xmath164 called a _",
    "roulette_.    based on this rolling process we can rewrite the definition of the motion of rigid systems . observe that every planar motion implies the motion of all points of the moving plane with respect to the fixed one .",
    "these orbits are said to be roulettes .",
    "thus , for the studied motion we consider two curves , also called _ polodes _ , and a suitable rolling process to determine the motion of a singular point .",
    "for this purpose a method is needed to determine the fixed position of the point @xmath167 with respect to the moving polode .",
    "a usual method is to give a line through the point @xmath167 which intersects the moving polode in the point @xmath198 and fixes the distance of @xmath167 and @xmath198 and the angle of the line @xmath199 with the tangent line @xmath200 of the moving polode at @xmath198 .",
    "hence the choice of @xmath198 on the moving polode is arbitrary .",

    "the points of the roulette @xmath203 of @xmath198 can be obtained by the composition of the following transformations : translate the point @xmath204 into the origin , rotate the image of the point of @xmath205 about the origin by the angle @xmath206 , and translate the obtained point by @xmath207 .",
    "hence the equality of the roulette of @xmath198 in the fixed system is @xmath208 since the roulette @xmath209 of the point @xmath167 can be described by the formula @xmath210 , we get @xmath211 this means that if we have two touching arcs @xmath212 and @xmath204 of a plane @xmath164 , and we associate to the second arc a moving plane @xmath213 in which its position is fixed , then the rolling process of @xmath204 on @xmath207 ( locally ) uniquely determines an orbit of every point of @xmath163 . in the euclidean plane equation",
    "the above equation shows that in every moment with respect to varying @xmath214 we have an isometry .",
    "hence the rolling process of the arcs determines a rigid motion of the plane @xmath163 .",
    "this representation is locally unique , since a rigid motion uniquely determines its polodes .",
    "hence we have if @xmath215\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] are two simple jordan arcs with common touching point @xmath216 such that @xmath146 is the arc - length parameter of both of them ( considered from the points @xmath217 to the point @xmath207 , @xmath204 , respectively ) , then for every @xmath218 $ ] we have an isometry @xmath219 sending the original position vector @xmath220 into the instantaneously position @xmath221 .",

    "the most important results in this theory are the so - called euler - savary equations , which compare the curvatures of the moving polode , fixed polode and the corresponding roulettes .",
    "we use the following forms of them ( compare with fig .",
    "[ eulersavaryfig ] ) :        the _ first euler - savary equation _ is @xmath231 where @xmath232 are the curvature radius of the fixed polode at the instantaneous center and the curvature radius of the roulette at the examined point , respectively , @xmath233 is the length of the velocity vector and @xmath234 is the angular velocity of the motion .",
    "the _ second euler - savary equation _ says that @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the curvature radius of the moving polode at the instantaneous center .",
    "from these equations we can get a common form of the two equations which is @xmath237      spherical geometry of dimension @xmath238 is the geometry of a @xmath238-sphere embedded into a @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the motions of the sphere can be get from the three - dimensional special orthogonal linear group @xmath239 , containing those orthogonal transformations which hold the orientation .",
    "algebraically , this subgroup contains those linear transformations of the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space which determinant has value @xmath240 .",
    "euler observed that these transformations always has an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath240 showing that a motion of the sphere is a rotation about a line which is called by the rotational axis of the transformation .",
    "hence the rigid motions of the sphere not only the sequence of certain instantaneous rotations but the sequence of proper rotations of the sphere .",
    "in fact , in euclidean geometry we should combine the rotation of the coordinate system with the translation of its origin , contrary on the sphere the translation part is also a rotation ( at another point as the fixed origin ) hence the needed composition gives the product of three rotations which itself also a rotation ( at a new origin ) . to characterize the motion we have to give in a moment a rotation ,",
    "hence we have a function of the time , mapping the domain time - interval into @xmath239 , continuously .",
    "there are several papers on spherical roulettes because spherical kinematics is an intermediate step between planar and spatial kinematics .",
    "the earliest one is found by me , the work written by garnier in 1956 @xcite .",
    "considering one and two parameters spherical motions in euclidean space , muller gave the relations for absolute , sliding , relative velocities and pole curves of these motions .",
    "in addition to that he expressed the corresponding euler ",
    "savary formula related to the trajectory curves of these @xmath240-parameter spherical motions @xcite .",
    "i would like to mention here also the paper of chiang @xcite which contains the results of the most important theorems using spherical kinematics , especially the spherical form of euler - savary equations .",
    "for the verification of the results chiang proposed the books @xcite and @xcite .",
    "i would like to mention two nice recent papers .",
    "the first on by m.a .",

    "also strongly connected to the bar - joint kinematics , in chiang s paper we can find the complete lists of motions induced by bar - joint frameworks . as chiang said : _ spherical",
    "four - bar mechanisms are similar to planar four - bar mechanisms .",
    "there are also spherical crank - rockers , drag - links and double - rockers , and even also spherical slider - cranks. however , as there is no translation motion in spherical kinematics , because all spherical motions are rotations , there exists therefore no real spherical slider. what we call a slider here exists simply because a joint on the slider is moving along a great circle arc .",
    "in fact this joint is @xmath241 apart from its axis of rotation .",
    "it is interesting to note the spherical rotary slider - crank as that shown in fig.[chiangfig1 ] , and there is no planar counterpart . _        using the notation of chiang we can say the following .",

    "( note that @xmath48 is the pole changing velocity , and @xmath244 is the angular velocity ( magnitude ) of the moving body , respectively . ) finally , if @xmath245 means the center of curvature of the roulette then we have the following ( geometric form ) of the first euler - savary equation ( see in fig [ chiangfig2 ] ) :            it is very surprising but i can not find any paper on the internet on hyperbolic roulettes .",
    "it seems to be that the spherical approach can works also in the lorentzian space ( using it for its imaginary unit sphere ) .",
    "this analytically can solves the case of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "since roulettes can be defined by non - translatory motions , the basic problem of the general transition to hyperbolic geometry ( that is we have two types of isometries can work as a translation ) will not be occur .",

    "the relations between absolute , relative , sliding velocities ( and accelerations ) and pole curves was discussed , too . in the lorentzian plane euler - savary formula is given in references , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this connection follows from euler s theorem of classical mechanics which states that every planar motion can be considered as the sequence of instantaneous rotations , whose centers give the fixed polode .",

    "thinking about the concept of motion in a wider context , it can be allowed that the duration of the motion of a body a little bit changes its shape .",

    "the first one relies on an area - based measure for an ellipse , which is clearly well defined . in the second",
    "used the arc - length measure referring to a nephroid . here",
    "we quote only the first one .",
    "consider the euclidean plane and the system of ellipses with common focus at the origin @xmath293 and with major axis on the @xmath45-axis of the coordinate system , such that the positive half - line of @xmath45 contains the closest point of the ellipse ( see fig .",
    "[ heliofig ] ) . in that polar",
    "coordinate system ( which is called the heliocentric coordinate system for the ellipse ) , for which the ray @xmath294 is the positive half axis @xmath45 , we can write the radial function @xmath295 of the ellipse @xmath296 by the formula @xmath297 where @xmath214 is the semi - latus rectum of the ellipse and @xmath125 is the eccentricity of it , respectively . let @xmath298 be the area of the sector enclosed by @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and @xmath296 be the arc between these lines .",
    "hence @xmath301        with respect to @xmath292 and @xmath296 from above , for every real number @xmath302 there is a generalized rotation of the euclidean plane about @xmath293 with this angle @xmath111 . by kepler s second law about planetary motions ,",
    "the angle @xmath111 of a generalized rotation is proportional to the time of the motion of the planet .",
    "hence the generalized rotation with angle @xmath111 maps the current position @xmath303 of the planet to that point @xmath304 of the orbit where the planet arrives after time @xmath111 .    the principle of measuring the angle proportional to the area of the sector intersected by the angle domain from the basic disk @xmath305 works in all minkowski planes and for all basic curves @xmath296 .",
    "note that in the euclidean plane with the unit circle as basic curve , this choice of @xmath292 gives the usual angle measure , and that we get the usual rotations as generalized rotations by choosing @xmath167 to be the origin @xmath293 .",
    "an advantage of this choice is affine invariance , but there is also a big disadvantage .",
    "namely , the length of the arc @xmath296 containing the domain of the angle can not be calculated easily from this angle measure .",
    "( as a known example , we note that the calculation of the arc - length of an ellipse leads to a complete elliptic integral of second kind , which has no closed - form solution in terms of elementary functions . )",
    "if we consider two curves @xmath196 and @xmath185 , then we have to use a suitable lower subscript for the curvature function .",
    "we also have the concept of _ curvature radius _",
    "@xmath306 which is , as well - known , the reciprocal value of the curvature at the given point @xmath307 . with these notions we are able to formulate    if the unit circle of the minkowski plane is two times continuously differentiable , then the following equality holds : @xmath308 here @xmath306 is the curvature radius of the fixed polode at its point @xmath309 , @xmath310 is the curvature radius of the moving polode at its point @xmath311 , and @xmath312 is the length of the common velocity vector of the fixed and moving polodes at the moment @xmath146 and at the instantaneous pole @xmath313 .      the instantaneous center @xmath19 and the curvature center @xmath314 of the roulette at its point @xmath315 satisfy the equality @xmath316 where the second intersection point of the path normal line at @xmath167 with the inflection curve is the point @xmath317 .",
