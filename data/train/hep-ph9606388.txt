    "within the framework of the standard model of the electroweak and strong interactions the neutrinos are massless to all orders in perturbation theory . however , it is widely believed , based on the interpretation of current observations , that the neutrinos are massive and light , i.e. , @xmath31 - 100 ev ) @xcite .",
    "if confirmed by future experiments ( e.g. , the next generation of underground observatories and the long - baseline oscillation experiments ) the massive neutrinos would provide an unambiguous signal of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . for example , the small neutrino masses are often attributed to some sort of a see - saw mechanism involving an intermediate scale @xmath4 gev ) right - handed neutrino ( or some other structure at that scale ) , i.e. , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass in that case is a signal of the physics at intermediate scales .",
    "a different and most interesting possibility is that the neutrino mass is a signal of weak - scale physics . indeed",
    ", this could be the case within a supersymmetric framework @xcite as it could incorporate a new and novel ( but often overlooked ) mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses which was first proposed by hall and suzuki @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric theories naturally accommodate weak - scale scalars and are a strongly motivated candidate for an extension of the sm at a scale @xmath6 gev@xmath7 tev ) @xcite .",
    "thus , an investigation of neutrino mass generation within this framework is well motivated and would provide an alternative and unique interpretation of a neutrino mass signal . in turn",
    ", the latter could provide valuable information on the supersymmetric structure both at weak and planckian scales . in this work",
    "we will propose a new realization of that mechanism , argue for its naturalness within the context of supersymmetric model building , and examine its phenomenological and cosmological implications .",
    "( we will assume the supersymmetric extension of the sm throughout this work . )",
    "the neutrino mass generation follows in a straightforward manner if one allows a low - energy ( bilinear ) mass superpotential , @xmath8 , which is the most general one in the fields of the minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) and the sm @xmath9 gauge group .",
    "the ( renormalizable ) superpotential reads in that case @xmath10 where quark and lepton doublet chiral superfields by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the up- and down - quark singlets by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the lepton singlets by @xmath15 , respectively . @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the @xmath18 and @xmath19 higgs doublets , respectively .",
    "a chiral superfield and its scalar component will be denoted below by the same symbol .",
    "] @xmath20 is [ listing @xmath9 quantum numbers ] the ( 1,2,-1/2 ) four - vector in field space , the four - vector @xmath21 is of the order of magnitude of the weak scale and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the ( trilinear ) yukawa part of the superpotential .",
    "one neutrino species ( see below ) is now massive at tree level as a result of the superpotential mass term ( in a similar manner to the fermion partners of the higgs bosons  the higgsinos ) .",
    "the details of the yukawa superpotential @xmath23 would only affect the loop - level corrections to the masses .",
    "it is quite striking that the sm massless fermions ",
    "the neutrinos  are the only sm fermions that are allowed by the symmetries to have a supersymmetric mass . in general , supersymmetrtic mass parameters are naturally of the order of the grand - scale or are zero , e.g. , in string theory and grand - unified models .",
    "hence , low - energy mass parameters ( which are of the order of the weak - scale ) in ( [ sp1 ] ) represent a perturbation to the above expectation and they parameterize the high - energy physics in a similar way to the dimensionful supersymmetry breaking soft parametrs which set the scale @xmath22 ( see below for a discussion of the @xmath2-problem ) .",
    "once mass parameters are introduced , the term @xmath24 ( rather than only @xmath25 , which is the only superpotential mass term included in the mssm case ) is the most natural choice .",
    "the neutrino mass then arises from weak - scale parameters , but in fact , parameterizes the high - energy physics . naively , one might have expected that ( unless @xmath26 ) @xmath27 . however , a simple condition @xcite , which , as we will show , may be realized dynamically in universal models for the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , guarantees that this is not the case and that neutrinos as light as @xmath28100 ev@xmath29 are obtained .",
    "other proposals for weak - scale neutrino mass generation in a supersymmetric framework @xcite include mass generation due to the soft supersymmetry breaking sector , spontaneous lepton number breaking , and yukawa interactions .",
    "the supersymmetric neutrino mass mechanism @xcite , that we will examine here , embodies various aspects of all other proposals .",
    "the neutrino mass generation involves , in our case , several delicate issues which require some elaboration .",
    "while doing so , we will establish the outline of our proposed models .",
    "_ r - parity violation : _ the superpotential @xmath30 given in ( [ sp1 ] ) does not preserve lepton number , and thus , the discrete @xmath31 @xmath1-parity @xcite @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath12 are the particle spin , baryon and lepton numbers , respectively ) that is typically imposed in the mssm ( and forbids weak - scale neutrino mass generation ) is also broken . unlike in generic broken @xmath1-parity models ,",
    "the breaking here is restricted and does not lead to unacceptable proton - decay rates .",
    "specifically , the ( tree - level ) neutrino mass generation is insensitive to the details of @xmath23 , and the yukawa superpotential could still have ( approximately ) its sm form and preserve this or some other symmetry so that the proton is long lived .",
    "( in fact , for that purpose it is sufficient to preserve at the renormalizable level only baryon number , e.g. , this is the case in the @xmath35 baryon parity @xcite and similar @xcite models . ) for our purpose it is enough to consider @xmath36 where ( suppressing family indices ) @xmath37 below , we will show that this is indeed a natural choice in the models that we consider .",
    "_ rotations and lepton - number redefinitions : _ lepton number violation can be rotated from @xmath8 onto @xmath23 , introducing the lepton number violating terms the yukawa couplings are sometimes denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "our notation aims at stressing the relation in our case between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( see below ) . ]",
    "@xmath42e , \\label{wlnv}\\ ] ] where commutation with respect to generation indices is implied in the second yukawa term ( which vanishes in the case of one lepton generation ) .",
    "@xmath1-parity is now replaced , e.g. , by baryon parity .",
    "such rotations are useful when discussing the implications of the model at low energies ( where all relevant symmetries are broken )",
    ". the new yukawa couplings are not arbitrary in that case and lead to the same phenomenology .",
    "however , rotations are impossible if @xmath30 is invariant under a symmetry which does not commute with the @xmath43 symmetry of @xmath44 rotations in the field space , i.e. , a symmetry which distinguishes the higgs and lepton superfields .",
    "we will assume that this is the case at high energies , e.g. , at planckian scales .",
    "we will show later that such a `` non - commuting '' symmetry is , in fact , a desired feature and that it can be related to the ad hoc absence of an arbitrary @xmath40 ( and also to the absence of lepton number violation in the soft terms ) .",
    "in particular , one may not need to impose an additional symmetry on @xmath23 .",
    "note also that the rotation leading to ( [ wlnv ] ) is not scale invariant and that @xmath45 will regenerate lepton number violation in @xmath8 via renormalization group scaling .",
    "it suggests that one can define the sm lepton number consistently only at low - energies .",
    "for that reason , and as a result of our symmetry assumption , we distinguish between the high- ( mssm ) and low - energy ( sm ) definitions of the leptons .",
    "the former are defined by the superpotential ( [ wy ] ) while the latter will be chosen ( after all symmetries are broken and rotations are possible ) in most cases as the perpendicular directions to the relevant weak - scale expectation value .",
    "this distinction will prove as a useful model - building tool .    _",
    "the @xmath2-problem and the choice of a symmetry : _ an arbitrary ( high - energy ) vector with a magnitude @xmath46 could lead to highly suppressed neutrino masses and there is no need to significantly suppress @xmath47 etc .",
    "( this will be demonstrated in the following sections ) . in particular , the neutrino mass is related in our framework to the solution of the celebrated @xmath2-problem @xcite to which we alluded above , i.e. , explaining @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which is the manifestation of the correlation between the supersymmetry preserving [ with a natural scale of @xmath50 and softly breaking [ with an ad hoc scale @xmath51 ) ] sectors .",
    "the correlation is imposed by requiring the correct electroweak symmetry breaking pattern @xcite .",
    "( usually the problem is phrased in terms of @xmath52 . )",
    "we will adopt a somewhat ambitious approach and require that the solution to the @xmath2-problem is determined by the same symmetry that was proposed above [ and which does not commute with the @xmath43 ] .",
    "in particular , we will consider a continuous @xmath54 r - symmetry ( the @xmath1-charge is defined as above ) that is known to be relevant for the solution of the @xmath2-problem @xcite , and under which @xmath55 and @xmath56 effectively carry different @xmath1-charges . in principle , we could use other @xmath0 symmetries to break the @xmath43 , e.g. , a peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite or the stringy inspired @xmath0 s of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case @xmath21 could be forbidden by the new @xmath0 gauge symmetry but induced by weak - scale expectation values in a similar manner to the authors original proposal for the generation of @xmath55 .",
    "we will concentrate in this work on the @xmath54 case .",
    "generalization of our proposal to models in which other symmetries play a similar role in solving the @xmath2-problem is straightforward .",
    "_ operator classification : _ in the symmetry framework @xmath55 and @xmath57 are realized as nonrenormalizable operators ( nro s ) present in the effective low - energy superpotential @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-symmetry allows us to classify three categories of mass terms in @xmath30 [ which is normalized transformation law @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , for the scalar , fermion and auxiliary components of a chiral superfield @xmath61 with r - charge @xmath1 , respectively . ] to carry @xmath62charge @xmath63 :    [ mus ] @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    where we have assumed the standard @xmath1-charge assignments as above ( substituting @xmath67 ) , i.e. , @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    ". thus , the @xmath1-symmetry provides us with a convenient book - keeping tool .",
    "note that the proposal @xmath70 @xcite is trivially realized in this framework . generically",
    "( but see exceptions below ) , one expects that the higher @xmath1-charge @xmath2 carries the more suppressed it is . furthermore , since lepton number violation is in the form of nonrenormalizable operators , and based on dimensional arguments , one also expects that , e.g. , @xmath71 .",
    "[ note that @xmath72 . ]",
    "thus , @xmath23 is effectively @xmath41 with an accidental discrete @xmath73 symmetry .",
    "similar arguments hold for the dimensionless couplings in the kahler potential , and typically lepton number violation in the soft terms is also suppressed . as a result of the symmetry selection rules , @xmath1-number violation , and in particular , lepton number violation , is contained in @xmath8 as advocated .",
    "the singlet @xmath2-parameters may not be suppressed , and the right handed neutrino @xmath74 ( or other singlets ) and vector - like exotic @xmath61 and @xmath75 supermultiplets with standard @xmath1-charge assignments are expected to be heavy .",
    "( the latter points are , in fact , relevant for the dynamical suppression of the neutrino masses discussed below . )",
    "we are now in a position to outline our proposal : the @xmath54 symmetry selection rules require that there is a @xmath76 hierarchy between the symmetry violation in the supersymmetric mass terms and in the yukawa terms and the kahler potential . as a result",
    ", it leads to the generation of @xmath2 terms of the right magnitude , accidental @xmath73 symmetry in the yukawa terms , and to a consistent definition of the low - energy lepton number .",
    "in addition , the neutrino masses are suppressed dynamically .",
    "we will examine the above issues in greater detail and expand our discussion in the following sections .",
    "in section ii we briefly discuss possible realizations ( and their problems ) of the @xmath54 symmetry , and present some simple examples that realize ( or are exceptions to ) the main features discussed above , i.e. , the suppression of non - minimal yukawa interactions and the hierarchy among the different @xmath2 terms .",
    "we will show that the nature of the hierarchy depends on whether or not the relevant operators involve @xmath77-terms . in section iii",
    "we discuss the neutral fermion mass matrix and the sufficient conditions for small neutrino masses , which include the alignment ( in field space ) of @xmath78 with @xmath21 .",
    "we then proceed and show in section iv that the latter condition and @xmath79 are achieved in a straightforward manner in universal models with radiative ( electroweak ) symmetry breaking ( rsb ) @xcite via the `` dynamical alignment '' mechanism .",
    "( for simplicity , we discuss a model with only the third generation of leptons and quarks . )",
    "it is also pointed out that grand - unification relations , as well as an intermediate - scale right - handed neutrino , generically destabilize this result . in section",
    "v we show that lepton number ( and individual lepton number ) violations in the model are typically proportional to either the neutrino mass or to small mssm yukawa couplings , and thus , they are suppressed .",
    "we briefly address the issue of possible discovery channels , and stress that there could be an enhancement of dijet and multijet cross - sections .",
    "cosmology and astrophysics implications are discussed in section vi .",
    "it is shown that weak - scale neutrino mass generation implies that the supersymmetric partners ( superpartners ) of ordinary matter and gauge fields are not stable on cosmological time scales .",
    "we will alternate in our discussion between the high - energy ( sections ii and iv ) and low - energy ( sections iii , v and vi ) definitions of the leptons and lepton number , as appropriate . in section vii we comment on possible family dependencies in more complete models and on their implications .",
    "we conclude in section viii , where we suggest that the proposal for supersymmetric neutrino mass generation is most elegantly understood in terms of symmetry principles that are also relevant to the ( generalized ) @xmath2-problem , can be naturally incorporated in simple supersymmetric models , removes the need to ad hoc generate an intermediate scale for the right - handed neutrinos , e.g. , in string models , and requires one to consider unorthodox scenarios for supersymmetric particle astrophysics , cosmology , and for superpartner collider signatures .",
    "we have chosen a spontaneously broken @xmath54 symmetry as our primary tool in deriving selection rules for the low - energy effective theory .",
    "we also have shown above that it allows one to distinguish three classes of mass ( i.e. , @xmath2- ) parameters in the effective low - energy superpotential ; it distinguishes the ( high - scale ) lepton and higgs doublets ; and that , on the basis of dimensional arguments , non - singlet ( i.e. , lepton - number violating ) yukawa couplings are typically suppressed by an inverse power of the planck mass in comparison to non - singlet @xmath2-parameters .",
    "the presence of such a symmetry is intimately connected to ( dynamical ) supersymmetry breaking @xcite and the @xmath1-symmetry could play a natural rule in the solution of the ( either mssm or our generalized ) @xmath2-problem if the @xmath54 symmetry is unbroken and the @xmath2-problem is trivially solved @xcite . however , such models are strongly constrained and face many phenomenological ( e.g. , generation of a gluino mass ) and model - building ( e.g. , realization of rsb ) difficulties ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] @xcite .",
    "hence , our choice of `` book - keeping '' tool is well motivated .",
    "however , similarly to the peccei - quinn case @xcite , a spontaneously broken continuous @xmath1-symmetry implies an unwanted @xcite ( pseudo ) goldstone boson  the @xmath1-axion .",
    "the troublesome presence of the @xmath1-axion can be resolved @xmath80 if it is an invisible axion , i.e. , the @xmath1-symmetry is broken at a scale @xmath81 gev ( from stellar evolution ) and below the planck scale @xmath82 gev ( from its contribution to the energy density ) @xcite ( a higher bound @xmath83 may exist in some cases @xcite ) ; @xmath84 if the axion receives its mass from nro s that explicitly break the symmetry - charge and which is perhaps needed to cancel the vacuum energy . in that case",
    "the axion mass is related to the size of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "in fact , explicit breaking by a large constant in the gravitational sector is a common solution to the @xmath54 problem in supergravity models , e.g. , in the polonyi model @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite ; @xmath85 if the symmetry is gauged ( and anomaly free ) at planckian scales @xcite ; or @xmath86 if the axion is rendered heavy by different means than the higgs mechanism which operates in @xmath85 .    the first option could be the natural choice if the low - energy global symmetry results from an anomalous high - energy @xmath0 ( e.g. , in a string theory ) , and thus , could be stable with respect to gravitational corrections . in that case @xmath87 where the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath88 is the scale parameter that enters nro s with positive powers , and thus , controls the size of couplings in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "if the axion scale is related to a typical supergravity breaking scale then it naturally falls in this range @xcite .",
    "the second option is motivated by the observation that global symmetries are not likely to be exact in the presence of gravity or if the @xmath54 symmetry is accidental and due to a higher symmetry and renormalizability @xcite , but it implies that a priory we do not have an handle on the choice of nro s .",
    "thus , it may undermine our motivation .",
    "nevertheless , one could still distinguish @xmath89mev@xmath29 operators , that are sufficient to generate an acceptable axion mass , from @xmath90 operators , which are the relevant ones in our case .",
    "[ recall that the @xmath91 s need not be suppressed necessarily more than the ordinary @xmath92 parameter and could be @xmath93 . ] in this scenario there are no constraints on @xmath88 .",
    "( note that if the axion is hidden , i.e. , with only gravitational interactions with ordinary matter , then effects of any operator that may be needed to render it massive are suppressed in the observable sector by an additional inverse power of @xmath94 . )",
    "the third option is quite attractive .",
    "the symmetry is anomaly free and the goldstone boson is not an axion .",
    "however , the anomaly cancelation equations involve the gauge fermions and the gravitino , in addition to the ordinary , exotic and hidden matter fermions ( and similarly the @xmath14-terms ) .",
    "it was recently shown that the symmetry must be broken at a planckian scale so that one can tune to a flat @xmath14-term direction @xmath95 [ and avoid @xmath96 masses for ordinary fields ] @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath97 the anomaly equations are difficult to solve and require ( many ) new sm singlet fields and/or exotic fields with non - trivial sm charge assignments ( and , in some cases , non - standard and family - dependent @xmath1-charge assignments for the ordinary sm fields ) @xcite . while the singlet fields could be hidden in the hidden sector , @xmath96 mass terms for the ( observable - sector ) exotics are forbidden by the symmetry , and in the existing examples with exotics there are @xmath89tev@xmath29 colored fields .",
    "we will not consider explicitly models with such fields and will constrain our investigation to the model with minimal matter content .",
    "however , we note that unless such fields interact with @xmath44 , they are irrelevant for our purposes and do not alter our discussion .",
    "lastly , the fourth option could be realized , e.g. , if the axion is a hidden - sector field and the @xmath54 is anomalous with respect to a hidden sector qcd group .",
    "the axion would then acquire a large mass ( of order of the hidden sector qcd scale @xmath98 gev , assuming dynamical supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector ) @xcite .",
    "in this case one also expects @xmath99    below , we will not promote any option in particular , but comment on their different implications where relevant .",
    "we will assume standard @xmath1-charge assignments , unless otherwise is specified , that the scale @xmath88 is in the range suggested by ( [ theta1 ] )  ( [ theta3 ] ) , and that the non - vanishing fields are hidden fields ( with only gravitational interactions with ordinary matter ) .",
    "the latter is motivated by the assumption of gauge confinement and dynamical supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector , and as discussed above , could ease some of the problems .",
    "having discussed the possible frameworks in which the symmetry can be realized , we now turn to a discussion of some examples .",
    "nro s can be induced in our case by scalar vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) , non - vanishing @xmath77-terms , and fermion condensates @xcite , leading to many possible scenarios which would relate differently to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "since we assume that only sm hidden singlets participate , then the operators ( which are nonrenormalizable in that case ) are suppressed by powers of the planck mass . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that @xmath100 gev ) is the only large scale suppressing the operators .",
    "note also that while the form of the operators ( i.e. , the selection rules ) is dictated by the symmetries [ and in particular , @xmath54 ] , their non - vanishing values ( i.e. , the vev s ) may be a result of @xmath54 breaking or of the breaking of a different symmetry at a lower scale . in the latter case @xmath88 could be lower then the @xmath54 scale .",

    "for example , there could be a single production of a scalar lepton in hadron colliders which would then decay to two jets or two jets and either like - sign dileptons or ( degraded ) missing energy ( for example , see ref .",
    "such decays serve , in general , as a test of all supersymmetric lepton number violating models ( assuming that supersymmetry is established and characterized by experiment ) in both hadron and electron colliders .    of particular interest",
    "is the case in which the scalar neutrino @xmath382 ( that can be singly produced ) is the lsp .",
    "the gauginos and higgsinos are then heavy and the sneutrino would decay exclusively to two jets ( assuming @xmath383 ) .",
    "its charged @xmath225 partner , which has a similar mass , will also decay preferably to jets .",
    "superpartner decays are characterized in that case by a @xmath384 signal . in the case of the tevatron , for example",
    ", the lsp dijet signal[multiblock footnote omitted ] could be only one order of magnitude below the corresponding qcd signal @xcite ( but would be further suppressed if the couplings are small ) .",
    "however , the enhancement of the total dijet cross - section is more significant ( and is smeared over a larger energy range ) if there are more than one relevant threshold [ e.g. , its charged @xmath225 partner and possibly scalars of all three lepton doublets ] .",
    "these observations may require further attention which is only weakly constrained ( in the absence of lepton number violation ) , but is forbidden here .",
    "] in view of recent indications of enhancements in the dijet inclusive cross section @xcite and mass spectrum @xcite measurements .",
    "in particular , the situation here is quite different than in @xmath1-parity conserving supersymmetric theories , where any new contributions to the inclusive dijet cross section are only at the loop level and were shown recently to be small or negative@xcite .",
    "we concluded above that no significant constraints arise on the model from laboratory and collider data , but stressed the unconventional decays and signatures of the supersymmetric particles .",
    "we also pointed out that the lsp is not expected to be stable . here , we will survey some astrophysical and cosmological aspects of the model .",
    "we also elaborate on the lsp and neutrino decays .",
    "in particular , we show that the lsp ( and thus , all other mssm superpartners ) is cosmologically irrelevant in any supersymmetric model with explicit ( weak - scale ) lepton number violation which is the source of the neutrino mass .",
    "radiative neutrino decays are shown to lead to only moderate constraints on the order parameter @xmath213 ( unless @xmath261 is large ) .",
    "we do not consider here some issues which are more model dependent , e.g. , that of the primordial baryon asymmetry in the universe ( but see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "_ neutrino oscillations : _ current observations imply not only massive neutrinos but also neutrino mixing , so that the neutrinos could oscillate @xcite .",
    "indeed , we find model dependent mixing between the three neutrinos .",
    "it was recently pointed out @xcite that the mass and mixing patterns in the models with supersymmetric neutrino masses are relevant for the solution of the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems @xcite .",
    "most importantly , we would like to stress that the patterns that arise could be quite different from those in typical see - saw and similar models .",
    "they are not proportional to any yukawa couplings and the hierarchy among the neutrino masses is not related to either the hierarchy among the quarks or the charged leptons .",
    "_ lsp decays : _ since @xmath73 is effectively broken to the baryon parity in our models , the lsp , i.e. , the lightest neutralino or scalar , is not stable but decays @xcite through small mixing ( if it is a neutralino ) , and more probably , via @xmath366 and @xmath367 interactions . in order to render the lsp stable on a cosmological time scale ( @xmath386 sec )",
    "one would have to fine tune @xmath387 for a neutralino lsp ( and even more so for a scalar lsp ) , and we neglected the decay via mixing which is further suppressed .",

    "it would imply , in our case , an unacceptable fine tuning of @xmath213 .",
    "but moreover , even if the neutrino masses are generated by only yukawa loops @xcite , they would be essentially massless given the constrain ( [ lsp ] ) , which is thus unacceptable .",
    "we therefore conclude that the lsp decays on short time scales and is cosmologically irrelevant .",
    "( we find that a neutralino lsp could , however , still be stable in our model on collider scales . )",

    "_ dark matter sources : _ one might have hoped that the model would provide a closed framework in which the primary candidates for cold and hot dark matter , the lsp and the neutrino , respectively , are related by mixing and/or decay chains and thus , have correlated abundances .",
    "such a scenario could make , for example , critical density models for the universe more plausible .",
    "however , we have concluded above that the lsp is cosmologically irrelevant and the only ( hot ) dark matter candidates in the model are the two heavier neutrinos ( which in some sense are the actual lsp ) .",
    "this is somewhat a disappointing aspect of the model .",
    "nevertheless , there could still be other sources for cold dark matter , e.g. , light components of the axion superfield ( as was proposed in the case of a peccei - quinn axion @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , it is interesting to note that our models could reverse the generic situation in the @xmath160 gev ) lepton number conserving models which typically suffer from a slow lsp annihilation rate @xcite .",
    "throughout this work we have assumed universal @xmath1-charge assignment to all matter fields . as a result ,",
    "the vector @xmath405 was @xmath307 symmetric .",
    "there are many ways in which the @xmath307 could be broken , most obviously so , if the @xmath1-charge assignment is family dependent .",
    "it was suggested that a family dependent assignment may be needed in order to cancel the anomalies of a gauged @xmath54 theory and that it is related to the fermion mass problem ( but , as we noted above , it could lead to dangerous @xmath14-terms ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite yukawa operators involving the first two families were forbidden by the assignment @xmath406 but the possibility of dynamical couplings was not discussed .",
    "a more ambitious program was pursued in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was suggested that all yukawa couplings ( but not @xmath21 ) are dynamical variables that depend on the @xmath54 breaking parameter @xmath88 ( in a similar manner to the horizontal symmetry approach @xcite ) .",
    "however , being an @xmath1-symmetry complicates the anomaly cancelation equations and ref.@xcite chose not to consider ( and satisfy ) the complete set of equations , in particular , those involving hidden fields .",
    "given the ambiguous status of the gauged @xmath54 , we chose the simplest possible @xmath54 charge assignments and did not consider the mssm yukawa couplings as dynamical variables .",
    "nevertheless , it is very likely that the solution of the fermion mass problem , and in particular , if it relies on some symmetry principles and/or if the yukawa couplings are dynamical variables , would break explicitly the @xmath307 symmetry in @xmath8 as well , e.g. , by forbidding certain field combinations .",
    "it could also break the higgs - lepton soft mass universality from a non - minimal kahler functions or @xmath14-terms , in which case the dynamical alignment would fail .",
    "however , the latter breaking is constrained ( from fcnc ) to @xmath407 type breaking of the @xmath307 , and one can impose the additional condition that breaking the above @xmath307 by the leptonic soft - terms is negligible . for example , this would be the case if the @xmath307 is broken mainly in the right - handed lepton singlet sector ( but then @xmath8 is still @xmath307 symmetric ) , or if it is a global or discrete symmetry ( and the kahler function is , e.g. , minimal ) .",
    "therefore , we do not consider the @xmath307 symmetry as a necessary result of our model .    the above discussion also affects the phenomenology of the model .",
    "in particular , if @xmath408 and only @xmath233 number is ( significantly ) broken , then the constraints on @xmath213 are quite weak .",
    "( models in that spirit were discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the neutrino mass could arise from a generalized supersymmetric mass term @xmath24 in the weak - scale superpotential , on the condition that higgs - lepton universality in the scalar potential is broken only weakly .",
    "this is indeed the situation , for example , in universal models for the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "the restricted form of @xmath1-parity breaking in the model was realized , as an example , in the framework of a spontaneously broken @xmath54 symmetry , which is often present in models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the symmetry framework provides also a solution to the generalized @xmath2-problem while suppressing lepton number violation in the yukawa interactions and in the kahler potential . in hidden sector models",
    "the @xmath54 scale is an intermediate scale .",
    "the neutrino mass is related to the intermediate scale physics in that case in a very different fashion than in see - saw models . in particular",
    ", it could be a result of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it offers a new mechanism for the neutrino mass generation in supergravity and superstring theories , which does not require to introduce any intermediate - scale see - saw structure .",
    "the neutrino mass suppression is achieved dynamically ( and is sensitive to @xmath261 ) .",
    "the resulting mass range for the neutrino agrees with not only the weaker collider limits but also with cosmological considerations .",
    "the dynamical suppression is typically ( but not always ) destroyed in grand - unified models , models with an intermediate right - handed neutrino , and in models with arbitrary lepton - number violating yukawa couplings , once renormalization effects are taken into account .",
    "we were able to define the sm lepton number at the weak - scale ( after all symmetries were broken ) .",
    "the resulting yukawa superpotential has an accidental @xmath35 baryon - parity symmetry , but the yukawa couplings are not arbitrary and , in general , satisfy all experimental constraints .",
    "one can still constrain the models two order parameters . however , given the above and the large number of parameters in supersymmetric models , the constraints are mild ( unless @xmath252 ) .",
    "1 .   the patterns of neutrino masses that arise could be quite different from those that arise in typical see - saw models .",
    "the lsp is not stable on cosmological time - scales , an observation which holds more generally in supersymmetric models with weak - scale origin of the neutrino masses .",
    "3 .   if the lsp is a scalar neutrino it most probably decays in the detector , enhancing jet production and leading to a typical @xmath384 signal .      it is pleasure to thank herbi dreiner , ralf hempfling , and yossi nir for discussions of their works , and to paul langacker and masahiro yamaguchi for their comments on the manuscript .",

    "<S> in supersymmetric models a tree - level neutrino mass could originate from the ( weak - scale ) superpotential . </S>",
    "<S> we propose and examine a realization of that idea , which arises naturally in the framework of a spontaneously broken @xmath0 @xmath1-symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the solution to the neutrino mass problem could shed light in this framework on the possible resolution of the @xmath2 problem . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the suppression of the neutrino mass in comparison to the weak scale arises dynamically and need not be encoded in the superpotential . </S>",
    "<S> the latter mechanism operates , for example , in universal models for the soft supersymmetry breaking terms . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological and cosmological implications of the model are also discussed , some of which are shown to hold more generally . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that future signatures could include observable enhancement of dijet and multijet production rates and a correlation between the supersymmetric and neutrino spectra . </S>"
