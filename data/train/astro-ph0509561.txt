    "ngc  205 is a low - luminosity , early - type , dwarf galaxy in the local group and is one of the brightest nearby examples of a dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxy . a close satellite of the large spiral galaxy andromeda ( m31 ) , ngc  205 has a projected separation to m31 of merely @xmath5 or 8kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig_masks ] ) ; the physical separation between ngc  205 and m31 is estimated to be @xmath6kpc @xcite .",
    "this separation distance is intermediate between that of the milky way and its dwarf satellite galaxies sagittarius ( 24kpc ; * ? ? ? * ) and the large magellanic cloud ( 50kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational evidence such as isophotal twisting at large radii @xcite , recent star formation @xcite , and a steadily increasing velocity dispersion with radius @xcite suggests that ngc  205 is tidally interacting with its parent galaxy .",
    "however , inside the effective radius , @xmath7kpc ) , ngc  205 exhibits regular surface brightness and kinematic profiles typical of a normal de galaxy .",
    "ngc  205 therefore offers a unique opportunity to study both the internal dynamics of a nearby de galaxy while providing a detailed view of a satellite undergoing disruption .",
    "a crucial question for current galaxy formation theories is to what extent the accretion of dwarf satellite galaxies contributes to the growth of massive galactic halos @xcite .",
    "the m31 galaxy and its associated dwarf satellite system are an excellent laboratory to study this question in detail : m31 is the nearest massive galaxy external to the milky way in which current observing techniques are able to resolve individual stars . @xcite and @xcite",
    "first detected evidence for tidal streams in the halo of m31 based on wide - area star - count maps . @xcite and @xcite provided confirmation that the stars in these streams are dynamically related and have a small enough velocity dispersion to have feasibly been stripped from a dwarf - sized galaxy .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the globular cluster g1 , one of the brightest globular clusters belonging to m31 , is the remnant core of a nucleated dwarf galaxy based on its internal dynamics and stellar populations ( however see @xcite ) . from these observations , it is clear that dwarf satellite disruption must contribute to the build - up of m31 s halo ; detailed study of current , on - going interactions between m31 and its satellites should help quantify what fraction of halo material is attributed to this process .",
    "galaxy formation scenarios for the origin of de galaxies lie broadly in two very distinct categories : ( 1 )  des are old , primordial objects , and ( 2 )  des have recently evolved or transformed from a progenitor galaxy population @xcite .",
    "dwarf elliptical galaxies are highly clustered @xcite the majority of des in the local universe are found in dense galaxy clusters .",
    "kinematic studies of des in the virgo and fornax clusters suggest a large range in their kinematic properties , from rotationally - supported galaxies to des with no detectable major axis rotation @xcite .",
    "these results , in particular the abundance of de galaxies with a complete lack of rotation , have so far been difficult to explain in the context of current formation models . the three bright local group de satellites ngc  205 , ngc  147 , and ngc  185 provide an excellent opportunity to study de kinematics in greater detail and to larger radii than their cluster counterparts . in this paper , we present kinematics for the brightest of the local group des , ngc  205 .",
    "the absolute magnitude of ngc  205 is @xmath8 .",
    "it has a nearly exponential surface brightness profile @xcite , characteristic of de galaxies . as a result ,",
    "ngc  205 has a far more diffuse appearance than the other bright m31 satellite galaxy , m32 , which has a similar absolute magnitude but is classified as a compact elliptical .",
    "near the center of this galaxy , inside a radius of @xmath9 ( 0.24kpc ) , ngc  205 contains dust @xcite , atomic and molecular gas @xcite , and a number of ob associations implying a recent episode of star formation in the past 100 myr @xcite . beyond this radius ,",
    "ngc  205 is gas and dust - free and is composed of an intermediate stellar population @xcite , typical for similarly - sized des in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "early dynamical studies suggested that ngc  205 had negligible internal rotation velocity .",
    "dynamical measurements by @xcite placed an upper limit on the rotation velocity of @xmath10 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath11 . combined with observations of two other local group des , this established the paradigm that de galaxies are supported primarily by anisotropic velocity dispersions",
    ". however , @xcite more recently measured the major - axis rotation of ngc  205 out to twice the effective radius , measuring a rotation speed @xmath12 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the central velocity dispersion of ngc  205 has a value of @xmath13 km  s@xmath2 @xcite , increasing with radius to 42 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath14 @xcite and 50 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "assuming an isotropic spheroid model , @xcite inferred a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath16 for ngc  205 , similar to the mass - to - light ratios inferred for a sample of virgo and fornax cluster de galaxies based on more sophisticated dynamical modeling @xcite .",
    "these ratios are consistent with that of a modestly old stellar population with no dark matter .",
    "this lack of dark matter in the inner region is in stark contrast to the much larger mass - to - light ratios inferred for fainter dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies in the local group , such as the draco and ursa minor dsph , which appear to be dark - matter - dominated even in their central region @xcite .",
    "integrated - light spectroscopy can not probe the kinematics of de galaxies much beyond the effective radius due to their characteristic low surface brightness ( @xmath17 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) .",
    "unlike dwarf irregular galaxies , des are devoid of gas at large radii so their outer kinematics can not be studied via hi gas dynamics .",
    "other kinematical probes exist at large radius , such as globular clusters @xcite and planetary nebulae @xcite , but their small numbers make these poor kinematic tracers .",
    "the proximity of ngc  205 presents a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of a de galaxy out to much larger radii than possible in more distant systems : via spectroscopy of individual red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .    in this paper , we present accurate radial velocities for 725  rgb stars in the local group de galaxy ngc  205 measured via keck / deimos multi - slit spectroscopy .",
    "we present dynamics of this galaxy well beyond the inferred tidal radius , twice the radial extent of previous measurements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec_data ] we discuss target selection for our deimos slitmasks , the observing procedure and data reduction . in  [ sec_dyn ] , a detailed kinematic analysis of ngc  205 is presented along with a maximum - likelihood estimate of the kinematic contamination from stars in m31 .",
    "finally , in  [ sec_orbit ] , we discuss the implications of our kinematic observations for the tidal interaction between ngc  205 and m31 .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a distance modulus to ngc  205 of @xmath18 , i.e. ,  a distance of @xmath19kpc , as determined by @xcite via the tip of the rgb method ; this places ngc  205 40kpc further than its parent galaxy m31 .",
    "stars were selected for spectroscopy according to their probability of being a rgb star in ngc  205 .",
    "stars were selected based on canada - france - hawaii telescope cfh12k mosaic imaging in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands kindly provided by ( * ? ? ? * private communication ) .",
    "the ccd mosaic covers a @xmath22 region centered on ngc  205 with @xmath23 pixels .",
    "the images were obtained in sub - arcsecond seeing conditions .",
    "stellar photometry from these images extends 2  mag below the tip of the rgb .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for this region is shown in figure  [ fig_cmd ] .",
    "a broad rgb is seen extending to very red colors ( @xmath24 ) ; the reddest of these stars are likely to be metal - rich / reddened m31 disk rgb contaminants @xcite .",
    "the vertical ridge near @xmath25 is due to foreground milky way stars .",
    "the spatial distribution of stars is shown in figure  [ fig_imvel ] .",
    "the gaps between cfh12k ccd chips are @xmath26 wide .",
    "the apparent hole in stellar density map near the center of ngc  205 is due to crowding ; the stellar density increase in the lower left corner is due to the presence of field rgb stars belonging to m31 .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the rgb is @xmath27 . at the assumed distance of ngc  205 ,",
    "the apparent magnitude of this stellar population is @xmath28 . since metallicity variations within ngc  205 will cause a spread in the colors of its rgb stars , we select spectroscopic targets based primarily on apparent magnitude .",
    "highest priority in the spectroscopic target list was assigned to stars between @xmath29 .",
    "second priority was given to stars between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; lowest priority was assigned to objects @xmath32 . to minimize galactic foreground contamination , targets were required to have @xmath33 .",
    "stars with photometric errors larger than @xmath34 were rejected , as were stars having neighbors of equal or greater brightness within a radius @xmath35 .",
    "the photometric criteria used for spectroscopic target selection are shown in figure  [ fig_cmd ] .",
    "four multislit masks were observed on the nights of 2003 september 30 and october 1 with the keck  ii 10-m telescope and the deimos multi - object spectrograph @xcite .",
    "three of the four masks ( n205 - 1 , n205 - 2 , n205 - 3 ) were designed to be observed in a conventional mode , while a fourth mask was designed to have multiple tiers of spectra as described in  [ sssec_multitier ] .",
    "science exposures for all four masks were @xmath36s per mask ; the average seeing fwhm during the spectroscopic observations was @xmath37 .    in figure  [ fig_masks ] , the placement of the four deimos slit - masks is shown relative to a digitized palomar optical sky survey image of ngc  205 .",
    "each deimos multislit mask covers a rectangular area of @xmath38 .",
    "two slit - masks ( n205 - 1 and n205 - 4 ) were positioned on the center on ngc  205 with the long axis of the mask along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the centers of masks n205 - 2 and n205 - 3 were placed @xmath39 to the south - east and north - west of ngc  205 , respectively .",
    "the long axis of these two masks were roughly placed along the direction of tidal distortion .",
    "the direction of tidal distortion was determined from surface brightness ellipse fitting by @xcite based on wide - field @xmath40-band photometry .",
    "the locus of semi - major axes of the ellipse fitting forms a gentle s curve which we plot in figure  [ fig_masks ] and refer to as the major - axis of ngc  205 ( see  [ sec_dyn ] ) .",
    "slitlets in each mask have the same the position angle as the overall mask  i.e",
    ".  we did not use tilted slits . in table  2",
    ", we list the observing details for each mask .",
    "the three conventional deimos slit - masks ( n205 - 1 , n205 - 2 , n205 - 3 ) were designed to be observed with the 1200  line  mm@xmath2 grating covering a wavelength region @xmath41 .",
    "the spectral dispersion of this setup is @xmath42 , and the resulting spectral resolution , taking into account the anamorphic distortion factor of 0.706 , is @xmath43 ( fwhm ) .",
    "this wavelength range includes the triplet lines which are expected to be strong in absorption for our targeted rgb stars .",
    "slitlets were @xmath37 wide to match the typical seeing conditions while maintaining good wavelength resolution .",
    "the spatial scale is @xmath44  per pixel and the spectral dispersion of @xmath42 per pixel . to allow adequate sky subtraction ,",
    "the minimum slit length was @xmath45 ; the minimum spatial separation between slit ends was @xmath46 ( three pixels ) .    using the above input parameters and the target list described in  [ subsec_targets ] , slitmasks were created using the deimos dsimulatorphillips / deimos_ref / masks.html ] slitmask design software . for each slitmask",
    "the software starts with the highest priority input targets and automatically fills in the mask area to the extent possible and filling in the remaining space on the slitmask with lower priority targets .",
    "an average of nearly 200 slitlets were placed on each mask ( see table  2 ) . a handful of targets were deliberately included on multiple masks .",
    "these overlapping targets are used to quantify measurement errors in  [ subsec_rvel ] .",
    "the deimos slitmask n205 - 4 was designed for use with a blocking filter centered on the  triplet region .",
    "the blocking filter allows multiple tiers of slitlets to placed on a single mask increasing the observing efficiency by a factor of 23 over conventional deimos masks .",
    "the  blocking filter has a central wavelength of @xmath47 and is @xmath48 wide . in combination with the 831  line  mm@xmath2 grating",
    ", the spectral dispersion of this setup is @xmath49 , and the resulting spectral resolution is @xmath50 ( fwhm ) .",
    "two and a half tiers of spectra are possible without significant overlap in the wavelength region @xmath51 .",
    "three full tiers of spectra are not possible because the deimos field - of - view is narrower in the middle as compared to the ends .",
    "the width and typical length of the slitlets are the same as the conventional masks above .",
    "this mask was designed by running dsimulator three times over the mask . in each pass , slitlets were placed on targets in a row running along the spatial axis of the mask to maximize the number of slitlets . for each pass of dsimulator ,",
    "the region of the ccd detector plane occupied by the spectra of all the slitlets was calculated , the spectroscopic targets in this region excluded , and the resulting target list fed into the next pass .",
    "a total of 332  slitlets were placed on the n205 - 4 mask . the tier pattern of slitlets can be seen in the spatial distribution of targets in figure  [ fig_imvel ] .",
    "spectra from the three conventional deimos multi - slit masks were reduced using the spec2d software pipeline ( version  1.1.4 ) developed by the deep2 team at the university of california - berkeley for that survey .",
    "a detailed description of the reductions can be found in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the flat - field exposures are used to rectify the curved raw spectra into rectangular arrays by applying small shifts and interpolating in the spatial direction . a one - dimensional slit function correction and two - dimensional flat - field and fringing correction",
    "are applied to each slitlet . using the deimos optical model as a starting point",
    ", a two - dimensional wavelength solution is determined from the arc lamp exposures with residuals of order @xmath52 .",
    "each slitlet is then sky - subtracted exposure by exposure using a b - spline model for the sky .",
    "the individual exposures of the slitlet are averaged with cosmic - ray rejection and inverse - variance weighting .",
    "finally one dimensional spectra are extracted for all science targets using the optimal scheme of @xcite and are rebinned into logarithmic wavelength bins with 15 km  s@xmath2  per pixel .",
    "sample one - dimensional spectra are shown in figure  [ fig_spec ] .",
    "spectra from the multi - tier mask ngc  205 - 4 were reduced using a combination of iraf multi- and long - slit tasks similar to the method described in @xcite . the flat - field exposure for this mask",
    "was used to trace the ends of each slitlet .",
    "the apall task was used in `` strip '' mode to extract and rectify two - dimensional rectangular strips for each slitlet ; a similar extraction was applied to the arc lamp calibration and science frames .",
    "data reduction proceeded on these rectified strips .",
    "each strip was divided by its corresponding normalized flat - field image .",
    "individual science exposures were cleaned of cosmic rays and combined .",
    "a wavelength solution was determined for each slitlet from the combined kr / ar / ne / xe arc lamp spectrum and was applied to the data .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were then extracted from each strip and rebinned into logarithmic wavelength bins with 20 km  s@xmath2  per pixel .",
    "radial velocities were measured for spectra extracted from the four deimos masks by cross - correlating the observed spectra with a series of high signal - to - noise stellar templates originally created for the sloan digital sky survey covering a wide range of stellar spectral type @xcite .",
    "these templates were rebinned to match the final wavelength resolution of the observations of 15 and 20 km  s@xmath2  per pixel for the conventional and multi - tier masks , respectively .",
    "the science and template spectra were continuum - subtracted ; the template was then shifted and scaled to minimize the reduced-@xmath53 .",
    "a heliocentric correction was applied to all the measured radial velocities .",
    "the fitted velocities were visually inspected and assigned a quality code to indicate the reliability of the measured redshift and the overall quality of the spectrum .",
    "radial velocities for individual stars were successfully measured for 769 of the 869 extracted spectra .",
    "of the 100 spectra for which we did not measure a redshift , 51 spectra were unusable due to bad columns or vignetting and 49 spectra had insufficient signal - to - noise ratios to determine a redshift .",
    "of the spectra with measured velocities , 3 were background galaxies and 41 were duplicate measurements .",
    "duplicate measurements are used to estimate our velocity error bars as discussed below .",
    "the final sample consists of 725  unique stellar radial velocity measurements .",

    "assuming the measurement uncertainty is the same for each member of the pair , the radial velocity error for an individual measurement is @xmath54 times smaller than the rms of the difference , or @xmath55  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the rms difference between the conventional and multi - tier mask is 21.7 km  s@xmath2 ; this rms difference is larger than the conventional masks due to lower spectral resolution and the smaller available wavelength region in the multi - tier design .",

    ", we fit a gaussian profile to the combined distribution of velocities ( figure  [ fig_vhist ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the fitted gaussian has a central velocity of @xmath57 km  s@xmath2 in agreement with the systemic velocity of ngc  205 measured above , and a velocity width of @xmath58 km  s@xmath2 in agreement with the average velocity dispersion of ngc  205 measured by @xcite . in the four top panels of figure  [ fig_vhist ] we plot the scaled gaussian profile",
    "; the excess of stars in mask n205 - 2 and n205 - 3 is clearly visible to the right and left , respectively of the main velocity peak . in all four masks , there are a small number of stars with velocities less negative than ngc  205 due to foreground contamination , while the tail of stars to more negative velocities are primarily m31 halo stars whose systemic velocity is @xmath59 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we estimate m31 contamination fractions in our sample in  [ subsec_m31 ] .    a semi - major axis distance is assigned to each slitlet based on its minimum distance to the major axis of ngc  205 .",
    "the major - axis of ngc  205 is shown in figure  [ fig_imvel ] and was determined from surface brightness ellipse fitting by @xcite based on wide - field @xmath40-band images of ngc  205 , corrected for the underlying light of m31 .",
    "the major - axis of ngc  205 forms a gentle s curve as plotted in figure  [ fig_imvel ] . for each slitlet",
    ", we determine its minimum distance to the major - axis and assign the semi - major axis length ( a ) at the point .",
    "although there are alternative methods to assign this distance ( e.g.  the semi - major distance corresponding to the nearest elliptical isophote ) , this method most closely resembles integrated - light spectroscopy of more distant des to which we will compare our results .      in figure  [ fig_vp ] , we present the major - axis velocity profile for ngc  205 determined from the combined velocity measurements of rgb stars .",
    "individual stellar velocity measurements are shown in the top panel of this figure . to determine the ensemble major - axis velocity profile , individual measurements were binned into minimum @xmath9 radial bins with 25 or more stars per bin .",
    "the velocity in each bin was determined by simultaneously fitting a double gaussian profile to the distribution of stars in that bin . to account for contamination from m31 stars , one of the two fitted gaussian profiles",
    "had a fixed mean and velocity width of -300 km  s@xmath2  and 150 km  s@xmath2 , respectively , corresponding to best estimates for m31 s halo ( see  [ subsec_m31 ] ) .",
    "we fit for the width and mean of the second gaussian profile to determine both the velocity and velocity dispersion of ngc  205 in each radial bin .",
    "the relative height of these two profiles is fixed based on the m31 contamination fraction determined by maximum likelihood fitting in  [ subsec_m31 ] .",
    "we have also run fits in which the contamination fraction is a free parameter which does not change the resulting profile appreciably .",
    "the resulting velocity and velocity dispersion profile as a function of radius is shown in the bottom two panels of figure  [ fig_vp ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile is determined using a coarser binning scheme of 50 or more stars per radial bins .",
    "error bars were computed based on number statistics in each radial bin which dominate over the radial velocity measurement errors of individual stars .",
    "we list the velocity and velocity dispersion as a function of semi - major axis distance , right ascension and declination in table  4 .",
    "we determine the maximum major - axis rotation velocity , @xmath60 , for ngc  205 by differencing the maximum / minimum velocity in the upper - left quadrant and lower - right quadrant of figure  [ fig_vp ] , and dividing this number by two .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity for ngc  205 is @xmath61 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the peak rotation velocity occurs at slightly different radii on either side of the galaxy , with an average radius of @xmath62kpc ) .",
    "our value is somewhat smaller , but within the 1-sigma error bars , of the value measured by @xcite of @xmath63 km  s@xmath2  at @xmath64 based on integrated - light measurements . the simien & prugniel data hint at a flattening in the velocity profile , but the integrated - light data is noisy at these large radii .",
    "we observe this turnover conclusively and note that @xmath60 is the physical , rather than a observational , maximum rotation velocity .",
    "previous observations of de galaxies have not reached sufficient radii to observe a definite turnover in the rotation curve ; this is the first de galaxy in which the _ maximum _ rotation velocity has been measured .",
    "we plot the ratio of the maximum rotational velocity to the average velocity dispersion ( @xmath65 ) versus ellipticity in figure  [ fig_vsigma ] .",
    "we assume an ellipticity for ngc  205 of @xmath66 @xcite , and a velocity dispersion of @xmath67 km  s@xmath2determined from our profile excluding data beyond the tidal radius . the observed ratio for ngc  205 is @xmath68 . at the ellipticity of ngc  205 , the expected ratio for an oblate , isotropic , rotationally - flattened body seen",

    "the velocity profile of ngc  205 turns over ; stars beyond this radius rotate in a direction opposite that of the main galaxy body .",
    "this turnover is in the sense that stars on the side of ngc  205 closest to m31 move with more negative velocities ( approaching the systemic velocity of m31 ) and stars on the farside move with less negative velocities .",
    "the turnover radius is coincident with the onset of isophotal twisting as observed by @xcite , suggesting that the outer dynamics of ngc  205 have been affected by the processes of tidal stripping .",

    "we note that these best fitting m31 halo parameters are in good agreement with the measured m31 halo velocity dispersion by @xcite and an @xmath97 halo surface brightness profile .    in the right panel of figure  [ fig_maxlike ]",
    ", we plot the fractional contamination in our kinematic sample from the m31 halo as a function of distance from the center of ngc  205 using the best fit parameters determined above .",
    "at the center of ngc  205 , the best estimate of the contamination from m31 is 6% ; this corresponds to 1.5 out of 25 stars per radial bin .",
    "on the side of ngc  205 closest to m31 the contamination is 20% , while on the farside the contamination is less than 3% .",
    "the average halo contamination fraction for our sample is 6.5% .",
    "the outer dynamics of ngc  205 place significant constraint on the tidal interaction between ngc  205 and its parent galaxy m31 .",
    "while the main body of ngc  205 is rotating with a maximum velocity of 11 km  s@xmath2 , the major - axis velocity profile turns over abruptly at a radius of @xmath98kpc ) ; stars at larger radii are moving in the opposite direction than the main galaxy body .",
    "the turnover radius coincides with the onset of isophotal twisting @xcite and a downward break in the surface brightness profile @xcite .",
    "both features have been demonstrated by choi  et  al .  to be hallmarks of tidal stripping .",
    "we make a simple estimate of the tidal radius of ngc  205 , assuming ngc  205 and m31 to be point masses .",
    "we adopt a physical separation distance between these two galaxies of @xmath99kpc , the mass of m31 inside this distance of @xmath100 @xcite and the total mass of ngc  205 @xmath101 ( calculated from the maximum rotation velocity and velocity dispersion at the turnover radius ) .",
    "the tidal radius is calculated to be @xmath102 ( 1.0kpc ) .",
    "the observed velocity turnover in ngc  205 , at roughly this distance , is therefore due to tidal stripping from m31 ; stars beyond this radius are no longer bound to ngc  205 .",
    "the stellar motion beyond the tidal radius of ngc  205 suggests that it is on a prograde encounter with its parent galaxy : the spin angular momentum vector and the orbital angular momentum vector are parallel .",
    "the eventual destruction of a satellite on a prograde orbit is expected to proceed more slowly and create less spectacular tidal tails than one on a retrograde orbit ( e.g. ,  compare figs .  1 and 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate the timescale for the destruction of ngc  205 based on the dynamical friction timescale . using eqn .",
    "( 7.26 ) in @xcite , we assume the orbital velocity of ngc  205 is related the velocity difference between ngc  205 and m31 ( @xmath103 km  s@xmath2 ) and calculate @xmath104 years . detailed dynamical modeling is required to determine if features in the m31 halo , such as stellar substructure @xcite , or hi clouds @xcite are indeed associated with the orbit of ngc  205 .",
    "we present the stellar kinematics of ngc  205 out to large radii based on keck / deimos multislit spectroscopic observations of 725 individual red giant branch stars .",
    "ngc  205 is one of the closest examples of a dwarf elliptical galaxy and the prototype of this galaxy class .",
    "early kinematic observations of ngc  205 established the paradigm that de galaxies are supported primarily by anisotropic velocity dispersions @xcite . although kinematic study of des outside the local group suggest that a fraction of des are indeed supported by anisotropic velocity dispersion alone @xcite , ngc  205 itself has significant rotation .",
    "we measure a maximum major - axis rotation speed for the body of ngc  205 of @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 , implying that this galaxy is supported by a mixture of both rotational and anisotropic velocities .",
    "the velocity profile of ngc  205 turns over at a major - axis distance of @xmath98kpc ) .",
    "this turnover is due to gravitational interaction between ngc  205 and its parent galaxy m31 .",
    "the motion of stars beyond the tidal radius suggest that ngc  205 is on a prograde encounter with m31 .",
    "detailed dynamical modeling should clarify what , if any , substructure in the m31 halo is associated with disruption of ngc  205 and provide insight into the on - going interactions between these two galaxies .",
