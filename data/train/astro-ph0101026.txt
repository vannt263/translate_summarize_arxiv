    "classical novae ( or simply , novae ) are explosions caused by thermonuclear runaways on accreting white dwarfs ( see , e.g. , chapter 5 of @xcite for a review ) . in common with many other astrophysical explosions , a significant fraction of",
    "the energy goes into the kinetic energy of the ejecta : for an ejecta mass of 10@xmath4m@xmath5  and an ejecta velocity of 1,000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7 , one obtains @xmath010@xmath8 ergs as the ejecta kinetic energy ; these may be taken as typical values .",
    "of course , not all novae are identical ; `` fast '' novae are visually brighter at maximum , its visual light decays faster , and ejecta velocities are higher , than the `` slow '' novae .",
    "the fastness can be characterised by the time it takes the nova to decline by 2 ( t@xmath9 ) or 3 ( t@xmath10 ) visual magnitudes ; there is a well - known correlation between the peak absolute magnitude and the rate of decline , which makes novae useful as distance indicators .",
    "the white dwarf mass and other factors are known to influence the fastness of a nova , although full details are still being worked out .",
    "another important distinction can be discerned from the abundances of the nova ejecta : roughly a third of recent novae are neon novae , those believed to occur on o - ne - mg white dwarfs , while the remainder are believed to occur on c - o white dwarfs .",
    "the underlying binary is a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) , that is , a white dwarf accreting from a late type companion , usually a roche - lobe filling dwarf on or near the main sequence . under certain conditions ,",
    "the accreted material becomes degenerate ; a sufficient accumulation of this fresh fuel causes a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "a nova typically reaches its peak visual brightness within a few days after the onset of brightening . in the early decay phase",
    ", the intense wind from the still nuclear - burning white dwarf creates a huge pseudo - photosphere , completely obscuring the underlying binary .",
    "the declining mass - loss rate shrinks the photosphere , during which the bolometric luminosity remains roughly constant , at about the eddington limit , and the effective temperature increases .",
    "finally , when the photosphere has shrunk to the original radius of the white dwarf , the nova may become a super - soft source , exhibiting an intense , optically thick radiation from the white dwarf surface , with an effective temperature of the order 50 ev .",
    "such super - soft emission is observed 6 months to several years after the visual peak of the nova .",
    "recently , @xcite performed _ chandra _  grating observations of v382  vel  and v1494  aql and discovered line - rich x - ray spectra , superimposed on a super - soft continuum in the case of the latter but not the former . these cast some doubt on the reliability of the parameters derived from lower resolution x - ray observations ( such as with _ rosat _",
    "pspc ) , although the gross characterization of the super - soft component is probably secure in many cases .",
    "in addition , an early , hard x - ray component has been observed in several recent novae .",

    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    for these _ rxte _  spectra ,",
    "we have used a simple absorber model , since _ rxte _",
    "pca is not sensitive to the type of soft excess seen in the _ asca _  spectrum .",
    "the column densities deduced from the fits decrease to an almost undetectable ( to _ rxte _ ) level , accompanied by a decrease in the temperature of the bremsstrahlung model ; either change in itself is not sufficient to explain the observed spectral softening .",
    "the fe k line is securely detected above the bremsstrahlung continuum model in observations 2 & 3 . however , even then , the lines are weaker than the plasma models would suggest .",
    "these results are summarized in table 2 and in fig .",
    "cvs long after a nova eruption are often seen as x - ray sources with luminosities in the 10@xmath1810@xmath19 ergss@xmath7 range . however , it is unlikely that accretion can explain the x - rays we observed in v382  vel , given that the underlying binary was buried deep within the optically thick wind at the epochs of these observations , quite apart from the question of whether accretion could have been reestablished within several weeks of the onset of the nova eruption .",
    "three nova - specific mechanisms for hard x - ray emission have been proposed : radioactive decays , super - soft emission , and shock emission .",
    "radioactive decays of @xmath20na produces 1.275 mev @xmath21-ray line , which could produce x - rays via compton - degradation @xcite .",
    "however , resulting x - rays predominantly originate from a surface with compton optical depth @xmath01 , i.e. , n@xmath22  @xmath23 @xmath2 ; this is far in excess of even the highest column density seen in v382  vel , @xmath01.0@xmath24 @xmath2 measured with _ asca _ , hence we exclude radioactive decays from further considerations .",
    "the super - soft emission is the optically thick radiation from the white dwarf surface , with an effective temperature of the order 50 ev , thus clearly of the wrong shape to explain our observations .",
    "this component was , however , observed with _ bepposax _  in november , 1999 in v382  vel  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this leaves shock emission as the only viable candidate as the origin of x - rays from v382  vel  observed with _",
    "asca _  and _ rxte _  between day 20.5 and 59 .    in one version of the shock model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the nova ejecta interact with pre - existing , circumstellar material .",
    "there is a severe problem with such an external shock model : as @xcite point out , the presence of an unevolved secondary in most classical nova makes the likelihood of extensive pre - outburst circumstellar material low .",
    "the amount of interstellar medium that the nova ejecta can encounter during the first year is obviously too small , and there is no evidence for a dense circum - binary material in classical novae before an eruption .",
    "as previously mentioned , in a system with a red giant mass donor ( such as rs  oph ) , the external shock model works well ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . there is no indication to date that v382  vel  has a giant mass donor , however .",
    "we therefore discard the external shock explanation for the early x - ray emissions in classical ( non - recurrent ) novae .",
    "the _ asca _  and _ rxte _  observations reported here provide three valuable clues as to the nature of the putative shock : the n@xmath22  history , the kt history , and the behavior of the fe k line .    the observed n@xmath22  can not be interstellar , because it is variable .",
    "moreover , the uv observations @xcite indicate a reddening e@xmath25 of perhaps 0.2 , or n@xmath22  @xmath03@xmath26 @xmath2 .",
    "this is also consistent with the november , 1999 , _ bepposax _",
    "observation , from which an x - ray column of n@xmath22  = 2@xmath27 @xmath2 has been determined @xcite .",
    "a simple model consisting of a discrete shell of mass 5@xmath28 m@xmath5  expanding at 1000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7 , ejected at time 0 ( the presumed peak of the thermonuclear runaway ) , is successful in describing the time history of n@xmath22  as measured with _",
    "rxte _  if one assumes a point - like x - ray source at its center . for an extended source ,",
    "photons from near the limb has longer path lengths through the cold outer shell , thus the above shell mass is an overestimate , particularly for a limb - brightened x - ray source . the point - source model that fits the _ rxte _  observation overpredicts the _ asca _",
    "n@xmath22  by 50% .",
    "this may be due , in part , to the simplistic treatment of the complex geometry ; or the outer shell may have been partially ionized at early stages , allowing low energy photons to escape and hence complicating our spectral fits ( a similar mechanism may have allowed the very early detection of v838  her with _ rosat _",
    "extrapolation of this model back to day 5.7 , the epoch of the initial _ rxte _  observation , implies that the column would have been @xmath29 @xmath2 , too high to allow x - rays escape even allowing for some overprediction .",
    "that is , the n@xmath22  history is suggestive of an origin in an expanding shell , the ejecta from the 1999 nova eruption itself .",
    "the mass in this shell is probably somewhat less than 5@xmath28 m@xmath5  if , as seems likely , the x - ray emission is from a limb - brightened inner shell .",
    "this model of the n@xmath22  history leads naturally to an internal shock model .",
    "an expanding outer shell provides the observed n@xmath22 , with the x - ray producing shock residing inside . the simplest model , then , consists of two distinct shells of nova ejecta .",
    "the initial ejecta provide the absorbing column ; a layer of later , and faster - moving , ejecta plough into the initial ejecta",
    ". the high shock temperature of kt@xmath010 kev requires a strong shock with velocity differential of @xmath03000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7 .",
    "later observations show a softer spectrum , in kt as well as in n@xmath22 , which suggests that the two sets of ejecta are merging to form a single layer .",
    "this is a scenario first proposed by @xcite , which was motivated by the vast literature on the optical spectra of classical novae in eruption .",
    "quantitative models of optical spectra of classical novae are generally based on a single - component , optically thick wind approximation @xcite .",
    "however useful this formalism may be , it is clear from the rich taxonomy of optical spectra of novae ( summarized most notably by @xcite ) that nova ejecta are far more complex than this .",
    "several distinct systems are often recognized . in time order ,",
    "these are called pre - maximum , principal , diffuse enhanced , and orion components .",
    "as the name implies , the pre - maximum component is the first absorption features seen , before the visual light curve reaches its maximum ; their typical velocities are in the 1001000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7  range .",
    "this component therefore is associated with the initial ejecta from the nova eruption , which presumably carries the pseudo - photosphere with it as it expands .",
    "the principal system follows next , with a higher velocity and a higher ionization ; this is the system that persists decades after the eruptions and can be identified with the expansion velocity of the nova shells .",
    "diffuse enhanced and orion systems are yet of higher ionizations and higher velocities ( 1000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7  in slow nova to as high as 4000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7  in very fast novae ) .",
    "we see ever deeper into the optically thick wind as time goes by , due to the decrease in the mass loss rate , hence the optical depth at a given physical location .",
    "this does explain the increasing trend in ionization ; however , we should observe less accelerated material as time goes on in a one - zone wind model .",
    "the fact that the observed velocities increase with time probably requires at least two distinct components . for example",
    ", @xcite explains the principal component as due to the result of a collision between the slow - moving pre - maximum system with the faster - moving diffuse enhanced / orion system",
    ". applied to a fast nova , this model predicts a collision between pre - maximum component moving typically at 1000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7  and the fast wind with a typical velocity of 4000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7 , with the resulting shock of kt@xmath010 kev .",
    "this is just the x - ray temperature we observe in v382  vel .",
    "since we are unaware of any pre - maximum spectroscopy , we simply adopt the `` typical '' value of 1000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7 ; as for the fast wind , @xcite report a terminal velocity of 5000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7for al iii @xmath301860 and si iv @xmath301400 lines .",
    "thus the shock in v382  vel  may have been capable of producing an even higher x - ray temperature , but is consistent with the observed value .    in more theoretical terms ,",
    "the pre - maximum system can be associated with the dynamical ejection of the white dwarf envelop at near the peak of the thermonuclear runaway ; the faster materials can then be associated with radiation - driven wind due to the continued shell hydrogen burning , whose other manifestation is the super - soft x - ray emission from the hot photosphere to be observed several month later .",
    "assuming that the shock is due to the collision between the pre - maximum system and a fast - moving wind , what are the likely physical conditions ?",
    "first , the density of the pre - maximum ejecta can be estimated as follows .",
    "let us assume an ejecta mass of 2@xmath28 m@xmath5  ( as we have argued that the 5@xmath28 m@xmath5  figure from n@xmath22 history was likely a slight overestimate ) .",
    "the ejecta are expanding as a shell with radius @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the ejection velocity @xmath01000 kms@xmath7 and @xmath33 the time since explosion .",
    "there is likely to be a velocity dispersion @xmath34 ( say , 200 kms@xmath7 ) in the ejecta ; taking the increasing radial spread into account , the volume of the pre - maximum system at 20 days after eruption is @xmath35 @xmath36 and the density is estimated to be 7.5 @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "for the fast wind , since we assume this to be a continuous ( and slowly changing ) phenomenon , velocity dispersions would not affect the density .",
    "for a wind mass loss rate of 2@xmath39 gs@xmath7 ( or @xmath40 m@xmath5  in 100 days ) at a wind velocity of 4000 kms@xmath7 , the wind density at the pre - maximum shell would be 7.5@xmath41 @xmath38 .",
    "it appears likely that the fast wind will be initially assimilated into the pre - maximum shell , after undergoing a shock , with a post - shock density of the order 3@xmath37 @xmath38 .    if our interpretation is correct , the physical conditions of the early x - ray emission source in v382  vel  is orders of magnitudes denser than in supernova remnants , and orders of magnitudes more rarified than in accretion shocks in cvs , two well - studied classes of shock heated , x - ray emitting , plasmas .",
    "although it may be comparable to stellar coronae in density alone , the heating mechanism and the environment are different .",
    "applications of existing spectral models ( widely tested in supernova remnants and stellar coronae ) must therefore proceed with caution .",
    "such an internal shock model has already been suggested as a possibile explanation of the early _ rosat _  detection of v838  her @xcite .",
    "@xcite has developed this into a detailed numerical model assuming a constant mass loss rate , with ejection velocity of 1000 kms@xmath7 for the 1st day , increasing linearly to 3600 kms@xmath7 by day 5 , and remaining constant thereafter .",
    "our model and theirs are similar in that x - rays are generated from an internal shock .",
    "however , @xcite and we have chosen different sets of simplyfing assumptions .",
    "@xcite assume a constant mass loss rate , with a smoothly changing ejection velocity ; in contrast , we have assumed a two distinct phases of mass loss with a discontinuous change in velocity .",
    "are the differences significant , and if so , which is the better framework on which to build future , more detailed , models ?",
    "let us first examine how the specific predictions of the @xcite numelical model compare with our data on v382  vel : we find two significant differences .",
    "first difference concerns the predicted temperature of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "the @xcite model predicts 2@xmath42 to 2@xmath41k ( or kt@xmath00.22 kev ) x - ray emitting plasma , matching one of the two thermal plasma model parameters that fit the _ rosat _  pspc spectrum of v838  her ( model rs2 in table 2 of @xcite ) , whereas we observe kt@xmath010 kev on day 20.5 in v382  vel .",
    "secondly , @xcite claims that `` for these parameter values the consequent reduction in low - energy x - rays is small , '' whereas low - energy photons are decimated by intrinsic absorption in the _ asca _  spectrum of v382  vel .",
    "note that , while the @xcite model does predict a high temperature region ( t@xmath43k ) 10 days after eruption , the density predicted in this region is orders of magnitude too low to result in significant x - ray emission ( from their figure 1 , we estimate emission measure of order 10@xmath44@xmath38 , compared to @xmath45@xmath38 estimated from _ asca _  and _ rxte _  spectra ) . moreover , since this high temperature is seen at the outermost edge of the ejecta , little absorption is predicted ( to be precise , half the emission should have interstellar n@xmath22 , while the other half could suffer relatively high intrinsic absorption ) .",
    "thus , the specific numerical model presented in @xcite can not explain our data on v382  vel ; however , this is not surprising .",
    "we now ask the more reasonable question : what changes in model parameters might bring the predictions of the @xcite model into line with our observations of v382  vel ?",
    "the penultimate paragraph of  3.2 of @xcite makes it clear that their model parameters are reasonably constrained by observations .",
    "the mass loss rate is determined by the observed x - ray luminosity : given the similar x - ray luminosities inferred for v838  her and v382  vel , we can not siginificantly increase the mass loss rate adopted for the former by @xcite . without adjusting the mass loss rate , it does not appear possible to match the n@xmath22  we observe in v382  vel .",
    "the temperature of the x - ray emitting region in their model is determined by the velocity contrast , @xmath46 ; because the line velocities measured in v382  vel  is similar to those in v838  her ( @xcite reports a terminal velocity of 3000@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7  and @xcite assumed 3600@xmath6km@xmath6s@xmath7 ) , we can not arbitrarily increase the velocity contrast , hence are unable to match the high temperature ( kt@xmath010 kev ) in v382  vel .",
    "it appears that there is not much room to adjust the parameters , from their own analysis of their numerical model .",
    "given this , we conclude that we probably need to abandon some of the simplifying assumptions adopted by @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the simple arguments we presented in  4.1 may serve as a starting framework on which to construct detailed models , without the difficulties encountered by the @xcite version .",
    "finally , we note that any model that can succesfully explain v382  vel  may apply , with minor modifications , to v838  her .",
    "this is because the _ rosat _  pspc data on v838  her can be fitted with a thermal model with kt@xmath474 kev ( model rs1 in table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the weakness of the fe k line is consistent with the shock model , provided either that the fe abundance is low in the ejecta , or that the shocked plasma is not in ionization equilibrium .",
    "there is no theoretical objection to a low fe abundance in nova ejecta .",
    "this could arise either because the white dwarf accretes low fe abundance material from the secondary , or because the heavy elements have settled down to deeper layers of the primary in before the nova eruption .",
    "however , v382  vel  has been classified as a fe ii nova , because its optical spectra include strong and broad fe ii lines ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the x - ray continuum shape in the 510 kev region measured with _",
    "_  suggest the presence of an fe edge at a level consistent with a solar composition absorber with n@xmath48 @xmath2 ( nb this is not a secure result on its own , as the fe edge depth is linked with the fe emission line strength and the continuum shape in our fit ) .",
    "clearly , fe is present in the ejecta of v382  vel .",
    "therefore , we prefer to discount a low abundance as the explanation for the weak fe k features in the x - ray spectra .    instead",
    ", we consider it likely that the fe in the nova ejecta is underionized .",
    "studies of supernova remnants typically find that the ionization equilibrium is archived with a timescale @xmath49 such that @xmath50 @xmath38s ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in young supernova remnants with @xmath51 @xmath38s ,",
    "the iron atoms are in the process of being ionized and this can result in weaker fe k@xmath3 line at an energy somewhat lower than at equilibrium . we do not have a detailed model of how this might apply to v382  vel , and it may not be wise to apply the existing non - equilibrium models of supernova remnants without carefully considering the different conditions .    one observational constraint we have on the density is the emission measure , which can be derived from the normalization of the bremsstrahlung model : they are 1.7@xmath52 @xmath38 for the _ asca _  data and @xmath53 @xmath38 for the subsequent _ rxte _  spectra .",
    "if the emission region of volume @xmath54 has a uniform density @xmath55 , emission measure simply equals @xmath56 .",
    "we can calculate the minimum density consistent with the observed x - ray spectrum by taking the volume of the sphere within the 1000 kms@xmath7 pre - maximum ejecta front at day 20 ( @xmath57 @xmath36 ) , and assuming a filling factor of 1/4 ( since a strong shock compresses by a factor of 4 ) : it is @xmath58 @xmath38 ( for the assumed 2 kpc distance ) .",
    "such a plasma will stay in nonequilibrium for @xmath0half a day .",
    "this short timescale for reaching ionization equilibrium is a problem for this interpretation : perhaps the observed x - ray emissions are dominated by recently shocked materials . on the positive side",
    ", there is a hint that the detected lines were at lower energies than those predicted by the ionization - equilibrium plasma models ( table 2 and fig .",
    "4 ) , which is predicted by the non - equilibrium models . clearly",
    ", we need higher quality observations of future bright novae , as well as further modelling of nova ejecta , to discover for certain the cause of weak fe k@xmath3 lines in v382  vel .",
    "we have observed early x - ray emission from a bright classical nova , v382  vel .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was hard with kt@xmath010 kev and n@xmath22  = 1@xmath24 @xmath2 3 weeks after the onset of the eruption , declining to 2.5 kev and @xmath59 @xmath2 2 months after the peak in the optical .",
    "given an assumed distance of 2 kpc , v382  vel  maintained an x - ray luminosity of @xmath60 ergss@xmath7 for at least 20 , perhaps as long as 40 , days .",
    "the fluence in the x - ray component during this interval was about @xmath61 ergs , a small fraction of the estimated total kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "this evolving hard x - ray emission can be best modelled as due to an internal shock within the nova ejecta .",
    "such a shock was originally postulated by @xcite to explain the taxonomy of optical lines .",
    "we have argued that a detailed model developed by @xcite to explain the _ rosat _  pspc data on v838  her can not be adopted to explain our data on v382  vel ; we have outlined our own model , broadly of the same type but with different assumptions , that may serve as a starting point for future modelling works .",
    "sensitive x - ray observations of other bright novae are necessary to clarify the dependence of hard x - ray properties on the speed class .",
    "however , slower novae will almost certainly have a lower peak temperature and remain obscured for a longer period .",
    "frequent optical spectroscopy is also necessary to obtain the velocities of various ejecta components , to be compared with the x - ray temperature evolution .",
    "perhaps most importantly , the field of early x - ray emissions from classical novae is still in its infancy such that a single bright and well - observed system can significantly improve our level of knowledge , as we hope we have demonstrated in this paper . given the presence of x - ray observatories of unprecedented capabilities during the first decade of the 21st century , we can only hope to see a dramatic increase in our knowledge .",
