    "an attempt to realign the peaks would bring the agreement on arcminute scales into tension .",
    "the observed peak offsets between the gismo and xmm-_newton _",
    "maps is not expected to be due to pointing errors . xmm-_newton",
    "_  imaging is precise to the subarcsecond level , and the positions of bright x - ray point sources agree with the locations of bright wise counterparts .",
    "the gismo pointing model is checked against 466 measurements of bright point sources , observed hourly through several days .",
    "all are within an rms deviation @xmath41 .",
    "the gismo observations combine 32 observation blocks , each bracketed by independent pointings , thus the statistical 1-@xmath20 pointing error of the composite map is estimated at 0.8 .",
    "we also note that the positions of dozens of bright compact sources observed by gismo observations during the same observation period are reproduced within the expected accuracy .",
    "we therefore consider the discrepancy to be of astrophysical nature .",
    "we do not expect to detect any contamination by the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) .",
    "the unresolved part of the cib is removed by flux zeroing outside of the cluster , so our fluxes are effectively referenced against the mean cib level .",
    "resolved cib sources may be present in the map , but are unlikely to be detectable .",
    "a deep - field study with gismo by @xcite finds no sources brighter than @xmath41mjy ( @xmath193-@xmath20 in our map ) in a similar area to our field , and put the 2 mm confusion noise at @xmath4250@xmath43jy , i.e.  several times below the rms in the observations presented here .",
    "the combined cmb+cib at scales from 14  has also been measured at 150  ghz by the spt to be @xmath42100@xmath43k @xcite , corresponding to a signal @xmath42@xmath44jy / bm in the gismo data , comparable to the noise level in our map .",
    "we also note that recent studies by @xcite and @xcite both found the radio and submillimeter point source contribution to be minimal near 150  ghz .",
    "therefore , cib / cmb contamination in our map is expected to be small .",
    "sz and x - ray imaging are sensitive to the line of sight integrals of pressure ( eq .  [ eq : compy ] ) and density squared , respectively ; for bremsstrahlung emission , x - ray surface brightness has only a weak dependence on temperature , @xmath45 .",
    "differences between the sz and x - ray maps ( @xmath30 and ) can therefore be due to temperature substructure or to the differing line of sight distribution of the gas ( e.g. clumping or asphericity ) .",
    "the location of the sz signal at @xmath196-@xmath20 broadly agrees with the location of the hottest gas found in the temperature and pseudo - pressure maps ( figure [ fig : cluster_xray ] , middle and right , respectively ) , but we find no clear evidence for shock - heated gas at the resolution of the x - ray spectroscopy . for the high - significance ( @xmath196-@xmath20 ) sz region , we extracted spectra from both xmm-_newton _   observations , and x - ray counts within @xmath36 , using the same fitting procedure and plasma model as for deriving the temperature .",
    "we find only a marginal enhancement of @xmath46  kev over the global temperature @xmath47  kev , which agrees with that found by @xcite .",
    "this leaves the possibility that the sz / x - ray offset is due to an irregular gas distribution along the line of sight or the breakdown of the assumption that pseudo - pressure and sz features should directly match .",
    "the so - called ` slab approximation ' , which treats the line of sight temperature as isothermal in each spectroscopic bin and assumes the path length through the cluster is a constant ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may not hold for complicated merger geometries .",
    "we present the first high significance maps of the sz effect with gismo , revealing substructure in the _",

    "the core morphology mimics the appearance of the x - ray observation ( reported here and in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is notably offset from their x - ray counterparts .",
    "the presence of the giant radio halo reported in @xcite further supports the hypothesis that this system is likely a merger .",
    "this gismo observation demonstrates that a comparable level of detail in a moderately high-@xmath3 cluster can now be obtained from large , ground - based telescopes in a similar amount of time as that currently required for x - ray observations .",
    "this adds to a small but growing number of instruments that have imaged the sz effect at resolutions better than 20 , which include such instruments as nobeyama ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
