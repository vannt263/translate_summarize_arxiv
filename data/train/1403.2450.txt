    "the vast experimental progress in the generation of intense laser pulses and ultrarelativistic particle beams makes it essential to attain a profound understanding of the dynamics of charged particles in the presence of electromagnetic background fields .",
    "the investigation of the latter is not only interesting from a theoretical point of view but also crucial for experimental applications , e.g. , in accelerator and plasma physics .",
    "already in the realm of classical electrodynamics the problem occurs on how to calculate the trajectory of a charged particle in an external field , including the continuous loss of energy and momentum due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "this so - called radiation - reaction ( rr ) problem consists in determining an equation of motion of the charged particle , which self - consistently incorporates energy - momentum loss .",
    "historically , the lorentz - abraham - dirac ( lad ) equation has been suggested and it can be obtained by eliminating the degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic field in the coupled system of maxwell s and single - particle lorentz equations @xcite . the lad equation contains additional terms apart from the lorentz - force , which are responsible for rr effects .",
    "one of these terms , however , depends on the time - derivative of the charge acceleration , which in turn leads to the existence of so - called runaway solutions , with the particle acceleration exponentially increasing with time even in absence of any driving force @xcite . on the other hand , it has been first noticed in @xcite , that in the realm of classical electrodynamics , i.e. , if quantum effects , like the recoil in photon emission , are negligible , the lad equation can be consistently approximated via the so - called landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation , that avoids the above - mentioned inconsistencies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "even though the ll equation provides a consistent description of rr in classical electrodynamics , the experimental verification of this equation is still missing . in the so - called classical radiation dominated regime the electron emits an average energy in a single laser cycle , which is comparable to its initial energy and rr effects dominate the electron dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the classical radiation dominated regime is rather hard to be entered with present technology . in @xcite",
    "strong signatures of rr have been predicted to occur also below the classical radiation dominated regime , based on the analytical solution of the ll equation in an arbitrary plane - wave field found in @xcite .",
    "alternative proposals to measure rr effects in the classical domain have been suggested in @xcite .    since classical electrodynamics",
    "is contained in the underlying theory of quantum electrodynamics , the understanding of the quantum origin of rr is of fundamental importance .",
    "as we have mentioned , rr in classical electrodynamics include all effects , which go beyond the lorentz dynamics and which stem from the action of the electromagnetic field generated by the charged particle , an electron for definiteness , on the electron itself , when it is driven by a background electromagnetic field .",
    "analogously , rr in qed includes all possible processes that may arise starting from a single , external - field - driven electron @xcite .",
    "thus , the complete description of rr in the quantum regime can be achieved by the calculation of the full @xmath0-matrix , including effects like radiative corrections , multiple photon emission and pair creation following photon emission .",
    "this implies that in the full quantum regime , the problem of rr is intrinsically multiparticle .",
    "however , in the moderate quantum regime , in which quantum effects are not too large and electron - positron pair production is negligible ( see sec .",
    "[ kinapp ] for further details ) , the process that mainly gives rise to rr effects is the incoherent emission of multiple photons .",
    "( note , for example , that radiative corrections @xmath1 to the square @xmath2 of the electron mass are negligible as they are of the order @xmath3 of @xmath2 . indeed ,",
    "such radiative corrections roughly scale as @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 is the fine - structure constant , with @xmath6 being the electron charge . )",
    "this regime is then single - particle as in classical electrodynamics and it has been investigated in detail in @xcite in the case of a background plane wave . in @xcite",
    "the so - called quantum radiation dominated regime has also been introduced , where the electron emits on average more than one photon with substantial recoil already in one laser period . in the quantum radiation dominated regime",
    "the electron dynamics is dominated by both quantum and rr effects .",
    "however , a sufficient increase of the intensity of the background electromagnetic field and/or of the initial electron energy will let enter a new regime , where neglecting pair creation is no longer permissible . in the collision of a laser field and electrons , pair production may occur due to two different processes @xcite ( see also for a recent review on pair - production processes @xcite ) : ( i ) the photons emitted by the incoming electrons reach sufficiently high energies allowing for laser - assisted electron - positron production and ( ii ) the direct pair production by electrons via the emission of virtual photons .",
    "these two channels are treated in a unified way in strong - field qed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the presence of an electromagnetic wave of sufficient high intensity",
    ", the emission of the photon and the transformation of the photon into an electron - positron pair do not occur in the same formation region @xcite .",
    "since the created charged particles are thereupon accelerated by the laser field , the produced pairs will emit further photons and , under certain circumstances , prime the formation of the so - called qed cascades @xcite .    in the present paper we first study the interaction of an electron beam colliding head - on with a strong plane wave in the nonlinear moderate quantum regime and follow the macroscopic kinetic approach @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ kinapp ] ) , which allows to take into account the multiple incoherent emission of high - energy photons by a distribution of electrons in the quantum regime .",
    "alternative approaches are the microscopic approach employed in @xcite or the stochastic model of rr investigated in @xcite . since rr is , generally speaking , a dissipative effect ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a setup , which allows to use rr effects to control the electron dynamics ) , we focus our attention in sec .",
    "[ shape ] on the effects stemming from the pulse shape and duration of the laser field .",
    "as we will see , such effects can be exploited as an observable for testing the predictions of qed in the quantum radiation dominated regime .",
    "we will see that already at available laser intensities of the order of @xmath7 , the final electron distribution strongly depends on the shape and on the duration of the pulse also at a given pulse fluence , whereas the classical dynamics based upon the ll equation would predict no dependence in this case .",
    "further , the influence of the form and of the duration of the pulse shape at a given laser fluence on the photon spectrum emitted by the electron distribution is also investigated . in sec .",
    "[ pairprosec ] we extend the approach in @xcite and we will also take into account the possibility that emitted photons then transform into electron - positron pairs .",
    "therefore , we include the corresponding probabilities in our kinetic approach and study how the inclusion of the process of pair creation influences the evolution of the charged particle and of the photon distribution functions .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations for different pulse durations at a given laser fluence will be presented for two different initial electron energy distributions , allowing us to identify two distinguishable scenarios , where the laser pulse duration has diverse effects on the number of produced pairs . in the appendix",
    "a we amend a step in the derivation of the kinetic equation given in the supplemental material of @xcite ( eq .",

    "finally , appendix b contains an example showing numerically the equivalence of the kinetic approach proposed here and the previous microscopic approach developed in @xcite .",

    ", this approximation is valid if the relativistic parameter @xmath39 of the plane wave is much larger than unity .",
    "in fact , if @xmath40 is the central wavelength of the plane wave and thus the typical distance over which the plane wave varies , the radiation formation length @xmath41 of the photon production process at @xmath42 is @xmath43 and it is much smaller than @xmath44 @xcite .    in our approach , we describe the electron beam via an electron distribution @xmath45 .",
    "it is always assumed that the electron distribution depends only on @xmath26 and on @xmath46 , i.e. , the motion along the perpendicular directions @xmath47 and @xmath48 is neglected ( see also ref .",

    "electron - positron pairs are also produced in the collision of the electron beam and the laser field , because the electrons emit photons , which in turn can still interact with the laser field @xcite .",

    "[ pairchar]b ) only shows the final distribution functions for the full dynamics and the one where radiation by positrons is excluded .",
    "further , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pairchar]a ) and fig .",
    "[ pairchar]c ) that the inclusion of pair creation drastically changes the final electron distribution and photon spectrum .",
    "the high - energy part of the photon spectrum is significantly decreased , as in the pair creation process the photon is transformed into a pair of charged particles also corresponding , in turn , to an increase in the low - energy part of the final energy distribution of the electrons . whereas , the electron distribution at very high energies is not altered , because the produced particles are mostly created at smaller energies .",
    "moreover , the photon gain is enlarged for smaller photon energies , due to the additional emission of the increased number of charged particles .",
    "in fact , the inclusion of rr for positrons shifts the final energy distribution to lower energies ( see fig .  [ pairchar]b ) ) , i.e. , the created particles are able to interact with the laser background field after the pair production and in turn will emit photons . in accordance with the argument above , this results in an enlarged photon gain for lower photon energies .",
    "furthermore , the radiation emitted by the positrons barely affects the evolution of the electrons leading to a slightly higher energy spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ pairchar]a ) ) . in this case , the produced positrons had a sufficiently high energy to emit photons that were enabled to again create a small number of pairs during the remaining interaction time with the laser pulse .",
    "now , we want to examine the influences of the initial energy of the electrons and the laser peak intensities on the final electron and positron distributions and on the photon spectrum . as in sec .",
    "[ shape ] , we will again consider laser pulses at a given pulse fluence that can experimentally be modified via pulse shaping .",
    "therefore , we consider two initially gaussian electron distributions the first as before with @xmath168 and @xmath169 and the second with @xmath174 and @xmath175 , which are both normalized to unity .",
    "we consider these two electron distributions to collide with three different laser pulses that have the same fluence @xmath176 and a sin@xmath129-pulse form , i.e. , @xmath177 , but differ in the number of laser cycles @xmath178 and the laser peak intensities .",
    "thus , we have chosen laser peak intensities of @xmath167 for @xmath179 ( @xmath105 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) , @xmath180 for @xmath181 ( @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) and @xmath185 for @xmath186 ( @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 ) corresponding to pulse durations of @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .     and photon spectra ( part c ) ) as functions of @xmath121 for the shape functions @xmath172 ( solid , red line ) , @xmath193 ( dashed , green line ) and @xmath194 ( short dashed , blue line ) for the initial gaussian electron distribution with @xmath168 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ pairnbfin ] the final electron and positron distributions as well as the photon spectra are shown for the three collisions with the first electron distribution . in agreement with our previous results ,",
    "the photon yield is higher for the 20-cycle pulse than for both the five - cycle pulse and the one - cycle pulse .",
    "the reason again is the longer interaction time of the electrons with the laser field , although the laser peak intensity is smaller . since the initial energy of the electrons and the laser intensities are sufficiently high to produce many high - energetic photons during the interaction , also the number of pairs produced by the longer pulses exceed the number produced by the one - cycle pulse ( see fig .",
    "[ pairnbfin ] ) .",
    "in fact , the ratio of the final and the initial electron number is reduced to @xmath195 for the one - cycle pulse , even though in comparison with the 20-cycle pulse the laser peak intensity is larger by a factor of @xmath196 . in prospect of an experimental investigation , an electron bunch with typical charge @xmath197 pc corresponding to a total initial number of @xmath198 electrons is considered in order to achieve estimates for the final number of produced positrons @xmath199 and photons @xmath152 . from our numerical simulations , we conclude that for the shape function @xmath172 it is @xmath200 and @xmath201 , whereas for @xmath193 it results @xmath202 and @xmath203 and for @xmath193 we obtain @xmath204 and @xmath205 .     and photon spectra ( part c ) ) as functions of @xmath121 for the shape functions @xmath172 ( solid , red line ) , @xmath193 ( dashed , green line ) and @xmath194 ( short dashed , blue line ) for the initial gaussian electron distribution with @xmath174 . ]",
    "since for the second electron distribution centered at @xmath206 the value @xmath75 is reduced by a factor of @xmath207 , also the value @xmath208 will be decreased and quantum effects and pair production are expected to be less prominent . the final distribution functions for the collision of this electron distribution and the aforementioned three laser pulses are shown in fig .",
    "[ pairnfin ] . as in the simulations above the electrons lose most of their energy in the collision with the 20-cycle pulse . on the other hand",
    ", the shorter pulses lead to much broader final electron distributions and the initial peak around @xmath174 is still pronounced for the one - cycle pulse .",
    "although this results once more in a much larger photon yield for the long pulse , the spectrum has it maximum at smaller values of @xmath70 than in the previous example ( see fig .  [ pairnfin]c ) ) .",
    "thus , the typical value @xmath208 is decreased significantly leading to a lower pair - production probability .",
    "in fact , the number of produced pairs by the shorter pulses now exceeds the one produced by the 20-cycle pulse . even though the total gain of photons is larger in the case of the long pulse , the energy of the emitted photons and the laser peak intensity are not sufficiently high to create a large number of pairs .",
    "however , for the five - cycle pulse the number of produced particles is slightly higher than for the shortest pulse , i.e. , the laser peak intensity is high enough in this case to obtain the beneficial effects of the longer interaction time also in the positron yield ( see fig .",
    "[ pairnfin]b ) ) . as in the previous examples , estimations for the final @xmath199 and @xmath152",
    "are given for an electron bunch with total initial number of @xmath198 electrons .",
    "hence , in the case of @xmath172 one obtains @xmath209 and @xmath210 , whereas in the case of @xmath193 ( @xmath211 ) it results @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( @xmath214 and @xmath215 ) .",
    "finally , we give an estimation for the laser peak intensities at which electron - positron pairs will be detectable for nowadays available laser accelerated electron beams @xcite . therefore",
    ", a gaussian electron beam centered at @xmath216 and @xmath217 with again a total number of @xmath198 electrons is considered to collide with 10-cycle sin@xmath129-shaped laser pulses with different peak intensities .",
    "considering that the detection of a few tens of positrons is feasible , pair production should be measurable at an intensity of @xmath218 , which would lead to a total number of @xmath219 created positrons .",
    "for a slightly lower electron energy @xmath220 the production of @xmath221 pairs already requires an increased intensity of @xmath222 , indicating that an increase in the beam energy is more favorable in the studies of pair production .",
    "in the present paper we have investigated how the pulse shape of the laser and its duration influence the evolution of an electron beam which collides head - on with the laser pulse . by employing a kinetic approach ,",
    "we have included quantum radiation - reaction effects , in a regime where they mainly stem from multiple incoherent photon emission . in particular , we have investigated the dependence of the final electron distribution and of the final photon spectrum on the pulse shape and on the duration of pulses with the same fluence . by keeping the laser fluence fixed ,",
    "we ensure that the classical theory of radiation reaction based on the landau - lifshitz equation predicts that the final electron spectrum and the total electromagnetic energy emitted by the electrons are the same for different pulses .",
    "thus , possible differences in such observables indicate an interplay of quantum and radiation - reaction effects .",
    "our numerical simulations show that already for @xmath223 the final electron distribution and final photon spectrum are altered by quantum radiation reaction effects .",
    "our results also indicate that these quantum radiation - reaction effects are measurable in principle already at available laser intensities of the order of @xmath7 @xcite and at electron bunch energies of the order of @xmath224 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have studied how electron - positron pair creation affects the dynamics of the charged particles and photons .",
    "the inclusion of electron - positron pair production was shown to significantly decrease the high - energy part of the photon spectra and to increase the low - energy part of the electron and positron distribution , due to the enhanced number of charged particles . moreover , a weak nonlinear coupling of all three distribution functions became apparent in the fact that the radiation of positrons can ( slightly ) alter the final electron distribution .",
    "since at a fixed laser fluence the photon gain was found to be higher for longer pulses ( though with smaller peak intensity ) , the creation process is amplified if the initial energy of the electrons is sufficiently high .",
    "finally , we estimated that nowadays high intensity laser facilities @xcite , as well as high energy electron beams @xcite , allow in principle for an experimental detection of pair creation in an all - optical setup .",
    "in this appendix we revise a step in the derivation of the kinetic equation ( [ kinetic1 ] ) of the main text given in the supplemental material of @xcite .",
    "we point out , however , that the final form of this equation is unchanged .    in the supplemental material of @xcite ,",
    "the electron distribution function @xmath225 has been assumed to have the structure @xmath226 corresponding to a distribution that is `` infinitely '' peaked at @xmath227 throughout the whole interaction of the electron beam with the laser plane - wave field . here",
    ", we used the light - cone coordinates @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 , and the corresponding quantities @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "however , the specific choice of the delta function is not essential for the derivation of the kinetic equation .",
    "we remind that a basic assumption in our approach is that @xmath234 , which allows us already to neglect the terms proportional to the transverse momenta and to @xmath235 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) in the supplemental material of @xcite .",
    "thus , by considering still a well peaked function , e.g. , a gaussian , but also allowing for a finite transverse momentum evolving in phase , we can seek for a solution of the form @xmath236 .",
    "since @xmath237 can be factorized by @xmath238 , we employ the modified ansatz in the approximated kinetic equation mentioned in the supplemental material of @xcite and obtain the following equation ( which replaces eq .",

    "p(\\phi;p_-\\to p_--k_-)}{d\\phi d k_-}\\right]\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we recall that in deriving this equation , we have also assumed that the emission of photons does not significantly broaden the electron distribution in the transverse momenta with respect to the broadening already induced by the laser field ( i.e. by the lorentz force ) . within our model , this assumption is justified as in the ultra - relativistic regime the electrons mainly emit along the instantaneous propagation direction @xcite , i.e. almost along the negative @xmath240 direction in the present case ( see also the supplemental material of @xcite ) .",
    "for the sake of consistency , in our simplified model , we have neglected the small angular spreading ( of the order of @xmath241 ) brought about by the lorentz force as well as by the emission of photons off - axis .",
    "now , the function @xmath242 can be chosen to satisfy the liouville - like equation @xmath243g_{e^-}(\\phi,\\bm{p}_\\perp)=0.\\ ] ] if @xmath244 is a given function @xmath245 well peaked around @xmath246 ( in the limiting case , it could also be @xmath247 ) ) , then the solution of eq .",
    "( [ p_perp ] ) is @xmath248 , where @xmath249 ( see also eq .   in the main text ) .",
    "thus , the evolution of the transverse electron momentum driven by the external plane - wave field decouples from the longitudinal one and we again obtain that the reduced distribution function @xmath250 satisfies eq .",

    "in this appendix the results of the so - called microscopic approach developed in @xcite are compared with the `` macroscopic '' kinetic approach employed here . in the microscopic approach the starting point to calculate",
    "the photon spectrum is the probability that a single electron emits more than one photon incoherently .",
    "the single - photon spectrum is then obtained by essentially integrating over the degrees of freedom of all emitted photons except one . in the microscopic approach",
    "one avoids the solution of the kinetic integro - differential equations ( [ kinetic1])-([kinetic2 ] ) .",
    "however , the calculation of multi - dimensional integrals is required , with dimensionality increasing with the number of photons emitted . in the numerical example considered in @xcite",
    "the spectrum was found to converge after the inclusion of @xmath251 photons and the corresponding multidimensional integrals were evaluated via the monte carlo method . for the sake of comparison with that numerical example , we consider a two - cycle sinusoidal pulse , i.e. , @xmath252 , with a peak intensity of @xmath253 and again with @xmath61 ( note that in @xcite the given value of the intensity was the average one ) .",
    "we center the initial gaussian electron distribution around @xmath58 ( corresponding to the value @xmath254 employed in @xcite ) , and consider a standard deviation of @xmath255 . in order to compare with the single - particle approach in @xcite and with the numerical results presented in fig . 2 there",
