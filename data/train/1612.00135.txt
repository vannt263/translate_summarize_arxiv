    "self - propelled particles ( spps ) are attracting more and more interest as a representative example of out - of - equilibrium systems@xcite .",
    "examples of spps range from the microscopic scale , with algae and bacteria , to the macroscopic scale , which includes all animals , and recently , even artificial spps have been constructed , such as active janus particles@xcite . among them , microswimmers are of particular interest , since they are suited to well - controlled lab experiments@xcite , and have many potential applications , for example , as targeted drug delivery systems .",
    "it is known that nontrivial motion , like the collective alignment of the swimming direction or the dynamic clustering can be observed , even for systems where particles interact with each other only through hydrodynamic interactions and excluded volume effects@xcite .",
    "such collective motion is mainly due to the complicated hydrodynamic interactions , and can not be predicted only from knowledge of the single particle dynamics . that these hydrodynamic interactions are strongly affected by the presence of confining walls is well known .",
    "experimentally , das _",
    "_ reported that when a single janus particle swims in the vicinity of a wall , it tends to swim along the wall@xcite .",
    "_ investigated the collective dynamics of a bacterial dispersion inside a circular confinement , and reported that the system spontaneously shows an anomalous double - vortex motion , the outermost agents swimming along the wall@xcite .",
    "while most numerical studies have focused on the dynamics in bulk , several works have reported on the dynamics of microswimmers near walls or under confinement@xcite . in the case of single - particle dynamics under confinement ,",
    "most works consider flat parallel walls or cylindrical pipes@xcite . as to the dynamics of many particle systems , they are usually studied under confinement of flat parallel walls . in particular , li and ardekani",
    "have investigated the static structure and shown evidence for the accumulation of particles near the wall@xcite .",
    "zttl and stark have studied a similar system@xcite , but under extreme confinement , and observed a dense - dilute phase separation , which is not seen in bulk .",
    "our previous work@xcite has focused on the dynamic properties of a microswimmer dispersion confined between flat parallel walls with relatively large separations ( compared to the size of the particles ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we observed a traveling wave - like collective motion for a specific range of swimming parameters and densities .",
    "though such a motion would seem to be a consequence of confinement , we clarified that it can be understood as the manifestation of the pseudo - acoustic properties of the system , which is already observed in bulk .",
    "as shown here , even for the same confinement geometry , the dynamic behavior can be considerably different depending on the strength of the confinement ( i.e. , the wall separation ) .",
    "therefore , how the dynamics changes under confinement is a very difficult question to answer .",
    "although we can find several works on the collective dynamics in bulk or between flat parallel walls , the many particle dynamics of swimmers in pipes has not been extensively studied so far .",
    "this is the focus of the present work .",
    "intuitively , we can expect that for big enough pipes , the dynamics will be the same as for bulk systems .",
    "therefore , we focus on the dynamics in pipes with diameters comparable to that of the particle , where we can expect nontrivial behaviors .",
    "in fact , in the work by zhu _",
    "_ , which deals with the single particle dynamics in a pipe with diameter three times the particle diameter , it is reported that different dynamical modes can be observed depending on the swimming type and strength@xcite .",
    "taking into account the possibility that the size and the shape of the pipe affect the dynamic properties , in this work , we investigated the collective alignment effects , known as the polar order formation , varying the four main parameters , namely , the pipe size , the pipe shape , the volume fraction and the type of the swimmers . regarding the polar order formation in many particle systems ,",
    "the behavior in pipes is mostly the same as in bulk .",
    "however , for a specified region of the parameter space , we observed clear wall effects , which we investigated by measuring the structural information of the dispersion .",
    "in addition , we observed the pipe size dependent order / disorder phase transition only for the parameters at which clustering behaviors have been reported in bulk and between flat walls@xcite . in this work",
    ", we also measured the bulk structural information and obtained indirect evidences which states that the clustering is important for the collective alignment for a specific range of parameters .",
    "as the numerical model for microswimmers , we employed the squirmer model@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the microswimmers are expressed by rigid particles with a prescribed flow field on their surface .",
    "the general squirmer model is expressed in the form of an infinite expansion , with components in the tangential , radial , and azimuthal directions . however , utilizing only the first two modes of the tangential field , following eq .",
    "( [ eq : sq_2 ] ) , already enables us to model different types of swimmers , namely pushers , pullers and the neutral swimmers .",
    "@xmath0 where , @xmath1 denotes the surface flow field , @xmath2 is a unit vector directed from the center of the particle to a point on its surface , @xmath3 the polar angle between @xmath2 and the swimming direction @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the tangential unit vector at @xmath2 .",
    "this simplified squirmer model has been widely used and is known to lead to a wide variety of nontrivial phenomena@xcite .",
    "the coefficient of the first mode , @xmath6 , determines the swimming velocity of an isolated squirmer ( @xmath7 ) , and that of the second mode , @xmath8 , determines the stresslet@xcite .",
    "the ratio between the coefficients of the two modes , @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sq_2 ] ) , determines the swimming type and strength .",
    "negative values of @xmath10 represents pusher - type swimmers , which swim with an extensile flow field in the swimming direction , and positive values describe puller - type swimmers , which swim with a contractile flow . a value of @xmath11 stands for a neutral swimmer , which generates a potential flow field .",
    "in this model , the prescribed flow field is assumed to be an axisymmetric pure tangential one and the particle is rigid and spherical .",
    "these are the only assumptions employed to derive the model .",
    "therefore , it is thought that this model can capture the features of the artificial microswimmers like janus particles even though it was originally intended to describe ciliary propulsion of micro - organisms .      in this work",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of particles swimming in a viscous fluid . for this",
    ", we must solve the combined fluid - solid problem . in order to do this efficiently , we employed the smoothed profile method ( spm ) . in the spm",
    ", we do nt treat the sharp boundary between the solid and fluid phases explicitly . instead",
    ", a diffuse interface with thickness of @xmath12 is introduced , and the phase boundaries are expressed by using a continuous order parameter @xmath13 , which takes the value of one in the solid domain , zero in the fluid domain , and intermediate values within the diffuse interface region . employing this methods , all the physical quantities can be expressed in terms of continuous fields defined over the whole computational domain .",

    "we note that the surface of the confinement has a non - zero roughness because the walls are represented by a collection of discrete particles .      using the calculation method presented above",
    ", we conducted three dimensional direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of microswimmer dispersions confined in pipes .",
    "the diameter @xmath14 and interface thickness @xmath12 of particles are set to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , where @xmath17 stands for the grid spacing . the excluded volume effect between particles ( both wall - particle and particle - particle )",

    "the dynamical mode at the steady state depends only on the sign of @xmath10 and is independent of the absolute value : a pusher gets trapped in an orbit and shows constant rotation at a fixed @xmath21 position , while a puller shows rectilinear translation along the pipe axis at a constant distance from the wall .",
    "a neutral swimmer achieves the combined dynamics of the two modes : spiral motion along the pipe axis ( rotation + translation ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the results in ref.@xcite ; although the trajectories of the pushers are not analyzed in detail in this work .",
    "as shown here , the single - particle dynamics are affected by the confinement .",
    "the intriguing thing is that the dynamical mode is determined only by the sign of @xmath10 , independent of the absolute value .",
    "regarding the bulk collective properties , it is known that such an absolute value dependence exists .",
    "for example , the polar order @xmath34 ( eq .  ( [ eq : bulk_q ] ) ) , used to measure the collective alignment , strongly depends on the absolute value of @xmath10 .",

    "we next performed calculations for many particle systems in a pipe of diameter @xmath24 .",
    "it is already known that the polar order @xmath34 is a function of both the swimming parameter @xmath10 , and the volume fraction of the particles @xmath38 .",
    "first of all , let us recapitulate the behaviors in bulk systems@xcite . if we measure the polar order as a function of @xmath10 at a certain value of the volume fraction , the value of @xmath34 decreases with the increase in the absolute value of @xmath10 , as stated above .",
    "this tendency is asymmetry with respect to positive and negative @xmath10 values , with negative values ( pushers ) , showing a faster decay . if we regard @xmath34 as a function of @xmath38 for a certain value of @xmath10 , the behavior is most easily understood in terms of the deviations from the volume fraction dependence for neutral swimmers .",
    "this reference system ( @xmath11 ) shows two regimes : for @xmath39 , the values are constant ; for @xmath40 there is an abrupt drop in the order parameter to @xmath41 . a similar behavior is observed for pushers ( negative values of @xmath10 ) . at small volume fractions , they show only a weak decrease with increasing volume fraction , and then exhibit an abrupt drop at a critical volume fraction @xmath42 .",
    "pushers show a decrease both in the degree of ordering and the value of @xmath42 .",
    "pullers , on the other hand , show a decrease only in the degree of ordering , and systems with @xmath43 even maintain the order at very high volume fractions , where all other systems show @xmath41 . specifically , we stress that in bulk , the system with @xmath32 shows a nonzero value of @xmath34 up to very high volume fractions",
    ".    we conducted simulations over a wide range of combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath13 in the pipe . from the particle trajectories obtained from these simulations",

    "[ fig : order_pipe_big ] , detailed results showing the volume fraction dependency are shown for four different values of @xmath10 , which exhibit qualitatively different behavior , @xmath58 . for the volume fraction ,",

    "as before , the bulk results are shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : order_pipe_big ] .",
    "although the results in the pipe are qualitatively the same as those in bulk for some of the cases , several differences can be perceived . in the case with @xmath11 , the value of @xmath34 at the smallest volume fraction , @xmath61 shows an obvious reduction in the pipe compared to the bulk . at other volume fractions ,",
    "the values match reasonably well .",
    "in the case of @xmath62 , we observe a similar reduction at the lowest volume fraction .",
    "in addition , in this case , we observe a rise in @xmath57 at intermediate volume fraction ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "finally , in the case with @xmath32 , we see no polar order ( @xmath64 ) at any of the volume fractions considered .    in order to understand these differences from the view point of the structures inside the pipe , we measured the following two functions , the local density @xmath65 and the local polar order along the @xmath21-axis @xmath66 .",
    "these are defined as a function of the perpendicular distance @xmath67 from the symmetry axis of the pipe : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of particles at a distance @xmath70 from the pipe axis , @xmath71 the average number density of the whole system , @xmath72 the width of the cylindrical bins , and the summation in eq .",

    "[ fig : order_pipe_big ] . from this figure",
    ", we can explain the differences seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : order_pipe_big ] . in the case of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ,",
    "when the volume fraction is small ( @xmath76 , ( a ) ) , particles show a strong tendency to accumulate in the vicinity of the wall and almost no particles are observed within the central region ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "such a wall accumulation effect has been reported for active systems in general@xcite , and several works on squirmers have also shown this behavior@xcite . at the same time , we can see that the local polar order is reduced in the vicinity of the wall .",
    "in other words , the pipe can be divided into two distinct regions from the view point of @xmath78 : an inner region where the local order has a value similar to that of the corresponding bulk dispersion , and an outer region ( near to the walls ) where the order is reduced . in the following ,",
    "we specify the characteristic size of this outer region by @xmath79 , the distance from the wall to the point where the inner region starts .",
    "because most particles accumulate in this outer region , where the order is reduced , the overall polar order is smaller than that in bulk .",
    "then , as @xmath38 is increased , the particles will become more uniformly distributed , and @xmath80 is reduced . at the same time , due to the wall accumulation effect , the effective volume fraction in the center region is smaller than the global volume fraction . taking into account the fact that the polar order increases with decreasing volume fraction ,",
    "this reduction in the volume fraction leads to a higher local polar order at the center , compared to the bulk value at the same global volume fraction .",
    "as a result of these two effects , namely , the decrease in @xmath80 and the increase of the local order due to the diluteness at the center , at @xmath81 , the value of @xmath47 recovers the bulk result . in the case of @xmath62 , at @xmath82 , the value of @xmath47 is even larger than that in bulk . in the case of @xmath11 , such an overshoot",
    "is not observed .",
    "this is because for @xmath11 , the volume fraction dependency of",
    "the polar order is so small that the order is determined only by the value of @xmath83 . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the value of @xmath83 becomes very large and we do nt see any ordering throughout the pipe , although the system with @xmath32 does show a nonzero value for polar order parameter @xmath34 in bulk . in the limit when the diameter of the pipe goes to infinity , we expect the dynamics should converge to that observed in bulk",
    ". therefore , we should see a qualitative transition at a critical diameter .",
    "this will be investigated in more in detail in sec .",
    "c .. we also note that the behavior of @xmath84 for @xmath32 is very similar to that of @xmath85 at all volume fractions , although the order formation tendencies are completely different . at the highest volume fraction @xmath86 , because of the screening of the hydrodynamic interactions , the excluded volume effects become dominant in determining the structure .",
    "consequently , the structure is the same for all values of @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that only in the case of @xmath85 , do we observe a nonzero value of @xmath47 .",
    "we have clarified that in many particle systems , the wall effects can be characterized by the accumulation of particles over a distance of @xmath80 close to the walls .",
    "these can lead to both enhancement and inhibition of the ordering , depending on the degree of accumulation and the size of @xmath80 .",
    "while for some cases we do observe a rectification effect due to the existence of walls , the origin for such effects seems to have nothing to do with the causes responsible for the single particle trajectories presented above .      here , we show results for the pipe diameter dependence on the many - particle dynamics .",
    "first , we present the results for the single - particle systems in a pipe with a `` small '' diameter . here , we use @xmath87 , which corresponds to the system in ref.@xcite . for these single - particle systems",
    ", we have observed the same qualitative results as those for @xmath24 ( which we refer to as the `` big '' pipe ) , except for pushers .",
    "first , let us recapitulate the single particle motion in the big pipe . in this case",
    ", the three different swimmers ( puller , pusher and neutral swimmer ) show qualitatively different trajectories .",
    "a puller swims parallel to the pipe axis , while a pusher is trapped in a closed orbit at a constant @xmath21-value .",
    "finally , a neutral swimmer shows a behavior in between that of a pusher and a puller , namely a spiral motion . in the small pipe",
    ", only a pusher shows a different dynamical mode from that observed in the big pipe . in the small pipe , a pusher follows a spiral trajectory , just like a neutral swimmer .",

    "the calculated results for @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath126 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gen_dis ] , for @xmath127 and @xmath58 , corresponding to the confined systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis_pipe ] .",
    "in addition , results for @xmath118 for passive colloidal systems are shown to aid in comparison .",
    "for these passive systems , the temperature is set so that @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the energy unit in our system , @xmath130 the fluid mass density and @xmath131 the viscosity .",
    "the exact value of the temperature does not affect the radial distribution function , provided that it is small enough .        to begin the analysis of the structure , we discuss the behavior of @xmath132 for the reference system of passive colloids . at the smallest volume fraction  ( @xmath76 )",
    ", it shows only a small first peak around @xmath133 , and quickly decays , converging to one around @xmath134 .",
    "the intensity of this first peak becomes larger as the volume fraction increases . at a volume fraction of @xmath135",
    ", we observe a shallow undershoot after the first peak .",
    "the correlation length becomes longer and the value converges to one at around @xmath136 . at @xmath82 ,",
    "it starts to show a second peak at a position @xmath137 , though the intensity is very small .",
    "finally , at @xmath86 , the system is in a mixed state of ordered and disordered phases@xcite , and shows four clearly distinguishable peaks .",
    "now , we would like to present the results for the active systems . in the case of @xmath11 , for all the volume fractions but the highest one ,",
    "the first peak is smaller or shifted to larger distances compared to the passive system .",
    "in addition , the first peak does nt even appear at the lowest volume fraction , @xmath76 .",
    "these behaviors may indicates that there is an effective repulsive interaction between particles caused by the flow field . due to this repelling flow field ,",
    "neutral swimmers tend to get distributed uniformly .",
    "similar effects can be seen in the pipe , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis_pipe ] where neutrals swimmers show a much more uniform distribution compared to the pushers .",
    "the correlations beyond the first peak follow closely those of the passive system , while other swimmers show longer ranged correlations .",
    "this tendency may reflect the fact that the flow field around a neutral swimmer ( decaying as @xmath138 ) is more localized , because of the lack of the force dipole term ( decaying as @xmath139 ) .",
    "regarding @xmath140 , the qualitative behavior follows that of @xmath132 .",
    "we note that the neutral swimmers exhibit a unique behavior around @xmath136 , where @xmath141 shows negative values for intermediate values of @xmath142 .    in the case of @xmath62 and @xmath143 ,",
    "the results are quite similar for all the volume fractions , although the peak heights show slight differences . in these cases ,",
    "the particles seem to show attractive tendencies due to the flow field , resulting in higher peaks for @xmath118 . as before",
    ", @xmath140 follows the qualitative behavior seen in @xmath118 . besides the higher peaks ,",
    "the correlation length is longer than that seen for neutral swimmers .",
    "however , the bulk values are reached by @xmath144 in all cases .    in the case with @xmath85 , or intermediate pullers , many unique behaviors can be observed .",
    "first of all , for intermediate pullers @xmath132 shows much more outstanding peaks than in any of the other cases . at @xmath135 ,",
    "only intermediate pullers show a definite second peak , and at @xmath82 , the second peak is much higher than in the other systems , and a third peak even appears .",
    "a similar peak behavior can be observed also in the plot of @xmath145 .",
    "in addition , we see a very long tail , which is not seen in the other cases .",
    "all these unique behaviors for intermediate pullers can be understood as indirect evidence for their already known dynamic clustering tendency@xcite .",
    "the high peaks reflect the clustering behavior , and the long tail in @xmath119 shows the strongly localized ordering .",
    "the nonzero order at high volume fractions helps explain how intermediate pullers can swim collectively , even under such extreme conditions .",
    "we note that the critical diameter of the pipe @xmath110 is bigger than any of the peaks detected here .    at the highest volume fraction , @xmath86 , the shapes of @xmath118 are the same for all @xmath10 , while only the passive system shows a different shape .",
    "regarding the neutral swimmer systems , @xmath11 , this is surprising because this system shows quite similar shapes at all the other volume fractions .",
    "the shape difference of @xmath132 between the passive and active systems at @xmath86 may be due to the phase transition of the passive system .",
    "for passive hard - spheres , the volume fraction in the range @xmath146 is known as the transient state of the ordered state and the disordered state@xcite . in the passive system at @xmath86 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gen_dis ] , such an ordered state seems to appear , while the active systems are still completely in the fluid phase . at this volume fraction , because the excluded volume effect is the dominant factor to determine the structure , rather than the flow field , all the active systems show the same shape for @xmath147 . in summary , although we could not obtain a direct connection between the bulk structural information and the in - pipe order / disorder phase transition , we believe our results for the structure present indirect evidence for the importance of the dynamic clustering on the stabilization of the polar order for intermediate pullers systems . in order to verify the exact connection between these two quantities",
    ", we have to conduct a more detailed analysis on the dynamic clustering in bulk .",
    "our previous results @xcite support this view on the importance of dynamic clustering . in this work , we investigated whether or not the polar order seen in bulk can be explained only by the repetition of binary collisions .",
    "we found that this is the case , except for systems of intermediate pullers , which means that many particle interactions might be important in this case .    finally , we have also considered pipes with diameters larger than @xmath54 . as the pipe size increases",
    ", we can expect that the dynamics approaches that of seen in bulk systems .",
    "indeed , for systems with @xmath148 , we see in fig .  [ fig : order_pipe_big ] that the order parameters in confinement agree very well with the bulk values .",
    "thus , for these values of @xmath10 , @xmath24 seem to be big enough . therefore , we have only considered larger diameters for @xmath32 , to investigate whether a finite value of @xmath34 is recovered for a large enough pipe diameter .",
    "we considered diameters up to @xmath149 but were not able to recover the bulk values in this case .",
    "thus , the hypothesis stated in section iii .",
    "b. is still not solved within the range of parameters considered in the present study .",
    "although it is possible that the dynamics can change for even larger diameters , we will not discuss this problem any more , as it lies outside the scope of the present work .",
    "the dynamics of fluids in pipes is known to depend on the shape of the cross section .",
    "therefore , we have also investigated the effect of the shape dependency on the dynamics of the swimmers .",
    "so far , most previous investigations have concerned dynamics in cylindrical pipes , with circular cross sections . here , we consider pipes with a rectangular cross section .",
    "we refer to such confinement geometries as `` ducts '' .",
    "we considered two sizes of ducts , specified by a lateral size of @xmath150 and @xmath54 , respectively . regarding the single - particle dynamics , the trajectories are qualitatively different from those in pipes for the case of pushers and neutral swimmers .",
    "pullers will swim parallel to the duct axis , as they do in pipes . in ducts ,",
    "regardless of the size , the trajectories of the pushers are spiral .",
    "of course , reflecting the duct shape , the projections onto the @xmath88-plane are no longer circular ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pro_tra_duct ] ) .",
    "the neutral swimmer shows a similar spiral trajectory , but it has a strong dependency on the initial state and sometimes the trajectories can become more complicated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pro_tra_duct ] ) . considering all the results for the single - particle system of pushers",
    ", we can conclude that the emergence of the circular closed orbits depends strongly on the curvature of the confining walls .",
    "therefore , if we increase the diameter of the pipe continuously from @xmath54 , at some point we will find a critical value for pushers to lose their orbit - type characteristics .",
    "such a detailed study is beyond our scope .",
    "the projection of the trajectories of a swimmer in duct onto the @xmath88-plane .",
    "( a ) pusher with @xmath32 .",
    "( b ) neutral swimmer .",
    "the lines represent the projections of the trajectories , with color intensity used to represent the time . ]    with regards to the many particle dynamics , we do nt see any big differences from those in pipes .",
    "namely , the results are almost the same as those in bulk when the duct size is big enough , and the ordering seen for intermediate pullers collapses when the size is decreased . as a result , intriguingly , from the view point of the polar order of the many particle dispersion , the results are qualitatively the same between pipes and ducts",
    ". however , it is possible that we one can observe unique dynamics in a skewed confinement .",
    "we investigated the polar order formation in pipes , conducting three - dimensional direct numerical simulation with fully resolved hydrodynamics . as a result of the investigation over a broad range of parameters",
    ", we confirmed that in most cases the dynamics of many particle systems in pipes match very well those in bulk .",
    "we have only observed considerable differences over a small range of parameters .",
    "we have presented an explanation for the emergence of wall effects by measuring the structural information .",
    "they are mostly due to the wall accumulating effects and the reduction in the degree of order in the vicinity of the walls .",
    "also , we have studied the effects of the change in pipe size .",
    "we have clarified that for a specific range of the swimming parameter , the system undergoes an order / disorder phase transition when the size of the pipe shrinks .",
    "considering the results of the structural analysis both in pipes and in bulk , we believe that this is due to the intrinsic clustering tendency of the swimmers .",
    "there seems to exist a minimum cluster size which is necessary to maintain the polar order of intermediate pullers .",
    "if we change the shape of the confinement , we found no qualitatively differences , from the view point of the polar order .",
    "these results can be utilized to address the transport problem of microswimmers , however , further studies , like in winding pipes or in pipes with abrupt expansion / contraction are desired for realistic applications .",
