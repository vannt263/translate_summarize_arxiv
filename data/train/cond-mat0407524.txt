    "in the seventies , the orthorhombic perovskite latio@xmath0 was considered as a typical example of an antiferromagnetic mott insulator ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite the ground state of the ti ion is trivalent with a single electron in the @xmath2 shell .",
    "recently , latio@xmath0 has attracted attention when an ordered magnetic moment of 0.46@xmath3 was reported .",
    "@xcite this value is surprisingly small for a single electron with quenched orbital moment , for which one would have expected 1@xmath3 . in latio@xmath0 , this value may be reduced by about 17% due to quantum fluctuations of the 3d heisenberg model , and by about further 14% due to the on - site spin - orbit coupling , ( in conjunction with the crystal field , see below ) , leading to an overall estimate of 0.72@xmath3 .    a previous attempt to explain this unexpected finding has neglected the jahn - teller distortion of the oxygen octahedra in latio@xmath0 and assumed that the symmetry of the unit cell is strictly cubic . in such a situation",
    "the @xmath4 ground state of the ti ion is three - fold degenerate and the orbital moment is unquenched .",
    "hence , it was proposed to consider latio@xmath0 as an orbital liquid in order to explain the reduction of the ordered moment by orbital fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    however , recent experiments give a strong indication of the importance of the jahn - teller distortion in latio@xmath0 , and in particular enable , using recent structural data , to estimate the splitting it induces in the @xmath4 levels : there is a crystal - field gap of about 0.2ev between the non - degenerate ground state and the next excited level .",
    "@xcite this value has been confirmed by a study of photoelectron spectroscopy @xcite and is at least one order of magnitude higher than any superexchange energy in latio@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite consequently , the orbital order at low temperatures is not induced by the superexchange .",
    "rather , the orbital degree of freedom is frozen by the crystal field .",
    "the scenario of suppressed orbital fluctuations has also been confirmed by a recent lda+dmft study .",
    "@xcite the assumption of ref .",
    "that the crystal - field splitting , the superexchange , and the spin - orbit coupling are all of the same order is inconsistent with the photoelectron spectroscopy of ref . .",
    "in addition , a higher value , 0.57@xmath3 , of the ordered moment has been recently reported , @xcite making the discrepancy between experiment and theory ( which gives 0.72@xmath3 ) even smaller .",
    "the jahn - teller effect in latio@xmath0 is caused by the twisting of the ti ",
    "o bonds with respect to each other ( i.e. by differences between the o  o bond lengths ) , rather than by differences between the ti ",
    "o bond lengths .",
    "the non - degenerate ground - state orbital due to crystal - field calculations given in ref .",
    "is consistent with the orbital order found in nmr measurements of the ti3@xmath2 quadrupole moment .",
    "@xcite the presence of orbital order at low temperatures has been also concluded from measurements of the dielectric properties and the dynamical conductivity .",
    "@xcite as opposed to these findings , an orbital contribution to the specific heat , which is predicted by the orbital - liquid model , has not been found in experiment .",
    "@xcite    hence , from the recent experiments it must be concluded that the orbital - liquid model is inappropriate for latio@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , it has been proven , by exact symmetry arguments , that due to a hidden symmetry the superexchange hamiltonian used in ref . can not reproduce the observed magnetic order of latio@xmath0 . @xcite    another model to explain the magnetic properties of latio@xmath0 proposed the lifting of the @xmath4 degeneracy by the crystal field resulting from the eight la ions which surround each tio@xmath5 octahedron  assuming undistorted octahedra , i.e. neglecting the jahn - teller effect .",
    "@xcite this model predicts a realistic non - degenerate ground - state orbital for each ti ion , @xcite and yields plausible values for the heisenberg couplings between nearest - neighbor ti ions .    however , there are two points missing in the calculations of ref . .",
    "( i ) the crystal field due to the eight nearest la ions , which gives a nearly equidistant splitting scheme between the three @xmath4 orbitals , is only a first approximation of the full crystal field due to all ions of the solid .",
    "it is preferable to treat the electrostatic crystal field more accurately , employing the madelung sum .",
    "such a treatment shows that the jahn - teller effect leads to a non - degenerate @xmath4 ground - state orbital and two quasi - degenerate excited orbitals .",
    "@xcite ( ii ) terms of the exchange hamiltonian which break the spin - rotational invariance and cause the magnetic order have not been considered .",
    "hence , the origin of the observed magnetic order is not fully understood so far .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate a model for the magnetism of latio@xmath0 , which starts from a point - charge calculation of the static crystal field for the ti ions via a full madelung sum over the crystal ( as was already discussed in ref . ) .",
