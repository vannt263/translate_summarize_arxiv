    "let @xmath0 be a lattice segment with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. a one dimensional lattice torus with @xmath1 points .",

    "the growth process is a discrete - time markov chain @xmath3 with values in @xmath4 , specified by the following transition probabilities : @xmath5 u_i(t)=_ju_i _",
    "j(t ) ,   i=1,2,  ,n+1 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a certain neighbourhood of site @xmath8 .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is called a _",
    "potential _ of site @xmath8 at time @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the following three possibilities for neighbourhood @xmath7 :    * : @xmath11 , no interaction ; * : @xmath12 , asymmetric interaction ; * : @xmath13 , symmetric interaction ,    where @xmath14 due to periodic boundary conditions in case * ( a2 ) * ; similarly @xmath15 in case * ( a3)*. it should be noted that periodic boundary conditions are imposed for technical reasons only to avoid boundary effects .",
    "the growth process above describes random sequential allocation of particles at the lattice sites , where @xmath16 is the number of particles at site @xmath17 at time @xmath10 .",
    "it is motivated by cooperative sequential adsorption ( csa ) model widely used in physics and chemistry for representation of adsorption processes .",
    "csa is probabilistic in nature and captures the following important feature of adsorption processes .",
    "a molecule diffusing around a certain material surface ( say , a bounded region either of continuous space or lattice ) might get adsorbed by the surface .",
    "the adsorption probability depends on a spatial configuration formed by locations of previously adsorbed particles ; for example , the subsequent particles are more likely to get adsorbed around locations of previously adsorbed particles . in the opposite scenario the adsorbed particles can inhibit adsorption in their neighbourhoods . for additional details and examples we refer the reader to  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the model under consideration relates to a version of csa where the unnormalized adsorption probability at a location depends on the number of particles previously adsorbed in its neighbourhood . in the mostly studied in physics adsorption model ,",
    "namely , random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) , the adsorption probability equals @xmath18 at any location with one or more neighbours and equals @xmath19 otherwise , i.e.  essentially no neighbours are allowed .",
    "asymptotic and statistical studies of csa generalizing rsa ( by allowing any number of neighbours ) were undertaken in  @xcite ; see also  @xcite , where one proposes a model of point process motivated by this csa .",
    "our model can also be regarded as a one - dimensional lattice variant of csa described in  @xcite , where the adsorbing probability takes the form of a product of probabilities associated with each of the adsorbed nearby particles .",
    "indeed , in our model all neighbours contribute the same factor @xmath20 to the product , so that only the number of neighbours is relevant . if @xmath21 , then one expects that adsorption slows down in a saturated region .",
    "another source of motivation has been provided by monomer filling with nearest - neighbour cooperative effects , see p.1289 of  @xcite .",
    "this is a continuous - time model on the lattice with a hard - core type constraint : only a single particle can be adsorbed at a site .",
    "a site s neighbourhood is understood as usual , i.e.  as in our case * ( a3 ) * , and the intensity of adsorption at a site depends on the number of existing neighbours . as a result , there are three non - zero intensities : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , determining the model dynamics in the one - dimensional case .",
    "the main difference of our model from monomer filling is that we allow _ any _ number of particles to be deposited at a site .",
    "the infinite capacity assumption puts our model also into the usual `` balls and bins '' framework of urn models , see  @xcite , with an essential difference resulting form additional interaction between bins .",
    "it is easy to see that in case * ( a1 ) * the model is a particular variant of the well - known urn model ( see a detailed discussion in section [ stab ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that our model in case * ( a1 ) * is closely related to models of neuron growth in biology , in particular to the one considered in  @xcite representing the early stage of neuron growth . in their model probability of adsorption is proportional to the @xmath24-th power of the number of particles at a node ( @xmath25 was used there instead of @xmath26 in our paper ) . the same model with polynomial weights and its generalizations",
    "have been extensively used in modelling a so - called `` positive feedback '' in economics ( e.g. , see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a special limit variant of our model in case * ( a3 ) * ( arising as @xmath27 , see section  [ stab ] ) relates to the models of biological neural networks studied in @xcite .      loosely speaking , _",
    "stability _ of the growth process means that the  profile \" @xmath28 , is ",
    "approximately flat \" , i.e. there are no extraordinary peaks . to describe this property in a formal way we introduce a process of differences @xmath29 where @xmath30 and also for convenience set @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath32 is also a markov chain with the following transition probabilities \\{_i(t+1)=_i(t)+_i , k ,  i=1,2, ",
    ",n ( t)}= and \\{_i(t+1)=_i(t)-1 ,  i=1,2,  ,n ( t)}= , where z((t))=_k=1^n+1^_ju_k_j(t ) . and _ i ,",
    "k&=\\ {    rcl 1 , & & i = k , + 0 , & &    .",
    "we say that the growth process is _ stable _ if the process of differences is an ergodic ( positive recurrent ) markov chain . otherwise the growth process is called _",
    "unstable_.    the following arguments apply when @xmath11 , when our model becomes a particular case of generalized urn model ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath33 represent the numbers of the balls of @xmath1 different types at time @xmath10 ; the probability to pick a ball of a certain type @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath34 , and here @xmath35 . by rubin s construction arguments",

    "j(t ) <   ji},i=1,  ,n+1 , and @xmath36 , then (_i=1^n+1 a_i)=1 . applying the result to our model with @xmath37 , since @xmath38",
    ", we obtain that either @xmath39 for some @xmath40 ( on event @xmath41 ) , or all @xmath42 ( on event @xmath43 ) . in both cases transience of the process of differences",
    "thus , the general result for the urn model implies that the growth process is unstable .    in the opposite situation ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath44 , rubin s results imply that with probability @xmath19 _ all _ components of the growth process grow to infinity and this is the case in our model with @xmath45 .",
    "we prove a stronger result in the case @xmath46 , namely , we show that the distribution of the process of differences _ stabilizes _ , i.e. converges to a stationary distribution .",
    "if @xmath47 , then , regardless of the type of neighbourhood , with probability @xmath19 _ all _ components of the process grow to infinity , but the growth is unstable .",
    "indeed , in this case the process of differences is a zero drift spatially homogenous random walk with bounded jumps which asymptotic behaviour is well - known ( theorem  8.1 , ch .  2 , in @xcite ) . if @xmath48 , then the random walk is transient .",
    "if @xmath49 , then the random walk is recurrent , but it is null recurrence ( as follows from the subsequent arguments ) , therefore the growth is unstable for @xmath49 as well . if , just for this instance , we also allow @xmath50 ( since the process is well - defined in this case as well ) , then the process of differences is just a one - dimensional simple symmetric random walk , which is non - ergodic .",
    "if @xmath49 , then null recurrence of the random walk follows from null recurrence of its coordinates , since each of them is just a one - dimensional symmetric random walk .",
    "thus in the case @xmath47 instability is implied by the properties of zero - drift random walks , therefore this case is completely eliminated from our further considerations .",
    "stability of the growth process is rather intuitive in the no - interaction case , i.e. @xmath11 , if @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , in this case growth slows down at the sites with the maximal potential and accelerates at the sites with the minimal potential resulting in the stability effect , in contrast to the case @xmath37 where growth accelerates at the sites with the maximal potential and no stability is observed .",
    "the picture is not so straightforward for the models with interaction : for instance , it turns out that the growth process is unstable for the model with symmetric interaction for any value of @xmath52 .    to understand possible sources of instability in the models with interaction",
    "it is helpful to consider two other growth processes , which can be viewed as  extreme \" versions of our growth process resulted from letting @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "an easy calculation shows that as @xmath53 the probability to get adsorbed _ not _ at one of the minima converges to @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , a natural interpretation of the formal case `` @xmath55 '' is that at time @xmath56 a particle is allocated equally likely at any site @xmath8 such that @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , `` @xmath58 '' can be interpreted as the situation when at time @xmath56 a particle is allocated equally likely at any site @xmath8 such that @xmath59 .",
    "consider , for instance , the case @xmath55 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see that , depending on the initial configuration , with probability @xmath19 one of the two following events occur : the growth is at even nodes only , the growth is at odd nodes only .",
    "such limit configurations can be called an _ attractor _ of the process by analogy with similar phenomena observed in probabilistic models of biological neural networks ( see  @xcite for details ) . if @xmath62 is arbitrary , then it is also possible to describe _ all _ limit configurations of the growth processes in both `` @xmath63 '' and `` @xmath64 '' cases .",
    "the case `` @xmath64 '' is trivial regardless of the value of @xmath62 and the type of interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the limit behaviour of the growth process corresponding to `` @xmath63 '' is non - trivial in case of an arbitrary @xmath62 for both asymmetric and symmetric interaction , despite quite limited randomness of the process dynamics .",
    "a detailed study of these extreme models is presented in  @xcite .    though our study of stability of the growth process relates also to the study of morphology of random interfaces of growing materials generated by _",
    "ballistic deposition _ processes ( e.g. , see  @xcite and references therein ) , both our setup and the methodology are quite different from the ones used in the present paper , therefore we do not investigate this analogy in further details .      here and further in the paper by _ transience _ of the process @xmath65 we understand @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the usual euclidean norm .",
