    "models of hadronic physics are to be compared with experimental results as well as with our understanding of qcd for large momentum transfers _ and _ for low momentum transfers where feynman diagrams are not useful . in this way",
    ", models may help us in improving our knowledge of qcd for low and intermediate energies of interest to hadronic spectroscopy and eventually nuclear physics .",
    "one way to get this understanding is to note some features present in the perturbative qcd , lattice gauge theory or models of atomic and nuclear physics and check if these features can be used in the low and intermediate energy hadronic physics .",
    "one such feature is an approach based on pair - wise interaction for an interacting multiparticle system ( composed of more than two or three particles ) .",
    "this has been successful in atomic and many - nucleon systems ; the corresponding two - body interaction being described by coulombic and yukawa potential , for example .",
    "the question is if the explicit presence of _ non - abelian _ gluon field can also be replaced by _ two body _ interquark potentials .",
    "the simplest way to use such a model is to try a _",
    "sum _ of two - body potentials or interactions , the usual approach of atomic and nuclear physics . for comparison",
    ", it can be noted that the lowest order perturbative feynman diagrams amplitudes are of this form , and a simple extension of this diagrammatic approach to multiquarks also has this pattern ; see ref .",
    "@xcite , and the later ones in the same approach , where the one gluon exchange potential , though , is replaced by coulombic - plus - linear - plus - hypefine .",
    "if the numerically calculated energies of the four - quark systems on a lattice , in the static quark limit , are compared with a model that use only a _ sum _ of two - quark potentials , the model give a gross overestimate of the ( magnitude of ) four - quark binding energies ; see fig .",
    "4 of the same ref.@xcite .",
    "a gluon field overlap factor @xmath0 was introduced @xcite essentially as a solution to this discrepancy .",
    "this factor multiplied only off - diagonal elements of the overlap , kinetic and potential energy matrices of the otherwise pairwise - sum - based hamiltonian in the three - dimensional basis of the model system of four valence quarks / antiquarks and the purely gluonic field between them .",
    "initially @xcite the geometrical dependence of @xmath0 on the quark positions was chosen purely based on computational convenience and had no known comparison with any qcd simulations .",
    "but when its different forms were compared @xcite with two - colour lattice numerical simulations in the pure gluonic theory , a factor of @xmath3 had to be included in off - diagonal terms of the every version of the potential and overlap matrices ; @xmath4 is the minimal spatial area bounded by four external lines joining the four quarks and @xmath5 is geometrically a constant .",
    "only this way , a version of the model was eventually able to fit well `` 100 pieces of data  the ground and first excited states of configurations from six ( kinds of ) different four - quark geometries ( including squares , rectangles , quadrilaterals and tetrahedra ) calculated on a @xmath6 lattice  with only four independent parameters to describe the interactions connecting the basis states '' .",
    "it is to be noted that this exponential dependence on the spatial area in the model can be possibly traced back to the related use of the space - time area in more familiar models of wilson loops studying time evolutions of a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the connection was first suggested by a wilson loop matrix in a strong coupling expansion scheme ( see figs . 4 and 5 of ref.@xcite ) and",
    "appeared in above mentioned model @xcite of the numerically evaluated wilson loop matrix of the @xmath7 simulations .",
    "a full @xmath8 simulation @xcite performed a bit later again showed the need for @xmath0 model , though detailed geometrical dependence of @xmath0 could not be studied in this 3 colour lattice gauge study . but a later numerical lattice study @xcite by a reputed group of the _ full _ @xmath9 matrix of the wilson loops correlators and of `` the interaction energy of the confining strings in the static rectangular tetraquark system in @xmath10 gluodynamics '' was well modeled again by a surface model , namely their _ soap film _ model that also incorporates ( a flip to ) the multi @xmath11 type linear potential emerging from recent numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the basis state overlap @xmath12 @xcite in the soap film model has a role similar to the gluon field overlap factor @xmath0 of ref.@xcite ; both @xmath0 and @xmath12 appear only in the off - diagonal terms of the respective matrices ( @xmath13 and @xmath1 ) of overlaps of the basis states . continuing on the spatial and space - time areas ,",
    "it can be pointed out that both kind of areas appear in eq.(13 ) of the ref.@xcite and are related to wilson loops as earlier eq.(12 ) there indicates .",
    "actually , above are models of the matrices of pure gluonic theory wilson loops .",
    "the diagonal terms in these matrices are time evolutions of a tetraquark clustering and off - diagonal terms @xcite are for time evolution that start from one tetraquark clustering ( or topology ) and end at another one .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the off - diagonal wilson loops has been perhaps done in refs .",
    "@xcite ( and previous ones by the same group ) and @xcite only . but",
    "the diagonal wilson loops have been studied by many other groups , most familiar being the studies reported in ref.@xcite and the previous works by the same group .",
    "for one set of quark configurations , the diagonal studies are limited to only one wilson loop . in a sense , this means limitation to only one state of the gluonic field as well , namely the one with the least energy _ to which _ system flips ; if there are other states mentioned in the literature , these are either for comparison purpose ( _ from which _ the system flips ) or the excited state `` contaminations '' .",
    "but a general study should _ actually _ incorporate a variety of basis states and thus include off - diagonal wilson loops _ as well_. the spatial area we are working on appears only in the off - diagonal wilson loops and thus our work is not to be confused with the usual study of the diagonal wilson loops effects .",
    "it is to be admitted that works like ref.@xcite have indicated improvements in both evaluations and models of the diagonal wilson loops and we have not included these improvements in our model of the diagonal term . but",
    "this is not a serious flaw , as a dynamical study @xcite using these improved diagonal models mentions in its conclusions and comments that the `` dynamics of ( tetraquark ) binding is dominated by the simple flip - flop term '' , meaning that the essentially new connected string ( butterfly ) term introduced through the work of ref.@xcite is dynamically `` not rewarding '' .",
    "it is to be noted that our diagonal terms include both terms whose minimum is the flip - flop term .",
    "this advocates the @xmath14 form of @xmath0 for static two quarks and two antiquarks . for a comparison with actual ( hadron ) experiments",
    ", we have to incorporate quark motion as well , possibly through using quark wave functions .",
    "the resulting four - body schrdinger equation can be solved , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , variationally for the ground state of the system and the effective meson - meson potentials .",
    "alternatively , the hamiltonian emerging from the @xmath15 model has been diagonalized in the simple harmonic oscillator basis @xcite , or was sandwiched between the external meson wave functions to give a transition amplitude of the _ born diagrams _ @xcite that is related to meson - meson phase shifts .",
    "we have used a formalism ( resonating group method @xcite ) that was , for the @xmath15 system , originally @xcite used in a way that allowed finding _ inter - meson _ dependence with the dependence on a quark - antiquark distance being pre - fixed .",
    "the formalism allows using the best available knowledge of a meson wave function , though a simple gaussian form for the wave functions and correspondingly a quadratic quark - antiquark potential was used for computational convenience .",
    "we have used this same formalism that can be generalized to using realistic meson wave functions and finding the inter - cluster dependence .",
    "but because of the additional computational problems due to a totally non - separable exponential of ( a negative constant times ) area in @xmath0 , presently we had to also pre - specify a plane - wave form of the inter - cluster dependence along with still using gaussian wave functions ; effectively this means using a born approximation as well .",
    "we have pointed out , though , that these wave function approximations are better than what their naive impression conveys : the gaussian dependence on the quark - antiquark distance has the potential of resembling the realistic meson wave functions through an adjustment of its parameters @xcite . and the plane wave form of the inter - cluster dependence is justified through a feeble inter - cluster ( meson - meson ) interaction noted in previous works @xcite ; the meson - meson phase shifts resulting from this work are also much less than a radian .",
    "_ only by using the born - approximation _ , the resulting coupled integral equations for inter - cluster wave functions could be decoupled in this work .",
    "this decoupling allowed us to numerically calculate the off - diagonal elements as nine - dimensional integrals for the components of the eventual four position 3-vectors ; only the overall center - of - mass dependence could be analytically dealt with in a trivial manner . before this numerical integration , for the kinetic energy terms we had to differentiate the area in @xmath0 .",
    "the form of area used in the detailed form of the @xmath16 model , that we take from ref .",
    "@xcite , has square roots of the functions of our position variables .",
    "thus a differentiation of this area form yields in denominators combinations of position variables that become zero somewhere in the ranges of integrations to be later done .",
    "the numerical evaluations of the resulting nine - dimensional improper integrals is expected to be too demanding , as our initial explorations indicated .",
    "thus , for the to - be - differentiated right @xmath17 part of the some kinetic energy terms we replaced the area by an approximated quadratic form whose differentiation does not result in negative powers of the position variables .",
    "we also find that the use of the @xmath0 factor in the new form reduces the long range meson - meson interaction and thus as usual solves the well known van der walls force problem @xcite with the otherwise naive sum of one gluon exchange pair - wise interaction .",
    "it has been said @xcite that dynamically it is not a serious problem because of the quark - antiquark pair creation and because of the wave function damping of the large distance configurations .",
    "though ref .",
    "@xcite partly incorporated both the quark - antiquark pair creation and the meson wave functions and still showed a need for the @xmath0 factor , through the present work we want to point out that the dynamical role of the @xmath0 factor in meson - meson interactions is _ not limited _ to solving van der walls force problem or pointing out @xcite otherwise over - binding in certain meson - meson systems .",
    "the @xmath0 factor points certain features ( non - separability of @xmath0 ) of qcd that are 1 ) indicated by lattice simulations and 2 ) can be compared with actual experiments .",
    "there have been recent hadron - level studies @xcite@xcite using the above mentioned improved models of the diagonal wilson loops .",
    "but the quark level limitations of the models @xcite@xcite mean similar limitations for the hadron - level results : @xcite@xcite study the properties ( like binding energy and _ direct potential _",
    "@xcite ) of the ground state itself ( or in isolation ) , whereas we aim to study the dynamical coupling of a tetraquark state to other basis state(s ) of the tetraquark system  essentially to the other clustering or the exchanged channel .",
    "thus , as we say in the abstract , in addition to doing the phase - shift calculations for a meson - meson scattering , we study a coupling that can affect even the ground state itself through a second order perturbation theory effect named polarization potential @xcite .",
    "that is , after including the quark mass differences , a meson - meson state may not be degenerate with an exchanged channel and thus the coupling between this state and the exchanged intermediate one ( a hadron loop ) may help resolve the underlying structure of a possible meson - meson state .",
    "such a state may be a meson - meson molecule that can be formed by the ground state .",
    "this also makes a study of the dynamical coupling of a meson - meson channel to exchanged one worth pursuing .    in section 2",
    "we have written the total state vector of the @xmath15 system as in rgm , along with introducing the hamiltonian @xmath18 of the system without the @xmath0 factor and then modifying @xmath18 through the @xmath0 . in section 3",
    "different position dependent forms of @xmath0 have been described , including the approximate forms that we had to use . in section 4",
    "we have solved the integral equations for a meson meson molecule in the absence of spin degrees of freedom and with all equal quark masses .",
    "this section ends with a prescription to find the phase shifts . in the last section we have presented the numerical values of the phase shifts for different forms of @xmath0 , for different values of free parameter @xmath19 and for different values of angle @xmath20 between @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "using adiabatic approximation we can write the total state vector of a system containing two quarks two antiquarks and the gluonic field between them as a sum of the product of the quarks ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) position dependent function @xmath25 and the gluonic field state @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath26 is defined as a state which approaches @xmath27 in the weak coupling limit , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in lattice simulations of the corresponding ( gluonic )",
    "wilson loops it is found that the lowest eigenvalue of the wilson matrix , that is energy of the lowest state , is always the same for both @xmath31 and @xmath32 matrices provided that @xmath33 or @xmath34 has the lowest energy @xcite .",
    "the later calculations @xcite of the tetraquark system were also done with a two level approximation .",
    "taking advantage of these observations , we have included in our expansion only two basis states . as in resonating group method , @xmath25 or @xmath35 is written as product of known dependence on @xmath36 and unknown dependence on @xmath37 .",
    "i.e. @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is the center of mass coordinate of the whole system , @xmath40 is the vector joining the center of mass of the clusters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the position vector of quark 1 with respect to @xmath44 within the cluster @xmath41 and @xmath45 is the position vector of quark 2 with respect to @xmath46 within the cluster @xmath42 .",
    "the same applies to @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the clusters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "similarly we can define @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the clusters @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "or we can write them in terms of position vector of the four particles ( quarks or antiquarks ) as follow @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 thus meson meson state vector in the restricted gluonic basis is written as @xmath58 here @xmath59 and @xmath60 . these gaussian forms of meson wave functions",
    "are , strictly speaking , the wave functions of a quadratic confining potential .",
    "but , as pointed out in text below fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the overlap of a gaussian wave function and the eigenfunction of the realistic linear plus colombic potential can be made as close as 99.4% by properly adjusting its parameter @xmath61 .",
    "a realistic value of @xmath61 mimicking a realistic meson wave function depends on the chosen scattering mesons and thus is postponed to our future work @xcite . presently , to explore the qualitative implications of the geometric features of the gluonic overlap factor @xmath0 , we have used in @xmath62 and @xmath63 a value @xmath64 fm defined by the relation @xmath65 @xcite , with @xmath66 fm being the r.m.s .",
    "charge radius of the qqq system whose wave function is derived by using the same quadratic confining potential .",
    "as for the hamiltonian , for @xmath0=1 the total hamiltonian @xmath18 of our 4-particle system is taken as @xcite @xmath67 + \\sum_{i < j}^{\\overline{4 } } v(\\textbf{r}_{ij})\\mathbf{f}_{i}.\\mathbf{f}_{j}.\\label{e9}\\ ] ] our same constituent quark mass value @xmath68 for all quarks and antiquarks is one used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and our kinetic energy operator is similarly non - relativistic ; it is included in our aims to compare with this work and isolate the effects only due to a different expression for the @xmath0 . in above each of @xmath69 has @xmath70 components @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 are gell - mann matrices operating on the @xmath75-th particle ; @xmath76 is shown as a superscript only to avoid any possible confusion with subscript @xmath75 which labels a particle .    for the pairwise @xmath77",
    "potential , we have used a quadratic confinement @xmath78 for exploratory study . while we have neglected short range coulomb like interactions as well as spin - dependent terms .",
    "along with that non relativistic limit has also been taken . the model used by vijande @xcite",
    "is also restricted to these limits . as for the within - a - cluster dependence of the wave function",
    ", this use of the quadratic potential in place of the realistic coulumbic plus linear may change the full wave function . in the within - a - cluster",
    ", this change of wave function is found to result in a change of an overlap integral from 100% to 99.4% only provided the parameter @xmath61 of the wave function is adjusted .",
    "although the expression for @xmath79 written immediately after eq.([e20 ] ) suggests a way to connect the additional parameter of the full wave function with that of a cluster , it is difficult to make a similar overlap test for the full wave function .",
    "but there is no a priori reason to deny that at least the qualitative features ( like a new kind of angle dependence mentioned in the results part ) we want to point out using this quadratic confinement would survive in a more realistic calculation ; a similar exploration of the @xmath15 system properties was first done @xcite using a quadratic confinement and later extended and improved calculation @xcite with more realistic pair - wise interaction reinforced the @xmath80 results obtained initially through the quadratic confinement .",
    "it seems that a proper adjustment the parameters of the quadratic ( or sho ) model can reasonably simulate a @xmath81 or even a @xmath15 system . in our case , this adjustment of the parameters can be done once a choice of actual scattering mesons is made in a formalism @xcite that incorporates spin and flavour degrees of freedom .",
    "but , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) of ref.@xcite , properties of the @xmath15 system may not be very sensitive to the actual values of the parameters and we expect our presently chosen values of the parameters to well indicate the essential features resulting from the non - separable form of the gluonic field overlap factor @xmath0 .    for the central simple harmonic oscillator potential of eq.([e16 ] ) , the above mentioned size @xmath61 in the eigenfunctions @xmath62 and @xmath82 is related to the quadratic coefficient @xmath83 which thus is given a value of @xmath84 .    as in a resonating group calculation , we take only variations in the @xmath85 factor of the total state vector of the system written in eq.([e11 ] ) . setting the coefficients of linearly independent arbitrary variations",

    "@xcite , the normalization , potential energy and kinetic energy matrices in the corresponding gluonic basis are @xmath91    @xmath92    and    @xmath93    this is the modification , through the @xmath0 factor , to the hamiltonian as much as we need it for the integral equations below in section 4 ( that is only the modified matrix elements ) .",
    "@xcite supports through a comparison with numerical lattice simulations a form of @xmath0 that was earlier @xcite suggested through a quark - string model extracted from the strong coupling lattice hamiltonian gauge theory .",
    "this is @xmath94 s being the area of minimal surface bounded by external lines joining the position of the two quarks and two antiquarks , and @xmath95 is the standard string tension @xcite , @xmath96 is a dimensionless parameter whose value of 0.57 was decided in ref .",

    "it is shown there @xcite that the parameters , including @xmath96 , extracted at this @xmath97 lattice simulation with @xmath98 can be used directly in , for example , a resonating group calculation of a four quark model as the continuum limit is achieved for this value of @xmath99 .",
    "the simulations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite were done in the 2-colour approximation .",
    "but , for calculating the dynamical effects , we use actual su(3 ) colour matrix elements of ref .",
    "the only information we take from the computer simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite is value of @xmath19 .",
    "this describes a geometrical property of the gluonic field ( its spatial rate of decrease to zero ) and it may be the case that the geometrical properties of the gluonic field are not much different for different number of colours , as suggested for example by successes of the geometrical flux tube model . situation is more clear , though , for the mass spectra and the string tension generated by the gluonic field : ref .",

    "their preliminary calculations in 3 + 1 dimensions indicate a similar trend . directly for the parameter @xmath96 , appearing in the overlap factor @xmath0 studied in this work , the similar conclusion can be drawn from a comparison of the mentioned lattice calculations @xcite on the interaction energy of the two heavy - light @xmath102 mesons in the realistic @xmath100 gauge theory with ref .",
    "@xcite that uses @xmath97 . for interpreting the results in terms of the potential for the corresponding single heavy - light meson ( @xmath103 ) , a gaussian form @xmath104 of the gluonic filed overlap factor @xmath0",
    "is used in this ref .",
    "@xcite for numerical convenience and not the minimal area form .",
    "but for a particular geometry , the two exponents ( the minimal area and the sum of squared distances ) in these two forms of @xmath0 are related and thus for a particular geometry a comparison of the parameter @xmath96 multiplying area and corresponding ( different ! ) @xmath96 multiplying sum of squares in eq .",
    "( 14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite is possible .",
    "we note that , after correcting for a ratio of 8 between the sum of distance squares ( including two diagonals ) and the area for the square geometry , the colour - number - generated relative difference for this geometry is just @xmath105 : the coefficient is @xmath106 multiplying sum of squared distances and @xmath107 multiplying the minimal area .",
    "but , as the precise form of @xmath0 is still under development ( the latest work @xcite has covered only a very limited selection of the positions of tetraquark constituents ) and the expression for the area in its exponent needs improvement , it is not sure precisely what value of the @xmath96 best simulates qcd and we have mainly worked with an approximate value of 0.5 that is also mentioned in ref.@xcite and is numerically easier to deal with .",
    "( it is to be noted that the soap film model of ref.@xcite does not treat @xmath96 as a variational parameter .",

    "( as long as all the functions , including the meson wave functions and the gluonic field overlap factor @xmath0 , are separate in @xmath40 and @xmath118 , we can everywhere replace @xmath167 and @xmath168 by their analytical integrals which themselves simply multiply if @xmath167 and @xmath168 do , can solve the resulting linear equations for these integrals and can write the @xmath1 matrices and phase shifts directly in terms of these integrals .",
    "this is what is done in ref.@xcite@xcite , but it is hard to think how to generalize this very specialized technique to a case like us where the @xmath0 factor is not separable in @xmath40 and @xmath118 . ) compelled to use , thus , born approximation ( something already in use @xcite for meson - meson scattering ; our numerical results mentioned below also justify its use here ) for this we used the solutions of eqs.([e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) in absence of interactions ( say by letting @xmath96 approach to infinity , meaning @xmath169 ) for @xmath137 and @xmath160 .",
    "we chose the coefficient of these plane wave solutions so as to make @xmath137 as fourier transform of @xmath170 and @xmath160 as fourier transform of @xmath171 , with @xmath172 and @xmath173 defined below just after eq.([e20 ] ) .",

    "using the relation @xmath188 or @xmath189 between @xmath190 matrix and the @xmath1 matrix ( actually in the form of elements @xmath191 for @xmath192 ) we got different results for phase shifts for different values of center of mass kinetic energy @xmath193 and the angle @xmath20 between @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; we have used the born approximation to neglect higher powers in the exponential series .",
    "we also probed different values of the parameter @xmath96 .    for a comparison",
    ", we also did the much less time consuming ( but approximate ) calculation using @xmath126 in place of @xmath109 in eq.([e10 ] ) .",
    "this allowed us separating the @xmath194 variables dependence of the integrand as a product , resulting in three triple integrals to be only multiplied , making the convergence very fast in the numerical computation of the integral .",
    "thus we had instead    @xmath195      here    @xmath197 ,    @xmath198 ,    @xmath199 , + @xmath200 $ ] ,    @xmath201 $ ] + @xmath202.$ ]    for this choice of @xmath109 , we also calculated the phase shifts that are reported in the next section .    by treating eq.([e3 ] ) in the same fashion as that of eq.([e2 ] ) and using the born approximation @xmath203 it was checked that the results for phase shifts remain same .",
    "actually eq.([e3 ] ) and eq.([e2 ] ) become identical if we interchange @xmath40 and @xmath118 .",
    "fig.[graph1 ] shows our results , with @xmath96 defined by eq.([e6 ] ) taken as 0.5 , for the phase shifts for a selection of center of mass kinetic energies for different angles between @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( some numerical uncertainty appears at @xmath204 for @xmath205 .",
    "when we further explored the region between @xmath206 and @xmath207 there appeared fluctuations in the results .",
    "for smoothness in graph we have neglected the data point at @xmath204 in fig.[graph1 ] at @xmath205 and interpolated data points are taken there . )    we found no numerical fluctuations for kinetic energies above @xmath207 , and thus we conclude that in this kinematical range the scattering angle has large effect on phase shifts , indicating a true gluonic field effect .",
    "( the origin of this angle dependence is the exponent @xmath109 which is essentially in a model of @xmath208 wilson loop , a pure gluonic theory expectation value ; we do not get any angle dependence if this @xmath109 is not used .",
    "so the angle dependence emerges from gluonic field related to the area law , and is thus a qcd effect . ) by increasing the scattering angle the phase shifts become large .",
    "we noted that a faster convergence of the nine - dimensional integration ( see eq.([e40 ] ) ) for large kinetic energy values was possible for smaller values of the parameter @xmath96 ; for a decrease in @xmath19 of 0.1 the cpu time reduced at least three times to that for the previous value .",
    "thus we used the smaller value of @xmath209 mentioned in ref.@xcite to get phase shifts for a larger set of kinetic energies resulting in smoother graphs . for the above mentioned value @xmath210 ( meaning @xmath211 and @xmath212 fm ) used in ref.@xcite ( giving the 99.4% overlap of the wave functions ) we found that , at @xmath213 , there is about a @xmath214 degree change in phase shift for a @xmath215 degree change in scattering angle @xmath20 , even larger in magnitude than the phase shifts of fig.[graph1 ] for the corresponding @xmath193 given by our routine value @xmath216 fm .",
    "so we can say that the characteristic feature of angle dependence will remain if we study the scattering of some realistic meson meson system by taking sizes of mesons accordingly and adjust the parameters of the gaussian wave functions to simulate realistic linear plus columbic potential eigenfunctions .    for a comparison with the other crude forms of @xmath0 previously used , we show in the following fig.[graph2 ] the average of these @xmath209 phase shifts over our selection of angle @xmath20 values along with the corresponding phase shifts for other forms of @xmath0 i.e. exponent in @xmath0 being proportional to @xmath126 , @xmath217 and zero ;",
    "the phase shifts were found to be independent of the angle @xmath20 for all these older forms of @xmath0 and hence there was no need to take any angle - average for these other forms .",
    "this figure shows that in comparison to @xmath218 ( sum of two body potential model ) we get relatively very small coupling with @xmath109 , @xmath126 and gaussian form in @xmath0 .",
    "the introduction of a many - body interaction in the previous ( gaussian ) form of @xmath0 resulted in a reduced meson - meson interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite this reduction was noted as decreased meson - meson phase shifts .",
    "so there are less chances of making a bound state with modifications in sum of two body approach i.e. the inclusion of gluonic field effects significantly decrease coupling between two mesons in a @xmath219 system .",
    "phase shifts are much less than @xmath214 radian which indicates the validity of born approximation .",
    "the phase shifts we get are lesser than reported by others who have used born approximation @xcite but not used @xmath0 factor in off - diagonal terms .",
    "it is to be noted that the @xmath125 form also does not result in any angle dependence , although in contrast to the @xmath220 and gaussian form there is apparently no a priori reason to expect such an angle independence for the use of @xmath125 .",
    "this may be because @xmath125 is almost gaussian with a little mixture of @xmath221 and @xmath222 terms ( see eq.([e21 ] ) and the parameter values reported just below it ) or because @xmath125 can be converted to a gaussian form by a completing of squares .",
    "as for a comparison of the @xmath125 phase shifts with the angle - average of the @xmath109 phase shifts , it can be pointed out that the height of phase shift with @xmath125 became less than that with original @xmath109 but the shape remains identical .",
    "perhaps this indicates that @xmath126 simulates well some variations resulting from the original @xmath109 form . in fig.[graph2 ] , if we compare graph of gaussian form with the angle averaged phase shifts using @xmath109 in @xmath0 we find that as compared to gaussian form the graph of other forms is closer to @xmath218 , though the height of graph with @xmath218 is still very large as compared to both gaussian form of @xmath0 and that of @xmath109 in @xmath0 ; see fig.[graph7 ] which clarifies any ambiguity , if so , in fig.[graph2 ] about the @xmath96=0 results .",
    "fig.[graph3 ] reports most of the results for the higher values 0.57 of @xmath96 mentioned in ref .",
    "this value is more precise for their form of model and the crude area expression in the exponent in it .",
    "but our numerical calculations for this value turned out to be more demanding and thus were done for a smaller selection of kinetic energies .",
    "the numerical uncertainties for this value are for @xmath223 and the kinetic energy between @xmath224 and @xmath225 ; the results for this value of @xmath20 are in fig.[graph5 ] .",
    "a value of @xmath226 higher than 0.5 and 0.57 mentioned above has been reported in ref .",
    "although this work analyzes a relatively limited collection of geometries ( only squares and tilted rectangles ) , we have tried to see effects of using a higher @xmath96 .",
    "the numerical problems for large @xmath96 implied in the above mentioned numerical convenience for smaller @xmath96 did not allow us to get results for @xmath96=1 in a manageable time even for @xmath213 .",
    "the best we could do was to do a number of calculations for @xmath227 ; the resulting phase shifts from these are shown in fig.[graph4 ] except for the phase shifts for @xmath228 that are reported in fig.[graph6 ] , showing some numerical uncertainties at the kinetic energy=@xmath229 and at @xmath230 . based on fig.[graph4 ] and",
    "fig.[graph6 ] , we expect that for higher values of @xmath19 the results will remain qualitatively same and do not expect any new feature to emerge for @xmath231 .",
    "we did a partial wave analysis for the phase shifts in fig .",
    "[ graph1 ] . for this",
    "we have projected our angle dependence on @xmath232 spherical harmonics .",
    "the angle dependence is independent of azimuthal angle @xmath233 so the partial wave expansion will only contain terms independent of angle @xmath233 or terms with m=0 .",
    "this analysis shows that below @xmath234 the s - wave is very much dominant as can be seen by a sharp rise of graphs towards lower side in fig .",
    "[ graph8 ] and fig .",
    "[ graph9 ] near @xmath234 and it is also justified from fig .",
    "[ graph1 ] which shows a @xmath20 independence below @xmath234 i.e. purely an s - wave .",
    "our partial wave analysis shows that only even partial waves are present .",
    "furthermore partial wave phase shifts decrease as we go from s - wave to i - wave , as is clear from large reciprocals in fig .",
    "[ graph9 ] , and they become negligible as compared to corresponding s - wave phase shifts as we go beyond g - wave .",
    "so here in figs .",
    "( [ graph8],[graph9 ] ) only s / d and s / g ratios are plotted .",
    "the reason for the absence of odd partial waves is that our phase shifts are symmetric around @xmath223 and the product of an even and odd function is an odd function giving rise to a zero result after integration .",
    "thus phase shift is different for different angle and partial wave analysis of this angle dependence indicates presence of @xmath235 spherical harmonics along with the angle independent @xmath236 .",
    "we have found this extra presence of d , g waves in angle dependence only when we use @xmath237 form of @xmath0 .",
    "but when @xmath0 is spherically symmetric , i.e. old gaussian form , then there appears no d , g waves",
    ". thus d , g waves must be a property of @xmath237 .",
    "so @xmath237 may couple an l=0 meson - meson system to l=2 , 4 , ... etc",
    ". systems .",
    "this means two possibilities 1 ) l=0 meson - meson system may have t - matrix and phase shifts to l=2 , 4 , ... final state meson - meson systems and 2 ) l=0 may couple to l=2 , 4 , ... states as intermediate states in a polarization potential @xcite , through @xmath237 .",
