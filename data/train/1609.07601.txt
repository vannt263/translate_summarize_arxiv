    "in this paper we are concerned with the existence of ( unique ) scalar - valued lipschitz solutions to the dirichlet problem @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a bounded , regular domain and with regular prescribed boundary values  @xmath3 .",
    "the focus is on coefficient functions @xmath4 , which on the one hand represent a radial structure condition and which on the other belong to a convex linear growth problem which is naturally formulated in the sobolev space @xmath5 , meaning that we work under the permanent assumption that the function @xmath6 is increasing and remains bounded . in this setting , the existence of a weak solution to the dirichlet problem   is equivalent to the existence of a minimizer of a related ( convex ) variational integral in the dirichlet class @xmath7 , and we may equivalently look for a function @xmath8 such that for all smooth , compactly supported test function @xmath9 we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are linked via the identity @xmath13    the minimal surface equation is clearly the most prominent example for such a dirichlet problem , and other prototypic examples are given via the coefficient functions @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( which for the specific case @xmath17 is just the minimal surface equation ) .",
    "one peculiarity of linear growth problems is that , even if the equation   is monotone and the integrand @xmath18 of the variational functional is convex , standard monotonicity methods and the direct method of the calculus of variations fail in general , since the sobolev space @xmath5 is non - reflexive and hence has insufficient compactness properties . for the study of such linear growth problem of variational type ,",
    "one common strategy is to extend in a first step the functional by lower semicontinuity ( in the sense of lebesgue and serrin  @xcite ) to the larger space @xmath19 of functions of bounded variation , i.e. , to consider , for fixed boundary values  @xmath3 , the functional @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "this extension also allows for an integral representation , see e.g.  @xcite , which consists in the original functional evaluated for the absolutely continuous part of the measure derivative and penalization terms for non - vanishing singular measure derivative or non - attainment of the prescribed boundary values ( note that the trace operator is in general not continuous with respect to weak-@xmath22 convergence in @xmath19 ) . in a second step , one can then study minimizers of the extended functional in @xmath19 ( which can be interpreted as generalized minimizers of the original functional ) , which exist as a consequence of the direct method , applied in @xmath19 equipped with the weak-@xmath22-topology ( the lower semicontinuity was established by reshetnyak  @xcite ) .    returning to the original question , one can then investigate whether or not these generalized minimizers belong to @xmath23 ( which amounts to excluding the singular measure derivative and to show attainment of the boundary values ) .",
    "however , this is in general not the case , meaning that in fact no minimizer in the space @xmath23 might exist .",
    "this situation has indeed been studied in full detail for the minimal surface equation , and a by now classical result by miranda  @xcite states that for any locally pseudoconvex domain  @xmath24 and any continuous prescribed boundary values  @xmath3 a unique minimizer @xmath25 exists . moreover , this result is sharp , and neither the convexity assumption nor the regularity assumption on @xmath3 can be considerably weakened in order to guarantee the existence of minimizers in @xmath23 .",
    "concerning higher regularity of such generalized minimizers , let us mention briefly that bildhauer and fuchs  @xcite have investigated , also for the vectorial case , the role of the so - called @xmath26-ellipticity condition , which quantifies the degeneration of the second order derivatives of the integrand ( which in our case would basically mean @xmath27 for @xmath28 ) . here ,",
    "mild degeneration @xmath29 ( plus some additional assumptions , as radial structure of the integrand ) still allows to prove that the generalized minimizers introduced before are actually of class @xmath30 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.7 ) , but also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  b ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.3 ) ) , while in the limit case with degeneration @xmath31 ( as for the area functional ) it is still possible to show that they belong to @xmath5 , with improved @xmath32 integrability of the gradients ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.5 ) and ( * ? ? ? * corollary  1.13 ) ) .",
    "however , these paper focus primarily on the regularity of generalized minimizers , and attainment of the prescribed boundary values  @xmath3 is in fact not expected in this general setting , as highlighted above .    in the present paper",
    ", we proceed with an alternative ( and also very classical ) strategy , which directly addresses the minimization problem ( or equivalently dirichlet problem ) , without passing through the relaxed formulation .",
    "indeed , the goal is to characterize integrands  @xmath11 ( or equivalently coefficient functions  @xmath12 ) , in terms of properties of  @xmath11 only , such that the minimization or dirichlet problem admits a solution in @xmath23 , for any ( regular ) domain  @xmath24 and boundary values  @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the dirichlet problem in the planar case  @xmath33 for the second order elliptic equation @xmath34 ( with the convention @xmath35 ) was already investigated by bernstein  @xcite , in terms of the bernstein genre  @xmath36 defined via the validity of @xmath37 for some constants @xmath38 ( if well - defined ) , and then generalized by leray  @xcite .",
    "one can easily calculate that the bernstein genre of the equation for the prototypic coefficients  @xmath39 from   is given by  @xmath40 ( hence , the minimal surface equation is of bernstein genre  @xmath41 ) .",
    "bernstein s discovery in  @xcite was that the question of the solvability of the dirichlet problem splits into the two classes of genre @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "while for the first class the dirichlet problem is in general solvable , one needs to impose curvature restriction on the second class ( as the convexity conditioned mentioned before in miranda s result ) .",
    "an extension to the higher - dimensional case @xmath44 and a systematic treatment of more general non - uniformly elliptic equations of the form   was given later by serrin  @xcite .",
    "he defined the equation to be _ regularly elliptic _",
    "if @xmath45 holds for some increasing function @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 obviously , equations with a well - defined bernstein genre  @xmath36 are regularly elliptic if and only if @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , our specific equation   is regularly elliptic in particular if the left - hand side in   is increasing and if we have in addition @xmath49 the relevance of the structure condition   consists in the fact that it implies a priori estimates for the gradient of solutions on the boundary , via the construction of so - called _ global barriers functions _ , and interior a priori bounds follow in turn . since the existence of solutions to the dirichlet problem can be reduced to the proof of a priori estimates , serrin obtained as a consequence that regularly elliptic dirichlet problems allow for a solution , for arbitrary ( regular ) domains and prescribed boundary values ( while for non - regularly elliptic equations it is in general again necessary to impose restrictions on the domain , e.g. on the curvatures of the boundary  @xmath50 ) .",
    "the main result of the present article concerns the solvability of the dirichlet problem in @xmath7 and higher regularity of the solution in the sense of lipschitz continuity , which we prove simultaneously , following the strategy of serrin s work  @xcite .",
    "we here work under a radial structure condition , which allows for an easier construction of barriers , and we work under a bounded oscillation assumption , which in some sense acts as a substitute for the monotonicity assumption of the function  @xmath51 introduced above .",
    "we then obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of the dirichlet problem , in terms of an integral condition as in  , and the precise statement is the following :    [ t1 ] let @xmath52 be a strictly convex function with @xmath53 which satisfies , for some constants @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\label{a1}\\ ] ] then the following statements are equivalent :    1",
    ".   for arbitrary domains @xmath24 of class @xmath56 satisfying an exterior ball condition and arbitrary prescribed boundary values @xmath57 there exists a unique function @xmath58 solving  .",
    "the function @xmath11 satisfies @xmath59    the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] will be divided into two parts . in section  [ nonexistence ]",
    "we first deal with the failure of the existence of lipschitz solutions to some regular boundary value problem to   if the assumption   is not satisfied , by an adaptation of an example constructed by finn  @xcite for the minimal surface equation .",
    "we here emphasize that this non - existence result concerns the _ general _ solvability of the dirichlet problem , and in fact , some restricted solvability results , for specific ( non - convex ) domains and boundary values , might still be true even if   is violated , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is then devoted to the proof of existence of lipschitz solutions if assumption   holds . to this end , we provide in section  [ auxiliary ] some auxiliary lemmata , before proceeding in section  [ main_proof ] to the main proof , which consists of a number of steps .",
    "first , since the existence of solutions can not be addressed directly , we perform an approximation of the original dirichlet problem by a family of dirichlet problems exhibiting a quadratic growth condition ( thus , admitting solutions in @xmath60 by the direct method ) .",
    "then , the passage to the limit yields a lipschitz solution with boundary values  @xmath3 ( and not only a generalized solution ) if we can show uniform @xmath61 estimates for the solutions of the approximate problems .",
    "this is achieved by the construction of appropriate barrier functions , in the tradition of serrin s paper  @xcite , and concludes the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] .",
    "finally , it is worth to mention that the integral condition   is trivially satisfied ( and hence that every dirichlet problem is solvable ) if  @xmath11 satisfies the aforementioned @xmath26-ellipticity condition studied by bildhauer and fuchs for some @xmath62 $ ] , thus providing a connection to the first approach to the minimization problem via relaxation .",
    "moreover , we have recovered that the dirichlet problem in the prototypic example with coefficients   is in general solvable for arbitrary regular domains and boundary values if and only if @xmath63 holds .",
    "concerning the assumptions on the domain and the function  @xmath11 , let us note :    1 .",
    "a domain  @xmath24 satisfies the exterior ball condition if there exists a number @xmath64 such that for every point  @xmath65 there is a ball @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "convexity or @xmath68-regularity of the domain are sufficient for the exterior ball condition , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.9 . ) , thus , theorem  [ t1 ] holds in particular for all convex domains of class @xmath56 and for arbitrary domains of class @xmath68 .",
    "2 .   for simplicity , but without loss of generality , we can restrict ourselves in the whole paper to functions  @xmath11 which satisfy @xmath69 since the dirichlet problem is invariant under addition and multiplication by a constant to @xmath11 .",
    "notice for the second relation that the function  @xmath70 is monotonically increasing by convexity of  @xmath11 and therefore has a limit as @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , strict positivity and finiteness of this limit follow from   and lhpital s rule , which also shows that the two limits in   coincide .",
    "3 .   with a change of variables and the normalization from the previous remark , we have @xmath72 since the latter integral can be rewritten via the conjugate function @xmath73 which appears in the dual formulation of the dirichlet problem in the sense of convex analysis as @xmath74 , we observe that condition   is satisfied if and only if the conjugate function  @xmath75 explodes when approaching the boundary of its domain .",
    "let us note that the result of theorem  [ t1 ] could in fact be extended to less regular settings .",
    "one possibility is to consider convex functions  @xmath11 which are of class @xmath76 only for large value .",
    "since precisely only large gradients need to be avoided ( uniformly ) for the solutions to the approximative problems , such an asymptotic condition is in general sufficient ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.2 ) for a related result ) . moreover , if one is interested only in the existence of solutions in @xmath7 ( and not necessarily lipschitz ) , one might work on domains which are only piece - wise of class  @xmath68 and for more general ( not lipschitz ) boundary values @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude the introduction with some comments on the notation used throughout the paper . for a set",
    "@xmath77 in  @xmath78 we write  @xmath79 for its topological boundary and  @xmath80 for its closure . furthermore ,",
    "for points in @xmath78 we use bold letters ( like @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) , and the open ball in @xmath78 wither center  @xmath82 and radius  @xmath83 is denoted by @xmath84 .",
    "concerning function spaces , we work with the standard lebesgue spaces  @xmath85 and sobolev spaces  @xmath86 , for @xmath87 $ ] , and we abbreviate the respective norms by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , when the domain of reference is clear from the context .",
    "we first show the necessity of assumption   for the existence of lipschitz minimizers to any regular boundary value problem to  . in what follows ,",
    "we provide a simple example of a regular domain  @xmath24 and regular boundary values  @xmath3 for which no lipschitz solution ( and in fact also no @xmath0 solution ) to   exists .",
    "the construction is motivated by a well - known counterexample due to finn  @xcite for the minimal surface equation with @xmath90 , and we shall also here work on the annulus @xmath91 and with boundary values  @xmath3 which are constant on every connected component of  @xmath50 , that is , we consider @xmath92 for some positive number @xmath93 ( to be specified later ) .",
    "moreover , we take @xmath94 as in theorem  [ t1 ] satisfying @xmath95 for some positive constant @xmath96 and , without loss of generality , also the normalization assumption  .",
    "thanks to the strict convexity of  @xmath11 , the monotonicity of  @xmath97 and the radial symmetry of both the domain and the prescribed boundary values , the lipschitz ( or even @xmath0 ) solution to  , if it exists , is radially symmetric and can consequently be written as @xmath98 for all @xmath99 and some ( lipschitz ) function @xmath100 \\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "thus , we also have @xmath103 for almost all @xmath99 . in order to find a representation formula of @xmath104 , we take an arbitrary function @xmath105)$ ] and extend it radially to a function @xmath9 by setting @xmath106",
    ". then we test the weak formulation of   with @xmath107 and find , by @xmath108 , the transformation to polar coordinates and the radial symmetry of both functions  @xmath104 and  @xmath51 , the identity @xmath109 with @xmath110 the lebesgue measure of the unit ball in @xmath78 ( and hence @xmath111 the @xmath112-dimensional hausdorff measure of the unit sphere in @xmath78 ) . since @xmath105)$ ] was arbitrary ,",
    "we deduce in a first step @xmath113 for some constant @xmath114 and all @xmath115 $ ] . by assumptions on @xmath11",
    ", we next observe that no sign change of @xmath116 may occur , hence , @xmath116 is positive everywhere in @xmath117 $ ] and we have indeed @xmath118 hence also @xmath119 .",
    "after inverting the last identity we can integrate ( keeping in mind the boundary condition @xmath101 ) and find the desired representation formula @xmath120 for all @xmath115 $ ] . in turn , with the substitution @xmath121 , that is , @xmath122 , we obtain the following upper bound on  @xmath104 : @xmath123 this provides indeed a nontrivial upper bound , as can be seen by a case distinction between small and large values of  @xmath114 , in order to estimate the integral appearing on the right - hand side . in the case",
    "@xmath124 , we find by monotonicity of  @xmath125 @xmath126 while in the opposite case @xmath127 the change of variables with @xmath128 combined with   yields @xmath129 in conclusion , for all @xmath130 $ ] , we have derived the explicit upper bound @xmath131 which is a contradiction to @xmath102 for any given @xmath93 .",
    "thus , we have just proven that if   does not hold , then we can find a smooth domain  @xmath24 and smooth boundary values  @xmath3 such that all assumptions of theorem   are satisfied , and such that no lipschitz solution to problem   exists .",
    "more subtle non - existence results can be obtained , similarly as in the case of the minimal surface equation . in particular ,",
    "the class of regular domains which allow for non - existence results can be investigated .",
    "based on the previous construction and a comparison principle , one can in fact show that for every non - pseudoconvex regular domain  @xmath24 there exists smooth prescribed boundary values such that no lipschitz solution to the dirichlet problem   exists .",
    "in order to proceed to the proof of the second implication of theorem  [ t1 ] , we first derive some auxiliary algebraic inequalities .",
    "[ l1 ] let @xmath52 be a strictly convex function with @xmath53 which satisfies  ,   and  , and let @xmath132 be given by  . then , there hold @xmath133    we start by observing some simple consequences of the strict convexity of  @xmath11 .",
    "as  @xmath97 is monotonically increasing , assumption   gives @xmath134 which is the first inequality in  .",
    "we further observe that the assumptions @xmath53 and @xmath135 yield immediately @xmath136 for all @xmath137 , which implies the second inequality in  , and moreover , @xmath138 holds .",
    "due to the integrability of @xmath139 , we next deduce the identity @xmath140 and since by the bounded oscillation assumption in   we have in particular @xmath141 for all @xmath142 , also the claim   follows .",
    "finally , differentiating   we find @xmath143 and therefore , thanks to   and  , we obtain @xmath144 which is the last claim  .    secondly , we define the integrand for a comparison functional , which will be used later for the construction of appropriate barrier functions . to this end , we will essentially decrease the convexity for large values of the original integrand  @xmath11 ( note that the properties of the integrand for large values are the most crucial ones ) , which from a heuristic point of view will make it harder to construct solutions ( cp .  the calculations for annular domains in section  [ nonexistence ] ) .",
    "however , it turns out that as long as the fundamental condition   for the new integrand is satisfied , this construction is still possible , and it is precisely the weaker convexity for large values which will allow for the verification of the barrier condition .",
    "[ l2 ] let @xmath52 be a strictly convex function with @xmath53 which satisfies  ,   and  .",
    "then there exists a strictly positive , decreasing function @xmath145 with @xmath146 such that @xmath147 moreover , the function  @xmath148 defined via @xmath149 is strictly convex and satisfies @xmath150 and   , with possibly different constants  @xmath151 and  @xmath152 .",
    "we start by defining @xmath153 and we note that @xmath154 is a continuous , strictly decreasing function fulfilling @xmath155 as @xmath71 .",
    "next , we define @xmath156 and due to the properties of @xmath11 ( more precisely , @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) combined with @xmath159 , we observe @xmath160 $ ] . finally , we define @xmath161 and we now show that all statements of the lemma are indeed fulfilled with such a choice of  @xmath36 .",
    "let us start with  . by the definition of",
    "@xmath36 it directly follows that for any @xmath162 we have @xmath163 since @xmath139 and @xmath36 are positive and due to the assumption  , we have that @xmath164 hence ,   holds .",
    "next , we show the properties of the function  @xmath148 . by its definition",
    "we immediately obtain @xmath165 .",
    "moreover , we calculate its derivatives @xmath166 which shows the strict convexity and , via  , the validity of   for  @xmath148 . since by the definition of @xmath36 we have @xmath167 we find @xmath150 and @xmath168 ,",
    "thus also   is satisfied for  @xmath148 .",
    "finally , concerning  , we note that the linear growth assumption follows immediately from the properties of @xmath169 , while the oscillation assumption of @xmath11 carries directly over to  @xmath148 ( with constant @xmath170 instead of  @xmath152 ) .",
    "this concludes the proof of the lemma .",
    "we now prove the second ( and main ) implication of theorem  [ t1 ] . to this end",
    ", we perform an approximation procedure , and in what follows , we will prove uniform estimates for the minimizers for a proper choice of approximative problems .",
    "this is indeed sufficient to recover the claim with the passage to the limit since the strict convexity of our functional implies uniqueness of minimizers ( if it exists in the desired dirichlet class at all ) .",
    "thus , for arbitrary @xmath171 , we introduce the approximate functionals @xmath172 and look for minimizers @xmath173 in the dirichlet class @xmath60 , which is equivalent to looking for weak solutions to the following approximate dirichlet problem to   @xmath174 note that for the rest of the paper , we suppose , without explicit mentioning , that the function  @xmath11 satisfies  ,   and  , and that @xmath12 is related to @xmath11 via  .    due to the application of the direct method of the calculus of variations to the approximate functionals ( or the theory of monotone operators to the approximate dirichlet problems ) , we have the existence of a unique weak solution @xmath175 . in addition , in view of the regularity of the prescribed boundary values , we have @xmath176 for some @xmath177 , see e.g.  @xcite , and by difference quotient techniques ( and possibly after regularization of  @xmath11 via an @xmath178-mollifying kernel ) we also have @xmath179 .",
    "our main goal is to show that the following uniform estimate holds @xmath180 with some constant @xmath181 being independent of @xmath178 . indeed , having   in hands , we first find a subsequence converging weakly-@xmath22 to a function @xmath182 .",
    "then , when passing to the limit @xmath183 in the approximate functionals ( by lower semicontinuity ) or in the approximate dirichlet problems   ( by theory of monotone operators ) , the limit  @xmath184 turns out to be the desired solution .",
    "as is it actually lipschitz regular , theorem  [ t1 ] is therefore proven , provided that we can show that   holds .",
    "we first show that , in order to have  , it is actually sufficient to control the normal derivatives of the solutions  @xmath173 to the approximate problems uniformly on the boundary  @xmath50 . to this end , we start by deriving some standard uniform estimates and denote by @xmath185 an universal constant depending only on @xmath11 , @xmath3 and @xmath24 , but not on  @xmath178 . for simpler notation , we shall drop from now on the index  @xmath178 and write  @xmath186 instead of  @xmath173 . testing the weak formulation to   with the function @xmath187 , keeping in mind relation   and applying hlder s inequality ,",
    "we obtain @xmath188 hence , using young s inequality and  , we deduce @xmath189 similarly , testing   with the functions @xmath190 ( note that these functions are admissible since @xmath191 holds on @xmath50 ) , we get @xmath192 thus , it follows that @xmath193 to proceed further , we identify the equation for @xmath194 . applying @xmath195 to  ,",

    "in fact , since @xmath226 is a non - negative decreasing function and by using the cauchy - schwarz inequality , we see that the first and second expression in large brackets in the definition of  @xmath260 are non - negative .",

    ", we evaluate @xmath266 in this way the expression for  @xmath265 reduces to @xmath267 for @xmath262 , we then find , employing  , the oscillation assumption   on  @xmath11 and the fact that  @xmath36 is a positive and monotonically decreasing function , the inequalities @xmath268 and @xmath269 at this stage , we select a number @xmath270 depending only on  @xmath11 ,  @xmath36 and  @xmath239 such that @xmath271 holds which is possible because of @xmath272 as @xmath273 , according to lemma  [ l2 ] . with this choice and the integrability of  @xmath139 over  @xmath274 ( with integral equal to  @xmath275 ) ,",
    "we see easily that the expression in large brackets on the right - hand side of   is non - negative , whenever @xmath243 holds .",
    "consequently , using also the facts that @xmath226 is monotonically decreasing and that  @xmath12 is non - negative ( thanks to   and the non - negativity of  @xmath97 ) , we arrive at the implication @xmath276 combined with  , we finally conclude that  @xmath277 holds for all @xmath234 with @xmath243 , and the proof of the lemma is complete .",
    "the strategy of proof is as follows : by adjusting the true barrier function from lemma  [ l4 ] to our needs , we construct in a first step a _ local upper barrier function _ relative to the dirichlet problem   for an arbitrary given boundary point  @xmath82 .",
    "this means that we specify a relative neighborhood  @xmath278 of  @xmath82 in  @xmath24 and a local lipschitz continuous function  @xmath279 ( which will be an affine perturbation of the function from lemma  [ l4 ] ) defined on  @xmath278 such that    1 .",

    ", we can finally estimate the normal derivative of  @xmath186 at  @xmath82 by the sup - norm of the derivative of the barrier function  @xmath279 ( which in turn is bounded in terms of the data ) and arrive at the assertion  .",
    "now we start with the derivation of the estimates for the normal derivative .",
    "since @xmath24 is by assumption of class  @xmath56 and satisfies an exterior ball condition , we find positive constants @xmath284 , @xmath285 , @xmath286 and  @xmath287 depending only on  @xmath24 such that we can suppose that an arbitrary boundary point @xmath288 is given , after an orthogonal transformation , by @xmath289 ( we use the notation @xmath290 ) and that we have the inclusions @xmath291 with a function @xmath292 fulfilling @xmath293 , @xmath294 and @xmath295 for all @xmath296 .",
    "in addition , we may suppose that  @xmath284 is so small that @xmath297 holds and that @xmath298 is satisfied for all @xmath299 , for some constant  @xmath300 depending only on  @xmath24 and  @xmath284 ( this can for example be seen easily if also @xmath301 holds ) .    in this setting , for an arbitrary @xmath302 ( to be specified later on )",
    "we can work with the functions  @xmath226 and  @xmath220 introduced in   and  , and with the function  @xmath236 from   for the specific choices @xmath303 and @xmath304 , that is , with @xmath305 note that @xmath236 is well defined outside the ball @xmath306 and so it is well - defined also in @xmath307 .",
    "in addition , it is clear that @xmath308 holds , hence , we can choose @xmath309 and fix the number  @xmath310 ( depending only on  @xmath11 and this",
    "@xmath239 ) according to lemma  [ l4 ] .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath311 maps @xmath213 to @xmath212 and is monotonically increasing , we can fix a number @xmath312 such that @xmath313 from now on , we will consider arbitrary @xmath314 .",
    "then , from   and   it follows that @xmath315 consequently , using lemma  [ l4 ] , we see that @xmath236 is a super - solution to   in the set @xmath316 , which is the first crucial property of an upper barrier .",
    "next , we want to identify a part of @xmath317 on which @xmath318 holds , that is , where @xmath319 from taylor expansion of  @xmath3 and the  @xmath68-regularity assumption on  @xmath3 we know that @xmath320 so to verify   it is enough to check where @xmath321 holds .",
    "using the definitions of @xmath226 in   and of  @xmath220 in  , combined with the fact that  @xmath311 is monotonically increasing , we have for all @xmath322 @xmath323 consequently , in order to guarantee   and thus   it is sufficient , in view of  , to have @xmath324 which is indeed true for all  @xmath81 with @xmath325 , by the choices of the parameter  @xmath326 in   and of the radius  @xmath327 in  .",
    "thus , we have verified @xmath328    finally , in order to complete the second property of the barrier function that it lies above the solution on all of the boundary of a relative neighborhood of  @xmath82 , we still need to take care of the values of @xmath329 inside of @xmath24 ( but close to  @xmath82 ) .",
    "this shall now be accomplished by a suitable choices of a local neighborhood and of  @xmath314 .",
    "first , since  @xmath284 and @xmath327 are already fixed ( in dependence on  @xmath24 ,  @xmath11 and  @xmath3 ) , we can zoom in the neighborhood of  @xmath82 and find  @xmath330 and @xmath331 sufficiently small ( depending again only on data ) such that @xmath332 by these choices , due to   and  , @xmath236 is a super - solution to   in the relative neighborhood  @xmath333 of  @xmath82 and satisfies @xmath334 on  @xmath335 , for all @xmath336 .",
    "our goal is to show @xmath337 on the remaining part of @xmath338 , and this is indeed the point , where we shall use the assumption  .    in view of the choice of  @xmath284 and  @xmath339 there exists",
    "@xmath340 independent of @xmath341 such that for all @xmath342 there holds @xmath343 hence , from the definition of  @xmath236 in   and of  @xmath220 in   we find @xmath344 on the other hand , we know @xmath345 from  . therefore , in order to show that @xmath346 on @xmath338 , it is enough to verify that we can choose @xmath347 in such way that @xmath348 using the definition of  @xmath226 in   and the substitution formula , we deduce that @xmath349 if we now introduce @xmath350 ( depending only on  @xmath24 , as  @xmath284 and  @xmath351 are already fixed ) , the above integral can be estimated by @xmath352 ( note that the integral on the right - hand side is negative whenever @xmath353 holds , hence , the previous inequality is trivially satisfied in this case ) .",
    "thanks to lemma  [ l2 ] ( more precisely , by   and   for  @xmath148 ) , we know first that @xmath354 as @xmath355 and secondly that @xmath356 therefore , we can fix @xmath357 ( depending only on  @xmath24 ,  @xmath11 and @xmath3 ) such that @xmath358 holds , which yields the desired inequality  .",
    "therefore , we have proved @xmath359 and have finished the construction of the barrier function on the relative neighborhood  @xmath307 of  @xmath82 .",
    "it now remains to establish the bound   for the normal derivative of  @xmath186 , locally at  @xmath82 .",
    "for this purpose , we recall that  @xmath236 is a super - solution to   and @xmath186 is a solution to   in @xmath339 , thus , in view of   we obtain from the comparison principle for elliptic equations in divergence form @xmath360 this now allows to estimate the normal derivative .",
    "indeed , for any @xmath361 we have @xmath362 , and therefore , taking into account also @xmath363 , we find the following estimate @xmath364 thus , recalling that the outer unit normal to  @xmath50 in  @xmath82 is given by @xmath365 , we obtain in the passage @xmath366 the lower bound @xmath367 repeating the whole procedure with  @xmath220 replaced by  @xmath368 , we get the opposite inequality @xmath369 the latter two inequalities imply  , which in turn , due to subsection  [ ss31 ] , provides @xmath370 ( which , as the index  @xmath178 was dropped , is precisely the uniform bound  ) .",
