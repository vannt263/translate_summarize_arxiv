    "the centre of the milky way galaxy is located at the position of the radio source sgr a * , and contains a supermassive black hole with a mass now measured to be @xmath11  m@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the galactic centre  at a distance of only 8.4 kpc @xcite  allows an unprecedented opportunity to study in detail the complex physics that occurs in the environments around supermassive black holes .",
    "the recent discovery of tev @xmath0-raysemanating from a region only @xmath13  pc from sgr a*@xcite is an excellent example of the numerous physical puzzles presented by the galactic centre .",
    "although the centroid of the galactic centre tev source is located only @xmath14 from sgr a *  @xcite , the origin of the tev photons is not understood .",
    "there are two main pathways to produce tev @xmath0-rays : the first is a hadronic process where protons with tev energies scatter off lower energy protons producing pions ( @xmath15 ) , with the @xmath16s quickly decaying into two @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "the energetics of the collisions generally produce @xmath0-rayswith energies @xmath17 less than the incident tev proton .",
    "the second mechanism is via inverse compton scattering of uv photons off of tev electrons .",
    "both mechanisms require a powerful particle accelerator to produce the high - energy particle population .",
    "unfortunately , the region around sgr a *  contains several such accelerators , including a supernova remnant @xcite , a pulsar wind nebula @xcite , and sgr a *  itself @xcite .",
    "the centroid of the tev source has now been measured with sufficient accuracy to exclude the sgr a east supernova remnant as the source of the emission @xcite ; however , the pulsar and the black hole remain plausible sources of the high - energy particles responsible for the tev emission .",
    "the temporal relationship between particle acceleration and tev emission is one way to discriminate between the various origins of the high - energy particles .",
    "sgr a *  has recently exhibited flares on timescales as short as minutes at both x - ray and near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this timescale indicates the flaring region must be extremely close to the black hole event horizon , one of the possible sites of particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "thus , the expectation is if sgr a *  is the origin of the tev particles , the tev @xmath0-rays  should be variable , and possibly be coincident with the flares observed at lower energies . however , no variability of the tev source has ever been observed on timescales ranging from 30 minutes to years @xcite .",
    "moreover , during a coordinated monitoring campaign with _",
    "chandra _ , the h.e.s.s.instrument did not detect any increase in tev @xmath0-ray emission during a x - ray flare @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-rays  are unlikely to be produced in the same region as the relativistic x - ray emitting electrons ( i.e. , within @xmath7  schwarzschild radii of the black hole ) . this fact must be explained by any model for the tev  @xmath0-rays , and seems to support the scenario where the @xmath0-rays  are associated with electrons accelerated by the pulsar wind nebula .",
    "however , protons may be accelerated close to the black hole , but be converted to @xmath0-rays  only after travelling a significant distance away from the acceleration region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the scenario presented by @xcite proton acceleration was assumed to occur at distances of only @xmath18@xmath19 schwarzschild radii from the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the particles would then diffuse away from sgr a *  through the magnetised turbulent ism , until possibly colliding with the dense molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ; e.g. , @xcite ) at a distance of @xmath20@xmath21  pc .",
    "@xcite modelled this process in detail , paying close attention to the propagation of the high - energy protons , and obtained a good fit to the observed tev spectrum .",
    "a key finding of this calculation was the strong energy dependence of the proton interaction with the cnd ( the site of the @xmath0-ray production ) .",
    "only @xmath22% of the 100  tev protons interacted with the cnd to produce @xmath0-rays , with this rising to @xmath23% at 10  tev and @xmath24% at 1 tev .",
    "the higher energy protons scattered far fewer times in the ism than the low energy ones and therefore were less likely to encounter the cnd and produce @xmath0-rays .",
    "thus , a high energy roll - over in the tev spectrum at energies @xmath3  tev is a generic prediction of the hadronic model , and a relatively flat proton spectrum is required to compensate for the low interaction rate between the high energy protons and the cnd .",
    "@xcite only considered the steady - state @xmath0-ray flux and spectrum , but it is clear that the significant energy and geometric dependence of the diffusion and scattering processes will lead to an interesting time dependence of the @xmath0-ray flux if there is some change at the acceleration site .",
    "it is clearly important to quantify the spectral and time dependence of the expected tev signal to allow testing of the hadronic model with the continued @xmath0-ray monitoring of sgr a*. in addition , the time evolution of the @xmath0-ray spectrum may be relevant to the recent fe  k@xmath25  line maps of the galactic centre environment which indicate that sgr a *  was more luminous @xmath26  years ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations raises the possibility that the current observed tev emission is related to an earlier , more active state of the black hole and not its current state .",
    "this paper makes use of the proton transport calculations performed by @xcite to investigate the time and energy dependence of the tev @xmath0-ray emission in the scenario where the protons are accelerated very close to the black hole .",
    "we will quantify the variability timescale expected for the tev emission in this model and explore the possibility that the current tev flux is related to an earlier outburst of sgr a*. the next section details how the time dependence of the tev flux was computed .",
    "section  [ sect : res ] presents the results , while section  [ sect : discuss ] contains our discussion and conclusions .",
    "@xcite calculated over 220,000 proton trajectories in a 6  pc@xmath276  pc@xmath286  pc cube consisting of @xmath29 equally spaced cells centred on the galactic centre .",
    "details of the computations of the proton transport and @xmath0-ray production can be found in that paper .",
    "the @xmath0-rays  are produced from clumps of high density ( @xmath30  @xmath31 ) gas in a model cnd that has an inner radius of 1.2  pc from sgr a *  and a thickness of 1  pc .",
    "the spectrum of protons that escapes the acceleration region at sgr a *  is a power - law with index @xmath25 ( i.e. , the injected proton spectrum is @xmath32 , where @xmath33  tev ) .",
    "the steady - state calculation of @xcite found a good fit to the h.e.s.s .",
    "tev data with @xmath5 , a much flatter spectrum than is expected from traditional particle acceleration mechanisms ( where @xmath34@xmath35 ) .",
    "we compute @xmath0-ray flux ( in ph  m@xmath36  s@xmath37  tev@xmath37 ) at 31 logarithmically spaced energies : @xmath38 .",
    "the time step used in the proton transport computations varied between a small fraction of a year for the lowest energy particles to just over a year for protons with energies close to 100  tev .",
    "thus , variations in the tev spectrum and flux can only be calculated for timescales greater than @xmath39  yr . the time dependence of the @xmath0-ray flux will be investigated in two ways .",
    "first , the particle accelerator located at the origin is assumed to turn on at @xmath40 and remain on at a constant rate .",
    "all proton trajectories are followed for an observed time @xmath41 , and the optical depth to scattering with cnd gas during this time is recorded . after a complete census of the optical depth to proton - proton scattering in the dense gas is determined , the total @xmath0-ray flux in multiple energy bands is then calculated .",
    "the limiting time @xmath41 is increased until the fluxes reach the observed values determined by the steady - state model .",
    "a second calculation is performed to investigate the response of the tev flux to a burst of particle acceleration lasting @xmath42 years .",
    "the proton trajectories are followed and the @xmath0-ray flux calculated in the time interval ( @xmath41,@xmath43 ) with @xmath41 increasing from @xmath44 to @xmath45  yrs in steps of @xmath46  yrs .",
    "this computation is performed for bursts of activity lasting @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath19 , @xmath49 and @xmath50  yrs .",
    "this experiment will help determine if the current observed tev source may have been caused by an earlier period of activity around sgr a*.",
    "figure  [ fig : fratio1 ] plots the @xmath0-ray flux as a function of time in three different tev energy bands .",
    "this figure shows the fluxes as fractions of the observed h.e.s.s .",
    "values as determined by the steady - state model @xcite .",
    "the lorentz force of the magnetic field on a proton is proportional to @xmath51 , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the proton , so high energy protons spend less time random walking around the interstellar medium and reach the dense gas much more rapidly than the lower energy particles .",
    "therefore , it only takes @xmath2  yrs for the @xmath48@xmath49  tev flux to reach a significant fraction of its steady - state value .",
    "the lower energy protons take much longer to diffuse outwards . indeed , after the particle accelerator has been operating for @xmath48  yrs the @xmath52@xmath20  tev flux has reached only @xmath13% of its final value .",
    "the accelerator must run for over @xmath4 years shorter than the estimated lifetime of the cnd @xcite ; thus , these timescales are not effected by the static gas model for the cnd and surrounding ism . ] for enough protons to interact with the molecular gas to account for the observed h.e.s.s .",
    "the normalisation of the injected proton spectrum was chosen so that these equilibrium fluxes would match the observed values . if a higher normalisation was chosen ( i.e. , the proton luminosity produced by the sgr a *  accelerator was higher ) then the timescales for the fluxes to match the observed values would be shorter , but the steady - state fluxes would be greater than what is observed , violating the initial assumption of our scenario ( that the observed tev source is due to an accelerator has been operating at a constant level for a long time ) .    after the accelerator has been operating for about 3  yrs ,",
    "the first protons start interacting with the cnd and produce tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : slopevstime ] , the tev spectrum produced at this time would be hard with a @xmath53@xmath19  tev photon index @xmath54 ( where photon flux @xmath55 ) , as only a small fraction of the low energy protons would be on fortuitous trajectories to interact with the high density gas at this early stage .",
    "the spectrum softens steadily over the next @xmath4 years as the lower energy protons reach the cnd and produce @xmath0-rays .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from this experiment .",
    "first , if there is a proton accelerator close to sgr a *  and it either switches on or increases its acceleration rate ( i.e. , a flare of protons ) , the resulting @xmath0-rays  will not be detected for @xmath2  yrs and only in the very high energy @xmath48@xmath49  tev band . it will take over a century for the flare to be seen in @xmath20@xmath48  tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "therefore , the null result found in the coordinated x - ray / tev monitoring of sgr a *  @xcite indicates that the x - ray and tev photons are being produced in different regions , but does not rule out that sgr a *  is ultimately responsible for the proton acceleration .",
    "these results show that time variability of the tev source is likely to be observed only in the @xmath48@xmath49  tev band and on decade - like timescales .",
    "if such variability was observed , however , it would give strong support to a high - energy diffusion process producing the @xmath0-rays  and thus the hadronic and sgr a *  model for the tev emission .",
    "on the other hand , if no variability of the tev source is ever detected , it still will not rule out sgr a *  as the site of particle acceleration , but it will imply that this accelerator must be operating at a relatively constant rate for @xmath56 yrs .      in the hadronic model for the tev source , the @xmath0-rays  are produced from protons that have diffused outwards from the acceleration site close to sgr a*. the previous section showed that this diffusion can cause a significant delay between when the protons were accelerated and when they produce @xmath0-rays . given the evidence that points to a more luminous black hole at the galactic centre @xmath57  yrs ago , it is interesting to consider the possibility that the current observed @xmath0-ray source was caused by this earlier activity . unfortunately , figure  [ fig : twoplot ] rules out this possibility .",
    "the rapid diffusion of the @xmath58  tev protons causes the resulting @xmath0-ray spectrum to soften rapidly .",
    "as discussed above , the highest energy protons scatter off the cnd and produce high energy @xmath0-rays  only @xmath2  yrs after being injected into the interstellar gas . increasing the duration of the burst of particle acceleration",
    "does not improve this situation as long as the observations are being made following the end of the burst .",
    "this is because it is only the protons that were injected within the last decade that produce the high energy @xmath3  tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "[ fig : twoplot ] shows the results for an injected proton spectrum with @xmath5 .",
    "the same calculations were also performed with more traditional values of @xmath59 and @xmath35 , but , as the diffusion properties of the protons are independent of @xmath25 , the conclusion is unchanged : if the observed tev signal is related to accretion onto sgr a * , it can not be caused by a burst of protons produced @xmath57  years ago during the period of greater x - ray luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : twoplot ] indicates that the tev spectrum may have the right shape @xmath2@xmath60  years after a burst ; however , comparing these spectra to the h.e.s.s .",
    "data illustrates another feature of the proton diffusion in the galactic centre .",
    "figure  [ fig : spect1 ] plots the tev spectrum produced at 10 , 50 and 100  yrs following a 100 year - long burst of proton acceleration at the galactic centre .",
    "this figure shows that at energies less than 1  tev , all three spectra retain the hard shape of the injected proton spectrum , in marked contrast to the observed spectrum at those energies .",
    "thus , even though the average spectral slope 10 years after the burst is close to the observed value , the actual shape of the spectrum does not describe the data .",
    "the reason for this very hard spectrum at @xmath61  tev is that the low energy protons take a very long time to diffuse outward to the cnd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fratio1 ] ) .",
    "the low energy @xmath0-rays  that make up the plotted spectra are made up from very few interactions of protons and dense clouds . as time passes ,",
    "more of these interactions occur and , since a very high percentage of the low energy protons interact with the molecular gas , the @xmath52@xmath20  tev spectrum rises steadily .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fratio1 ] , it will take several thousand years before the majority of injected low energy protons have interacted with the cnd .",
    "therefore , the burst scenario with @xmath5 leaves us with a catch-22 situation : the high energy @xmath0-ray spectrum can only be matched @xmath2  yrs after the burst , but the low energy tev spectrum will not have the right shape for several thousand years after the burst .    these results lead to an interesting possibility : as the low energy tev spectrum closely follows the injection spectrum after a burst of protons , is it possible to fit all of the h.e.s.s .",
    "data with a softer proton injection spectrum ?",
    "this would only work for burst durations @xmath62  yrs so that high energy @xmath0-rays  would make up a significant fraction of all the proton interactions .",
    "we searched for such a solution using @xmath63 fitting to the observed h.e.s.s .",
    "all model spectra were normalised to a flux of @xmath64  m@xmath36  s@xmath37  tev at 1  tev with @xmath25 and the time since the end of the burst being free parameters .",
    "with @xmath65  yrs we found a good fit ( @xmath66d.o.f.@xmath67 , where d.o.f.@xmath68 degrees of freedom ) at @xmath69  yrs after the burst and @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spect2 ] . a similar fit ( @xmath66d.o.f.@xmath70 )",
    "was found for @xmath47  yrs with @xmath8 , but now observed 10  yrs after the end of the burst .",
    "these spectra are not as good a fit to the data as the steady - state model , but they have the advantage of a softer proton spectrum that is more consistent with particle acceleration processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the observed @xmath0-ray flux and the calculated energy - dependent proton interaction rate allows the calculation of the @xmath20@xmath71  tev energy in protons produced by sgr a*in this model .",
    "we find this energy to be @xmath72  ergs and @xmath73  ergs for the @xmath65 and @xmath74  yrs fit , respectively . assuming a constant proton production rate during the burst , this results in proton luminosities of @xmath75  erg  s@xmath37 and @xmath76  erg  s@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we will consider the viability of these fits in the next section .",
    "this paper has considered the time dependence of the galactic centre tev source under the scenario that the @xmath0-rays  originate from protons that were accelerated close to the black hole located at sgr a*. first , we computed the time evolution of the tev source following the ignition of a long - lived accelerator .",
    "this experiment will also be applicable to the situation where a flare or a burst of proton acceleration occurred at some point during the accelerator s lifetime .",
    "we find that , as a result of the energy dependent diffusion rate of the protons , the shortest timescale for variability is @xmath2  yrs and occurs only for @xmath3  tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "detection of this energy dependent variability would be compelling evidence for the hadronic model and an acceleration site close to sgr a*. if the tev source is a result of a long - lived accelerator than it must have been operating for at least @xmath4  yrs to build up the large @xmath52@xmath20  tev flux .",
    "however , because of the strong energy dependent interaction rate of the protons with the molecular gas , the injected proton spectrum must be very hard with @xmath5 .",
    "we also considered the possibility that the accelerator was not long - lived and that the observed @xmath0-rays  are a result of a recent burst of particle acceleration that has since ended .",
    "this model seemed particularly interesting in light of the recent results from fe  k@xmath25reverberation indicating that sgr a *  was more luminous @xmath57  yrs ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we are able to definitively rule out this possibility , as there is no way that a burst of protons of any duration or spectral index can reproduce the observed photon index over 100  yrs after the end of the burst .",
    "this is because the highest energy protons produce their @xmath0-rays  within @xmath48  yrs of being released into the interstellar medium .",
    "moreover , if @xmath5 it would take several thousand years after the end of the burst to reproduce the shape of the low energy h.e.s.s . spectrum .",
    "considerations of how the tev spectrum evolved with time allowed the discovery of new solution to the observed h.e.s.s .",
    "spectrum , now with @xmath8 .",
    "this new model implies the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations were made @xmath2  yrs after a burst lasting @xmath74@xmath48  yrs .",
    "this model has the immediate advantage that the proton spectral index is easily accounted for by particle acceleration processes , but implies a more random and variable acceleration region",
    ". this would not be unexpected given the observed variability ( on much shorter timescales ) seen from sgr a *  in x - ray wavelengths .",
    "it should be emphasised that burst durations shorter than 3  yrs and ( slightly ) longer than 10  yrs would still be able to fit the h.e.s.s .",
    "the only differences from the above result would be in the delay between the end of the burst and the observation time , and in the proton luminosity produced by the accelerator ( a higher luminosity would be needed for a shorter @xmath77 ) . a key prediction of this scenario",
    "is that the spectrum will soften noticeably over the next @xmath22  yrs as the high energy @xmath0-raysdisappear .",
    "of course , further short bursts of protons could continue to energise this region of the spectrum . in that case",
    ", some spectral variability in the high - energy region of the spectrum might be observed on @xmath9few year long timescales as the spectral index of the protons would be unlikely to be identical during each outburst .",
    "the fits for the burst scenario imply a proton luminosity of @xmath78  erg  s@xmath37 .",
    "this is within an order of magnitude of the proton luminosity originally calculated by @xcite in their first application of stochastic acceleration of protons to the tev source .",
    "it is interesting to compare this power in protons to the radiative output of sgr a*. the observed bolometric luminosity of sgr a *  is @xmath79  erg  s@xmath37 , resulting in an eddington ratio of @xmath80 .",
    "the gas density and temperature has been measured at the bondi radius @xcite , and the resulting bondi accretion rate is @xmath81  m@xmath12  yr@xmath37 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to account for",
    "the observed luminosity of sgr a *  this flow must have an extremely small radiative inefficiency of @xmath82 .",
    "accretion models have only been able to explain this very low efficiency by reducing the actual accretion rate onto the black hole by @xmath83 via strong outflows ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "these low accretion rates seem to be consistent with those derived from sub - millimetre polarisation measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although care is needed in the interpretation of those data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the tev source is generated by brief bursts of particle acceleration in the accretion flow , then this could be another mechanism of reducing the radiative efficiency of weakly accreting black holes .",
    "there already exists compelling evidence that at very low inflow rates the liberated accretion energy can be efficiently converted into particle acceleration .",
    "for example , the presence of jets is much more common in low - luminosity agns than in other , more luminous accreting black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , accreting stellar mass black holes are observed to preferentially produce jets at low eddington ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". at even smaller accretion rates ( but very high black hole mass ) , there seems to be an efficient conversion of accretion power into jet power @xcite . the radio and sub - millimetre emission from sgr a *",
    "can also be described as originating from a mildly relativistic jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the tev source from the galactic centre could be another indication that weakly accreting black holes are important sites of particle acceleration , where , in this case , the efficiency of conversion into proton power would be @xmath84 .",
    "in our exploration of the time - dependence of the @xmath0-ray signal from the galactic centre , we have found two potential explanations for the source .",
    "the first requires a long - lived particle accelerator , lasting at least @xmath4  yrs , and a very hard proton injection spectrum of @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath4  yrs timescale is the minimum required for protons to diffuse throughout the galactic ridge and contribute to the observed tev glow of the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the interaction of the @xmath5 proton spectrum with the stellar wind gas in the galactic centre naturally accounted for the observed ghz radio emission from that region .",
    "the proton luminosity required from this particle accelerator would be @xmath85  erg  s@xmath37 and would indicate that particle acceleration would not be an important energetic component of the accretion flow , perhaps consistent with the small fraction of non - thermal electrons needed to fit the sgr a*spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rapid burst scenario reproduces the observed spectrum with a more typical proton spectrum of @xmath8 , but requires the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations to have been made at specific times after the bursts . if the bursts of particle acceleration are reasonably frequent , however , then this problem is not too constraining .",
    "perhaps the cleanest discrimination between the two scenarios is that a much higher degree of spectral variability would be expected in high energy @xmath0-rays  in the burst model than for the long - lived accelerator . in the former case ,",
    "the high energy spectrum should soften dramatically over the next few years unless additional bursts have re - energised the high energy particles .",
    "the long - lived accelerator would be expected to only show moderate variability in response to changes in the acceleration rate and , at high energies , this would be at decade - like timescales .",
    "if any spectral variability of the tev spectrum is observed , then this would be strong support for the hadronic model . to conclude",
    ", we recommend that spectral monitoring of the galactic centre tev source should be performed on an annual basis to search for spectral variability , with particular emphasis in searching for changes in the @xmath58  tev spectrum .",
    "improving the quality of the observations at @xmath58  tev will be extremely important in determining the mechanism behind the tev source .",

    "<S> the physical mechanism behind the tev @xmath0-ray source observed at the centre of the galaxy is still unknown . </S>",
    "<S> one intriguing possibility is that the accretion flow onto the central supermassive black hole is responsible for accelerating protons to tev energies which then diffuse outward to interact with molecular gas at distances of @xmath1  pc . here </S>",
    "<S> , we build on our earlier detailed calculations of the proton transport to consider the time and energy dependence of the tev signal following a burst of particle acceleration at sgr a*. we find that , due to the strong energy dependence of the proton diffusion , any variability in the particle acceleration rate will only be visible in the tev signal after a delay of @xmath2  yrs , and only at energies @xmath3  tev . if the accelerator is long - lived it must have been running for at least @xmath4  yrs and have a hard proton injection spectrum of @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) in order to produce the correct amount of high energy @xmath0-ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> this rapid diffusion of high energy protons also rules out the possibility that the observed tev source is directly related to the period of increased activity of sgr a *  that ended @xmath7  yrs ago . </S>",
    "<S> however , a good fit to the observed h.e.s.s . </S>",
    "<S> data was found with @xmath8 for the scenario of a brief ( @xmath9few year long ) burst of particle acceleration that occurred @xmath2  yrs ago . </S>",
    "<S> if such bursts are common then they will keep the tev source energised and will likely produce spectral variability at @xmath3  tev on @xmath10  yr timescales . </S>",
    "<S> this model also implies that particle acceleration may be an important mechanism in reducing the radiative efficiency of weakly accreting black holes .    </S>",
