    "is required .",
    "at the earth , photons initiate almost purely electromagnetic showers via pair production and bremsstrahlung .",
    "additional processes are important at highest energy .      * preshower effect . * contrary to nuclear primaries , @xmath110@xmath12  ev photons can convert in the geomagnetic field to an @xmath8 pair which then emits synchrotron photons.@xcite instead of a single uhe photon , a bunch of lower - energy electromagnetic particles , called `` preshower '' , enters the atmosphere with important consequences for the shower development .",
    "the local differential probability of photon conversion as well as the probability distribution of synchrotron photons emitted by the electrons , depend on the parameter @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy of the parent particle ( photon or electron ) , @xmath15 the electron mass , @xmath16 a constant , and @xmath17 is the local magnetic field component transverse to the direction of the particle s motion .",
    "since @xmath17 is involved , preshower characteristics depend strongly on the specific trajectory through the magnetosphere and , thus , on the arrival direction and the experimental site ( see figure  [ fig - conv ] ) .",
    "the probability @xmath18 of a photon to convert in the earth s magnetic field results from an integration along the particle trajectory ; for @xmath19 , photons would almost surely undergo geomagnetic cascading .",
    "non - negligible probabilities ( @xmath20 10% ) are usually obtained if values @xmath21 are reached along the trajectory , corresponding to photon energies above 24 @xmath22 @xmath9  ev depending on the site .",
    "the energy partition in the produced @xmath8 pair is usually symmetric ( ratio of energies @xmath232 ) , with the probability of asymmetric share increasing with @xmath24.@xcite the spectrum of synchrotron photons becomes harder for larger values of @xmath24 .",
    "secondary photons of sufficiently high energy can convert again .",
    "a typical preshower from a 10@xmath12  ev photon starts at @xmath11000  km altitude and enters the atmosphere ( @xmath1100  km altitude ) with one or a few @xmath8 pairs around 10@xmath25  ev and a large number ( @xmath1500 ) of photons .",
    "the photon energies extend over several decades , with a few photons around 10@xmath26  ev .",
    "significant fluctuations around these averages may occur , particularly when the conversion takes place at low altitudes .",

    "the lpm effect delays the development of an air shower initiated by a single uhe photon as those processes are suppressed that degrade the energy carried by individual high - energy particles .",
    "fluctuations can be very large due to a positive correlation of the reduction of @xmath29 since @xmath42 for depths @xmath43@xmath6@xmath44 .",

    "is expected to be @xmath110  mb at @xmath9  ev and thus more than two orders of magnitude below @xmath46 ( which , however , can be reduced by the lpm effect ) .",
    "one important consequence is that our lack of knowledge of hadron dynamics at high - energy @xmath4 a major limitation for conclusions about the nuclear composition  @xmath4 is of much smaller impact when calculating photon showers .",
    "for instance , depths of shower maxima differ by 30@xmath440 g  @xmath35 between sibyll@xcite and qgsjet@xcite for uhe protons ( see section  [ sub - feat ] , figure  [ fig - xmaxvse ] ) but by less than @xmath1  5  g  @xmath35 for uhe photons@xcite . for photon searches , data can be compared to photon simulations only , without subtracting a background from nuclear primaries .    as another consequence , certain photon shower observables , in particular the number of secondary muons , are sensitive to uhe extrapolations of the photonuclear cross - section .",
    "different extrapolations of the photon - proton cross - section exist in the literature , see e.g. refs.@xcite for compilations . for uhe photon searches ,",
    "it is important to know whether the cross - section could grossly exceed an extrapolation such as provided by the particle data group ( pdg),@xcite since larger values mean photon showers were actually more similar to those of nuclear primaries ; an absence of uhe photons may then erroneously be concluded from data .",
    "using a dipole formalism and taking unitarity constraints into account , values of the uhe cross - section that exceed the pdg extrapolation by more than @xmath180% ( less at smaller energy ) were found to be disfavored.@xcite it should be noted that for shower simulations , finally the photon-_air _ cross - section is needed , which requires an account for nuclear effects ( see e.g.  ref.@xcite ) . from simulations with modified cross - sections , uncertainties for photon showers of @xmath110  g  @xmath35 in @xmath47 ( depth of shower maximum ) and @xmath115% in @xmath48 ( number of muons at ground )",

    "such a scenario can be distinguished from more `` standard '' ones .",
    "shower profiles calculated with the preshower and lpm effects switched on / off are shown in figure  [ fig - profiles ] for the conditions of the @xmath49 fly s eye event@xcite .",
    "both effects compete with each other : the lpm effect increases the average @xmath47 and its event - by - event fluctuations . the preshower effect , in turn , reduces both quantities .    calculations of average @xmath47 values for different primaries are shown in figure  [ fig - xmaxvse ] . the large `` elongation rate '' ( slope @xmath50 ) for photons leads to @xmath47 values well above those of nuclear primaries already at @xmath51@xmath4@xmath0  ev .",
    "changes in the elongation rate at @xmath9@xmath4@xmath3  ev are due to the lpm and preshower effects .",
    "in addition to @xmath47 , showers from photon and nuclear primaries differ in @xmath52 due to the small photonuclear cross - section . to study the impact of shower fluctuations on photon identification , a scatter plot of @xmath47 versus @xmath52 is given in figure  [ fig - xmaxnmu ] for different primaries simulated at @xmath53  ev .",
    "this is an idealized plot as no detector effects are accounted for .",
    "it can be seen that shower fluctuations by themselves do not impose major limitations to identify photons .",
    "misidentification rates of @xmath23@xmath54 ( @xmath23@xmath55 ) using @xmath47 ( @xmath52 ) seem possible for protons and are even smaller for nuclei ( numbers may depend on the hadron generator used for calculating nuclear primaries ) . in turn",
    ", an unconverted primary photon may hardly be distinguished from a nuclear primary if in one of the first interactions , a photonuclear interaction occurs ( probability of order @xmath11% ) .",
    "contrary to @xmath47 , @xmath52 does not differ much between converted and unconverted photons.@xcite further studies of photon showers can be found , for instance , in refs.@xcite .",
    "there are other observables , usually closely related to @xmath47 or @xmath52 or a combination of both , that could be used to distinguish photons from nuclear primaries .",
    "these observables , some of which are specific for a certain detector type and experimental configuration , include the curvature of the shower front and the steepness of the lateral distribution@xcite of ground particles , the risetime@xcite of the detector signal at a certain core distance as well as the signal amplitude by itself",
    ".      the differences between showers from photons and nuclear primaries can affect the detector acceptance to and the energy reconstruction of uhe photons .",
    "as the effects depend on the detector type , analysis approaches appropriate for the experimental apparatus can be developed to minimize uncertainties from the corrections .",
    "suppose a two - component composition of photons and protons with fluxes @xmath56 and @xmath57 at energy @xmath14 .",
    "the ratio of photons to protons , one measure of the photon fraction , is then @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , integral fluxes or fractions , additional primaries , or the photon fraction to the total flux could be considered .",
    "regarding the detector acceptances @xmath59 with @xmath60 or @xmath61 , an acceptance ratio of @xmath62 affects both the flux and fraction of registered photons .",
    "such a bias can occur for near - vertical photon showers reaching ground before being fully developed .",
    "for instance , the aperture of the hires - i telescope was found to be @xmath140% reduced for photons at @xmath11.@xcite in a recent analysis of auger hybrid data , a minimum zenith angle was introduced to reduce the acceptance bias to photons.@xcite experimental conclusions about the photon _ flux _ require knowledge of @xmath63 ( usually well controlled for arrays using appropriate selection cuts ) .",
    "for conclusions about the photon _ fraction _ , knowledge of the relative acceptance @xmath64 ( possibly easier to calculate for fluorescence telescopes ) may be sufficient .",
    "the latter approach has been applied in the analysis of auger hybrid data.@xcite    reconstructing an energy @xmath65 from observables that , on average , differ between photon and proton showers of same energy @xmath14 and assuming proton primaries only , leads to a misreconstruction of photon energies . selecting events according to @xmath65 then introduces a shift in energy scales between the primaries : events with the same @xmath65 refer to protons of energy @xmath66 , but to photons of energy @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the photon flux and fraction actually entering the data sample are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in general , a correction for this shift in energy scales is required .    for the fluorescence technique using the integrated calorimetric shower energy as an observable , @xmath71 ,",
    "i.e. the energy scales nearly match and @xmath72 .",
    "the small difference in energy scales is due to the missing energy correction , which is larger for nuclear primaries compared to the almost purely electromagnetic photon showers.@xcite a conservative upper limit to the _ integral _ flux or fraction of photons above @xmath14 may then be possible _ without _ correction or assumptions on @xmath56 since for @xmath73 .",
    "this was used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for arrays when reconstructing the energy from a signal amplitude @xmath74 measured at ground at core distance @xmath75 , the factor @xmath76 depends in general on the arrival direction of the event ( slant depth to ground changes with zenith , preshower probability depends on zenith and azimuth ) , its energy ( dependence of @xmath47 with energy , see figure [ fig - xmaxvse ] ) , and detector characteristics ( e.g. sensitivity to shower muons ) .",
    "values of @xmath77 are possible.@xcite additionally , large shower fluctuations may occur ( for a proposal to reduce the effect of shower fluctuations when reconstructing photon energies , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the ( for arrays larger ) uncertainty when relating different energy scales may be avoided by analysing the photon _ flux _ rather than the fraction , as for the flux , only the photon energy scale is required ( and @xmath78 is usually well controlled for arrays , see above )",
    ".    within the flux level experimentally allowed for photons , the different detector response to photons introduces a systematic uncertainty when reconstructing an energy spectrum .",
    "an example of how the high - energy end of the spectrum from first auger data can change when simply assuming a constant factor two between photon and proton energies is shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "detector responses to deep showers in general are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "no photon detection has been reported so far .",
    "upper limits to photons come from different experiments , see also figure  [ fig - uplim ] .    comparing rates of near - vertical showers to inclined ones recorded with the haverah park water detectors , upper limits ( 95% c.l . ) of 48% above @xmath9  ev ( 52 events ) and 50% above @xmath79  ev ( 10 events ) were deduced.@xcite from simulations , ground signals were found to be stronger suppressed for photons than for nuclear primaries at large zenith angles .",

    "assuming a mixture of primary photons and protons , limits ( 95% c.l . ) to the photon fraction were estimated to be 28% above @xmath9  ev ( 102 events ) and 67% above @xmath82  ev ( 14 events).@xcite the data were compared to an overall simulated distribution , i.e.  not event - by - event .",
    "there seem to be some `` photon - like '' events ( not commented on in the paper ) : in about five events , the measured @xmath80 is considerably ( factor @xmath14 or more ) below typical values expected for nuclear primaries ; in additional four events , the ( at least two ) muon detectors registered no signal ; one event of @xmath83  ev ( energy scale for nuclear primaries ) was observed with a value @xmath80 about a factor @xmath12.5 below an average expected from a data fit .",
    "a comparison to individual events is most interesting at highest energy where every second event could be a photon ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig - uplim ] ) . observed event features can be compared to high - statistics photon simulations , and the chance probability of photons to generate such an event can be determined .",

    "the telescope array@xcite of scintillators , under construction in utah , will cover a @xmath1760  km@xmath114 area ( @xmath125% of the southern auger array ) overviewed by fluorescence telescopes .",
    "space missions such as the proposed euso@xcite and owl@xcite projects may offer a significant increase of the experimental exposure to cosmic rays at highest energy .",
    "photons , as the gauge bosons of the electromagnetic force , at such enormous energy can be regarded as unique messengers and probes of extreme and , possibly , new physics .",
    "implications are related to the production of photons , their propagation , and interactions at the earth .",
    "many aspects of the following , incomplete list of possible impacts of uhe photon searches and connections to other research subjects require more study .",
    "large uhe photon fluxes are a _ smoking gun _ for current non - acceleration models .",
    "stringent photon limits give parameter constraints such as a lower limit on the lifetime of relic shdm particles.@xcite    findings on photons are needed to reduce corresponding systematics in other air shower studies , such as for the energy spectrum ( section [ sub - det ] ) or when trying to constrain interaction parameters such as the proton - air cross - section@xcite from showers .",
    "uhe photons may be helpful for diagnostics of sources accelerating nuclear primaries , as the photon fluxes from uhe hadron interactions are expected to be connected with source features such as type of primary , injection spectrum , possible beam dump at the source , or source distribution ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "uhe photons point back to the location of their production .",
    "possibly , the arrival directions of photons may correlate better with the source direction than those of charged primaries .",
    "there may be an enhanced uhe photon flux from the galactic center region depending on the spectra of nuclear primaries.@xcite in certain shdm scenarios , an enhanced flux of @xmath1@xmath0  ev photons from the galactic center is possible without a higher - energy counterpart.@xcite    propagation features of uhe photons are sensitive to the mhz radio background.@xcite the photon flux at earth is also sensitive to extragalactic magnetic fields.@xcite    already a small sample of photon - induced showers may provide relatively clean probes of aspects of qed and qcd at ultra - high energy via the preshower process and photonuclear interactions ( section [ sub - process ] )",
    ".    certain implications will be most powerful in combination with other results from shower observation ( spectrum , anisotropy , nuclear composition ) and , probably , with results using other messenger particles ( uhe neutrinos , lower energy photons ) .",
    "parallel to uhe photons , uhe neutrinos are usually produced , see eq .",
    "( [ eq - production ] ) . due to",
    "the much longer mean free path of uhe neutrinos , searches for uhe photons and uhe neutrinos complement each other , with uhe photons ( neutrinos ) testing more local ( distant ) production sites .",
    "the disappearance of uhe photons during propagation is accompanied by an appearance of gev - tev photons , cf .",
    "( [ eq - propagation ] ) and figure [ fig - mfp ] ( see also ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "similar to ( but independent of ) uhe neutrinos , these gev - tev photons allow a test of more distant production sites .",
    "the close relation between different messengers is reflected by the fact that constraints on non - acceleration models also come from uhe neutrino and gev photon data , see e.g.  refs.@xcite .",
    "the full information could be exploited by _ multi - messenger observations_. for instance , for known sources of uhe cosmic rays , fluxes of uhe photons much below the expected level could indicate certain new physics .",
    "there are several connections to lorentz invariance violation.@xcite the production of gzk photons can be affected as well as interactions of photons during propagation and when initiating a cascade at the earth . particularly , photon conversion ( interaction with background fields or preshower process ) may be suppressed .",
    "it is interesting to check whether uhe photon propagation could be affected by the presence of axions or scalar bosons .",
    "formal requirements for photon conversion regarding photon energy and magnetic field strength , appear to be fulfilled.@xcite photon conversions to non - electromagnetic channels may differ from the standard qed process of eq .",
    "( [ eq - propagation ] ) due to an absence of an electromagnetic sub - cascade .",
    "uhe photon propagation can be modified in certain models of brane worlds,@xcite quantum gravity theory,@xcite or spacetime foam@xcite .",
    "for instance , depending on fundamental length scales significant scattering of photons on structures ( defects ) in spacetime foam can occur . in turn",
    ", constraints may be derived when actually observing uhe photons , even with one gold - plated event only.@xcite",
    "uhe photons are tracers of highest - energy processes and new physics .",
    "showers initiated by such photons can well be distinguished from those by nuclear primaries .",
    "when complemented by a large northern site , the pierre auger observatory is expected to be sensitive to photon fractions of 0.1% and below and can realistically aim at photon observations .",
    "the search for uhe photons contributes to multi - messenger observations of the universe .",
    "a key characteristic for the progress in astrophysics is to expand to photon wavelengths beyond the optical ; the observation of uhe photons would bring this to the highest end .",
