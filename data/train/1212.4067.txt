    "a discovery of @xmath1  decay would have significant implications on particle physics and other fields , including cosmology  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the topic has stimulated the development of several experimental approaches to the search for @xmath1  decay on a number of isotopes which undergo double beta decay .",

    "the experimental result is a measurement of , or a limit on , the half life , @xmath4 , for the process . within the three neutrino model and assuming",
    "the existence of a significant majorana component a positive observation of @xmath1  decay would possibly give access to the neutrino mass hierarchy as well as information on the absolute values of the neutrino masses .",
    "the latter is only possible with knowledge of the nuclear matrix elements , @xmath5 , as discussed in ref .",
    "the statements on the mass also require an understanding of whether the @xmath1  process is solely due to the majorana nature of the neutrino , or whether additional new physics processes beyond the standard model contribute .",
    "a recent review of the particle physics implications of a discovery of @xmath1  decay was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nuclides that are potentially @xmath1  emitters will decay via the standard model allowed @xmath6  decay . both reactions are second order weak interactions , and therefore have extremely long half lives .",
    "values have been directly measured for @xmath6  decay in about ten cases and these are in the range 10@xmath710@xmath8 yr  @xcite .",
    "the half lives for @xmath1  decay , assuming the process exists , are expected to be substantially longer .",
    "consequently , @xmath1  decay experiments must be sensitive to just a few events per year for a source with a mass of tens to hundreds of kilograms .",
    "backgrounds must typically be reduced to the level of one event per year in the region of interest ( roi ) , an energy interval of the order of the energy resolution around @xmath3 .",
    "experiments looking for @xmath1  decay of @xmath0ge  operate germanium diodes normally made from enriched material , i.e.  the number of @xmath0ge  nuclei , the isotopic fraction @xmath9 , is enlarged from 7.8  % to 86  % or higher . in these type of experiments ,",
    "the source is equal to the detector which yields high detection efficiency .",
    "additional advantages of this technique are the superior energy resolution of 0.2  % at @xmath3=2039  kev compared to other searches with different isotopes and the high radiopurity of the crystal growing procedure .",
    "disadvantages are the relatively low @xmath3  value since backgrounds typically fall with energy and the relative difficulty to scale to larger mass compared to e.g.  experiments using liquids and gases .",
    "there is a considerable history to the use of @xmath0ge for the search for @xmath1  decay .",
    "after initial experiments  @xcite , the heidelberg - moscow ( hdm ) collaboration  @xcite and igex  @xcite were the driving forces in this field setting the most stringent limits . in 2004 a subgroup of the hdm  collaboration  @xcite claimed a 4@xmath10 significance for the observation of @xmath1  decay with a best value of @xmath4=1.19@xmath11  yr ; the quoted 3@xmath10 range is @xmath12 yr . to scrutinize this result , and to push the sensitivity to much higher levels ,",
    "two new @xmath0ge experiments have been initiated : majorana  @xcite and gerda  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been built in the infn laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) at a depth of 3500mw.e .",
    "( water equivalent ) . whereas majorana  further refines the background reduction techniques in the traditional approach of operating germanium detectors in vacuum , gerda  submerses bare high - purity germanium detectors enriched in @xmath0ge into liquid argon ( lar ) following a suggestion by ref .",
    "@xcite ; lar serves simultaneously as a shield against external radioactivity and as cooling medium .",
    "phase  i of the experiment is currently taking data and will continue until a sensitivity is reached which corresponds to an exposure of 15  kg@xmath13yr  with a background index ( bi ) of 10@xmath14  cts/(kev@xmath13kg@xmath13yr )  @xcite ) .",
    "this will be sufficient to make a strong statement on the existence of @xmath1  decay in @xmath0ge for the best value given in ref .",
    "@xcite . phase  ii of gerda  is planned to acquire an exposure of 100  kg@xmath13yr  at a bi of 10@xmath15  cts/(kev@xmath13kg@xmath13yr ) . for pure majorana exchange and the case",
    "that no signal is seen , this will constrain the effective neutrino mass @xmath16 to less than about @xmath17  mev with the precise value depending on the choice of matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the gerda  experiment is described in detail in the following sections .",
    "an overview of experimental constraints and the design is presented first .",
    "this is followed by a description of the ge detectors . then , the experimental setup , electronic readout , data acquisition ( daq ) and data processing are described . as gerda  phase",
    "i has been fully commissioned and has started data production , the main characteristics of its performance are given in the final section .",
    "the experimental challenge is to have nearly background free conditions in the roi around @xmath3 .",
    "typically , background levels are quoted in units of counts per kev per kilogram per year , cts/(kev@xmath13kg@xmath13yr ) , since the number of background events roughly scales with the detector mass , energy resolution and running time . defining @xmath18 as the width of the roi where a signal is searched for , the expected background is the bi multiplied by @xmath18 in kev and the exposure in kg@xmath13yr .",
    "gerda  has set the goal to keep the expected background below 1  event . for @xmath19  kev and exposures mentioned above",
    ", this implies a bi of 0.01 and 0.001  cts/(kev@xmath13kg@xmath13yr ) , respectively , for the two phases of gerda .",
    "the main feature of the gerda  design is to operate bare ge detectors made out of material enriched in @xmath0ge ( @xmath20ge ) in lar .",
    "this design concept evolved from a proposal to operate ge detectors in liquid nitrogen ( ln@xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "it allows for a significant reduction in the cladding material around the diodes and the accompanying radiation sources as compared to traditional ge experiments .",
    "furthermore , the background produced by interactions of cosmic rays is lower than for the traditional concepts of hdm , igex  or majorana  due to the lower z of the shielding material .",
    "other background sources include neutrons and gammas from the decays in the rock of the underground laboratory , radioactivity in support materials , radioactive elements in the cryogenic liquid ( intrinsic , such as @xmath22ar and @xmath23ar , as well as externally introduced , such as radon ) as well as internal backgrounds in the ge diodes .",
    "these backgrounds were considered in the design and construction phase of gerda and resulted in specific design choices , selection of materials used and also in how detectors were handled .",
    "natural ge ( @xmath24ge ) contains about 7.8% @xmath0ge , and could in principle be used directly for a @xmath1  decay experiment .",
    "indeed , the first searches for @xmath1  decay used natural ge detectors  @xcite .",
    "enriched detectors allow for a better signal - to - background ratio and also yield reduced costs for a fixed mass of @xmath0ge in the experiment .",
    "the improvement in signal - to - background ratio originates from two sources : ( @xmath25 ) many background sources , such as backgrounds from external gamma rays , are expected to scale with the total mass of the detector ; and ( @xmath26 ) the cosmogenic production of @xmath27ge and @xmath28co in the ge diodes occurs at a higher rate for @xmath24ge  than for @xmath20ge .",
    "the lower overall cost is due to the fact that the high cost of enrichment is more than offset by the cost of producing the extra crystals and diodes required for @xmath24ge  detectors .",
    "[ fig : overview ] shows a model of the realized design : the core of the experiment is an array of germanium diodes suspended in strings into a cryostat filled with lar .",
    "the lar serves both as cooling medium and shield .",
    "the cryostat is a steel vessel with a copper lining used primarily to reduce the gamma radiation from the steel vessel .",
    "the cryostat is placed in a large water tank , that fulfills the functions of shielding the inner volumes from radiation sources within the hall , such as neutrons , as well as providing a sensitive medium for a muon veto system .",
    "a similar experimental setup has been proposed previously in ref .",
    "the detectors are lowered into the lar volume using a lock system located in a clean room on top of the water tank .",

    "no increase of the lc was observed with the same detector assembly in ln@xmath21 after one week of irradiation .",
