    "the existence of `` dark matter '' ( dm ) in the universe has been demonstrated by modern astrophysical and cosmological observations , such as rotation curves of spiral galaxies , masses of intra - cluster gas , gravitational lensing of clusters of galaxies , and observational data of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and large scale structure .",
    "it is considered to constitute about a quarter of the total energy density in the present universe and to occupy more than 80 % of the total mass density .",
    "the current `` standard cosmology '' , the @xmath7-cold dark matter ( @xmath7cdm ) model , assumes that dark energy and dm play prominent roles in gravitational effects in the formation of structure in the universe . since nucleosynthesis models of the early universe place limits on the fraction of baryons , dm can not be baryonic matter , which forms a part of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "the nature of dm is thus an issue of fundamental significance .",
    "several candidates such as `` wimps '' ( weakly interacting massive particles ) , `` super - wimps '' and `` sterile neutrinos '' postulated , and either direct or indirect dm searches have been conducted to find them .",
    "however , none of them have been successful at present .",
    "searching for photon emission from the decay or annihilation of dm particles through astrophysical observations is a promising approach to the discovery of dm , and the x - ray region is one of the possible windows . in particular , sterile neutrinos as dm candidates attract a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "they could be generated sufficiently in the early universe through given mechanisms , for example the non - resonant or resonant production @xcite and decay of scalar field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the relic sterile neutrino abundance from scattering - induced conversion of active neutrinos was first analytically estimated by @xcite and able to account for all of dm .",
    "the model containing sterile neutrinos is strongly motivated by the neutrino flavor oscillation which is supported by the atmospheric neutrino evidence of the super - kamiokande @xcite , the baryon asymmetry of the universe and other curious things beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "the flavor oscillation between sterile neutrinos and active neutrinos or radiative decay is predicted although its mixing angle may be very small .",
    "associated with the decay , a photon with the energy @xmath8 are emitted ( @xmath9 is the mass of sterile neutrinos , @xmath10 is the speed of light ) .",
    "a kev - mass sterile neutrino is a warm dm ( wdm ) candidate @xcite .",
    "it resolves several inconsistencies between the predictions of the cdm model and the observational results such as the shape and smoothness of dm halos @xcite .",
    "since the kev - mass sterile neutrinos should decay and produce a kev x - ray photon , a search for this radiative decay emission line in the x - ray range is meaningful .",
    "radiatively decaying dm such as sterile neutrinos have been vigorously searched for by x - ray observatories . , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite searched dm in the local group , i.e. the milky way galaxy , its satellite dwarf galaxies and m31 , and obtained the tightest restriction on the dm line intensity . in 2014 ,",
    "several papers reported a possible x - ray emission line around 3.5 kev . in @xcite , the first report of this line , xmm - newton observational spectra of 73 clusters of galaxies were used to search for a non - baryonic emission line .",
    "the significance of this detection was as high as 4.3@xmath0 .",
    "independently , @xcite found this line in the perseus cluster and m31 with the 4.4@xmath0 significance .",
    "other groups @xcite , however , could not confirm this detection with the same instruments or the same targets and gave the upper limits . at the center of the milky way galaxy",
    ", @xcite reported to detect the 3.54 kev line by xmm - newton , while @xcite and @xcite obtained upper limits by chandra and by xmm - newton , respectively . due to the complexity of the instrument responses and possible astrophysical emission ( e.g. k around 3.5 kev )",
    ", a search for dm requires careful studies . in this paper",
    ", we selected the best observational target for the dm search in the kev energy range with x - ray ccd instruments and searched for a non - baryonic x - ray signature to provide valuable constraints on the parameter space of dm .",
    "all error ranges in our text and tables correspond to 90 % confidence levels , and vertical error bars in our figures indicate 1@xmath0 . throughout this paper , we assume the following values for cosmological parameters : the energy density parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the hubble constant @xmath13 .",
    "we utilized ftools in heasoft version 6.15 and xspec version 12.8.1 for this analysis .",
    "selecting suitable targets and instruments is important in searching for dm in the kev energy range .",
    "gravitational sources with high dm column density such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies are plausible candidate targets .",
    "since we are located within the dm distribution of the milky way , we also have the potential to detect its signal over the whole sky , even in the blank sky .",
    "such targets , however , contain high temperature plasma and so are sources of x - rays as background emission .",
    "the dm column density in the perseus cluster or a rich cluster of galaxies was estimated as @xmath14 @xmath5 pc@xmath6 @xcite . that of m31 is @xmath15 ( 200  1000 ) @xmath5 pc@xmath6 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we estimated the distribution of the dm within the milky way by the nfw profile with parameters from @xcite , as @xmath16 @xmath5 pc@xmath6 and @xmath17 kpc , and calculated the column density as a function of an angle from the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "it is @xmath18 @xmath5 pc@xmath6 towards the gc and decreases to 40 @xmath5 pc@xmath6 at the anti - center .",
    "the sensitivity of the line detection is limited by the background emission .",
    "we simulated mock suzaku spectra for the perseus cluster , m31 , and a typical blank sky observation with the same field of view ( fov ) and exposure time .",
    "the blank sky is occupied by the x - ray diffuse background ( xdb ) which consists of plasma emission in the milky way and a superposition of extragalactic point sources . typically , the surface brightness of the perseus or m31 are @xmath19 or @xmath20 times brighter , and the line detection limits for them are @xmath20 or @xmath21 times higher than that for the blank sky .",
    "the meaning of `` typical '' is that there are much line emission from the associated plasma , which hinder the dm detection at various energies even if they are modeled well .",
    "potential sensitivity for the dm detection is evaluated by the dm column density divided by the line detection limit .",
    "the sensitivity for m31 and the blank sky are almost at the same level , which is @xmath21 times better than that for the perseus cluster .",
    "we then evaluated the sensitivity based on the actual observation cases by x - ray observatories , suzaku , xmm - newton and chandra , with realistic instrumental responses and non - x - ray background ( nxb ) , as well as available exposure time and sky coverage of archival data .",
    "the total exposure time for archival data of the perseus cluster is larger than that of m31 , but could not compensate the sensitivity limited by the cluster emission as background . in the archives",
    ", there are hundreds of observational data sets of blank sky regions or maskable faint compact sources which are dominated by the xdb and used to search for dm associated with the milky way . the total photon statistics for these xdb data is larger than that for the other targets including m31 . due to the low surface brightness of the xdb , however , the nxb would also limit the sensitivity .",
    "the nxb of xmm - newton ( mos , pn ) and chandra ( acis - i , acis - s ) for corresponding sky coverage are comparable to surface brightness levels between that of m31 and xdb observations .",
    "thus the line sensitivity for the xdb observation by xmm - newton and chandra are limited by their nxb . on the other hand , the x - ray telescope and x - ray imaging spectrometer of suzaku ( xrt - xis ; @xcite ) combined to give the lowest and most - stable nxb owing to combination of the low - earth orbit and the instrumental design .",
    "using suzaku xis observational data of the xdb is therefore the most suitable for this study .",
    "we note that we gave up to use the gc regions because there are number of bright point sources and diffuse structure which are difficult to be modeled and subtracted . in this paper , we used cleaned event files of the fi - ccds ( xis0 , 2 and 3 ) and the bi - ccd ( xis1 ) of suzaku .",
    "we collected approximately - pure xdb data in the suzaku xis archive from 2005 to 2013 that satisfied the requirements shown below :    1 .",
    "no bright sources ( i.e. original observational purpose are blank sky fields study ) or maskable faint compact sources are in the xis fov .",
    "2 .   galactic latitudes @xmath22 to avoid the x - ray emission peculiar to the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "separate from the region occupied by the north polar spur and other local x - ray sources .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal clocking mode and the @xmath23 or @xmath24 editing mode .",
    "ultimately , 187 suzaku xis observational data sets were selected as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we collected more xdb data than has been observed previously by the suzaku xis .",
    "since many complex unresolvable emission appears in the low energy range ( @xmath25 kev ) and xdb photons are not adequately available ( nxb photons dominate ) in the high energy range ( @xmath26 kev ) , we used the 0.7  7 kev and the 0.5  5 kev ranges for the fi - ccds ( xis0 , 2 and 3 ) and the bi - ccd ( xis1 ) , respectively . signals from anomalous ( hot and flickering ) pixels in the xiss were screened out with the ftool cleansis .",
    "we first conducted an imaging analysis over all of the data in order to reject resolvable x - ray point sources contaminating the xdb spectra .",
    "the procedure was the following :    1 .",
    "xis images of the 0.5  7 kev range were extracted .",
    "point sources in the xis fovs were detected and rejected by using a wavelet function of similar size to the point spread function of the xrt - xis using wavdetect from the chandra interactive analysis of observations , version 4.6 .",
    "point sources whose flux was larger than @xmath27 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 in the 0.5  7 kev range were removed with circular regions centered at their positions . the radius of the circular regions @xmath28 were determined such that these regions included @xmath29 % of source photons .",
    "second , in order to remove x - ray emission from the earth s atmosphere and from the solar wind , and to reduce the nxb , we also selected good time intervals by applying the following criteria , as was done in @xcite :    1 .",
    "the elevation angle from the bright / dark earth limb was chosen as @xmath30/@xmath31 to avoid fluorescent emission lines from the earth s atmosphere .",
    "2 .   time intervals excluding the south atlantic anomaly passage 3 .",
    "the cut off rigidity ( cor2 ) @xmath32 gv @xmath33 to reduce the high - energy - charged - particle background due to the low earth s magnetic field @xcite .",
    "time periods when the proton flux in the solar wind fell below the typical threshold , @xmath34 @xmath2 s@xmath3 , to lower effects of the geocoronal - solar wind charge exchange @xcite .",
    "the proton flux was observed with monitoring satellites : ace / swepam and wind / swe .",
    "after this data screening , the total exposure time becomes 31.5 msec @xmath35 year , and we obtained @xmath36 counts of photons in the 0.5  7 kev range .",
    "this is the largest data for the xdb with the suzaku xis .",
    "we then reproduced instrumental responses at the time of each observation .",
    "the energy redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) including quantum efficiency and energy responses ( energy scale and resolution ) of the xiss were generated by the ftools xisrmfgen .",
    "the ancillary response files ( arfs ) involving angular responses and effective area of the xrt - xis modules were produced by the suzaku calibration database and monte - carlo ray - tracing simulations : the ftools xissimarfgen @xcite . in xissimarfgen , we assumed a uniform sky centered at each observational coordinate with radius of 20 arcmin as an x - ray emitting region for the simulation .",
    "the xdb spectra are contaminated by the nxb which originates from charged particles , electrical noise , and scattered and fluorescent x - ray emission from instrumental elements .",
    "the nxb contributions in the given spectra was also estimated from accumulated night - earth observations around 150 days centered at the day of each observation with the ftool xisnxbgen @xcite .",
    "the nominal responses deserved above are based on the calibration data and the ray - tracing simulation .",
    "however , a certain level of deviation exists in the response reproduction in the 1.5  3.5 kev due to difficulty of dealing with the complicated multiple absorption edges in the xrt - xis effective area . in order to check this reproducibility ,",
    "we analyzed the stacked spectrum of the crab nebula ( hereafter simply crab ) , the data with the lowest statistical uncertainty of all suzaku xis data whose total count of photons in the 0.5  7 kev range is @xmath37 .",
    "the crab emission is well modeled by a featureless spectrum of synchrotron emission .",
    "we assumed the emission model for the observed spectrum to be a power - law function absorbed by the interstellar medium of the milky way .",
    "we fitted the crab spectrum with the model multiplied by the response and found the residuals of up to @xmath21 % especially in the 1.5  3.5 kev range .",
    "the deviations were regarded as being due to a mis - reproduction of the response , and these were used to correct the responses .",
    "the nxb including the instrumental emission lines have been estimated and subtracted with night - earth observational data as described in @xcite , with a typical error of 3 % .",
    "there are known instrument lines of al - k@xmath38 , si - k@xmath38 , au - m@xmath38 , mn - k@xmath38 and mn - k@xmath39 .",
    "we found that subtleties resulting from the subtraction of these lines can be mitigated by spectral fitting with a five - gaussian model .",
    "once the 187 sets of the xdb spectra , the rmfs , the arfs and the nxb data were obtained , we then stacked the xdb spectra using the ftool mathpha .",
    "this was done to increase the number of photons and so to reduce the statistical uncertainty . with consideration for both the changes in the instrumental - calibration and the difference among the four detectors that make up the xis , we divided the entire period ( 2005  2013 ) into 8 periods to sort by instrumental calibration conditions ( e.g. sci setting ) as shown in table [ table1 ] and stacked the xdb data in each of the shorter periods . after correcting for systematic deviations , the total - photon - count - weighted average ( in the 0.5  7 kev range ) of rmfs @xmath40 arfs ( responses )",
