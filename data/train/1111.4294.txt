    "transition metal oxide clusters have attracted enormous attention because their structural , electronic , and magnetic properties are often quite different from those in their bulk phase @xcite .",
    "for example , small clusters like ( zno)@xmath0 , ( v@xmath4o@xmath9)@xmath0 , ( cro@xmath5)@xmath0 form planar structures with very small sizes , and some small clusters present novel magnetic properties @xcite . for scandium ( sc )",
    ", continuous interests are shown for several reasons .",
    "firstly , sc is the first transition metal in the periodic table , and thus is always taken as a prototype to study the complex phenomena associated with @xmath8 shell electrons @xcite .",
    "secondly , sc oxide nanostructures can be used as catalysts in some reactions like the selective reduction of nitric oxides with methane @xcite .",
    "thirdly , some sc oxide clusters have been recognized in the spectra of m - type stars @xcite .",
    "finally , some sc oxide clusters can be steadily encapsulated into closed carbon cages of fullerenes to form a novel nanostructure @xcite .",
    "the small scandium oxide clusters can be prepared by laser ablation of scandium metal in the presence of oxygen - saturated atmosphere @xcite . with the presence of oxygen or nitrogen oxide gases , scandium oxide clusters ranging from sco to sc@xmath5o@xmath10",
    "have already been generated and detected @xcite .",
    "many experimental studies have already been applied to study the structural , energetic , vibrational , electronic , and magnetic properties of scandium oxide clusters .",
    "for example , the photoionization spectra of sc@xmath0o were measured and strongly size - dependent ionization potentials were observed @xcite . for the sco molecule , the electron - spin resonance and optical spectroscopy in neon and argon matrices revealed that its ground state is a doublet @xcite , and the molecular bond length and vibrational frequency have been measured to be 1.668    and 965 @xmath11 respectively @xcite . accompanying with these experimental results , lots of theoretical calculations , especially those based on density functional theory ( dft ) ,",
    "were also carried out to explore the ground - state electronic structures of scandium oxide clusters . however ,",
    "most of those studies on sc oxide clusters were mostly on the standard dft level , within the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) . in this paper",
    ", we systematically study the atomic and electronic structures of sc oxide clusters using the screened hybrid density functional theory , which has proven to be able to significantly improve the description of finite , molecular systems , such as atomization energies , bond lengths and vibrational frequencies using standard dft theories @xcite .",
    "for extended systems , the ground - state electronic properties can be obtained by solving the kohn - sham equation within dft @xcite , utilizing the standard approximations for the exchange - correlation ( @xmath12 ) energy functional @xmath13 , i.e. , lda and gga .",
    "one problem of the two most commonly applied functionals is that they rely on the @xmath12 energy per particle of the uniform electron gas , and thus are expected to be useful only for systems with slowly varying electron densities ( local / semilocal approximation ) @xcite .",
    "although the lda and gga functionals have proven to be rather universally applicable in theoretical materials science and achieve fairly good accuracy for ionization energies of atoms , dissociation energies of molecules , and cohesive energies , as well as bond lengths and geometries of molecules and solids @xcite , this unexpectedly good performance for the ground - state properties of many materials is believed to be due to the partial error cancelation in the exchange and correlation energies @xcite . in order to improve the performance of dft on a theoretical basis ,",
    "one approach is to add a portion of the non - local hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange to the local / semilocal approximation for exchange - correlation functional . in computational solid state physics ,",
    "a breakthrough was achieved by heyd , scuseria , and ernzerhof , who proposed the hse03 functional defined by @xcite : @xmath14 the hse03 functional benefits from the range separation of the hf exchange into a short-(sr ) and long - range ( lr ) contribution and replaces the latter by the corresponding dft exchange part . the hse03 functional as well as its corrected form the hse06 functional @xcite ,",
    "have been extensively applied to calculate ground - state properties of solid and molecular systems , as well as adsorption energies for molecules , and have proven to be better than the lda and gga functionals in describing finite molecular systems .",
    "the results presented in this work are obtained using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . for standard dft calculations",
    "the @xmath12 energy is treated within the gga using the parameterization of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite to compare with previously published calculations . in the present hse calculations ,",
    "the hse06 hybrid functional @xcite is applied , where the range separation parameter is set to 0.2 @xmath15 for both the semilocal as well as the nonlocal part of the exchange functional . from now on , this particular functional will be referred to as hse . a plane wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 ev is adopted , and the scandium 3_s_@xmath163_p_@xmath174_s_@xmath163_d_@xmath18 and oxygen 2_s_@xmath162_p_@xmath19 electrons are treated as fully relaxed valence electrons .",
    "a fermi broadening @xcite of 0.05 ev is chosen to smear the occupation of the bands around the fermi energy ( e@xmath20 ) by a finite-@xmath21 fermi function and extrapolating to @xmath22 k. the supercell containing the scandium oxide clusters is chosen to be without symmetry , and the cell size along each direction is larger than 15  . a quasi - newton algorithm is used to relax the scandium and oxygen ions for all scandium oxide clusters , with the force convergence criteria of 0.01 ev /    in pbe calculations and 0.03 ev /    in hse calculations .",
    "firstly , the sco and two isomers of sco@xmath4 are shown in fig.1 ( a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "the optimized bond length of sco is 1.677    in pbe calculation , and 1.659    in hse calculation .",
    "the pbe result is in good agreement with former gga calculations @xcite .",
    "the hse06 result is near the ones obtained from the scf @xcite and hybrid b1lyp calculations @xcite .",
    "both gga and hse06 calculations agree well with the experimental bond length ( 1.668 ) @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to note that these two sc - o bonds are not equivalent and the bond lengths are 1.687 and 1.928 respectively . in pbe calculations ,",
    "the triangle is isosceles , with the apex angle of 126.19@xmath23 and the sco bond length of 1.781   , in agreement with that have been found by using the dft / pbe @xcite and dft / bpw91 methods @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the hse06 calculation reduces the symmetry of the ground state .",

    "the sc - o bond lengths are 1.892 , 1.698 , 1.892 and 1.698    respectively .",
    "since the pbe calculation prefers the rhombus with d@xmath26 symmetry , our result is in accordance with the rule that the hse06 functional tends to reduce the point group symmetry of some clusters obtained from the pbe calculations .",

    "_ , the ground - state structure of sc@xmath4o@xmath6 is the one with a molecular o@xmath4 adsorbing at one corner of the rhombus sc@xmath4o@xmath4 cluster , which is however , proven to be the next stable structure for sc@xmath4o@xmath6 .",

    "the next stable structure of sc@xmath5o is the one with an oxygen atom adsorbing at the bottom of an isosceles scandium triangle , having a singlet electronic state and a free electronic energy of 0.16 ev higher than that of the ground - state of sc@xmath5o . except for sc@xmath5o ,",
    "other sc@xmath5o@xmath1 clusters have seldom been studied before . only a systematic study on the sc@xmath5o@xmath10 cluster",
    "is reported very recently @xcite .",
    "the ground - state of sc@xmath5o@xmath4 is the doublet state of the adsorbing structure of a scandium atom on the sc@xmath4o@xmath4 cluster .",

    "4(a ) , the ground - state structure for sc@xmath5o@xmath9 can be seen as adding an oxygen atom on top of the scandium atom in the ground - state structure of sc@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "the sc - o bond lengths become a little smaller than that in sc@xmath5o@xmath6 . the next stable structure of sc@xmath5o@xmath9",
    "is the adsorption of 5 oxygen atoms on a sc@xmath5 linear chain , whose free electronic energy is however , much larger than the ground - state .",
    "the 3 lowest - energy structures of sc@xmath5o@xmath10 are the adsorption structures of 6 oxygen atoms on the sc@xmath5 triangle . in the ground state ,",
    "the oxygen atoms are separated from each other , while in the next and third stable structure , two of the six oxygen atoms bond together .",
    "we also find that the structures contain a sc@xmath5 chain always have much larger free electronic energies .      based on the above systematic study of sc@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters",
    ", we can see some features for both the oxidation pattern of scandium , and the influences of hse calculation .    for the oxidation of scandium",
    ", we conclude two important features .",
    "the first one is that the sc@xmath0o@xmath1 cluster can be seen as adding @xmath3 oxygen atoms to a sc@xmath0 cluster , with the sc@xmath0 cluster to be scandium dimer for @xmath2=2 , and scandium triangle for @xmath2=3 .",
    "the other feature is that the oxygen atoms in the ground - states of sc@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters are all bondless with each other , only one o - o bond forms in sc@xmath4o@xmath6 .",
    "the fact that oxygen atoms do not bond with each other indicates that scandium oxide clusters are different from lead oxide clusters , in which oxygen atoms can form o@xmath4 or o@xmath5 units @xcite . the structural features of sc@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters tell us that they can be built by adding @xmath3 oxygen atoms separately to a sc@xmath0 cluster .    as for the improvements of the hse method ,",
    "the most important one is that the symmetry of the cluster is often lower in hse calculation than in pbe calculation .",
    "the lengths of sc - o bonds always differ from each other in a cluster after geometry optimization using the hse method .",
    "the second feature concluded from the above geometrical studies is that the hse method does not change the relative stability between different structures .",
    "it means that geometry optimization using the pbe type functional will not yield wrong ground - state structures for scandium oxide clusters . at last , although the electronic structures in pbe and hse calculations are the same for most sc@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters , we do see differences in the ground - state electronic structures of sc@xmath5o@xmath4 and sc@xmath5o@xmath5 . in pbe calculations ,",
    "the magnetic moment is 3 @xmath28 for sc@xmath5o@xmath4 , and 1 @xmath28 for sc@xmath5o@xmath5 . and corresponding the magnetic moments obtained from hse calculations are 1 @xmath28 for sc@xmath5o@xmath4 , and 3 @xmath28 for sc@xmath5o@xmath5 .",
    "the stability of scandium oxide clusters with different sizes and stoichiometries is required to illustrate the growth pattern of various nanostructures and to understand even the oxidation behavior of the pristine scandium clusters . on the other hand , the study of the stability is helpful for finding the candidates of the building block of the cluster - assembled materials .",
    "therefore , in the following , we evaluate the fragmentation energy of sc@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters .",
    "o@xmath1 clusters as a function of the oxygen atom number @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding fragmentation channels are listed in table i. ]    [ c ]",

    "in addition , the half of the total energy of an oxygen molecule is adopted as the reference energy for atomic oxygen .",
    "note that a fragmentation process is exothermic ( endothermic ) if the associated fragmentation energy is negative ( positive ) .",
    "the dissociation energy @xmath29 , defined as the fragmentation energy of the most favorable channel , is calculated and presented in table i. in general , the cluster with large positive @xmath29 has great stability , and that with small positive or even negative @xmath29 is not stable and tends to dissociate . moreover , the frequently observed fragmentation products are believed to be stable @xcite . figure 5 shows the @xmath29 as a function of the oxygen atom numbers for for all clusters , revealing the underlying relationship between stability and stoichiometry of these clusters .",
    "the essential features can be discussed as follows .",
    "firstly , for the dissociation of sc - rich clusters , the sc atom is always one of the fragments . to make a further validation",
    ", we also study possible fragmentation ways for the sc@xmath6o cluster , using the hse calculational method .",
    "it is found that the most energetically favored fragmentation channel is sc@xmath6o@xmath38sc+sc@xmath5o , in which single sc atom is also a fragment .",
    "secondly , we do not see oxygen molecules in the fragments of sc@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters , the o - rich clusters favor the fragmentation channels that have a single oxygen atom as a product .",
    "lastly , the dissociation energies of sco , sc@xmath4o@xmath4 , sc@xmath4o@xmath5 , sc@xmath5o@xmath5 , and sc@xmath5o@xmath6 clusters are larger than 3.60 ev .",
    "this indicates that the monoxide - like and sesquioxide - like scandium oxide clusters , and oxide clusters between them are remarkably stable . as a result",
    ", these clusters are frequently observed in the fragmentation channels shown in table i. we also notice that the sc@xmath5o@xmath6 cluster has an enormous dissociation energy , and is more stable than the monoxide - like sc@xmath5o@xmath5 cluster . and at another side , the monoxide - like sc@xmath4o@xmath4 cluster , with a larger dissociation energy , is more stable than the the sesquioxide - like sc@xmath4o@xmath5 cluster .",
    "the electronic structures of transition metal oxide clusters are important characters for their experimental detections and chemical applications .",
    "especially , their magnetic properties are very important to reflect the behaviors of the @xmath8-shell electrons .",
    "we thus calculate the ground - state electronic energy levels of sc@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters , using the hse method .",
    "figure 6 shows the obtained energy levels for different spin polarized electrons , in which spin - up and spin - down represent for the majority and minority spin states respectively .",
    "we find that the sc@xmath0o@xmath1 clusters with odd - number sc atoms are all magnetic .",
    "for the sc@xmath4o@xmath1 clusters , while the sc@xmath4o is magnetic , the other sc@xmath4o@xmath4 , sc@xmath4o@xmath5 , and sc@xmath4o@xmath6 clusters are nonmagnetic .",
    "the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) is 1.82 , 3.36 , and 3.20 ev for the sc@xmath4o@xmath4 , sc@xmath4o@xmath5 , and sc@xmath4o@xmath6 cluster respectively .",
