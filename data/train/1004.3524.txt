    "research in complex networks has important applications in today s massive networked systems , including the internet , the world - wide web ( www ) , as well as social , biological and chemical networks @xcite .",
    "the availability of massive databases , and reliable tools for data analysis provides a powerful framework to explore structural properties of large - scale networks blmch06 . in many real - world cases , it is impossible to efficiently retrieve and/or store the exact structure of a complex network due to , for example , a prohibitively large network size or privacy / security concerns . on the other hand ,",
    "it is often possible to gather a great deal of information by examining local samples of the graph topology , such as the degree distribution , which are usually easy to collect . in this context",
    ", a challenging problem is to find relationships between the set of local samples of the network structure and its global functionality .    many dynamical processes on networks , such as random walks @xcite , virus / rumor spreading @xcite,@xcite , and synchronization of oscillators @xcite,@xcite , are interesting to study in the context of large - scale complex networks .",
    "the behavior of many of these processes are intimately related to the eigenvalue spectra of the underlying graph structure @xcite,@xcite .",
    "for example , the speed of spreading of a virus is directly related with the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix of the network @xcite .",
    "hence , spectral graph theory provides us with a framework to study the relationship between the network structure and its dynamical behavior .",
    "network motifs are small subgraphs that are present in a network with a much higher frequently than in random networks with the same degree sequence msikca02 .",
    "there is both empirical and theoretical evidence showing that these subgraphs play a key role in the network s function and organization @xcite .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper is to explicitly relate global properties of a given network with the presence of certain small subgraphs that can be counted via _ local measurements_. we focus our attention on global properties related with the network s eigenvalues , in particular , the so - called spectral moments .",
    "since the spectral properties are known to have a direct influence on the network dynamical behavior , our result builds a bridge between local network measurements ( i.e. , the presence of small subgraphs ) and global dynamical behavior ( via the spectral moments ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that , although a set of spectral moments is not enough to completely describe the spectral distribution of a network , it allows us to extract a great deal of information .",
    "for example , popescu and bertsimas provide in @xcite an optimization framework for computing optimal bounds on the properties of a distribution from moments constrains .",
    "more generally , there is a variety of techniques that can be applied to extract spectral information from a truncated sequence of spectral moments @xcite .",
    "based on our results , we also propose a novel decentralized algorithm to efficiently aggregate a set of local network measurements into global spectral moments .",
    "our work is related to @xcite , where a fully distributed algorithm is proposed to compute the full set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix representing the network topology .",
    "in contrast , our approach is computationally much cheaper , since it does not require a complete eigenvalue decomposition .",
    "furthermore , our approach also provides a clearer view of the role of certain subgraphs in the network s dynamical behavior .",

    "hence , we obtain the same value for @xmath149 directly from ( [ 4th moment ] ) .    from the subgraphs in fig . 2 , and the row of coefficients @xmath150",
    ", we have the following expression for the @xmath151 spectral moment via ( moments from motifs):@xmath152 , \\label{5th moment}\\]]where @xmath51 and @xmath153 is the number of triangles and @xmath124-cycles in @xmath20 . also , we represent by @xmath154 the number of subgraphs isomorphic to the sixth subgraph in the top row of fig .",

    "the main advantage of ( [ moments from motifs ] ) in theorem [ motif theorem ] may not be apparent in graphs with simple , regular structure .",
    "for these graphs , an explicit eigenvalue decomposition is available and there may be no need to look for alternative ways to compute spectral moments . on the other hand , in the case of large - scale complex networks , the structure of the network is usually very intricate , in many cases not even known exactly , and an explicit eigenvalue decomposition can be very challenging , if not impossible .",
    "it is in these cases where the alternative approach proposed in this paper is most useful .",
    "as we show in the next section , the spectral moments can be efficiently computed via a distributed approach from aggregation of local samples of the graph topology , _ without knowing the complete structure of the network_.",
    "according to ( [ moments from motifs ] ) , the @xmath13-th spectral moment is equal to a linear combination of the embedding frequencies @xmath160 for @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , computing the embedding frequencies in large - scale networks can be challenging in a centralized framework , since the computational cost of counting subgraphs rapidly grows with the network size . in this section",
    ", we introduce an efficient decentralized approach to compute the embedding frequencies of subgraphs from local samples of the network topology .    during this section ,",
    "we assume that there is an agent in each node @xmath161 that is able to access its @xmath132-th neighborhood , @xmath162 . a naive approach to compute the embedding frequency of a particular subgraph",
    "@xmath89 would be to compute the embedding frequency of @xmath89 in each neighborhood ,  @xmath163 , and sum them up .",
    "this approach obviously does not work because this particular subgraph @xmath164 can be in the intersection of multiple neighborhoods ; hence , that subgraph would be counted multiple times . in",
    "what follows , we propose a decentralized counting procedure that allow us to know how many times a particular subgraph is counted .",
    "first , we need to introduce several definitions :    we say that a graphical property @xmath165 is _ locally measurable within a radius _ @xmath132 _ _  around a node _ _ @xmath9 if @xmath166 is a function of @xmath167 , i.e. , @xmath168 .",
