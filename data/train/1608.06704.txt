    "over four decades ago , an important chapter of modern astrochemistry was opened by gillett et al .",
    "( 1973 ) who obtained from ground - based observations the @xmath4813@xmath0 spectra of two planetary nebulae ( ngc7027 and bd@xmath530@xmath63639 ) and reported the discovery of a broad emission feature at 11.3@xmath0 .",
    "two additional emission features peaking at 8.6 and 12.7@xmath0 were also prominent in their spectra . since then other features have been observed , including the 6.2 and 7.7@xmath0 bands first discovered in ngc7027 with airborne observations made with the _ kuiper airborne observatory _ ( russell et al .  1977 ) and",
    "the 3.3@xmath0 band first discovered also in ngc7027 through ground - based observations ( merrill et al .",
    "it had already became clear in the 1970s that these bands were part of a family of infrared ( ir ) emission features .",
    "now , this family of emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and 12.7@xmath0 are ubiquitously seen in almost all celestial objects with associated gas and dust , including protoplanetary nebulae ( ppne ) , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , protoplanetary disks around young stars , reflection nebulae , hii regions , the galactic ir cirrus , and external galaxies ( see tielens 2008 ) .",
    "collectively known as the `` unidentified infrared emission '' ( uie ) bands , these features are a common characteristic of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way and nearby galaxies as well as distant galaxies out to redshifts of @xmath7 ( e.g. , see riechers et al .  2014 ) .",
    "the `` uie '' bands earned this name from the fact that the exact nature of their carriers remain unidentified , although many candidate materials have been proposed .",
    "nevertheless , it is now generally accepted that these features are characteristic of the stretching and bending vibrations of some sorts of aromatic hydrocarbon materials ( e.g. , see sellgren 2001 , peeters et al .",
    "2002 , hudgins & allamandola 2005 )    lger & puget ( 1984 ) and allamandola et al .",
    "( 1985 , 1989 ) attributed the uie bands to gas - phase , free - flying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules .",
    "the pah model attributes the uie bands to the vibrational modes of pahs with the 3.3@xmath0 feature assigned to c  h stretching modes , the 6.2@xmath0 and 7.7@xmath0 features to c  c stretching modes , the 8.6@xmath0 feature to c  h in - plane bending modes , and the 11.3@xmath0 feature to c  h out - of - plane bending modes .",
    "alternatively , the uie features have also been attributed to amorphous solids with a mixed aromatic / aliphatic composition like hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ; jones et al .",
    "1990 ) , quenched carbonaceous composites ( qcc ; sakata et al .",
    "1990 ) , coal or kerogen ( papoular et al .",
    "as originally suggested by duley & williams ( 1981 ) , all of these _ solid _ materials share the basic molecular structure of pahs by containing arenes .",
    "they also contain aliphatic c ",
    "h bonds as well as other molecular structures often with other elements besides c and h. one way to distinguish the pah hypothesis from other models is to compare in the uie carriers @xmath8 , the number of carbon ( c ) atoms in aliphatic chains , with @xmath9 , the number of c atoms in aromatic rings .",
    "we define the _ aliphatic fraction _ of the uie carriers as the fraction of c atoms in aliphatic chains . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the aliphatic fraction is approximately @xmath11 , the ratio of the number of aliphatic c atoms to that of aromatic c atoms .",
    "aliphatic hydrocarbons can be probed through their c  h stretching vibrational band at 3.4@xmath0 ( pendleton & allamandola 2002 ) . in many interstellar and circumstellar environments",
    "the 3.3@xmath0 emission feature is indeed often accompanied by a weaker feature at 3.4@xmath0 ( see li & draine 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "the 3.4@xmath0 emission feature itself is often also accompanied by several weak satellite features at 3.43 , 3.46 , 3.51 , and 3.56@xmath0 ( e.g. , see geballe et al .",

    "the observed intensity of the 3.4@xmath0 emission feature , also includes the contributions from the 3.43 , 3.46 , 3.51 , and 3.56@xmath0 satellite features .",
    "we also define @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the band strengths of the aliphatic and aromatic c  h bonds , respectively , on a per unit c  h bond basis .",

    "as demonstrated by li & draine ( 2012 ) and yang et al .  (",
    "2013 ) , one can place an upper limit of @xmath42% on the aliphatic fraction of the emitters of the uie features by assigning the 3.4@xmath0 emission _ exclusively _ to aliphatic c  h ( also see rouill et al .  2012 ,",

    "] however , these studies were mostly based on the @xmath3 ratios derived from the _ mono - methyl _ derivatives of small pah molecules . in reality , the pah molecules in space could harbor larger alkyl side chains such as ethyl , propyl , and butyl .",
    "also , several alkyl side chains might be present in one pah molecule . to explore the effects of _ larger _ alkyl side chains on @xmath3 , in this work we employ density functional theory to compute the ir vibrational spectra of several pah molecules with a wide range of sidegroups including ethyl , propyl , butyl , and several unsaturated alkyl chains . in ",

    "we compute their ir vibrational spectra and report in  [ sec : results ] the calculated @xmath1 and @xmath2 oscillator strengths and their implications on the aliphatic fractions of the uie carriers . in view of the fact that interstellar pahs may have more than one alkyl side chain",
    ", we also consider in  [ sec : results ] the situation that there are two methyl groups attached to a pah molecule , using pyrene as an example .",
    "we summarize our major results in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use the gaussian09 software ( frisch et al .  2009 ) to calculate the ir vibrational spectra for a range of aromatic molecules with a wide range of sidegroups ( see figure  [ fig : longsidechain ] ) .",
    "we employ the hybrid density functional theoretical method ( b3lyp ) at the 6 - 311+g@xmath27 level .",
    "the standard scaling is applied to the frequencies by employing a scale factor of @xmath40.9688 ( borowski 2012 ) .",
    "yang et al .  (",
    "2013 ) have carried out computations for seven methylated pah molecules with the b3lyp method in conjunction with a variety of basis sets .",
    "these basis sets , in order of increasing computational demand and accuracy , are 6 - 31g@xmath28 , 6 - 31+g@xmath28 , 6 - 311+g@xmath28 , 6 - 311g@xmath27 , 6 - 31+g@xmath27 , 6 - 31++g@xmath27 , 6 - 311+g@xmath27 , 6 - 311++g@xmath27 , 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) , and 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) . the second - order m@xmath29ller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 )",
    "is widely considered to be more accurate than b3lyp in computing band intensities ( see cramer et al .",
    "2004 ) . to examine the accuracy of the b3lyp method , yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have performed calculations with b3lyp and mp2 , using the most extensive basis set 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) for both methods .",
    "it is found that the results computed from b3lyp/6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) closely agree with that from mp2/6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) . on the other hand , yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have also found that the results computed with the b3lyp method combined with the four most sophisticated basis sets 6 - 311+g@xmath27 , 6 - 311++g@xmath27 , 6 - 311+g(3df,3pd ) , and 6 - 311++g(3df,3pd ) essentially reach the convergence limit .",
    "the b3lyp/6 - 311+g@xmath27 method therefore presents an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational demand .",
    "therefore , in this work we adopt the b3lyp/6 - 311+g@xmath27 method .",
    "all of the molecules shown in figure  [ fig : longsidechain ] are studied at the b3lyp/6 - 311+g@xmath27 level .",
    "they cover a wide range of sidegroups , including ethyl ( ch@xmath19ch@xmath20 ) , propyl ( ch@xmath19ch@xmath19ch@xmath20 ) , butyl ( ch@xmath19ch@xmath19ch@xmath19ch@xmath20 ) , and several unsaturated alkyl groups and spacers ( ch = ch@xmath19 , ch = ch , c = ch@xmath19 , c = c  h ) .",
    "most of the structures shown in figure  [ fig : longsidechain ] are unremarkable and planar or very close to planar",
    ". molecular models of the structures with significant twists around the ( alkene)c  c(arene ) bonds are shown in figure  [ fig : optimstruct ] in two perspectives .",
    "the computed total energies and the thermochemical parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : e_thermpara_longchain ] for the minima .    the vibrational frequencies and intensities for the aromatic and the aliphatic c ",
    "h stretching modes were computed .",
    "the computed intensities are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : a33a34_sidegroup_all ] .",
    "we can see that the aliphatic c  h stretch band strength varies within a wide range . for ethyl , propyl and butyl , the values ( @xmath2@xmath42530@xmath30 ) are generally consistent with methyl pahs for which the aliphatic c  h stretch band strength has an average value ( per aliphatic c  h bond ) of @xmath31 , with a standard deviation of @xmath32 ( see yang et al .",
    "in contrast , the aliphatic c  h stretch strengths for the unsaturated alkyl chains ( ch = ch@xmath19 , ch = ch , c = ch@xmath19 , c = c  h ) are much lower ( @xmath2@xmath4515@xmath30 ) . on the other hand , the aromatic c  h stretch band strength stays stable for all the groups , @xmath1@xmath41015@xmath30 , which is also consistent with methyl pahs for which the aromatic c  h stretch band strength has an average value ( per aromatic c  h bond ) of @xmath33 , with a standard deviation of @xmath34 ( see yang et al .",
    "2013 ) . therefore ,",
    "as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : a33a34_sidegroup_all ] , we conclude that , with @xmath35 , the @xmath3 ratios for pahs with ethyl , propyl and butyl groups are close to that of methyl pahs for which @xmath36 ( see yang et al .",
    "the @xmath3 ratios for pahs with unsaturated alkyl chains ( @xmath37 ) are lower by a factor of @xmath42 than that of methyl pahs . with the ratios of the intrinsic band strengths @xmath3 computed",
    ", we can estimate the ratio of the number of c atoms in aliphatic units to that in aromatic rings in the uie carriers from @xmath16 .",
    "yang et al .  (",
    "2013 ) have compiled and analyzed the observed uie spectra of 35 sources reported in the literature which display both the 3.3@xmath0 and 3.4@xmath0 c  h features .",
    "these sources include ppne , pne , reflection nebulae , hii regions , and photodissociated regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "yang et al .  (",
    "2013 ) derived a median ratio of @xmath38 , with the majority ( 31/35 ) of these sources having @xmath39 . with an average bond strength ratio of @xmath40 derived here for pahs with ethyl , propyl and butyl sidegroups",
    ", we obtain @xmath41 .",
    "even if we adopt @xmath42 which is derived for pahs with unsaturated alkyl chains , the aliphatic fraction is still only @xmath43 .",
    "this suggests that , in agreement of the earlier findings of li & draine ( 2012 ) and yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the uie emitters are predominantly aromatic .",
    "an aliphatic component is indeed present , as revealed by the 3.4@xmath0 c  h stretch , but it is only a very minor part of the uie emitters .    more recently , mori et al .  ( 2014 ) obtained the @xmath42.55.4@xmath0 emission spectra of 36 galactic hii regions ( or hii region - like objects ) with the _ infrared camera _ ( irc ) on board _ akari _ ( onaka et al .",
    "they determined the 3.4@xmath44m - to-3.3@xmath44 m band ratios @xmath45 in a uniform manner for all 36 hii regions and derived an average ratio of @xmath46 ( t.  onaka 2016 , private communication ) , which is @xmath42.1 times that of yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ; @xmath38 ) .",
    "again , the 3.4@xmath0 feature intensity @xmath47 includes the contributions from the weak satellite features at @xmath43.43.5@xmath0 . for the uie carriers in these hii regions , the aliphatic content will be higher : @xmath48 if one adopts the @xmath3 ratios derived for pahs with ethyl , propyl and butyl groups ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) , or @xmath50 if one adopts the @xmath3 ratios derived for pahs with unsaturated alkyl chains ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) .",
    "apparently , in either case the uir carriers are still largely aromatic .    in view that several alkyl side chains might be present in one pah molecule",
    ", we also consider the situation that there are two methyl groups attached to a pah molecule , using pyrene as an example .",
    "we consider all possible isomers of dimethyl - substituted pyrene ( see figure  [ fig : pyrene_dimethyl ] ) .",
    "for dimethyl pyrenes , as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : a34a33_dimethyl_all ] , the aliphatic c  h stretch band strength varies within @xmath2@xmath41827@xmath30 , while these values for the aromatic c  h stretch are generally @xmath1@xmath415@xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath3 ratios , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : a34a33_dimethyl_all ] , vary from @xmath41.25 ( pyre110 ) to @xmath41.75 ( pyre27 ) , with an average ratio of @xmath51 , which is only @xmath411% lower than the mean ratio of @xmath52 computed from methyl pahs ( see yang et al .",
    "2013 ) . with @xmath38 ( yang et al .",
    "2013 ) or @xmath53 ( mori et al .",
    "2014 ) , we derive the aliphatic fraction of the uie carriers from @xmath54 to be @xmath55 or @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "we also find that the methyl groups are essentially independent of each other .",
    "noticeable effects on frequency and intensity only occur when several alkyl groups are placed in direct proximity .",
    "we note that for methyl pahs the frequencies of the aliphatic c  h stretch are always smaller than @xmath43000@xmath57 and those for the aromatic c  h stretch are larger than @xmath43000@xmath57 .",
    "the positions of the c  h stretches of simple alkenes and dienes coincide with the methyl signals of methyl - substituted pahs .",
    "however , for ch = ch@xmath19 and c = ch@xmath19 , one of the aliphatic c  h stretches falls at @xmath43120@xmath57 ( i.e , in the `` aromatic '' region ) . for dimethyl",
    "pyrene pyre45 , there is also one frequency of the aliphatic c",
    " h stretches that falls in the `` aromatic '' region ( @xmath43070@xmath57 ) .",
    "we note that although the 3.4@xmath0 _ emission _ feature is always much weaker than the 3.3@xmath0 _ emission _ feature in most of the uie sources ( except several ppne , see geballe 1997 , tokunaga 1997 ) , the opposite is seen in _ absorption_. a broad _ absorption _ feature at 3.4@xmath0 , ubiquitously seen in the diffuse ism of the milky way and external galaxies ( see sandford et al .  1991 , 1995 , pendleton et al .",
    "1994 , pendleton & allamandola 2002 ) , is generally attributed to _",
    "solid _ aliphatic hydrocarbon dust .",
    "it is much broader than the 3.4@xmath0 _ emission _ feature seen in the uie sources ( see figure  1 in li & draine 2012 ) , supporting the _ bulk , solid _ nature of the carriers of the 3.4@xmath0 absorption feature . in some sources",
    "the 3.4@xmath0 absorption feature is accompanied by a weaker 3.3@xmath0 _ absorption _ feature ( e.g. , in the galactic center source gcs 3 , the 3.3@xmath0 absorption feature is weaker than the predominant 3.4@xmath0 feature by a factor of @xmath435 , see chiar et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the 3.4@xmath0 _ absorption _ feature of the diffuse ism consists of three substructures at @xmath43.38 , 3.42 , 3.48@xmath0 ( corresponding to @xmath42955 , 2925 , 2870@xmath57 ) which respectively arises from the asymmetric c  h stretches of the ch@xmath20 and ch@xmath58 functional groups and the symmetric c  h stretch of the ch@xmath20 groups in saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon materials ( see pendleton & allamandola 2002 ) .",
    "some sources also exhibit a subfeature at @xmath43.51@xmath0 ( corresponding to @xmath42850@xmath57 ) , attributed to the symmetric c  h stretch of the ch@xmath58 groups .",
    "pendleton & allamandola ( 2002 ) derived an abundance ratio of ch@xmath58/ch@xmath20@xmath59 , suggesting that the aliphatic hydrocarbon materials contain structures like ch@xmath19ch@xmath19ch@xmath20 and ch@xmath19ch@xmath19ch@xmath19ch@xmath20 .",
    "however , it is more complicated to infer the possible structures of the aliphatic components of the uie carriers from the relative strengths of the 3.4@xmath0 emission feature and its associated satellite features at 3.43 , 3.46 , 3.51 and 3.56@xmath0 .",
    "this is because the 3.4@xmath0 emission feature and its satellite features could also be due to superhydrogenation ( bernstein et al .",
