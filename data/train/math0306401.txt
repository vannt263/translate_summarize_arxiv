    "a @xmath4-transversal to a family of convex sets in @xmath5 is an affine subspace of dimension @xmath4 ( e.g.  a point , line , plane , or hyperplane ) that intersects every member of the family .",
    "goodman , pollack , and wenger  @xcite and wenger  @xcite provide two extensive surveys of the rich subject of geometric transversal theory . in this paper , we are interested in @xmath6-transversals ( also called line transversals , or simply transversals ) to line segments . in @xmath7 , this topic was studied in the 1980 s by edelsbrunner at al .",
    "@xcite ; here we study the topic in @xmath1 .",
    "we address the following basic question .",
    "what is the geometry and cardinality of the set of transversals to an arbitrary collection of @xmath0 line segments in @xmath1 ? here a segment may be open , semi - open , or closed , and it may degenerate to a point ; segments may intersect or even overlap . since a line in @xmath1 has four degrees of freedom , it can intersect at most four lines or line segments in generic position .",
    "conversely , it is well - known that four lines or line segments in generic position admit @xmath8 or @xmath9 transversals ; moreover , @xmath10 arbitrary lines in @xmath1 admit @xmath11 or infinitely many transversals  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our work shows that @xmath10 arbitrary line segments admit up to @xmath10 or infinitely many transversals .",
    "our interest in line transversals to segments in @xmath1 is motivated by visibility problems . in computer graphics and robotics ,",
    "scenes are often represented as unions of not necessarily disjoint polygonal or polyhedral objects",
    ". the objects that can be seen in a particular direction from a moving viewpoint may change when the line of sight becomes tangent to one or more objects in the scene . since the line of sight then becomes a transversal to a subset of the edges of the polygons and polyhedra representing the scene , questions about transversals to segments arise very naturally in this context .    as an example , the visibility complex  @xcite and its visibility skeleton  @xcite are data structures that encode visibility information of a scene ; an edge of these structures corresponds to a set of segments lying in line transversals to some @xmath4 edges of the scene .",
    "generically in @xmath1 , @xmath4 is equal to @xmath12 but in degenerate configurations @xmath4 can be arbitrarily large . such degenerate configurations frequently arise in realistic scenes ; as an example a group of chairs may admit infinitely many lines tangent to arbitrarily many of them .",
    "it is thus essential for computing these data structures to characterize and compute the transversals to @xmath4 segments in @xmath1 .",
    "also , to bound the size of the visibility complex one needs to bound the number of connected components of transversals to @xmath4 arbitrary line segments .",
    "while the answer @xmath13 suffices for giving asymptotic results , the present paper establishes the actual bound .",
    "as mentioned above , in the context of 3d visibility , lines tangent to objects are more relevant than transversals ; lines tangent to a polygon or polyhedron along an edge happen to be transversals to this edge .",
    "( for bounds on the space of transversals to convex polyhedra in @xmath1 see  @xcite . )",
    "the literature related to lines tangent to objects falls into two categories .",
    "the one closest to our work deals with characterizing the degenerate configurations of curved objects with respect to tangent lines .",
    "macdonald , pach and theobald  @xcite give a complete description of the set of lines tangent to four unit balls in @xmath1 .",
    "megyesi , sottile and theobald  @xcite describe the set of lines meeting two lines and tangent to two spheres in  @xmath1 , or tangent to two quadrics in @xmath14 .",
    "megyesi and sottile  @xcite describe the set of lines meeting one line and tangent to two or three spheres in  @xmath1 .",
    "a nice survey of these results can be found in  @xcite .    the other category of results deals with lines tangent to @xmath4 among @xmath0 objects in @xmath1 . for polyhedral objects ,",
    "de berg , everett and guibas  @xcite showed a @xmath15 lower bound on the number of free ( i.e. , non - occluded by the interior of any object ) lines tangent to @xmath10 amongst @xmath0 disjoint homothetic convex polyhedra .",
    "brnnimann et al .",
    "@xcite showed that , under a certain general position assumption , the number of lines tangent to @xmath10 amongst @xmath4 bounded disjoint convex polyhedra of total complexity @xmath0 is @xmath16 .",
    "for curved objects , devillers et al .",
    "@xcite and devillers and ramos  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) presented simple @xmath17 and @xmath15 lower bounds on the number of free maximal segments tangent to @xmath10 amongst @xmath0 unit balls and amongst @xmath0 arbitrarily sized balls .",
    "agarwal , aronov and sharir  @xcite showed an upper bound of @xmath18 on the complexity of the space of line transversals of @xmath0 balls by studying the lower envelope of a set of functions ; a study of the upper envelope of the same set of functions yields the same upper bound on the number of free lines tangent to four balls  @xcite .",
    "durand et al .",
    "@xcite showed an upper bound of @xmath19 on the expected number of possibly occluded lines tangent to @xmath10 among @xmath0 uniformly distributed unit balls . under the same model , devillers et al .",
    "@xcite recently showed a bound of @xmath20 on the number maximal free line segments tangent to @xmath10 among @xmath0 balls .",
    "we say that two transversals to a collection of line segments are in the same _ connected component _ if and only if one can be continuously moved into the other while remaining a transversal to the collection of line segments .",
    "equivalently , the two points in line space ( e.g. , in plcker space ) corresponding to the two transversals are in the same connected component of the set of points corresponding to all the transversals to the collection of line segments .",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ t : main ] a collection of @xmath2 arbitrary line segments in @xmath1 admits @xmath3 or infinitely many transversals . in the latter case , the transversals can form any number , from @xmath6 up to @xmath0 inclusive , of connected components .",
    "more precisely we show that , when @xmath21 , there can be more than @xmath9 transversals only if the segments are in some degenerate configuration , namely if the @xmath0 segments are members of one ruling of a hyperbolic paraboloid or a hyperboloid of one sheet , or if they are concurrent , or if they all lie in a plane with the possible exception of a group of one or more segments that all meet that plane at the same point .",
    "moreover , in these degenerate configurations the number of connected components of transversals is as follows . if the segments are members of one ruling of a hyperbolic paraboloid , or if they are concurrent , their transversals form at most one connected component .",
    "if they are members of one ruling of a hyperboloid of one sheet , or if they are coplanar , their transversals can have up to @xmath0 connected components ( see figures  [ f : interval ] and [ f : coplanar ] ) . finally ,",
    "if the segments all lie in a plane with the exception of a group of one or more segments that all meet that plane at the same point , their transversals can form up to @xmath22 connected components ( see figures  [ f : triangle ] and [ fig : example - with-3-connected - components ] ) .",
    "the geometry of the transversals is as follows .",
    "we consider here @xmath21 segments that are pairwise non - collinear ; otherwise , as we shall see in section  [ sec : proof ] , we can replace segments having the same supporting line by their common intersection . if the segments are members of one ruling of a hyperbolic paraboloid or a hyperboloid of one sheet , their transversals lie in the other ruling ( see figures  [ f : interval ] and [ fig : hyperbolic - paraboloid ] ) .",
    "if the segments are concurrent at a point @xmath23 , their transversals consist of the lines through @xmath23 and , if the segments also lie in a plane @xmath24 , of lines in @xmath24 .",
    "if the segments consist of a group segments lying in a plane @xmath24 and meeting at a point @xmath23 , together with a group of one or more segments meeting @xmath24 at a point @xmath25 and lying in a plane @xmath26 containing @xmath23 , their transversals lie in @xmath24 and @xmath26 ( see figure  [ fig : example - with-3-connected - components ] ) .",
    "finally , if none of the previous conditions holds and if the segments all lie in a plane @xmath24 with the possible exception of a group of one or more segments that all meet @xmath24 at the same point , then their transversals lie in @xmath24 ( see figures  [ f : triangle ] and [ f : coplanar ] ) .",
    "if all the @xmath0 segments are coplanar , the set of connected components of transversals , as well as any one of these components , can be of linear complexity  @xcite .",
    "otherwise we prove that each of the connected components has constant complexity and can be represented by an interval on a line or on a circle ( or possibly by two intervals in the case depicted in figure  [ fig : example - with-3-connected - components ] ) .",
    "a connected component of transversals may be an isolated line .",
    "for example , three segments forming a triangle and a fourth segment intersecting the interior of the triangle in one point have exactly three transversals ( figure  [ f : triangle ] shows a similar example with infinitely many transversals ) .",
    "also , the four segments in figure  [ f : interval ] can be shortened so that the four connected components of transversals reduce to four isolated transversals .    finally , as discussed in the conclusion ,",
    "an @xmath27-time algorithm for computing the transversals to @xmath0 segments directly follows from the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "every non - degenerate line segment is contained in its _ supporting line_. we define the supporting line of a point to be the vertical line through that point .",
    "we prove theorem  [ t : main ] by considering the three following cases which cover all possibilities but are not exclusive .    1 .",
    "three supporting lines are pairwise skew .",
    "2 .   two supporting lines are coplanar .",
    "3 .   all the segments are coplanar .",
    "we can assume in what follows that _ the supporting lines are pairwise distinct .",
    "_ indeed , if disjoint segments have the same supporting line @xmath29 , then @xmath29 is the only transversal to those segments , and so the set of transversals is either empty or consists of @xmath29 . if non - disjoint segments have the same supporting line , then any transversal must meet the intersection of the segments .",
    "we can replace these overlapping segments by their common intersection .",
    "three pairwise skew lines lie on a unique doubly - ruled hyperboloid , namely , a hyperbolic paraboloid or a hyperboloid of one sheet ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , they are members of one ruling , say the `` first '' ruling , and their transversals are the lines in the `` second '' ruling that are not parallel to any of the three given skew lines .",
    "consider first the case where there exists a fourth segment whose supporting line @xmath29 does not lie in the first ruling .",
    "either @xmath29 is not contained in the hyperboloid or it lies in the second ruling . in both cases , there are at most two transversals to the four supporting lines , which are lines of the second ruling that meet or coincide with @xmath29 ( see figure  [ fig : hyperbolic - paraboloid ] )  @xcite .",
    "thus there are at most two transversals to the @xmath0 line segments .",

    ". the lines in the second ruling can be parameterized by their intersection points with any line @xmath37 of the first ruling .",
    "thus the set of lines in the second ruling that meet a segment @xmath36 corresponds to an interval on line @xmath37 .",
    "hence the set of transversals to the @xmath0 segments corresponds to the intersection of @xmath0 intervals on @xmath37 , that is , to one interval on this line , and so the transversals form one connected component .",
    "consider finally the case where the @xmath2 supporting lines lie in the first ruling of a hyperboloid of one sheet ( see figure  [ f : interval ] ) .",
    "the lines in the second ruling can be parameterized by points on a circle , for instance , by their intersection points with a circle lying on the hyperboloid of one sheet .",
    "thus the set of transversals to the @xmath0 segments corresponds to the intersection of @xmath0 intervals on this circle .",
    "this intersection can have any number of connected components from @xmath8 up to @xmath0 and any of these connected components may consist of an isolated point on the circle .",
    "the set of transversals can thus have any number of connected components from @xmath8 up to @xmath0 and any of these connected components may consist of an isolated transversal .",
    "figure  [ f : interval ] shows two views of a configuration with @xmath38 line segments having @xmath10 connected components of transversals .",
    "in this section we have proved that if the supporting lines of @xmath2 line segments lie in one ruling of a hyperboloid of one sheet , the segments admit @xmath3 or infinitely many transversals which form up to @xmath0 connected components .",
    "if supporting lines lie in one ruling of a hyperbolic paraboloid , the segments admit at most @xmath6 connected component of transversals .",
    "otherwise the segments admit up to @xmath9 transversals .",

    "now suppose that @xmath32 and @xmath30 intersect at point @xmath23 .",

    "if no such line exists then all segments are coplanar ; see section  [ sec : coplanar ] . if such lines exist and any of them is parallel to @xmath24 then all transversals to the @xmath0 segments lie in the plane containing @xmath23 and that line",
    ". we can again replace each segment by its intersection with that plane to obtain a set of coplanar segments , a configuration treated in section  [ sec : coplanar ] .",
    "we can now assume that there exists a supporting line not in @xmath24 .",
    "suppose that all the supporting lines not in @xmath24 go through @xmath23 .",
    "if all the segments lying in these supporting lines contain @xmath23 then we may replace all these segments by the point @xmath23 without changing the set of transversals to the @xmath0 segments .",
    "then all resulting segments are coplanar , a configuration treated in section  [ sec : coplanar ] . now",
    "if some segment @xmath39 does not contain @xmath23 then the only possible transversal to the @xmath0 segments is the line containing @xmath39 and @xmath23 .",
    "we can now assume that there exists a supporting line @xmath31 intersecting @xmath24 in exactly one point @xmath40 distinct from @xmath23 ( see figure  [ fig : two - lines - meet ] ) .",

    "any transversal to the lines @xmath32 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 lies in @xmath26 and goes through @xmath23 , or lies in @xmath24 and goes through @xmath40 .    @xmath41    if there exists a segment @xmath39 that lies neither in @xmath24 nor in @xmath26 and goes through neither @xmath23 nor @xmath40 , then there are at most two transversals to the @xmath0 segments , namely , at most one line in @xmath26 through @xmath23 and @xmath39 and at most one line in @xmath24 through @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "we can thus assume that all segments lie in @xmath24 or @xmath26 or go through @xmath23 or @xmath40 .",

    "indeed , no line in @xmath26 through @xmath23 intersects @xmath39 except possibly the line @xmath42 which also lies in @xmath24 .",
    "we can again replace each segment by its intersection with @xmath24 to obtain a set of coplanar segments ; see section  [ sec : coplanar ] .",
    "the case where @xmath39 lies in @xmath26 is similar .",
    "@xmath43    we can now assume that all segments go through @xmath23 or @xmath40 ( or both ) .",
    "let @xmath44 be the number of segments not containing @xmath23 , and @xmath45 be the number of segments not containing @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath46 .    among the lines in @xmath24 through @xmath40 ,",
    "the transversals to the @xmath0 segments are the transversals to the @xmath47 segments not containing @xmath40 .",
    "we can replace these @xmath47 segments by their intersections with @xmath24 to obtain a set of @xmath47 coplanar segments in @xmath24 .",
    "the transversals to these segments in @xmath24 through @xmath40 can form up to @xmath47 connected components .",
    "indeed , the lines in @xmath24 through @xmath40 can be parameterized by a point on a circle , for instance , by their polar angle in @xmath48 .",
    "thus the set of lines in @xmath24 through @xmath40 and through a segment in @xmath24 corresponds to an interval of @xmath48 .",
    "hence the set of transversals to the @xmath47 segments corresponds to the intersection of @xmath47 intervals in @xmath48 which can have up to @xmath47 connected components .",
    "similarly , the lines in @xmath26 through @xmath23 that are transversals to the @xmath0 segments can form up to @xmath49 connected components .",
    "note furthermore that the line @xmath42 is a transversal to all segments and that the connected component of transversals that contains the line @xmath42 is counted twice .",
    "hence there are at most @xmath50 connected components of transversals to the @xmath0 segments .    to see that the bound of @xmath22 connected components is reached , first consider @xmath51 lines in @xmath24 through @xmath23 , but not through @xmath40 .",
    "their transversals through @xmath40 are all the lines in @xmath24 though @xmath40 , except for the lines that are parallel to any of the @xmath51 given lines .",
    "this gives @xmath51 connected components .",
    "shrinking the @xmath51 lines to sufficiently long segments still gives @xmath51 connected components of transversals in @xmath24 through @xmath40 .",
    "the same construction in plane @xmath26 gives @xmath51 connected components of transversals in @xmath26 through @xmath23 .",
    "this gives @xmath22 connected components of transversals to the @xmath0 segments since the component containing line @xmath42 is counted twice .",
    "figure  [ fig : example - with-3-connected - components ] shows an example of @xmath10 segments having @xmath12 connected components of transversals .    in this section",
    "we have proved that @xmath2 segments having at least two coplanar supporting lines either can be reduced to @xmath0 coplanar segments or may have up to @xmath22 connected components of transversals .",
    "@xmath52      we prove here that @xmath2 coplanar line segments in @xmath1 admit up to @xmath0 connected components of transversals .",
    "let @xmath24 be the plane containing all the @xmath0 segments .",
    "there exists a transversal not in @xmath24 if and only if all segments are concurrent at a point @xmath23 . in this case , the transversals consist of the lines through @xmath23 together with the transversals lying in @xmath24 . to see that they form only one connected component ,",
    "notice that any transversal in @xmath24 can be translated to @xmath23 while remaining a transversal throughout the translation .",
    "we thus can assume in the following that all transversals lie in @xmath24 , and we consider the problem in @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the usual geometric transform ( see e.g. @xcite ) where a line in @xmath7 with equation @xmath53 is mapped to the point @xmath54 in the dual space .",
    "the transversals to a segment are transformed to a double wedge ; the double wedge degenerates to a line when the segment is a point .",
    "the apex of the double wedge is the dual of the line containing the segment .",
    "a transversal to the @xmath0 segments is represented in the dual by a point in the intersection of all the double wedges .",
    "there are at most @xmath55 connected components of such points  @xcite ( see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 15.3 ) ) .",
    "indeed , each double wedge consists of two wedges separated by the vertical line through the apex .",
    "the intersection of all the double wedges thus consists of at most @xmath55 convex regions whose interiors are separated by at most @xmath0 vertical lines .",
    "notice that if there are exactly @xmath55 convex regions then two of these regions are connected at infinity by the dual of some vertical line , in which case the segments have a vertical transversal .",
    "thus the number of connected components of transversals is at most  @xmath0 .    to see that this bound is sharp",
    "consider the configuration in figure  [ f : coplanar ] of @xmath10 segments having @xmath10 components of transversals .",
    "three of the components consist of isolated lines and one consists of a connected set of lines through @xmath23 ( shaded in the figure ) .",
    "observe that the line segment @xmath56 meets the three isolated lines .",
    "thus the set of transversals to the four initial segments and segment @xmath57 consists of the @xmath12 previously mentioned isolated transversals , the line @xmath58 which is isolated , and a connected set of lines through @xmath23 .",
    "this may be repeated for any number of additional segments , giving configurations of @xmath0 coplanar line segments with @xmath0 connected components of transversals .",
    "this paper has characterized the geometry , cardinality and complexity of the set of transversals to an arbitrary collection of line segments in @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to contributing to geometric transversal theory , we anticipate that the results will be useful in the design of geometric algorithms and in their running time analyses .",
    "while algorithmic issues have not been the main concern of the paper , we note that the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] leads to an @xmath27-time algorithm in the real ram model of computation .",
    "first reduce in @xmath60 ) time the set of segments to the case of pairwise distinct supporting lines .",
    "choose any three of these lines .",
    "either they are pairwise skew or two of them are coplanar . if they are pairwise skew ( see section  [ sec : case1 ] ) , their transversals , and hence the transversals to all @xmath0 segments , lie in one ruling of a hyperboloid .",
    "any segment that intersects the hyperboloid in at most two points admits at most @xmath9 transversals that lie in that ruling . checking whether these lines are transversals to the @xmath0 segments",
    "can be done in linear time .",
    "consider now the case of a segment that lies on the hyperboloid .",
    "its set of transversals , lying in the ruling , can be parameterized in constant time by an interval on a line or a circle depending on the type of the hyperboloid .",
    "computing the transversals to the @xmath0 segments thus reduces in linear time to intersecting @xmath0 intervals on a line or on a circle , which can be done in @xmath27 time .",
    "if two supporting lines are coplanar ( see section  [ sec : case2 ] ) , computing the transversals to the @xmath0 segments reduces in linear time to computing transversals to at most @xmath0 segments in one or two planes , which can be done in @xmath27 time  @xcite .    finally , note that we did not consider in this paper , for simplicity of the exposition , lines or half - lines although our theorem holds when such lines in @xmath1 are allowed .",
    "note for example that , in @xmath1 , the transversals to @xmath2 lines of one ruling of a hyperboloid of one sheet are all the lines of the other ruling with the exception of the lines parallel to the @xmath0 given lines .",
    "thus , in @xmath1 , the transversals form @xmath0 connected components .",
    "remark however that our theorem does not hold for lines in projective space @xmath14 ; in this case , our proof directly yields that , if a set of lines admit infinitely many transversals , they form one connected component .",
