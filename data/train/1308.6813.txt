    "one of the more ubiquitous concepts in enumerative combinatorics is unimodality , as a large number of common combinatorial functions have this property ( see stanley s survey articles @xcite for many examples and applications ) . in particular , a _ unimodal sequence of size @xmath0 _ is a sequence of positive integers that sum to @xmath0 such that the terms are monotonically increasing until a peak is reached , after which the terms are monotonically decreasing .",
    "this means that the sequence can be written in terms of parts @xmath1 that satisfy the inequalities @xmath2 when writing examples of unimodal sequences , we typically write the sequences without commas in order to save space .",
    "for example , @xmath3 is a unimodal sequence of size @xmath4 , and all of the unimodal sequences of size @xmath5 are concisely listed as follows : @xmath6    this simple combinatorial definition and its variants have also appeared in the literature under many other names and contexts , including `` stacks '' @xcite , `` convex compositions '' @xcite , integer partitions @xcite , and in the study of `` saw - toothed '' crystal surfaces in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is also appropriate to mention the closely related concept of `` concave compositions '' , which were studied in @xcite , although we will not further discuss these sequences .",
    "the purposes of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we concisely review previous work on enumeration functions related to stacks , unimodal sequences , and compositions , including the corresponding generating functions , and their asymptotic behavior when known .",
    "second , we provide new asymptotic formulas that successfully fill in the notable missing cases from the literature . along the way we describe some of the analytic techniques that were used in proving the previously known asymptotic formulas , including the theory of modular forms , euler - maclaurin summation , and tauberian theorems ; broadly speaking , these methods allow us to use the analytic properties of generating series in order to determine the asymptotic behavior of their coefficients . in order to prove the new asymptotic formulas",
    ", we also introduce additional techniques such as the constant term method and saddle point method , which have been less widely used in this combinatorial setting .    before presenting the definitions of the many variants of unimodal sequences",
    ", we first highlight a potential ambiguity in the enumeration of sequences that satisfy and .",
    "in particular , if the largest part is not unique , then there are multiple choices for the `` summit '' @xmath7 .",
    "there are therefore two natural enumeration functions , as these choices may or may not be counted distinctly , and the majority of the enumeration functions thus occur in closely related pairs , corresponding to whether or not the summit is distinguished . for the first type of enumeration function , we canonically choose the summit @xmath7 to be the last instance of the largest part in the sequence .",
    "we now describe the various enumeration functions for unimodal sequences , adopting wright s terminology as much as possible  we refer to all examples as `` stacks '' of various types , and we represent unimodal sequences visually by diagrams in which a sequence of blocks are stacked in columns .",
    "the first definition is that of a _ stack _ , which is simply a unimodal sequence with @xmath8 ; this means that each distinct sequence is counted once , without regard to the multiplicity of the largest part . following wright s notation in @xcite ,",
    "we denote the number of stacks of size @xmath0 by @xmath9 ( this function has also been called @xmath10 in the enumeration of `` type b partitions '' found in @xcite , and @xmath11 in section 2.5 of @xcite ) .    following the alternative method of enumeration , a _ stack with summit _ is defined to be a stack in which one of the largest parts is marked ( this represents the possible different choices of @xmath7 in and ) . in other words , we distinguish between stacks in which a different instance of the largest part is marked as the summit .",
    "we write the enumeration function for stacks with summits of size @xmath0 as @xmath12 ; this is also found as @xmath13 in section 3 of @xcite , as @xmath14 in the study of `` v - partitions '' in section 2.5 of @xcite , and as @xmath15 in @xcite , where andrews definition of `` convex compositions '' ( which implicitly have a unique largest part ) is equivalent to stacks with summits , up to a minor normalization .",
    "for example , the stacks of size @xmath5 were listed previously , and if we represent the marked parts as overlined , then the stacks with summits of size @xmath5 are @xmath16 so @xmath17 and @xmath18 see figures [ f : stack ] and [ f : stacksummit ] for examples of the diagrams of stacks and stacks with summits .",
    "the relevant generating functions , which first appeared in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , are @xmath19 here we have used the standard notation for @xmath20-factorials , namely @xmath21 for @xmath22 . in order to understand these generating functions , observe that the @xmath23th term generates all stacks ( respectively , stacks with summits ) with largest part exactly @xmath23 .",
    "the next definition is that of a _ receding stack _",
    ", which must satisfy and as well as the additional conditions @xmath24 in other words , the collections of @xmath25s and @xmath26s must both contain each part size from @xmath27 to @xmath28 at least once . also , as in the case of stacks above , we further require @xmath8 for this first type of enumeration function . again following wright @xcite",
    ", we denote the number of receding stacks of size @xmath0 by @xmath29 ( also written as @xmath30 in the enumeration of `` type a partitions '' in @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , a _ receding stack with summit _ distinguishes one of the largest parts with a mark , and we denote the corresponding enumeration function by @xmath31 .    for example , the receding stacks of size @xmath5 are @xmath32 and the receding stacks with summits of size @xmath5 are @xmath33 so @xmath34 and @xmath35 the generating functions for receding stacks ( resp . with summits ) are @xmath36 the generating function for @xmath29 was first given in @xcite , but to our knowledge , receding stacks with summits have not previously been described .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that is better known as the generating function for @xmath37 , euler s integer partition function , which has been widely studied in its own right @xcite .",
    "we will describe the combinatorial relationship between partitions and receding stacks with summits in greater detail later in this paper .",
    "continuing with the definitions , a _ shifted stack _ is a sequence that satisfies , , and , with the additional condition @xmath8 .",
    "although this definition might also naturally be called `` left - receding stacks '' , the terminology is inspired by auluck s @xcite and wright s @xcite observations that if each row is shifted left by half of a cell , then this is combinatorially equivalent to counting stacks of coins , or circular logs , with a single `` peak '' . see figure [ f : shifted ] for an example of a shifted stack represented by both types of diagrams ( cf . figure 2 in auluck s original work @xcite ) .",
    "the number of shifted stacks of size @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath38 as in @xcite ( this function is also found as @xmath39 in the enumeration of `` type c partitions '' in @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , a _ shifted stack with summit _ is a shifted stack with a distinguished occurrence of the largest part , and the enumeration function is now denoted by @xmath40 ; these stacks previously appeared in section 3 of @xcite , where they were referred to as `` gradual stacks with summits '' , with enumeration function @xmath41 .",
    "for example , the shifted stacks of size @xmath5 are @xmath42 and the shifted stacks with summits of size @xmath5 are @xmath43 so @xmath44 and @xmath45 the generating functions for the two types of shifted stacks are first found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and are given by @xmath46    the final variants that we discuss in this paper were introduced by andrews in @xcite , where he studied `` strict convex compositions '' .",
    "we therefore define a _ strict stack _ to be a stack in which all of the inequalities in and are strict , and write the enumeration function as @xmath47 ( this appeared as @xmath48 in @xcite , and as the enumeration function @xmath49 for `` strict unimodal sequences '' in @xcite ) . furthermore , a",
    "_ semi - strict stack _ ( or `` left - strict '' ) requires strict inequalities only in , with the additional condition that the largest value is unique , so @xmath50 we denote the enumeration function for semi - strict stacks by @xmath51 ( this was denoted by @xmath52 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that the summits are already unique for strict and semi - strict stacks , so there are not enumeration functions of the second type .",
    "for example , the strict stacks of size @xmath5 are @xmath53 and the semi - strict stacks of size @xmath5 are @xmath54 so @xmath55 and @xmath56 the generating function for strict and semi - strict stacks are also found in @xcite , and are given by @xmath57    all of the previously known asymptotic results for stacks are listed in table [ tab : stack ] .",
    "it is important to point out that in many cases the enumeration function is known to much greater precision than its main asymptotic term ; this includes the full asymptotic expansion for @xmath29 and @xmath38 @xcite , an exact formula for @xmath31 @xcite , and an asymptotic series with polynomial error for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the asterisks in the second row indicate that in the case of @xmath12 the asymptotic formula is not explicitly stated in either of the references , but can be obtained by combining stanley and wright s results . for completeness , the details and further context are discussed later in section [ s : summit ] of this paper .",
    ".previous asymptotic formulas for stack enumeration functions , where the main asymptotic term is written in the form @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "see section [ s : summit ] for more details on how the formula for @xmath12 follows from @xcite and @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : stack ]    our new results fill in the missing values and incomplete rows of table [ tab : stack ] .",
    "these missing cases are of longstanding interest , as they represent some of the earliest examples of unimodal enumeration problems , and have inspired much of the subsequent work in the area .",
    "indeed , shifted stacks were first introduced in temperley s original study of boundary cases for rectangular arrays in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "auluck then investigated @xmath38 at temperley s request @xcite , and proved that the exponential order lay in the bounded range @xmath60 .",
    "the study was subsequently taken up by wright @xcite , who improved the asymptotic analysis by finding the exact exponent , showing that @xmath61 our first result gives precise asymptotic formula for shifted stacks and shifted stacks with summits , which is a significant improvement over .",
    "we use the standard notation @xmath62 for the golden ratio .",
    "[ t : h ] as @xmath59 , we have the asymptotic formulae @xmath63    as pointed out to us by r. rhoades , ramanujan s last letter to hardy amazingly includes the generating function for shifted stacks with summits .",
    "although he did not discuss the coefficients , nor their combinatorial significance , ramanujan did provide the asymptotic expansion for the generating function ( as was often the case in ramanujan s work , he did not write his results in a strictly rigorous manner )",
    ". see @xcite and the further discussion in section [ s : shifted : summit ] of this paper for additional details .",
    "combined with the techniques discussed in section [ s : tauberian ] , ramanujan s result could also be used to prove the asymptotic formula for @xmath40 .",
    "however , we provide an additional proof of this case in section [ s : shifted ] , as our present techniques apply equally well to both formulas in theorem [ t : h ]",
    ".    our next result does not directly appear in table [ tab : stack ] , but is inspired by a closer investigation of the relationship between receding stacks with summits and integer partitions .",
    "we will review andrews definition of `` frobenius symbols '' in section [ s : partns : frob ] , but for the purposes of stating our result we simply denote the number of frobenius symbols of size @xmath0 with no zeros in the top row by @xmath64 we also define the notation @xmath65 for the number of frobenius symbols of size @xmath0 that _ do _ contain a zero in the top row .",
    "since there are exactly @xmath37 frobenius symbols of size @xmath0 ( again , see section [ s : partns : frob ] for definitions ) , we have @xmath66    the following theorem describes the asymptotic relationship between these two functions .",
    "[ t : frob ] as @xmath59 , @xmath67    in fact , the bijections in section [ s : partns ] further prove that @xmath68 .",
    "this means that theorem [ t : frob ] equivalently states that roughly half of all partitions ( according to the uniform measure on partitions up to a given size ) correspond to a frobenius symbol that does not contain a zero in the top row , just as the `` average '' receding stack has two copies of its largest part ( since @xmath69 ) .",
    "our final result fills in the last row of table [ tab : stack ] by giving a formula for semi - strict stacks . among the known results in table [ tab : stack ] , the case of strict stacks was perhaps the most difficult .",
    "the analysis for most of the other rows relied on some combination of combinatorial arguments , the transformation theory of ( modular ) theta functions , and/or the use of euler - maclaurin summation for asymptotic expansions .",
    "however , andrews @xcite showed that @xmath70 can be expressed in terms of modular forms and ramanujan s famous `` mock theta functions '' , which were only recently placed into the modern framework of real - analytic automorphic forms thanks to zwegers seminal ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "rhoades @xcite then proved the asymptotic series expansion for @xmath47 by using an extended version of the hardy - ramanujan circle method that the present authors originally developed for the asymptotic analysis of such non - modular functions in @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is a very challenging problem to determine the automorphic properties of a generic hypergeometric @xmath20-series .",
    "zagier s work on nahm s conjecture in @xcite provides a classification of modular hypergeometric @xmath20-series written in so - called `` eulerian '' form , and s. zwegers pointed out to us that this criterion shows that the shifted stack generating functions , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are not modular forms either .",
    "see section [ s : shifted : shifted ] for additional details .",
    "in contrast , the case of semi - strict stacks is more similar to some of the earlier rows , as @xmath73 can be expressed in terms of modular forms .",
    "we prove the final missing asymptotic formula using modular transformations and ingham s tauberian theorem .",
    "[ t : dm ] as @xmath59 , we have the asymptotic formula @xmath74    the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ s : partns ] we define the frobenius symbol of a partition , give a combinatorial bijection between partitions and receding stacks with summits , and finally prove theorem [ t : frob ] by relating frobenius symbols with no zeros to receding stacks . in section [ s : tauberian ]",
    "we recall ingham s tauberian theorem and then use it to prove theorem [ t : dm ] .",
    "we next address the case of shifted stacks , using the constant term method and saddle point method to prove theorem [ t : h ] in section [ s : shifted ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ s : summit ] by outlining the asymptotic analysis of stacks with summits and provide further discussion of stanley s and wright s works .",
    "the authors thank rob rhoades and sander zwegers for helpful comments regarding historical works relevant to shifted stacks .",
    "this section describes the combinatorial properties and asymptotic behavior of receding stacks , partitions , and frobenius symbols . in particular , we present a simple bijection between partitions and receding stacks with summits , and then describe the relationship between these stacks and frobenius symbols .",
    "indeed , our map essentially gives a `` conjugated '' version of the frobenius symbol ( in the sense that certain row and columns are interchanged ) , and it therefore comes as no surprise that our study also includes asymptotic results relevant to andrews study of frobenius symbols with no zeros in the top row from @xcite .      in @xcite , andrews defined a _",
    "frobenius symbol _ as two equal - length sequences of decreasing nonnegative integers , usually written in two rows as @xmath75 the _ size _ of such a symbol is defined to be the sum @xmath76 .",
    "the frobenius symbols of size @xmath0 are in bijective correspondence with the partitions of size @xmath0 .",
    "ferrer s diagram _ of a partition @xmath77 begins with a row of @xmath78 blocks , which is then followed below by ( left - justified ) rows of @xmath79 blocks .",
    "given such a diagram , the corresponding frobenius symbol is constructed by first setting @xmath80 to be the length of the main ( southeast ) diagnoal .",
    "the entry @xmath81 is then the length of the @xmath82th row that lies to the right of the diagonal , while @xmath83 is the length of the @xmath82th column that is below the diagonal .",
    "for example , the partition @xmath84 corresponds to the frobenius symbol @xmath85    [ r : frob0 ] it is straightforward to see that a frobenius symbol with a zero in the top row corresponds to a partition in which the @xmath80-th largest part is exactly @xmath80 for some @xmath86 .",
    "we now describe a bijection between partitions and receding stacks with summits that provides a combinatorial proof of the following result .",
    "see figure [ f : partitionbij ] for an example of the bijection .",
    "[ p : gs = p ] for all @xmath22 , the number of partitions of size @xmath0 is equal to the number of receding stacks with summits of size @xmath0 , so that @xmath87    this equality can also be read directly from the generating function , but the combinatorial arguments that follow provide a more refined understanding of the relationship between partitions and receding stacks with summits .    as in the construction of the frobenius symbol corresponding to a partition , we begin by considering separately the portion of the ferrer s diagram to the right and below the main diagonal .",
    "the summit @xmath7 of the receding stack is set to be the length of the main diagonal .",
    "the @xmath88 are determined by reading the portion of the diagram below the main diagonal as diagonal `` rows '' , beginning with the lower - left cell , which automatically gives @xmath89 .",
    "after reaching the summit @xmath7 along the main diagonal , the @xmath90 are then found by reading diagonal `` columns '' to the right of the main diagonal .",
    "proceeding along these columns , the lengths give the successive values of @xmath91 ending with the upper - right cell , which gives @xmath92 .",
    "it is routine to verify that the receding stack conditions , , , and are always satisfied .",
    "one needs only keep in mind that the cells in the ferrer s diagram of a partition are fully left- and top - justified .",
    "it is also clear that this map is a bijection , as the procedure is easily reversible , giving a well - defined inverse map from receding stacks with summits to partitions .      in this section",
    "we prove theorem [ t : frob ] .",
    "as first defined in the introductory section , @xmath93 denotes the number of frobenius symbols of size @xmath0 with no zeros in the top row , and @xmath65 enumerates the number of frobenius symbols of size @xmath0 that do contain a zero in the top row ( in particular , the final entry in the top row is the only one that can be zero ) .",
    "andrews showed in lemma 12 ( and the proof of theorem 4 ) of @xcite that the generating function for frobenius symbols without zeros in the top row is @xmath94 the simple identity @xmath95 can be rewritten as @xmath96 along with and , this implies that @xmath97 we therefore have @xmath98 for all @xmath22 . furthermore , comparing coefficients in , we also have @xmath99 as alluded to in table [ tab : stack ] , auluck proved an asymptotic formula for @xmath29 ; in particular , equation ( 15 ) of @xcite states that @xmath100 table [ tab : stack ] also contains hardy and ramanujan s famous asymptotic formula for the partition function , @xmath101 combined with , this completes the proof .",
    "the discussion at the end of section [ s : partns : frob ] and the proof of proposition [ p : gs = p ] also provide a combinatorial argument for the fact that @xmath98 .",
    "in particular , if the frobenius symbol of a partition has a zero in its top row , then the main diagonal of its ferrers diagram is longer than any diagonal to the right . using the bijection from proposition [ p : gs = p ] , the summit @xmath7 in the corresponding receding stack is therefore canonically larger than all of the @xmath26s .",
    "the partition in figure [ f : partitionbij ] is a relevant example , as the corresponding frobenius symbol in this case was @xmath102",
    "we begin this section by recalling a fundamental tool for analyzing the coefficients of combinatorial generating functions .",
    "we then apply it to the case of semi - strict stacks , proving theorem [ t : dm ] .",
    "we require the following tauberian theorem from @xcite , which allows us to describe the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of a power series using the analytic nature of the series itself .",
    "[ t : ingham ] let @xmath103 be a power series with weakly increasing nonnegative coefficients and radius of convergence equal to @xmath27 . if there are constants @xmath104 , @xmath105 such that @xmath106 as @xmath107 , then @xmath108 as @xmath109 .    in order to apply this theorem throughout the paper , we repeatedly use the following simple observation that guarantees increasing coefficients .    [ l : mono ] suppose that @xmath110 has non - negative coefficients @xmath111 then the series @xmath112 has monotonically increasing non - negative coefficients .",
    "lemma [ l : mono ] ( and therefore theorem [ t : ingham ] ) are easily adapted to any series @xmath113 whose coefficients are strictly positive after some fixed index @xmath114 .      in order to apply ingham s tauberian theorem to the case of semi - strict stacks",
    ", we must first understand the asymptotic behavior of the generating function @xmath73 ( cf . ) .",
    "this is best accomplished not with the expression in , but by rather using an alternative expression given by andrews in theorem 1 , equation ( 1.7 ) of @xcite ( see also ( 1.13 ) ) .",
    "he proved that @xmath115 which is a modular form , up to a rational expression in @xmath20 .",
    "if we let @xmath116 as in theorem [ t : ingham ] , then the modular inversion formula for dedekind s eta - function ( page 121 , proposition 14 of @xcite ) implies that as @xmath107 @xmath117    applying to , we find that @xmath118 as @xmath119 furthermore , lemma [ l : mono ] applied to ( or to the original generating function ) shows that the coefficients are monotonically increasing .",
    "theorem [ t : ingham ] now directly gives the theorem statement .",
    "in this section we use a variety of tools from complex analysis and number theory to prove theorem [ t : h ] . in particular , we begin with the constant term method , inserting an additional variable @xmath120 in order to identify as the constant term of the product of more recognizable number - theoretic functions .",
    "we then use cauchy s theorem to recover this coefficient as a contour integral ; the asymptotic behavior of the integral is obtained through the saddle point method .",
    "finally , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath38 is recovered from an application of ingham s tauberian theorem .",
    "the asymptotic analysis of shifted stacks with summits proceeds very similarly .",
    "it should be noted that this approach is a standard ( if not widely known ) technique for determining the asymptotic behavior of hypergeometric @xmath20-series written in eulerian form ( cf . proposition 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "this technique can also be applied in settings where there is not an eulerian @xmath20-series , such as the double summation studied in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the constant term method already appears in auluck s paper @xcite , where he used this approach to derive alternative expressions for each of the generating functions , , and .",
    "however , in his asymptotic analysis of shifted stacks , he then relied on somewhat oblique comparisons to the ( known ) asymptotic behavior of integer partitions ; the same is also true of wright s work in @xcite .",
    "our main contribution is that we immediately apply analytic approximation techniques ( such as modular transformations and the saddle point method ) after using the constant term method , rather than seeking to find exact expressions for generating functions .      in order to study",

    ", we find a similar asymptotic relationship between the coefficients , concluding that @xmath170    as described by watson in @xcite ( see equation ( c ) ) , ramanujan showed that @xmath171 where @xmath172 the famous rogers - ramanujan identities @xcite state that if @xmath173 or @xmath27 , then @xmath174 the right - side of is a modular function ( up to a rational power of @xmath20 ) , and as such its asymptotic expansion near @xmath175 is well - understood . under the assumption that @xmath176 has an asymptotic expansion of the same shape for both integral and non - integral @xmath140",
    ", ramanujan then recovered an expression equivalent to , although he did not offer any justification for this assumption .",
    "in this final section we briefly outline how stanley s and wright s work in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , together imply the asymptotic formula for stacks with summits from table [ tab : stack ] , namely that as @xmath177 @xmath178 specifically , stanley provided a formula for the generating function of stacks with summits , using an inclusion - exclusion argument to prove proposition 2.5.1 in @xcite , which gives that @xmath179 here we have adopted wright s notation for the `` false theta function '' ( see equation ( 1.4 ) in @xcite ) @xmath180 wright s own analysis of stacks in @xcite began with the closely related expression @xmath181 which had previously appeared as equation ( 20 ) of @xcite .",
    "wright s proof can then essentially be followed verbatim with @xmath182 replaced by @xmath183 , which leads to the asymptotic formula for stacks with summits .    although stanley and wright s arguments provide additional combinatorial and analytic information , we point out that also follows immediately from a specialization of heine s @xmath184 transformation ; in particular , set @xmath185 and @xmath186 in corollary 2.3 of @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile ( particularly for non - expert readers ) to further discuss why wright s proof can be modified in this manner .",
    "wright s general argument follows the philosophy of the circle method , where the coefficients of a generating series are recovered by applying cauchy s theorem , with the analysis further amplified by using asymptotic properties of the series near roots of unity . in the case of modular forms ( such as the partition function , up to a power of @xmath20 ) , hardy and ramanujan @xcite ( and later rademacher @xcite ) used cuspidal expansions in order to derive exact formulas for the coefficients .",
    "however , the presence of the non - modular @xmath182 in prevents a similarly powerful analysis for stacks .",
    "wright s modified approach instead has just one `` major arc '' , around the exponential singularity at the cusp @xmath187 , and is useful as it can be applied to any series that can be expressed as the product of a weakly holomorphic modular form with poles at the cusps and a series with a convergent asymptotic expansion ( e.g. , a meromorphic laurent series such as @xmath182 ) .",
    "in particular , the terms in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath9 can then be found from the asymptotic expansion of @xmath182 near @xmath175 , which is proven by euler - maclaurin summation in lemma 1 of @xcite .",
    "if @xmath116 and @xmath107 , then the first term of wright s expansion is stated as @xmath188 in other words , @xmath189 , so the asymptotic main terms for @xmath9 and @xmath12 are identical .",
    "alternatively , may also be proven by applying ingham s tauberian theorem , which may be viewed as an even more broadly applicable version of the circle method , with a correspondingly weaker conclusion that only provides the main asymptotic term . starting with and",
    ", one can use , theorem [ t : ingham ] and lemma [ l : mono ] from the present paper in order to conclude the claimed asymptotic formula for @xmath12 .",
