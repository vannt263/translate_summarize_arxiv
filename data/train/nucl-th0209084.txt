    "statistical fermi - pomeranchuk models have been used extensively to study particle yields and spectra since 1950 @xcite .",
    "this approach was developed as a qualitative description of the gross features of particle production .",
    "it was originally not meant to be theoretically an accurate picture , just a phase space estimate of what fermi called an upper limit on particle production in strong interaction processes .",
    "in fact , fermi defined the limitations of the statistical approach stating three conditions : 1 ) exclusion of particles such as photons which have weak coupling to the interacting system ; 2 ) absence of absolute chemical ( abundance ) equilibrium for many semi - weakly coupled particles ; 3 ) requirement of relative baryochemical equilibrium . at that time strangeness",
    "was not yet discovered , and today we can add 3b ) requirement of relative strangeness equilibrium .    in the ensuing decade , another important feature of the strong interactions was discovered : the existence of numerous hadronic resonances .",
    "this property of hadronic interactions poses a challenge for the statistical hadronization model as the yield of particles is sensitive to the unidentified high mass hadron resonance states .",
    "we will discuss how this influences the expected particle yields in section [ secmassspec ] .",
    "our objective is to establish the magnitude of systematic theoretical error we have to expect given incomplete knowledge of the hadronic mass spectrum .",
    "a tacit assumption in our approach is that hadron - hadron interaction is well described by the formation of resonant states , and the remaining residual forces are negligible in comparison to the available energy content per particle .",
    "understanding the hadro - chemistry , _",
    "i.e. , _ of the composition of particles produced , can finger - print the phase of matter which has undergone statistical hadronization .",
    "therefore , we will describe how chemical parameters , the chemical potentials @xmath0 and the phase space occupancy parameters @xmath1 , allow to regulate the particle number .",
    "we show how the chemical non - equilibrium is characterized in section [ nonchem ] .",
    "we then demonstrate , in section [ analysis ] , that the _ nearly complete particle production results _ force upon us the study of chemical non - equilibrium .",
    "we demonstrate in particular that a precise description of all rhic results obtained at @xmath2gev ( rhic-130 ) is possible within the scheme we propose .",
    "fermi s statistical model provided the intellectual environment for the theoretical understanding of the exponentially growing hadronic mass spectrum within the statistical bootstrap model invented by rolf hagedorn @xcite .",
    "hagedorn recognized early on that the large number of different hadronic states , and the increase in their number with their mass , has great practical implications for the behavior of matter at high temperature , and can lead to the formation of a new phase of matter .    within fermi s statistical model the number of heavy hadron resonances produced is exponentially suppressed with the ratio of the mass of the particle considered to the temperature present . in spite of this , if the number of different resonances per unit of mass , the mass spectrum @xmath3 , increases exponentially , @xmath4 there still would be a critical temperature of hadronic matter , corresponding to the ( inverse ) slope @xmath5 of the exponential mass spectrum : @xmath6 hagedorn called this the boiling of hadronic matter @xcite . hot hadronic matter behaved at this point in the same way as in high temperature 1st order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "there is strong empirical evidence that the experimental mass spectrum grows exponentially at least in the interval of interest to the study of particle production @xcite .",
    "smoothed mass spectrum based on 4627 states known in 1996 is shown as a short dashed line in figure [ specm ] , while the 1411 states of 1966 , used by hagedorn @xcite , are depicted by long dashed line in figure [ specm ] .",
    "the solid line is a fit to the experimental mass spectrum eq.([rhom ] ) with the assumed value @xmath7 which yields @xmath8 mev .    proposing that the solid line describes reasonably the mass spectrum , we see that a significant number of resonances remains to be identified for @xmath9 gev ( note the logarithmic scale in the figure [ specm ] ) .",
    "when a study of particle yields is made , a significant systematic uncertainty derived from the lack of knowledge of hadronic mass spectrum can arise , in particular so for models finding relatively high statistical hadronization temperatures . at a hadronization temperature of @xmath10 mev",
    ", a study of the properties of the particle yields suggests that only about 5% of pions are ` missing ' .",
    "however , at @xmath11 mev @xcite , this increases to 35% , and the high value of temperature considered poses a practical challenge , since the statistical bootstrap model and the lattice - qcd results for 2 + 1 flavors @xcite are converging to a critical temperature at @xmath12mev .    one way to assess the magnitude of the systematic error is to compare the properties of the hadron gas using the mass spectrum of the type given in eq.([rhom ] ) with that studied using the currently known experimental mass spectrum . for a range of values @xmath13 ( most divergent curve in left frame in figure [ pointgas ] ) and",
    "@xmath14 , the energy density @xmath15 ( solid lines ) and pressure @xmath16 ( dashed lines ) , both scaled with @xmath17 , are compared to the values obtained summing all known hadronic states ( thin line in figure [ pointgas ] ) .",
    "the differences as expected are dramatic at high temperature , near to the boiling point of hadronic matter .",
    "it turns out that the problem is reduced considering the hadron proper volume @xcite . reconsidering the energy density assuming a proper energy density of hadrons",
    "as derived from the bag constant @xmath18=@xmath19 , we find that the expected excess counting the energy density degrees of freedom remains at the level of 10% as is seen in right frame in figure [ pointgas ] .",
    "while this allows to apply statistical hadronization method in study of particle abundance ratios , the influence of quantitatively uncertain finite size correction is very large , implying in particular in the pion yield a considerable systematic theoretical error .",
    "in general the fugacity @xmath20 of each individual particle will comprise the two chemical factors associated with the two different chemical equilibria .",
    "for example , let us look at the nucleon , and the antinucleon fugacity and chemical potentials : @xmath21 there is an obvious difference between the two chemical factors in eq.([upsilonn ] ) : the number of nucleon - antinucleon pairs is associated with the value of @xmath22 but not with@xmath23 .",
    "this can be seen looking at the first law of thermodynamics , in this context written as : @xmath24 to obtain the second form , we have employed eq.([sigman ] ) .",
    "we see that @xmath23 is the energy required to change the baryon number , @xmath25 by one unit , while the number of nucleon - antinucleon pairs , @xmath26 is related to @xmath22 . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the last term vanishes , at this point small fluctuation in number of nucleon pairs does not influence the energy of the system , we have reached the absolute baryochemical equilibrium .",
    "it is convenient to follow the quark flavor even in the study of hadron yields , since this allows to keep the same notation across the phase boundary of quark matter and hadronic gas matter .",
    "we use : @xmath28 when the light flavors @xmath29 remain indistinguishable we introduce @xmath30 .    the relationship of baryochemical potential @xmath23 and of strangeness chemical @xmath31 to quark chemical potential is : @xmath32 these relations arise considering that three quarks make a baryon , and remembering that strange quarks carry _ negative _ strangeness and one third of baryon number .    when using of fugacities which follow the valance quarks , @xmath33 , hadronic particle yields can be easily checked , and thus errors and omissions in a rather complex and large particle ` zoo ' minimized .",
    "consider , as an example , the ratio @xmath34 .",
    "given the quark content and ignoring ( at rhic very small ) isospin asymmetry , we find : @xmath35 since all @xmath36 resonances which contribute to this ratio are symmetric for particles and antiparticles , and possible weak interaction feed from @xmath37 , and respectively @xmath38 , are small , these expressions are actually nearly exact .",
    "thus we have inverted the relation and expressed @xmath31 in terms of @xmath23 and the cascade ratio .",
    "this allows the reader to check for correctness results presented elsewhere .",
    "results shown in @xcite appear inconsistent by 50% while those in @xcite are numerically consistent .",
    "the important lesson to be drawn from eq.([xirat ] ) is that when we compare in a ratio particle with antiparticle we ` see ' the chemical potentials . as we shall see below and use in section [ analysis ] , the chemical non - equilibrium parameters are probed with _",
    "products _ of yields of particles and antiparticles .",
    "near to chemical equilibrium , we use three non - equilibrium parameters , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 or equivalently just two parameters introducing , @xmath41 . in",
    "quark matter , these coefficients express the approach to the expected chemical equilibrium yield by the quark abundances . in a coalescence hadronization process",
    ", gluons fragment into quark pairs and the net yields of quarks and antiquarks of all flavors is redistributed among all individual hadrons .",
    "hence even if there were no change of the quark pair number in hadronization , the values of @xmath42 in hadron gas and quark matter must differ .",
    "moreover , the phase spaces have different size , and it is impossible in the rapidly evolving fireballs to reequilibrate several quark flavors .",
    "thus , we have to distinguish : @xmath43    the lesson is that in an analysis of experimental data , we explore the properties and parameters of the hadron gas phase ( hg ) .",
    "while these may be smooth across hadronization for the chemical potentials @xmath0 , we expect the phase space occupancy parameters @xmath1 to be quite different in the confined and deconfined phase .",
    "we obtain the fugacities of all hadrons in terms of six parameters , which implicitly carry the upper index ` hg ' .",
    "it is best to see how this works looking at typical examples : + a ) baryons : protons @xmath44 , antiprotons @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc : @xmath48 b ) mesons : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , etc : @xmath53 note that in the products of particle @xmath54 and antiparticle @xmath55 fugacity the chemical potentials @xmath0 always cancel @xmath56 .    in the statistical hadronization approach",
    ", we have the same value of @xmath57 for all hadrons with the same valance quark content .",
    "for example @xmath58 .",
    "thus , we assume tacitly that the relative population of heavier resonances is in chemical equilibrium with the lighter states .",
    "this means that statistical hadronization resolves the valance quark and antiquark distribution and does not allow for the possibility that heavier resonances may simply not be populated .",
    "this method , thus , is most suitable for a hadronizing quark matter fireball , and may miss important features of a hadron fireball which never entered the deconfined phase .",
    "the physical properties of the gas of hadrons with @xmath59 have certain highly desirable properties .",
    "consider the properties of the pion gas as function of @xmath60 , and in particular the entropy ( b for bosons and f for fermions ) : @xmath61\\,,\\qquad   f_\\pi=\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{q}^{-2}e^{e_\\pi\\over t}-1}\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath62 .",
    "we see , in figure [ piongas ] , that the entropy density is rising rapidly and it nearly doubles with @xmath60 increasing from the equilibrium value @xmath63 toward condensation point @xmath64 .",
    "this high entropy content of the oversaturated pion gas allows the sudden hadronization of qgp without reheating or inflation ( volume expansion ) .",
    "a striking feature of the experimental data analysis which allows for @xmath60 is the maximization of entropy density in pion gas , _",
    "i.e. , _ natural tendency toward the value @xmath64 .",
    "there are in our approach at most 6 chemical parameters , and hadronization temperature . especially at rhic , we need not distinguish the light flavors @xmath29 and thus the number of statistical parameters is reduced by two .",
    "a further reduction is arrived at when we demand that strangeness balances anti - strangeness locally , and finally the requirement that when entropy rich quark - gluon plasma hadronizes , the yields of hadrons are maximizing the entropy content of hadrons , yields @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we are in fact needing just two chemical parameters which are usually @xmath30 and @xmath39 . both at sps @xcite and at rhic @xcite , there is good evidence for a single freeze - out to apply , in consistency with the sudden hadronization hypothesis . in other words ,",
    "one single temperature allows to understand both yields and spectra of hadrons .",
    "the computation of the particle yields is much simpler than for sps . for central rapidity ,",
    "we have , at rhic-130 , approximate longitudinal scaling .",
    "thus , we can act as if a series of fireballs at all rapidities was present .",
    "then , we simply evaluate the full phase - space yields in order to obtain particle ratios .",
    "we do not include in our analysis trivial results such as @xmath65 .",
    "we also do not fit the results for @xmath66 and @xmath67 since the reconstructed yields depend on the degree of rescattering of resonance decay products .",
    "we first convince ourselves that the introduction of chemical non equilibrium in the study of hadron abundances is necessary  even though one could argue that if it is not needed , the data fit will converge to chemical equilibrium condition . therefore before we present an overall fit of many particle yields , we present a short but persuasive argument .",
    "as noted , when we evaluate the product of particle and antiparticle yields , the chemical potentials @xmath0 cancel .",
    "studying such products allows to focus only on @xmath68 .",
    "we next identify three ratios involving products of particles and antiparticles : @xmath69 by comparing mesons with mesons , and baryons with baryons we reduce uncertainties about excluded volume .",
    "the ratios considered in eq.([multiratio ] ) have only two parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "thus , it is possible to present , in a two dimensional figure , how these three ratios behave , as is seen in figure [ ggt ] for the experimental data obtained at rhic-130 ( see table [ rhichad ] below ) . dashed area shows the allowed parameter domain .",
    "the cross in the figure is the result of global data analysis discusses below where the ratio of baryons to mesons , not used here , fixes the temperature .",
    "while the kaon to pion ratio would tolerate within one standard deviation the chemical equilibrium , the baryon double ratios , and in particular the more strange cascades , are clearly demanding a value of @xmath72 .",
    "we use the latest experimental results for the ratio of hyperons to nucleons ( yields of @xmath73 are weak decay feed corrected , @xmath74 are uncorrected ) @xcite .",
    "this result is nearly by a factor _ two _ different from the experimental data stated in @xcite , and this reference also does not consider @xmath75 results other than their ratio , and is therefore consistent with the chemical equilibrium in the result of its analysis .",
