    "an approximate census of massive galaxies at redshift @xmath1 provides a morphological classification into 40% disks , 15% extended spheroids , 25% compact spheroids and 20% peculiar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more than 9 gyrs later , in the present - day universe , a similar census of massive galaxies gives 30% disks , 65% extended spheroids and 5% peculiar morphologies .",
    "strikingly , compact spheroids are virtually absent in the present - day universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath1 , the majority ( @xmath280 % ) of massive compact spheroids",
    "were already quiescent , while the rest were actively forming stars .",
    "the massive high - redshift quiescent compact galaxies have been termed _",
    "red nuggets _",
    "recent studies on the number density evolution of red nuggets point to the star forming compact massive galaxies ( scmg ) as their probable progenitors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at redshift @xmath3 ,",
    "the number density of scmgs matched that of red nuggets .",
    "by @xmath1 , 1.5 gyr later , the number density of red nuggets has increased by an order of magnitude while that of scmgs has decreased by a factor of two .",
    "the straightforward interpretation is that the red nuggets are the descendants of rapidly quenched scmgs .",
    "but unlike this relative consensus on the origin of red nuggets , there is not the same agreement regarding their fate after @xmath1 .",
    "red nuggets were discovered almost a decade ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more than a hundred studies have been carried out on their evolution . since their discovery , red nuggets have been linked to present - day elliptical galaxies ; the two classes share a similar spheroidal morphology , and the fraction of elliptical galaxies ( extended spheroids ) has increased by a factor of four in the last 9 gyrs @xcite .",
    "but for the former population to have evolved into the latter , there must be a mechanism by which an ultra - compact spheroid with half - light radius of @xmath21 kpc can become a fully - fledged elliptical , three to six times larger .",
    "several physical processes , including major and minor mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and puffing - up by agn activity @xcite , have been proposed to explain the considerable growth in size .",
    "the prevailing paradigm , put forward by @xcite and @xcite , postulates an appealing scenario in which red nuggets ended up in the centres of present - day giant ellipticals .",
    "this proposal is consistent with the inside - out growth scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which compact cores are formed at high redshift ( @xmath4 ) through highly dissipative processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and then grow an extended stellar halo through dissipation - less minor mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to this traditional evolutionary scenario , there is another potentially important channel leading from red nuggets to disk galaxy bulges .",
    "the main observational evidences for this scenario have been provided by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite sample includes the set of 19 red nuggets observed by @xcite and a catalogue of few hundred bulges compiled by @xcite . in two subsequent studies , @xcite and @xcite carried out detailed bulge+disk ( b+d ) decompositions , but only for a small sample of present - day s0 galaxies , finding that s0 bulges are structurally similar to red nuggets .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite presents an instructive sketch of mass - size and mass - density diagrams for all the spheroidal families , from giant elliptical galaxies to globular clusters . in the accompanying text",
    ", the author emphasises the considerable overlap of the structural properties of red nuggets with those of present - day bulges .",
    "based on cosmological simulations , @xcite and @xcite show that extended star - forming discs develop around red nuggets after compaction .    the aim of the present study is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the connection between red nuggets and present - day compact cores without any restriction on the morphology of the host galaxies .",
    "specifically , the hypothesis we want to test is that a significant fraction of red nuggets have _ survived _ , masked inside spheroidal or disc galaxies in the present - day universe .    to support this hypothesis",
    ", we would need to find a sufficient population of compact cores embedded inside present - day galaxies , where :    * _ core _ is a generalization of the bulge component in b+d decomposition of galaxies with all morphologies . * _ compact core _ is a core that fulfills the same compactness criterion used for red nuggets .",
    "we test the robustness of our results using three different definition of compactness , from the literature . *",
    "_ sufficient _ means that the abundance of present - day red nugget - like cores should be approaching 20 % of the red nuggets to have been consumed or destroyed in merger events , so the abundances should not necessarily match exactly . ] that of the red nuggets at @xmath1 .",
    "the present study takes advantage of sdss - based catalogues containing b+d decomposition of hundreds of thousands of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , we have used the @xcite catalogue , itself a derivation of @xcite , which provides stellar masses for the b and d structural components .",
    "we impose the b+d decomposition on the entire present - day galaxy sample , regardless of their morphology , designating as _ cores _ both the central components of ellipticals and the bulges of disc galaxies .",
    "after b+d decomposition , cores are treated as independent structures and evaluated for their compactness , according to standard criteria ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following : section 2 is devoted to the data description , including the selection of the z@xmath20 compact core sample , reference elliptical galaxies and the compilation of red nuggets from the literature .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the results of the present study , in particular the check of the working hypothesis , i.e. that red nuggets have survived as the compact cores of present - day galaxies .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "decimal logarithms are used along the study . to keep consistency with other studies",
    ", we assume a @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath6 = 0.7 , @xmath7 = 0.3 and @xmath8 = 70 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 .",
    "several samples are extracted from the parent catalogue @xcite .",
    "first we introduce the compactness criteria , which allow the selection of structurally similar cores and red nuggets .",
    "second , low - redshift samples , namely the compact cores and reference ellipticals , are introduced and third , the high - redshift red nugget sample is presented .      our goal is to measure the abundance of z@xmath20.1 galaxy cores structurally similar to red nuggets , and compare it to that of red nuggets at z@xmath21.5 .",
    "therefore , information on the red nugget number density as a function of redshift becomes crucial for our work .",
    "three different studies have addressed this issue in the literature , based on different criteria to define the red nuggets .",
    "as emphasised by @xcite , the galaxy number densities and the structural parameters are rather sensitive to the choice of the compactness criterion , as well as to the stellar mass range probed .",
    "consequently , we have to assure that each comparison is carried out under the same selection criteria .    in the present study ,",
    "circularised half - light radii @xmath10 have been used , with @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the half - light radius along the major - axis and ( b / a ) is the axis ratio of the galaxy .    in order to test the robustness of our results ,",
    "we compute the number density of red nuggets using three alternative definitions of compactness :    @xmath13 the criterion proposed by @xcite ( hereinafter barro13 ) , used by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath14 this is generally associated with a mass limit @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath13 a more restrictive compactness criterion , proposed by @xcite ( hereinafter vdokkum15 ) , @xmath16 with a @xmath17 limit .",
    "@xmath13 finally , the criterion proposed by @xcite ( hereinafter vdwel14 ) @xmath18 with a @xmath19 limit .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this criterion uses @xmath12 , the half - light radius measured along the galaxy major axis , instead of the more common circularized radius , @xmath10 .",
    "while we test our results on the abundances of red nuggets and compact cores using all three different sets of selection criteria (  [ sec : numberdens ] ) , for the first part of this paper (   [ sec : photo ] - [ sec : dyn ] ) we adopt the vdokkum15 definition .",
    "in fact , the definition of vdwel14 would not allow us to perform a direct comparison to other spheroidal systems (  [ sec : photo ] ) as it is based on major - axis effective radii .",
    "on the other hand , the lower mass cutoff of barro13 would imply a significantly higher contamination from star - forming galaxies in our sample of red nuggets , with respect to the vdokkum15 higher mass cutoff ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the parent sample used in our study is the @xcite catalogue ( hereafter mendel14 ) , an upgraded section of the @xcite catalogue ( simard11 ) , which contains the b+d decomposition of more than one million sdss - dr7 galaxies .",
    "the main improvement to the original catalogue is the stellar mass calculation of the bulge and disk components .",
    "stellar masses are computed through spectral energy distribution ( sed)-fitting to the five sdss-@xmath20 bands , using dusty synthetic templates from @xcite with a @xcite stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the mendel14 catalogue includes 657,996 galaxies from the sdss - dr7 @xcite with spectroscopic redshifts and successful @xmath20 b+d decomposition available .",
    "the original 2d decomposition in simard11 used three alternative galaxy fitting models :    1 .",
    "de vaucouleurs bulge ( fixed sersic index @xmath21 = 4 ) + exponential disk ( sersic index @xmath22 = 1 ) , 2 .",
    "exponential disk + free-@xmath23 , with @xmath23 allowed to vary from 0.5 to 8 and 3 .",
    "a single component free @xmath24-sersic model to fit the whole galaxy ( @xmath24-sersic ) .",
    "it is important to notice that mendel14 stellar masses were computed using only two of those fitting models : ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the bias introduced by the use of ( i ) instead of ( ii ) is discussed in appendix  [ app : bias ] .",
    "two low - redshift subsamples are extracted from the mendel14 catalogue .",
    "the main one is the _ compact core _",
    "subsample (  [ sec : compl ] ) , including galaxy cores that fulfill the vdokkum15 compactness criterion .",
    "the second subsample consists of bona - fide ellipticals (  [ sec : ellipt ] ) , and serves as a reference point for the study of galaxy structural properties (  [ sec : photo ] ) .",
    "bulge - disk decomposition is a delicate procedure demanding extra care to guarantee reliable outcomes .",
    "we have applied a rigorous screening , with eight steps , generally following the recommendations of the catalogue authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we select compact cores from the mendel14 catalogue based on different criteria .",
    "this is summarized in table  [ tab : subs ] , where we also report the number of objects surviving each selection step .",
    "first , we adopt a surface brightness limit of @xmath25 mag arcsec@xmath26 to assure a complete sample . although the formal surface brightness limit of the sdss spectroscopic sample is @xmath27 mag arcsec@xmath26 @xcite , the sample in the range @xmath28 23.0 - 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath26 is not complete because galaxies were targeted only under some particular local sky conditions .",
    "second , we exclude objects with uncertain decomposition , using the parameter _ dbd _ , which is the offset between two alternative galaxy mass calculations , @xmath29 + @xmath30 ( sum of independently derived bulge and disk masses ) and @xmath31 ( mass derived from the total bulge+disk photometry ) in units of the standard error .",
    "significant inequality between these two masses is an indication of inconsistent decomposition , so systems with the cutoff @xmath32 , proposed by mendel14 , are excluded .",
    "these two cuts removed 9.5 % of the objects , as seen in table  [ tab : subs ]    ) .",
    "three compactness criteria , barro13 , vdokkum15 and vdwel14 ( described in the text ) , are overplotted and compact cores are located below the dashed lines , rendering 65,637 systems under the barro13 criterion .",
    "the more restrictive vdokkum15 and vdwel14 criteria render 10,566 and 12,721 respectively .",
    "note that the vdwel14 line is only approximate , because the criterion requires major - axis sizes instead of the circularized radii used in the plot .",
    "the isolated white dot marks the approximate location of the milky way s bulge ( e.g. di matteo et al . 2015 ; licquia & newman , 2015 ) . ]    the third cutoff , limiting the redshift range , is set to achieve a significant sample completeness in terms of the core stellar mass , @xmath33 , the main reference parameter of this study .",
    "the choice of redshift range , @xmath34 , yields a significant completeness in our target mass range , @xmath35 , as discussed in appendix  [ app : compl ] .",
    "notice that in the number density estimations (  [ sec : numberdens ] ) , the v / vmax statistic is also used to correct for any residual incompleteness .    in the fourth step ,",
    "we exclude galaxies reported to show anomalous b+d decomposition , tagged ` type-4 ' in the mendel14 classification .",
    "they comprise galaxy / star superposition and inverted b+d profiles , in which a disk dominates at the center and a bulge at the external parts .",
    "following @xcite , fifth and sixth cutoffs were applied to promote face - on inclinations and to avoid strong bars .",
    "face - on galaxies ( disk inclination @xmath36 60 degrees ) are favoured in order to minimize internal disk extinction on the bulge light , while high bulge ellipticities are avoided to prevent strong bars being mistaken for bulges ( e@xmath37 0.6 ) .    finally , the potential impact of poorly resolved galaxy images on the b+d decomposition is considered .",
    "we follow the study by @xcite , which showed that the structural properties of cores can be reliably retrieved provided that their effective radii are larger than @xmath2 80 per cent of the psf half - width - at - half - maximum ( hwhm ) , i.e. ( @xmath38/psf ) @xmath39 0.8 . so far , by imposing these seven selection criteria , the parent sample has been reduced to 203,369 objects ( 31% of the original sample ; see tab .  [",
    "tab : subs ] ) .",
    "the last selection is on the cores that fulfill the vdokkum15 compactness criterion ( equation [ eq : vd15 ] ) .",
    "additionally , table [ tab : subs ] shows the corresponding results for the other criteria ( equations [ eq : barro13 ] and [ eq : vdw14 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : compactness ] provides a visual display of the compact core selection criteria for both barro13 and vdokkum15 on top of a 2d histogram including the 203,369 objects , which got through the first seven screening steps .",
    "the _ compact core _ definition is essential to the present study and deserves further clarification .",
    "the b+d decomposition is straightforward for disk galaxies , where a compact core is simply a bulge that has satisfied the compactness criterion . a decomposed elliptical galaxy",
    "should not be interpreted literally as having physically meaningful bulge and a disk .",
    "in addition to the central _ core _ , the external component can be a disk , a halo or any significant departure from a single fit .",
    "distinct inner components have been extensively observed in ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that more than 75 % of their sample of 94 nearby elliptical galaxies were better described when additional subcomponents were added to the conventional single sersic function .",
    ".subsample selection , listing the steps leading from the parent sample ( mendel14 ) to our _ compact core _",
    "steps are described in the main text . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "our goal here is to assess the morphological variety of the fully - fledged galaxies that host compact cores ( rather than analyzing the compact core structure itself as in ",
    "[ sec : photo ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : morphology ] and table  [ tab : morphotype ] show these results , with mass estimates , @xmath40 , also being for the the total host galaxy ( not the core mass ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : morphology ] shows the variation along @xmath40 of the four morphology class fractions . aside from the scd class , which contributes a negligible amount ,",
    "the other classes are identified by coloured bands . inside each colour band ,",
    "lines and symbols identify the results of each compactness criterion .",
    "only the barro13 results span the mass range down to the @xmath41 level .",
    "the histograms , in the lower part , show the mass range covered by each compactness criterion .",
    "note that very few galaxies , hosting compact cores , populate the @xmath42 bin ( 19 galaxies for vdokkum15 and 40 for vdwel14 ) and their presence is imperceptible in the histogram .",
    "nevertheless , the morphology fraction is calculated for those galaxies .",
    "table  [ tab : morphotype ] gives for morphology fractions integrated across all masses ( hence less detailed than the mass - dependant results shown in figure  [ fig : morphology ] ) .",
    "using the vdokkum15 sample in table  [ tab : subs ] , all host galaxies with compact cores of log(m@xmath4310.6 ( 10,566 ) are integrated into four morphology fraction values .",
    "host galaxy morphology essentially divides into a 50:50 mixture of elliptical and disk morphology ( note that the majority of the sample is in early - type systems : e + s0 ) .",
    "an alternative option to figure  [ fig : morphology ] , using m@xmath44 masses is considered in appendix  [ app : morpho ] .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : morphology ] , s0 and sab classes dominate the morphologies of galaxies hosting compact cores , for log(m@xmath4511.0 . at the high - mass end ,",
    "elliptical galaxies predominate over their disk counterparts .",
    "integrated values in table  [ tab : morphotype ] give more balanced results with comparable fractions of elliptical and s0 classes and minor contributions from later - type disk classes .",
    "a further simple computation can provide an estimation of the average extra stellar mass incorporated on top of the naked red nuggets to become fully - fledged present - day galaxies .",
    "assuming that the red nuggets survive intact since redshift @xmath46 , the extra mass acquired during the last @xmath2 9.2 gyr equates to the difference between the total and the core masses , roughly equal to the b+d decomposed disk - mass ( md ) in mendel14 .",
    "the average extra mass for the vdokkum15 selected sample is @xmath47 = 10.53 , which means that an average 25.3@xmath4813.5 % of the total galaxy mass at z@xmath20.1 has been accreted since z@xmath21.5 at a growth rate @xmath49 .",
    "these results are consistent with those of @xcite , who estimate that @xmath50 of the total stellar mass at @xmath51 would have been added through mergers since @xmath52 under this hypothesis .",
    "there is even better agreement with @xcite , who report a 33 % mass increase from z@xmath21.5 to z@xmath20.1 .",
    "a few recent studies have offered interesting explanations for the early red nugget density evolution at redshifts larger than @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite offer a convincing explanation for the number density increase of red nuggets earlier than @xmath52 , built on the simultaneous decline of the number density of star forming compact massive galaxies ( scmg ) .",
    "their result has been corroborated by @xcite .",
    "this interpretation suggests that the scmg are being continuously converted into red nuggets by processes quenching their star formation , while new scmgs are replenished by cold flows , until that process becomes inefficient by @xmath53 .",
    "oddly , red nugget evolution below @xmath1 is characterised by observational disagreement and the lack of unanimous interpretation .",
    "for instance , our relatively high number density of @xmath0 compact cores , @xmath54 , ( see table  [ tab : numberdens ] and figure  [ fig : numberdensity ] ) come into apparent conflict with the majority of the results from the literature , which range from lower ( @xmath55 mpc@xmath56 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) to higher number densities ( @xmath57 mpc@xmath56 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this conflict is only _ apparent _ because the discrepancy results from the adoption of different search strategies , looking for either compact full galaxies ( literature ) or compact cores ( this study ) .",
    "contrary to compact cores , which are relatively abundant , very few full galaxies satisfy the demanding compactness criteria in their own right . in order to check this statement",
    "we have used our own data to calculate the number density of full galaxies satisfying the vdokkum15 compactness criterion . by using the single - sersic fit version of the mass - size parameters from the mendel14 catalogue , we obtain a number density of @xmath58 , an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding compact core number density ( as shown in figure  [ fig : numberdensity ] ) .    according to the hypothesis we are testing here , red nuggets - once formed - do not significantly change their internal structure or composition , but simply aggregate 2d or 3d envelopes to become the compact massive cores of present - day galaxies . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the number density of @xmath0 compact cores should approximately match , or be slightly less than , the maximum value attained by the red nuggets .",
    "we have now shown that this is the case ( see figure  [ fig : numberdensity ] and table  [ tab : numberdens ] ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with a recent study by @xcite , their sample of 21 structurally decomposed lenticular galaxies also having a relatively high number density , comparable to our own lower - limits .",
    "comparison with full galaxies at @xmath0 , rather than with compact cores , leads to a discrepancy , as shown here and in the literature .",
    "this is in no conflict with the above hypothesis which asserts only that the cores are sufficient  not necessary  building blocks for @xmath59 galaxies .",
    "in this study , we have tested the hypothesis that high - redshift compact , quiescent and massive galaxies , nicknamed _",
    "red nuggets _ , have survived as the compact cores of massive present - day elliptical or disk galaxies .",
    "two main questions are posed to test this hypothesis :    1 .",
    "do compact cores , structurally similar to red nuggets , exist at @xmath0 ?",
    "2 .   if so , is their abundance comparable to that of red nuggets at @xmath1 ?",
    "we carry out this test using the recently published sdss - based large catalogues of bulge+disk ( b+d ) galaxy decompositions , in particular from @xcite , which includes stellar masses of the b and d structural components .",
    "we approach the test from a comprehensive perspective , imposing the b+d decomposition to the whole present - day galaxy sample , regardless of their morphology types .",
    "we adopt the generic name _ core _ to include the central component of ellipticals and bulge of disks , and study these as if they were independent structures , defined based on their compactness , according to same criteria adopted in the literature to identify the red nuggets themselves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth mentioning that our results depend heavily on the reliability of the photometric bulge+disk decomposition of sdss galaxy data .",
    "nevertheless , the huge size of the parent catalogue has allowed us to carry out a very strict quality screening , only passed by @xmath60 % of the objects .    in summary",
    ", the study concludes that the answer to both these questions above is _",
    "yes_. the details of this conclusion and other key results are as follows :    @xmath13 we confirm that a small but significant fraction ( @xmath615% ) of cores in present - day galaxies ( regardless of morphology ) is structurally similar to z@xmath21.5 red nuggets . in the mass - size and mass - density relations ,",
    "the red nuggets and compact cores are significantly segregated from the normal elliptical galaxies , with average sizes @xmath24 times smaller and densities @xmath220 times larger than normal ellipticals at a given mass ( e.g. @xmath62 ) ( figure  [ fig : spheroids ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 not only do such compact cores exist , but their abundance matches approximately that of the red nuggets at @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this result is quite consistent with previous findings on the present - day abundance of compact galaxies , as we use of b+d decomposed cores ( rather than to full galaxies ) .",
    "@xmath13 that these number densities are , if anything , slightly lower than the highest values for red nuggets , further agrees with the hypothesis , leaving room for the some @xmath220% of red nuggets to have been destroyed in major merger events ( as found in some cosmological simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath13 dynamical measurements of the samples of red nuggets , compact core and ellipticals corroborates the photometric analysis .",
    "velocity dispersion , @xmath63 , and dynamical mass density in red nuggets and compact cores are systematically larger than in normal ellipticals .",
    "for instance at a given @xmath64 , @xmath63 is 1.5 - 1.7 times larger and dynamical - mass density 11 - 35 times higher than in the normal ellipticals ( figures  [ fig : veldisp ] and [ fig : mdyn ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 a simple calculation allows us to estimate the extra mass accreted by the red nuggets to become fully - fledged galaxies , under this hypothesis . assuming that red nuggets start ` naked ' or with only rudimentary disks at @xmath1 , the extra stellar mass acquired over the last @xmath65gyr is the difference between the mass of the galaxy and that of the compact core .",
    "we find that galaxies hosting a compact core would typically have accreted one quarter of their mass over the last @xmath65gyr , at a growth rate of @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath13 galaxies hosting compact cores ( according to the vdokkum15 criterion ) show varied morphological classes extending from ellipticals to spirals ( scd ) .",
    "the integrated fractions of morphology classes with @xmath6710.5 are : 50.9% ( e ) , 43.4% ( s0 ) , 5.4% ( sab ) and 0.3% ( scd ) .",
    "results for alternative mass ranges and compactness criteria are given in figure  [ fig : morphology ] and appendix  [ app : morpho ] .",

    "although we use the v / vmax statistics to correct for residual incompleteness in number density estimations (  [ sec : numberdens ] ) , it is advisable to rely on a sample with the highest possible degree of completeness throughout our target mass range , @xmath70 .    to assess the sample completeness ,",

    "our strategy to obtain a nearly complete sample for @xmath77 is based on avoiding redshift ranges which are poorly populated due to incompleteness .",

    "following @xcite , we have extracted emission line fluxes to construct the bpt diagram @xcite .",
    "we designate an object as _ emission _ when the four diagnostic lines have been detected with signal - to - noise ratio above 2 .",
    "the agn identification in the bpt diagram follows the empirical separation from @xcite and includes both the seyfert and liner classes .",
    "galaxies designated as _ emission _ ( agn ) make the 14 ( 5)% of the compact core subsample , while corresponding figures for the non - core elliptical subsample are 10(4)% .",
    "the mass - size and mass - density relations ( figure  [ fig : spheroids ] ) , represented by the median values in mass bins , are unaffected by the exclusion of agns or even the exclusion of _ emission _ objects , proving that agn contamination is not an issue for our results .        concerning the choice of the bulge sersic index , mendel14 catalogue uses a fixed de vaucouleurs bulge fit ( @xmath23=4 ) , instead of a free-@xmath23 fit .",
    "according to the authors , the vast majority of sdss images have insufficient spatial resolution and/or signal - to - noise ratio to provide an adequate n - bulge determination and there is no significant advantage on using free - n@xmath82 over fixed n@xmath82=4 fits .",
    "as explained by @xcite , at the sdss resolution , the bulges have their profile tail subsumed in the disk , while the central peak is washed out by the psf , making a bulge with say @xmath23=4 indistinguishable from one with 3@xmath83 .    while mendel14 only derive masses for the @xmath84 b+d",
    "fits , simard11 provide photometric parameters for both free - n and fixed n=4 fits .",
    "we have used our compact core sample ( 10,566 objects ) to assess the potential bias introduced by the sersic index choice on the structural parameters .",
    "alternative galaxy / core size calculations are compared in figure [ fig : appb_1 ] . as a common base",

    "free - n cores are , on average , @xmath87  dex larger than n=4 cores of similar mass .",
    "the use of free - n would decrease the reported separation of @xmath88  dex between the reference ellipticals and compact cores ( see section [ fig : spheroids ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , we avoided the use of free - n cores in the present study , due to the lack of @xmath33 information in the catalogues . in conclusion , the choice of sersic index does not drastically affect our results .",
    "the moderate sensitivity to the sersic index choice is an expected outcome of the distribution of the sersic indexes in the free - n fits , which has 78 % of the values in the interval @xmath89 free-@xmath90 , close to the fixed n=4 value .    in figure",
    "[ fig : appb_1 ] , the behavior of the lines representing the full - galaxy ( green ) and disk ( purple ) sizes can be explained in terms of the host galaxy morphology .",
    "the slight predominance of disks below @xmath91 is seemingly related to the larger fraction of disk galaxies in the lower end of our mass interval ( see figure [ fig : morphology ] ) .",
    "the prevalence of ellipticals at the high mass end generates a drop in the disk sizes .",
    "1 galaxies .",
    "the galaxies hosting compact cores show that the disk / halo accounts for any mass excess above a typical core mass of @xmath92    figure [ fig : appb_2 ] represents alternative fits to the galaxies of the reference elliptical sample . as expected , the disk size is visibly smaller than the full galaxy and even the cores .",
    "note that the cores of these elliptical galaxies are predominantly extended , only 4.5 % of them being compact . for the extended cores ,",
    "the discrepancy between core sizes measured with free - n and n=4 amounts to @xmath93dex , less than half the offset measured for compact cores ( see figure [ fig : appb_1 ] )    finally , figure [ fig : appb_3 ] shows the variation with total mass of the mass fraction contained in the disks and bulges of our two sdss samples : compact cores and reference ellipticals .",
    "as expected from the selection rules , the ellipticals have ( b / t ) @xmath2 1 and nearly all their mass is packed in the extended cores .",
    "galaxies hosting a compact core show a distinct behavior in which the more massive the galaxy is , the more relevant the disk / halo becomes . in the frame of our hypothesis , this behavior is compatible with galaxies having a central , prototypical compact core of @xmath94 , embedded in an accreted disk / halo ( whose mass accounts for any excess above the core mass ) .",
    "in face - on galaxies , contaminant disk light entering the fiber aperture does not contribute to the velocity dispersion broadening of the core ( i.e. dynamical mass ) , but contributes to the core stellar mass .",
    "therefore , disk contaminated cores tend to show an _ unphysical _ @xmath95 . in principle , to minimise disk contamination , we could restrict @xmath63 measurements to cores in which the sdss fiber radius ( 1.5 arcsec ) were smaller than the core effective radius .",
    "this would , however , be a deficient strategy because the core light - profile frequently gets submersed below the disk before attaining its half - light radius .",
    "for instance , cores with @xmath96 1.5 arcsec could still be contaminated . our approach to avoid light contamination is based on the simple fact that disk light originates in much younger stellar populations than those from the core ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "light from a recent star formation event on top of an essentially old core star formation history ( sfh ) is an indication of disk light contamination . instead of using colours",
    ", we adopt the luminosity - weighted age @xmath97 as a more sensitive parameter to detect disk light contamination .",
    "we have carried out a stellar population study in which average ages ( e.g. @xmath97 ) and metallicities are obtained through spectral fitting , using the _ starlight _ synthesis code @xcite to find the optimal mixture of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) that describes a sdss spectrum .",
    "for the present study , the basis ssps correspond to 114 solar - scaled miles models @xcite .",
    "these models have a kroupa universal imf @xcite and span a range of six metallicities , from z / z@xmath98= 1/50 to 1.6 , and 19 different ages , from 0.5 to 12.6 gyr .",
    "the fitting interval spans from 4000 to 5500  , with emission lines and bad pixels being masked out .",
    "the extinction due to foreground dust is modelled with the ccm law @xcite .",
    "since the sdss pipeline does not compute velocity dispersions for spectra with significant emission lines ( as for some disk galaxies ) , we have also used the _ starlight _",
    "spectral fitting to compute our own velocity dispersion values .    , by demanding @xmath99 .",
    "density contours replace the individual points , while connected solid dots represent the median values in @xmath100 bins , with dashed lines outlining the one-@xmath63 rms dispersion around the median . at @xmath100 = 1.0 ,",
    "a rather conservative @xmath101 = 9.05 gyr cutoff value has been obtained . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : contamina ] shows the relation between the @xmath102 and the @xmath103 ratio for a mixed sample of our compact cores and reference ellipticals ( 29,482 ) .",
    "individual points have been replaced by density contours and the connected solid dots represent the median values in bins of @xmath103 , with dashed black lines outlining the one-@xmath63 rms dispersion around the median .",
    "the relation supports the idea that unphysical @xmath104 values are connected to low @xmath105 values , i.e. disk contamination .",
    "a rather conservative cut has been worked out to prevent core contamination , by selecting the @xmath106gyr at which the @xmath103 ratio becomes larger than unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : morphology ] displays one of the most important results of the present study .",
    "however , an alternative perspective to that result is presented here .",
    "using @xmath33 instead of the @xmath107 . in this case ,",
    "figure  [ fig : morpho_mcore ] , the plot shape does not change substantially , but it is roughly shifted with respect to those using @xmath107 .",
    "the mean @xmath108 is 0.25 dex , so morphology fractions of host galaxies with cores in the @xmath109 bin should be compared with those in the @xmath110 bin .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the integrated results of figure  [ fig : morpho_mcore ] are identical to those in table  [ tab : morphotype ] , because the integration mixes all the galaxies with either @xmath111 or @xmath11210.5 ."

    "<S> photometric and dynamic mass - size and mass - density relations are used to show that , in the inner regions of galaxies at @xmath0 , there are _ abundant _ compact cores matching the peculiar properties of the red nuggets , an abundance comparable to that of red nuggets at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the morphology distribution of the present - day galaxies hosting compact cores is used to demonstrate that , in addition to the standard channel connecting red nuggets with elliptical galaxies , a comparable fraction of red nuggets might have ended up embedded in disks . </S>",
    "<S> this result generalises the inside - out formation scenario ; present - day massive galaxies can begin as dense spheroidal cores ( red nuggets ) , around which either a spheroidal halo or a disk are formed later .    </S>",
