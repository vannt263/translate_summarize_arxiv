    "cosmological and astrophysical observations have established that more than @xmath1 of the energy density of our universe is dark matter , a rarely interacting nonbaryonic form of matter , whose specific composition remains unknown  @xcite .",

    "this presents a challenging problem , because even if the coupling of neutralinos ( or other particles ) to quarks is known , it needs to be evaluated at the nucleus level in the nonperturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics  @xcite .",
    "chiral effective field theory ( eft ) provides a systematic expansion for nuclear forces and the coupling to external probes for momenta of order of the pion mass , @xmath2 , which are typical momentum transfers in direct dark matter detection . in this paper , we focus on spin - dependent neutralino scattering off nuclei , which is used to constrain wimp properties  @xcite and is particularly sensitive to nuclear structure .",
