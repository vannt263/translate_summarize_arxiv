    "the efimov effect is very well established and the energies and radii of the infinitely many three - body bound efimov states occur in geometric series corresponding to well defined scaling factors depending on the masses of the particles .",
    "these states have been searched for and found , but only indirectly as enhanced decay probabilities when the two - body interactions are tuned to specific values .",
    "most of these findings are for three identical atoms where the geometric scaling factor is @xmath0 independent of the atomic mass , see for example the experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the occurrence conditions for the efimov effect are that at least two of the three two - body subsystems simultaneously interact with infinitely large scattering lengths , or equivalently with bound states of zero energy .",
    "the necessary fine - tuning is most easily achieved when at least two of the particles are identical .",
    "then obviously at least two subsystems are identical and therefore simultaneously fine - tuned in an experiment .",
    "if furthermore one of the particles is distinctly different , the scaling factors can differ enormously for the resulting efimov spectra .",
    "when the system has one light and two heavy particles , the scaling factor , or the energy spacing , is very small .",
    "this is a huge advantage since many energies then are within the experimentally accessible range .",
    "the opposite case of one heavy and two light particles has correspondingly large energy spacing and fewer accessible states .",
    "the two - component gases , where mass - imbalanced three - body systems are likely to recombine in the decay process into a deeply bound dimer and a third particle , are more difficult to prepare in sufficiently cold tunable states . however , several systems are now investigated experimentally @xcite and probably more are in the pipeline .",
    "it is therefore very timely to investigate these processes theoretically @xcite in more details and more systematically than done before , where one of the foci has been on the special case of vanishing scattering length between the two similar particles , see for example @xcite .",
    "we shall in this paper only consider negative scattering lengths where the final state in the recombination product is a deeply bound dimer , unavailable in usual zero - range three - body models .",
    "the theoretical formulation is simplest for three equal masses , since then the single , and necessarily large , scattering length is the only parameter which therefore completely determines the properties of the process . the two - component system is much more complicated , since two scattering lengths and one mass ratio are the necessary parameters to characterize the system .",
    "the scaling factor is very well known as function of masses in the limit of very large scattering lengths @xcite , that is when both are infinitely large and when only that of the non - equal particles is large while the third between identical particles is vanishingly small .",
    "these two extreme limits of different scalings between energies would lead to different periodicities in the enhanced recombination probability as function of the scattering lengths .",
    "any intermediate energy scaling is also possible , and a smooth transition between these limits arises by varying the third scattering length between zero and infinity .",
    "one established method is based on a multiple scattering approach where the final state somehow is simulated although never directly present .",
    "recently a novel suggestion appeared to use an optical model to describe absorption as in nuclear physics and for light waves in materials .",
    "this formulation can only provide decay , or absorption , probability without any details of the final states populated in these processes .",
    "however , this is all we need to describe the measurable recombination probabilities . in the present report",
    "we shall elaborate and explore the properties of this optical model .",
    "the overall purpose of the present paper is to discuss three - body recombination processes in atomic gases .",
    "the emphasis is on two - component atomic gases where mass - imbalanced recombination processes are prominent and probably dominating .",
    "this shall be done by introducing the details of a simple optical model where the real part is the lowest adiabatic hyper - spherical potential , and the imaginary part is a square well in hyper - radius .",
    "the initial zero - range potential must be regularized to provide physical results .",
    "this is achieved by replacing the diverging real part with a constant at small hyper - radii where the imaginary part also is finite .",
    "this constant is unimportant for the calculated recombination rates .",
    "such an optical model formulation is phenomenological by nature , but we shall indicate a possible relation to universally determined values of the model parameters .    the paper is structured with basic definitions in section ii , while the focus on computation of mass - imbalanced three - body recombinations is formulated in details in section iii .",
    "the choice and dependence on physical as well as model parameters are discussed in section iv .",
    "precise comparison to available experimental results is the content of section v. finally , we summarize a number of conclusions in section vi , where we also suggest interesting future research projects .",
    "in this section we sketch the details necessary to calculate the potential which provides the wave functions for recombination computations .",
    "the first part describes the adiabatic expansion method and the dependence on masses and scattering length parameters for a short - range real potential .",
    "the second part discusses the extension to an optical potential by addition of a complex term .",
    "we utilize the formalism developed in @xcite to treat the 3-body problem at low energies .",
    "the particle coordinates and masses are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively for @xmath3 .",
    "we describe the three - body system by hyper - spherical coordinates where the all - important hyper - radius is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the jacobi - coordinates , @xmath7 @xmath8 with an arbitrary normalization mass , @xmath9 , which in the present work is chosen to be the mass of the lightest particle , unless something else is explicitly stated . the first term in the hyper - spherical expansion is known to give fairly accurate results @xcite .",
    "this is provided the excitation energy is less than the energy difference between states build on first and second adiabatic potential .",
    "if we extract the radial phase - space factor , the total wave function , @xmath10 , is approximated by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the other five hyper - spherical coordinates . the hyper - radial wave - equation to determine @xmath13",
    "is then given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the procedure to determine @xmath15 is described in details in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the adiabatic hyper - spherical expansion method amounts to fixing the hyperradius and solving the three faddeev equations in the space of the five dimensionless coordinates , @xmath12 .",
    "all partial angular momenta are zero corresponding to @xmath17-wave spherical harmonics solutions for the angles describing the directions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in all three jacobi - coordinate sets .",
    "we are therefore left with the three coupled faddeev equations describing the relative sizes of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for zero - range two - body interactions these differential equations",
    "can be reduced to three linear algebraic equations with non - trivial solutions only when the corresponding @xmath20 matrix , @xmath21 , has vanishing determinant @xcite , @xmath22 which determines the angular eigenvalue , @xmath15 .",

    "the second factor equal to zero is equivalent to the well - known equation for @xmath34 @xcite @xmath35 where all indices are omitted for this case of identical bosons .",
    "the other case of interest is two identical and one distinguishable particle .",
    "we label as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : numberconvention ] , that is particles 1 and 3 are identical ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "the characteristic equation then reduces to @xmath41 where the last factor provides the general physical solution , which receives contributions from all three interacting pairs .",
    "non - interacting particles @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to vanishing scattering length , @xmath42 , where only two interactions contribute .",
    "then @xmath43 and the second factor in eq.([eq : massimbalancednu ] ) reduces to @xmath44 , which explicitly amounts to @xmath45)}{\\sin(2 \\phi_{13})}=\\frac{\\rho}{\\sqrt{\\mu_1 } a_{12}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\nu \\pi}{2}\\right).\\ ] ] in all the calculations of @xmath34 we only use the smallest non - trivial solution to the eqs.([eq : samemassnu ] ) , ( [ eq : massimbalancednu ] ) and ( [ eq : massimbalancednua2zero ] ) .",
    "this selects the lowest adiabatic potential in the hyper - spherical expansion .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath15 depends on the ratios of hyper - radius to the different scattering lengths .    when @xmath46 the purely imaginary solutions , @xmath47 , become independent of @xmath16 , where @xmath48 depends on the masses and the number of contributing interactions .",
    "the radial equation in eq.([eq : hyperradialequation ] ) has then infinitely many bound solutions , the efimov three - body states , with energies , @xmath49 , related by @xmath50 where we generally refer to @xmath17 as the efimov scaling .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath17 in particular depends on the number of contributing subsystems . in practical comparison with measurements",
    "this means that we can expect @xmath17 to take any value between the values of the two extreme limits of two or three contributing subsystems .",
    "we are interested in modelling the recombination for negative values of all the scattering lengths , that is in the regime where no two - body bound states exist within the present zero - range model .",
    "we therefore need to introduce the final dimer states populated in the final state of the three - body recombination process . however , the only information we need is the rate of population , or equivalently the rate at which the three - body system disappears .",
    "no details of the final states are required , and the optical model is perfect for this purpose @xcite .",
    "this model has recently been employed to describe three - body recombination of identical bosons @xcite .",
    "we add an imaginary part to the adiabatic hyper - radial potential in eq.([eq : hyperradialequation ] ) leading to non - hermiticity and non - conservation of probability .",
    "thus we can describe the time - dependent probability reduction as an absorption process , since recombination is removal of probability from the initial three - body system .",
    "this is then directly aiming for calculation of the absorption rate .",
    "the recombination process occurs when all three particles simultaneously are close in space and two can merge into a dimer , while the third is necessary to conserve energy and momentum .",
    "the hyper - radius is an appropriate and convenient measure of average distance between the three particles , see eq.([eq : hypersphericalcoord ] ) .",
    "we therefore modify the potential in eq.([eq : hyperradialequation ] ) at small distances , @xmath51 , by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constants characterizing the optical potential , @xmath55 .",
    "this structure regularizes the otherwise diverging , for @xmath56 , real part of the potential by using a @xmath16-independent constant for @xmath51 .",
    "the solution , @xmath57 , to eq.([eq : hyperradialequation ] ) is that of a complex square well for @xmath58 , that is @xmath59 where both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are complex quantities .",
    "this solution can conveniently be used as initial condition in the numerical solution for an integration starting in @xmath53 .     and @xmath62 .",
    "for values @xmath63 it corresponds to the adiabatic potential for identical bosons . at smaller @xmath16",
    "it has a constant real value corresponding to the value of the adiabatic potential in @xmath53 .",
    "the blue lines correspond to some of the bound states of the @xmath64 potential .",
    "the dotted red line illustrates a possible resonant state at positive energy .",
    "the scale of this illustration is unphysical , since the value of @xmath65 in actual calculations tends to be much smaller relative to the value of @xmath16 where the potential has a maximum . ]",
    "a schematic illustration of the real part of the potential is shown for three identical bosons on fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalmodel ] .",
    "this potential has a short - distance attractive region , a barrier of height @xmath66 located at @xmath67 , and a decrease towards zero as @xmath68 , where the latter can be seen from eq.([eq : hyperradialequation ] ) with @xmath69 obtained from eq.([eq : samemassnu ] ) , since @xmath70 in the limit of @xmath71 .",
    "the small distance attractive behavior outside @xmath65 , but inside the barrier , is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "such a potential produces a number of bound three - body states , which only is limited by the finite value of @xmath61 for @xmath73 .",
    "the energies of these states are related through the scaling in eq.([energyscale ] ) .",
    "physically we can think of the recombination process as related to the probability of reaching the absorptive small distances by tunneling through the barrier .",
    "the recombination probability is then substantially enhanced when one of these states has an energy equal to the total three - body energy .",
    "the scattering length is decisive for potential and bound state energies . in particular , for three identical bosons we define @xmath74 as the value for which a bound state appears with zero energy .",
    "the recombination probability consequently peaks for the same , very small , energy close to zero when @xmath75 .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 turns out to determine the value @xmath74 , whereas the strength parameter @xmath54 determines the shape and size of this recombination peak as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "the potential described in the previous section now has to be used to calculate the rate of probability disappearing in the different three - body channels .",
    "we first define formally the different channels and rates , then we describe how to compute these rates , first by the traditional method employed for identical particles , and in the last subsection we discuss a new method intuitively related to the optical model .      for mass - imbalanced recombination",
    "the rate equations for the loss - rates are more complicated than for the mass - balanced case . for two components with densities @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we can have three - body systems with one distinguishable and two identical particles . in total",
    "we then have 4 different possible recombination processes , and we can in principle find the time derivative of either of the two particle densities which leads to 6 different recombination coefficients , denoted @xmath79 , that is @xmath80 @xmath81 here the indices 1 and 2 refer to the two different kinds of particles in a two - component gas .",
    "the first term in eqs.([eq : rateequationalpha1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rateequationalpha2 ] ) corresponds to the recombination coefficient for identical particles , whereas the last two terms correspond to the two mass - imbalanced recombinations .",
    "we shall in the following formal derivations often imagine the example of a cs - li gas where cs is particle 1 and li particle 2 .",
    "then @xmath82 corresponds to the recombination process between two particles of type 1 and one particle of type 2 , and the rate relates to the change in the particle density of type 1 .",
    "analogously for other sub- and superscripts .",
    "the rate equations only describe how many particles disappear from a three - body system .",
    "the final state is not specified .",
    "we could attempt to further split the mass - imbalanced recombinations into two types depending on the final structure of which particles form the dimer , that is @xmath83 however , the optical model does not allow distinction between final states , and there is also currently no way to distinguish the two channels experimentally .",
    "thus , @xmath84 is the full recombination coefficient corresponding to the sum of these different dimer productions .",
    "it is obviously much more difficult to find @xmath85 and @xmath86 from eqs.([eq : rateequationalpha1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rateequationalpha2 ] ) than solving one much simpler equation corresponding to a gas of identical bosons .",
    "however , we assume the coefficients @xmath84 are density and time - independent , and we are able to calculate these coefficients directly from the radial equation in the optical model - modified eq.([eq : hyperradialequation ] ) .",
    "also experimental analyses are more direct by measuring the loss of individual particles as function of time .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to find the full time dependence from eqs.([eq : rateequationalpha1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rateequationalpha2 ] ) .",
    "it is , however , reassuring to estimate the time - scale at which the numerically computed values of @xmath84 make sense .",
    "let us first assume that we have a single - species gas corresponding to the equation @xmath87 .",
    "the solution is @xmath88 this square root dependence holds for the single - species gas . with typical experimental parameters for the density @xcite",
    ", we find that @xmath77 is reduced by a factor of @xmath89 over a time period varying from about half a second to a few nanoseconds as the scattering length changes from -100@xmath90 to -20000@xmath90 , where @xmath90 is the bohr radius .",
    "we used here the values of @xmath91 obtained in the calculations reported in details in a later section of this paper .",
    "let us then consider eq.([eq : rateequationalpha1 ] ) but with @xmath78 varying slowly enough to assume it is constant . if now the @xmath82 recombination is dominant , we get the solution @xmath92 under these assumptions , we get a half - life ranging from a few milliseconds to a few nanoseconds as the @xmath93 scattering length grows from -100@xmath90 to -10000@xmath90 .",
    "these numbers correspond to a cs - li gas , where the densities are obtained from the experiment @xcite and the values of @xmath82 are from calculations reported later in this paper .",
    "if the last term is dominating in eq.([eq : rateequationalpha1 ] ) we get analogously an exponential time dependence , that is @xmath94 using the densities obtained from the experiment @xcite , this half - life ranges from about 150 seconds to a few milliseconds as the @xmath93 scattering length increase from about -100@xmath90 to -10000@xmath90 .",
    "the relatively large half - life here reflects the small values of @xmath95 , which are from calculations reported later in this paper .",
    "we shall return with more discussion on calculated values and relative sizes of the recombination coefficients in eqs.([eq : rateequationalpha1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rateequationalpha2 ] ) . in general ,",
    "our results for the rate coefficients , @xmath84 , combined with our simple approximate solutions give realistic time - scales compared to experimental conditions .",
    "when analysing the data in a given experiment , a variety of methods are used .",
    "some involve a numerical solution of an equation similar to eq.([eq : rateequationalpha1 ] ) @xcite , while some are more elaborate taking the experimental variation of the temperature with time into account @xcite .    in theoretical calculations",
    "we generally find the probability loss per unit time for a single three - body system , denoted @xmath96 , which will be refereed to as the recombination rate . from this the probability loss of single particles involved in the recombination can be found .",
    "let us look at the particle loss , corresponding to the terms in eq.([eq : rateequationalpha1 ] ) .",
    "the number of particles @xmath31 lost per unit time , @xmath97 , from one three - body system is respectively @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the ( 1 - 1 - 1 ) , ( 1 - 1 - 2 ) and ( 2 - 2 - 1 ) systems .",
    "the total number of three - body systems is respectively @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the ( 1 - 1 - 1 ) , ( 1 - 1 - 2 ) and ( 2 - 2 - 1 ) systems .",
    "equivalent arguments hold for eq.([eq : rateequationalpha2 ] ) and thus we find the total particle loss per unit time to be @xmath104 the values @xmath96 depend on the volume in which the three - body systems are confined , and to obtain the @xmath84 coefficients , we need to transform to densities using the identity @xmath105 . by insertion of this in eqs.([eq : rateequationj1],[eq : rateequationj2 ] ) and comparison with eqs.([eq : rateequationalpha1],[eq : rateequationalpha2 ] ) this yields the following relation between recombination rates and recombination coefficients : @xmath106 the indices are necessary to distinguish between the four different three - body systems .",
    "the quantity @xmath107 , is then independent of the volume , under the assumption that the volume is sufficiently large .",
    "the volume used in theoretical calculations and the volume corresponding to specific experiments are not the same , but @xmath107 should be the same and thus it is the quantity for which comparisons between experiment and theory is meaningful .",
    "the difference between @xmath107 and the recombination coefficients is the factors related to the number of three - body systems and particles lost per three - body recombination , all of which have been accounted for in eq.([eq : alpha111])-eq.([eq : alpha221 ] ) . for a non - bec gas",
    "there is also a multiplicative symmetry - factor corresponding to the number of particle permutations @xmath108 , as described in @xcite , but for a bec - gas this symmetry factor disappears @xcite . for three identical particles @xmath109 , while for two identical particles and one distinguishable particle @xmath110 .    in the following two sections , two methods of calculating @xmath96 for any three - body system",
    "is derived . in order to ease the notation the subscripts on @xmath111 and @xmath61",
    "are omitted .",
    "the recombination rate @xmath111 for a given three - body system is defined from the missing probability after scattering on the optical potential in eq.([eq : opticalpotential ] ) .",
    "let us assume the three - body wave - function asymptotically is expressed in jacobi coordinates as a three - dimensional plane wave normalized in a box of volume , @xmath61 .",
    "we expand this wavefunction in hyper - harmonic free solutions , that is @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the jacobi momenta characterizing the wave function , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 denote the five hyper - angles associated with the directions of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the three - body energy is then defined by @xmath117 the arguments of the two hyperspherical harmonics , @xmath118 , are related to the spatial and momentum coordinates , respectively .",
    "the collection of angular quantum numbers are denoted @xmath119 , where we only need to specify the hyper - momentum quantum number , @xmath120 .",
    "the kinetic energy eigenvalue corresponding to the free wave - function is @xmath121 and at asymptotically large values of @xmath16 related to the eigenvalue of the adiabatic potentials as @xmath122 .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath15 for the lowest adiabatic potential is 2 , corresponding to @xmath123 .",
    "the radial dependence is given in terms of the spherical bessel function , @xmath124 , of order @xmath125 .",
    "the hyper - harmonics are normalized to unity @xmath126 where the delta - function express that all quantum numbers pairwise must be equal .",
    "the large - distance asymptotics , @xmath127 , is then obtained from the bessel function , that is @xcite @xmath128 { }   \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi \\kappa \\rho } } \\frac{e^{i \\kappa \\rho - i\\varphi_k } + e^{- i \\kappa \\rho + i \\varphi_k}}{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath129 .",
    "the two terms in eq.([asym ] ) correspond to in- and out - going hyper - sperical waves , respectively .",
    "we now introduce a short - range optical potential and a unit amplitude on the in - coming wave .",
    "the absolute value of the out - going amplitude is then asymptotically allowed to differ from unity . from eqs.([eq : planewavexpansion ] ) and ( [ asym ] ) we then obtain the asymptotic from the @xmath123 wave function , that is @xmath130 where @xmath131 , since the optical potential acts as a sink of probability .",
    "the hyper - radial current is defined by @xmath132    using eqs.([eq : asymptotick0 ] ) and ( [ eq : fluxdensity ] ) the missing current , @xmath133 , is calculated for a given value of @xmath134 .",
    "this amounts to @xmath135 to get the probability loss per unit time , @xmath111 , we need to integrate the missing current over the hyper - surface .",
    "the surface element must correspond to the physical volume element ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the volume element is thus given by ( see eqs.([eq : jaccord ] ) and ( [ eq : reducedmass ] ) ) : @xmath136 where we do not have to distinguish between choice of jacobi coordinates , since the mass factor is symmetric under exchange of @xmath137 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . to take into account the degeneracy of the initial states for a given @xmath60 we need to average over @xmath116 , which we do by integrating over the angles and dividing by @xmath138 .",
    "for a given @xmath60 ( or energy ) , and under the assumption that we are at large values of @xmath16 , we then get @xmath139 exploiting the orthonormality of the hyperspherical harmonics , the missing probability per unit time is then @xmath140 in order to obtain the recombination coefficients we must multiply by @xmath141 .",
    "this gives @xmath142 which corresponds to the general formula for n - body loss given in @xcite .      in this section",
    "we present an alternate way to obtain the recombination rate @xmath111 for the three - body system .",
    "this is done by deriving the decay rate of bound states in the optical potential .",
    "first we define the bound states in a large box with hyper - radius extending from zero to @xmath143 .",
    "the boundary condition is that the wave function is zero at the edge of the box , that is @xmath144 .",
    "the eigenvalues for the optical potential are complex numbers @xmath145 the imaginary component of the energy describes the decay rate of the probability as seen from the time evolution of the wave - function , defined by @xmath146    the decay rates described by @xmath147 are three - body energies determined by a box boundary condition .",
    "the overall energy dependence is then a strong decrease , inversely proportional to the hyper - radial three - body volume , towards zero as function of box radius @xmath143 . in order to obtain the recombination coefficient @xmath148",
    "we then need to know @xmath61 .",
    "this volume , @xmath61 , is defined by equating two ways of calculating the density of three - body states in the hyper - spherical box extending to @xmath143 .",
    "the first is the formal expression of integration over given intervals of coordinates and conjugate momenta , where @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the second is direct numerical calculation of the same quantity from the solutions to the hyper - radial equation .",
    "the resulting equation is then @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the volume for the jacobi coordinates , @xmath153 is the volume element per unit energy in momentum space , and @xmath154 is the density of states for a given energy , @xmath155 , defined by eq.([eq : threebodyenergy ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath156 is plancks constant , which is the volume occupied by each quantum state .    using eq.([eq : jacobivolume ] )",
    "we express @xmath157 in terms of the physical volume , @xmath61 , that is @xmath158    using eqs.([eq : phasespace ] ) , ( [ eq : threebodyenergy ] ) and ( [ volvol ] ) we then get @xmath159 where the value of @xmath160 can be found from solving the hyper - radial equation numerically .",
    "we emphasize that the lowest hyper - radial equation only accounts for both total and partial - wave angular momentum zero states , while the employed phase - space identity includes all states , independent of angular momentum .",
    "the derived relations therefore strongly assume excitation energies sufficiently small to exclude contributions from all solutions build on the repulsive higher - lying adiabatic potentials .",
    "the squared volume @xmath141 scales as @xmath161 , and meaningful recombination coefficients , independent of box size , are therefore only achieved when @xmath162 is proportional to @xmath163 .",
    "this is very demanding for numerical calculations , since convergence only is achieved when @xmath143 is larger than the scattering lengths .",
    "the recombination coefficients , expressed in terms of @xmath162 , are then found from @xmath164 eq.([eq : recgamma ] ) is equal to eq.([eq : recs ] ) then .",
    "this leads to the immediate conclusion that for an energy @xmath155 corresponding to an allowed eigenvalue the following relation between the parameters in the two methods should hold @xmath165      one immediate conclusion which is readily obtained from eq.([eq : alpha111])- eq.([eq : alpha221])is that @xmath166 which is reassuring , as for example one particle of type 2 disappears for each particle of type 1 in the 1 - 1 - 2 recombination . for identical particles the mass factor in @xmath167 ( eq.([eq : recs ] ) and eq.([eq : recgamma ] ) ) reduces to @xmath168 , where @xmath2 is the physical mass .",
    "numerically , we find that the tunnelling probability @xmath169 ( for an analytical estimate of this , see @xcite ) and the decay rate @xmath162 depends on the physical mass as @xmath170 , however , leading to the identity @xmath171 .",

    "the largest allowed hyper - radius must be at a hyper - radius where the real potential precisely has the inverse radial square behavior .",

    "however , this does not say much , since a small change in magnetic field results in a huge change in the scattering length , see eq.([eq : feshbach1 ] ) and eq.([eq : feshbach ] ) . due to this , it is also hard to determine an accurate @xmath53 value which reproduces the very weak third peak .",
    "the two predicted peaks in the two fits are at the edge allowed by the experimental uncertainty , and as such they are still very close to the observed values .",
    "the finite temperature effects are also likely to move the locations slightly , which might explain smaller deviation",
    ".    we can now calculate the inter - species scattering lengths corresponding to the experimental peak values by using eq.([eq : feshbach1 ] ) with @xmath213 , which yields @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "this gives a efimov scaling of 4.8911 between the first two peaks and 4.7980 between the last two peaks .",
    "these values are in agreement with the efimov scaling found by going to the universal limits of infinite scattering lengths , 4.8766 or 4.7989 , depending on whether there is two or three contributing resonant interactions",
    ".      for identical bosons ref.@xcite proposes a possible relation between the optical model parameters and the van der waals length of the system .",
    "this is motivated by the recent findings in equal mass systems @xcite of a universal relation between the three - body parameter and the two - body van der waals length @xcite .",
    "we can expand this idea to the mass - imbalanced system .",
    "the three van der waals lengths which we will compare with is for cs - cs , li - li and cs - li respectively @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "the crucial parameter is @xmath53 which by definition is a hyper - radius . from the definition in eq.([eq : hypersphericalcoord ] ) we can analogously define a hyper - radial van der waals length as @xmath220 where the distance between particles is replaced by the corresponding two - body van der waals lengths , and the related two - body reduced masses , @xmath221 and @xmath222 , are introduced and @xmath181 .    for identical particles with @xmath9 equal to the mass of the particles ,",
    "this hyper - radius reduces to the van der waals length , @xmath223 , which in ref.@xcite was compared to @xmath53 by simple division . for three identical particles we find respectively @xmath224 and @xmath225 with the parameters for cs - cs - cs and li - li - li",
    ".    for the mass - imbalanced system the ( identical ) interactions between the heavy and the two light particles",
    "is as dicussed expected to be the dominating contribution .",
    "this means that the last term in eq.([eq : rholength ] ) should be the largest while the first term should vanish when the corresponding scattering length , @xmath182 , between the identical heavy particles is relatively small .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath182 is finite and begins to contribute the recombination peak moves . to keep the peak location independent of @xmath182 we therefore varied @xmath53 slightly with @xmath182 .",
    "this addition to @xmath53 has to come from the first term of eq.([eq : rholength ] ) which should vary from zero to a given finite contribution when @xmath226 .",
    "thus we can parametrize by @xmath227 where we suggest to use @xmath228 . for equal masses and @xmath229",
    "this reduces to eq.[eq : rholength ] for equal masses . for unequal masses",
    "the @xmath230 factor ensures that for @xmath229 , the term still does nt become dominant , in correspondence with the moderate change in @xmath53 , even as big values of @xmath190 were used numerically .",
    "we use @xmath231 , but perhaps a more complicated function is required . for the experimental value , @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) , we then get @xmath234 close to the experimental values for identical particles .    the strength , @xmath54 , can also be compared to the natural unit for a van der waals interaction , @xmath235 . which amounts to @xmath236 for cs - cs - cs , li - li - li , and cs - cs - li , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath237 is constant for a given location and shape in a specific system .",
    "the numerical values from our calculation are for this quantity 31.3600 , 11.4308 , 6.6564 for the systems cs - cs - cs , li - li - li and cs - cs - li .",
    "the upshot of these comparisons is that a possible approximate value of @xmath53 for a system can be obtained by @xmath238 .",
    "in addition the value of @xmath54 to within a factor of two seems obtainable by @xmath239 .",
    "finally the value @xmath237 in different systems are within the same order of magnitude .",
    "we have developed a method for calculating the three - body recombination coefficient of mass - imbalanced three - body systems at negative values of the scattering lengths and for small energies . in order to do this",
    "we employed the hyper - spherical method , zero - range potentials and the faddev decomposition to calculate the lowest - order adiabatic potential .",
    "in addition we formulated and explored the optical model to calculate recombination processes into deep dimers .",
    "this method introduces two phenomenological optical parameters , strength and range , which respectively determine location and shape of the efimov resonances .",
    "we then developed two methods for finding the recombination coefficients of both mass - balanced and mass - imbalanced systems . by means of the traditional s - matrix method and by a new method , where the decay rate of bound states in a box due to the presence of the optical potential is calculated .",
    "in general the results obtained with the two methods are essentially indistinguishable , although differing in numerical inaccuracies .",
    "as they tend to complement each other , we choose the most convenient method in actual calculations .",
    "the model was tested against the experimental data on recombination coefficients in cs - cs - cs and cs - cs - li systems as functions of the feshbach tuned scattering lengths . in both cases , after fitting the range and the strength of the imaginary potential to the first peak , the model was able to describe quantitatively the whole curve including the temperature effects .",
    "the two - parameter fits of strength and hyper - radius of the imaginary part of the optical potential are very efficient for both position and shape of the recombination peaks .",
    "it is also remarkable that the absolute values of the experimental recombination coefficients are reproduced within the experimental uncertainty .    using the developed methods we have reached a number of conclusions .",
    "the main conclusions are that recombination is dominated by the heavy - heavy - light process and mainly determined by the heavy - light scattering length .",
    "but the heavy - heavy scattering length is important for obtaining the correct value of the recombination coefficients , as it enhances the recombination probability and modifies the behaviour as a function of the heavy - light scattering length . for a large mass ratio the efimov scaling",
    "is determined entirely by the heavy - light scattering length , but for a smaller mass ratio finite values of the heavy - heavy scattering length becomes important .",
    "the efimov scaling then moves continuously between values from two and three resonating subsystems .",
    "the focus of this paper has been the case where all scattering lengths are negative , but it could be just as relevant to investigate two negative , one positive or two positive , one negative scattering length cases . since a finite value of the heavy - heavy scattering length can substantially alter the absolute value of a given two - component recombination , it may be interesting to test the three - body recombination for the same system at different feshbach resonances experimentally , in order to further confirm this prediction .    for small mass - ratios",
    "we find a big difference in the efimov scaling between peaks as the heavy - heavy scattering length is increased",
    ". it may be fruitful to investigate the intermediate area between two and three resonant subsystems in more theoretical detail .",
    "in addition a feshbach resonance in a two - component gas with small mass - ratio , in which the heavy - heavy scattering length is big in the same area as the inter - species scattering length would allow investigation of this effect .",
