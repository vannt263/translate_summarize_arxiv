    "mergers of galaxies is a driving factor in their evolution over cosmic times .",
    "several schemes to identify merging galaxy pairs have been developed in the past decade , many based on the number of physically close pairs ( in both sky coordinates as well as redshift ) or on the characterization of the disturbed appearance of galaxies due to gravitational interaction ( often through visual inspection , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both these techniques have been used to determine the interaction fraction in the local universe as well as out to high redshift in hubble images . using n - body simulations ,",
    "one can determine how long a merger will be identified as such by both techniques ; the galaxy pair is close enough , the galaxies look sufficiently disturbed .    because the volume probed increases with redshift",
    ", there were until recently paradoxically better measures of the interaction fraction for higher redshift than for the local universe .",
    "the sdss search for close ( and disturbed looking ) pairs of galaxies @xcite added the valuable local universe interaction fraction , improving on the estimate by @xcite , from close pairs in the uppsala general catalog @xcite .",
    "a compilation of merger fractions determined as a function of redshift is shown in figure [ f : frac ] and table [ t : cites ] .",
    "the scatter in the merger fractions , even for those determined over the same data is striking and it is tied to the definition of what constitutes a pair or disturbed morphology ( see for instance the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the definition of morphologically disturbed became quantified in several schemes of morphological parameterisation schemes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational uncertainties are the time scale a merger is identifiable as one , the completeness of the various samples for each technique and the volumes considered .",
    "similarly , a current substantial theoretical effort is to map the dark matter halo merger rates onto actual observable galaxy mergers ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    ".the reference , data - set , and method for merger fractions in the local and distant universe . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : mrg ]",
    "from the number of galaxies with a companion or the number of disturbed looking galaxies in a given volume ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ) , one can calculate the volume merger rate ( @xmath8 ) , provided one has an estimate of the merger time scale ( @xmath9 ) , the merger rate from pairs ; @xmath10 or the merger rate from morphology @xmath11 . from @xcite , we have an estimate of the _ mean _ merger time scale with some variance due to differences in merger conditions ( type of feedback physics in interstellar matter , type of encounter , and gas masses of the disks ) and perspective ( face - on versus edge - on ) .",
    "@xcite note similarly that time scales depend on mass ratio and gas fraction for optical morphological selection .",
    "mergers were on average visible for 40% of the 2.5 gyr of the merger simulation , making our typical time scale @xmath12 gyr.(see * ? ? ?",
    "* this paper s companion paper . ) , very similar to those used in the literature for morphological selection .",
    "@xcite use a merger time scale for pairs of @xmath13 gyr . the volume represented by the whisp sample",
    "was computed above (  [ s : vol ] ) as 6835 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "following our simple merger fraction of 7% from the number of whisp galaxies with companions in the datacube , we obtain a volume merger rate of @xmath8(pairs ) = @xmath15 mergers mpc@xmath5 gyr@xmath4 .",
    "merger rates based on  morphology can use a variety of selection criteria ( table [ t : mrg ] ) and the merger rate from the concentration-@xmath0 criterion is @xmath8(morph ) = @xmath3 mergers mpc@xmath5 gyr@xmath4 .    in comparison to",
    "the fraction found from galaxy pairs ( 7% ) with the number found from morphology ( 13% ) , both seem to be in reasonable agreement with the morphological selection on the high side .",
    "this is in line with the discrepancy found between pair selection and morphological selection as can be seen in figure [ f : frac ] .",
    "after factoring in the relative timescales a merger is visible as a close pair ( 0.5 gyr * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or above the concentraton-@xmath0 criterion ( @xmath161 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the volume merger rates agree very well : 7 and @xmath3 mergers gyr@xmath4 mpc@xmath5 for paired and morphologically disturbed  disks respectively .",
    "the whisp sample represents only a very small volume of the universe and the resulting merger fraction and rates are uncertain as a result of that .",
    "however , the reasonable consistency with much larger samples such as the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ f : frac ] ) are cause for optimism as  morphology as a tracer of the merger fraction and rate of galaxies .",
    "volume merger rates in the literature for the local universe vary somewhat with sample and survey .",
    "@xcite finds for luminous red galaxies in sdss a volume merger rate of@xmath17 = @xmath18 gpc@xmath5 gyr@xmath4 = @xmath19 h@xmath14 mpc@xmath5 gyr@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite found for galaxies of all types in the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) a volume merger rate of @xmath17 = @xmath20 h@xmath14 mpc@xmath5 gyr@xmath4 , and @xcite find a volume merger rate for all galaxy types based on sdss and mgc of @xmath17 = @xmath21 h@xmath14 mpc@xmath5 gyr@xmath4 for _ major _ mergers .",
    "in contrast , we find a volume merger rate of @xmath8(morph ) = @xmath22 mergers h@xmath14 mpc@xmath5 gyr@xmath4 ( h = 0.73 or @xmath23=73 km / s / mpc ) , an order of magnitude more than those above . since our merger fractions are similar within a factor two to those in the literature for the local universe , the issue for the volume merger rate would either have to be the inferred whisp volume , the timescale or a bias in the selection of galaxies .",
    "the merger time scale is unlikely to be the issue .",
    "the visibility time of the merger starts earlier in  than in the stellar perspective but it is not substantially different from what other authors have found .",
    "substituting any other visibility time - scale from the literature for morphological or pair selection would not reduce the merger rate ( selection times are typically less or equal to @xmath2 1 gyr ) .",
    "we are more sensitive to minor mergers and the implied shorter visibility time - scales but this is unlikely to be an order of magnitude effect .",
    "alternatively , we may have to consider the possibility that the morphologically disturbed galaxies are not all gravitationally disturbed but may suffer from effects unique to the gas perspective , for example ram - pressure stripping affecting the appearance of the  disk .",
    "compared to the observed fraction of mergers from other sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for the sdss ) , this is of order a factor two discrepancy .",
    "the agreement between volume merger rates from whisp from the pairs and morphology contradict this however .",
    "the whisp volume estimate is a likely source of the discrepancy as it is the most uncertain of our numbers .",
    "however , even with the naive , larger estimate of the whisp volume ( @xmath24 mpc@xmath14 ) , this is only a factor three , not an order of magnitude .",
    "the whisp selection process favours late - type galaxies ( figure [ f : type ] ) and local small irregular galaxies ( to complement the spirals ) and it was never intended as a volume - limited sample . hence an intentional or unintentional selection bias may well have been introduced .",
    "mergers identifiable by their morphology are more likely to happen to the gas - rich late - types and the irregulars are confined to a local smaller volume , and many of them will be tidally affected .",
    "the  perspective is likely to be more sensitive to unequal mass mergers as these can be identified much more readily ( the contrast in gas surface densities is not as great as it is in stellar surface brightness ) .",
    "@xcite points out how one expects a much higher merger fraction in lower - mass systems and @xcite points out that a factor two discrepancy can easily be expected if lower mass systems are included in even a pair statistical analysis .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite identify gas - rich mergers are the most easily identified by their morphology .",
    "therefore , we suspect our result points to a higher merger fraction and volume merger rate for spirals and irregulars in the local universe , and less to a gross error in our whisp volume , merger fraction or the merger time - scale .",
    "if this is the case , merger fractions and rates for at least these types may not evolve with redshift as dramatically as previously thought .",
    "however , to confirm this , one would need a volume - limited large  survey with sufficient resolution and sensitivity for both morphological selection as well as accurate pair identification .",
    "the  perspective can be reliably used in the local universe(z@xmath20 ) , where a spatial resolution can be achieved in large , all - sky surveys ( e.g. , wallaby on askap , koribalski et al . _ in prep . _ and wnshis on wsrt , jzsa et al . in prep . ) but any morphological identification of interacting gas disks at higher redshift will have to wait for ska .",
    "the resolution of the pathfinder instruments ( meerkat and askap ) may well be enough to identify close pairs in the proposed deep surveys ( dingo on askap , @xcite , meyer et al . _ in prep _ , and laduma with meerkat , @xcite , holwerda et al .",
    "_ in prep .",
    "in this paper , we explored the merger fraction and rate based on the  observations of the whisp sample of galaxies .",
    "the sample is still small compared to other local references based on for instance the sdss or the millennium galaxy catalogue @xcite but provides us with an indication how well the  surveys of the near future will perform in this respect . from the quantified morphologies of the whisp column density maps , we conclude :    * the merger fraction in the whisp sample is 7% based on pairs , and 13 % based on disturbed morphology .",
    "these percentages are consistent if one takes into account how long a merger is visible as a close pair of galaxies and how long as a morphologically disturbed  disk .",
    "* assuming the representative volume of the whisp sample is 6835 mpc@xmath14 , and a merger visibility time scale of 1 gyr , the merger rate for our selection criterion is @xmath8(morph ) = @xmath3 mergers gyr@xmath4 mpc@xmath5 in the local universe , very close to the value of @xmath8(pairs ) = @xmath25 mergers gyr@xmath4 mpc@xmath5 for galaxy pairs in whisp .",
    "* while the whisp merger fractions and especially rates mutually agree , the merger rates are much higher than those reported in the literature .",
    "selection effects in the whisp survey , preferring dwarf and irregulars , rather than a gross error in the whisp volume , could well account for the difference as well as variation in the quality of the whisp maps across the sample . upcoming , volume - limited  surveys should provide an accurate measurement of the local merger rate from both  morphology as well as close pairs .",
    "the 21 cm window on the universe is set to revolutionise our understanding of the merger rate of spiral and irregular galaxies as three independent measures of merging or gravitational interaction are available in the data :  morphology , kinematic signatures in  of interaction ( e.g. , lopsidedness of the profile , non - circular motions and an irregular velocity field ) and the easy detection of physically close companions in the  data - cube .    planned  surveys with the ska pathfinder instruments , include an all - sky survey ( wallaby with askap ) and ( wnshis with wsrt / apertif ) , and a medium deep survey to @xmath26 ( dingo ) with askap , and an extremely deep survey ( laduma ) with meerkat . combined ,",
    "these will revolutionise the volume probed with  and help shed light on the merger fraction using all three tracers ; morphological , dynamic and pair identification in the local universe surveys , and dynamical and close pairs identification our to higher redshift .",
