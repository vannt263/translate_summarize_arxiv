    "rather , the photon field displaces its charged constituents , inducing a non - vanishing multipole - moment .",
    "these nucleon - structure effects have in fact been known for many decades and ( in the case of a proton target ) quite reliable theoretical calculations for the deviations from the powell cross - section exist .",
    "they are canonically parameterised starting from the most general interaction between the nucleon @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 and an electro - magnetic field of fixed , non - zero energy @xmath6 : @xmath7\\;n \\end{split}\\ ] ] here , the electric or magnetic ( @xmath8 ) photon undergoes a transition @xmath9 of definite multipolarity @xmath10 ; @xmath11 , and the coefficients are the _ energy - dependent _ or _ dynamical polarisabilities _ of the nucleon .",
    "most prominently , there are six dipole - polarisabilities : two spin - independent ones ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) for electric and magnetic dipole - transitions which do not couple to the nucleon - spin ; and in the spin - sector , two diagonal ( `` pure '' ) spin - polarisabilities ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and two off - diagonal ( `` mixed '' ) spin - polarisabilities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in addition , there are negligible contributions from higher ones like quadrupole polarisabilities , see sect .",
    "[ sec : spin ] .",
    "polarisabilities measure hence the global stiffness of the nucleon s internal degrees of freedom against displacement in an electric or magnetic field of definite multipolarity and non - vanishing frequency @xmath6 .",
    "they contain detailed information about the constituents because they lead to quite different dispersive effects : there are low - lying nuclear resonances like the @xmath18 , the charged meson - cloud around the nucleon , internal relaxation effects , etc .",
    "spin - polarisabilities are particularly interesting as they parameterise the response of the nucleon-_spin _ to the photon field , having no classical analogon .",
    "it must be stressed that dynamical polarisabilities are a concept complementary to _ generalised _ polarisabilities . the latter probe the nucleon in virtual compton scattering , i.e.  with an incoming photon of zero energy and non - zero virtuality , and can provide information about the spatial distribution of charge and magnetism inside the nucleon . _ dynamical polarisabilities _ on the other hand test the global response of the internal nucleonic degrees of freedom to a",

    "nucleon compton scattering provides thus a wealth of information about the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "however , in contradistinction to many other electro - magnetic processes , the nucleon - structure effects probed in compton scattering have not been analysed in terms of a multipole - expansion at fixed energies . instead ,",
    "most experiments have focused on just two parameters , namely the static electric and magnetic polarisabilities @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are also often for brevity called `` the polarisabilities '' of the nucleon .",
    "therefore , quite different theoretical frameworks are at present able to provide a consistent , qualitative picture for the leading static polarisabilities .",

    "different types of experiments report a range of values @xmath23 $ ] , and even less is known about the spin - polarisabilities .",
    "these notes give an overview how combining recent theoretical advances with data from the new generation of high - precision compton scattering experiments also with polarised beams and targets can offer fresh , detailed insight into these problems : we define dynamical polarisabilities and study their low - energy contents in sect .",

    "section  [ sec : spin ] proposes to extract their energy - dependence and simultaneously determine the ill - known spin - polarisabilities by polarised experiments .",
    "finally , an accurate determination of the neutron polarisabilities from deuteron compton scattering is reported in sect .",
    "[ sec : deuteron ] .",
    "a rigorous definition of energy - dependent or dynamical polarisabilities starts instead of ( [ polsfromints ] ) from the six independent amplitudes into which the @xmath24-matrix of real compton scattering is decomposed : @xmath25    \\\\ & &    + { \\mathrm{i}}\\,a_6(\\omega , z)\\;\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot    \\left[\\left(\\vec{\\epsilon}\\,'^*\\times\\hat{\\vec{k}}'\\right)\\ ,      ( \\vec{\\epsilon}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{k } } ' ) -\\left(\\vec{\\epsilon }        \\times\\hat{\\vec{k } } \\right)\\ ,      ( \\vec{\\epsilon}\\,'^*\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{k}})\\right]{\\nonumber}\\ ] ] here , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the unit - vector in the momentum direction of the incoming ( outgoing ) photon with polarisation @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 the scattering angle , @xmath31 .",
    "we separate these amplitudes into a pole - part and a non - pole or structure - part @xmath32 .",
    "intuitively , one could define the pole - part as the one which leads to the powell cross - section of a point - like nucleon with anomalous magnetic moment and thus parameterises all we hope to have understood about the nucleon .",
    "then , it would seem , the structure - part contains all information about the internal degrees of freedom which make the nucleon an extended , polarisable object .",
    "however , the question which part a contribution belongs to can not be answered uniquely . in the following ,",
    "only those terms which have a pole either in the @xmath33- , @xmath34- or @xmath35-channel are treated as non - structure , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "this means for example that the large contribution to the spin - polarisabilities from the @xmath36-vertex via a @xmath37-pole in the @xmath35-channel is not part of the polarisabilities thus defined . in the calculation of observables ,",
    "such a separation is clearly irrelevant because the structure - dependent and structure - independent part must be summed . here",
    ", however , we investigate the rle of the _ internal _ nucleonic degrees of freedom for the polarisabilities .",
    "they are contained only in the structure - part of the amplitudes .",
    "we also choose to work in the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "thus , @xmath6 denotes the cm - energy of the photon , @xmath38 the nucleon mass , and @xmath39 the total cm - energy .",
    "following older work on the multipole - decomposition of the compton amplitudes and pulling a kinematical factor out relative to ( [ polsfromints ] ) , one obtains for the expansion of the _ structure - parts _ of the amplitudes in terms of polarisabilities @xmath40\\,\\omega^2+\\dots   , \\nonumber \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\bar{a}_2(\\omega,\\,z ) { \\displaystyle}=-\\frac{4\\pi\\,w}{m}\\,\\beta_{m1}(\\omega)\\,\\omega^2    + \\dots   , \\nonumber    \\\\[1ex ]    \\bar{a}_3(\\omega,\\,z ) & { \\displaystyle}=-\\frac{4\\pi\\,w}{m}\\,\\left[\\gamma_{e1e1}(\\omega )      + z\\,\\gamma_{m1m1}(\\omega)+\\gamma_{e1m2}(\\omega )      + z\\,\\gamma_{m1e2}(\\omega)\\right]\\,\\omega^3+\\dots   , \\nonumber    \\\\[1ex ]    \\bar{a}_4(\\omega,\\,z ) & { \\displaystyle}=\\frac{4\\pi\\ , w}{m}\\,\\left[-\\gamma_{m1m1}(\\omega )      + \\gamma_{m1e2}(\\omega)\\right]\\,\\omega^3+\\dots   , \\label{eq : strucamp } \\\\[1ex ] \\bar{a}_5(\\omega,\\,z ) & { \\displaystyle}=\\frac{4\\pi\\ ,    w}{m}\\,\\gamma_{m1m1}(\\omega)\\,\\omega^3    + \\dots   , \\nonumber      \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\bar{a}_6(\\omega,\\,z ) = \\frac{4\\pi\\ ,      w}{m}\\,\\gamma_{e1m2}(\\omega)\\,\\omega^3+\\dots   \\ ] ] the various polarisabilities are thus identified _ at fixed energy _ only by their different angular dependence .",
    "clearly , the complete set of dynamical polarisabilities does  like all quantities defined by multipole - decompositions  not contain more or less information about the temporal response or dispersive effects of the nucleonic degrees of freedom than the un - truncated compton amplitudes .",
    "however , the information is more readily accessible and easier to interpret : each mechanism and channel leaves a characteristic signature in the polarisabilities .",
    "moreover , it will turn out that all polarisabilities beyond the dipole ones can be dropped in ( [ eq : strucamp ] ) , as they are so far invisible in observables .",
    "for that reason , they were sacrificed to brevity in the expressions above and purists should consider ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to identify the microscopically dominant low - energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon in a model - independent way , we employ the unique low - energy theory of qcd , namely chiral effective field theory ( @xmath41eft ) .",
    "this extension of chiral perturbation theory to the few - nucleon sector contains only those low - energy degrees of freedom which are observed at the typical energy of the process , interacting in all ways allowed by the underlying symmetries of qcd .",
    "a power - counting allows for results of finite , systematically improvable accuracy and thus for an error - estimate . the resulting contributions at leading order , listed in fig .  [ fig : polas ] ,",
    "are easily motivated :    ( )    photons couple to the charged pion cloud around the nucleon and around the @xmath42 , signalled by a characteristic cusp at the one - pion production threshold .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath18 as the lowest nuclear resonance can be excited in the intermediate state by the strong @xmath43 @xmath44-transition , leading to a para - magnetic contribution to the static magnetic dipole - polarisability @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "its signal is a characteristic resonance - shape , as in the lorentz model of polarisabilities in classical electro - dynamics .    as the observed static value",
    "@xmath46 is smaller by a factor of @xmath47 than the @xmath42 contribution , a strongly dia - magnetic component must exist .",
    "the resultant fine - tuning at zero photon - energy is unlikely to hold once the evolution of the polarisabilities with the photon energy is considered : if dia- and para - magnetism are of different origin , it is more than likely that they involve different scales and hence different energy - dependences .",
    "therefore , they are apt to be dis - entangled by _ dynamical polarisabilities_. we sub - sume this short - distance physics which is at this order not generated by the pion or @xmath42 into two _ energy - independent _ low - energy coefficients @xmath48 .",

    "as expected , @xmath54 is dia - magnetic .",
    "truncating the multipole - expansion in ( [ eq : strucamp ] ) is justified because the influence of the quadrupole and higher polarisabilities on cross - sections and asymmetries for energies up to about @xmath61 is hardly visible , cf .  figs .",
    "[ fig : protondata ] and [ fig : asyms ] .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath42-contribution is most pronounced at large momentum - transfers , i.e.  backward angles , where even the next - to - leading order calculation without dynamical @xmath42 can not reproduce the steep rise seen in the data as low as @xmath62 .",
    "for that reason , about half of the proton data below @xmath55 were excluded in the analysis leading to the final numbers in @xcite .    with",
    "the parameters now fixed , the energy - dependence of all polarisabilities is predicted . the proton and neutron polarisabilities are very similar in @xmath41eft , iso - vectorial effects being of higher order .",
    "this point will be confirmed also in sect .",
    "[ sec : deuteron ] .",
    "we compare with a result from dispersion theory , in which the dispersive effects are sub - sumed into integrals over experimental input from a different kinematical rgime , namely the photo - absorption cross - section @xmath63 .",
    "its major error - sources are the insufficient neutron data and the uncertainty in modelling the high - energy behaviour of the dispersive integral .",
    "the dipole - polarisabilities show the expected behaviour , and thus no low - energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon are missing .",
    "figure  [ fig : dipolepols ] shows that dynamical effects are large at photon energies of @xmath64 where most experiments to determine polarisabilities are performed . especially at large backward angle , unpolarised and",
    "polarised cross - sections are rather sensitive to the non - analytical structure of the amplitude around the pion cusp and @xmath42-resonance , see figs .",
    "[ fig : protondata ] and [ fig : asyms ] , and  @xcite .",
    "the pion - cusp  clearly seen in the @xmath65-polarisabilities  is quantitatively understood already at leading order .",
    "the dipole spin - polarisabilities are predictions , three of them being independent of the parameter - determination . since the mixed spin - polarisabilities ( lower centre and right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dipolepols ] ) are small , the relative uncertainties in both dispersion theory and @xmath41eft are large . while the static polarisabilities are real , the dynamical polarisabilities become complex once the energy in the intermediate state is high enough to create an on - shell intermediate state , the first being the physical @xmath66-continuum , see  @xcite .",
    "most notably is however the strong energy - dependence induced into @xmath13 and all polarisabilities containing an @xmath44 photon even well below the pion - production threshold by the unique signature of the @xmath42 resonance : at @xmath67 mev , @xmath1 is already about @xmath68 units larger than its static value , rendering the traditional approximation of @xmath13 as `` static - plus - small - slope '' @xmath69 inadequate .",
    "this also reveals the good quantitative agreement between the measured value of @xmath70 and the prediction in a @xmath41eft without explicit @xmath42 as accidental : the contribution from the pion - cloud alone is not dispersive enough to explain the energy - dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "one could include higher - order terms in the photon - nucleon interactions which mimic the @xmath42 , but their strengthes are then a - priori un - determined .",
    "furthermore , as the effect is strong , this would in - validate the power - counting at the heart of a model - independent analysis .",
    "when the @xmath42 is included , @xmath71 even changes sign and @xmath72 nearly triples in magnitude .",
    "while the fine details of the rising para - magnetism differ between @xmath41eft and dispersion theory , they are consistent within the uncertainties of the @xmath41eft curve .",
    "the discrepancy between the two schemes above the one - pion production threshold is connected to a derailed treatment of the width of the @xmath42-resonance , which is neglected in leading - one - loop @xmath41eft at low energies .",

    "therefore , three constraints arise on any attempt to explain them microscopically :    ( )    the effect must be @xmath6-independent over a wide range , like @xmath48 .",
    "it must occur in the electric and magnetic scalar polarisabilities , leading to the values for @xmath48 predicted in @xmath41eft , but it must be absent at least in the pure spin - polarisabilities @xmath74 .",
    "its prediction for the proton and neutron must be similar because iso - vectorial effects were shown to be small and energy - independent  @xcite , see also the neutron polarisabilities discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : deuteron ] .",
    "two proposals to explain @xmath48 were put forward : one attributes them to an interplay between short - distance physics and the pion cloud occuring from the next - to - leading order chiral lagrangean  @xcite ; the other to the @xmath35-channel exchange of a meson or correlated two - pion exchange  @xcite .",
