    "the two - parameter birnbaum - saunders ( bs ) distribution , also known as the fatigue life distribution , was introduced by @xcite .",
    "it was originally derived from a model for a physical fatigue process where dominant crack growth causes failure .",
    "a more general derivation was provided by @xcite based on a biological model and relaxing several of the assumptions made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the relationship between the bs distribution and the inverse gaussian distribution .",
    "the author established that the bs distribution can be written as a mixture equally weighted from an inverse gaussian distribution and its complementary reciprocal .",
    "the random variable @xmath0 is said to have a bs distribution with parameters @xmath1 , say @xmath2 , if its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is given by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the standard normal distribution function , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are shape and scale parameters , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath9 is the median of the distribution : @xmath10 . for any constant @xmath11",
    ", it follows that @xmath12 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the reciprocal property holds for the bs distribution : @xmath13 ; see @xcite .",
    "the bs distribution has received considerable attention over the last few years .",
    "@xcite discussed the shape of the hazard function of the bs distribution .",
    "results on improved statistical inference for the bs distribution are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some generalizations and extensions of the bs distribution are presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this distribution has been applied in reliability studies ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and outside this field ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , based on the bs distribution , @xcite introduced the bs autoregressive conditional duration model . @xcite",
    "presented estimators for the unknown parameters of the bs distribution using reference prior .    from @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath14 then @xmath15 has a four - parameter sinh - normal ( shn ) distribution , denoted by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the shape parameters , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the location and scale parameters , respectively . according to @xcite ,",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is also the noncentralty parameter . if @xmath22 , the notation is reduced simply by @xmath23 , and this distribution has a number of interesting properties .",
    "for example , it is symmetric around the mean @xmath24 , it is unimodal for @xmath25 and bimodal for @xmath26 and if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution when @xmath29 . if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 follows the bs distribution with shape parameter @xmath8 and scale parameter @xmath32 , i.e.  @xmath33 .",
    "for this reason , according to @xcite , the shn distribution is also called the log - birnbaum  saunders ( log - bs ) distribution . additionally , according to these authors , the shn and bs models corresponding to a logarithmic distribution and its associated distribution , respectively ( * ? ? ? * ch .",

    ". generalizations of the log - bs regression model introduced by @xcite are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced a skewed shn distribution by replacing the standard normal distribution in equation ( [ rv1 ] ) by the skew - normal ( sn ) distribution @xcite , i.e.  they consider the random variable @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the shape parameter which determines the skewness .",
    "now , the notation used is @xmath37 . from now on",
    ", we shall consider @xmath22 and @xmath38 and hence the notation is given by @xmath39 .",
    "the random variable @xmath31 follows the extended birnbaum  saundres ( ebs ) distribution , with shape parameters @xmath18 and @xmath36 , and scale parameter @xmath32 .",

    "the density function of @xmath42 is given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the standard normal density function , and , as before , we write @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath45th ( @xmath46 ) moment of @xmath15 can be written as @xmath47 thus , the mean of @xmath15 is given by @xmath48 , with @xmath49 plots of the @xmath50 distribution are illustrated in figure [ densities_plots ] for selected parameter values .",
    "the chief goal of this paper is to introduce a skewed log - bs regression model based on the @xmath50 distribution , recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "the proposed regression model is convenient for modeling asymmetric data , and it is an alternative to the log - bs regression model introduced by @xcite when the data present skewness . the article is organized as follows .",

    "these equations can not be solved analytically and statistical software can be used to solve them numerically .",
    "for example , the bfgs method ( see , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) with analytical derivatives can be used for maximizing the log - likelihood function @xmath66 . starting values @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are required .",
    "our suggestion is to use as an initial point estimate for @xmath67 the ordinary least squares estimate of this parameter vector , that is , @xmath86 .",
