    "the muon ionization cooling experiment ( mice ) @xcite , @xcite at rutherford - appleton lab is the first test of the ionization cooling concept for muon beams . to establish muon cooling a high purity muon beam",
    "is positively identified in the momentum range 230 to 350 mev / c by both time - of - flight and cherenkov techniques .",
    "silica aerogel has been successfully used in cherenkov particle identification detectors in the past @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the spherical neutral detector ( snd ) also uses high density silica aerogel @xcite .",
    "based on these and our work with gas threshold cherenkov counters @xcite , we chose high density silica aerogels from the matsushita electric works @xcite for its high quality and hydrophobicity ( water repellant nature ) .",
    "we selected aerogels with indexes of refraction @xmath0=1.07 ( @xmath1=278 mev / c ) and @xmath0=1.12 ( @xmath1=210 mev / c ) , these aerogels nicely filling the gap between gas and liquid radiators for our momentum range .",
    "these high density aerogels scatter heavily in the uv and visible and it is not well known if they can be effectively used for cherenkov radiators . in our work",
    "we compared the scattering and absorptive properties of our high density samples to a commonly used silica aerogel with index @xmath0=1.03 .",
    "the panel sizes were nominally 115  mm x 115  mm x 11.5  mm .",
    "we report on index of refraction , transmission , and scattering measurements , and we measure the light collection yields with particle beams .",
    "the panels are displayed below in fig .  1 .",
    "the index of refraction of the aerogel samples was measured in a straight - forward method using the total internal reflection technique described below . a red laser diode ( 638  nm )",
    "was mounted on a rotating platform with angle scale shown in fig .",
    "we could pinpoint the angle of total internal reflection @xmath2 to a fraction of a degree .",
    "the angle @xmath3 was determined by swiveling the laser beam until the point of total internal reflection ( angle @xmath4 = 90@xmath5 ) . using the relation @xmath6 we determined the index of refraction relating index @xmath0 to angle @xmath3 .",
    "the method has the advantage of yielding a small measurement error @xmath7 once the aerogel block is carefully aligned w.r.t .",
    "the laser beam . due to slight irregularity at the aerogel edge",
    "we could measure the angle @xmath3 to within @xmath8 .",
    "the results are reported in table i.     is adjusted to @xmath9/2 by the method.,width=302 ]    our measurement for the @xmath0=1.03 aerogel ( as certified by matsushita @xcite ) agreed well at wavelength 638  nm . the change in index ( chromatic dispersion ) for the 1.03 aerogel",

    "the efficiencies are about @xmath13% , typical for a diffusely reflecting collection box .",
    "this gives good evidence that the light absorption in the aerogel 1.12 and 1.07 panels is small .",
    "we have made some of the the first measurements on high density aerogel @xmath0=1.07 and @xmath0=1.12 samples , from matsushita , to be used in a beamline cherenkov application . the transmission and scattering properties were investigated and compared to standard @xmath0=1.03 aerogel .",
    "little evidence for strong light absorption in the high density aerogels was found in our test beam exposure , indicating the possibility of further uses of the high density aerogels in particle detector and beamline applications .",
