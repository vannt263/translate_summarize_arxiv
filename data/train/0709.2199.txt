    "<S> we have carried out high pressure experiment on the pressure - induced superconductor ceirsi@xmath0 without inversion center . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical resistivity and ac heat capacity were measured in the same run for the same sample . </S>",
    "<S> the critical pressure of the antiferromagnetic state was determined to be @xmath1 = 2.25 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity @xmath2 shows both antiferromagnetic and superconducting transitions at pressures close to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the co - existence of the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting region is extended up to about 3.5 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 shows a maximum value of 1.6 k around @xmath4 gpa . at 2.58 gpa , </S>",
    "<S> a large heat capacity anomaly was observed at @xmath3 = 1.59 k. the jump of the heat capacity in the form of @xmath5 is 5.7 @xmath6 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest value observed among all superconductors studied previously , suggesting the strong - coupling superconductivity in ceirsi@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the large magnitude and anisotropy of the upper critical field @xmath7 at 2.65 gpa is discussed from view points of the strong - coupling superconductivity and the reduced paramagnetic effect in the non - centrosymmetric superconductor . above @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , the electrical resistivity shows the anomalous @xmath8-linear dependence in the wide temperature region from @xmath3 to 30 k , which is different from the fermi liquid theory . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the heat capacity @xmath9 shows a simple temperature dependence in the normal state above @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these features do not seem to be explained simply by the spin fluctuation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic specific heat coefficient at @xmath3 is approximately unchanged as a function of pressure , even at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity in ceirsi@xmath0 may be different from those appeared around the magnetic instability . </S>"
