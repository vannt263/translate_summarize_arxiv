    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous cosmic explosions known , and their afterglows extend throughout the electromagnetic spectrum , from x - ray to radio wavelengths .",
    "spectra of grb afterglows in the ultraviolet ( uv ) to optical wavelength range are particularly important for the study of grbs , because the spectral positions of absorption lines from the surrounding environment provide the redshifts , and hence the distances and luminosities of grbs . under exceptionally favourable conditions , prompt , very near - uv grb spectra have been obtained from the ground ( i.e. _ vlt_-uves , which in principle is sensitive to wavelengths longward of 3000   , observed a grb in @xmath10 minutes ) . however , such observations are rare due to atmospheric limitations , time of occurrence , and the source position in the sky .",

    "two grisms are also included in the uvot filter wheel to enable spectra of grbs to be obtained .",
    "until recently they have not been used in the grb observing sequence because early in the mission the data indicated that most grb afterglows were too faint for grism observations , even at early times @xcite . however , after four years of _ swift _ observations , our grb sample is large enough that we can meaningfully reassess the frequency of grb afterglows which are bright enough for grism spectroscopy , and ascertain the optimum timing for their inclusion in the automated observing sequence .",
    "the catalog of grb afterglows observed with the uvot in the first two - and - a - half years @xcite shows that uvot observes @xmath12 each year , of which @xmath13 are detected by uvot in at least one exposure . in its first four years of operation , _ swift _ observed 5 grbs ( grb  050525a , grb  050922c , grb  061007 , grb  080319b and grb  080810 ) brighter than 14th magnitude in @xmath14 .",

    "the onboard software autonomously replaces the grism exposure with a @xmath2-filter exposure for bursts which are faint in the bat , and therefore unlikely to be viable grism targets .    in the following sections we present the first grism image of a grb taken with the uvot , the resulting spectrum of , and its corresponding analysis",

    "uvot started settled observations of  93 seconds after the trigger beginning with a 150 second @xmath11-filter finding chart , followed by a 50 second exposure starting 251 seconds after the trigger , a second finding chart in @xmath2 , and then exposures in the other uvot photometric filters @xcite .",
