    "multiparticle entangled states are indeed valuable resources , which not only can be employed to test quantum nonlocality against local hidden variable theory in fundamental physics @xcite , but also have practical applications in quantum information processing @xcite , such as quantum communication and computation .",
    "typical such entangled states are ghz states @xcite , w states @xcite and cluster states @xcite .",
    "it is known that entangled states become increasingly susceptible to environmental interactions if the number of particles increases .",
    "therefore , an important practical challenge is the design of robust and most importantly decoherence - resistant mechanisms for its generation .",
    "generating multiparticle entangled states has been proposed or even experimentally demonstrated in different physical systems , such as atomic ensembles in free space @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , cold atoms in optical lattice @xcite , and cavity qed @xcite . among various excellent systems ,",
    "cavity qed @xcite offers one of the most promising and qualified candidates for quantum state engineering and quantum information processing @xcite , particularly , for applications in quantum networking @xcite , quantum communication , and distributed quantum computation , since atoms trapped in optical cavities are the natural candidates for quantum nodes , and these nodes can be connected by quantum channels such as optical fibers @xcite .",
    "quantum information is generated , processed and stored locally in each node , which is connected by optical fibers , and is transferred between different nodes via photons through the fibers .",
    "recently , with the development of experimental realization of strong coupling between cold atoms and fiber - based cavity @xcite , the coupled cavity - fiber system has been extensively investigated @xcite . since entangled distant atomic clouds are the building blocks for quantum network and quantum communication , it is desirable to develop a one - step scheme for generating multiparticle entangled states between two cold atomic clouds in distant cavities coupled by an optical fiber .    in this work , we describe a method to construct multiparticle entangled states of the form @xmath1 $ ] or @xmath2 $ ] in a coupled cavity - fiber system , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 terms ) are product states describing @xmath5 atoms in the j__th _ _ cavity which are all in the ( same ) internal state @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "this method can be implemented in one step and in a deterministic fashion . through suitably choosing the intensities and detunings of the fields and precisely controlling the dynamics of the system",
    ", the target entangled states can be engineered , which are immune to the spontaneous emission of the atoms and losses of the fiber , and independent of the states of the cavities . as an application",
    ", we also discuss how to use the produced entangled atomic state @xmath8 to generate the so called noon state of the cavity modes @xcite , i.e. , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is fock state for the respective cavity mode .",
    "this state is important for quantum lithography and heisenberg - limited interferometry with photons .",
    "we should emphasize that the noon state , which is mode - entangled , is different from the multiparticle atomic entangled states proposed in this scheme .",
    "the generated noon state in itself is a two - mode entangled state , in which the entanglement is between two different cavity modes .",
    "however , the generated atomic entangled states are particle - entangled . the experimental feasibility and technical demands of this scheme",
    "are analyzed based on recent experimental advances in the strong coupling between cold @xmath0rb clouds and fiber - based cavity .",
    "implementing the proposal in experiment would be an important step toward quantum communication and networking with atomic clouds in distant cavities connected by optical fibers .",
    "consider two cold atomic clouds trapped in two distant optical cavities coupled by a short optical fiber  roughly a few hundred of them trapped in each cavity  such that the spatial extent of the cloud is much smaller than the wavelength of the light  lamb - dicke regime . in this case",
    "the couplings between the atoms and the light fields are nearly homogeneous , which no longer depend on the individual coordinates of the atoms but only on the collective pseudo - spin coordinate @xcite .",
    "however , more realistic considerations will be given in the final discussions on the feasibility of this scheme .",
    "for simplicity , the atomic number in each cloud is assumed to be @xmath5 , which however is not the necessary condition .",

    "each atom has the level structure of three - level @xmath11 configuration , with two ground states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and an upper state @xmath12 .",
    "the atoms are driving by four laser fields and dispersively coupling to the cavity mode , establishing two distinct raman transitions . the cavity mode",
    "( frequency @xmath13 ) and the driving field of frequency @xmath14 couple the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 via the upper state @xmath12 with the coupling constant @xmath15 and rabi frequency @xmath16 ( complex ) , which is assumed to have a small detuning @xmath17 from the two - photon raman resonance .",
    "the laser fields of frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath19 act on the transitions @xmath20 and @xmath21 with rabi frequencies @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( complex ) , which satisfy the usual raman resonance . to cancel the stark shift for level @xmath7 caused by the classical laser field ( frequency @xmath19 ) , the transition @xmath21 is also driven by a third classical laser field of frequency @xmath24 with rabi frequency @xmath25 ( complex ) .",
    "the corresponding detunings for the related transitions are @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the transition frequencies for the atoms . in the interaction picture ,",

    "we now consider the coupling of the cavity modes to the fiber modes .",
    "the number of longitudinal modes of the fiber that significantly interact with the corresponding cavity modes is on the order of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the length of the fiber and @xmath46 is the decay rate of the cavity fields into the continuum of the fiber modes . if we consider the short fiber limit @xmath47 , then only one resonant mode @xmath48 of the fiber interacts with the cavity modes @xcite",
    "therefore , in this case the interaction hamiltonian describing the coupling between the cavity modes and the fiber mode is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cavity - fiber coupling strength , and @xmath51 is the phase due to propagation of the field through the fiber .",
    "define three normal bosonic modes @xmath52 by the canonical transformations @xmath53 @xcite . in terms of the bosonic modes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath56 is diagonal .",
