    "<S> the lhcb has discovered two new states with preferred @xmath0 quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 from @xmath3 decays . </S>",
    "<S> these new states can be interpreted as hidden charm pentaquarks . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that the main features of these pentaquarks can be described by diquark model . </S>",
    "<S> the diquark model predicts that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in two separate octet multiplets of flavor @xmath4 and there is also an additional decuplet pentaquark multiplet . </S>",
    "<S> finding the states in these multiplets can provide crucial evidence for this model . </S>",
    "<S> the weak decays of b - baryon to a light meson and a pentaquark can have cabibbo allowed and suppressed decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the @xmath4 limit , for @xmath5-spin related decay modes the ratio of the decay rates of cabibbo suppressed to cabibbo allowed decay channels is given by @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> there are also other testable relations for b - baryon weak decays into a pentaquark and a light pseudoscalar . </S>",
    "<S> these relations can be used as tests for the diquark model for pentaquark .    * introduction </S>",
    "<S> *    the lhcb collaboration has recently discovered two new states@xcite which can be interpreted as two different pentaquarks @xmath7 from @xmath8 , followed by @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this has generated a lot of theoretical investigations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quark contents can be identified as @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> although the states contain charm quarks , they are hidden charm pentaquarks because @xmath11 and @xmath12 appear together and the net charm quantum number is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit quantum numbers @xmath0 and their masses are @xmath13 experimentally quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 for these two states are not ruled out .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these states @xmath14 and @xmath15 need to be further confirmed as there may be some other effects which can minic similar effects@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . if these states are genuine pentaquarks , one may ask whether they are molecular states of two hadrons or composite hadron systems@xcite , or a tightly bound five quark system @xmath16 $ ] , or the quarks bound in other forms@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is intriguing that the @xmath17 in the s - wave state has a mass very close to the @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> such a molecular state was actually studied just before the experimental discovery@xcite . with </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 and @xmath19 bound sates one can obtain both @xmath14 and @xmath15 states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these prompt the speculation that the pentaquarks might be molecular states . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it has been argued that the two pentaquarks from the lhcb are five quark systems organized in @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] diquarks@xcite , and the @xmath12 , the diquark model for pentaquark . </S>",
    "<S> the diquark model also has supports from tetraquark studies@xcite . at present , with limited data </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to distinguish whether the pentaquarks are molecular states or more tightly bound quark states or even mixture of these states . </S>",
    "<S> the diquark model has simple structure to analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we also find it very predictive . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in this work we choose to study some properties of diquark model for the pentaquarks discovered at the lhcb . + * diquark model for pentaquarks *    in the diquark model the two pentaquarks from the lhcb are five quark systems organized in @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] diquarks@xcite , and the @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> we indicate the pentaquarks with @xmath24 and @xmath25 by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . assuming that the two pentaquarks have @xmath32 and @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , these two fields are component fields in octet multiplets with the following spin diquark combinations fit the picture well@xcite @xmath34_{\\beta,\\;s=1 } [ q'q'']_{\\gamma,\\;s=1 } , l=0\\}\\,\\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\cal p}_a(5/2^+ ) = \\epsilon^{\\alpha \\beta\\gamma}\\{\\bar c_\\alpha [ cq]_{\\beta,\\;s=1 } [ q'q'']_{\\gamma,\\;s=0 } , l=1\\}\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we denote the octet pentaquark component fields as @xmath35    for @xmath32 , there should also be a decuplet @xmath36 ( totally symmetric in sub - indices ) multiplet . </S>",

    "<S> it is clear that there are other members of pentaquarks . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the decay channels @xmath40 , the pentaquarks in the octet and decuplet will be able to decay into a @xmath41 plus baryons in the low - lying octet and decuplet , respectively . for @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> , there should be a companion singlet pentaquark @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no low - lying baryon singlet , @xmath44 will not be able to decay into a @xmath41 plus an ordinary low - lying baryon , but may be an ordinary baryon and multi - mesons forming a @xmath4 singlet . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the pentaquarks are degenerate in the @xmath4 limit . but may be different due to s - quark mass being much larger than u- and d - quarks . </S>",
    "<S> estimate of mass differences for some of the pentaquarks in the diquark model has been carried out in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> discoverying these additional pentaquarks identified above is one of the way to verify the diquark model for pentaquark which can in principle be carried at the lhcb . </S>",
    "<S> + * pentaquark weak decays *    we now discuss weak decay modes of b - baryon into an octet or a decuplet pentaquark and a light pseudoscalar octet meson . </S>",
    "<S> the leading effective hamiltonian inducing @xmath45 decays in the sm has both parity conserving and violating parts given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 can be @xmath48 or @xmath23 . </S>",

    "<S> the coefficients @xmath50 are the wilson coefficients ( wc ) which wc have been studied by several groups and can be found in ref .  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the low - lying @xmath62 @xmath63 b - baryons are made up of a @xmath64 quark and two light quarks . here </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath64 quark is a singlet and the light quark @xmath47 is a member in the fundamental representation @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the b - baryons then have representations under flavor @xmath4 as @xmath66 , that is , the b - baryons contain an anti - triplet and a sextet in the @xmath4 flavor space@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the anti - triplet @xmath63 and the sextet @xmath67 b - baryons will be indicated by @xmath68    the pseudoscalar octet mesons will be indicated by @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> they are @xmath70    at the hadron level , the decay amplitude can be generically written as @xmath71    to obtain the @xmath4 invariant decay amplitude for a b - baryon , one first uses the hamiltonian to annihilate the b - quark in @xmath72 ( or @xmath67 ) and then contract @xmath4 indices in an appropriate way with final states @xmath73 and @xmath69 . taking the anti - triplet tree amplitude @xmath74 and sextet tree amplitude @xmath75 as examples , following the procedures for b - baryon charmless </S>",
    "<S> two - body decays in ref.@xcite , we have    @xmath76    and @xmath77    the @xmath4 invariant decay amplitude involve decuplet pentaquarks can be written as @xmath78    for @xmath72 baryons decay into @xmath73 , there are six possible terms as far as @xmath4 properties are concerned . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contributions are from terms with coefficients @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in figure 1 , we show diagrams correspond to these terms . in these figures , the quarks @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are contracted by the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath86 or @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this property plays an important role in determining whether @xmath24 or sextet diquarks are allowed to form . </S>",
    "<S> the two terms with coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 are allowed , but it turns out that for these two terms the @xmath73 state is actually a higher order fork state with the same @xmath4 quantum numbers but with more quark contents as can be seen in figure 2 . therefore , one expects that the coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 to be smaller than @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> we will include all in our later discussions . </S>",
    "<S> for the properties we emphasis will not be affected whether to include @xmath88 and @xmath89 or not .    for @xmath67 baryons decay into @xmath73 , only three possible terms , terms with coefficients , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding diagrams are shown in figure 1.b , 1.c , and 1.d . because the two light quarks in @xmath93 are symmetric </S>",
    "<S> , similar terms to those with coefficients @xmath94 , @xmath89 , @xmath95 for @xmath63 decays are identically zero .    for @xmath63 and @xmath93 baryons decay into decuplet , the final light quarks need to be in totally symmetric state . </S>",
    "<S> there are less possibilities . in figure 3 </S>",
    "<S> we show the corresponding diagrams for the allowed terms .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : b22s1 ] </S>"
