    "in recent years the quark - hadron ( qh ) duality has been a subject of many experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the idea of duality comes from bloom and gilman @xcite .",
    "it was based on the comparison of @xmath2 @xmath3 resonance structure functions at small values of @xmath4 with their dis counterparts at large @xmath4 .",
    "bloom and gilman observed that in plots in the variable @xmath5 resonance peaks are approximately averaged by the dis structure function .",
    "more recent experimental data on duality were reported in @xcite where several plots of @xmath3 for @xmath4 in the range from 0.3 to @xmath6 as functions of the nachtmann variable @xmath7 were presented on the same figure .",
    "the resonance peaks for @xmath8 are seen to be averaged by the dis structure function calculated at @xmath9 .",
    "the qh duality can be analyzed in quantitative way by calculating the ratios of integrated strengths over a range in @xmath7 covering a chosen set of resonances and the dis structure function .",
    "the agreement is on the level of 10% .    in the theoretical analysis of the duality @xcite",
    "one introduces a language of twist expansion of moments of structure functions in powers of @xmath10 .",
    "the duality then means the suppression of higher twists @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation how the coherent amplitude in the resonance region can be equal to incoherent sum of amplitudes from the quark constituents of nucleon is proposed in @xcite in terms of su(6 ) symmetry by means of cancellation of contributions of positive and negative parity .",
    "the knowledge of relative strengths of electromagnetic and neutrino induced @xmath11 transitions leads to theoretical predictions concerning the domain in @xmath12 in which the duality should hold .",
    "the consequences of su(6 ) breakdown for ratios of unpolarized and polarized structure functions are also investigated in @xcite .",
    "the qh duality is usually discussed theoretically and analyzed experimentally in the context of en interactions .",
    "but the subject is relevant also for neutrino physics . here",
    "the exact data is missing and arguments based on duality can be used to provide better estimates of @xmath13n structure functions and cross sections in the few gev neutrino energy region where they are known with insufficient accuracy @xcite . for these energies",
    "it is necessary to consider both quasi - elastic and inelastic channels .",
    "single pion production ( spp ) channels are typically treated separately from more inelastic ones which are accounted for by extrapolating dis formalism as much as necessary .",
    "this approach carries a lot of uncertainty and requires a better theoretical understanding in the whole kinematical region .",
    "such understanding and control over the numerical procedures can follow from the qh duality analysis .    when trying to discuss the qh duality in the neutrino interactions the main obstacle is a lack of precise experimental results .",
    "the existing spp data is poor in precision and statistics @xcite . in the future",
    "the data will hopefully become precise enough to impose more rigid constraints on theoretical models @xcite but for a moment the natural strategy is to analyze in detail a generally accepted model . from the point of view of monte carlo application",
    "this is the rein - sehgal ( rs ) @xcite model .",
    "the rs model was developed to describe spp induced by lepton - nucleon nc and cc interactions .",
    "it is currently used in almost all neutrino monte carlo generators of events @xcite .",
    "it is based on the quark model computations of the hadronic current as proposed and developed by feynman , kislinger and ravndal @xcite . in the original model",
    "the contributions from 18 resonances with masses smaller than 2  gev are added in the coherent way .",
    "the scattering amplitudes contain several form factors .",
    "the vector form factors are obtained from the electro - production data by means of standard cvc argument .",
    "axial form factors are less constrained by theoretical arguments ( pcac ) and the available data .",
    "the rs model contains also an _ ad hoc _ prescription for computing the non - resonant background .",
    "the extra amplitude is introduced with the quantum numbers of the @xmath14 resonance but without the breit - wigner term and then added in the incoherent way . its strength is fine tuned in order to obtain an agreement with the experimental spp data .",
    "the rs model can be supplemented by @xmath15 containing terms @xcite ( @xmath16 is the charged lepton mass ) absent in the original paper .",
    "the discussion of the qh duality for neutrino scattering based on the rs model is in a very important point different from the electron scattering analysis based on the experimental data .",
    "the aim of the rs model is to describe spp channels only . in the electron scattering studies the experimental data is that of the inclusive cross section . in order to perform the analogous analysis for the rs model",
    "it is necessary to extract and add contributions from more inelastic channels in the kinematical region of invariant hadronic mass up to @xmath17 .",
    "our analysis is based on two basic assumptions .",
    "the first is that the rs model predictions for spp cross sections are fairly close to what will come out from future precise cross section measurements .",
    "the second is that we know the probability that at a given point in the kinematically allowed region the final state is that of spp . throughout this paper",
    "we will call the probabilities _",
    "1-pion functions_. we obtained these functions numerically @xcite using the lund algorithm @xcite .",
    "the functions ( one for each exclusive spp channel ) were discussed also in @xcite and they turn out to depend only on the invariant hadronic mass . for the value of invariant mass",
    "@xmath18 the contribution from more inelastic channels amounts to about 50% .",
    "using these functions one can rescale spp contributions to the structure functions and evaluate the overall structure functions in the region @xmath19 gev . in section [ single pion production and dis ]",
    "we discuss the precision with which the 1-pion functions are reconstructed .",
    "we present the experimental data for the proton photoproduction 1-pion function @xcite .",
    "we present also an alternative approach to calculate the 1-pion function for available hadron multiplicity data and kno model @xcite .",
    "the aim of our paper is to investigate the question if the duality holds also in @xmath13n reactions .",
    "our methodology is to repeat the analysis done for en scattering .",
    "we calculate structure functions as they are defined by the rs model and compare with the dis structure functions based on grv94 pdfs and evaluated at @xmath20  @xmath21 .",
    "we perform also a quantitative comparison of integrated strengths over resonances .",
    "all the comparisons are done first for proton and neutron structure function and then for their average i.e. for isoscalar ( deuterium - like ) target .",
    "both charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) reactions are discussed .",
    "it is well known that cc spp channels on proton and neutron have distinct properties .",
    "the strength od @xmath22 resonance for proton reaction is three times as big as its neutron reaction counterpart due to isospin rules . in the neutrino - proton reaction",
    "there is no need to introduce non - resonant background which gives significant contribution to the neutrino - neutron spp channels .",
    "the way in which non - resonant background is treated in the rs model in not completely satisfactory .",
    "for this reason we address the idea of two - component duality proposed by harari and freund @xcite .",
    "they suggested that resonance and non - resonance contributions to the low energy @xmath23n scattering amplitude ( s - channel ) correspond to contributions given by the high energy amplitudes ( t - channel ) due to reggeon and pomeron exchange respectively . using the modern language",
    "it can be expressed as existence of a relation between resonance / valence quark and non - resonant / sea quark contributions to the structure functions .",
    "a confirmation of this idea in en interactions was found in @xcite : the @xmath3 structure function averaged over resonances at low values of the nachtmann variable ( @xmath24 ) behaves in the way which strongly resembles the behavior of valence quark contribution to dis scaling curve .",
    "there is also a striking similarity between the above mentioned averaged @xmath3 rescaled by a factor of @xmath25 and the @xmath26 @xmath13n data .",
    "if resonance contribution to structure function is dual to the valence dis contribution and if the overall duality is satisfied then also non - resonant background should be dual to the sea quark contribution .",
    "the last duality could be then used to provide a model for non - resonant background .",
    "the question of the qh duality in @xmath13n interactions was discussed already by matsui , sato and lee @xcite and by lalakulich , paschos and piranishvili @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the lee - sato model @xcite for @xmath22 production in en and @xmath13n scattering was analyzed .",
    "it was shown that in the vicinity of @xmath22 excitation peak the local duality holds for both proton and iso - scalar structure functions in cc and nc neutrino reactions .",
    "the resonance model investigated in @xcite includes four resonances @xmath27 , @xmath14 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 of @xmath30 gev .",
    "the model ( unlike the rs model ) contains correction for the non - zero charged lepton mass .",
    "the conclusions are in agreement with those contained in @xcite .",
    "some qualitative elements of the present analysis of the rs model can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "several theoretical and practical issues related to the problem of how to combine smoothly the rs and dis contributions in monte carlo generators are addressed .",
    "using the idea of duality one can combine experimental and theoretical arguments and find suitable modification of the structure functions which average over resonances for small values of @xmath4 .",
    "one expects that duality should hold for @xmath31 gev@xmath1 @xcite . for @xmath4 approaching zero @xmath3 structure function for electro - production should behave like @xmath32 due to gauge invariance .",
    "the presence of axial current modifies this behavior .",
    "an important piece of information is provided by the adler sum rule @xcite .",
    "it is argued that vector and axial parts of the structure functions should be modified in a different way @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the necessary theoretical introduction is given .",
    "the recipe to obtain structure functions from the rein - sehgal model is presented and the 1-pion functions are introduced .",
    "the functions @xmath33 which measure how well the duality holds are also defined and ambiguities in their definition are discussed . in section 3",
    "we present the results of the numerical analysis and their discussion .",
