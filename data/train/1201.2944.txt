    "the detection and frequency of dual active galactic nuclei ( agn ) on kpc scales is an important test of the merger - driven agn model .",
    "understanding the types of galaxies and specific merger stages where dual agn occur provides important clues about the peak black hole growth during the merging process . over the last decade",
    ", several nearby dual agn on kpc scales have been found serendipitously in interacting galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , higher redshift dual agn systems have been discovered using high resolution integral field spectroscopy or radio observations @xcite .",
    "finding these duals is an important step , but a systematic study of dual agn offers the best chance of understanding their frequency and the types of galaxies and interactions involved in their triggering .",
    "early studies of the dual agn frequency at higher redshift ( z@xmath40.15 ) focused on quasar pairs but suffered from severe observational difficulties detecting close pairs .",
    "@xcite found a 2x quasar overabundance on @xmath0100 kpc scales based on normal galaxy clustering .",
    "other early observations found a small fraction ( 0.1% ) of quasar pairs with typical separations of 50 to 100 kpc suggesting that at least one agn shuts off on scales @xmath030 kpc @xcite .",
    "recent studies using the sdss suggested dual quasars peak at small @xmath050 kpc scales with a small excess extending to 100s of kpc @xcite .",
    "other recent studies found the opposite result with only a small excess at @xmath0@xmath5 kpc @xcite .",
    "however , on close scales @xmath030 kpc , these observations are complicated by gravitational lenses @xcite as well as an inability to easily resolve each agn in optical and x - ray observations .",
    "nearby galaxies are better suited for dual agn studies since both the nuclear engine and the host galaxies can be resolved and studied down to separations of a few kpc . a large study of optical agn pairs at z@xmath00.16 using sdss spectroscopy found that their fraction was @xmath61.5% within 30 kpc @xcite while their cumulative fraction increases linearly with separation . however , because of fiber collision limits this technique suffers from incompleteness at close scales .",
    "furthermore , optical surveys are incomplete since x - ray and ir selected agn are not always detected optically @xcite .",
    "therefore , a study of nearby agn using emission line diagnostics and x - ray observations provides the best chance of accurately measuring the dual agn frequency .    in this letter",
    ", we determine the incidence of dual agn in the local universe by searching for multiple active nuclei from the @xcite sample of ultra hard x - ray selected agn .",
    "this sample is ideal since archival x - ray data from @xmath7 xrt , @xmath8 , or @xmath2 exist for the entire set of objects .",
    "the ultra hard x - rays also offer a reliable tracer of the bolometric luminosity of agn since it is nearly unaffected by host galaxy contamination or obscuration , which strongly affects other selection techniques such as optical emission lines , infrared spectral analysis , or optical colors .",

    "we studied the galaxy morphologies and merger types of systems hosting dual agn .",
    "we limited this study to projected separations @xmath030 kpc because of the low frequency of duals found at larger separations and the higher chance of projection effects causing the galaxies to appear to be at artificially small separations .",
    "we find that the frequency of dual agn is strongly dependent on galaxy mass ratio ( figure [ dualfrac ] ) suggesting a minor merger is insufficient to trigger dual agn . the mean stellar mass ratio and 1@xmath38 are 2.1@xmath391.3 .",

    "we find that the x - ray luminosity of both agn increases with decreasing separation , suggesting that the merging event is key to powering both agn ( figure [ dualxray ] ) .",
    "for example , the six most luminous companion agn are found at small separations ( @xmath015 kpc ) . a spearman correlation test indicates a @xmath499.998% probability that the @xmath31 of the agn companion and separation are inversely correlated .",
    "similarly , a spearman test indicates a @xmath490% that the primary agn 2 - 10 kev luminosity and separation are inversely correlated .",

    "dual agn are much more likely to occur in systems with a close companion within @xmath030 kpc among bat agn and sdss seyferts . among bat agn with a companion at small separations ( @xmath015 kpc ) , a high fraction ( 50% , 8/16 )",

    "( 3/16 ) of the dual agn in the bat sample , x - ray spectroscopy reveals the presence of a dual agn that is not detected with emission line diagnostics ( ngc 6240 , mrk 739 , ngc 833 ) .",
    "3 .   the hard x - ray luminosities of both agn increase as the separation between the galaxies decrease suggesting that the merging event is key in powering the agn .",
    "additionally , close dual agn ( @xmath030 kpc ) tend to be more common among the most x - ray luminous systems with @xmath47@xmath410@xmath48 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "this is in agreement with recent simulations suggesting the peak accretion and bh luminosity appear at small scales while relatively lower luminosity dual agn are found at wider separations ( van wassenhove et al .",
    "dual agn are more prominent among major mergers ( @xmath37@xmath03 ) and avoid absorption line galaxies with elliptical morphologies . however , agn activity is more difficult to detect in dwarf companions because of the likely lower mass bhs .",
    "we find sdss seyferts are much less likely than bat agn ( 0.25% vs.  7.8% ) to be found in dual agn at scales @xmath030 kpc .",
    "these results suggest that in systems already hosting a single agn , nuclear activity in companions is triggered in the majority of close - separation major mergers . _ indeed , our sample finds that all 11 bat agn with non - absorption line companions in major mergers ( @xmath37@xmath03 ) and close separations ( @xmath030  kpc ) are dual agn_. our sample also suggests that early - type gas - poor ( red / elliptical ) companions are unlikely to host agn , possibly because it may not be able to capture enough gas during the merging process . from these results",
    ", one might expect a high dual agn fraction in luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) which are associated with gas - rich mergers .",
    "however , only a few dual agn in this sample are lirgs ( e.g. , ngc 6420 , mrk 463 ) which is consistent with the overall fraction of lirgs in the rest of the bat sample ( 18% , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it seems that the particular type of merger triggering the luminous bat agn also triggers the secondary agn .",
    "dual agn systems are more common in ultra hard x - ray selected agn than sdss seyferts since they have more close companions @xcite .",
    "since there are more dual agn among bat agn than sdss seyferts by more than a factor of 10 , the much higher fraction is most likely mainly because of the higher agn luminosities of bat agn , not the lack of x - ray observations of sdss seyferts .",
    "we also find a higher total fraction of dual agn compared to dual agn studies using the double peaked method @xcite . at scales @xmath015 kpc , we find 5% ( 8/167 ) are dual agn , @xmath610x higher than that estimated from double peak sources ( 0.3 - 0.5% , at @xmath52 , rosario et al .",
    "2011 , @xmath53 , at @xmath54 , fu et al .",
    "this is likely because : 1 ) double peak sources are at higher redshifts , @xmath610 times that of this sample ( z=0.02 vs.  z=0.3 ) so they are more difficult to detect as dual agn , 2 ) the sdss fiber is 3@xmath22 , so it is sensitive to different , typically smaller physical scales ( at @xmath55 , 3@xmath22@xmath615 kpc ) , 3 ) the double peak method is biased towards selecting certain types of single agn such as radio bright agn @xcite , which is different than bat agn where only 0.5% are radio loud @xcite , 4 ) the double peak method has difficulty detecting dual agn with small velocity offsets , weak lines , or those dual agn that are detected only in the x - rays like ngc 6240 . finally ,",
    "because of the fixed sdss fiber size , the double peak method is sensitive to agn with different physical separations and different luminosities depending on the redshift range studied making a comparison difficult , but our results suggest that the fraction of dual agn is much higher than the double peak method suggests among luminous agn .",
    "this type of extensive study is impossible to do at higher redshifts because of surface brightness dimming and the limitations in resolution and exposure time , particularly in x - rays since the secondary agn are typically 10 - 100x fainter .",
    "however , the pair fraction and frequency of gas - rich `` wet '' galaxy mergers increases with redshift .",
    "this suggests that dual agn activation may be much more common at higher redshifts .",
