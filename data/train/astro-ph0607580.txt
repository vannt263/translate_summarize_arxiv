    "there is almost irrefutible evidence for an increase in the star formation density with redshift , as demonstrated by emission line and continuum star formations tracers in wavebands from the ultraviolet to the submillimeter and radio wavebands .",
    "this evolution appears to be stronger for tracers which are less sensitive to dust obscuration ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that an increasing proportion of the activity in more distant galaxies may be highly obscured ( e.g.  blain et al .  1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "indeed , recent results on the mid- to far - infrared emission of luminous but dust obscured galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath103 ) suggests that the origin of their large infrared luminosities is a mix of dust obscured vigorous star formation and/or dust enshrouded active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ( yan et al .",
    "2005 ; houck et al .  2005 ; lutz et al .  2005 ; desai et al.2006 ) .",
    "in many sources it is likely that both agn and star formation contribute to the emission as a result of the close link required between the growth of super - massive black holes and bulges in massive galaxies ( e.g.  borys et al.2005 ) .",
    "one of the best - studied populations of high - redshift , far - infrared luminous galaxies is that identified in the submillimeter waveband using the scuba camera ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "although they span less than an order of magnitude in submillimeter flux , these galaxies are responsible for much of the energy density in the submillimeter background ( barger et al .  1998 ;",
    "hughes et al .  1998 ; smail et al .  2002 ; cowie , barger & kneib 2002 ; scott et al .",
    "the faintness of these obscured galaxies in the optical waveband has made it difficult to obtain precise redshifts ( e.g.  simpson et al .",
    "2004 ) , although some progress has been made using ultraviolet / blue spectrographs ( chapman et al .  2003a ; 2005 ) .",
    "the median redshift for submillimeter galaxies with 850@xmath11 m fluxes of @xmath12mjy , ( hereafter smgs ) is @xmath13 ( chapman et al .  2003a , 2005 ) .",
    "the submillimeter and radio fluxes of these systems indicate their bolometric luminosities are @xmath14l@xmath15 ( kovacs et al .",
    "2006 ) , confirming that they are examples of high - redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "this population provides critical constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , if the bolometric emission from smgs is powered solely by star formation , then these galaxies form about half of the stars seen in the local universe ( lilly et al.1999 ) .",
    "however , it appears likely that both agn and star formation activity contribute to the immense far - infrared luminosities of these systems , although it has been difficult to disentangle the precise balance between these two energy sources .",
    "recent sensitive x - ray analysis suggest that star formation is likely to be the dominant source of the bolometric luminosity in smgs ( alexander et al.2005a , b ) .",
    "further evidence suggest it is plausible to identify smgs as the progenitor of massive elliptical galaxies at the present - day , based on their large gas , stellar and dynamical masses ( neri et al .",

    "2004 , 2006 ) . furthermore",
    ", combining the x - ray constraints on the agn within this population with the typical mass estimates suggests that smgs are the sites of coeval growth of stellar bulges and central black holes ( borys et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "rest - frame optical emission lines provide a powerful tool to investigate many fundamental properties of galaxies , such as star formation rates ( sfrs ) , power sources , internal extinction and metallicity .",
    "swinbank et al .",
    "( 2004 ) conducted a systematic near - infrared spectroscopic survey of thirty smgs to investigate their sfrs and metallicities and the kinematics of the emission line gas .",
    "however , the wavelength coverage was limited to the region around h@xmath3 and so they did not include several emission lines at shorter wavelengths , such as h@xmath0  and [ oiii]@xmath1 , which are useful for evaluating internal extinction and metallicity or determining the power source .",
    "we present in this paper the results from a near - infrared spectroscopic survey of redshifted [ oiii]@xmath1 , h@xmath0  and [ oii]@xmath2  lines for a sample of far - infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "the sample is composed of smgs and optically faint radio galaxies ( ofrgs ) , at @xmath103.5 .",
    "chapman et al .  ( 2004 ) and blain et al .  ( 2004 ) claim that high - redshift ofrgs are ulirgs , with similar bolometric luminosities to smgs but warmer characteristic dust temperature , resulting in them being undetectable in the submillimeter waveband .",
    "we use h@xmath3/h@xmath0  emission line ratios to derive the dust extinction in these systems and then employ these estimates to derive extinction - corrected sfrs from the h@xmath3luminosities .",

    "it is clear that the majority , 8/13 , of sources in our sample ( including all but one , smmj163639.01 + 405635.9 , with all four emission lines detected ) are classified as agn based on these criteria .",
    "we reiterate that this subsample may be biased towards strong line emitters ( due to the requirement to have detected lines in our low - resolution spectra ) and so this is perhaps not a surprising result .",
    "moreover , we must interpret the bpt diagram with caution since `` superwind '' ejecta ( shock - driven line emitting gas ) can occupy a very similar region to agn ( dopita & sutherland 1995 ) . to illustrate this possibility in more detail , we plot the emission line ratio of the wind structure in m82 from a @xmath109kpc region ( shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) and in a @xmath110kpc@xmath111 area of ngc6240 ( schmitt et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the former is indicative of a wind which is dominated by photoionization , and the latter illustrates the line ratios expected from shocks in a very dense environment .",
    "some smgs show very similar emission line ratios to ngc6240 , although most of them have lower [ nii]/h@xmath3  and higher [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratios .",
    "further support for the wind scenario is that p - cygni features are seen in the rest - uv emission lines ( chapman et al .  2003a , 2005 ) of a significant fraction of the smg population , supporting the presence of `` winds '' arising from the vigorous starburst activity .",
    "indeed , the majority ( 6/8 ) of this subsample ( with four detected emission lines ) are classified as `` sb '' or `` int '' from their rest uv spectroscopic features ( chapman et al .  2005 ; table  2 ) .",
    "the power sources in smgs is discussed further in  4.2 .",
    "looking at the individual sources in figure  4 , we note that smmj123622.65 + 621629.7 has a very low [ nii]/h@xmath3(@xmath112 ) emission line ratio and no detection of [ oiii]@xmath1  and h@xmath0(see also figure  5 in smail et al .",
    "2004 ) with h@xmath3/h@xmath0@xmath1134.25 and [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath3@xmath114 .",
    "this sources is an interacting system of a relatively blue(@xmath115 ) galaxy with extremely red ( @xmath116 ) companion , where the latter is a hard x - ray source .",
    "whilst the slit was aligned along the major axis of the red x - ray source , it is possible that it also passed through the blue component and the line emission may be contaminated . to avoid biasing our sample ,",
    "we have therefore eliminated this source from our subsequent analysis and discussion .",
    "smgs are dusty systems with large dust masses , @xmath117m@xmath15 , and high bolometric luminosities ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the presence of large quantities of dust and its associated reddening may also explain the large discrepancies between the sfrs derived for smgs from their far - infrared and h@xmath3luminosities ( swinbank et al .",
    "2004 ) , which imply extinction in h@xmath3  of factors @xmath119100 .",
    "there are of course alternative explanations : that the bulk of the far - infrared emission originates from other sources which are too dusty to see even at restframe optical wavelengths , such as very highly obscured agn , or due to emission which falls outside of the slits used in the h@xmath3  measurements .",
    "although , the latter explanation is unlikely as these observations are based on radio - identified sources with precise positions ( @xmath120 ; chapman et al .",
    "2005 ) , and so it is unlikely that a major source of bolometric emission has been missed by the observations .    to investigate the internal reddening of smgs ( at least for those regions which are visible in the restframe optical ) we plot the h@xmath3/h@xmath0  ratios as a function of their far - infrared luminosities in figure  5",
    "to calculate @xmath121 , we use the reddening curve from calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and assume an intrinsic h@xmath3/h@xmath0   ratio of 3.0 , which is between the values for typical seyfert 2 galaxies and/or liners ( 3.1 , halpern & steiner 1983 ; gaskel & ferland 1984 ) and star - forming galaxies , 2.85 ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) . the observed h@xmath3/h@xmath0  ratio for the smgs is typically 520 and the derived extinction spans @xmath1224 with a median value of @xmath123 ( where the error comes from bootstrap resampling ) .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the results based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of optical to near - infrared photometric data ( smail et al .",
    "2004 ) , and slightly higher than that derived from optical to mid - infrared seds ( @xmath124 , borys et al.2005 ) where the latter did not include any contribution from thermally pulsed - agb stars in the model seds , which might lead to an underestimation of the reddening ( maraston 206 ) .    in figure  6",
    "we compare the extinction corrected sfrs derived from the h@xmath3  and far - infrared luminosities .",
    "the far - infrared luminosities come from chapman et al .",
    "( 2003b ; 2004 ) based on sed model fitting to the observed 850@xmath11 m and 1.4-ghz fluxes at their known redshifts , assuming the local far - infrared - radio correlation holds ( condon et al .  1991 ; garrett 2002 ) .",
    "we also include observations for local _ iras _ galaxies ( kewley et al .",
    "2002 ) and _ iso _ galaxies ( flores et al .",
    "the typical @xmath121 in these samples are @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "the extinction corrected h@xmath3   luminosities for the _ iras _ and the _ iso _ galaxies are all calibrated in the same manner as for our smg samples based on their h@xmath3/h@xmath0  ratio .",
    "the sfrs from the h@xmath3  and from the far - infrared luminosities are derived using the equations given in kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "the correlation between the far - infrared and reddening - corrected h@xmath3  luminosities ( figure  6 ) appears to be relatively good with a linear relation extending over five orders of magnitude in sfr , although with some scatter , with the most luminous smgs in our sample having sfrs approximately an order of magnitude higher than those of the brightest _ iso _ galaxies . the good agreement between the two sfrs when using the reddening - corrected h@xmath3-estimate confirms that the discrepancies between the sfrs seen in swinbank et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are in large part due to dust extinction and moreover that the bulk of the far - infrared luminosity in these galaxies is probably derived from star formation .",
    "we note that it is likely that slit - losses and placement contribute to the scatter in these measurements as we are combining observations of h@xmath0  and h@xmath3  from different telescopes and instruments .",
    "for example , our brightest far - infrared source , smmj163650.43 + 405734.5 ( n2850.4 ) , has a lower sfr measured from h@xmath3  than from the far - infrared .",
    "however , this galaxy is spatially extended and has a very complex structure in the restframe optical ( smail et al .  2003 ; swinbank et al .",
    "it is therefore likely that our slit covered only a part of the h@xmath3  emitting region .",
    "finally , any remaining systematic offset between the two sfr estimates may be caused by the fact that our a@xmath127 estimates only reflect the reddening to the optically detectable gas and thus are not necessarily a good indicator of the total column towards the bolometric sources in these objects .",
    "smgs are proposed to be the progenitors of present - day massive spheroidal galaxies , because of their high star - formation rates and their large stellar , gas and dynamical masses ( smail et al .",
    "2004 ; neri et al .",
    "2003 ; greve et al .  2005 ; borys et al .  2005",
    "; tacconi et al .  2006 ; swinbank et al .",
    "most massive galaxies in the local universe contain super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; heckman et al.2004 ) .",
    "equally an agn appears to be almost universally present in smgs : based on the extremely sensitive x - ray observations of the _ chandra _ deep field north ( cdfn ) , alexander et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2005a , b ) found more than @xmath128% of smgs to be detected in hard x - rays , indicating they contain an accreting smbh .",
    "it is therefore interesting to estimate the mass of , and accretion rates onto , the central black holes of smgs to constrain the coevolution of the smbhs and the stellar masses of their surrounding bulge ( kawakatu et al .",
    "2003 ; granato et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the three sources classified as `` qso '' in our sample have characteristics typical of local nls1 : low [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratios ( @xmath1291.8 ) , and detectable feii emission in their individual and also composite spectra ( figures  1 & 3 ) .",
    "nls1 are commonly interpreted as hosting rapidly growing smbhs ( collin & kawaguti 2004 ) , and hence the spectral similarities of these smg - qsos with local nls1s could imply comparable physical conditions in the accretion disk around the smbh in the smgs .",
    "however , the smgs have fwhm@xmath1302500kmsec@xmath17for their balmer emission lines , and so they are not formally nls1s because these lines width are higher than the definition used for nls1 ( fwhm@xmath88 of h@xmath0  of @xmath131kmsec@xmath17 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is however worth noting that their h@xmath0  fwhm@xmath88 are close to the minimum for qsos at @xmath1322.1 ( jarvis & mclure 2006 ) , and narrower than the average of radio quiet / loud qsos(@xmath1336500kmsec@xmath17 ) .",
    "although , we caution that with the limited signal to noise in our spectra we may underestimate the line widths , missing weak and broader line components . for instance , in the composite spectrum of smg - qsos we estimate the fwhm@xmath88 of the h@xmath0  line as @xmath134kmsec@xmath17   using a single gaussian fit .",
    "this is 5001000kmsec@xmath17  broader than the mean of the individual spectra , suggesting there may be an undetected broad component present in them .",
    "more secure estimates of the line widths would either need observations of stronger emission lines such as h@xmath3 which are not available for these sources , or much deeper observations .",
    "the fwhm@xmath88 of the balmer emission lines in those smgs with agn - like features ( but omitting the three sources classified as `` qso '' ) , are 10003000 kmsec@xmath17 .",
    "they are at least 10002000 kmsec@xmath17  lower than the average fwhm of qsos at @xmath1322.1 measured from h@xmath0  and/or mgii lines ( jarvis & mclure 2006 ) suggesting that the smgs host lower mass smbhs .",
    "this would support the claims of alexander et al,(2005a , b ; see also borys et al .",
    "2005 ) based on eddington - limited assumptions .",
    "the similarities of the rest - frame optical spectral features of some smgs to nls1s implies rapid growth of the smbh in smg s nuclei .",
    "a total of 5/9 of the smgs classified as `` agn '' in our sample have relatively narrow fwhm@xmath66 ( up to @xmath1353700kmsec@xmath17 ) for their h@xmath3  or h@xmath0  emission lines , and 3/5 show marginal feii emission .",
    "therefore , the eddington - limited accretion determined for local nls1 galaxies may also be appropriate for smgs . assuming this , the measured line - widths are then consistent with the estimate of the central bh masses derived from their x - ray luminosities under the assumption of eddington - limited accretion ( @xmath136 , alexander et al .",
    "2005a ) . however , this conclusion appears to be undermined by the fact that three of these nls1-like smgs display high ( @xmath137 ) [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0   ratios which far exceed the nls1 definition of [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  @xmath138 , and thus these comparisons may not be appropriate .      to further test the claim that smgs have small smbh masses we compare the [ oiii]@xmath7  and hard x - ray luminosities .",

    "we adopt the hard x - ray fluxes from these observations , although 9/22 of them yield only the upper limits . for comparison",

    "all of these comparison samples are the _ observed _ luminosities : there are no extinction corrections applied to either the x - ray or [ oiii]@xmath7  measurements .",
    "figure  7 also shows the relation for seyfert 2 galaxies suggested by mulchaey et al .",
    "compared to the qsos and seyfert 1 galaxies , which are selected to represent unabsorbed hard x - ray sources , the majority of our smgs are typically an order of magnitude brighter in [ oiii]@xmath7  for a given hard x - ray luminosity .",
    "we note that a similar excess of [ oiii]@xmath7  emission is also seen in local ulirgs .",
    "could this apparent excess be due to absorption / extinction ?",
    "the typical hydrogen column densities to the agn in smgs have been determined by alexander et al .",

    "the [ oiii]@xmath7   excess can not be explained by a simple reddening effect .",
    "we also caution that the reddening corrections applied to the [ oiii]@xmath7  fluxes are uncertain since [ oiii]@xmath7  may arise in external shocks which suffer much less extinction than the h@xmath3/h@xmath0 ratio suggests .",
    "we also note that the apparent [ oiii]@xmath7  excess could arise simply due to the relatively shallow x - ray coverage in several of our fields where the sources only have upper - limits on their hard x - ray fluxes .",
    "however the fact that 3/4 sources with [ oiii]@xmath7  and hard x - ray detections from the cdfn , which has by - far the best x - ray data , show the excess provides good evidence for the reality of this feature .",
    "while some of the [ oiii]@xmath7  flux we see arises from the obscured agn , we suggest that the excess [ oiii]@xmath7  flux arises , at least in part , from shock - induced ( `` superwind '' ) activity .",
    "there are some cases of plausible `` superwind '' driven [ oiii]@xmath7  excesses seen in our smg sample as seen by the structured [ oiii]@xmath7  line profiles ( asymmetric / broad / multi - peaked ) and the spatially extended emission ( figures  1 & 2 ; see also smail et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in order to examine the possibility that shock - induced gas causes the excess [ oiii]@xmath7  emission , we first search for the signature of shock - excited nebular emission using the simple criterion of [ nii]@xmath148/h@xmath3@xmath149 and [ sii]@xmath150/h@xmath3@xmath151 . using the line ratios from the stacked spectrum of smgs in swinbank et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we find that they lie outside of this shock induced criterion .",
    "however , this criterion is only valid for the shocks with large outflow velocities and a relatively weak starburst radiation field ( veilleux et al .",
    "2005 ) and therefore may not be applicable to the smgs . another test is to use the line ratios of [ oiii]@xmath1/[oiii]@xmath152  and/or [ nii]@xmath153/[nii]@xmath154 , which can be used to estimate the temperature of the nebular gas .",
    "these ratios will provide robust estimates of electron temperature of the emission nebulae , yielding high ( @xmath155k ) temperatures if the gas is ionized mainly by shocks ( as in the cygnus loop ) and lower temperature ( @xmath156k ) for photoionization - dominated clouds seen in star - forming regions ( osterbrock 1989 ) . as these methods rely on measurements of relatively weak emission lines [ oiii]@xmath152  and [ nii]@xmath154 , only our composite spectra have sufficient signal to noise to be useful . from the composite spectrum in figure  3 and also from the total smg composite spectrum in swinbank et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we derive an upper limit on [ oiii]@xmath1/[oiii]@xmath152@xmath157 , and [ nii]@xmath153/[nii]@xmath158 . both ratios imply an upper limit to the electron temperature of less than 20,000k .",
    "this is consistent with the expected temperature in photoionization - dominated clouds ( with an electron density of @xmath159@xmath53 ) .",
    "if the electron density is higher than this , collisional de - excitation begins to play a role and the estimated temperature is reduced .",
    "these results would appear to rule out the dominance of shock excitation similar to that seen in galactic supernova remnants .    as described in dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) , the optical line ratios of seyfert 2s",
    "can also be explained by fast ( 300500kmsec@xmath17 ) shocks , if the precursor hii regions in front of the shock absorb most of the uv photons generated by the shocks .",
    "the calculated electron temperature is @xmath160k for this `` shock + precursor '' model from dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) , which is consistent with the limit on the electron temperatures in smgs estimated from our [ nii ]  and [ oiii ]  emission line ratios .",
    "thus there is a plausible origin for the [ oiii]@xmath7  excess we see compared to typical agn : shocks associated with supernova explosions in relatively dense gas environments , where the precursor hii clouds are still present .",
    "thus we suggests that those sources with high ( @xmath16110 ) [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratios and broad ( @xmath1622000 kmsec@xmath17 ) fwhm of h@xmath0  lines can be explained by a combination of a nls1-type agn residing in an environment of shocks associated with supernova explosions in relatively dense gas .",
    "this would explain all their observable properties , including the high [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratios ( dopita & sutherland 1995 ) .",
    "using near - infrared spectroscopy we have observed the redshifted h@xmath0 the [ oiii]@xmath1  and [ oii]@xmath2  emission lines in a sample of 22 ultra - luminous infrared galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "twenty of the sources in our sample are submillimeter galaxies at @xmath1633.5 . combining our observations with previous studies of the h@xmath3  and the [ nii ]  emission from these galaxies and also with observations of their hard x - ray and far - infrared emission ,",
    "we have placed constraints on the physical properties of this population .",
    "we conclude the following :    1 .",
    "a majority of our sample ( 14/22 ) have spectra which are classified as `` agn '' or `` qso '' based on several restframe optical spectroscopic diagnostics .",
    "specifically , for those sources with detections of the four emission lines necessary to construct a bpt diagram , 8/9 are classified as `` agn '' .",
    "it should be noted that there is no confirmed pure starburst galaxy in our sample , although several sources show intermediate spectral properties .",
    "this is likely to be caused by our sample selection , which is biased towards galaxies with bright near - infrared magnitudes and also to those exhibiting strong line emission .",
    "thus we caution that our results should not be taken as representative of the whole smg population .",
    "2 .   using the h@xmath3/h@xmath0  flux ratio we are able to estimate the internal extinction in our smgs .",
    "we measure a median extinction of @xmath164 , which is similar to the extinction measured in local ulirgs .",
    "this value is also consistent with the estimates from the sed fitting in the restframe uv / optical which are derived under the assumption of a dominant dust - reddened young starburst ( smail et al .",
    "we compare the sfrs derived from the dust - extinction - corrected h@xmath3  luminosities with those derived from the far - infrared luminosities , and find reasonable consistency between these for most of the smgs in our sample .",
    "the fact that the corrected h@xmath3-derived sfrs correspond closely to those estimated from the far - infrared suggests that star - formation is the major contributor to the far - infrared luminosities in smgs .",
    "at least 11/19 of the smgs in our sample show a clear excess in the ratio of their [ oiii]@xmath7  to x - ray luminosities relative to values for local agns .",
    "the five sources with the highest [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratios ( @xmath137 ) , which are classified as `` agn '' from our spectral diagnostics , show this [ oiii]@xmath7  excess .",
    "one possible explanation for the [ oiii]@xmath7  excess is that it is produced by `` compton - thick '' agns .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with the column density measurements ( n@xmath165 ) from fitting of the x - ray spectra for the sources in cdfn and we argue that this is unlikely in most smgs . instead , we suggest that the most plausible cause of the [ oiii]@xmath7  excess is shock - induced emission arising from vigorous star formation ( `` super - wind '' activity ) . this scenario is supported in several galaxies by spatially extended and/or distorted / multiple [ oiii]@xmath7  emission line profiles . furthermore ,",
    "using limits on the electron temperatures from [ oiii ]  and [ nii ]  emission line ratios , we can explain the excess [ oiii]@xmath7  emission as arising from shocks in dense regions within these systems .",
    "the balmer line widths in 9/22 sample galaxies exhibit broad emission components with relatively small fwhms ( @xmath1663700kmsec@xmath17 ) .",
    "three of them are classified as `` qso '' , but have smaller h@xmath0  fwhm ( 21002600kmsec@xmath17 ) than are typical for qsos .",
    "they also have lower [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratios and relatively strong feii emission , both of which are characteristics of local narrow line seyfert 1s . among the other six sources ,",
    "only one shows a low [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratio , and four show high [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratios ( larger than seen in nls1 s ) .",
    "however , the high [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  ratios may arise from [ oiii]@xmath7  excesses due to shock excitation and hence removing this contribution would yield lower ratios more consistent with nls1 classification .",
    "several of these sources also have tentative evidence for feii emission , again characteristic of nls1s . thus , once",
    "account is taken of the potential contribution from shocks to the excess [ oiii]@xmath7  emission , there appears to be close similarities between smgs and nls1s .",
    "the spectral classification of smgs as nls1s may then indicate ( as has been claimed for local nls1s ) that smgs have small mass black holes which are rapidly growing at high accretion rates ( alexander et al .",
    "2005ab ; borys et al .",
    "deeper spectroscopic observations are essential to search for any obscured broad balmer lines which might indicate larger smbh masses and confirm the presence of feii lines which are common in the nls1s .    summarising our results : we conclude that our sample of smgs contains a population of vigorously star - forming galaxies with high sfrs and strong extinction .",
    "the activity in these systems is driving shocks through the dense gas reservoirs they contain and some of this material is being expelled from the galaxies .",
    "in addition , many of our sources show evidence for low - mass , but rapidly growing , super - massive black holes .",

    "<S> we report the results of a systematic near - infrared spectroscopic survey using the subaru , vlt and keck telescopes of a sample of high redshift ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) mainly composed of submillimeter - selected galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our observations span the restframe optical range containing nebular emission lines such as h@xmath0 , [ oiii]@xmath1 , and [ oii]@xmath2 , which are essential for making robust diagnostics of the physical properties of these ulirgs . using the h@xmath3/h@xmath0  emission line ratios </S>",
    "<S> , we derive internal extinction estimates for these galaxies similar to those of local ulirgs : @xmath4 . correcting the h@xmath3 estimates of the star formation rate for dust extinction using the balmer decrement , results in rates which are consistent with those estimated from the far - infrared luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the majority ( @xmath5% ) of our sample show spectral features characteristic of agn ( although we note this partially reflects an observational bias in our sample ) , with @xmath6% exhibiting broad balmer emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> a proportion of these sources show relatively low [ oiii]@xmath7/h@xmath0  line ratios , which are similar to those of narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies suggesting small mass black holes which are rapidly growing . in the subsample of our survey with both [ oiii]@xmath7  and hard x - ray coverage , at least @xmath8% show an excess of [ oiii]@xmath7  emission , by a factor of 510@xmath9 , relative to the hard x - ray luminosity compared to the correlation between these two properties seen in seyferts and qsos locally . from our spectral diagnostics , we propose that the strong [ oiii]@xmath7 emission in these galaxies arises from shocks in dense gaseous regions in this vigorously star - forming population . </S>",
    "<S> we caution that due to sensitivity and resolution limits , our sample is biased to strong line emitters and hence our results do not yet provide a complete view of the physical properties of the whole high - redshift ulirg population . </S>"
