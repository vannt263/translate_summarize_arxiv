    "after many years of investigating hadron - hadron and heavy ion collisions , the study of hadron production remains an active and important field of research .",
    "the lack of detailed knowledge of the microscopic mechanisms has led to the use of many different models , often from completely opposite directions .",
    "thermal models , based on statistical weights for produced hadrons  @xcite , are very successful in describing particle yields at different beam energies  @xcite , especially in heavy ion collisions .",
    "these models assume the formation of a system which is in thermal and chemical equilibrium in the hadronic phase and is characterised by a set of thermodynamic variables for the hadronic phase .",
    "the deconfined period of the time evolution dominated by quarks and gluons remains hidden : full equilibration generally washes out and destroys large amounts of information about the early deconfined phase .",
    "the success of statistical models implies the loss of such information , at least for certain properties , during hadronization .",
    "it is a basic question as to which ones survive the hadronization and behave as messengers from the early ( quark dominated ) stages , especially if these are strongly interacting stages .    in the case of full thermal and chemical equilibrium ,",
    "relativistic statistical distributions can be used , leading to exponential spectra for the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons . on the other hand , experimental data at sps and rhic energies display non - exponential behaviours at high @xmath1 .",
    "one explanation of this deviation is connected to the power - like hadron spectra obtained from perturbative qcd descriptions : the hadron yield from quark and gluon fragmentation overwhelms the thermal ( exponential ) hadron production . however",
    ", this overlap is not trivial .",
    "one can assume the appearance of near - thermal hadron distributions , which is similar to the thermal distribution at lower @xmath1 , but it has a non - exponential tail at higher @xmath1 .",
    "a stationary distribution of strongly interacting hadron gas in a finite volume can be characterized by such a distribution ( or strongly interacting quark matter ) , which will hadronize into hadron matter .",
    "tsallis distributions satisfy such criteria @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will review the tsallis distribution and emphasize the properties most relevant to particle yields .",
    "neglecting quantum statistics , the entropy of a particle of species @xmath2 is given by  @xcite @xmath3 where the mean occupation numbers , @xmath4 , are given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the degeneracy factor of particle @xmath2 .",

    ", the tsallis distribution in this case increases with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the tsallis distribution for quantum statistics has been considered in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 plays a central role in the tsallis distribution and a physical interpretation is needed to appreciate its significance . to this end",
    "we follow the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and write the tsallis distribution as a superposition of boltzmann distributions @xmath19 where the detailed form of the function @xmath20 is given in  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is the standard temperature as it appears in the boltzmann distribution .",
    "it is straightforward to show  @xcite that the average value of @xmath22 is given by the tsallis temperature : @xmath23 while the fluctuation in the temperature is given by the deviation of the tsallis parameter @xmath10 from unity : @xmath24 which becomes zero in the boltzmann limit .",
    "the above leads to the interpretation of the tsallis distribution as a superposition of boltzmann distributions with different temperatures .",
    "the average value of these ( boltzmann ) temperatures is the temperature @xmath15 appearing in the tsallis distribution .",
    "this is the interpretation of the tsallis temperature that we will follow .",
    "the other parameter in the tsallis distribution , @xmath10 , describes the spread around the average value of the ( boltzmann ) temperature @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath25 we have an exact boltzmann distribution , for values of @xmath10 which deviate from 1 , we have a corresponding deviation . from this point of view",
    "the tsallis distribution describes a distribution of ( boltzmann ) temperatures .",
    "a deviation from @xmath25 means that a spread of temperatures is needed instead of a single value .",
    "/d.o.f . of the fits as a function of the tsallis parameter @xmath10.,scaledwidth=80.0%,height=377 ]    in order to identify the energy dependence of the deviation from ideal gas behaviour , thermal fits were performed on yields measured at the cern sps in central pb - pb collisions at 40 agev , 80 agev and 158 agev ( using the same data as analyzed in @xcite ) and yields measured at rhic in central au - au collisions at @xmath26 = 130 agev ( using the same data as analyzed in @xcite ) and at @xmath26 = 200 agev .    in the cern",
    "sps fits , the thermal parameters @xmath15 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 were fit to the data , while @xmath30 and @xmath31 were fixed by the initial baryon - to - charge ratio and strangeness content in the colliding system , respectively .    in the case of the rhic analysis",
    "we again fit @xmath15 , @xmath27 , @xmath31 and @xmath28 to the data .",
    "the use of mid - rapidity data here led to the relaxing of the constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath30 typical in analyzes of 4@xmath32 data .",
    "instead , @xmath30 was set to zero as justified by the observed @xmath33 ratio .",
    "the following expression was used to calculate primordial particle yields , @xmath34^{-1/(q-1)},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the number of valence strange quarks and anti - quarks in species @xmath2 .",
    "the value @xmath36 obviously corresponds to complete strangeness equilibration .",
    "all calculations were done using the thermus package  @xcite .",
    "the most surprising result of our analysis is shown in fig .",
    "( [ chi ] ) : the quality of the fits , as measured by the @xmath37 , improves at first as the tsallis parameter @xmath10 increases . it reaches a minimum value around @xmath38 1.07 for sps beam energy of 158 agev .",
    "this behaviour is repeated at other sps energies with the minima at slightly different values of @xmath10 , i.e. 1.08 for 80 agev and about 1.05 at 40 agev beam energy .",
    "this behaviour is not seen at rhic energies .",
    "clearly , changes in the tsallis parameter @xmath10 have only a small negligible effect on the @xmath0 values at rhic energies , of course , this still leaves open the possibility for @xmath10 values larger than 1  @xcite .",
    "however on the sps data the effect is substantial and changes the interpretation substantially .",
    "one possible interpretation is that at sps energies fluctuations in the freeze - out temperature are substantial .",
    "recently  @xcite a coalescence model with a tsallis distribution for quarks was used to fit the transverse momenta spectra measured at rhic .",
    "this fit does not include decays from resonances and therefore can not be compared directly to ours since decays can substantially modify the transverse momenta , also the emerging hadrons are not in a tsallis - type equilibrium gas , which is an assumption of the present analysis .",
    "the authors obtained values for the tsallis parameter @xmath10 which are remarkably similar for all particle species considered , i.e. @xmath39 which can not be excluded by our analysis .",
    "the freeze - out temperature @xmath15 decreases , as expected , with increasing values of @xmath10 .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the tsallis distribution is always larger than the boltzmann one ( as long as @xmath17 ) .",
    "hence , in order to match the same particle yields one has to adjust @xmath15 to lower values .",
    "this is seen at all energies in fig .",
    "however , the drop in @xmath15 , turns out to be quite drastic numerically .",
    "in fact , the decrease in particle numbers has to be compensated by increases in all other thermodynamic variables .",
    "the ( modest ) increase in the baryon chemical potential is shown in fig .",

    "the strangeness non - equilibrium factor @xmath40 as shown in fig .",
    "[ gammas ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the tsallis distribution leads to a much better chemical equilibrium than the corresponding boltzmann distribution with @xmath41 . in all cases",
