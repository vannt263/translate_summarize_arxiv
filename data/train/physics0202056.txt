    "the origin of the genetic code has been a subject of intense research since its structure was completely elucidated in the early 1970 s . in subsequent years , the scientific community has produced several theories in order to explain why the genetic code has this structure . among these theories ,",
    "the most prominent ones are the stereochemical theory , the frozen - accident theory and the coevolutionary theory @xcite-@xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", these theories try to account for the structure of the genetic code by looking at the interactions between codons and amino acids , the biosynthetic relationships among different amino acids and how the metabolic pathways between them have been selected throughout evolution .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that all the codons are made up of three nucleotides , has mostly been taken for granted and barely brought into question .",
    "one of the most widely used arguments found in the literature to explain the trinucleotide codon structure of the genetic code , was given by sidney brenner in 1961 @xcite . according to this argument ,",
    "codons are made up of three nucleotides ( or bases , for short ) because there are 20 amino acids to be specified by the genetic information expressed by a 4 letter `` alphabet '' ( the four bases a , g , c , u ) .",
    "if codons were composed of only two bases , there would be only 16 different combinations ( @xmath3 ) , which are not enough to specify for 20 amino acids .",
    "if instead , codons were made up of more than three bases , there would be at least 256 combinations ( @xmath4 ) , and these are too many for only 20 amino acids .",
    "hence , less than three bases per codon are not enough , and more than three would imply an excessive degeneration of the code .",
    "the result coming out from this argument is that three bases per codon is the optimal `` bit of information '' that can be used in order to specify for the 20 different amino acids by means of a 4 letter `` alphabet '' .",
    "the above argument , however , does not constitute an explanation by itself , mainly because it only moves the question of `` why three ? '' to the questions of `` why twenty ? '' or for that matter `` why four ? '' .",
    "there is no reason for the genetic information to codify for only 20 amino acids since living organisms use more than those specified by the genetic code @xcite .",
    "in addition , this argument assumes that all the codons must have the same length ( number of bases ) , even though more efficient codes can be obtained by allowing the length of the codons to vary @xcite . finally , _ given _ that 20 amino acids have to be specified by using 4 different bases",
    ", brenner s argument leads to the simplest code that might be thought of .",
    "but even in such a case , simplicity has to be accounted for as a relevant criterium .    in this work",
    "we address the question of the origin of the three - base codon structure of the genetic code from a dynamical point of view .",
    "we consider a simple molecular machine model which captures some of the principal features of the interaction between primitive realizations of the ribosome and of the mrna .",
    "our main objective is to present a dynamical scenario , compatible with prebiotic conditions , of how the triplet structure of the genetic code could have arisen .",
    "the model we propose is a follow up of the one introduced by aldana , cocho and martnez - mekler @xcite and is consistent with the current evidence suggesting the `` rna world '' hypothesi1s @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the crucial molecules involved in the prebiotic and protobiotic processes , that eventually led to codification and translation mechanisms of the genetic information , were rna related.q    in our model , based on the setup depicted in fig .",
    "1 , a short one - dimensional polymer composed of @xmath5 monomers interacts with a much longer one , via electrostatic forces . in order to avoid confusion , from now on",
    "we will refer to the short polymer as `` the chain '' , and to the long polymer simply as `` the polymer '' .",
    "the electrostatic interaction between the chain and the polymer is due to the presence of electric charges , or multipolar moments , in the monomers of both the chain and the polymer .",
    "the charges of the monomers of the chain and of the polymer are assigned at random following a uniform distribution .",
    "therefore , the resulting chain - polymer interaction potential has a random profile .",
    "the chain is allowed to move along the polymer , but is constrained to remain at a fixed perpendicular distance @xmath6 from it .",
    "consequently , transport is one - dimensional .",
    "one of our main results is to show that under very general conditions , a dynamics is attained in which the chain moves along the polymer in effective `` steps '' whose mean length is three monomers .",
    "we argue that this dynamical feature may be one of the underlying causes of the three base codon structure of the genetic code .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ themodel ] describes in detail the model and the assumptions introduced . in section [ unichain ] we recall some statistical aspects of our previous analysis @xcite of the random interaction potentials between the chain and the polymer for the simplest case in which the former is composed of just one particle ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we exhibit numerically that , even in this simple case , the mean distance @xmath8 between consecutive minima along the interaction potential is very close to three : @xmath9 ( taking the monomer length as spatial unit ) . after retrieving the analytical expression for this distance @xcite ,",
    "we then look into the probability @xmath10 of two neighboring potential minima being separated by a distance @xmath11 .",
    "subindex @xmath12 refers to the number of different types of monomers in the polymer and in the chain .",
    "this probability function shows that , even though the mean distance @xmath8 is close to three , the most probable distance between consecutive minima is @xmath13 for @xmath14 . in section [ realseq ]",
    "the monomer charges along the polymer are assigned in correspondence with protein - coding regions of the genome of real organisms ( e.g. _ drosophila _ or _",
    "e. coli _ ) instead of at random . for this case ,",
    "the probability function @xmath15 is modified so that not only the mean distance is @xmath9 , but also the most probable one happens to be @xmath16 .    in section [ polychain ]",
    "we introduce the more realistic case @xmath17 , which takes into account the fact that the ribosome is not a point particle , that it has spatial structure and presents several simultaneous contact points between its own rrna and the mrna polymer . for small chain lengths ( @xmath18 ) ,",
    "the probability distribution @xmath15 is indicative of wide fluctuations and has a form strongly dependent on the particular assignment of charges in the chain .",
    "one of our main findings is that for such chains the most likely configurations are those in which both , the mean distance @xmath8 and the most probable one @xmath19 are equal to three , _ even when the monomer charges along the polymer and the chain are assigned at random_. in section [ dynamics ] we analyze the dynamics resulting from the model when an external force is pulling the chain , forcing it to move as a rigid object along the polymer .",
    "the power spectrum of the velocity of the chain reveals that , under some very general circumstances , for small chain lengths ( @xmath18 ) , there is a sharp periodicity in the dynamics of the system , with a slowing down of the velocity of the chain every three monomers .",
    "finally , section [ summary ] is devoted to the discussion of the results and their relevance to the origin of the genetic code .",
    "the model we propose consists of a chain of @xmath5 monomers interacting with a very long polymer composed of @xmath20 monomers , with @xmath21 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the chain is constrained to remain at a given distance @xmath6 perpendicular to the polymer and is allowed to move in along the polymer , we shall define @xmath22 as its position in this direction relative to the polymer .",
    "we will denote the monomer charges in the chain and in the polymer by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we should mention that by `` charge '' we do not necessarily mean coulomb charge .",
    "both @xmath23 and @xmath24 could be dipolar moments , induced polarizabilities , or similar quantities resulting from electrostatic interactions between chain monomers and polymer monomers with potentials of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 characterizes the `` charge '' type .",
    "we will assume that all the monomers in the chain , and separately , all the monomers in the polymer , are of the same nature , namely , all of them are either coulomb charges , or dipolar moments , or polarizable molecules , etc . in addition , taking into account that in the origin of life conditions the genetic molecules were not yet likely to convey any structured information , we will consider the charges @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be discrete independent random variables , acquiring one of the @xmath12 different values @xmath27 with the same probability .",
    "hence , the probability function @xmath28 for both , the @xmath23 and @xmath24 variables , will be    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the dirac delta function . in general , in this work we will take the values @xmath27 as integers .",
    "parameter @xmath12 represents the number of different types of monomers from which the polymer and the chain are made of . for the case of real genetic sequences",
    "@xmath31 , but we will not restrict the value of @xmath12 to be 4 .    all the monomers will have the same length @xmath32 , which we take as the spatial unit of measure : @xmath33 . we also assume the charge in each of the monomers to be uniformly distributed along the length @xmath32 , so that the charge density @xmath34 in the jth - monomer of the polymer , for example , is a constant whose value is @xmath35 .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth mentioning that the dynamics of the model does not depend strongly on the particular shape of the monomer charge density @xmath34 , as long it is a smooth function of @xmath22 ( `` smooth '' in the sense of differentiability ) .    with the preceding assumptions ,",
    "the interaction potential @xmath36 between the ith - monomer in the chain and the jth - monomer in the polymer is given by    @xmath37^{\\alpha/2 } } \\label{vmm}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is a constant whose value depends on the unit system used to measure the physical quantities . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath32 has already been set equal to @xmath39 .",
    "parameter @xmath26 characterizes the kind of interaction between the chain and the polymer : @xmath40 corresponds to an ion - ion interaction , @xmath41 represents an ion - dipole interaction , and so forth . note",
    "that this parameter does not depend on the indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 , since all the monomers in the chain are of the same nature and those in the polymer are themselves of the same nature , differing from each other only in the value of the charge they contain .",
    "the overall interaction potential @xmath44 between the whole chain and the entire polymer is given by the superposition of the individual potentials @xmath36 :    @xmath45    equations ( [ vmm ] ) and ( [ vcp ] ) establish the type of random potentials we will be considering .",
    "our first aim is to analyze the spatial structure of these potentials , giving their statistical characterization .",
    "this will be done in the three following sections .",
    "subsequently , we will consider the dynamics of the chain moving along the polymer interacting with it by means of a random potential , subject to an external driving force and seek under what conditions , if any , transport in `` steps '' of three monomers can be achieved .",
    "let us start with the simplest case @xmath7 , in which the chain consists of just one monomer .",
    "we will refer to this case as the `` single - monomer - chain '' case , and to the chain simply as `` the particle '' .",
    "the reason to consider this simple situation is twofold : on one hand , it is useful in order to introduce the relevant ideas behind the model . on the other hand ,",
    "it is simple enough as to obtain exact analytical results in a more o less straightforward way . in previous work",
    "we have already analyzed some statistical properties of the random potentials given by expressions ( [ vmm ] ) and ( [ vcp ] ) for the case @xmath7 @xcite . after a short review of some of those results we center our attention on the probability distribution @xmath15 .",
    "the overall particle - polymer interaction potential is given by    @xmath46^{\\alpha/2}}\\ ] ]    note that in the previous expression we have set @xmath47 , the only charge in the chain , equal to one .",
    "fig.2 shows three graphs of the potential @xmath44 for @xmath48 and different values of the parameter @xmath26 . to generate these graphs , the following probability function for the charges @xmath24",
    "was used :    @xmath49    namely , each one of the variables @xmath24 acquired one of the six different values @xmath50 with probability @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . in fig.2 , the random realization of the charges @xmath24 along the polymer was the same for the three graphs .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the distribution of maxima and minima along the potential does not change by varying the value of the parameter @xmath26 , in the sense that all the maxima and minima remain essentially at the same positions .",
    "what occurs as @xmath26 takes larger and larger values is that the potential becomes a step - like function .",
    "fig.3 presents an analogous situation , but now keeping @xmath26 constant ( @xmath41 ) and varying @xmath6 .",
    "the behavior of the potential is similar to the previous case : the potential becomes a step - like function as @xmath6 decreases and the positions of the maxima and minima are not appreciably modified .",
    "the above considerations exhibit that for small values of @xmath6 , say @xmath53 , the distribution of maxima and minima along the potential is entirely determined by the distribution of charges along the polymer and is independent of the particular values acquired by the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , in order to find out the distribution of maxima and minima along the interaction potential , it is possible to substitute the continuous random potential given by expressions ( [ vmm ] ) and ( [ vcp ] ) , by the equivalent step - like potential defined by    @xmath54 \\label{vesc}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is the heaviside function is defined as @xmath56 if @xmath57 and @xmath58 if @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is a random variable whose value is directly proportional to the charge @xmath61 of the jth - monomer in the polymer :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the charge of the particle ( the only monomer in the chain ) .    since the random charges @xmath24 are statistically independent , so are the @xmath64 .",
    "expression ( [ vesc ] ) , which we will refer to as the * step - like limit * , is suitable for the analytical determination of the probability function of the distances between consecutive potential minima .",
    "this probability function gives important information concerning the dynamics of the system .",
    "if some external force is acting on the particle ( or the chain ) , forcing it to move in one direction ( right or left ) along the polymer , the particle will spend more time in the energy minima than in the maxima .",
    "such a movement may be interpreted by considering the particle as `` jumping '' from one minimum to the next ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the mean distance between consecutive minima in the potentials shown in fig.2 and fig.3 is nearly three . in fig.2",
    "there are 33 minima distributed among 100 monomers , and consequently the mean distance between consecutive minima in this case is @xmath65 .",
    "analogously , the mean distance between neighboring minima in fig.3 is @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , it is expected that in its motion along the polymer , the velocity of the particle will slow down , on average , every three monomers , being momentarily `` trapped '' in each of the potential minima .    by using the step - like limit , in reference",
    "@xcite we have shown that the mean distance @xmath8 between consecutive potential minima for a long polymer ( the large n limit ) is given by    @xmath67    where @xmath12 is the number of different monomer types .",
    "the above equation shows that the mean distance @xmath8 is always between 3 and 4 , and approaches 3 asymptotically as @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath31 ( the biological value ) we have @xmath69 .    in order to characterize the fluctuations around the mean distance @xmath8 , it is useful to compute the probability distribution function @xmath15 , which we recall , gives the probability of two consecutive minima being separated by a distance @xmath11 when there are @xmath12 different types of monomers . in the step - like limit ,",
    "this computation is carried out by counting all the configurations of the step - like variables @xmath64 in which there are two minima , one at @xmath60 and the other at @xmath70 , with no other minima in between .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig.5a . since in the step - like limit the interaction potential",
    "is constant along every monomer , we will adopt the convention to measure the distance @xmath11 between two adjacent minima from the mid point of the first minimum to the mid point of the second one , as illustrated in fig.5b . with the above convention",
    ", the resulting distances @xmath11 can only acquire integer or half - integer values . for a finite number @xmath12 of different charges ,",
    "the explicit calculation of the probability function @xmath15 consists mainly on counting configurations , though conceptually straightforward , it involves a considerable amount of algebra .",
    "here we present the final expressions :    @xmath71    if @xmath11 is integer : @xmath72 , and @xmath73 if @xmath11 is half - integer : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 $ ] . in the above expressions",
    ", @xmath76 is a polynomial whose degree and coefficients depend on @xmath12 . for @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath31 the polynomials",
    "are given by    @xmath79\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the case of @xmath80 we have also derived a closed expression @xcite , which has a much simpler form :    @xmath81    the preceding distributions are plotted in fig.6 .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the most probable distance @xmath19 between consecutive potential minima is @xmath13 , except for the case @xmath77 in which @xmath16 .",
    "hence , according to the transport mechanism suggested in fig.4 , whenever there are more than two different types of monomers , the particle will move along the polymer in `` jumps '' whose mean length is close to three , but whose most probable length is actually two .",
    "the difference between the mean distance @xmath8 and the most probable distance @xmath19 is due to the presence of `` tails '' in the probability function @xmath15 .",
    "namely , to the fact that @xmath15 has non zero values even for large @xmath11 . nevertheless , in section [ polychain ] we will show that these `` tails '' can be shrunk almost to zero when the chain is made up of more than one particle ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this is one of the main results of this paper .    to end this section ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that half - integer distances between two neighboring minima occur when one or both of these minima extend over several monomers ( see fig.5b ) . in these configurations ,",
    "the charges of the adjacent monomers constituting the extended minimum have the same value .",
    "configurations in which groups of adjacent equally charged monomers occur , are less likely than configurations in which adjacent monomers have different charges , and the former tend to disappear as @xmath12 increases ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "the charges @xmath24 along the polymer can be assigned in correspondence with the genetic sequence of an organism , rather than in a random way .",
    "the purpose of doing so is to find out how the potential minima and maxima along real genetic sequences are distributed , and to compare the resulting distribution with the one corresponding to the random case . since",
    "genetic sequences are made out of four different bases ( a , u , c and g ) we consider four different possible values @xmath82 for the charges @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath31 . to proceed further ,",
    "it is necessary to establish a correspondence between the charge values @xmath83 and the four bases a , u , c and g. an arbitrary look up table is the following :    @xmath84    with the above correspondence , if the jth - base in a given genetic sequence happens to be a , for example , then the charge of the corresponding jth - monomer in the polymer will be @xmath85 .    figure fig.7a shows the probability distribution @xmath86 computed numerically by using a _ drosophila melanogaster _ protein - coding sequence , 45500 bases in length (",
    "several genes were concatenated to construct this sequence ) .",
    "the mean distance between consecutive potential minima for this sequence is @xmath87 and , as follows from the figure , the most probable distance is @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , in the `` real sequence case '' not only is the mean distance @xmath8 very close to 3 , but also the most probable distance @xmath19 turns out to be 3 .",
    "a comparison of fig.6c with fig.7a , shows that for protein - coding genetic sequences , the potential minima along the polymer are more often separated by three monomers than in the random case .",
    "when protein - coding sequences are used , the value of @xmath86 increases at @xmath88 and decreases at @xmath89 .",
    "the above behavior does not occur when non - coding sequences of the genome are used for the monomer charge assignment along the polymer .",
    "fig.7b shows the probability function @xmath86 for the case in which the monomer charges are in correspondence with an intergenic sequence of the _ drosophila s _ genome .",
    "the length of the sequence is again 45500 bases . as can be seen from the figure , in this case the probability function @xmath86 looks much more like the one obtained in the random case .",
    "it is important to remark that the behavior of @xmath86 exhibited in fig.7a for real protein - coding sequences does not depend on the particular correspondence ( [ corres ] ) between bases and charge values being used , as long as they are of similar order of magnitude and they can allow for an order relation .",
    "these conditions hold for the four bases a , t , c and g which have charges of the same order of magnitude @xcite appearing in expression ( [ vmm])]and are fulfilled by our present choice of @xmath90 .",
    "the order relation is necessary for the interaction potential to have maxima and minima .",
    "it is worth asking the effect that changes in the order relation have on the probability function @xmath86 .",
    "there are 24 possible order relations among the four bases a , t , c , and g ( @xmath91 permutations ) .",
    "the 24 probability functions @xmath86 corresponding to these permutations are plotted in fig.8a for _ drosophila s _ protein - coding sequence . as can be seen from the figure , the probability functions basically overlap , independently of the particular order relation between the bases , with a peak at @xmath16 .",
    "the invariance of @xmath86 under base permutations also holds for non - coding sequences as is shown in fig .",
    "8.b . , where @xmath13 for intergenic sequences of drosophila _",
    "drosophilas_. this value of @xmath19 suggests that non - coding sequences behave as random structures .",
    "0.3 in    the `` peaking at @xmath16 '' of the probability function @xmath92 seems to be a general characteristic associated with the protein - coding sequences of living organisms , not only with _",
    "drosophila_. in fig.9 we show the probability functions obtained from protein - coding sequences of different organisms , and in all the cases the probability functions present their highest value at @xmath16 ( the mean distance @xmath8 is also very close to @xmath93 ) .",
    "the fact that the above characteristic is absent in non - coding genetic sequences may be interpreted in evolutionary terms . genetic sequences directly involved in the protein - translation processes were selected ( among other things ) as to bring the distance between consecutive potential minima closer to 3 , both in mean and frequency of occurrence .",
    "this interpretation raises a question : how likely is it to obtain a randomly generated sequence with a structure similar to that of protein - coding sequences ?",
    "in other words , if we generate a random sequence and compute its probability function @xmath15 , how likely is it to come up with a probability function peaking at @xmath16 ? .",
    "in order to answer this question , we define the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 as    0.3 in    @xmath96    if the probability function @xmath86 associated with a given sequence has its highest value at @xmath16 , then the corresponding parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 will both be greater than one . otherwise , one or both of these parameters will be smaller than one .",
    "fig.10a is a plot of @xmath94 vs. @xmath95 for 1000 random sequences , each one consisting of 500 bases ( which is a typical length of sequences coding functional proteins @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that only a small fraction of the points ( about 0.224 ) fall in region i , for which @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the rest of the points fall in region ii , in which @xmath99 and @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the probability of having a random sequence , 500 bases long , whose consecutive potential minima are more often separated by a distance @xmath16 , is close to @xmath100 .    on the other hand ,",
    "figs.10b - f show similar graphs , but using protein - coding sequences of real organisms .",
    "these graphs were constructed by analyzing short coding sequences 500 bases in length .",
    "the fraction of points falling in region i ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) for the different organisms of fig.10 is summarized in the following table :    [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     therefore , when a collective interaction between the polymer and the chain prevails , a remarkable property arises : the probability of having a random interaction potential , whose consecutive minima are more often separated by three monomers , is the largest .",
    "recent experimental evidence suggests that the ribosome - mrna system presents a ratchet - like behavior in the protein synthesis translocation process @xcite . in this view , the ribosome is tightly attached to the mrna thread in the absence of gtp .",
    "this is so because the channel in the ribosome through which the mrna passes , is more or less closed .",
    "when a gtp molecule is supplied ( and transformed into gdp ) , this channel opens leaving the mrna thread free to move one codon .",
    "subsequently the mrna passage in the ribosome closes again , trapping the mrna molecule .    in this clamping mechanism",
    "several physicochemical factors are involved , which if taken into account in detail would lead to complex dynamical equations hard to handle . in this work",
    "our approach is to look into the behavior of oversimplified molecular models which might capture some of the essential dynamical features of the system and may shed some light on how this mechanism could have arisen in the origin of life conditions .    in our modelling the dynamics of the system is governed by the application of an external force @xmath101 to the chain in the horizontal direction , i.e. parallel to the polymer . by this means the chain will be forced to move along the polymer . in principle , the force @xmath101 may be time dependent , but we will restrict ourselves to a constant term . this force might come from a chemical pump ( like gdp ) or from any other electromagnetic force present in prebiotic conditions .",
    "the only purpose of this force in our model is to drive the chain along the polymer ( which is assumed to be fixed , @xmath21 limit ) , avoiding it from getting trapped in some of the minima of the polymer - chain interaction potential @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , we will also assume that @xmath101 satisfies @xmath103 max@xmath104 .",
    "our analysis relies on newton s equation of motion in a high friction regime , where inertial effects can be neglected .",
    "this regime actually exists in biological molecular ratchets similar to the one we are considering @xcite . under such conditions ,",
    "the newton s equation of motion acquires the form    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the friction coefficient . in what follows",
    ", we will set @xmath107 , which is equivalent to setting the measure of the time unit .",
    "the above , though a deterministic equation , gives rise to a random dynamics due to the randomness of the interaction potential @xmath108 . in order to start analyzing this random dynamics ,",
    "let us consider first the single - monomer - chain case @xmath7 . in this case , as before",
    ", we will refer to the chain simply as `` the particle '' .",
    "in fig.14a we show a typical realization of the velocity of the particle @xmath109 as a function of its position @xmath22 along the polymer .",
    "this graph was constructed by solving numerically the equation of motion ( [ newton ] ) , using the fourth order runge - kuta method .",
    "the parameter values used were @xmath41 and @xmath48 , and the monomer charge values were @xmath110 ( case @xmath31 ) .",
    "fig.14b shows the local - transit times of the particle along a short segment of the polymer ( 40 monomers in length ) .",
    "this transit time is represented in arbitrary units , and was computed by counting how many time steps the particle spent in every spatial interval @xmath111 throughout the polymer . in the graph shown , the value of @xmath111 was @xmath112 .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that , in its way along the polymer , the particle spends more time in certain regions than in others , the former being more or less regularly spaced along the polymer .    in order to find out the spatial regularities in the dynamics of the system , it is convenient to take the fourier transform of the velocity @xmath109 of the particle .",
    "let us call @xmath113 the fourier transform of @xmath109 , @xmath114 being the fourier variable conjugate to @xmath22 .",
    "fig.15 shows the fourier power spectrum of the velocity , @xmath115 , for two different realizations of monomer charges in the polymer .",
    "the parameter values in fig.15a and fig.15b are @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "these graphs were computed for the case @xmath31 , using the charge values @xmath118 . from the figure ,",
    "it is evident that there exists a dominant frequency @xmath119 in the power spectrum of the velocity ( the highest peak ) , whose corresponding spatial periodicity is @xmath120 .",
    "the power spectrum reveals a dynamical regularity in the motion of the particle throughout the polymer .",
    "this regularity is inherited from the one present in the random potential , in the sense that the particle spends more time in the minima than in the maxima .",
    "the consequence is a slowing down of the velocity nearly every three monomers , which is reflected in the power spectrum .",
    "our interpretation is that the peak occurring in the power spectrum of the velocity conveys the information on the average distance @xmath8 between consecutive potential minima , which for the case @xmath31 is @xmath121 .      as in section [ realseq ]",
    ", we can assign the charges along the polymer in correspondence with the genetic sequence of real organisms . in order to do that",
    ", we will use the same base - charge correspondence as in expression ( [ corres ] ) .",
    "the objective is to find out how the dynamics of the system changes when using real genetic sequences instead of random ones . in",
    "what follows , the value of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath6 will be @xmath40 , @xmath48 .",
    "the power spectrum of the velocity of the particle throughout the polymer , when using protein - coding sequences of different organisms , is shown in fig.16 . to generate these graphs , short coding sequences of several organisms , each 10000 monomers in length , were used .",
    "two points are worth noticing in this figure .",
    "first , the peak in the power spectrum is much higher than in the random case .",
    "this indicates that there is a much more well defined periodicity in the dynamics generated by interaction potentials when protein - coding sequences are used .",
    "second , the spatial periodicity reflected in the peak of the power spectrum is much closer to @xmath93 than in the random case .",
    "this dynamical behavior is not present when real but non - coding sequences are used .",
    "for example , in fig.17 we show the power spectrum of the velocity of the particle along the polymer , for two cases in which the monomer charges in the polymer were assigned in correspondence with intergenic regions of two organisms . as can be seen , the structure of such spectra is similar to the one obtained in the random case . in this sense ,",
    "intergenic regions again seem to have a random structure .",
    "the fact that the power spectrum corresponding to protein - coding sequences exhibits a very sharp periodicity at @xmath122 , whereas the one corresponding to non - coding sequences does not , has already been reported in the literature @xcite . nonetheless , in these previous works",
    "the power spectrum of the `` bare '' genetic sequences is analyzed , namely , without considering any kind of interaction potential or dynamical behavior .",
    "what we have shown here , though , is that this `` structural '' periodicity around three transforms into a _",
    "dynamical periodicity _ in the motion of the particle along the polymer .",
    "the most interesting dynamics occurs when an extended chain is interacting with the polymer .",
    "in such a situation , a collective interaction prevails . at every moment",
    "there are several contact points between the chain and the polymer .",
    "as we have already pointed out , collective interaction between the chain and the polymer gives rise to a widely fluctuating probability function @xmath15 .",
    "the same occurs with the power spectrum of the velocity of the chain along the polymer .",
    "however , these fluctuations , far from being annoying , produce a much richer dynamical behavior than in the single - monomer - chain case .    in fig.18",
    "we show the power spectra of the velocity of the chain along the polymer for two different random realizations of monomer charges in the chain .",
    "the charges in the polymer were the same in both cases .",
    "these graphs were constructed with a polymer 500 monomers in length and a 10-monomer chain .",
    "the parameter values used were @xmath48 and @xmath40 .",
    "also , the charge values were , as above @xmath123 . from the figure , it is apparent that the power spectrum of the velocity exhibits a very well defined dominant frequency , _ even though the charges in both the polymer and the chain were assigned at random_. the power spectrum in fig.18a presents a dominant frequency corresponding to a spatial periodicity @xmath124 , whereas the corresponding periodicity in the power spectrum shown in fig.18b is @xmath122 .",
    "we should explain this difference .",
    "the power spectrum appearing in fig.18a was constructed by using a polymer and a chain whose associated probability function @xmath92 has the same shape as the one of fig.12a .",
    "namely , for this system the probability function has a very high value at @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand , the power spectrum in fig.18b corresponds to a system whose probability function has a very sharp peak at @xmath16 , as the one shown in fig.12b . from our numerical simulations",
    ", we can conclude that _ whenever the probability function has a sharp maximum at a distance @xmath19 , the power spectrum of the velocity also presents a sharp peak corresponding to a spatial periodicity @xmath125 . _",
    "as we have seen , in the collective - interaction case the most probable configurations are those in which the probability function @xmath92 has its highest value at @xmath16 ( see fig.13 ) .",
    "therefore , if we assign at random the monomer charges in the polymer and in the chain , with high probability we will come up with a dynamics possessing a very well defined periodicity : the chain will move along the polymer in `` jumps '' whose length is nearly three monomers .",
    "the results presented throughout this work suggest a possible scenario for the origin of the three base codon structure of the genetic code . in this scenario ,",
    "primitive one dimensional molecular machines , initially with a random structure , exhibited a regular dynamics with a `` preference '' for a movement in steps of three bases . by `` steps '' we mean a slowing down of the velocity of the chain along the polymer , nearly every three monomers ( see fig.14b ) . even in the simplest case in which the chain consists of only one monomer",
    ", the above dynamical regularity is apparent .",
    "we can think of the dynamics of primitive molecular machines as being `` biased towards three '' .",
    "the preceding property is quite robust inasmuch as it hardly depends on the particular kind of interaction between the polymer and the chain .",
    "on one hand , the kind of electrostatic potentials we have used is representative of the actual interaction potentials between particles occurring in nature .",
    "these potentials are characterized in our model by the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "we have also seen that the distribution distances between neighboring maxima and minima along the interaction potential , characterized by the probability function @xmath15 , does not depend on this parameter ( for small values of @xmath6 ) , i.e. it will be the same whether the interaction is coulombian or dipolar or of any other ( electrostatic ) type .",
    "on the other hand , the spatial distribution of interaction potential minima also does not depend on the particular values of the monomer charges @xmath24 and @xmath23 , as long as these values are of the same order of magnitude",
    ". an important feature that the charges must comply with is that they take more than two different values .",
    "this allows for an order relation to be established among the different types of monomers , leading to a maxima and minima structure of the interaction potential .",
    "the probability function @xmath15 , which gives the probability of two consecutive minima being separated by a distance @xmath11 , only depends on @xmath12 , namely , on the number of different types of monomers . as @xmath12 increases , the mean distance @xmath8 between consecutive potential minima approaches three",
    "nevertheless , in the particle ( single - monomer - chain ) case , the most probable distance is @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 ) .    still in this particle case ,",
    "considerable changes take place when the charges along the polymer are assigned in correspondence with protein - coding genetic sequences of real organisms . in this case , not only is the mean distance @xmath8 between neighboring potential minima nearly three , but also the most probable one , @xmath19 , happens to be three .",
    "this is a remarkable property of protein - coding sequences , perhaps acquired throughout evolution .",
    "furhtermore the fact that this `` refinement '' is absent in non - coding sequences of real organisms , strongly suggests that it is a consequence of the dynamical processes involved in the protein synthesis mechanisms .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the results obtained when the _ dynamics _ of the particle moving along the polymer is considered . in the random sequence case , there are dominant frequencies in the power spectrum of the particle velocity related with the spatial regularities of the interaction potential .",
    "moreover in the protein - coding sequence case , the power spectrum of the velocity shows a very well defined periodicity corresponding almost exactly to a spatial distance @xmath126 .",
    "again , this behavior does not occur for non - coding sequences of real organisms , which are not involved in the translation processes .",
    "a richer dynamics emerges when the chain is composed of several monomers . in this ,",
    "more realistic , collective - interaction case , the probability function @xmath15 presents very wide fluctuations , depending on the particular assignment of monomer charges in the chain .",
    "nevertheless , the most probable configurations are those for which the probability function has its highest value at @xmath16 . for these configurations",
    ", the power spectrum of the chain velocity along the polymer exhibits a very well defined spatial periodicity at @xmath122 .",
    "our results suggest an origin of life scenario in which primordial molecular machines of chains moving along polymers in quasi one - dimensional geometries , that eventually led to the protein synthesis processes , were biased towards a dynamics favoring the motion in `` steps '' or `` jumps '' of three monomers .",
    "the higher likelyhood of these primitive``ribosomes '' may have led to the present ribosomal dynamics where mrna moves along rrna in a channel conformed by the ribosome .",
    "dynamics may have acted in this sense as one of the evolutionary filter favoring the three base codon composition of the genetic code .    0.5 in * acknowledgements *",
