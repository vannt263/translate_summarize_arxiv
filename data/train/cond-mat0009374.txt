    "the optical properties of semiconductors near the band  edge are substantially influenced by the attractive electron  hole interaction which leads to pronounced excitonic lines and enhanced absorption above the band gap@xcite .",
    "these phenomena become even more pronounced in systems of reduced effective dimensionality such as quantum  wells , wires or dots . in addition , the influence of disorder and impurity scattering increases with decreasing dimension . the latter phenomenon ,",
    "however , is considered usually phenomenologically by replacing the light frequency @xmath0 by @xmath1 , or convoluting the spectrum with an appropriate smoothing function of width @xmath2 .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the interplay between excitonic effects and disorder  scattering in quasi one  dimensional structures , in particular quantum wires which possess a periodic step  like modulation along the one  dimensional direction , ( quantum box structures , qbs ) , fig .  1 .",
    "such structures have been proposed as favorite candidates to generate bloch oscillations @xcite , other examples are quasi one  dimensional molecular crystals @xcite , yet no detailed theoretical study of the optical properties has been published .",
    "the optical properties of one  dimensional systems are exceptional as even a small attractive electron  hole interaction leads to a drastic reduction in the oscillator strength at the gap energy so that the identification of the gap energy from optical absorption data is nontrivial .",
