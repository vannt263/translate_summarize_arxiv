    "carbon is considered as the most active element in the periodic table due to its broad sp , sp@xmath0 and sp@xmath1 hybridizing ability . besides the four best - known carbon allotropes , graphite , cubic - diamond , hexagonal diamond and amorphous carbon ,",
    "an unknown superhard phase of carbon has been reported in experiment @xcite along with the structural phase transition in cold compressed graphite .",
    "several structures have been proposed as the candidates for this superhard phase , such as the monoclinic m - carbon @xcite , cubic body center c4 carbon ( bct - c4 ) @xcite and the orthorhombic w - carbon @xcite .",
    "the cohesive energy of the most stable w - carbon is about 160 mev per atom higher than that of diamond , indicating that other more stable carbon phases may exist .",
    "very recently , another new carbon allotrope , named as z - carbon , was proposed and investigated at almost the same time by three independent research groups @xcite .",
    "z - carbon is more stable ( its cohesive energy is about 129 mev per atom larger than that of diamond ) and harder than w - carbon .",
    "moreover , its transition pressure is around 10 gpa which is lower than that of w - carbon .",
    "thus , it is believed that the formation in the process of the cold compressing graphite prefers z - carbon rather than w - carbon .",
    "although none of them can fit the experimental results satisfactorily , these theoretically proposed phases are significant in understanding the experimental process of cold compressing of graphite",
    ". +     +    the formation of the new carbon phase needs large lattice distortions , such as buckling between adjacent carbon layers of graphite .",
    "therefore , the phase transition depends not only on the particular nucleation history @xcite but also on the structure of the starting graphitic material .",
    "intuitively , such buckling between carbon layers will start from the natural ab stacking graphite rather than the aa stacking graphite chosen in previous theoretical studies @xcite . from this hypothesis ,",
    "we propose two new superhard crystals , namely h - carbon and s - carbon , as potential candidates for the experimentally observed intermediate state of carbon , which can be formed from compressing ab stacking graphite .",
    "our first - principles calculations based on density functional theory show that both the allotropes are transparent wide band gap insulators and their hardness are comparable to that of diamond .",
    "s - carbon has the lowest enthalpy compared with bct - c4 carbon , m - carbon , w - carbon , and z - carbon and is the most stable new carbon phase theoretically proposed until now .",
    "h - carbon is always more stable than w - carbon and m - carbon . when the pressure is above 5.93 gpa ( 10.08 gpa ) , s - carbon ( h - carbon ) is more favorable than graphite . +",

    "all calculations are carried out using the density functional theory within both local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and general gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite as implemented in vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite . in evaluating of the transition pressure from graphite to each superhard phases",

    "3(c ) and ( d ) show the electronic band structures and densities of states of h - carbon and s - carbon derived from gga .",
    "the densities of states indicate that the valence band maximum for both h - carbon and s - carbon is mainly contributed from the 2p states of carbon , whereas the conduction band minimum comes from the sp hybridized states .",
