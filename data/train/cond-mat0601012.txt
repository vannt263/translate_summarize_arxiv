    "<S> we study the pair correlation function @xmath0 for zero - temperature , disordered , soft - sphere packings just above the onset of jamming . we find distinct signatures of the transition in both the first and split second peaks of this function . </S>",
    "<S> as the transition is approached from the jammed side ( at higher packing fraction ) the first peak diverges and narrows on the small-@xmath1 side to a delta - function . on the high-@xmath1 side of this peak </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0 decays as a power - law . in the split </S>",
    "<S> second peak , the two subpeaks are both singular at the transition , with power - law behavior on their low-@xmath1 sides and step - function drop - offs on their high-@xmath1 sides . </S>",
    "<S> these singularities at the transition are reminiscent of empirical criteria that have previously been used to distinguish glassy structures from liquid ones .    </S>",
    "<S> it is only natural to suspect that the dramatic dynamical arrest that occurs as a liquid is cooled into a glass must be accompanied by a signature in the underlying atomic arrangements . </S>",
    "<S> however , the atomic configurations in the liquid and glass are strikingly similar to one another . over the years </S>",
    "<S> , the challenge to identify a subtle structural difference between the two states has led to the proposal of several empirical criteria @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we revisit an old idea , due to bernal @xcite , of using static sphere packings to gain insight into the structure of amorphous systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , with decreasing density , the structure of such packings changes distinctly as they unjam .    </S>",
    "<S> it is particularly revealing to study static packings of spheres interacting via a finite - ranged , purely - repulsive potential . </S>",
    "<S> there is a fundamental change in the mechanical properties in such systems , reminiscent of the glass transition @xcite , as the packing fraction @xmath2 is varied across a well - defined unjamming / jamming transition at @xmath3 , which was found to coincide with the value of random close packing @xmath4 @xcite . above @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> the system has nonzero static shear and bulk moduli , while below @xmath3 it costs no energy to shear or compress the system by an infinitesimal amount . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the unjamming transition in many ways resembles a critical point @xcite , with many quantities , including a diverging length scale , behaving as power - laws as the transition is approached from higher density . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the unjamming transition exhibits clearly identifiable structural signatures associated with diverging quantities , even though both the jammed and the unjammed states are disordered . </S>",
    "<S> these structural characteristics are echoed in some of the empirical criteria @xcite that have previously been proposed for the glass transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulations reported here are for monodisperse , soft spheres of diameter @xmath5 that interact through the potential @xmath6 , for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 when @xmath9 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 is the center - to - center separation between two particles , measured in units of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied both the harmonic , @xmath10 , and the hertzian , @xmath11 , cases . </S>",
    "<S> particles are defined to be in contact if they overlap . </S>",
    "<S> our three - dimensional systems consist of @xmath12 spheres in periodic , cubic , simulation cells . to enable a systematic study of the approach to the unjamming transition </S>",
    "<S> , we employ conjugate - gradient energy minimization @xcite to obtain @xmath13 configurations at various packing fractions @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we average over ensembles of configurations at the same distance from the transition point , _ i.e. , _ at the same values of @xmath14 , which is equivalent to averaging over systems with the same pressure @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> structural signatures of jamming are more evident @xcite in the pair correlation function , @xmath0 , than in the structure factor , @xmath15 , even though the two functions are simply related by a fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore focus on the structural characteristics that signal the approach of the zero - temperature transition from the jammed side , through a detailed analysis of @xmath0 computed with extraordinary resolution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study two features of @xmath0 that undergo dramatic changes at the unjamming transition : the first peak and the split second peak ( _ i .  </S>",
    "<S> e. _ , the two subpeaks that merge with increasing temperature to become the second peak in a typical dense liquid ) . a plot of @xmath0 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] above the jamming transition .     vs. @xmath1 at two extreme values of @xmath16 ( dotted line ) and @xmath17 ( solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of the first peak height is higher and its width narrower for the lower value of @xmath18 . for @xmath19 , </S>",
    "<S> the first peak maximum is approximately @xmath20 , far beyond the scale of the graph.,width=264 ] </S>"
