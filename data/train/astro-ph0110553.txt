    "cygnus x2 is a bright persistent low  mass x  ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "it consists of a neutron star , having the highest optically measured mass reported to date ( @xmath0 @xmath1 , casares , charles & kuulkers 1998 ) , orbiting the evolved , late  type companion v1341 cyg , with a period of @xmath2 days ( cowley , crampton & hutchings 1979 ; casares , charles & kuulkers 1998 ) .",
    "although cyg x2 is one of longest know and best studied lmxbs , a clear understanding of its behavior has not yet been obtained .",
    "cyg x2 is classified as a z - source due to its behavior when studied on an x - ray color - color diagram ( ccd ) .",
    "z - sources follow a one - dimensional trajectory in the two - dimensional ccd , tracing out a z shape as the source evolves between different spectral states .",
    "the parts of the z are referred to as the horizontal branch ( hb ) at the top of the z , the normal branch ( nb ) along the diagonal of the z , and the flaring branch ( fb ) at the base of the z. z - sources move continuously along the z - diagram and the position of the source within the z is believed , from simultaneous multi - band ( radio , uv , optical and x  ray ) observations ( hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ) , to be related to the mass accretion rate with accretion at a minimum at the left end of the hb and at a maximum at the right end of the fb .",
    "however , the behavior of z - sources is not described by a single parameter because , on time scale of weeks to months , the morphology and position of the z - track in the ccd vary .",
    "kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1996 ) described the phenomenology for cyg x2 in terms of three overall intensity levels ( high , medium , and low ) , with different morphology for the z track in the different intensity levels .",
    "z - sources , including cyg x2 , show complex x - ray spectrum , requiring a superposition of several spectral components .",
    "different composite models , including thermal bremsstrahlung together with blackbody radiation , two blackbodies , a power law plus thermal bremsstrahlung , a multi  temperature blackbody disk plus boundary layer blackbody , or a comptonized spectrum , have all been found to describe adequately the data . unfortunately , spectral modeling alone has not led to unique identification of the physical origin of the various spectral components .",
    "further observations relating the x - ray spectra to other other source parameters are required .",
    "z - sources also show rich x - ray timing power spectra including several components and varying with position in the ccd .",
    "cyg x2 shows quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) with frequency varying between @xmath3 hz and @xmath4 hz , present on the horizontal branch and on the upper part of the normal branch ( hbos ) , and high frequency qpos ( khz qpos ) , ranging between 300 hz and 900 hz have been detected on the hb ( wijnands et al .",
    "1998 ) . slower qpos with frequencies of 57 hz are observed on the lower part of the normal branch ( called nbos ) .",
    "sometime hbos are observed simultaneously with the nbos , indicating these qpos should be produced by different mechanisms .",
    "agreement is lacking on a unique model to explain the hbos , the nbos , or the khz qpos .",
    "correlations between the timing parameters and other source parameters may help limit the number of viable models for the qpos .    in this paper",
    ", we present joint timing and spectral observations of cygnus x1 obtained with rossixte and bepposax .",
    "the goal of our observations was to obtain simultaneous x - ray spectral and timing data for cyg x-2 in order to study correlations between the spectral and timing parameters .",
    "the observations and analysis are described in  2 .",
    "results on the color and intensity evolution are presented in  3 , on timing power spectra in  4 , and on energy spectra in  5 .",
    "the correlations between spectral and timing properties is described in  6 .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in  7 .",
    "on 2000 june 23 , we performed a joint observation of cyg x2 with the rossixte and bepposax satellites .",
    "the pointing was carried out between 2000 june 2 13:11 ut and june 3 17:23 ut , with rossixte ( bradt et al . 1993 ) and between 2000 june 2 18:56 ut and june 3 14:25 ut with the bepposax narrow field instruments , nfis ( boella et  al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "spectral data obtained from the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) in 129 photon energy channels with a time resolution of 16 s ( standard 2 ) were used to extract a color - color diagram ( ccd ) and a hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) .",
    "the soft and hard colors were defined as counts rate ratios between 4.06.4  kev and 2.64.0  kev and between 9.716  kev and 6.49.7  kev .",
    "the intensity was defined as the pcu2 count rates in the energy band 2.616  kev .",
    "all count rates were background subtracted .",
    "we used only pcu2 for the intensity and color analysis as only it and pcu0 were on during all observations and pcu0 suffered from a propane layer leak which made the energy calibration very uncertain .",
    "timing data obtained from the pca with a time resolution of 125  @xmath5 in single bit ( one energy channel ) modes for the energy bands 2.05.8  kev , 5.810.1  kev , 10.121.4  kev , and 21.4120  kev were used to obtain power spectra .",
    "we note that the data mode used does not allow us to remove events from pcu0 .",
    "thus , due to the propane layer leak , the true energy bands for pcu0 likely differ from these nominal ranges . however , our basic result on the energy dependent of the timing noise ( that the noise features are stronger at higher energies ) is not sensitive to the details of the energy band boundaries .    to search for fast khz qpos , we performed fast fourier transforms on 2  s segments , added all power spectra obtained within each selected observation interval , and then searched for excess power in the 2002048  hz range .",
    "no khz qpos with a chance probability of occurrence of less than @xmath6 were found either in the full band data or in the data above 5.8  kev .",
    "the khz qpo previously found from cyg x2 occurred in the medium overall intensity state ( wijnands et al.1998 ) .",
    "no khz qpos have been observed during the high intensity state .    to study the low frequency behavior , we performed fast fourier transforms on 64  s segments and we added the 64  s power spectra obtained for all or the three highest energy bands within each continuous observation interval . the expected poisson noise level , due to counting statistics , was estimated taking into account the effects of the deadtime and subtracted from each power spectrum , and the power spectra were normalized to fractional rms .",
    "each 0.1100  hz total power spectrum was fitted as described below .",
    "data from the bepposax nfis were used to extract broad band energy spectra .",
    "the nfis are four coaligned instruments covering the 0.1200  kev energy range : lecs ( 0.110  kev ) , mecs ( 1.310  kev ) , hpgspc ( 760  kev ) , and pds ( 13200  kev ) .",
    "the net on  source exposure times were 11  ks , 27  ks , 35  ks and 20  ks for lecs , mecs , hpgspc , and pds respectively .",
    "lecs and mecs data were extracted in circular regions centered on cyg x2 s position having radii of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the same circular regions in blank field data were used for the background subtraction .",
    "cyg x2 is sufficiently bright during this observation that the background subtraction does not affect the fits results .",
    "spectra accumulated from dark earth data and during off  source intervals were used for the background subtraction in the hpgspc and in the pds respectively .",
    "the lecs and mecs spectra have been rebinned to sample the instrument resolution with the same number of channels at all energies .",
    "logarithmic rebinning was used for the hpgspc and pds spectra .",
    "we investigated the source power and energy spectrum in different regions of the hid .",
    "energy spectra of each nfi were create over five different hid intervals where bepposax data were present .",
    "these spectra are indicated with e , f , c , b , a and reported in order of position along the z track in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the alphabetical order indicates the sequence in time ( see mecs light curve in figure 2 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the rxte asm light curve of cygnus x2 where the long  term x - ray variation is clearly visible .",
    "the time of the rxte / bepposax observation is indicated with an arrow on the right .",
    "the light curve around the observation ( see the inset in figure 1 ) shows complex time variability .",
    "the source was in the high overall intensity state ( kuulkers , van der klis & vaughan 1996 ) and during the observation moved along the three branches of the z pattern ( this is more evident in the hid than in the ccd ) .",
    "no x - ray bursts occurred during the observation .",
    "the rxte / bepposax light curves obtained in the entire energy range of the pcu2 and the various energy ranges of the nfis are shown in figure 2 , and figure 3 shows the color - color ( ccd ) and hardness - intensity ( hid ) diagrams .",
    "the bin size is 256 s. in figure 3 , each symbol indicates a different continuous segment in the light curve ( see upper panel ) .",
    "the states of z sources are typically described in terms of a horizontal branch ( hb ) , a normal branch ( nb ) , and a flaring branch ( fb ) , as described above .",
    "the hb consists of the points with high hardness and varying intensity in the hid , the nb has high intensity and varying hardness , and the fb has low hardness and varying intensity . as observed during other high intensity levels ( wijnands et al .",
    "97 , wijnands & van der klis 2001 ) the fb in hid is almost horizontal and the correlation of intensity with position along the z track reverses in the fb relative to the hb .",
    "we divided the data into seven states for use in the analysis below .",
    "four regions are in the hb ( marked as hb1 , hb2 , hb3 , hb4 on the hid ) one is in the nb ( nb1 ) , one region is at the nb / fb corner ( nbfb ) , and finally one is in the fb ( fb1 ) .",
    "the overall intensity of the source changes by more than a factor of 2 during the entire observation ( see the pcu2 light curve ) .",
    "the character of the intensity variations changes with energy . just after the beginning of the bepposax observation , near a time of @xmath9 and marked as nbfb in figure 2 , the source moved from the flaring branch ( fb ) to the normal branch ( nb ) and the counts rates increased by more than a factors of 5 in the 410  kev , 1015  kev , 1550  kev energy ranges but remained roughly constant in the 0.24  kev band .",
    "conversely , near a time of @xmath10 , and marked as hbnb in figure 2 , the source crossed the nb / hb corner and the count rates in the bands below 10  kev suffer large decreases , while the rate in the 1550  kev band remains decreases only slightly .",
    "to investigate the evolution of fast timing behavior with position in the hid , we created power spectra in 7 regions of the hid described above and shown in figure 3 .",
    "the resulting power spectra obtained from the full pca band are shown in figure 4 and power spectra obtained using events from the three higher energy single - bit channels , i.e. photons with energies above 5.8  kev , in figure  5 .",
    "at least five different power spectral components have been distinguished in the power spectra of cygnus x2 and other z sources ( hasinger and van der klis 1989 ) : 1 ) a power law which is referred to as very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) because it dominates below 0.1  hz ; 2 ) a broad noise component , referred as low frequency noise ( lfn ) , represented by a flat power law with a high frequency cutoff , which characterizes the hb power spectra up to around 10  hz ; 3 ) a broad noise component having a similar shape as lfn , but extending to 100  hz or above , known as high frequency noise ( hfn ) , present in all spectral states ; 4 ) a narrow excess with centroid frequency in the 1560  hz range , present in the hb , called the horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ) , and modeled with a lorentzian ; 5 ) another broad peak present in the nb , similar in shape to hbo , but with a characteristic frequency of around 6  hz , called the normal branch oscillation ( nbo ) .",
    "the solid curves in figures 5 and 6 represent analytic fits consisting of these components .",
    "the components used for each power spectrum and the fit parameters obtained are presented in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude for the vlfn component was found by integrating over the frequency range 0.0011  hz .",
    "a range of 0.01100  hz was used for both lfn and hfn components . because the hfn powerlaw index @xmath11 been found to be consistent with zero in z sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , we fixed it to zero .",
    "a strong narrow hbo is present at the left end of the hb ( hb1 ) .",
    "a faint and narrow feature was visible in the first three hb power spectra near the position of the second harmonic , and there is also a possible third harmonic in the hb1 power spectrum . moving along the hb towards the nb , the frequency increased from 28  hz to 50  hz , while its rms amplitude decreased from 2.8  @xmath12 to 1.7  @xmath12 ( for @xmath13  kev , the rms decreased from 4.3  @xmath12 to 2.4  @xmath12 ) , and its width increased from 6.7  hz to 16.5  hz .",
    "this behavior is consistent with that observed in the ginga data by wijnands et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "lfn and hfn can be identified in all 4 hb power spectra .",
    "the vlfn was not fitted separately from lfn because its power in the 0.1100 hz range was much smaller than that of lfn .",
    "the rms of the lfn was 45% ( 67% for @xmath14  kev ) and changed little along the hb .",
    "the powerlaw index @xmath15 and the cut  off frequency @xmath16 showed a positive correlation with the hbo frequency .",
    "the hfn component showed a cutoff frequency @xmath16 which is consistent with constant within the ( sometimes large ) errors , and a clear inverse correlation between its strength and the hbo frequency .    on the upper part of the nb ( nb1 )",
    ", the hbo is still visible at 54 hz with an rms level of 1.8% ( 3.1% for @xmath13  kev ) .",
    "in addition , a broad nbo is present at @xmath175  hz . the nbo feature is lost in the continuum as the source moved towards the fb . a very strong vlfn component ( rms up to @xmath18 )",
    "replaced the lfn in the continuum of the nb and fb power spectra .",
    "the vlfn became stronger moving from the nb to the fb , and the hfn showed the opposite trend .",
    "to investigate the spectral behavior versus the position on the z track , we created energy spectra in 5 regions of the hid described above .",
    "we fitted the x - ray continuum of cyg x2 with several two  component models . a blackbody or disk multicolor blackbody ( diskbb , mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) was used to model the soft component , and one of three thermal comptonization models , a power law with cutoff , or the solution of the kompaneets equation given by sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 compst or its improved version comptt ( in which relativistic effects are included , titarchuk 1994 ) , was used for the harder component .",
    "the addition of a gaussian around 1  kev was required in all intervals .",
    "lines near 1  kev have been observed previously from cyg x-2 with instruments with higher resolution ( vrtilek et al .",
    "we also included a gaussian near 6.7  kev to model possible fe emission lines .",
    "the best fit to the continuum of cyg x2 was obtained using a blackbody or a diskbb plus the comptt comptonization model ( thereafter we call bb+comptt and diskbb+comptt ) .    using the diskbb+comptt model ( table  4 , plots on the right in figure  7 ) adequate fits",
    "were obtained .",
    "there is a slight , but not statistically significant excess of counts at high energy in the e and f spectra .",
    "the parameters of the diskbb component varied significantly with position along the z track with the inner disk temperature , @xmath19 , changing from 0.79  kev to 1.07  kev , and the inner radius @xmath20 changing from 63  km to 47  km .",
    "strong correlations of the parameters of the comptt component , other than its flux , with position along the z track were not evident .",
    "the temperature and effective wien radius of the seed photons for the comptonized component were constant at @xmath21  kev and @xmath22 .",
    "the temperature of the comptonizing region was also roughly constant at @xmath23  kev , while the optical depth varied in the range @xmath24 .    with the bb+comptt model , an excess of counts above @xmath25  kev was apparent in all five spectra .",
    "because it is now known that a hard tail is sometimes present in the spectra of z sources , we added a powerlaw component to fit the hard tail .",
    "addition of the powerlaw is justified by the f - test statistic ( the probability that the improvement in @xmath26 is due to chance is always less than @xmath27 ) .",
    "this additional component was detected up to energies of @xmath28  kev , had a best fit photon index @xmath29 and contributed @xmath30 of the 0.1 - 100  kev source flux .",
    "hard tails have been reported in the spectra of z sources , including for gx  5 - 1 using ginga by ( asai et al .",
    "1994 ) , for cyg x-2 using bepposax ( frontera et  al .",
    "1998 ) , for sco x-1 using cgro / osse ( strickman & barret 2000 ) and using rxte / hexte ( damico et al .",
    "2001a ) , and for gx 17 + 2 ( di salvo et al .",
    "2000 ) , gx 349 + 2 ( di salvo et al .  2001 ) , and cir x-1 ( iaria et al .",
    "2001 ) using bepposax observations .",
    "the need for a hard powerlaw tail in the present data depend on the choice of the spectral model , and , thus , can not be considered a detection of the hard powerlaw tail .",
    "damico et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , taking into account all the results on the detections of hard x - ray tails in sco x-1 and gx 349 + 2 , argue that the appearance of a such component is correlated with the brightness of the thermal component .",
    "specifically , they propose that the production of a hard x - ray tail in a z source is a process triggered when the thermal component is brighter than a level of @xmath17 4@xmath31 10@xmath32 ergs s@xmath33 in the 2050 kev energy range . in this energy range , the luminosity of cyg x-2 , in the observation discussed here , was @xmath34 4.5 @xmath31 10@xmath32 ergs s@xmath33 , i.e.  very close to the trigger value .",
    "hence , our results appear consistent with previous observations . however , the fact that the hard powerlaw component is not required in the diskbb+comptt model underscores the importance of understanding the low energy emission in modeling the hard x - ray emission from x - ray binaries .",
    "results from these three - component fits to the bepposax spectra of cyg x2 are given in table  3 and in the plots on the left in figure  7 . because the powerlaw normalization , absorption column @xmath35 , and luminosity , obtained by fitting the e segment energy spectrum , were surprisingly higher than in other segments",
    ", we also report the fit parameters obtained by fixing the @xmath35 value to 2@xmath36 @xmath37 , close to the average value from the other observations .",
    "the blackbody flux is well correlated with position along the z track .",
    "the blackbody temperature and equivalent radius were approximately constant at @xmath38  kev and @xmath39  km ( using a distance of 11.6 kpc , casares et al .",
    "1999 ) , respectively .",
    "the temperature of the seed photons for the comptonized component was roughly constant at @xmath40  kev .",
    "following in t zand et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we derived an effective wien radius of the seed photons ; this was roughly constant at @xmath41  km .",
    "the temperature and optical depth of the ( spherical ) comptonizing region were @xmath23  kev and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the addition of an fe k@xmath43 line at @xmath44  kev proved necessary , especially when the source was in the hb ( spectra e and f ) .",
    "similar parameters for the line where found using both the bb+comptt and diskbb+comptt models .",
    "bepposax does not have adequate spectral resolution to draw detailed conclusions about the origin of this line ( piraino , santagelo , & kaaret 2000 ) , but the presence of the line is motivation for high resolution spectral studies of cyg x-2 while in the hb .",
    "to directly compare the spectral and timing properties of cyg x-2 , we performed a second timing analysis of the rxte data using regions of the z - diagram matching the regions selected for spectral analysis .",
    "the analysis was performed as described above . in figure 8",
    ", we plot the spectral parameters obtained for the comptonization and thermal components of the e , f , c , and b spectra for the two models discussed above versus the hbo frequency .",
    "the flux from the compton component appears correlated with hbo frequency for the bb+comptt model , but may not be for the diskbb+comptt model .",
    "the other comptonization parameters do not appear correlated with hbo frequency in either model .",
    "the total flux is clearly correlated with hbo frequency in both models .",
    "however , we note that these observations sample only a short time span and correlations between timing parameters and total flux are generally not robust over long intervals ( ford et al .",
    "interestingly , a strong correlation exists between the parameters of the soft spectral component , either the blackbody flux for the bb+comptt model or the disk inner radius for the diskbb+comptt model , and the hbo frequency .",
    "we discovered a correlation between the hbo frequency and the parameters of the soft thermal spectral component  the blackbody flux for the blackbody model and the disk inner radius for the multicolor disk blackbody model .",
    "this likely implies a physical relation between the source of the soft thermal emission and the timing frequencies .",
    "rxte and bepposax data from the atoll source 4u  0614 + 091 , covering a span of more than one year , showed a robust correlation between the khz qpo frequency and the flux of the blackbody component in data spanning several years ( ford et al .",
    "1997 ; piraino et  al .",
    "1999 ) . because the frequencies of the various timing signals from x - ray binaries appear to be highly correlated ( psaltis et al .",
    "1999 ) , the physical implications of the spectral - hbo correlation are likely to be similar to those of the spectral - khz qpo correlation .    a correlation would occur naturally in models where the oscillation frequencies are related to the keplerian orbital frequency , @xmath45 , at inner edge of the accretion disk , @xmath46 , ( e.g.  alpar & shaham 1985 , miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ; stella & vietri 1998 ) and the flux from the soft thermal component arises from an accretion disk ( the usual interpretation of the diskbb model ) .",
    "the keplerian relation , @xmath47 , would be expected if the oscillation frequency , @xmath48 , is linearly related to the keplerian orbital frequency , @xmath45 .",
    "we fitted a function of the form @xmath49 to the data with @xmath46 taken as the disk radius from the diskbb spectral component .",
    "the best fit exponent is @xmath50 which is consistent with the keplerian value @xmath51 . with @xmath52",
    "fixed to the keplerian value , the coefficient @xmath53 .",
    "this is consistent with a @xmath54 neutron star if @xmath55 .    in",
    "the ` magnetospheric beat  frequency model ' ( e.g. alpar & shaham 1985 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1999 ) the centroid frequency of the qpo is identified with the difference between the keplerian frequency at magnetospheric radius and the spin frequency , @xmath56 of the neutron star . if the inner disk radius is equal to the magnetospheric radius , then @xmath57 .",
    "fitting this form to the data , we find @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these values are inconsistent with a neutron star mass above @xmath60 .",
    "however , we note that @xmath46 may not reflect the true magnetospheric radius .",
    "the current data consist of only a few points , with significant errors on the derived spectral parameters for some of the points .",
    "hence , the data are not sufficient to adequately constrain the relation between the oscillation frequency and the spectral parameters so that strong conclusions about the viability of particular models can be drawn .",
    "additional observations with higher spectral resolution and better low energy response , made simultaneously with timing observations would be of great interest and might provide a means to discriminate between various models of the hbo .",
