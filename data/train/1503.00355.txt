    "it is enough to prove that @xmath0 contains elements of order @xmath335 .",
    "there are @xmath327 elements of order dividing @xmath327 and @xmath336 elements of order dividing @xmath336 , hence there are at least @xmath337 elements of order not dividing @xmath327 and not dividing @xmath336 , in other words there are at least @xmath337 elements of order divisible by @xmath335 , a suitable power of which has order @xmath335 .",
    "we only need to make sure that @xmath338 .",
    "we have @xmath339 .",
    "since the sylow subgroups of @xmath0 are central and cyclic , @xmath0 is cyclic .",
    "the proof is completed .",
    "let @xmath52 be a fixed positive integer . in this section",
    "we construct infinitely many finite groups @xmath0 with exactly @xmath340 cyclic subgroups .",
    "this is done by applying proposition [ subcont ] with @xmath341 , @xmath342 .",
    "let @xmath343 be positive integers with @xmath344 ( since @xmath345 , @xmath346 is even ) , @xmath347 odd and @xmath348 .",

    "[ subcont ] the number of cyclic subgroups of @xmath0 is @xmath353 .    for the record , @xmath354 where @xmath355 .",
    "we will first find the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form @xmath356 where @xmath357 divides @xmath347 and then we will look at the elements of the form @xmath358 .",
    "let @xmath359 and let @xmath357 be a divisor of @xmath347 .",
    "we compute @xmath360 .",
    "since @xmath347 is odd , @xmath357 is odd , hence @xmath361 hence @xmath362 .",
    "this implies that @xmath363 equals @xmath364 if @xmath2 is even and @xmath365 if @xmath2 is odd , implying that @xmath366 , which is divisible by @xmath367 .",
    "moreover clearly @xmath368 is determined by @xmath369 ( all the elements of @xmath369 outside @xmath232 are of the form @xmath365 ) and @xmath370 is determined by @xmath369 because @xmath371 .",
    "this means that different pairs @xmath372 give rise to distinct cyclic subgroups @xmath369",
    ". hence there are @xmath373 such subgroups .",
    "hence we have found @xmath373 cyclic subgroups of the form @xmath356 where @xmath357 is a divisor of @xmath347 ( so @xmath357 is odd ) .",

    "moreover the elements of @xmath0 of the form @xmath358 ( i.e. @xmath368 times an even power of @xmath6 ) verify @xmath378 hence their order divides @xmath379 , on the other hand there are exactly @xmath379 such elements hence they all belong to @xmath380 .",
    "this proves that @xmath380 is the only cyclic subgroup of @xmath0 of order @xmath379 .",
    "we have found @xmath381 cyclic subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "we have @xmath382 and @xmath383 , hence @xmath384 therefore all we are left to show is that the cyclic subgroups we listed are all the cyclic subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "we need to show that if @xmath385 is a cyclic subgroup of @xmath0 of order divisible by @xmath367 then @xmath385 is generated by an element of the form @xmath356 with @xmath357 a divisor of @xmath347 .",
    "say @xmath385 is generated by @xmath386 .",
    "then @xmath387 is odd , indeed if @xmath387 is even then @xmath368 and @xmath388 commute hence @xmath389 , contradicting the fact that @xmath390 is divisible by @xmath367 . now , similarly as above , @xmath386 has order @xmath391 where @xmath392 is an odd divisor of @xmath346 , that is , a divisor of @xmath347 . since @xmath393 there is some integer @xmath394 such that @xmath395 and @xmath394 is coprime to @xmath396 .",
