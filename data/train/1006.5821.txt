    "<S> the semileptonic charge asymmetry in @xmath0 decays is discussed in the context of general mssm with gluino - mediated flavor and cp violation in light of the recent measurements at the tevatron .    in this addendum to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we discuss the semileptonic charge asymmetry in the @xmath0 decays in general susy models with gluino - mediated flavor and cp violation , in light of the recent measurements of like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry by d  collaboration at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the model is described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , to which we refer for the details of the model and other phenomenological aspects related with @xmath1 mixing , the branching ratio of and cp asymmetry in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and cp asymmetry in @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> one can define the semileptonic charge asymmetry in the decay of @xmath5 mesons as @xmath6 for @xmath7 . in terms of the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian describing the damped oscillation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the asymmetry @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , this is another observable measuring @xmath13 violation in @xmath5@xmath14 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we take the approximation , @xmath15 , since the leading contribution comes from the absorptive part of the box diagrams for @xmath5@xmath14 mixing and there is no new common final state into which both @xmath5 and @xmath14 can decay in our scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the size of @xmath16 is fixed by the @xmath17 data up to hadronic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath10 can be regarded as a sine function of @xmath18 , multiplied by the factor @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this curve is traversed as one allows for arbitrary supersymmetric contributions to @xmath16 obeying the @xmath17 constraint . combining the sm predictions @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 one finds the vanishingly small asymmetry @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the d  collaboration reported a measurement of like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they interpreted the result as coming from the mixing of neutral @xmath22 mesons and have found an evidence for an anomaly in the asymmetry , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number of events where decays of two @xmath26 hadrons yield two positive and two negative muons , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their result shows a discrepancy of @xmath27 from the sm expectation . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry consists of @xmath28 coming from @xmath29 decays as well as @xmath30 from @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> one can extract the asymmetry relevant to the @xmath0 meson using the measured value of @xmath28 and the result by d  is @xmath31 this is @xmath32 away from the sm prediction . </S>",
    "<S> we shall use this data in the following discussion .    </S>",
    "<S> this d  result has drawn interest in new physics explanations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( for earlier works , see e.g.  refs .  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> some of the works consider extra contributions to @xmath33 since the dimuon charge asymmetry depends on it as well as on @xmath16 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach also has a possibility of altering @xmath34 even though its current experimental value is in agreement with the sm one , @xmath35 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we said , @xmath33 is fixed in the present work and we are left only with the option of modifying @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath34 shall become smaller than its sm prediction as @xmath37 grows up to @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform the numerical analysis in the same way as in the main article @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial ingredient for evaluating @xmath30 is the range of @xmath39 to be used . following the latest reports from d  @xcite and cdf @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , there have been a couple of attempts to make a global fit of @xmath0@xmath40  mixing parameters including @xmath39 @xcite . however , the official combination is not available yet . partly because of this reason and partly for the sake of coherent presentation , we keep using the range used in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath41 \\cup [ -2.77,-2.07 ] .\\ ] ] as a matter of fact , this range is not very different from the @xmath42 interval found in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as for @xmath43 , we take its central value from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : g12sm ] ) . considering </S>",
    "<S> the error in this ratio could add 20% more of uncertainty to the thickness of the @xmath30 band in the following figures .      </S>",
    "<S> +        we show @xmath30 as a function of @xmath39 for @xmath44 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asl tanb=03 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the four plots are for the @xmath45 , the @xmath46 , the @xmath47 , and the @xmath48 cases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> one can immediately notice the aforementioned sinusoidal dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath39 , coming from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : asl phis ] ) and the @xmath49 constraint . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is not only true of all the cases shown here but also of any new physics model that does not affect @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonzero thickness of the band arises from the uncertainty in @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath30 and its central value is at least about @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy becomes worse but only slightly after @xmath39 is restricted inside its preferred ranges ( colored in blue ) . if one incorporates the @xmath52 constraint , substantial part of the blue regions is excluded , in particular in the upper two cases with one insertion . </S>",
    "<S> even then , however , the lowest possible value of @xmath53 within the blue region does not change . in the lower two cases with two insertions </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath52 does not play an important role since the supersymmetric effect on @xmath0@xmath40  mixing is enhanced .      </S>",
    "<S> +        plots for @xmath54 are displayed in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asl tanb=10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the model - independent characteristics dictated by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : asl phis ] ) remain exactly the same as in the previous set of figures . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference is the stronger @xmath52 constraint due to higher @xmath55 . here </S>",
    "<S> , it excludes more part of the blue regions . </S>",
    "<S> again , this is particularly true of the upper two cases in which @xmath30 is restricted closer to its sm value . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asl tanb=10](a ) , @xmath49 , @xmath39 , and @xmath52 , together allow @xmath30 to be as low as @xmath56 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asl tanb=10](b ) , there is no solution satisfying all the three constraints . </S>",
    "<S> one could get @xmath57 if @xmath39 were not limited . in the lower two cases , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest @xmath30 , compatible with @xmath49 and @xmath39 , is almost the same as in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : asl tanb=03 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we summarize . </S>",
    "<S> we have examined how @xmath30 is influenced by the @xmath45 and/or @xmath46 mass insertions . for @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> , one can reduce the discrepancy between @xmath30 and its sm expectation from @xmath32 down to @xmath51 in each of the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 cases , obeying the @xmath49 , @xmath52 , and @xmath39 constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to reduction of the @xmath58 tension from @xmath27 down to @xmath59 if one assumes no new physics in the @xmath60 transition . for @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> , it becomes difficult for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 cases whereas the @xmath47 and @xmath48 cases are less limited by @xmath52 .    </S>",
