    "hierarchical structure formation models , such as @xmath5cdm , predict that large spiral galaxies like the milky way ( mw ) or andromeda ( m31 ) arise from successive mergers of small galaxies and from the smooth accretion of gas . at late times ,",
    "when a dominant central mass is in place , the main mode of mass acquisition is via the cannibalization of low mass satellites which fall into the gravitational potential well of the massive host .",
    "these @xmath5cdm models are highly successful at explaining observations on large scales . however , the models predict an overabundance of low - mass dark subhalos , which is inconsistent by 12 orders of magnitude with the number of observed dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "large uncertainties remain on the level of disagreement between model and observation because of the difficulty in constraining the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function ; the low surface brightnesses expected for the faintest galaxies ( @xmath6 ; e.g. , @xcite ) imply that ground - based surveys are likely incomplete even in nearby galaxy groups . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", star formation in low mass subsystems would have to be suppressed ( e.g. , photoionization in the early universe ) to bring models and observations into closer accord .",
    "the result of this hydro - dynamical modification would be a shallower faint - end slope for the @xmath7 galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a critical prediction of this solution is that dwarf galaxies should then be embedded in much larger , more massive dark subhalos @xcite .",
    "observational progress can be made in the case of the local group ( lg ) , where galaxies can be resolved into stars , thereby probing much fainter effective surface brightness limits @xcite .",
    "several recent and ongoing surveys are yielding exciting detections of low surface brightness features and new dwarf galaxy candidates around our nearest giant neighbour , m31 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "of particular interest is the system and  ix , which was first reported by the sloan digital sky survey team @xcite , and is readily visible in previously - published maps from the m31 int wide - field camera survey @xcite .",
    "andromeda ixis unique in that it is the lowest surface brightness galaxy found to date ( @xmath8 ) , and at the distance estimated from the position of the tip of the red giant branch ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) of @xmath12 @xcite , andromeda ix   would also be the faintest galaxy known ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is therefore an extremely important target for further study , with the potential to place strong constraints on both the lg luminosity function and the physics of galaxy formation at the smallest scales . in this letter , we present the results of a kinematic survey of the andromeda ix  dwarf spheroidal satellite of m31 .",
    "we have assumed for this paper a distance to m31 of @xmath13kpc ( @xmath14 ; @xcite ) .",
    "andromeda ix  reveals itself in the int wfc survey data as an enhancement of metal poor rgb stars at a location of @xmath15 to the e and @xmath16 to the n of the nucleus of m31 .",
    "figure  1 shows a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) centered on andromeda ix   and a nearby comparison region of equivalent area . the excess red giant branch ( rgb ) stars on the blueward side of the general m31 rgb locus form a well - defined andromeda ix   locus with an apparent rgb tip at @xmath17 consistent with the distance of m31 , and",
    "if representative of an old stellar population , @xmath18   \\sim -1.5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this metallicity value could be a slight overestimate given the presence of contaminating stars from the halo of m31 ; indeed the deeper study by @xcite found that the andromeda ix  population is more metal - poor ( @xmath18 \\sim -2.0 $ ] ) .    although sparsely populated , the radial profile , computed as the median counts in circular annuli centered on @xmath19 , is well defined and is shown background - corrected in the right - hand panel of figure  2 .",
    "exponential and plummer - law profiles provide adequate fits , with the scale radius from the exponential fit being @xmath20  ( corresponding to @xmath21 ; half - light radius @xmath22 ) , a value comparable to the other andromedan dsph companions @xcite .",
    "the error estimates include the uncertainty in the background subtraction .",
    "the luminosity of the dwarf galaxy is constrained by measuring the integrated flux , or surface brightness , distribution .",
    "the processing procedure @xcite is relatively straightforward : first the existing derived object catalogues are used to define a `` bright '' foreground star component , one magnitude above the rgb tip ( to allow for potential agb stars ) ; a circular aperture is excised around each foreground star and the flux within set to the local sky level interpolated from a whole - frame background map ( the size of the aperture is the maximum of 4 times the catalog - recorded area at the detection isophote or a diameter 4 times the derived fwhm seeing ) ; each frame is then rebinned on a @xmath23 grid to effectively create @xmath24 pixels ; the binned image is then further smoothed using a 2d gaussian filter of fwhm @xmath25 .",
    "the result of this is to produce a coarsely - sampled smooth image containing both the resolved and unresolved light contribution from the dwarf .",
    "elliptical apertures centered on the dwarf are then placed over the mosaic .",
    "the background is determined by robustly fitting a smoothly - varying surface over the whole mosaic area .",
    "the central surface brightness can then be trivally measured by deriving the radial profile , defined as the background - corrected median flux value within elliptical annuli .",
    "the variation in the flux from the multiple background measures gives a good indication of the flux error , which is , of course , dominated by systematic fluctuations rather than by random noise .",
    "since the systematics are dominated by random residual foreground star halos and scattered light from bright stars , possibly just outside the field - of - view , we chose to mitigate the effect by defining the size of the elliptical aperture to be equivalent to the geometric half - light radius derived from the number density profile .",
    "the estimated total flux is then scaled to allow for this correction . in this way we derive @xmath26 ( corrected for extinction ) , in agreement with the estimate of @xmath0 from @xcite ; and measure a central surface brightness @xmath27 .",
    "spectra for andromeda ix  were obtained with the deimos spectrograph on the keck2 telescope on the night of sept .",
    "13 , 2004 , under photometric conditions and seeing from 0.50.8 .",
    "we employed the 1200  @xmath28 grating covering the wavelength range 64009000 , with a spectral resolution of @xmath291.5 .",
    "the observations pioneered a new approach with deimos : using a ` fibre - hole ' 0.7@xmath30 slitlet approach packing @xmath29600 holes per mask .    for the andromeda ix  field",
    ", we constructed a ` fibre - hole ' mask with 623 holes assigned within the @xmath31 deimos field .",
    "this ` fibre - hole ' approach adopted in sept .",
    "2004 proved to be very successful , giving poisson - limited sky - subtraction ( down to @xmath32 ) by assigning holes to monitor the sky spectrum .",
    "stars were selected for observation primarily within a color - magnitude box designed to choose red - giant branch stars from the 5   region surrounding andromeda ix .",
    "this color - magnitude selection box is displayed in figure  1 .",
    "we then let the deimos configuration program randomly choose objects as fillers with i - band magnitudes between @xmath33 and colors @xmath34 .",
    "both metal - poor and metal - rich populations will be present in this selection .",
    "the fiber - hole diameters were milled at @xmath35  to match the median seeing .",
    "a total of 289 stars and 334 sky slits were assigned in this low - density field in the m31 outer halo .",
    "the andromeda ix  mask was observed for three integrations of 20min each , nodding to blank sky for 5min between each exposure to ensure that an adequate sky model could be constructed .",
    "the spectroscopic images were processed and combined using the pipeline software developed by our group .",
    "this software debiasses , performs a flat - field , extracts , wavelength - calibrates and sky - subtracts the spectra .",
    "the radial velocities of the stars were then measured with respect to a gaussian model of the caii triplet lines ( similar to the technique of @xcite ) . by fitting the three ca triplet lines separately ,",
    "an estimate of the radial velocity accuracy was obtained for each radial velocity measurement .",
    "the measurements have typical uncertainties of @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "a sample of 138 stars yielded a continuum s / n@xmath3810 and cross - correlations with velocity uncertainties of less than @xmath39 , and we include only these stars in the subsequent analysis ; 18 of these 138 stars lie in the andromeda ix  color selection window .",
    "the measured radial velocities in the andromeda ix  field are shown in figure  3 as a function of radial distance from the galaxy , where filled circles show the color - selected stars , while open circles are stars outside the cmd selection box .",
    "a strong foreground galactic component is present at heliocentric velocities @xmath40 , though as we show in a companion paper @xcite , below this velocity the galactic contamination is small .",
    "close to the center of andromeda ixthere is a small but clear kinematic grouping of stars which also lie on the andromeda ix  rgb .",
    "we first define an inner sample to be the 5 stars observed within a radius of one exponential scale - length ( @xmath41 ) ; this sample has mean of @xmath42 and an r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of @xmath43 , which is tiny compared to the huge velocity spread of stars beyond @xmath44 , indicating that the sample is highly unlikely to be contaminated .",
    "indeed , outside of a radius of @xmath45 not a single rgb - selected star is found within @xmath46 of this mean .",
    "an inspection of figure  3 shows that all stars within the rgb selection box in a radius of @xmath45 have radial velocities close to the mean of the inner sample .",
    "a fit of a maximum - likelihood gaussian model given these data ( and their uncertainties ) , is shown on the left - hand panel of figure  4 ( thin black lines ) , where we display the likelihood contours as a function of mean velocity and velocity dispersion .",
    "the most likely values are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , a single star at @xmath49 stands out in this sample of 11 objects as it is offset by @xmath50 from the mean velocity of the inner sample .",
    "since this object is potentially a contaminant , it is important to make an estimate of the expected contribution from m31 in the larger @xmath45 sample .",
    "we find that the halo in our kinematic survey of m31 , as seen through windows not affected by the m31 disk or by galactic stars @xcite , can be approximated to first order with a gaussian distribution of dispersion @xmath51 , centered at a mean velocity of @xmath52 .",
    "we use the rgb - selected stars at radii larger than @xmath45 and with velocities @xmath53 ( there are two such stars ) to normalise this simple halo model in the present field .",
    "a crude estimate of the expected contamination within a velocity interval of @xmath54 of the mean velocity of the inner sample can then be made . in this way we estimate that @xmath55 stars contaminate the sample within @xmath45 , though the uncertainties on this estimate are clearly very large .",
    "there is therefore some grounds to reject the velocity outlier at @xmath49 .",
    "rejecting that star in the maximum - likelihood gaussian fit results in the thick - lined likelihood contours shown in figure  4 ; the fit has a mean velocity and velocity dispersion of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the lower panel of figure  3 shows the maximum - likelihood velocity dispersion measures , starting at the radius of the inner @xmath58 sample , and moving outwards to @xmath45 adding one datum at a time .",
    "for the case of the thick - lined distribution we have rejected the velocity outlier at @xmath49 . evidently , the first 5 velocity data are consistent with being drawn from a population with zero intrinsic velocity dispersion , though beyond @xmath59 the dispersion appears to increase to @xmath60 . we note in passing that the present dataset shows no clear radial velocity gradient .",
    "the ( maximum - likelihood fitted ) mean velocity of the 5 inner stars within @xmath58 is @xmath61 , while the mean velocity of the sample of 5 stars between @xmath58 and @xmath45 ( with the outlier rejected ) is @xmath62 , so the velocity difference between the two samples is less than @xmath63 .",
    "the spectra also allow a measurement of the metallicity of the dwarf galaxy using the cat equivalent width ( ew ) technique . while the s / n of individual stars are typically too low to yield useful estimates of the cat ews , we proceeded to measure the average metallicity by stacking the rgb star spectra of the 5 highest s / n stars of our sample of 10 stars within @xmath64 .",
    "we follow as closely as possible the method of @xcite , fitting moffat functions to the caii lines .",
    "the average spectrum yields a measurement of the cat equivalent width used to estimate the metallicity as @xmath18 =   -2.66   + 0.42 [ \\sigma   ca   -   0.64 ( v_{hb }   -   v_{ave})]$ ] , with @xmath65 , @xmath66 being a surface gravity correction relative to the @xmath2 magnitude of the horizontal branch , and @xmath67 the average magnitude of the andromeda ix   stars .",
    "we correct the value of @xmath68 for m31 , measured by @xcite , by -0.06  mags to account for the difference in line of sight distance between m31 and andromeda ix .",
    "we find @xmath18=-1.5 $ ] ( on the @xcite scale ) , with a large uncertainty of @xmath69  mags which is due primarily to sky - subtraction residuals making it difficult to define the continuum level of the spectrum .",
    "this metallicity estimate confirms the previous photometric estimates of @xmath18    \\sim    -1.5 $ ] by @xcite and of @xmath18 \\sim -2 $ ] by @xcite .",
    "a metallicity of @xmath18 \\sim -2 $ ] would be closer to what we would expect for such a faint dsph , however if the mass were as large as suggested by the upper range of our kinematic analysis , a metallicity of @xmath18 \\sim -1.5 $ ] would be reasonable .",
    "the mean radial velocity that we measure ( @xmath70 ) implies that andromeda ix  is almost certainly a bound satellite to m31 .",
    "the relative radial velocity from m31 is then only ( @xmath71 ) , while its separation from the m31 center is only @xmath72 . in the model of @xcite , the escape velocity from @xmath73 is @xmath74",
    "; if the velocity vector of andromeda ix   is uncorrelated with the direction vector to the observer , the chances of measuring a line of sight component of only @xmath75 if andromeda ix  is unbound would be @xmath76% ( although uncertainty in the line of sight distance could slightly increase the probability ) .",
    "andromeda ix   is therefore most likely bound to m31 .",
    "the measured velocity dispersion also allows us to constrain the dark matter content of the small galaxy , if we assume virial equilibrium .",
    "the mass to light ratio of a simple spherically symmetric stellar system of central surface brightness @xmath77 , half brightness radius @xmath78 , and central velocity dispersion @xmath79 can be estimated as : @xmath80 @xcite , where @xmath81 is a dimensionless parameter which has a value close to unity for many structural models .    for our sample of stars within @xmath45 ,",
    "the measured velocity dispersion is not necessarily representative of the central value of @xmath79 .",
    "however , for most models of bound stellar systems like those assumed in the core - fitting method , the velocity dispersion decreases with distance , so that our measured dispersion will be an underestimate of @xmath79 if andromeda ix  conforms to these models . assuming that @xmath82 , we show the relative likelihood of @xmath83 values for our sample selections on the right - hand panel of figure  4 , where we have folded in the uncertainties in the half - light radius , the velocity dispersion and the central surface brightness . for the @xmath45 sample with the rejected velocity outlier",
    ", we find that the measured kinematics imply that andromeda ix   has a mass to light ratio @xmath84 ( thick black line ) .",
    "in particular , with this sample we can reject the possibility that andromeda ix   has @xmath85 with 99% confidence .",
    "however , this measurement depends very sensitively on our adopted sample ; if we do not reject the single most discrepant velocity datum we find a higher preferred m / l value ( thin black line ) , while if we choose the inner 5 stars alone ( red lines ) , the mass can be consistent with zero .",
    "the spectroscopic data we have presented here have allowed us to make a preliminary assessment of the mass and nature of this intriguing dwarf galaxy . while andromeda ix   appears to be the lowest surface brightness galaxy found to date @xcite , and also the faintest galaxy known , our preferred mass estimate ( @xmath86 ) implies a substantial dark matter component with a mass - to - light ratio @xmath87 . for comparison , applying the same procedure above to the case of the draco dsph , the most dark matter dominated of the milky way satellites , which has @xmath88 @xcite , @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "@xcite gives @xmath91 ( though more detailed dynamical modelling suggests @xmath92 - @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that this analysis assumes a gaussian distribution , while there are probably too few andromeda ix  data points to support this assumption .",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility that tidal effects have enhanced the extent and velocity dispersion of this satellite , yielding a misleadingly high mass to light ratio estimate , andromeda ixappears to be a highly dark matter dominated dsph .",
    "it therefore presents an intriguing possibility for hierarchical cold dark matter models of structure formation  that many dark matter dominated dsphs , fainter even than andromeda ix , and lying just below the limits of detectability , may be present in the halos of giant galaxies like m31 , bringing models ( e.g. , @xcite ) into better accord with data .",
    "nevertheless , given the small size of our sample of stars further accurate kinematic data are needed to confirm the velocity dispersion measurement , while deep photometry will help ascertain the extent to which tidal forces may be perturbing the system .",
