    "at hadron colliders , the top quarks ( @xmath1 ) are predominantly produced in pairs via the strong interaction process @xmath2 . though it is possible to study the decay branching ratios of the top quark in @xmath3 pairs , to test the coupling of top quark with bottom quark ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 gauge boson in hadron collisions , it is best to study the single - top quark production . compared to the top quark pair production , produced by the interaction of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the single top quark productions are through the electroweak interaction connecting top quark to the down - type quarks , with amplitudes proportional to the cabibbo - kabayaashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "due to the nature of left - handed charged weak current interaction , the top quark produced via single - top processes is highly polarized .",
    "furthermore , top quark will decay via weak interaction before it has a chance to form a hadron , so its polarization property can be studied from the angular distributions of its decay particles .",
    "hence , measuring the production rate of the single - top event can directly probe the electroweak properties of the top quark .",
    "for example , it can be used to measure the ckm matrix element @xmath6 and to test the @xmath7 structure of the top quark charged - current weak interaction , or to probe cp violation effects  @xcite .",
    "besides of playing the role as a test of the standard model ( sm ) , the precision measurement of the single top quark events has additional importance in searching for new physics , because the charged - current top quark coupling ( @xmath5-@xmath1-@xmath4 ) might be particularly sensitive to certain new physics via new weak interactions or via loop effects , and new production mechanism might also contribute to the single top event rate  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the single - top event is also an important background to the search of higgs boson ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) at the tevatron  @xcite and other new physics search  @xcite .",
    "because of the unique features of the single top quark physics , it has been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "there are three separate single top quark production processes of interest at the hadron collider , which may be characterized by the virtuality of the @xmath5 boson ( with four momentum @xmath10 ) in the processes .",
    "the s - channel process @xmath11 via a virtual s - channel @xmath5 boson involves a timelike @xmath5 boson , @xmath12 , the t - channel process @xmath13 ( including @xmath14 , also referred as @xmath5-gluon fusion ) involves a spacelike @xmath5 boson , @xmath15 , and the @xmath16 associated production process @xmath17 involves an on - shell @xmath5 boson , @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , these three single top quark production mechanisms probe the charged - current interaction in different @xmath19 regions and are thus complementary to each other .",
    "furthermore , they are sensitive to different new physics effects  @xcite , and should be separately studied .    to improve the theoretical prediction on the single - top production rate , a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) correction , at the order of @xmath20 , for",
    "the s- and t - channel processes has been carried out in refs .",
    "this is similar to the study of the @xmath21 correction to the top quark decay  @xcite .",
    "although the above studies provide the inclusive rate for single - top production , they can not predict the event topology of the single - top event , which is crucial to confront the theory with experimental data in which some kinematical cuts are necessary to detect such an event . for that , refs .",
    "@xcite have calculated the differential cross section for on - shell single top quark production .",
    "however , nlo corrections to the top quark decay process were not included , nor the effects of the top quark width were considered . since the top quark production and decay do not occur in isolation from each other , a theoretical study that includes both kinds of corrections is needed",
    ". a complete nlo calculation should include contribution from the production and the decay of the top quark , and the angular correlation among the final state particles should be calculated to analyze the polarization of the top quark .",
    "the @xmath21 corrections to kinematic distributions may depend on the kinematic cuts and on the jet algorithm that must be implemented in the experiments .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to obtain a fully differential calculation that can be used to study the kinematics of the final state particles .    in this theory paper",
    ", we present a nlo qcd calculation with the one - scale phase space slicing method , which treats consistently @xmath21 corrections to both the production and the decay of the top quark in single top events .",
    "our approach can give not only the inclusive total cross section , but also the various kinematical distributions of the final state particles , and provide a study on the top quark polarization at the nlo .",
    "furthermore , since realistic kinematical cuts can be applied , our approach allows the experimentalists to compare their results directly with the theoretical predictions . in our study",
    ", we assume in all cases leptonic decays of the @xmath5 boson ( for the sake of definiteness , we shall consider @xmath22 ; the lepton mass effects will be neglected throughout this paper ) .",
    "the phenomenological discussions will be given in our sequential papers  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we outline the method of our calculation . in sec .",

    ", we present the nlo helicity amplitudes of the production and decay of single top quark .",
    "the effective form factor approach is adopted in the calculation to generalize the application of our formalism to , for example , studying new physics effects . in sec .",
    "v , we use the phase space slicing ( pss ) method to calculate the effective form factors . to regularize divergencies in the calculation that involves the @xmath23 matrix , both the dimensional regularization ( dreg )  @xcite and the dimensional reduction ( dred )  @xcite schemes",
    "are examined and their difference is shown in each individual form factor . in sec .",
    "vi , we show how to assemble all the components discussed above to enumerate the nlo differential cross section of the single top quark .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section we outline the method of our calculation whose details shall be presented in the following sections .      in this work , the narrow width approximation ( nwa )",
    "is used to study the production and decay of single top quark , in which the @xmath21 corrections can be unambiguously assigned to either the single top quark production process or the top quark decay process .",
    "a finite top width will result in a new type of virtual nlo feynman diagram in which a gluon line is connected from the anti - bottom quark ( of the production process ) to the bottom quark ( of the decay process )",
    ". moreover , there will also be interference between the gluons emitted in the production and the gluon emitted in the decay if the effects of finite top quark width is considered .",
    "those effects are nonfactorizable , which are similar to the effects of qed radiative corrections to the scattering process @xmath24 .",
    "it was shown that the nonfactorizable effects are small as long as the process is not near the threshold  @xcite .",
    "this provides the motivation of using the nwa for this kind of calculation  @xcite .",
    "the single top quark can be produced through s - channel and t - channel processes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwa - lo](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : nwa - lo](b ) , respectively . using the nwa",
    ", we decompose the born level processes , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nwa - lo ] as indicated by symbol @xmath25 , into two parts : the top quark production and its sequential decay , where both the production and decay matrices are separately gauge invariant . making use of the polarization information of the top quark",
    ", we can apply the nwa to correlate the top quark production with the top quark decay processes by replacing the numerator of the top quark propagator ( @xmath26 ) by @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the dirac spinor of the top quark with helicity @xmath29 , where @xmath30 or @xmath31 for a right - handed or left - handed top quark , respectively .",
    "therefore , the scattering amplitude of the single top quark production and decay processes can be written as  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the helicity amplitude and @xmath29 is the helicity eigenvalue of the single top quark produced in the intermediate state .",
    "the matrix element squared can be written as the product of the production part and the decay part in the density matrix formalism : @xmath34 where @xmath35 in addition to the matrix elements , the phase space of the single top quark processes can also be factorized into the top quark production and decay for an on - shell top quark in nwa by writing the denominator of the top quark propagator as@xmath36 when the matrix element is calculated using the fixed @xmath37 value , it is the usual nwa method . in this case , the invariant mass of the top quark decay particles will be equal to @xmath37 ( a fixed value ) for all events .",
    "reconstructing the top quark invariant mass from its decay particles is an important experimental task at the tevatron and the lhc , it is desirable to have a theory calculation that would produce the invariant mass distribution of the reconstructed top quark mass with a breit - wigner resonance shape to reflect the non - vanishing decay width of the top quark ( for being an unstable resonance ) .",
    "for that , we introduce the `` modified nwa '' method in our numerical calculation in which we generate a breit - wigner distribution for the top quark invariant mass in the phase space generator and then calculate the squared matrix element according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : density - matrix ] ) with @xmath37 being the invariant mass generated by the phase space generator on the event - by - event basis . in the limit",
    "that the total decay width of the top quark approaches to zero ( i.e. , much smaller than the top quark mass ) , the production and the decay of top quark can be factorized . therefore ,",
    "the s - matrix element for the production and the decay processes are separately gauge invariant with any value of top quark invariant mass .",
    "we find that the total event rate and the distributions of various kinematics variables ( except the distribution of the reconstructed top quark invariant mass ) calculated using the `` modified nwa '' method agree well with that using the nwa method . in the nwa method ,",
    "the reconstructed top quark invariant mass distribution is a delta - function , i.e. , taking a fixed value , while in the `` modified nwa '' method , it is almost a breit - wigner distribution .",
    "the reason that the `` modified nwa '' method does not generate a perfect breit - wigner shape in the distribution of the top quark invariant mass is because the initial state parton luminosities ( predominantly due to valence quarks ) for the s - channel single - top process drop rapidly at the relevant bjorken-@xmath38 range , where @xmath39 .",
    "when calculating nlo qcd corrections , one generally encounters both ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) ( soft and collinear ) divergencies . the former divergencies can be removed by proper renormalization of couplings and wave functions . we do nt need to renormalize the couplings in our calculation because the born level couplings do not involve qcd interaction . in order to handle the latter divergencies",
    ", one has to consider both virtual and real corrections .",
    "the soft divergencies will cancel according to the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg ( kln ) theorem  @xcite , but some collinear divergencies will remain uncanceled . in the case of considering the initial state partons , one needs to absorb additional collinear divergencies to define the nlo parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the initial state partons .",
    "after that , all the infrared - safe observables will be free of any singularities . to calculate the inclusive production rate",
    ", one can use the dimensional regularization scheme to regularize divergencies and adopt the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath40 ) factorization scheme to obtain the total rate .",
    "however , owing to the complicated phase space for multi - parton configurations , analytic calculations are in practice impossible for all but the simplest quantities . during the last few years , effective numerical computational techniques have been developed to calculate the fully differential cross section to nlo and above .",
    "there are , broadly speaking , two types of algorithm used for nlo calculations : the phase space slicing method , and the dipole subtraction method  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we use the phase space slicing method ( pss ) with one cutoff scale for which the universal crossing functions have been derived in ref .",
    "the advantage of this method is that , after calculating the effective matrix elements with all the partons in the final state , we can use the generalized crossing property of the nlo matrix elements to calculate the corresponding s - channel or t - channel matrix elements numerically without requiring any further effort .",
    "the validity of this method is due to the property that both the phase space and matrix element of the initial and final state collinear radiation processes can be simultaneously factorized .",
    "below , we briefly review the general formalism of the nlo calculation in pss method with one cutoff scale .",
    "the phase space slicing method with one cutoff scale introduces an unphysical parameter @xmath41 to separate the real emission correction phase space into two regions : ( 1 ) the resolved region in which the amplitude has no divergencies and can be integrated numerically by monte carlo method ; ( 2 ) the unresolved region in which the amplitude contains all the soft and collinear divergencies and can be integrated out analytically .",
    "it should be emphasized that the notion of resolved / unresolved partons is unrelated to the physical jet resolution criterium or to any other relevant physical scale . in the massless case ,",
    "a convenient definition of the resolved region is given by the requirement @xmath42 for all invariants @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the 4-momenta of partons @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "for the massive quarks , we follow the definition in ref .",
    "@xcite to account for masses , but still use the terminology `` resolved '' and `` unresolved '' partons . in the regions with unresolved partons ,",
    "soft and collinear approximations of the matrix elements , which hold exactly in the limit @xmath48 , are used .",
    "the necessary integrations over the soft and collinear regions of phase space can then be carried out analytically in @xmath49 space - time dimensions .",
    "one can thus isolate all the poles in @xmath50 and perform the cancellation of the ir singularities between the real and virtual contributions and absorb the leftover singularities into the parton structure functions via the factorization procedure . after the above procedure",
    ", one takes the limit @xmath51 .",
    "the contribution from the sum of virtual and unresolved region corrections is finite but @xmath41 dependent .",
    "since the parameter @xmath41 is introduced in the theoretical calculation for technical reasons only and is unrelated to any physical quantity , the sum of all contributions ( virtual , unresolved and resolved corrections ) must not depend on @xmath41 .",
    "we note that the phase space slicing method is only valid in the limit that @xmath52 is small enough so that a given jet finding algorithm ( or any infrared - safe observable ) can be consistently defined even after including the experimental cuts .",
    "in general , the conventional calculation of the nlo differential cross section for a process with initial state hadrons @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath4 denote parton flavors and @xmath57 , @xmath58 are parton momentum fractions .",
    "@xmath59 is the usual nlo parton distribution function with the mass factorization scale @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the nlo hard scattering differential cross section with the renormalization scale @xmath62 .",
    "the diagrammatic demonstration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conventional_nlo ] ) is shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] .",
    "unlike the conventional calculation method , the pss method with one cutoff scale will first cross the initial state partons into the final state , including the virtual corrections and unresolved real emission corrections .",
    "for example , to calculate the s - channel single top quark production at the nlo , we first calculate the radiative corrections to @xmath63 , as shown in the lower part of the fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] , in which we split the phase space of the real emission corrections into the unresolved and resolved region .",
    "after we integrate out the unresolved phase space region , the net contribution of the virtual corrections and the real emission corrections in the unresolved phase space is finite but theoretical cutoff ( @xmath41 ) dependent , and it can be written as a form factor ( denoted by the box in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] ) of the born level vertex .",
    "secondly , we take the already calculated effective matrix elements with all the partons in the final state and use the universal `` crossing function '' , which is the generalization of the crossing property of the lo matrix elements to nlo , to calculate the corresponding matrix elements numerically .",
    "once we cross the needed partons back to the initial state , the contributions from the unresolved collinear phase space regions are different from those with all the partons in the final state .",
    "these differences are included into the definition of the crossing function ( including the mass factorization effects ) , as shown in the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] . in this paper",
    ", we only present the explicit expressions of the crossing function . for the definition and detailed derivation of the crossing function , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite . after applying the mass factorization in a chosen scheme , the @xmath41 dependent crossing functions for an initial state parton @xmath56 , which participates in the hard scattering processes ,",
