    "form a great variety large - scale networks . therefore",
    ", modeling of brain s key functional properties is associated with study of collective activity of complex neurobiological networks .",
    "dynamical modeling approach @xcite is effective tool for the analysis of this kind of networks .",
    "first of all this approach takes building dynamical models of single neurons . on the one hand",
    ", such models should describe large quantity of various dynamical modes of neural activity ( excitable , oscillatory , spiking , bursting , etc . ) .",
    "this complexity is associated with the large number of voltage - gated ion channels of neurons .",
    "it takes employment of complex nonlinear dynamical systems given by differential equations .",
    "the canonical representative of this type of models is hodgkin - huxley system .",
    "it describes dynamics of the transport through membrane of neuron in detail . on the other hand , to model neural network consisting of the large number of interconnected units it is necessary to create simplified models for single neuron to avoid problems that are induced by high dimension and nonlinearity .",
    "for example , one which is commonly used in simulations is integrate - and - fire model @xcite .",
    "it represents one - dimensional nonlinear equation with some threshold rule .",
    "that is , if the variable of the model crosses a critical value , then it is reset to new value and the neuron is said to have fired . to solve the contradiction between the requirements of complexity and simplicity of neuron models phenomenological models were introduced .",
    "they describe basic properties of neuron dynamics , but these models do not take into account the large number of voltage - gated ion channels of neurons . as a rule they involve generalized variable which mimic the dynamic of some number of ionic currents at the same time .",
    "the examples of this type models are fitzhugh - nagumo @xcite , hindmarsh - rose @xcite , morris - lecar @xcite .",
    "they have the form of differential equations systems .",
    "however , there is another class of phenomenological models of the neural activity .",
    "these are discrete - time models in form of point maps . in the last decade",
    "this kind of neural models has attracted much attention@xcite .",
    "for example using a map - based approach rulkov et .",
    "@xcite have studied dynamics of one- and -two dimensional large - scale cortical networks .",
    "it has been found that such map - based models produce spatiotemoral regimes similar to those exhibited by hodgkin - huxley -like models .",
    "neuron oscillatory activity can take a variety of forms @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting oscillatory regimes is spiking - bursting oscillations regime , which is commonly observed in a wide variety of neurons such as hippocampal pyramidal neurons , thalamic neurons , pyloric dilator neurons etc .",
    "a burst is a series of three or more action potential usually riding on a depolarizing wave .",
    "it is believed that the bursting oscillations play crucial role in informational transmitting and processing in neurons , facilitate secretion of hormones and drive a muscle contraction .",
    "this oscillation can be regular or chaotic depending on the concentration of neuromodulators , currents and other control parameters .",
    "another interesting oscillatory regime is an oscillation of membrane potential below the excitation threshold , so - called subthreshold oscillation .",
    "for example , these oscillations with close to 10 hz frequency are observed in olivo - cerebellar system providing highly coordinated signals concerned with the temporal organization of movement execution @xcite ( see more discussion in the conclusion ) .",
    "the best known spiking - bursting activity model is the hindmarsh - rose system @xcite .",
    "it is three - dimensional ode - based system involving two nonlinear functions .",
    "spiking - bursting dynamics of map - based models has recently been investigated by cazelles et.al @xcite , rulkov @xcite , shilnikov and rulkov @xcite , tanaka @xcite .",
    "a piecewise linear two - dimensional map with a fast - slow dynamics was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that depending on the connection ( diffusively or reciprocally synoptically ) , the model demonstrates several modes of cooperative dynamics , among them phase synchronization .",
    "two dimensional map is used for modeling of spiking - bursting neural behavior of neuron @xcite .",
    "this map contains one fast and one slow variable .",
    "the map is piecewise nonlinear and has two lines of discontinuity on the phase plane .",
    "modification of this model is presented in @xcite .",
    "the further advancement of rulkov model is presented in @xcite .",
    "a quadratic function has been introduced in the model .",
    "using these modifications authors obtained the dynamical regimes of subthreshold oscillation , corresponding to the periodical oscillation of neuron s transmembrane potential below the excitation threshold .",
    "in @xcite the dynamics of two coupled piece - wise linear one - dimensional monostable maps is investigated .",
    "the single map is associated with poincar section of the fitzhugh - nagumo neuron model .",
    "it is found that a diffusive coupling leads to the appearance of chaotic attractor .",
    "the attractor exists in an invariant region of phase space bounded by the manifolds of the saddle fixed point and the saddle periodic point .",
    "the oscillations from the chaotic attractor have a spike - burst shape with anti - phase synchronized spiking .",
    "a map - based neuron model involving quasi - periodic oscillation for generating the bursting activity has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "izhikevich and hoppenstead have classified @xcite map - based one- and two - dimensional models of bursting activity using bifurcation theory .",
    "our goal here is to introduce a new map - based model for replication of many basic modes of neuron activity",
    ". the greater part of our paper deals with regimes that mimic chaotic spiking - bursting activity of one real biological neuron .",
    "we construct a discontinuous two - dimensional map based on well - known one - dimensional lorenz - type map @xcite and a discrete version of the fitzhugh - nagumo model@xcite .",
    "this is the system of two ode : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the membrane potential of the neuron and @xmath2 is the recovery variable describing ionic currents , @xmath3 is a cubic function of @xmath1 and @xmath4 is constant stimulus .",
    "this model takes into account the excitability and regular oscillations of neuron , but not spiking - bursting behavior .",
    "we shall introduce a discontinuity in the discrete version for this purpose .",
    "we find conditions under which this two - dimensional map has an invariant region on the phase plane , containing chaotic attractor .",
    "in addition we show that depending on the values of the parameters , our model can produce phasic spiking and subthreshold oscillations also .",

    "in this section consider the case @xmath101 and @xmath102 . this case corresponds to instability of the unique fixed point @xmath103 . since parameter @xmath12 is sufficiently small ,",

    "the distinctive characteristic of these systems is two time and velocity scales , so - called `` fast '' and `` slow '' motions .",
    "basically fast motions are provided by `` frozen '' system in which slow variables are regarded as a parameters , and it is assumed that small parameter of the system equals to zero .",

    "since the map @xmath52 has interval @xmath69 for @xmath132 , then a trajectory involving the map @xmath18 belongs to the region @xmath126 as long as its variable @xmath2 do not culminate approximately to the value corresponding to the line @xmath133 ( fig .",
