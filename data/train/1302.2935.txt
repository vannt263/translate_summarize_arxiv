    "smooth manifolds are some of the most important objects in mathematics .",
    "they contain a wealth of geometric information , such as tangent spaces , tangent bundles , differential forms , de  rham cohomology , etc .",
    ", and this information can be put to great use in proving theorems and making calculations . however",
    ", the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps is not closed under many useful constructions , such as subspaces , quotients , function spaces , etc . on the other hand ,",
    "various convenient categories of topological spaces are closed under these constructions , but the geometric information is missing .",
    "can we have the best of both worlds ?",
    "since the 1970 s , the category of manifolds has been enlarged in several different ways to a well - behaved category as described above , and these approaches are nicely summarized and compared in  @xcite . in this paper , we work with diffeological spaces , which were introduced by j.  souriau in his 1980 paper  @xcite , and in particular we study the natural topology that any diffeological space has .",
    "a diffeological space is a set @xmath3 along with a specified set of maps @xmath4 for each open set @xmath5 in @xmath6 and each @xmath7 , satisfying a presheaf condition , a sheaf condition , and a non - triviality condition ( see definition  [ de : diffeological - space ] ) .",
    "given a diffeological space @xmath3 , the @xmath0-topology on @xmath3 is the largest topology making all of the specified maps @xmath4 continuous . in this paper , we make the first detailed study of the @xmath0-topology .",
    "our results include theorems giving properties and characterizations of the @xmath0-topology as well as many examples which show the behaviour that can occur and which rule out some natural conjectures .",
    "our interest in these topics comes from several directions .",
    "first , it is known  @xcite that the topological spaces which arise as the @xmath0-topology of a diffeological space are precisely the @xmath1-generated spaces , which were introduced by jeff smith as a possible convenient category for homotopy theory and were studied by  @xcite .",
    "some of our results help to further understand which spaces are @xmath1-generated , and we include illustrative examples .",
    "second , for any diffeological spaces @xmath3 and @xmath8 , the set @xmath9 of smooth maps from @xmath3 to @xmath8 is itself a diffeological space in a natural way and thus can be endowed with the @xmath0-topology . since the topology arises completely canonically , it is instructive to compare it with other topologies that arise in geometry and analysis when @xmath3 and @xmath8 are taken to be smooth manifolds .",
    "a large part of this paper is devoted to this comparison , and again we give both theorems and illustrative examples .    finally , this paper arose from work on the homotopy theory of diffeological spaces , and can be viewed as the topological groundwork for this project .",
    "it is for this reason that we need to focus on an approach that produces a well - behaved category , rather than working with a theory of infinite - dimensional manifolds , such as the one throroughly developed in the book  @xcite .",
    "we will , however , make use of results from  @xcite , as many of the underlying ideas are related .",
    "here is an outline of the paper , with a summary of the main results :    in section  [ se : background ] , we review some basics of diffeological spaces . for example , we recall that the category of diffeological spaces is complete , cocomplete and cartesian closed , and that it contains the category of smooth manifolds as a full subcategory .",
    "moreover , like smooth manifolds , every diffeological space is formed by gluing together open subsets of @xmath6 , with the difference that @xmath10 can vary and that the gluings are not necessarily via diffeomorphisms .    in section",
    "[ se : d - topology ] , we study the @xmath0-topology of a diffeological space , which was introduced by iglesias - zemmour in  @xcite . we show that the @xmath0-topology is determined by the smooth curves ( theorem  [ th : curves ] ) , while diffeologies are not ( example  [ diffeology ] ) .",
    "we recall a result of  @xcite which says that the topological spaces arising as the @xmath0-topology of a diffeological space are exactly the @xmath1-generated spaces ( proposition  [ delta ] ) .",
    "we give a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for a space to be @xmath1-generated ( propositions  [ la ] and  [ countable ] ) and show that neither is necessary and sufficient ( proposition  [ pr : fc ] and example  [ lpc ] ) .",
    "we can associate two topologies to a subset of a diffeological space .",
    "we discuss some conditions under which the two topologies coincide ( lemmas  [ l1 ] and  [ l2 ] , proposition  [ pr : topologies - agree ] , and corollary  [ d - open ] ) .",
    "section  [ se : function - spaces ] contains our most substantial results .",
    "we compare the @xmath0-topology on function spaces between smooth manifolds with other well - known topologies .",
    "the results are ( 1 ) the @xmath0-topology is almost always strictly finer than the compact - open topology ( proposition  [ pr : d - vs - compact - open ] and example  [ compare ] ) ; ( 2 ) the @xmath0-topology is always finer than the weak topology ( proposition  [ weakvsd ] ) and always coarser than the strong topology ( theorem  [ th : d - vs - strong ] ) ; ( 3 ) we give a full characterization of the @xmath0-topology as the smallest @xmath1-generated topology containing the weak topology ( theorem  [ conj : d - top ] ) ; ( 4 ) as a consequence , we show that the weak topology is equal to the @xmath0-topology if and only if the weak topology is locally path - connected ( corollary  [ iff : weak = d ] ) ; ( 5 ) in particular , when the codomain is @xmath6 or the domain is compact , the @xmath0-topology coincides with the weak topology ( corollary  [ cor : n = r ] and corollary  [ m - cpt ] ) , but not always ( example  [ weak - neq - d ] ) .",
    "all smooth manifolds in this paper are assumed to be hausdorff , second countable and without boundary .",
    "we would like to thank andrew stacey and chris schommer - pries for very helpful conversations , and jeremy brazas for the idea behind example  [ lpc ] .",
