    "electro - mechanical and mechano - electrical transductions phenomena have historically contributed greatly to the advancement of technology in our society .",
    "today , such operations can be achieved on the single - molecular level with obvious advantages brought about by the miniaturization of the devices involved .",
    "in addition qualitatively novel functionalities become available due to new physics that becomes relevant in materials structured on the nanometer length scale .",
    "quantum mechanics and electron - electron ( coulomb ) correlations are defining ingredients of mesoscopic physics , which applies to nanoscale devices whose properties may be determined by a single or a few degrees of freedom . as a result",
    "there is a possibility and also an advantage to be gained by taking quantum coherence into account when designing electro - mechanical devices for the purpose of quantum manipulation and quantum communication .",
    "the single - electron tunneling ( set ) transistor is a nanodevice with particularly prominent mesoscopic features . here , the coulomb blockade of single - electron tunneling at low voltage bias and temperature @xcite makes ohm s law for the electrical conductance invalid in the sense that the electrical current is not necessarily proportional to the voltage drop across the device .",
    "instead , the current is due to a temporally discrete set of events where electrons tunnel quantum - mechanically one - by - one from a source to a drain electrode via a nanometer size island ( a  quantum dot \" ) .",
    "this is why the properties of a single electronic quantum state are crucial for the operation of the entire device .    since the probability for quantum mechanical tunneling is exponentially sensitive to the tunneling distance it follows that the position of the quantum dot relative to the electrodes is crucial . on the other hand",
    "the strong coulomb forces that accompany the discrete nanoscale charge fluctuations , which are a necessary consequence of a current flow through the set device , might cause a significant deformation of the device and move the dot , hence giving rise to a strong electro - mechanical coupling .",
    "this unique feature makes the so - called nanoelectromechanical set ( nem - set ) devices , where mechanical deformation can be achieved along with electronic operations , to be one of the best nanoscale realizations of electromechanical transduction .    in this review",
    "we will discuss some of the latest achievements in the nano - electromechanics of nem - set devices focusing on the new functionality that exploits quantum coherence in both the electronic and the mechanical subsystems .",
    "the choice of materials for making a nem - set device brings an additional dimension to exploring its quantum performance . by choosing superconductors or magnets as components of the device",
    "one may , e.g. , take advantage of a macroscopic ordering of electrons with respect to both their charge and spin .",
    "we will discuss how the electronic charge as well as the electronic spin contribute to electromechanical and mechano - electrical transduction in a nem - set device .",
    "new effects appear also due to the high mechanical deformability of molecular nem - set structures ( polaronic effects ) which could be accompanied with effects of strong electron - electron interactions ( coulomb blockade and luttinger liquid phenomena ) as well as effects caused by strong tunneling coupling ( kondo- nano - mechanics ) .",
    "the phenomenon of shuttling and the sensitivity of electronic tunneling probabilities to mechanical deformation of the device are in the focus of the present review . in this sense it is",
    "is an update of our earlier reviews of shuttling @xcite .",
    "other aspects of nanoelectromechanics are only briefly discussed here .",
    "we refer readers to the well - known reviews of refs .   on nanoelectromechanical systems for additional information .",
    "this review is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the basic concepts of electron shuttling ( subsection ii.a ) and consider the influence of polaronic effects on the shuttle instability ( subsection ii.b ) . in the end of this subsection",
    "the quantum shuttle is introduced and briefly discussed . section iii deals with the shuttling of cooper pairs ( subsection iii.a ) and polaronic effects on the josephson current through a vibrating quantum dot ( subsection iii.b ) .",
    "a novel phenomenon  magnetic shuttling  is considered in section iv , where the effects of spin - controlled shuttling of electric charge ( subsection iv.a ) , the spintro - mechanics of the magnetic shuttle ( subsection iv.b ) and mechanical transportation of magnetization ( subsection iv.c ) are discussed . in the end of section",
    "iii the kondo regime of electron shuttling is reviewed ( subsection iv.d ) .",
    "recent experiments on the observation of electron shuttling are briefly discussed in section v. section vi summarizes the latest theoretical achievements in nanoelectromechanics of shuttle devices .",
    "a single - electron shuttle can be considered as the ultimate miniaturization of a classical electric pendulum capable of transferring macroscopic amounts of charge between two metal plates . in both cases",
    "the electric force acting on a charged  ball \" that is free to move in a potential well between two metal electrodes kept at different electrochemical potentials , @xmath0 , results in self - oscillations of the ball .",
    "two distinct physical phenomena , namely the quantum mechanical tunneling mechanism for charge loading ( unloading ) of the ball ( in this case more properly referred to as a grain ) and the coulomb blockade of tunneling , distinguish the nanoelectromechanical device known as a single - electron shuttle @xcite ( see also @xcite ) from its classical textbook analog .",
    "the regime of coulomb blockade realized at bias voltages and temperatures @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the charging energy , @xmath3 is the grain s electrical capacitance ) allows one to consider single electron transport through the grain .",
    "electron tunneling , being extremely sensitive to the position of the grain relative to the bulk electrodes , leads to a shuttle instability  the absence of any equilibrium position of an initially neutral grain in the gap between the electrodes .    in subsection",
    "a below we consider the characteristic features of the single - electron shuttle in the case when the shuttle dynamics can be treated as classical motion . quantum corrections to this picture are then discussed in subsection b.      theoretically , it is convenient to study the single - electron shuttle in an approach @xcite where the grain is modeled as a single - level quantum dot ( qd ) that is weakly coupled ( via a tunnel hamiltonian ) to the electrodes ( see fig .",

    "this is in contrast with a classical shuttle @xcite , where stability of the system can be achieved , only at finite mechanical dissipation @xmath63 . in the considered model",
    "the effective dissipation is provided by the hybridization ( @xmath64 ) of the resonant level with the metallic leads .",
    "notice that the cohesive force @xmath65 is unimportant for the developed shuttle motion .",
    "however , this exchange interaction along with the direct electric coupling ( @xmath66 ) determines the growth rate of the shuttle instability , which demonstrates the important role of electron tunneling in the dynamics of single electron shuttling .",
    "what is the role of quantum effects in the vibrational subsystem ?",
    "it is known that the electron - vibron interaction ( second term in eq .",
    "( [ qd ] ) ) results in vibron - assisted electron tunneling @xcite ( the appearance of inelastic channels ) and for @xmath67 in strong suppression of the probability of electron transfer through the elastic channel ( franck - condon blockade @xcite , see also the reviews ) .",
    "could these vibrational effects influence the single - electron shuttling phenomenon ?",

( [ increment ] ) ( the exponential factor and the sum over open inelastic channels ) reflect the influence of two major vibrational effects - the franck - condon blockade and vibron - assisted electron tunneling - on the shuttle instability .",
    "since the dimensionless coupling @xmath33 is always small for molecular devices , the main quantum effect of vibrations is the  polaronic \" narrowing of the bare tunneling width @xmath88 .",
    "it increases with the increase of the number of new channels ( @xmath89 ) and reaches its maximum at @xmath90 ( @xmath49 is the distance between electrodes , @xmath18 is the mass of the vibrating molecule ) . a nonmonotonic dependence of the increment rate of the shuttle instability on @xmath37 is shown in fig .",

    ". however , if the grain is pinned or if there is strong friction in the system , @xmath95 , the shuttle instability takes place at much higher voltages when @xmath96 . in this case large oscillations of the increment parameter could lead to unusual behavior of the i - v characteristics for a shuttle - based single - electron transistor . a small change in bias voltage ( smaller than @xmath97 )",
    "would take the system from the shuttle regime of transport ( with strongly enhanced electron tunneling probability ) to the ordinary regime of tunnel transport ( small tunneling probability ) and the other way around .",

    "this behavior is characterized by pronounced quantum fluctuations and can be interpreted as a quantum shuttle .",
    "it is difficult to detect a quantum shuttle by measuring the average current since its qualitative behavior has no distinctive features in comparison with the classical shuttle . the noise properties ( and in general the full counting statistics ) of nems will be crucial for detecting single - electron shuttling .",
    "shuttling of electric charges between nonsuperconducting electrodes by itself does not require phase coherence .",
    "even in the quantum regime of the coulomb blockade , when only a single ( resonant ) level is involved in electron transport , phase coherent effects have little influence on electron shuttling .",
    "this is not the case for magnetic and superconducting leads .",
    "magnetic exchange forces make the coherent electron - spin dynamics important for electron shuttling .",
    "superconducting transport is by definition a phase coherent phenomenon and thus cooper - pair shuttling has to be strongly different from single - electron shuttling .    in this section",
    "we consider shuttling of cooper pairs between two superconducting electrodes ( subsection a ) and the influence of vibrational modes on the josephson current .",
    "the main requirement for the observation of a mechanically mediated josephson current @xcite is that phase coherence is preserved during the transportation of cooper pairs between the two superconducting leads , and during the process of transferring charge between the bulk superconductors and a movable superconducting grain .",

    "it is useful to separate the adiabatic motion of the single - cooper - pair box between the two superconducting electrodes into two different parts : ( i ) the free motion ( transportation region in fig .",

    "4 ) . during the free motion ,",
    "when the josephson energy is negligibly small and the coulomb term dominates , the dynamics of the qubit is reduced to the time evolution of the relative phase @xmath137 due to the second term in eq .",

    "it is worth to point out that the phenomenon we are going to discuss here has nothing to do with transferring electric charge in the device and it is valid also for a device made of nonconducting material .",
    "the main effect , which will be in the focus of our attention , is the exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic shuttle ( dot ) and the magnetic leads .",
    "this interaction decays exponentially when the dot moves away from a lead and hence it is only important when the dot is close to one of the leads . during the periodic back - and - forth motion of the dot this happens during short time intervals near the turning points of the mechanical motion .",
    "an exchange interaction between the magnetizations of the dot and a lead results in a rotation of these two magnetization vectors in such a way that the vector sum is conserved .",

    "it is particularly interesting that the sign of the resulting magnetic interaction is determined by the sign of @xmath258 .",

    "the many - electron scattering processes then lead to the formation of an abrikosov - suhl resonance .",
    "this resonance can be viewed as a kondo cloud built up from both conduction electrons in the leads and a localized electron in the dot .",
    "since all electrons in the cloud contain information about the same impurity , they are mutually correlated . thus , nem providing a coupling between mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom introduces a powerful tool for manipulation and control of the kondo cloud and gives a very promising and efficient mechanism for electromechanical transduction on the nanometer length scale .        building on an analogy with the shuttling experiments of refs . and ,",

    "while the dc current is mostly responsible for the frequency shift , the ac current gives an access to the dynamics of the kondo cloud and provides information about the kinetics of its formation . in order to evaluate both contributions to the total current we rotate the electronic states in the leads in such a way that only one combination of the wave functions",

    "equation ( [ 4.5 ] ) allows one to obtain information about the dynamics of the kondo clouds from an analysis of an experimental investigation of the mechanical vibrations .",

    "this is achieved by a clever design that minimizes the electrical coupling between the driving part of the device ( either a magnetomotively driven , doubly clamped beam resonator , or a capacitively coupled remote cantilever ) and the driven part ( the cantilever that carries the shuttle on its tip ) . in principle , systems of this type can be used for studies of shuttle transport through superconducting and magnetic systems .    in ref .",
