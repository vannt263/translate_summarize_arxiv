    "observations with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) of neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) have led to the discovery of kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in about 20 sources ( van der klis 2000 for a review ) .",
    "the khz qpo frequency is always correlated with position in the tracks traced out by these sources in x - ray color - color diagrams .",
    "this usually implies khz qpo frequency is correlated with x - ray count rate , but anticorrelation also occurs ( wijnands et al .",
    "1997 , homan et al .",
    "2001 , this paper ) . on time scales",
    "longer than hours to days the count - rate / frequency correlations usually break down ( e.g. , mndez 1999 ; see also van der klis 2001 ) .",
    "usually a pair of khz qpo peaks is observed ( called lower and upper khz qpo in order of increasing frequency ) , with a frequency separation @xmath2 that varies in anticorrelation with , but by much less than , the khz qpo frequencies themselves . in sco x-1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) for variations in frequency by @xmath0500hz , @xmath2 varies by @xmath070hz .",
    "numerous models have been proposed to explain the khz qpos ( see van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "most associate one of the two khz qpo frequencies with the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "miller , lamb & psaltis ( 1998 ) describe how the khz qpo frequency can be affected by radiative stresses ( both drag and radial force ) .",
    "the @xmath06hz normal - branch oscillation ( nbo ) seen in the most luminous lmxbs , the z sources , is probably related to near - eddington accretion ( e.g. hasinger et al .",
    "1990 ; but see wijnands , van der klis and rijkhorst 1999 ) .",
    "several models have been proposed for the nbo ( see  [ disc ] ) .    in the z source sco x-1 ,",
    "the nbo occurs simultaneously with khz qpos ( van der klis 1996 , 1997 ) . at a fractional rms amplitude of 3 - 5% it dominates the 4 - 8  hz x - ray variability .",
    "if the nbo - modulated flux originates from within or near the inner disk radius then the associated 6-hz modulation of the drag on the inner disk could modulate the orbital frequency there . if khz qpo frequencies are indeed related to orbital frequency , a modulation with nbo phase would be expected . if , on the other hand , the 6-hz modulation originates further out , or the khz qpo frequencies have another origin , then such modulation of the khz qpo frequencies would not be predicted .",
    "so , clues to the origin of both khz qpos and slower fluctuations can be obtained by monitoring the khz qpos on subsecond time scales . in this letter , we perform the first study of this kind .",
    "we investigate the response of the khz qpos to the flux variations due to the nbo in sco x-1 .",
    "we find , that while the response of the khz qpo frequencies to the 6-hz flux variations is similar to ( but probably less strong than ) that to slower variations in flux , the power ratio of the two khz peaks varies in the _ opposite _ sense .",
    "we discuss how these findings can help our understanding of both nbo and khz qpos .",
    "we analyzed 260 kev high time - resolution data taken of sco x-1 between feb 1996 and july 1998 with the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) . based on 1/16  hz resolution fourier power spectra of individual @xmath024 ks continuous data segments , we selected segments where the upper khz qpo was significant at @xmath3 , and the nbo was strong ( peak leahy power @xmath45.0 ) , narrow ( fwhm @xmath024 hz ) , and between 6 and 8 hz ( table 1 ) .",
    "we used data from all active pcus ( 3 - 5 ) .",
    "the 260 kev count rate was @xmath5 c / s per pcu .",
    "lower khz qpos were detected in about 1/3 of the segments .",
    "we made ffts with length @xmath6 s and time resolution 1/4096 s. the frequency resolution of the resulting power spectra is 32 hz and the nyquist frequency 2048 hz .",
    "we compared the counts in non - overlapping pairs of successive power spectra .",
    "let the number of counts in the @xmath7th pair of successive power spectra be @xmath8 for the higher count - rate power spectrum of the pair , and @xmath9 for the lower count - rate one .",
    "we then selected those pairs for which the statistic @xmath10 exceeds a given pre - set value .",
    "@xmath11 is a measure for the significance of the count - rate difference between the two power spectra in each pair .",
    "we used those selected pairs to construct a high - rate sample of power spectra , with corresponding selected @xmath12 values , and a low - rate sample , with corresponding @xmath13 values .",
    "two criteria were used in the pair selection : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we also combined the two to get the sample corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "we averaged the high - rate and low - rate power spectra separately and fitted the average power spectra in the 3001800 hz range with two lorentzians ( for the two khz qpos ) plus a line ( for the dead - time modified poisson noise ) .",
    "all the uncertainties were determined using @xmath17 .",
    "the difference @xmath18 is related to the fourier power around frequency @xmath19 .",
    "hence , with @xmath6s we sample the fluctuations near 16 hz . to cover lower frequencies we constructed longer segments of duration @xmath20 where @xmath21 , which sample frequencies of @xmath22  hz .",
    "we calculated the total counts and the average of the @xmath23 power spectra in each @xmath20 wide segment , and constructed high - rate and low - rate average power spectra for these longer segments in the same way as above for @xmath24 .",
    "the frequency and amplitude of the khz qpos were then determined by fitting each high - rate and low - rate average power spectrum for each n as described above .",
    "counting statistics of course contribute to the count differences between the segments , but at near - nbo frequencies the nbo by far dominates the variability .",
    "monte - carlo simulations show that the contribution of counting statistics to the count differences is @xmath02% for @xmath25 , and @xmath08% for @xmath15 ; around the nbo frequency these numbers drop to @xmath00.5% and @xmath06% , respectively . with the exception of figure 3 , where we report absolute count rates ,",
    "the average count differences and derived quantities reported in this paper have all been corrected for this counting - statistics bias associated with our selection procedure .",
    "the khz qpos in the average power spectra were significant at @xmath26 , except the lower khz qpo in the high - rate sample for n=1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "below we refer to the frequencies of the lower and upper khz qpo as @xmath28 and @xmath1and mark parameters for the high - rate and low - rate samples with `` h '' , and `` l '' .",
    "fig .  1 , shows results for @xmath29 .",
    "fig.1a is the average power spectrum of the observations , showing the nbo peak .",
    "fig.1b shows the difference @xmath30 between @xmath31 in the low- and high - rate samples . near the nbo frequency",
    ", @xmath32 is 1020 hz larger than @xmath33 . as the counting - statistics - corrected average count - rate difference between the high and the low - rate samples @xmath34 is different at each frequency ( i.e. , each @xmath23 ) , we show in fig.1c @xmath30 normalized to count - rate difference ( in units of counts per 1/32 s ) .",
    "also when normalized this way , there is a clear anticorrelation between @xmath1 and count rate .",
    "the lower khz frequencies @xmath35 and @xmath36 are consistent with being the same near the nbo frequency , and the frequency separation @xmath2 between the two peaks is larger in the low - rate sample : @xmath37 . however , as shown in fig.1d , this is only a 2-@xmath38 effect and could be affected by the strength variations in the peaks reported below .",
    "fig.2 shows the average high- and low - rate power spectra for n=2 and @xmath39 .",
    "the raw measured integrated leahy powers are 2.5@xmath400.5 and 7.2@xmath400.5 at low count rate and 0.09@xmath400.39 and 4.7@xmath400.4 at high count rate for lower and upper khz peak , respectively .",
    "the dashed line marks @xmath31 of the low - rate sample , @xmath41 hz . at high count rate",
    "only the upper khz qpo , at @xmath42 hz , is significant .",
    "taken at face value , fig .",
    "2 suggests that on the nbo time scale , going to higher count rate , the lower khz qpo weakens by a large factor , while the upper one remains comparatively constant in strength ( it weakens by a factor of only 1.5 ) .",
    "however , in view of the large and uncertain deadtime effects at these count rates , we can not exclude that instead the upper peak becomes much stronger but the entire high - rate spectrum is suppressed by differential deadtime ( van der klis et al .",
    "the ratio between the two khz qpo powers is less sensitive to dead time ( see van der klis et al .",
    "for @xmath43 the ratio @xmath44 of lower to upper khz qpo power is lower at high rate sample than at low rate , but not significantly so ( 1@xmath38 ) . at @xmath15 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath44 is 0.35@xmath400.08 at low rate , @xmath45 larger than the value of 0.02@xmath400.08 at high rate .",
    "the average count rates and @xmath1 values for n=2 using selections @xmath14 and @xmath15 are shown in fig.3 .",
    "no correction for counting - statistics bias was performed ; the outer and inner points should be 6% and 0.5% closer together , respectively .",
    "the anticorrelation between @xmath1 and the average count rate is obvious .",
    "it is of interest to compare these short - term correlations to those on longer time scales .",
    "the khz qpo frequencies vary too little in our observations ( @xmath4610701093hz ) to determine the flux - frequency relation on the 10100  s time scales on which the z track is traced out .",
    "we can measure this relation in an observation on april 24 , 1997 , when sco x-1 was on its normal branch , covering a wider range of frequencies ( @xmath4610001100hz ) .",
    "the nbo was weaker and broader then . using 128-sec data segments , we find that also on these longer time scales , @xmath31 and count rate are anticorrelated .",
    "this is as expected , as on the normal branch ( nb ) of sco x-1 count rate and position on the z track are anticorrelated ( priedhorsky et al .",
    "1986 ; dieters & van der klis 2000 , see also van der klis 2001 ) .",
    "the fractional frequency shift @xmath47 is 1.51@xmath400.03 times the fractional count - rate variation @xmath48 on these longer time scales . on the nbo time scale",
    "this is 0.43@xmath400.11 , about 1/3 of that on longer time scales .",
    "( deadtime corrections on @xmath48 were neglected here , as both @xmath49 and @xmath50 were nearly equal in the two cases so that the corrections do not affect the final conclusion . ) in principle this difference could be caused by our method to select high and low count rates caused by the nbo .",
    "however , as we corrected our results for counting - statistics bias , to the extent that the dependence of khz qpo frequency on the nbo flux variations can be considered linear ( which is likely as the variations in nbo amplitude and khz qpo frequency are both @xmath515% ) , these numbers can be directly compared .",
    "of course , they were derived from different data sets .",
    "we find that the power ratio @xmath44 , in contrast to what is seen on the nbo time scale , on long time scales increases with count rate , from about 0.5 at @xmath52  1100 hz to about 1.0 at @xmath521000 hz ( this confirms what is indicated by the results shown in figure 3d in van der klis et al . 1997 ; however , in our current analysis , contrary to that work , we completely cover the 10001100hz range without gaps ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 is 0.6 times @xmath54 on long time scales ; on the nbo time scale this is @xmath552 .",
    "so , a similar anticorrelation between khz qpo frequency and flux occurs in sco x-1 on the nb both on long time scales and on the nbo time scale , but the weakening of the lower khz qpo relative to the upper khz qpo that we observe towards higher count rate on the nbo time scale is _ opposite _ to that observed on longer time scales .",
    "in response to the @xmath06  hz flux variations due to the nbo in sco x-1 the upper khz qpo frequency @xmath1 decreases with count rate . this is qualitatively , yet not quantitatively consistent with the behavior of sco x-1 on the normal branch on longer time scales , which , however , due to statistics we could only measure using a different method and in another data set , and at khz qpo frequencies including , but mostly below those where we measured the short - term correlation .",
    "the lower khz qpo weakens relative to the upper one when flux increases on the nbo time scale .",
    "this is _ opposite _ to what ( on the nb for @xmath56hz ) is observed on longer time scales .",
    "the weakness of the lower khz qpo in the high count - rate phase of the nbo cycle limits the accuracy of the determination of its frequency shifts .",
    "although the frequency separation between the two peaks appears different between the high count - rate phase and the low count - rate phase , we can not rule out the possibility that it remains constant . in any case ,",
    "our results show that both frequency and amplitude of khz qpos are affected by flux variations on subsecond time scales , and that in some respects khz qpos react differently to nbo - related flux variations than to slower ones .",
    "the frequency shift of 22 hz we observe in the upper khz qpo peak on the nbo time scale is of the same order as its width ( fwhm@xmath070  hz ) .",
    "so , the width of the upper khz qpo peak usually reported is due in part to short - time - scale variations in khz qpo frequency that went unnoticed up to now . as our measurements show that the khz qpo signals also change in relative strength on this time scale",
    ", the short - term fluctuations must also affect the @xmath2 measured on longer time scales : due to what is happening on the nbo time scale , in power spectra averaged over longer time intervals the khz qpo peaks appear closer together than they really are .",
    "the fact that the lower khz qpo becomes _ weaker _ with respect to the upper khz qpo with increasing count rate on the nbo time scale , but _",
    "stronger _ on longer time scales , strongly suggests that two different mechanisms produce the count rate variations on these two time scales , which interact with the khz qpo production mechanism in different ways .",
    "the coupling between the khz qpos and the nbo provides clues to the origin of both phenomena .",
    "one possibility for",
    "the nbo is that it is a disk oscillation mode in a subsonic region of a thick disk , as suggested in the sound wave model of alpar et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . in this model ,",
    "the nbo frequency is of the same order as the orbital frequency in a thick disk .",
    "if the upper khz qpo is also related to an orbital frequency , the nbo is clearly generated at a much larger radius .",
    "the mass accretion rate in the inner disk region could then be modulated by this oscillation , and in that way affect @xmath1 . the same relation between @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "would then be expected to hold not only qualitatively but also quantitatively on both long time scales and the nbo time scale , which seems inconsistent with our results .",
    "however , our measured long - term and short - term values do not refer to the same data set and were measured using different methods .",
    "another possibility is that the nbo is associated with a radial accretion mode , as proposed in the radiation feed - back model ( fortner , lamb and miller 1989 , miller and park 1995 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux modulation in this model arises either by modulation of the mass inflow rate of the radial inflow , or by modulation of its compton scattering opacity . as shown in fig.3 , when @xmath31 is around 1080 hz , the frequency decreases by @xmath02% for an increase in average count rate by @xmath05% . from equation 39 in miller et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , at an accretion rate of @xmath57 eddington and a constant radius near the the marginally stable orbit ( this may approximately represent the accretion state of sco x-1 when the nbo is observed ) , a flux variation of 6.5% would yield an orbital frequency change of @xmath0 5% due to a change in radial radiation force , which is of the same order of magnitude as observed .",
    "both radiation drag and radial force effects would lead to increase radius when flux increases .",
    "this suggests that the frequency shifts may be caused by the modulation in the radiative stresses caused by the nbo .",
    "for this the inner boundary of the radial inflow , where it produces its radiation , should be well inside the inner disk boundary , some 16 km for a 1.4 m@xmath58 neutron star at a @xmath1 of 1080hz .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that this flow produces its radiation at or close to the neutron star surface .",
    "the quantitative difference between the @xmath31 variation on the nbo time scale and that on longer time scales may come from the fact that the nbo is only related to the radial inflow , which takes place outside the equatorial plane , while the long - term variation is related to the accretion flow through the disk , accreting in the equatorial regions .",
    "the radiation from near the equator may interact more strongly with the inner disk than that emitted from higher latitudes .",
    "a third possibility is that the nbo originates from the neutron star surface by a mechanism such as g - modes ( bildsten and ushomirsky 1996 ) .",
    "this can lead to radiative stresses which modulate the upper khz qpo frequency .",
    "finally , the lapidus , nobili & turolla ( 1994 ) mechanism for photospheric oscillations during x - ray bursts , which relies on a near - eddington flux , could perhaps also work in sco x-1 to generate a flux variation at the nbo frequency emerging from the neutron star surface .",
    "we have found that the flux - frequency correlation on the nbo time scale and on longer time scales has the same sign in sco x-1 on the normal branch : frequency drops when count rate increases .",
    "the situation on sco x-1 s normal branch is actually unusual ; what is more commonly observed ( on time scales of hours to days ) is that frequency increases with count rate .",
    "it is interesting to ask what would be observed if in such a case the dependence of khz qpo frequency on nbo phase could be measured .",
    "if the general idea is correct that the radiative stresses on the inner disk edge , modulated at the nbo frequency by some other mechanism than a modulation of the disk accretion rate , lead to the observed frequency shifts of the upper khz qpo , then this anticorrelation would be expected to hold for all nbo signals produced in the same way as in sco x-1 .",
    "the prediction is that in the more usual situation of a positive long - term correlation between khz qpo frequency and count rate , on the nbo time scale there would still be an anticorrelation , so that then the long and short - term effects would be of opposite sign .",
    "however , there is evidence that nbos arise variously as a consequence of luminosity and radiative - transfer fluctuations ( fortner et al . 1989 ) , so that the complete picture may be more complex than suggested by this line of reasoning .",
    "as the frequency correlations between qpos and noise among neutron star and black hole x - ray binaries occur over a wide range of source types and luminosities , further study of how these features are correlated on short time scales will help reveal the origin of qpos and noise components , and understand the tracks in the plot of khz qpo frequency vs. x - ray flux .",
    "the study of the khz qpo or high frequency qpo in response to qpo and noise components at lower frequencies in black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries are particularly promising approaches .",
