    "the discovery of new superconductors in the last dozen years , with mgb@xmath1 found to be superconducting at t@xmath2=40 k [ ] and fe - based pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors ( fescs ) up to 56 k , has reinvigorated the search for new superconductors . while mgb@xmath1 remains a class of one material , the fescs like the cuprates have blossomed into several subclasses with dozens of members .",
    "the discovery of a new ni - c superconductor in a distinct structural class provides reason for rapid follow up to understand its properties , establish its relationships to other superconductors , and perhaps to extend the class .    the recent discovery by machado , grant , and fisk@xcite ( mgf ) that th@xmath1nic@xmath1 superconducts at t@xmath2=8.5 k , increasing to 11.2 k when alloyed with sc , raises questions besides whether it might lead to other members of this structural class,@xcite possibly with higher t@xmath2 .",
    "notably , mgf have categorized it as a very low density of states ( dos ) superconductor , because the specific heat coefficient extrapolated from a c(t)/t versus t@xmath8 plot is vanishingly small  certainly an exceptional feature and one that is difficult to reconcile with metallic and superconducting behavior .",

    "the deformation potentials range from nearly zero up to 2 ev /  , indicating significant but not unusually large coupling to fermi surface states .",
    "note that the largest coupling is to the zone center flat band at e@xmath10 .    for some indication of the coupling of th motion to electronic states ,",
    "th was displaced along the @xmath22-axis by @xmath84 , again a large phonon amplitude for a heavy atom .",
    "even so , the bands near the fermi level shift very little compared to c displacement , indicating weak coupling to th motion .",
    "unusual behavior of a material can often be linked directly to fine structure at e@xmath10 , with examples showing new characteristics appearing recently .",
    "the most common situation is that of conventional van hove singularities ( see below ) , which are generic to a band structure . more interesting because they are unconventional are other types of band anomalies .",
    "an example showing some similarities to th@xmath1nic@xmath1 is naalsi : it is a ternary semimetal with superconducting t@xmath2=7 k , and displays an unusually sharp peak in n(e ) at the fermi level due to hybridization between slightly overlapping valence and conduction bands.@xcite another example is the intermetallic compound nbfe@xmath1 , which displays a quantum critical point slightly off stoichiometry.@xcite study of the band structure led to the prediction that the critical behavior is due to a van hove singularity with one divergent effective mass@xcite ( a [ @xmath85 ^ 3 $ ] dispersion in one direction ) that was confirmed by coherent potential approximation alloy calculations.@xcite the enigmatic intermetallic compound tibe@xmath1 , a highly enhanced incipient ferromagnet with strongly temperature dependent susceptibility and knight shift , displays dos fine structure@xcite at e@xmath10 as well .",
    "experimentally , the interesting features of th@xmath1nic@xmath1 are ( 1 ) superconductivity in a new ni - based material , ( 2 ) t@xmath2 is enhanced by 30% by minor doping by sc , and ( 3 ) the extrapolation of the heat capacity suggests vanishing electronic dos at the fermi level , causing questions about the observed metallic and superconducting behavior . these first principles calculations presented above reveal unusually fine structure in the electronic bands at e@xmath10 , structure that should affect several properties of the undoped compound . in this case , the fine structure is due to spin - orbit coupling induced splitting of band degeneracies together with the usual mixing of bands .",
    "the effective fermi energy @xmath86 10 mev implies non - degenerate electron gas behavior beginning at a few tens of kelvins ; the energy variation of n(e ) requires attention when considering thermodynamic and transport coefficients . the standard simple use of `` n(e@xmath10 ) ''",
    "has to be replaced with a formalism that incorporates the non - degeneracy .",
    "additionally , the ni - c stretch mode with energy @xmath87 = 70 mev , which seems moderately strongly coupled to fs states and is a candidate for the pairing mechanism , will have non - adiabatic contributions : n(e ) varies strongly over the regions ( -@xmath87,@xmath87 ) so that standard eliashberg theory based on the born - oppenheimer approximation no longer holds .",
    "it should also be noted that n(e ) beyond the narrow peak on the positive energy side is @xmath5950% larger than on the negative energy side ; electron- and hole - doping should be substantially different , with electron - doping providing larger n(e@xmath10 ) .",
    "variation of n(e ) on a scale of importance for properties , discussed especially for van hove singularities , has a long history and large literature .",
    "this area of interest was spurred initially by the flat bands and van hove singularities that arise in the superconducting a15 compounds,@xcite and figured even more prominently for the high temperature superconducting cuprates ; see for example ref .",
    "a general formalism for including effects of both thermal smearing and electron - phonon broadening was given by one of the present authors.@xcite at the most fundamental level , the chemical potential ( `` fermi level '' ) becomes dependent on temperature .",
    "for the symmetric peak in n(e ) that we obtain , this shift may be minor ; however , off - stoichiometry can readily change this . in the normal state",
    "the consequences of dos variation affect the spin susceptibility and transport properties as well as the electronic heat capacity , and also complicates the effects due to defects@xcite through broadening of n(e ) .",
    "first principles methods have been applied to illuminate the electronic , vibrational , and doping behavior in the newly discovered superconductor th@xmath1nic@xmath1 .",
    "while the fermi level is found to fall in a rather low density of states region , we obtain a value of n(e@xmath10 ) that should be easily detectable experimentally , and which we have not been able to reconcile with the extrapolation of specific heat data from above t@xmath2 that implies an essentially vanishing n(e@xmath10 ) . the ni @xmath3 bands of this compound are essentially filled , consistent with a `` neutral ni '' picture , but some regions of the fermi surface still have considerable ni character while other portions are more heavily c - derived .",
    "the distinctive aspect of the electronic structure is very fine structure lying precisely ( but accidentally ) at the fermi level , a result that is only obtained when spin - orbit coupling is included .",
    "slight hole doping ( @xmath591% ) can change n(e@xmath10 ) by a factor of two , and it is plausible that such intrinsic hole doping helps to stabilize the material . from this reference point ,",
    "the rise in n(e@xmath10 ) with further doping can help to account for the observed increase in t@xmath2 with hole doping . within this scenario , electron doping would strongly increase n(e@xmath10 ) and thereby the superconducting t@xmath2 .    doping with sc for th that increases t@xmath2 by 30% in this system has been studied in two ways : virtual crystal approximation , and substitutional replacement in a supercell . while vca gives a rigid band result as anticipated , the supercell method suggests there is some shift in spectral density just below the fermi level due to th replacement by sc . the movement of the fermi level downward by this substitution also results in somewhat stronger ni - c bonding character , hence larger electron - phonon matrix elements participating to an increase in t@xmath2 . the phonon dispersion curves display distinct clusters of branches distributed up to 70 mev .",
    "the two high frequency branches derive from the c - ni - c stretch modes .",
    "frozen phonon calculations involving displacements of ( separately ) the c and th atoms indicates significant electron - phonon coupling of the c atoms but insignificant coupling to th motion .",
    "the superconductivity in this system seems consistent with an electron - phonon mechanism as seems to be the case in most other ni - c superconductors such as those mentioned in the introduction , but we do not have a quantitative estimate of the strength of coupling .",
    "the phonon calculations do not include th substitution by sc , but an interesting possibility is that the light sc atom could produce a local - mode vibron and possible unconventional contribution to electron - phonon coupling .",
