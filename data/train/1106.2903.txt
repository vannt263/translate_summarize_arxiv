    "the slope of the word s norm is steeper in figure [ f3 ] than it is in figure [ f2 ] and the peaks in figure [ f3 ] are associated with larger values of the word s norm than in the case depicted by figure [ f2 ] .",
    "both conditions lead to fewer points @xmath10 that are mapped to a norm of the word that is close to zero .",

    "comparing this graph with figure [ f3 ] provides further evidence that a greater disparity between the multiplicities of @xmath36 results in a smaller resonant set .        to further justify our use of the model case where the fourth entry in @xmath36 is 0 and @xmath126 ,",
