    "<S> ternary fission yields in the reaction @xmath0pu(n@xmath1 , f ) are calculated using a new model which assumes a nucleation - time moderated chemical equilibrium in the low density matter which constitutes the neck region of the scissioning system . </S>",

    "<S> a reasonably good fit to the experimental data is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this model provides a natural explanation for the observed yields of heavier isotopes relative to those of the lighter isotopes , the observation of low proton yields relative to @xmath2h and @xmath3h yields and the non - observation of @xmath3he , all features which are shared by similar thermal neutron induced and spontaneous fissioning systems .    in the fission of a heavy nucleus , </S>",

    "<S> considerable theoretical and experimental effort has been directed towards understanding this type of ternary fission @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> these previous efforts have treated the problem by emphasizing the dominance of one of the following : neck instabilities and rupture @xcite , barrier penetration of pre - formed clusters @xcite or formation of fragments from interacting nucleons in the fission neck region @xcite . however , these models have had only limited success and have been unable to explain such key experimental results as the high yield of scission tritons relative to scission protons @xcite and the non - observation of @xmath5he @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , lestone proposed a model in which a statistical evaporation of the ternary particle is moderated by time dependent emission barriers which evolve as the fissioning nucleus approaches the scission point @xcite . parameterizing the neck radius , the range of the nuclear force , temperature , time , and emission barrier height provided a good reproduction of isotopic yields for @xmath6 and reasonable predictions for @xmath7 .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed ternary fission yields in the reactions of @xmath0pu with thermal neutrons can be interpreted as reflecting nucleation @xcite and cluster formation probabilities in the low density neck between the two large fragments . </S>",

    "<S> b ) nse calculation with nucleation . </S>",
    "<S> nucleation parameters are time @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> fit metric @xmath43 . ]    the use of a nse code to model fragment production encounters two major conceptual issues . </S>",
    "<S> first , the nse code has an infinitely large source of free nucleons from which it can generate clusters while the number of nucleons in the fissioning nucleus is limited . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus is finite and average multiplicities of ternary ejectiles are of the order of @xmath44 per fission events . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no equilibrium distribution of ternary isotopes such as might be established in infinite nuclear matter is expected to exist in a single nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation carried out here should be interpreted as establishing the relative probabilities for the formation of the observed ( and unobserved ) isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , coalescence of nucleons into clusters is a dynamic process requiring time while the fissioning system exists for a limited time span . with the nse code , we have not constrained the size of the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the observed ternary clusters require not more than @xmath45 of the nucleons , the first consideration appears not to be a serious limitation . on the other hand , we find that the dynamic time limit is important and introduce it using a nucleation model approach to the cluster formation . </S>",
    "<S> while developed primarily in a chemical kinetics context @xcite , nucleation models have been proposed for nuclear processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such approaches have much in common with thermal coalescence approaches previously applied to clustering in low density nuclear systems @xcite but explicitly incorporate consideration of cluster formation rates .    </S>",
    "<S> nucleation has been widely studied in chemical systems undergoing phase changes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fragments are formed under the constraints of surface tension and chemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> clusters grow or diminish through capturing or releasing single nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of larger mass changes is expected to be orders of magnitude lower and thus is generally neglected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for application to nucleation in nuclear matter demo and kozisek have proposed a single component nucleation model which allows derivation of a relatively simple analytical expression for the yield distribution as a function of normalized time @xmath46 , where @xmath20 is density , @xmath47 is the critical cluster size , @xmath19 is temperature , and @xmath48 is time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that expression is @xmath49 erfc \\big[b(t , \\sigma ) \\frac{[(a </S>",
    "<S> / a_c)^{1/3}-1]+(1-a_c^{-1/3})\\exp(-\\tau)}{\\sqrt{1-\\exp(-2\\tau)}}\\big ] \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where the @xmath50 $ ] term representing the equilibrium concentration of the species of mass @xmath51 is modulated by a complementary error function term which depends upon the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath47 where @xmath53 @xmath54 is the range of the effective nucleon potential taken as @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the droplet surface tension . </S>",
    "<S> a temperature dependent formula for @xmath56 is given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the relatively low temperatures in this study , it can be treated as a constant @xmath57 . in nucleation theory </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 , the critical cluster size , is viewed as the size below which clusters break down and above which clusters grow . in our application of this approach </S>",
    "<S> , we treat both @xmath58 and @xmath47 as free parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> there is some experimental information on fission times available from previous theoretical and experimental work . while calculated saddle to scission times are relatively short , of the order of @xmath59 @xcite , some experiments have revealed significantly larger times for a large fraction of the events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> crystal blocking experiments find long time components to the fission process that may extend out to @xmath60 @xcite .    once again after surveying a wide variety of parameter combinations , including temperature , density , proton fraction , time , and @xmath47 values we adopted a multi - parameter minimization technique to simultaneously fit the available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the figure [ fig2]b shows results of the fit in which the addition of the time dependence of the nucleation prevents the yields of heavier isotopes from achieving the nse equilibrium values . the temperature , density and proton fraction fit parameters derived here are the ones used for figure [ fig2]a . </S>",
    "<S> we see that addition of time @xmath41 and @xmath42 to the fits provide a much better representation of the experimental yields . </S>",
    "<S> the fit metric , @xmath61 over the entire range of isotopes . for a fitting range @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> that employed by lestone in his paper , @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamic models based upon an evaporative approach invoke significant barrier lowering in the neck region in attempts to explain both yields and energy spectra @xcite of the light ternary particles . in the more microscopic work of delion </S>",
    "<S> et al . , </S>",
    "<S> the cluster emission is treated as decay from a resonant state in the neck region . in the model proposed here </S>",
    "<S> it has been assumed that , at the time and density at which the cluster emission occurs , the emission barrier has diminished to the point where it is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of the heavier cluster yields is attributed to nucleation time requirements .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in this paper , the assumption of a nucleation modulated approach to nuclear statistical equilibrium , with reasonable parameters , provides a rather good fit to the ternary fission data . </S>",
    "<S> the success suggests that the process is dominated by cluster formation in low temperature low density nucleonic matter . </S>",
    "<S> naturally there is some interplay among the parameters and slight variations in one may be compensated for by changes in another .    </S>",
    "<S> the present approach is useful in understanding some of the main features of the ternary fission data . </S>",
    "<S> for example the yield trend for @xmath63 and @xmath64 yields is well reproduced and the absence of @xmath3he can now be understood as reflecting the very large yield difference for the mirror nuclei @xmath3h and @xmath3he . </S>",
    "<S> the former has a yield of @xmath65 per fission while the latter is not detected . as equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> is approached the ratio of free neutrons to free protons ( those not bound in clusters ) becomes many times larger than the n / z of the fissioning system . in the case </S>",
    "<S> considered here the calculation represented in figure [ fig2]b results in a free neutron to proton ratio of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> such a ratio provides a natural explanation for the low scission proton yield and for missing @xmath3he . at equilibrium the @xmath3h/@xmath3he ratio is directly related to the free @xmath67 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> based on the observed @xmath3h yield and using the calculated free neutron to proton ratio we predict a @xmath3he yield of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this is apparently below the experimental detection limit . </S>",
    "<S> we note that similar reasoning leads to a @xmath69li/@xmath69be ( also mirror nuclei ) ratio of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> based upon the reported @xmath69li yield this leads to a predicted @xmath69be yield of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment reports an upper limit @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> other calculated values presented in figure [ fig2 ] for unobserved isotopes constitute very useful predictions for their yields .    </S>",
    "<S> free cluster binding energies are employed in this work and these are consistent with very low derived densities where the nse approach is expected to be valid . however , it is possible that medium modifications of the binding energies at higher densities play a role in determining the cluster yields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ignoring this effect could lead to an error in the parameter determinations . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation including this medium modification is beyond the scope of the present work but would certainly be interesting .    in general nucleation treatments </S>",
    "<S> use simple scaling relationships to calculate the cluster formation free energies . in the approach proposed here for nuclear clusters experimental binding energies are used . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the isospin , coulomb , and pairing effects on the isotope formation free energies ( and thus on the yields ) are already introduced through use of these binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> the use of these and the associated isotope specific internal partition functions add a level of structural detail not intrinsic in nucleation treatments . since the nucleation model we have employed makes no distinction between protons and neutrons , it is useful to ask whether fits to the isotope mass distributions make any significant change in the quality of the model fits . in figure [ fig3 ] we present results of a minimization procedure fitting the experimental mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> here we see that the quality of the fit to the observed mass distribution ( @xmath73 over the entire range of isotopes ) is significantly better that of the fit to the isotopes presented in figure [ fig2]b . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a binary system nucleation approach , treating neutrons and protons separately , might offer some improvement in modeling the isotope yields and this should be investigated in future work .     </S>",
    "<S> experimental yeilds from koester _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> open data points are the result of nse calculations @xcite with the same parameters featured in the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 fit metric @xmath74 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> of the previous approaches advanced , the treatment by valskii @xcite is most closely related to the present one . </S>",
    "<S> using four parameters , i.e. , the proton work function , the neutron work function , temperature and a scale parameter and assuming all observed isotope yields to reflect statistical equilibrium , valskii fit the yields of detected light isotopes and employed the resultant fit parameter values to predict yields for unobserved species . </S>",
    "<S> these predicted yields for heavier isotopes were far above the observed yields , a result similar to that presented in figure [ fig2]a in which the yields from the basic nse model are shown .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of the present study have several important implications . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the picture presented here , the low energy light particle or fragment accompanied ternary fission may be viewed as a manifestation of a `` pastina '' phase in the low density neck matter produced during nuclear fission . </S>",
    "<S> this might be considered as the mesoscopic analog of the nuclear pasta postulated in the skins of neutron stars or supernovae @xcite . as discussed in a recent paper based on the use of energy density functionals to explore the cluster to liquid phase transition in nucleonic matter , larger pasta(or crystalline ) structures </S>",
    "<S> are not expected in finite nuclei @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> second , clusterization effects such as those manifested here should not be restricted to fission necks but should be a general property of nuclei , which are leptodermous systems , and therefore clusterization in the lower density skin may modify the skin properties . </S>",
    "<S> thus quantitative analyses of the data on skin thicknesses may require that the correlations which lead to the cluster formation be included . </S>",
    "<S> this could have an effect on analyses presently being carried out to extract information on the slope of the symmetry potential near normal density , for example @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> third , the derived fit parameters imply that the light particle or fragment accompanied ternary fission occurs on a time scale which is long compared to calculated saddle to scission times and thus may belong to the very slow fission components revealed by several fission time measurements @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to have experimental data on this point .    </S>",
    "<S> fourth , we note that data and analyses of the type considered here provide additional access to a low density , low temperature region of the nuclear phase diagram which can provide useful tests for modeling astrophysical phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analogous analyses of neck emission particles from peripheral and semi - peripheral reactions could allow studying the process at higher temperatures and following the cluster formation process in greater detail . </S>"
