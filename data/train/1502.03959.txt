    "the discovery of the higgs boson at atlas and cms experiments @xcite made a revolutionary impact on the field of particle physics .",
    "it not only confirmed the so - called higgs mechanism for the electroweak symmetry breaking , but also opened a new possibility to perform a precise test of the standard model ( sm ) by studying the properties of the higgs boson . in the sm ,",
    "the coupling constants of the higgs boson with other particles are well understood using the fact that the masses of quarks , leptons , and weak bosons originate in the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field , resulting in the prediction of the partial decay widths of the higgs boson into various particles .    in models with physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) ,",
    "measurements of the higgs couplings provide even exciting possibilities . in large class of bsm models",
    ", there exist new particles at the electroweak to tev scale , which affect the properties of the higgs boson .",
    "thus , with the detailed study of the higgs properties at collider experiments , we have a chance to observe a signal of bsm physics .",
    "such a study will be one of the major subjects in forthcoming collider experiments , i.e. , the lhc and future @xmath1 colliders like ilc and tlep @xcite .",
    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is a well - motivated candidate of bsm physics .",
    "compared to the sm , the particle content is enlarged in susy models . even in the minimal setup ,",
    "i.e. , in the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) , there exist two higgs doublets , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as superparticles .",
    "the lightest higgs boson @xmath10 , which plays the role of the `` higgs boson '' discovered by atlas and cms , is a linear combination of the neutral components of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while there exist other heavier higgses . in the case where the mass scales of the heavier higgses and the superparticles are high enough ,",
    "the properties of @xmath10 are close to those of the sm higgs boson . on the contrary , if the heavier higgses or superparticles are relatively light , deviations of the higgs properties from the sm predictions may be observed by future collider experiments . with the precise measurement of the partial decay widths ( or branching ratios ) of the higgs boson , information about the heavy higgses and/or superparticles",
    "may be obtained even if those heavy particles can not be directly discovered .    in this paper , we discuss how low the mass scales of the heavier higgs bosons and superparticles should be to observe a deviation . we evaluate the partial decay widths of the lightest higgs boson in the mssm , taking account of the following phenomenological constraints : higgs mass , flavor constraints of the @xmath11 mesons , stability of the electroweak ( sm - like ) vacuum against the transition to charge and color breaking ( ccb ) vacua , and perturbativity of coupling constants up to a high scale .",
    "these constraints exclude large fraction of the parameter region giving rise to a significant deviation .",
    "even so , we will see that the deviations of the partial widths from the sm predictions can be of @xmath12 for some of the decay modes in the parameter region allowed by the above - mentioned constraints .",
    "in particular , the deviations may be large enough to be observed by future future @xmath1 colliders like ilc and tlep even if superparticles are so heavy that they would not be observed at the lhc .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mssm ] , we briefly overview the properties of the higgs bosons in the mssm .",
    "we also summarize the phenomenological constraints that are taken into account in our analysis .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : width ] , we calculate the partial decay widths of the lightest higgs boson in the mssm and discuss how large the deviation from the sm prediction can be .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] is devoted for conclusions and discussion .",
    "we review some of the important properties of the higgs sector in the mssm .",
    "there are two higgs doublets , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "as the neutral components acquire vevs , the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) occurs .",
    "the ratio of the two higgs vevs is parameterized by @xmath13 . assuming no cp violation in the higgs potential , the mass eigenstates are classified as lighter and heavier cp - even higgs bosons ( denoted as @xmath10 and @xmath14 , respectively ) , cp - odd ( pseudo - scalar ) higgs @xmath15 , and charged higgs @xmath16 . in the following , we concentrate on the case where the masses of the heavier higgses ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) are much larger than the electroweak scale . then",
    ", the lightest higgs boson @xmath10 should be identified as the one observed by the lhc . on the other hand ,",
    "the masses of the heavier higgses are almost degenerate .",
    "we parameterize the heavier higgs masses using the pseudo - scalar mass @xmath17 .    at the tree level ,",
    "the lightest higgs mass is predicted to be smaller than the @xmath18-boson mass , while it is significantly pushed up by radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the mass matrix of the neutral cp - even higgs bosons is denoted as @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents radiative corrections .    at the one - loop level",
    ", the top - stop contribution dominates the radiative correction to the lightest higgs mass , and is approximated as @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the sm higgs vev , @xmath23 is the top - quark mass , @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the lighter and heavier stop masses , respectively ) , and @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the tri - linear scalar couplings for stop and the susy invariant higgsino mass parameter , respectively ) . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the convention of the slha format @xcite .",
    "the top - stop contribution can significantly enhance the lightest higgs mass .",
    "on the other hand , the bottom - sbottom contribution to the lightest higgs mass becomes sizable when the bottom yukawa coupling is large .",
    "it is likely to decrease the lightest higgs mass .",
    "when stop masses are @xmath30 , there are up to four solutions for @xmath28 to satisfy the observed value of the higgs mass @xmath31 , for which we use @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "let us call these four solutions as    * ns : negative @xmath28 with smaller @xmath33 , * nl : negative @xmath28 with larger @xmath33 , * ps : positive @xmath28 with smaller @xmath33 , * pl : positive @xmath28 with larger @xmath33 .",
    "assuming universal sfermion masses at the susy scale , the value of @xmath33 is typically a few times larger than the stop mass for nl and pl cases .",
    "such a large value of @xmath33 has significant phenomenological implications , as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "since the one - loop correction to the higgs mass is comparable to the tree - level value , higher order corrections are necessary to obtain reliable results .",
    "in particular , qcd correction , which appears at the two - loop level , and a large hierarchy between the susy scale and the electroweak scale require the resummation of the leading and sub - leading logarithms .",
    "we use feynhiggs 2.10.2 @xcite for the precise evaluation of the higgs masses ( as well as the mixing parameters and the partial decay widths of @xmath10 ) .    at the tree level , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) couples only to up - type quarks ( down - type quarks as well as leptons ) .",
    "however , this is not the case once radiative corrections due to superparticles are taken into account .",
    "the higgs couplings to bottom quark and tau lepton can be subject to sizable corrections even when susy breaking scale is very large .",
    "let us parameterize the effective @xmath34 and @xmath35 vertices including radiative corrections as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are right - handed bottom , right - handed top , and third - generation quark - doublets , respectively .",

    "<S> motivated by future collider proposals that aim to measure the higgs properties precisely , we study the partial decay widths of the lightest higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with an emphasis on the parameter region where all superparticles and heavy higgs bosons are not accessible at the lhc . taking account of phenomenological constraints such as the higgs mass , flavor constraints , vacuum stability , and perturbativity of coupling constants up to the grand unification scale , </S>",
