    "ordinary approach to quantum algorithm is based on quantum turing machine or quantum circuits @xcite .",
    "it is known that this approach  is not powerful enough to solve np - complete problems @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have proposed a new approach to quantum algorithm which goes beyond the standard quantum computation paradigm .",
    "this new approach is a sort of combination of the ordinary quantum algorithm and a chaotic dynamics .",
    "this approach was based on the results obtained in the paper @xcite .",
    "there are important problems such as the knapsack problem , the traveling salesman problem , the integer programming problem , the subgraph isomorphism problem , the satisfiability problem that have been studied for decades and for which all known algorithms have a running time that is exponential in the length of the input .",
    "these five problems and many other problems belong to the set of * np*-complete problems @xcite .",
    "many * np*-complete problems have been identified , and it seems that such problems are very difficult and probably exponential .",
    "if so , solutions are still needed , and in this paper we consider an approach to these problems based on quantum computers and chaotic dynamics as mentioned above .",
    "as in the previous papers @xcite  we again consider the satisfiability problem as an example of np - complete problems and argue that the problem , in principle , can be solved in polynomial time by using our new quantum algorithm .",
    "it is widely believed that quantum computers are more efficient than classical computers .",
    "in particular shor @xcite gave a remarkable quantum polynomial - time algorithm for the factoring problem .",
    "however , it is known that this problem is not * np*-complete but is np - intermidiate .",
    "since the quantum algorithm of the satisfiability problem ( sat for short ) has been considered in @xcite , accardi and sabbadini showed that this algorithm is combinatric one and they discussed its combinatric representation @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the sat problem can be solved in polynomial time by using a quantum computer under the assumption that a special superposition of two orthogonal vectors can be physically detected .",
    "the problem one has to overcome here is that the output of computations could be a very small number and one needs to amplify it to a reasonable large quantity .    in this paper",
    "we construct a new model ( representation ) of computations which combine ordinary quantum algorithm with a chaotic dynamical system and prove that one can solve the sat problem in polynomial time .    for a recent discussion of computational complexity in quantum computing see @xcite .",
    "mathematical features of quantum computing and quantum information theory are summarized in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a set .",
    "then @xmath1 and its negation @xmath2 @xmath3 are called literals and the set of all such literals is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the set of all subsets of @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 and an element @xmath7 is called a clause .",
    "we take a truth assignment to all variables @xmath8 if we can assign the truth value to at least one element of @xmath9 then @xmath10 is called satisfiable . when @xmath10 is satisfiable , the truth value @xmath11 of @xmath10 is regarded as true , otherwise , that of @xmath10 is false .",
    "take the truth values as true @xmath12 false@xmath13 then @xmath14    let @xmath15 be a boolean lattice with usual join @xmath16 and meet @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the truth value of a literal @xmath19 in @xmath20 then the truth value of a clause @xmath10 is written as    @xmath21    further the set @xmath22 of all clauses @xmath23 @xmath24 is called satisfiable iff the meet of all truth values of @xmath23 is 1 ;    @xmath25       thus the sat problem is written as follows :    sat problem : given a set @xmath0 and a set @xmath26 of clauses , determine whether @xmath22 is satisfiable or not .",
    "that is , this problem is to ask whether there exsits a truth assignment to make @xmath22 satisfiable .",
    "it is known@xcite in usual algorithm that it is polynomial time to check the satisfiability only when a specific truth assignment is given , but we can not determine the satisfiability in polynomial time when an assignment is not specified .",
    "note that a formula made by the product ( and @xmath27 ) of the disjunction ( or @xmath16 ) of literals is said to be in the _ product of sums _",
    "( pos ) form .",
    "for example , the formula @xmath28 is in pos form .",
    "thus a formula in pos form is said to be _",
    "satisfiable _ if there is an assignment of values to variables so that the formula has value 1 .",
    "therefore the sat problem can be regarded as determining _ whether or not a formula in pos form is satisfiable_.    the following analytical formulation of sat problem is useful .",
    "we define a family of boolean polynomials @xmath29 , indexed by the following data .",
    "one @xmath30 is a set @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath29 is defined as @xmath33 we assume here the addition modulo 2 .",
    "the sat problem now is to determine whether or not there exists a value of @xmath34 such that @xmath35",
    "although the quantum algorithm of sat problem is needed to add the dust bits to the input @xmath36 bits , the number of dust bites has been shown the order of @xmath37 @xcite . therefore for simplicity we will work in the @xmath38-tuple tensor product hilbert space @xmath39 @xmath40**c**@xmath41 in this paper with the computational basis @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 or @xmath45 we denote @xmath46 the quantum version of the function @xmath47",
    "is given by the unitary operator @xmath48 we assume that the unitary matrix @xmath49 can be build in the polynomial time , see @xcite .",
    "now let us use the usual quantum algorithm :    \\(i ) by using the fourier transform produce from @xmath50 the superposition @xmath51",
    "\\(ii ) use the unitary matrix @xmath49 to calculate @xmath52@xmath53 now if we measure the last qubit , i.e. , apply the projector @xmath54 to the state @xmath55 then we obtain that the probability to find the result @xmath56 is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of roots of the equation @xmath59 if @xmath58 is suitably large to detect it , then the sat problem is solved in polynominal time .",
    "however , for small @xmath60 the probability is very small and this means we in fact do nt get an information about the existence of the solution of the equation @xmath61 so that in such a case we need further deliberation .",
    "let us simplify our notations .",
    "after the step ( ii ) the quantum computer will be in the state @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are normalized @xmath36 qubit states and @xmath65 effectively our problem is reduced to the following @xmath66 qubit problem .",
    "we have the state @xmath67 and we want to distinguish between the cases @xmath68 and @xmath69(small positive number ) .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that quantum computer can speed up * np * problems quadratically but not exponentially .",
    "the no - go theorem states that if the inner product of two quantum states is close to 1 , then the probability that a measurement distinguishes which one of the two it is exponentially small .",
    "and one could claim that amplification of this distinguishability is not possible .    at this point",
    "we emphasize that we do not propose to make a measurement ( not read ) which will be overwhelmingly likely to fail .",
    "what we do it is a proposal to use the output @xmath70 of the quantum computer as an input for another device which uses chaotic dynamics in the sequel .    the amplification would be not possible if we use the standard model of quantum computations with a unitary evolution .",
    "however the idea of our paper is different .",
    "we propose to combine quantum computer with a chaotic dynamics amplifier .",
    "such a quantum chaos computer is a new model of computations going beyond usual scheme of quantum computation and we demonstrate that the amplification is possible in the polynomial time",
    ".    one could object that we dont suggest a practical realization of the new model of computations .",
    "but at the moment nobody knows of how to make a practically useful implementation of the standard model of quantum computing ever .",
    "quantum circuit or quantum turing machine is a mathematical model though convincing one .",
    "it seems to us that the quantum chaos computer considered in this paper deserves an investigation and has a potential to be realizable .    in this paper",
    "we propose a mathematical model of computations for solving sat problem by refining our previous paper @xcite .",
    "a possible specific physical implementation of quantum chaos computations with some error correction will be discussed in a separate paper @xcite , which is some how related to the recently proposed atomic quantum computer @xcite .",
    "various aspects of classical and quantum chaos have been the subject of numerious studies , see @xcite and ref s therein.the investigation of quantum chaos by using quantum computers has been proposed in @xcite . here",
    "we will argue that chaos can play a constructive role in computations .",
    "chaotic behaviour in a classical system usually is considered as an exponential sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "it is this sensitivity we would like to use to distinquish between the cases @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the previous section .",
    "consider the so called logistic map which is given by the equation @xmath71 .\\ ] ]    the properties of the map depend on the parameter @xmath72 if we take , for example , @xmath73 then the lyapunov exponent is positive , the trajectory is very sensitive to the initial value and one has the chaotic behaviour @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that if the initial value @xmath74 then @xmath75 for all @xmath76    it is known @xcite that any classical algorithm can be implemented on quantum computer .",
    "our quantum chaos computer will be consisting from two blocks .",
    "one block is the ordinary quantum computer performing computations with the output @xmath77 .",
    "the second block is a computer performing computations of the _ classical _ logistic map .",
    "this two blocks should be connected in such a way that the state @xmath78 first be transformed into the density matrix of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are projectors to the state vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 this connection is in fact nontrivial and actually it should be considered as the third block .",
    "one has to notice that @xmath80 and @xmath81 generate an abelian algebra which can be considered as a classical system . in the second block the density matrix @xmath84 above",
    "is interpreted as the initial data @xmath85 , and we apply the logistic map as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the identity matrix and @xmath88 is the z - component of pauli matrix on @xmath89 this expression is different from that of our first paper @xcite . to find a proper value @xmath90 we finally measure the value of @xmath88 in the state @xmath91 such that",
    "@xmath92    after simple computation we obtain    @xmath93    thus the question is whether we can find such a @xmath90 in polynomial steps of @xmath94satisfying the inequality @xmath95 for very small but non - zero @xmath96 here we have to remark that if one has @xmath68 then @xmath97 and we obtain @xmath98 for all @xmath99 if @xmath100 the stochastic dynamics leads to the amplification of the small magnitude @xmath101 in such a way that it can be detected as is explained below . the transition from @xmath85 to @xmath91",
    "is nonlinear and can be considered as a classical evolution because our algebra generated by @xmath81 and @xmath80 is abelian.the amplification can be done within atmost 2n steps due to the following propositions . since @xmath102 is @xmath103 of the logistic map @xmath104 with @xmath105 we use the notation @xmath103 in the logistic map for simplicity .",

    "@xmath120 for any @xmath128 thus there exists @xmath90 in @xmath115 satisfying @xmath129    let @xmath107 and @xmath36 be the same in the above proposition .",

    "we have also to consider the number of steps @xmath90 in the classical algorithm for the logistic map performed on quantum computer .",
    "it is the probabilistic part of the construction and one has to compute several times to be able to distingish the cases @xmath68 and @xmath148 thus it concludes that the quantum chaos algorithm can solve the sat problem in polynominal time according to the above propositions .    in conclusion , in this paper the quantum chaos algorithm is proposed .",
