    "fe - mn - al - c based steels have recently attracted close attention because of their high strength and ductility @xcite along with a high corrosion resistance and a comparably low density @xcite .",
    "this combination of their properties makes them also attractive for automotive applications .",
    "the excellent mechanical performance of the fe - mn - al - c steels is mainly attributed to microstructure features that correlate with deformation mechanisms and strongly depend on the amount of al in the material .",
    "high - mn steels with a low al content ( @xmath2 5 wt.% ) typically undergo a microstructure refinement by the activation of deformation twinning in the austenite phase , which increases the strain - hardening rate @xcite . when the al content in these steels ( about 30 wt.% mn and 1.3 wt.% c ) is higher than 6 wt.% , an annealing produces finely dispersed nano - sized @xmath0 carbides ( fe , mn)@xmath1alc in the austenitic matrix .",
    "experiments showed that these precipitates strengthen fe - mn - al - c steels , thereby making them interesting for applications .",
    "for example , the large age - hardenability of these alloys is attributed to the homogeneous precipitation and dispersion of @xmath0 carbides in the austenitic matrix @xcite .    using specific heat treatments , a @xmath3 regular microstructure",
    "can be achieved , which strongly influences the ductility at ambient temperatures @xcite .",
    "further , @xmath0 carbides improve the creep resistance of fe - based alloys at high temperatures making them desirable materials for manufacturing high - temperature components such as gas turbine blades and vanes in aircraft engines , aerospace and power generating plants .",
    "the presence of nano - sized @xmath0 carbides therefore yields mechanical properties of fe - based alloys that are similar to ni - based superalloys @xcite , provided the desired microstructure is achieved .",
    "the arrangement of @xmath0 carbides within the microstructure is to a large extent determined by the e2@xmath4 crystal structure of @xmath0 carbide .",
    "it resembles a perovskite - type cubic structure with al atoms at the corners of the cube , fe atoms at the face - centered sites ( corresponding to l1@xmath5 ) , and c atoms at the body - center octahedral site ( also called l@xmath61@xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , the nominal composition is fe@xmath1alc .",
    "experiments for high - mn alloys indicate that there can be a significant manganese content replacing the fe atoms , yielding a ( fe , mn)@xmath1alc composition@xcite . while different ordered e2@xmath4 structures for varying mn contents",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "1 , it is still unclear which mn content would correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium , how relevant the ordering is , and how this affects the mechanical properties .",
    "the orientation relationship between the regularly arranged @xmath0 carbides and the @xmath7 matrix is reported to be ( 001)/(001 ) in experiments @xcite .",
    "the interfaces are coherent in case of @xmath0 nano - precipitates without indications of misfit dislocations .",
    "such a microstructure can , however , not be understood if a completely stoichiometric composition is assumed .",
    "as the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations performed in this paper show , a nominal e2@xmath8 structure would have its elastically hard axis in the ( 001 ) direction and the resulting misfit of 9% with respect to the lattice constant of the matrix material would be too large , to ensure coherent interfaces . indeed , electron microprobe experiments have shown considerable deviations from the fe@xmath1alc stoichiometry . in an experimental work done by palm _",

    "the computation of the elastic constants of @xmath0 carbides has revealed that these carbides are more rigid than the parental fe@xmath1al - l1@xmath5 structure @xcite . in the same work ,",
    "the issue of different chemical configurations has been discussed for the fe - mn sublattice by considering ( fe@xmath15mn@xmath16)alc with integral values for @xmath17 from 0 to 3 . in a subsequent work by the same group @xcite , low mn concentrations in @xmath0 carbides",

    "a previous work further indicates the relevance of point defects such as c vacancies ( treated in the dilute limit ) for the thermodynamic stability of the relevant phases @xcite .",
    "while these studies provided important insight into the structure and thermodynamics , none of them fully explained the above mentioned c reduction of @xmath0 carbides . as we will show in the present study",
    ", this is mainly due to the geometrical constraints of a coherent interface to the matrix material .    in our first _ ab initio _",
    "study of @xmath0 carbides @xcite , we have already been able to reveal and explain the al depletion in these carbides by coherency strains .",
    "we have pointed out that this effect alone is not sufficient , but that it occurs concurrently with a reduced c content in these precipitates . in the present work",
    ", we now provide a deeper theoretical understanding of the c concentration in off - stoichiometric @xmath0 carbides , which is benchmarked against experimental data .",

    "nevertheless , our study supports those experiments @xcite that do not observe any macroscopic magnetic order in @xmath0 carbides at room temperature .",

    "this goes beyond what is currently feasible for a complex alloy like the @xmath0 carbides .",

    "however , the experimental findings provided above clearly indicate that the c off - stoichiometry is strongly related to the microstructure .",
    "the main difference between gi and gb precipitates is the coherency to the matrix material .",
    "we argue that the strain caused by the degree of coherency drives the c out of the carbide .",
    "the coherency is related to the lattice parameter mismatch between @xmath0 carbides and the @xmath7 matrix material . for the experimentally observed orientation relationship ( 001)/(001 ) , this misfit is obtained from our dft calculations to be in the stoichiometric case as high as 9% .",

    "synchrotron diffraction experiments ( not shown here ) have indicated a reduction in the lattice misfit to 1.4% between off - stoichiometric @xmath0 carbide and @xmath7 matrix in the grain interior . in order to enforce a completely coherent interface without misfit dislocations ,",

    "this observation together with the large misfit of 9% makes the stabilization of an ( 001)/(001 ) very unlikely , in puzzling disagreement with experiment .",
    "a reduction of the c content is expected to yield a smaller misfit .",
    "the question is , however , how it influences the elastic properties .",

    "the al ordering , which is used in this work to define the region of @xmath0 carbide , is volume conserving , while the c partitioning is not . since the coherency condition prevents any release of elastic energy by plastic relaxation via misfit dislocations at the interface , partitioning unavoidably increases the misfit and thus the elastic energy .",
    "this mechanism prevents a complete filling of the al - ordered region ( i.e. the @xmath0 carbide ) with c.    these considerations show that the required energy minimization also needs to take the chemical and elastic energy of the @xmath7 matrix into account . in principle , we should determine the volume dependent c solubility in a disordered fe - al - mn matrix . as mentioned in sec .",
