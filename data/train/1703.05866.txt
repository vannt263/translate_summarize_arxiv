    "the rapid advances in experimental techniques open the door to the search for exotic phases and in probing their quantum critical behaviors .",
    "one of the most striking experiments is the observation of the superfluid - mott transition in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "recently , by using the lattice shaking technique , the effective hopping parameters can be tuned to be negative or even complex  @xcite . as a result",
    ", lattice bosons with frustrated hoppings and/or coupled to artificial gauge fields have now been realized , which can give rise to unconventional superfluid ( sf ) phases  @xcite .",
    "besides the sf phases , intriguing supersolid ( ss ) states , which simultaneously possesses superfluid and solid long - range orders , can occur when intersite repulsions among lattice bosons are not negligible  @xcite .",
    "such phases usually come out around the phase boundary of commensurate solid phases and behave as intermediate states between the superfluid and the crystalline ones .",
    "dipolar quantum gases in optical lattices provide one of possible candidates in simulating this quantum phase  @xcite .",
    "the late realization of the bose - hubbard model with additional nearest - neighbour interactions ( i.e. , the so - called extended bose - hubbard model ) for magnetic erbium atoms lays the groundwork along this direction  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the ss phases are observed experimentally in atomic quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice inside a high - finesse optical cavity  @xcite .",
    "they are stabilized by the long - range interaction mediated by a vacuum mode of the cavity .",
    "more exotic states of matter are expected when one incorporates the hopping frustration into dipolar lattice gases . to uncover the interesting physics of such systems , an extended bose - hubbard model with a frustrated next - nearest - neighbor tunneling on square lattices",
    "is investigated recently  @xcite . in the hard - core limit",
    ", the grand - canonical hamiltonian reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 indicates the nearest- and @xmath2 next - nearest neighbors .",
    "the destruction ( creation ) operators of hard - core bosons on site @xmath3 are denoted by @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping integrals , respectively .",

    "when @xmath12 , the hopping frustration appears .    in ref .   where the frustrated case with @xmath12 is considered , by using the tensor network state method  @xcite , a peculiar half supersolid ( hss ) phase is found to appear away from half - filling for large @xmath8 and modest @xmath13",
    "its stabilization results from the interplay of the frustrated nnn hopping and the nn repulsion .",
    "this hss state is characterized by the preferential superfluid flow along the nnn bonds and nonzero bose - einstein condensate mainly on one sublattice .",
    "in addition , the particle density shows a checkerboard long - range order .",
    "the lattice s translational symmetry is thus spontaneously broken . a phase separation regime consisting of the uniform sf and the hss phases",
    "is observed in their fixed - density models  @xcite .",
    "this implies a first - order phase transition between these two phases .    actually , the non - frustrated nnn hopping ( @xmath14 ) can support as well a similar supersolid phase possessing both the sf and the checkerboard crystalline long - range orders  @xcite",
    "the appearance of such a checkerboard supersolid ( css ) state for the postive-@xmath15 case has been demonstrated by means of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "in contrast to the the negative-@xmath15 case , the sf - css phase transitions are however found to be of second - order  @xcite , instead of being discontinuous .    in this paper",

    "we note that the main difference between two supersolid states , the hss and the css states , comes from the distinct momentum states at which bosons condenses . depending on the sign of @xmath15 ,",
    "bose condensate in the hss phase occurs at the state with momenta @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but at @xmath18 in the css phase .",

    "besides the uniform sf and the supersolid phases , there exists as well an incompressible checkerboard solid ( cbs ) state at half - filling [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : phases](c ) ] .",
    "this solid state breaks as well the lattice s translational symmetry and is signaled by a plateau in the density profile versus chemical potential .",
    "various transitions between these quantum phases are summarized in fig .",

    ", we find that the sf - hss transitions are of first order , while the sf - css transitions are continuous . in contrast",
    ", both transitions from each supersolid phase to the cbs phase are shown to be continuous and belong to the superfluid - insulator universality class  @xcite . according to our cmf results ,",
    "the stability of the two supersolid phases is enhanced when the nn repulsion @xmath8 and the magnitude of the nnn hopping @xmath15 are increased .",
    "since the model under consideration lies within the reach of present experimental setup , hopefully our predictions may be realized in the near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the cluster mean - field theory is briefly described and the measured order parameters are introduced .",
    "our numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "we summarize our work in sec .  iv .",
    "our calculations are performed by using the cluster mean - field ( cmf ) theory  .",
    "it has several different names in the literature : cluster gutzwiller approach  @xcite , hierarchical mean - field approach  @xcite , and composite boson mean - field approach  @xcite .",
    "this method has been shown to be an extremely efficient way of exploring vast uncharted territory in the phase diagram .",
    "because short - range correlations within the cluster are taken into account exactly , the cmf method can give far more precise results than conventional single - site mean - field approaches . under a scaling of the cluster sizes , even the accurate phase boundaries for infinite lattices",
    "may be achieved  @xcite .    in the cmf theory",
    ", the whole system is decomposed into a cluster of lattice sites and its surroundings , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmf ] .",
    "the interaction between these two parts is approximated by the mean fields at the borders of the cluster .",

    "such mean - field decoupling amounts to the approximation of the many - body wave function being written as a product of the cluster and the environment wave functions .",

    "[ fig : phases ] ) , states with a four - sublattice structure are considered in the present work . assuming the mean fields @xmath28 to be real , there are thus eight mean - field parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , in total . under this four - sublattice pattern ,",
    "a cluster of @xmath31 sites is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmf ] . the mean fields",
    "to which the cluster is coupled are then calculated by averaging over all sites belonging to the same sublattice . in some cases , this prescription can prevent possible numerical instability happened in other proposals  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : phase_dia ] are obtained by means of the cmf approach using @xmath32 clusters .",
    "we note that the phase boundaries will be slightly affected upon increasing the cluster sizes , since longer - ranged many - particle correlations can be incorporated . by applying a cluster - size scaling , the phase transition points for an infinite lattice",
    "can be extrapolated  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we take the scaling parameter @xmath33 introduced in refs .   and  .",
    "here , @xmath34 denotes the number of the nn bonds within the cluster and @xmath35 is the coordination number for the lattice ( @xmath36 for the present case of square lattice ) . because the denominator represents the number of the nn bonds of the original lattice per @xmath30 sites , the parameter @xmath37 provides an indication of how much the correlation effects between particles are considered in the cluster .",
    "the infinite - size limit thus corresponds to @xmath38 . in the next section , linear extrapolations toward @xmath38 for some typical phase transition points",

    "this can be detected by nonzero values of the fourier transform of the local densities @xmath48 , @xmath49 its value at @xmath42 is nothing but the averaged density . in the thermodynamic limit , this quantity has a direct relation , @xmath50 , to the static structure factor @xmath51 . for systems with the cbs order , @xmath52 is expected . in particular , the classical picture of the incompressible cbs state at half - filling predicts @xmath53 .    besides , in order to determine possible first - order phase transitions signaled by energy level crossing  @xcite",

    "we note that double counting terms coming from the mean - field decoupling of two - cluster interactions must be subtracted .",
    "this explains the occurrence of the second term in eq .  .",

    "[ fig : phase_dia ] , the hss phase for @xmath84 exists in larger parameter regions than the css phase for @xmath14 does .",

    "when @xmath96 , the uniform sf phase becomes absent and the hss phase can exist for all incommensurate fillings .",
    "this can be understood from the single - particle dispersion relation , which has local minima at @xmath97 and @xmath98 when @xmath96 .",
    "this thus favors the bose condensation consistent with the sf order in the hss state , rather than the uniform sf one .",
    "using the cluster mean - field theory , we explored in detail the formation of two supersolid phases , which arise in the hard - core extended boson hubbard model of eq .  .",
    "we find that , in the presence of a large nn repulsion , by introducing a modest nnn hopping @xmath15 , either the css or the hss phases can be stabilized away from half - filling .",
    "both supersolid phases come out around the phase boundary of the cbs phase and behave as intermediate states between the sf and the cbs states . despite carrying the same checkerboard crystalline long - range order ,",
    "bosons condense at different momentum states in these two supersolid phases , as shown in our calculations .",
    "the characters of various phase transitions out of the css or the hss states are discussed .",
    "their transitions to the cbs state are found to be continuous and belong to the sf - insulator universality class  @xcite .",
    "however , for the frustrated case with @xmath84 , the sf - hss transition is shown to be of first order , instead of being continuous observed at the sf - css transition for the @xmath14 case .",
    "the distinct nature of these two phase transitions can be understood from their different condensation patterns .",
    "while only the model of hard - core bosons is considered in this work , similar phenomena are expected as well when the hard - core constraint is replaced by a finite but strong on - site repulsion .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the realization of the extended bose - hubbard model has been achieved recently  @xcite and frustrated tunnelings can be produced by , say , lattice shaking techniques  @xcite .",
    "that is , the model discussed here lies within the reach of current experimental setup .",
