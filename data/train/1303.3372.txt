    "coronal dimming regions analysed by former studies showed mass outflows lasting for hours @xcite and thus it is likely that they provide the cme with material also in its later evolution . @xcite already pointed out this effect to explain the backward ( relative to the cme front ) motion of the cme center of mass as the event expands in the outer corona .",
    "+ the behavior of the center of mass of the cme during its evolution should clarify which of the processes described above is responsible for the real cme mass increase observed . in case of pile up",
    ", more cme material accumulates at the front of the cme and the center of mass is expected to move toward the cme leading edge with time .",
    "if there is a mass flow from behind , the center of mass would drop backward with time . from the cor2 observations of our events we calculated for each time step the center of mass position within the defined cme sector following @xcite .",
    "the distance of the center of mass to the sun center is then plotted together with the height of the cme leading edge , which we consider as the outer boundary of the modeled cme flux rope ( cf .",
    "the inner boundary of the flux rope was calculated by the width derived from the forward modeling .",
    "the distance of both boundaries ( black solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fl ] ) increases because of the self - similar expansion of the flux rope .",
    "because a significant fraction of the flux rope is occulted in the beginning of the cme evolution , the center of mass was not measured until the full flux rope could be observed , i.e.  the height of its inner boundary is larger than the effective occultation size ( indicated by the shaded area below the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fl ] indicates with grey lines steps of 10% of the width of the cme body . from this",
    "we obtain that on average , the center of mass lies on the 25% line and shifts with 5@xmath167% towards the inner boundary of the flux rope . for 14 events",
    "the center of mass moved with more than @xmath64 of the flux rope width toward the inner boundary ( mass flow ) , in 2 cases we measured a motion over 510% of the cme width toward the outer boundary ( pile up ) . for 7 cases",
    "the center of mass motion relative to the cme leading edge remains roughly constant ( i.e.  changes are @xmath65 of the flux rope width ) and for 2 events we can not make a clear statement . therefore , we find that mass flow behind the cme is the main reason for the mass increase .",
    "+ prominences , which are often related to cmes , can also influence the cme mass measurements . in some cases",
    "their bright h@xmath66 radiation can be observed in white light coronagraphic observations . when this radiation is wrongly interpreted as thomson scattering ,",
    "excessive mass values are obtained .",
    "@xcite explained the short - time increase and decrease of mass in the cor1 measurements of their event under study by this phenomenon .",
    "therefore we took special care to exclude events which showed h@xmath66 radiation in the coronagraphic observations .",
    "nevertheless h@xmath66 emission could be one reason for the differences in the mass increases derived from the cor2 fit and the combined cor1/cor2 fit ( see for example 2010 august 27 in fig .",
    "[ fits ] ) .",
    "scattering effects of the cor1 instrument or mass draining down before it reaches the cor2 fov can also lead to larger mass measurements in the cor1 fov .",
    "coronal disturbances , e.g.  other cmes , background streamers or particles produced by a solar flare and hitting the detector may influence cor1 measurements as well as cor2 measurements .",
    "the observed cme mass evolution in coronagraphic observations is easily explained by the ` true ' mass evolution and a geometrical effect . we derived a fit function , which enables us to consider both components separately . by this",
    "` true ' mass values at every height , between the effective occultation size and 20  r@xmath0 , can be estimated . for the majority of the events we find a significant cme mass increase , which is in the range of 2 to 6% and becomes most important over the distance range 1020  r@xmath0 .",
    "we find that most of the mass is located in the rear part of the cme body and , in about half of the events , there is strong evidence that the derived mass increase is supplied to the back of the cme by enhanced flow from the low corona due to temporary coronal holes created by the cme eruption .",
