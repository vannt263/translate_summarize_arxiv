    "the conventional astronomical picture for the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays , namely proton acceleration to high energy in extra - galactic objects , predicts a sharp suppression of the cosmic - ray flux beyond the greissen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff at @xmath10 ev ( greisen 1966 ; zatsepin & kuzmin 1996 ) , due to interaction of protons with photons of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the absence of a gzk cutoff might suggest the presence of a new source of ultra - high energy cosmic rays , possibly related to the decay of exotic particles ( see cronin 1996 ; hillas 1998 for reviews ) .",
    "the suppression of flux beyond the gzk cutoff is most often discussed assuming a uniform source distribution .",
    "however , the distribution of other astrophysical systems ( e.g. galaxies , clusters of galaxies ) is inhomogeneous on scales of tens of mpc , comparable to the propagation distance of protons of energy @xmath11  ev .",
    "therefore , significant deviations from the predictions for a uniform distribution may be expected beyond the gzk cutoff ( giller , wdowczyk & wolfendale 1980 ; hill & schramm 1985 ; waxman 1995 ) .",
    "there are at least two possible approaches to evaluating the effects of source inhomogeneity on the energy spectrum and spatial direction of high energy cosmic rays . in the first approach",
    ", one assumes that the source density of ultra - high energy cosmic rays is proportional to ( possibly with some bias factor ) the galaxy density in some particular survey of the distribution of relatively nearby galaxies .",
    "this approach has been used by waxman , fisher & piran ( 1997 ) ; giller , wdowczyk & wolfendale ( 1980);and hill & schramm ( 1985 ) and illustrates some of the principal features of source clustering . in the present paper",
    ", we adopt a different and complimentary approach .",
    "we use an analytic model that summarizes the clustering properties of the unknown source of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays by a single parameter , @xmath4 , the correlation length .",
    "the analytic model that we adopt has the advantage of generality .",
    "no specific source population has to be assumed .",
    "also , the results of source clustering on the energy spectrum and on the spatial distribution of the highest energy cosmic rays can be summarized in terms of the single unknown correlation length of the source population , @xmath4 .",
    "thus the correlation length provides a concise and simple characterization of measurable clustering effects on observational parameters for high energy cosmic rays .",
    "future experiments that measure the arrival directions of a large number of high energy cosmic rays will determine @xmath4 and permit a clear assessment of whether or not the departures from expectations based upon a homogeneous source distribution can plausibly be explained by any non - uniform population .",
    "the source correlation function , @xmath12 , is defined by an average over the observable universe volume , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the source density and brackets denote volume average .",
    "thus , the variance that we derive in the expected cosmic - ray number due to source clustering is , strictly speaking , the variance of the distribution of cosmic - ray number observed by observers randomly distributed over the universe .",
    "this is the best that one can do , but it is not exactly what we we want .",
    "we really want the variance in conceivable realizations of the universe in our vicinity .",
    "however , we show in  2 that the distance from our galaxy over which sources contribute to the observed flux above @xmath2  ev is @xmath15  mpc ( see fig .",
    "since the clustering properties of astronomical objects ( e.g. galaxies ) within this volume are similar to that obtained by averaging over larger volumes ( e.g. peebles 1999 ) , we expect our result to provide a reasonable approximation for the variance in the number of cosmic - rays observed at earth due to different realizations of cosmic - ray source distributions that satisfy the universal clustering properties of the sources .",
    "one may argue that a more accurate estimate of the variance can be derived by the using known galaxy catalogs to model the effects of source inhomogeneity .",
    "however , in order to use such an approach one must choose a specific model to derive the probability of a given cosmic - ray source distribution under the constraints provided by a given galaxy catalog .",
    "the variance calculated in this approach would depend primarily on the resultant cosmic - ray source correlation function . while this correlation function would indeed depend on the clustering properties of the particular galaxies chosen , it would be strongly dependent on the assumed model .",
    "it should be emphasized here that one does not known which particular rare sub - population of the total observed galaxy population actually produces the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "the local density of field galaxies is of order @xmath16 , whereas the local density of sources of uhe cosmic rays may be as low as @xmath17 .",
    "( the lower limit to the source density is set by the requirement that at least a few sources exist out to a distance of @xmath18 in order to account for the observed events above @xmath19 . )",
    "thus , results derived in this approach would not yield a more accurate estimate of the variance , but rather reflect the assumptions under which the cosmic - ray source distribution is constrained given some chosen galaxy catalog .",
    "moreover , even after one makes a specific assumption about the functional relation between the density of sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays and an observed sample of galaxies , one has to perform and analyze many monte carlo simulations with galaxy catalogs in order to determine the statistical effects on the observed characteristics of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "we believe therefore that the simplicity and conciseness of the analytic model approach justifies its application , as one of the possible approaches , to the evaluation of the effects of source inhomogeneity .    in this paper we consider the implications of clustering of cosmic - rays sources , adopting the conventional picture of protons as the ultra - high energy(uhe ) cosmic - rays .",
    "we assume that the correlation function between the sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays has the same functional form as for galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and quasars , but we do not require  as was done in previous work ( waxman , fisher & piran 1997 ; giller , wdowczyk & wolfendale 1980 ; hill & schramm 1985)that the distribution of cosmic ray sources be the same as for nearby galaxies . as described above",
    ", the conditions that must be satisfied in order to produce ultra - high energy cosmic rays are so exceptional that the spatial distribution of sources of uhe cosmic rays could be very different than the distribution of average , nearby galaxies like the iras sources discussed in waxman , fisher & piran ( 1997 ) .",
    "also , we are primarily concerned in this paper with the energy spectrum of uhe cosmic rays , whereas the iras galaxy distribution was used in waxman , fisher & piran ( 1997 ) to discuss their possible angular distribution on the sky .",
    "our principal result is that the standard deviation due to clustering , @xmath20 , in the number of cosmic rays detected above energy @xmath21 is proportional to the number , @xmath22 , predicted for a uniform source density .",
    "this behavior contrasts with the standard deviation due to shot noise , which becomes proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "the constant of proportionality between @xmath24 and @xmath25 depends upon energy and is calculated in section 2 . for @xmath26",
    "ev , the constant of proportionality between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is of order unity for plausible values of the correlation length , @xmath4 , of the correlation function of the sources of the uhe cosmic rays .",
    "anisotropies in the source distribution on a scale of @xmath27 should be detectable in the angular distribution of @xmath28  ev cosmic rays with the high rates that will be observed in the hires ( corbato et al .",
    "1992 ) , the auger ( cronin 1992 ; watson 1993 ) and the telescope array ( teshima 1992 ) experiments . unlike the predictions of many particle - physics explanations ( for recent reviews see berezinsky 1998 ; bhattacharjee 1998 ) of the fly s eye ( bird et al .",

    "; takeda et al . 1998 ) results , no characteristic dependence on galactic coordinates is expected on the basis of this conventional extragalactic scenario .",
    "the computed large value of @xmath24 reflects the fact that the universe , and hence the uhe source population , is inhomogeneous over distances comparable to the mean free path of uhe protons that move through the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 can not be reduced by observing longer or doing different experiments .",
    "we only have one `` nearby universe '' and we do not know _ a priori _ the local clustering properties of the sources of uhe cosmic rays .",
    "the angular scale of anisotropies due to magnetic scattering of uhe cosmic rays from individual sources is smaller than what is expected from the clustering of the sources themselves unless the inter - galactic field is close to the maximum value allowed with the available data on faraday rotation .",
    "the upper limit on the contribution of an inter - galactic magentic field to the farady rotation of distant sources , rm@xmath30 for sources at @xmath31 ( valle 1990 ) , implies an upper limit @xmath32  g on a uniform inter - galactic field , and an upper limit @xmath33 on a field with correlation length @xmath34 .",
    "and we choose @xmath35 , corresponding to @xmath36 , while valle assumed @xmath37 .",
    "our upper limit is much smaller than that recently claimed by farrar & piran ( 2000 ) , mainly due to the fact that they use older radio data ( kronberg & simard - normandin 1976 ) for which the rm upper limit for @xmath31 sources is weaker , rm@xmath38 , and assume that the free electron density is only @xmath39 of the baryon density . ]",
    "a simple random walk calculation shows that the upper limit on @xmath40 sets an upper limit to the magnetic deflections , @xmath41 for propagation distance @xmath42 .",
    "than the upper limit of @xmath43  g on a volume filling field , where @xmath44 is the fraction of the volume occupied by large scale filaments and sheets .",
    "this is due to the fact that the upper limit is inversly proportional to the electron density , @xmath45 , and propotional to the square root of the path length @xmath46 of light through magnetized plasma .",
    "while this reduction of the upper limit may be partly compensated by assuming strong negative evolution of the magnetic field with redhsift ( e.g. farrar & piran 2000 ) , the assumption that the inter - galactic magnetic field is confined to large - scale structires does not lead to increase in the upper limit on the deflection of uhe cosmic rays . ] galactic magnetic fields contribute only relatively small deflections .",
    "we present our principal results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : discussion ] that the large value of @xmath29 is important for the interpretation of the existing agasa and fly s eye experiments .",
    "we also list in section  [ sec : discussion ] the effects of clustering that may be detectable with the hires , auger project , and the telescope array experiment .",
    "the number , @xmath1 , of high - energy cosmic rays predicted on average above a threshold energy @xmath21 is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the probability that a proton created at @xmath49 with energy @xmath50 arrives at earth with an energy above threshold .",

    "the energy loss in a single pair production interaction is small , of order @xmath66 , and for protons at energy @xmath67  ev the characteristic energy loss time due to this interaction is comparable to the hubble time , @xmath68  yr ( blumenthal 1970 ) .",

    "no matter how one combines the experiments and the smooth models , there is not a @xmath137 discrepancy with the conventional picture of protons as the source of ultra - high energy cosmic rays . if one considers , as many recent authors have done , only the agasa data , then @xmath138 and for @xmath53 , @xmath139 , and @xmath135 , which is a @xmath140 discrepancy .",
    "on the basis of the available evidence , we conclude that new particles are not required to explain the observed cosmic ray energy spectrum .    however , a number of authors have interpreted the same data as suggesting the possibility that new particles are producing the highest energy cosmic rays ( for a recent discussion and review of this point of view see ellis 1999 and the references contained therein )",
    ". one of the principal reasons for the difference in conclusions is the uncertainty over whether the extrapolation of the ` conventional high energy component ' should be made using @xmath141 , as we have done , or whether the fall - off of the spectrum at energies just below the gzk cutoff is stronger , e. g. , @xmath108 .",
    "this is just one of the important questions that will have to be answered in the future by a much larger data set .",
    "we also note that preliminary results from the hires experiment were recently presented in a talk at taup99 ( matthews 1999 ) , reporting 7 events beyond @xmath2  ev for an exposure similar to that of the fly s eye .",
    "it is difficult to decide how this result should be interpreted , since the discrepancy between hires and fly s eye results is present not only above @xmath2  ev , but also at lower energy , where fly s eye , agasa and yakutsk experiments are in agreement : 13 events above @xmath142  ev are reported in the preliminary hires analysis , while only 5 events at that energy range are reported by fly s eye .",
    "we therefore believe that unambiguous conclusions based on the recent hires data can be drawn only after a complete analysis of the hires data is published ( which would include , e.g. , corrections due to realistic atmospheric conditions ) .",
    "one possible interpretation of the suggested excess of events beyond the gzk cutoff is that this may be a hint that ultra - high energy cosmic rays are produced by sources whose density in the nearby universe is somewhat higher than their average cosmological density .",
    "of course , other interpretations are possible , including the hypothesis  amply represented in the literature  that new physics is involved and that the gzk cutoff is bypassed by this new physics .",
    "if the gzk cutoff is ultimately convincingly measured , then the most likely explanation for the small number of already observed uhe cosmic rays will be the effects of source clustering .",
    "future measurements of high statistical significance with agasa , hires , auger and the telescope array are required to determine if source clustering affects significantly the observed number and angular distribution of uhe cosmic rays .",
