    "the @xmath1-function becomes positive indicating the increase of the coupling constant with the momentum . at two - loop order",
    "the @xmath1-function receives a contribution with a different signal as observed by caswell @xcite , and although at high momentum this contribution is perturbatively small for a small number of flavors , its effect is not trivial if this number is increased , leading to a zero of the @xmath1-function , and to the so - called banks - zaks ( bz ) fixed point @xcite .",
    "the importance of a non - trivial perturbative fixed point is not only related to the interest on the different qcd phases , but this fixed point may lead to a conformal window with possible interesting consequences for beyond standard model physics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-function above two loops is scheme dependent , and the existence of the banks - zaks fixed point has been tested perturbatively for qcd up to four loops and in different schemes @xcite .",
    "therefore the fixed point location , as a function of @xmath0 , has a small dependence on the renormalization scheme , in the order of perturbation theory that it was calculated , and , of course , the result can be considered reliable if the next orders are indeed smaller .",
    "this motivated the interest of lattice simulations , not only for qcd , but also in different non - abelian gauge theories , and with different fermionic representations in order to determine the existence ( or not ) of this fixed point ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . at four loops , as a function of @xmath0 and in the @xmath6 scheme , the qcd @xmath1-function for quarks in the fundamental representation is the following @xcite : ( a_s)=-b_0 a_s^2-b_1 a_s^3-b_2 a_s^4- b_3 a_s^5 + ( a_s^6 ) , [ betaper ] where @xmath7 and for su(3 ) b_0 & & 11 - 0.66667 n_f , + b_1 & & 102 - 12.6667 n_f , + b_2 & & 1428.50 - 279.611 n_f + 6.01852 n_f^2 , + b_3 & & 29243.0 - 6946.30 n_f + 405.089 n_f^2 , + & + & 1.49931 n_f^3 .",

    "the concept of an ir finite qcd effective charge even for a small number of quarks was also extensively discussed by grunberg @xcite , and , in particular , he has also made an interesting discussion about the relation of these effective charges with the conformal window originated through the banks - zaks expansion @xcite .",

    "some of the questions that we will discuss here include : 1 ) are the fixed points generated in these different approaches numerically similar ? 2 ) are the anomalous dimensions associated to these fixed points varying in the same way and with similar values ?",
    "3 ) if these fixed points are different for a given @xmath0 which one corresponds to a state of minimum energy ?    the possible existence of a dynamically generated gluon mass was for the first time determined by cornwall @xcite .",
    "since this seminal work there were many others showing in detail that it is possible to write the sde for the gluon propagator in a gauge invariant way @xcite , and from it obtain a dynamical gluon mass @xcite and a gauge invariant ir finite frozen coupling @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations are showing agreement with the sde @xcite .",
    "even if the lattice simulations are performed in one specific gauge , it has been shown how the coupling constant obtained in the gauge invariant sde approach can be translated to a specific gauge , for instance the landau gauge , and it was verified that the gap between the freezing values of the coupling constant obtained in different gauges can be explained @xcite . in section ii we will briefly discuss this effective charge and set the equations to show how it should vary with @xmath0 .",

    "iv we provide some arguments about which scenario is the one leading to the states of minimum of energy , or the one that should be chosen by nature . in section",
    "v we draw our conclusions . within the approximations of this work , which rely basically on extrapolations of the dynamical gluon masses at large @xmath0 , we can compare the different @xmath1 functions ( bz and dgm ) and their different fixed points , arguing that the state of minimum energy in qcd , as a function of the coupling constant and up to the critical value @xmath4 , are related to the dynamical gluon mass generation mechanism only above @xmath9 .",
    "dynamical gauge boson masses appear in non - abelian gauge theories as a consequence of the schwinger mechanism , according to which if the gauge boson vacuum polarization develops a pole at zero momentum transfer , the boson acquires a dynamical mass .",
    "the work of ref.@xcite was the first one to obtain a gauge invariant sde for the gluon propagator , verifying the existence of the schwinger mechanism in qcd .",
    "for this the introduction of the pinch technique was necessary , which combined with the background field method , leads to a particular truncation of the sde obeying abelian slavnov - taylor identities and to a gauge invariant gluon self - energy ( @xmath10 ) , allowing us to build a renormalization group invariant quantity @xmath11 , whose solution can be written as ^-1(k^2)= [ k^2+m_g^2 ( k^2)]\\ { _ 0 g^2 ( ) } , [ eqa1 ] where @xmath12 is the coupling constant , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 the dynamical gluon mass and @xmath16 is the characteristic qcd mass scale . the above equation can be recognized as the equivalent at ( large ) momentum space to the inverse of the qcd coulomb force , from where we can read the effective coupling constant g^2(k^2)==4_s ( k^2 ) , [ eq : coupling ] which match asymptotically with the perturbative coupling constant .",
    "several aspects of this mechanism are illustrated in refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively for the cases of qcd in four and three dimensions .",
    "a recent review about dynamical gluon mass generation can be found in ref.@xcite , which contains early references about this mechanism .",
    "perhaps the many technical details of the pinch technique and background field method hampered the dissemination of these results , but there is unequivocal evidence from large volume lattice simulations that the gluon acquires a dynamical mass @xcite , the results are fully consistent with the sde for the gluon propagator @xcite , and consistent with many phenomenological calculations that depend to some extent on the ir qcd behavior @xcite .",

    "note that a more detailed expression for the non - perturbative coupling constant and dynamical mass can be found in @xcite , however , for simplicity , we will continue to use eq.([eq : coupling ] ) which reflects the gross behavior of this qcd ir finite coupling .",

    "the fixed point of the non - perturbative @xmath1 function depends only on the @xmath21 ratio .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the dynamical gluon mass generation imply in the existence of a non - trivial fixed point @xcite , and more importantly : recently we verified that the qcd coupling of eq.([eq : coupling ] ) freezes in the infrared limit , when only three quarks are operative , at one relatively small value @xcite , and not too much different from the coupling values that would come out from the zeros of the perturbative @xmath1 function given by eq.([betaper ] ) at some large @xmath0 !",
    "this fact certainly justifies the comparison of the different mechanisms ( bz or dgm ) .",
    "moreover , this @xmath1 function may have an important consequence for the stability of the standard model @xcite . finally , to know how eq.([eq : betacornwall ] ) or eq.([eq : betamg_k2 ] ) vary with @xmath0 we must know how @xmath22 varies with this quantity .",
    "it has been observed in qcd lattice simulations that the dynamical gluon mass increases when @xmath0 increases @xcite .",
    "similar results were observed in the solution of the schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) for the gluon propagator including dynamical quarks @xcite .",
    "we can quote typical @xmath23 values of @xmath24 mev respectively for @xmath25 quarks @xcite .",

    "therefore we will conservatively assume that @xmath27 mev for @xmath28 .",
    "note that it is not difficult to understand why @xmath17 should increase with @xmath0 .",
    "when we increase the number of quarks we may expect that the strong force diminishes ( see , for instance , eq.([eqa1 ] ) ) , because of the screening proportioned by extra quark loops .",
    "this force should be , at least asymptotically , proportional to the product of the coupling constant times the gluon propagator .",
    "the coupling behaves as shown by eq.([eq : coupling ] ) and the propagator is roughly given by @xmath29 .",
    "the only way to decrease the force as @xmath0 is increased is with larger @xmath23 values .",
    "therefore , using the lattice data @xcite , we will assume the following different scaling laws to describe the dynamical gluon mass evolution as a function of @xmath0 : m_g^-1(n_f ) & = & m_g_0 ^ -1 ( 1-a_1 n_f)[eq : mglinearprd ] , + m_g^-1(n_f ) & = & m_g_0 ^ -1 e^-a_2 n_f[eq : mgexpprd ] , where @xmath30 varies between @xmath31 and @xmath26 mev and @xmath32 and @xmath33 . with the extreme @xmath30 values we obtain a band of possible @xmath1 function curves , reflecting the uncertainty in our knowledge about the dynamical gluon mass .",

    "their @xmath1 functions are quite similar and the fixed points occur at approximately the same coupling constant values for @xmath82 .",
    "however , as we vary @xmath0 the values of the coupling constants associated to the fixed points move in different directions : decreasing when @xmath0 increases in the bz approach , and exactly the opposite occurs in the dgm case .    both @xmath1 functions and their coupling constants up to the critical value that determine the fixed points are in agreement with the analyticity constraint , and",
    "if we assume that in both cases we can use perturbation theory to compute the anomalous dimension associated to each fixed point , we come to the conclusion that the dgm mechanism could be a possible explanation for the anomalous dimension and fixed points within the conformal window .    our results cover the following number of flavors @xmath83 . assuming that the gluon condensate can be calculated in terms of the non - perturbative gluon propagator and its dynamical gluon mass , we observe an intriguing behavior of the vacuum energy calculated as a function of the coupling constant up to the fixed point value : around @xmath2 it is the bz approach that leads to the deepest minimum of energy , which is at the border of the conformal window , and below this number of flavors the ",
    "perturbative \" vacuum becomes unstable , in the sense that when @xmath79 the bz @xmath1 function is not bounded from below .",
    "as we increase @xmath0 the vacuum energy is dominated by the dgm mechanism . at larger @xmath0 values",
    "the coupling constant in the dgm approach seems to increase to values where we can not be sure that the sde calculations of the dgm approach are still reliable .",
    "of course , in the dgm case we do have fixed points for a small number of quarks , and for a naive ( perturbative ) calculation of the mass anomalous dimension exponent we obtain @xmath56 in the range @xmath84 up to @xmath85 .",
    "if the fixed points predicted in the dgm approach are not confirmed by lattice simulations this means that the extrapolations shown in eqs . and are not correct or the @xmath1 function of eq .",
    "does not correspond to a true minimum of energy .",
    "it should be noted that we used simple approximations for the coupling constant ( eq.([eq : coupling ] ) ) , for the dynamical gluon mass behavior with the momentum ( eq.([eq : mg ] ) ) , for the dependence of this mass ( eq.([eq : mgexpprd ] ) ) and of the gluon condensate ( eq.([eq : gluoncondensate ] ) ) with the number of flavors .",
    "the dependence of these quantities with @xmath0 introduces some uncertainty in our calculation , which are difficult to be estimated , but shall not modify the main results and characteristics of the dgm mechanism .",
    "in particular , it has been strongly stressed how lattice simulations of the gluon propagator , and consequently the dynamical gluon mass ir value , demand simulations with quite large volume lattices @xcite .",
    "we also note that our calculation depends on the ratio @xmath21 , and the @xmath86 value will be dependent on the scheme and the number of fermions that we consider in order to obtain its physical value . if we consider recently reported @xmath87 determinations obtained in lattice simulations ( e.g. @xmath88 mev and @xmath89 mev @xcite ) , we can be confident that the uncertainty that we have in the @xmath17 determination exceed by far the one that we have for @xmath86 , and for this reason we stress that our result is quite dependent on the ratio @xmath21 and the main source of uncertainty resides in the @xmath17 variation with @xmath0 .",
    "we are comparing @xmath1 functions obtained in different schemes , and are assuming that their respective fixed points are relatively stable , making our comparison worthwhile . considering the proximity of the different fixed points , and their dependence with @xmath0 it would be important that such coincidence could be tested by different methods .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to have improved lattice calculations of the behavior of this quantity with large @xmath0 , mainly to check extrapolations like the ones of eq . and",
    "eq .. the same can also be said about calculations of the gluon condensate as a function of @xmath0 .",
