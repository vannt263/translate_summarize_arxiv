    "spatially extended chaotic systems ( secs ) are of great importance for the understanding of fundamental problems in deterministic many - particle systems , including hydrodynamics and turbulence  @xcite or weather forecasting  @xcite .",
    "these systems exhibit dynamical instabilities that can be quantified by the spectrum of lyapunov exponents and their corresponding lyapunov vectors ( lvs )  @xcite .",
    "recently , the application of some tools and concepts borrowed from the physics of nonequilibirum statistical systems has been shown to be a very promising line of research to study certain aspects of secs . in particular",
    ", it has been observed that ( after a suitable logarithmic transformation ) the evolution of an infinitesimal perturbation in deterministic secs can be generically described as a scale - invariant rough surface  @xcite . in this surface picture , the erratic fluctuations of the system , due to the chaotic dynamics , are interpreted as noise .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown  @xcite that in many cases the associated surfaces belong to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz )  @xcite universality class of nonequilibrium surface roughening .",
    "nonetheless , the probability distribution of the randomness generated by the chaotic trajectory can be crucial . in this regard",
    ", the existence of long - range correlations  @xcite or a fat tail of the distribution  @xcite may change the universality class observed in the surface growth picture .    typically the above discussed studies",
    "deal with _ homogeneous _ systems , where only identical elements are coupled , often in a diffusive manner .",
    "however , much less is known about the evolution of chaotic perturbations in _ inhomogeneous _ extended systems , where the many coupled elements are either different or the coupling itself is a quenched random field that varies along the system .",
    "such conditions naturally arise in some important applications , _",
    "e.  g. _  in regional weather forecasting , where inhomogeneity is present in the form of explicit surface - topography dependent terms  @xcite in the dynamic equations .",
    "inhomogeneous secs can indeed demonstrate rather unusual properties , like for instance taming of spatiotemporal chaos induced by disorder  @xcite , disorder - enhanced synchronization  @xcite , and avoided crossing and level repulsion similar to that ocurring for energy eigenvalues in disordered quantum systems  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the dynamics of perturbations in disordered secs , which has been little investigated in the literature . we analyze here a rather simple but enlightening model consisting of a lattice of coupled chaotic elements whose parameters are randomly distributed or the coupling among them is a quenched random variable .",
    "we show that long - range temporal correlations , induced by the quenched disorder , can cause perturbations to strongly localize .",
    "the strong localization observed here is essentially different from the dynamical localization that has been previously reported for homogeneous secs  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the positions of the localization centers keep fluctuating in space , while in the presence of quenched disorder we find that the positions of the localization centers are fixed for a given disorder realization .",
    "we analyze typical perturbations , @xmath0 , by making use of the hopf - cole transform , @xmath3 , and mapping to the equivalent surface growth problem .",
    "strong localization leads to the formation of faceted structures in the corresponding surface picture .",
    "these lyapunov surfaces also exhibit a coarsening behavior and anomalous kinetic roughening , akin to some nonequilibrium growing surfaces .",
    "the connection of the problem of the propagation of errors in disordered secs with the problem of diffusion in random potentials is also discussed .",
    "we propose a phenomenological stochastic field theory pointing toward a generalization of our results for a broad class of disordered extended systems exhibiting space - time chaos .",
    "we focus our numerical study on coupled - map lattices with quenched disorder .",
    "we consider @xmath4 coupled chaotic maps @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , following the evolution equation @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are the disordered nearest - neighbor coupling constants , @xmath9 is the on - site contribution , and @xmath10 is the local nonlinear map at site @xmath11 . here",
    "we choose @xmath12 , which is a periodic continuation of the tent - map .",
    "this map shows chaotic behavior for @xmath13 , with a lyapunov exponent that grows logarithmically with @xmath14 .",
    "this choice allows one to study extended coupled systems with a spatial distribution of lyapunov exponents by allowing @xmath14 to take randomly distributed values along the lattice .",
    "almost any initial random perturbation @xmath15 will grow in magnitude and develop space - time correlations while propagating along the system , quickly aligning with the most unstable direction in tangent space , the so - called main lv : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is just the derivative of the local map @xmath18 with respect to its argument @xmath19 .",
    "numerical integration of the tangent space equations ( [ evoerrors ] ) looks apparently rather simple , however , a caveat is in order .",
    "we found that the introduction of quenched disorder leads to the appearance of very large differences among error field @xmath20 values at certain sites of the system .",
    "the reason for this is the quenched nature of the disorder so that , if a large value of the random variable is assigned to a given site , it will continue giving high contributions for all times .",
    "in fact , these differences can become so large during the simulation that , if we were to naively integrate ( [ evoerrors ] ) and just multiply by some global factor to avoid numerical overflow , the perturbation field at those sites where the perturbation values are small would soon be considered as zero by the computer due to accuracy limitations .",
    "it is rather simple to overcome this technical problem by avoiding calculating the @xmath21 directly , but rather computing the quotients @xmath22 and @xmath23 instead .",
    "we therefore rewrite ( [ evoerrors ] ) as @xmath24 now we can numerically integrate this pair of equations instead of eq .",
    "( [ evoerrors ] ) .",
    "this useful numerical trick resolves the problem of possible overflows during the simulations .",
    "we have studied three different scenarios for a disordered couple - map lattice system . in the first scenario ( model a ) we consider the case in which the couplings are identical along the system , but coupled elements are inhomogeneous . in the simplest",
    "setting we can model this situation by drawing the local map constant @xmath14 from a uniform distribution , so we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 . note that we chose a homogeneous democratic coupling ( @xmath27 ) all along the system .",
    "in this situation individual elements are more chaotic or less chaotic depending on the corresponding value of @xmath14 .",
    "larger values of @xmath14 lead to a locally faster growth of the perturbation at site @xmath11 . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is only true for uncoupled maps .",
    "things are a much more involved here since the maps are coupled .",
    "thus , the behavior of the perturbation at one site does not only depend on the map at that specific site , but also on the dynamics of its neighborhood .",
    "a different source of disorder we have explored is the existence of a quenched random coupling , while the individual maps are all identical .",
    "this corresponds to systems with a disordered diffusion coefficient . from the classical theory of diffusion in disordered media",
    "we know that two different symmetries are of interest  @xcite .",
    "these two models are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and described in detail below .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    on the one hand , we have the _ random barrier _ ( rb ) model  @xcite .",
    "physically this corresponds to the existence of a random potential barrier between every two neighboring sites so that the diffusion coefficient from site @xmath11 to site @xmath28 is equal to that from site @xmath28 to site @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the disorder is associated with the bonds connecting neighboring sites on the lattice .",
    "we call this configuration model b : @xmath29 where the disorder is drawn from a uniform distribution , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 being an arbitrary parameter that we take as @xmath32 unless otherwise stated",
    ".    on the other hand , some disordered systems are better described by the so - called _ random trap _ ( rt ) model  @xcite . in this case",
    "a static disordered diffusion coefficient is assigned to each lattice site @xmath11 instead to bonds .",
    "this corresponds to our model c , which is defined by @xmath33 where the disorder is uniformly distributed , @xmath30 , and again @xmath31 can be any number in the interval @xmath34 , here we use @xmath35 .",
    "typical lyapunov spectra corresponding to the three disordered models introduced here are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for a system of size @xmath36 and averages over 10 different disorder realizations .",
    "one can see that , depending on the model , one has 30 - 80  % of the spectra in the region @xmath37 .",
    "note that lyapunov spectra are self - averaging , therefore spectra for a single realization differ from the average in small fluctuations , which for large enough systems are negligible .",
    "some remarks are now in order .",
    "first , let us stress that these two disordered diffusion configurations , namely rb and rt , were not chosen arbitrarily , but are in fact all existing physically meaningful ways to introduce disorder in the diffusive couplings  @xcite .",
    "second , it is important to remark that in this paper we focus on systems in the presence of _ weak _ disorder , where the probability density of having zero disorder at any given site , @xmath38 , is bounded .",
    "we do leave out of our study the case of _ strong _ disorder , @xmath39 , where a fraction of the system sites can effectively act as sinks , which is known to have a great impact on the asymptotic transport properties  @xcite and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "coupled tent maps after average over ten different disorder realizations.[fig2],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in principle , classical results on the problem of diffusion in random media  @xcite may also be invoked to argue that the details of the disorder distribution should be irrelevant in the sense that weak disorder gives rise to the same asymptotic dynamical behavior independently of the detailed form of the disorder distribution .",
    "the same conclusion applies in the case of strong disorder , where the asymptotic dynamics is fully determined by the form of the divergence at the origin , _ i.e. _  the value of the exponent @xmath40 . in the following we focus on the case of weak disorder and a uniform distribution @xmath41 with the parameter @xmath35",
    "is used to exemplify our results . however , in the presence of random multiplicative terms the critical behavior might be affected by the detailed form of the disorder distribution  @xcite .",
    "as occurs in the case of homogeneous systems , the dynamics of the main lv can be conveniently described in terms of the equivalent surface picture  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the logarithm of the perturbation field turns out to be scale - invariant , so that correlations have the form of power - law functions and critical exponents can then be used to characterize the space - time structure of perturbations . therefore , in this paper we are interested in the scaling properties of the rough surface defined by the hopf - cole transform of the perturbation @xmath42 .",
    "space - time scaling properties of chaotic perturbations in inhomogeneous systems turn out to be very different from those in homogeneous systems , even in the case of weak disorder studied here . as can be immediately seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , a first observation is the patterned structure of the lv surface , which is visible to the naked eye and contrasts with the kpz - type morphologies observed in homogeneous systems  @xcite .",
    "this already indicates that significant differences are to be expected in the scaling properties of inhomogeneous systems .",
    "even weak disorder induces self - organization in a triangular structure , which reflects the strong spatial localization of the perturbation in the form of a exponential profile around some strong pinning centers .",
    "note that a facet , @xmath43 corresponds to an exponential profile of the perturbation , @xmath44 $ ] , around the pinning center @xmath45 .    .",
    "one can observe the emergence of facets that grow in time until , in the long time limit , the whole interface is spanned by one single facet .",
    "tiny fluctuations can be observed at small scales .",
    "the data correspond to model c in a lattice of @xmath46 maps.[fig3],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot a typical evolution of the main lv according to eq .",
    "( [ evoerrors ] ) in a system of size @xmath46 for a given disorder realization in the case of model c. we observe that at short times , the surface @xmath2 is composed of triangular facets of varying sizes which grow in time until , in the long time limit , the whole interface is formed by just one single facet .",
    "therefore , as time evolves the size of the triangles increases and number of triangles diminishes .",
    "this surface dynamics corresponds to non - equilibrium coarsening. similar triangular morphologies are obtained for the three models a , b and c introduced above .",
    "close inspection and analysis of critical exponents shows that the three models actually belong to different universality classes .    in order to characterize the growth of the faceted pattern we have measured the lateral mound size @xmath47 , which gives the coarsening length or typical length scale of the instability",
    "this is usually done by calculating the slope - slope correlation function @xmath48 and measuring the distance , @xmath47 , at which this correlation crosses zero .",

    "the scaling analysis of the surface fluctuations presented in the preceding sections has shown that the lv surface self - organizes in a characteristic triangular pattern for all the three models of disorder . a closer inspection , in particular the computation of the structure factor ,",
    "has also revealed the existence of a cutoff at small scales such that length scales below that point obey a different dynamics .",
    "this suggests the existence of another dynamical process taking place at small scales which is different from the mechanism responsible for the large scale faceted structure .",

    "hence , for a finite size system the asymptotic scaling behavior may not be observable if the thermal noise amplitude is too large .",
    "this is of some importance for the situations we are interested in because , when considering the evolution of perturbations in secs , there will always be some temporally fluctuating noise as explained above .",
    "thus , even if quenched disorder is present in the studied system , it may be very weak in comparison with the temporally fluctuating one . in that case",
    "the behavior described here would only be observable in very large systems .",
    "moreover , it should be noticed that , although the roughness exponents @xmath56 , @xmath64 and @xmath78 seem to be the same within error bars for the three models of disorder studied in this paper , the dynamic exponent @xmath63 does take different values .",

    "classical diffusion in random media involves the study of equations like  ( [ eq_model_b ] ) and ( [ eq_model_c ] ) , but where the multiplicative term @xmath175 is absent .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that , in the long time limit , dynamics of rb and rt models is identical , even for strong disorder . despite the different symmetries involved , the large scale physics is the same .",
    "however , our numerical results indicate that model b ( rb symmetry ) and model c ( rt symmetry ) in secs seemingly belong to different universality classes .",
    "we claim that the multiplicative noise , which is generically coupled to the quenched disorder in the systems we have studied , breaks the duality between rb and rt type of disorder in this case , leading to distinct dynamical exponents for the two different diffusion configurations .",

    "we find a strong localization behavior characterized by an exponential spatial profile around some localization centers . in the long time",
    "limit the perturbation concentrates around one single final attracting center .",
    "we have also studied the second , third , and so on backward lvs corresponding to most rapidly expanding directions in tangent space and found a correspondence between the localization centers and the positions in space corresponding to increasing minima of the diffusion in the particular disorder realization .",
    "note that the strong localization behavior described here is essentially different from the dynamic localization observed in the case of homogeneous secs . in the latter , perturbations",
    "do also localize on just a few sites , but the position of these sites keeps fluctuating in time .",
    "however , in the presence of quenched disorder the sites where perturbations localize are fixed by the corresponding realization of the disorder .    moreover , by a standard mapping ( hopf - cole transform ) of the perturbation into a growing surface we found that the lv associated surfaces self - organize in a faceted structure , at variance with what occurs in homogeneous ( non disordered ) systems where one generically obtains a surface in the universality class of kpz .",
    "interestingly , this faceted surface was found to exhibit coarsening and anomalous kinetic roughening in agreement with previous theoretical predictions  @xcite for this type of scale - invariant structures .",
    "the evolution of infinitesimal perturbations in spatially extended chaotic systems with quenched disorder may be described at a coarse - grained level as a diffusion process in a random potential .",
    "note , however , that the value of the dynamical exponent @xmath63 depends on how disorder is introduced .",
    "the reason for this is possibly the influence of the disorder distribution on the temporal dependence of the coarsening , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of diffusion ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion relevant to the present work )    we think that strong localization and anomalous scaling should play a role , _ e.  g. _  in realistic weather models , where quenched disorder is included in the form of inhomogeneous boundary conditions representing certain geographical and topographical conditions .",
