    "_ @xmath0cdm ( euclidean geometry , cosmological constant @xmath0 and cold dark matter ) cosmology can be completed only if the values of its key parameters are determined as precisely and accurately as possible . among the various probes that have so far been developed for the accurate measurements of the key cosmological parameters , the best",
    "one is undoubtedly the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature spectrum since the cmb sky provides us the least evolved version of our universe whose physics we believe are well understood . although using the cmb spectrum as a cosmological probe suffers from the parameter degeneracy , this downside has been overcome by combining the cmb measurements with the results from the other complimentary probes such as the local cluster counts , the weak gravitational lensing , the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) features and etc .    the recently reported tensions between the parameter values determined from the local universe and from the cmb sky scanned by the planck satellite @xcite gave a great anxiety to the community , since the last ( and perhaps the most crucial ) puzzle to the standard flat @xmath0cdm picture is the consistency between the local and the distant scales ( or the late and the early universe ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , the planck constraint on the hubble constant , @xmath1 , is lower than the locally determined value , @xmath2 , by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of the cepheid variable stars @xcite .",
    "the planck constraints on the density parameter , @xmath3 , and the amplitude of the linear power spectrum , @xmath4 , are also in significant tension with the local measurements , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , from the low-@xmath7 cluster counts @xcite . to make matters worse , very recently , the planck team traced the abundance evolution of the @xmath8 massive clusters detected via the sunyaev- zeldovich ( sz ) effect and determined the best constraints as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are even more serious @xmath11 deviations from the planck best - fit ranges @xcite .",
    "these best - fit values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 determined from the late universe indicate that the observed number densities of the galaxy clusters in the local universe are much lower than predicted in the planck cosmology .",
    "these tensions have caught immediate attentions , provoking a burst of research to find solutions as well as their origins .",
    "although some unknown systematics could have biased the local measurements of the cosmological parameters , the recent hot trend is to suspect the model - dependent values of the planck experiments and to suggest possible solutions based on such non - standard models as a @xmath0cdm with massive neutrinos @xcite , a @xmath0cdm with scale dependent non - gaussian initial conditions @xcite , a coupled dark energy ( cde ) model @xcite , a @xmath0cdm with an `` inhomogeneous geometry '' @xcite and so on . while the solutions to the tensions based on the above alternative models are definitely worth pursuing , it has to be noted that their capacity of alleviating the tensions have been achieved only at the cost of increasing the numbers of the cosmological parameters .    in the current work ,",
    "we explore a possibility to explain away the tensions within the standard flat @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "our exploration will start from a core assumption that the local universe has formed in a crest of the primordial gravitational potential field and then will proceed in the direction of investigating if the observed lower amplitudes of the cluster mass functions are consistent with the planck cosmology under this assumption .",
    "in the standard theory of structure formation , the primordial gravitational potential field , @xmath14 , is regarded as a gaussian random field , being related to the linear density contrast field @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that since the primordial potential field is much smoother than the linear density field , it is possible to determine a characteristic comoving scale , @xmath17 , of the `` raw '' unsmoothed primordial potential fluctuations as @xmath18 where the rms fluctuations of @xmath14 and @xmath19 can be written in terms of the linear density power spectrum , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the wave number corresponding the comoving cosmic horizon introduced to prevent a divergence of @xmath23 in practical calculation .",
    "note that there is no filtering by any kernel in equation ( [ eqn : sigp ] ) , as stated in @xcite .",
    "since the probability density of @xmath14 is gaussian distributed , finding a region with @xmath24 ( crest ) in the primordial potential field is as equally probable as that with @xmath25 ( trough ) , i.e. , @xmath26 .    here",
    ", we set up a hypothesis that the present local universe have formed in a primordial potential crest with @xmath24 rather than in a trough with @xmath25 in the early universe .",
    "this hypothesis naturally leads to an expectation that the cluster number densities measured in the local universe would be lower than the global counterparts for a given background cosmology .",
    "the intriguing question is whether or not this hypothesis can explain away the tension between the local and the planck measurements of the key cosmological parameters , especially , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , on which the cluster number densities are most strongly dependent .",
    "it is of importance to understand that the characteristic comoving scale @xmath17 of the primordial potential field represents its scale of coherence . according to @xcite , even though the formation of massive clusters are strongly biased toward the primordial potential troughs with @xmath25 ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not totally impossible for the massive clusters to form in a primordial potential crest .",
    "now , imagine a halo formed in a primordial potential crest with @xmath27 .",
    "since the peculiar velocity of this halo is always in the direction from a crest to a trough of the primordial potential field , it is expected that the halo would be displaced during the evolution by gravitational effect from the formation site .",
    "if its maximum displacement distance from the formation site is smaller than @xmath17 , then this halo can be regarded as having effectively stayed in the primordial potential crest during the whole evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "if its maximum displacement distance exceeds @xmath17 , then the halo is regarded as having been displaced from the crest region in the subsequent evolution . as for the galaxy clusters , their maximum displacement distances are usually much smaller than ( see eq.[11 ] in lee & shandarin 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , if formed in a primordial potential crest , the galaxy clusters are expected to have stayed in the crest during the whole evolution . unlike the smoothing scale ,",
    "the characteristic scale @xmath17 is not an extrinsic scale but an intrinsic one determined only by the background cosmology . for the planck cosmology with @xmath28 @xcite",
    ", it is found to be @xmath29mpc .",
    "we adopt the analytic prescription laid out in the work of @xcite which basically incorporated the effect of primordial potential on the number densities of the dark halos into the classical mass function formalism of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , ps ) .",
    "although the ps mass function has been well known to be inaccurate when tested against the numerical results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is the only `` purely '' analytic mass function theory into which it is rather straightforward to incorporate the condition of @xmath24 without resorting to any empirical adjustment from n - body simulations . since our goal here is not to model as accurately as possible the number densities of cluster halos in a primordial potential crest but to see how much the condition of @xmath24 decreases the cluster number densities relative to the unconditional one , we believe that a modified version of the ps formalism should suffice to achieve this goal .",
    "the ps formalism relates the differential mass function , @xmath30 , of dark halos to the fraction of the volumes , @xmath31 , occupied by those regions whose linear density contrasts , @xmath15 , exceed a unique threshold value @xmath32 @xcite , when the linear density field is smoothed on a given mass scale @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a gaussian probability density of @xmath15 with the standard deviation @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the mean mass density of the universe and the factor of @xmath38 before represents the normalization factor of the mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the standard deviation , @xmath36 , depends on the mass scale @xmath33 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fourier transform of a kernel by which the linear density contrast field is smoothed on the mass scale of @xmath33 .    incorporating the condition of @xmath24 into the ps formalism",
    "amounts to modifying the volume fraction @xmath41 in equation ( [ eqn : f ] ) into @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the square root of the cross correlation between the _ unsmoothed _ primordial potential field , @xmath14 , and the smoothed density field on the mass scale @xmath33 , @xmath15 . since the fourier transform of the unsmoothed primordial potential field @xmath45",
    "is related to the fourier transform of the smoothed linear density field @xmath46 as @xmath47 , the cross - correlation @xmath48 can be evaluated as @xmath49     for the planck cosmology ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the anti - biased and the biased cases that the local universe corresponds to a crest and a trough of the primordial potential field , respectively .",

    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to the cases that the cluster halos formed in a primordial potential crest and trough , respectively .",
    "the latter can be straightforwardly evaluated by repeating the same steps described in equations ( [ eqn : f_con])-([eqn : dmudm ] ) but with changing the crest condition of @xmath24 into the trough condition of @xmath25 as in @xcite .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : mf ] corresponds to the case of no condition , i.e , the original _ unconditional _ ps mass function of the cluster halos .",
    "the bottom panel shows the ratio of the two conditional mass functions to the unconditional one as solid and dashed lines , respectively , while the horizontal dotted line corresponds to unity . for this plot ,",
    "the key cosmological parameters are set at the planck values of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , the number densities of the cluster halos formed in a primordial potential crest ( trough ) are indeed lower ( higher ) than the unconditional counterpart .",
    "since what has been always assumed in the theoretical modeling of the cluster mass function is that there is no difference between the local and the global average number densities of the clusters , our result implies that the comparison between the observed number densities of the local clusters and the analytic model of the unconditional mass function would yield different best - fit values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the planck constraints , even when the background is truly the planck universe .",
    "@xcite , while the dashed line corresponds to the low-@xmath7 cluster cosmology with @xmath70 @xcite .",

    "the conditional number counts of the massive clusters formed in a primordial potential crest ( @xmath24 ) for the planck cosmology is plotted as solid line .",
    ", width=360 ]    we evaluate the unconditional mass functions of the cluster halos by equations ( [ eqn : dndm_ps])-([eqn : f ] ) for two different cosmologies and plot them in figure [ fig : mf_lowz ] as dotted and dashed lines , respectively : the dotted line corresponds to the case of the planck cosmology with @xmath73 , while the dashed line corresponds to the case of the low-@xmath7 cluster cosmology with @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the two cases obviously reveals that the unconditional cluster mass function for the low-@xmath7 cluster cosmology has a significantly lower amplitude than that for the planck cosmology especially in the high - mass section .",
    "evaluating the conditional mass function of the cluster halos formed in a primordial potential crest by equations ( [ eqn : f_con])-([eqn : dmudm ] ) for the planck cosmology , we show it as solid line in figure [ fig : mf_lowz ] . surprisingly , the solid line is in an excellent agreement with the dashed line .",
    "a crucial implication of this result is that the observed lower number densities of the local clusters are in fact fully consistent with the planck constraints as far as the condition of @xmath24 for the local universe is properly taken into account when the theoretical prediction for the cluster mass function is made .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that our analytic prescription of evaluating the conditional mass function of galaxy clusters in the local universe suffers from one ambiguity .",
    "since we deal with the _ scale - free _ unsmoothed primordial potential field , the scale of its crest region in which our local universe is assumed to reside is unknown and thus has to be determined empirically . given that the effective redshift of the clusters considered by @xcite is approximately @xmath75 , the scale of the local universe should extend at least up to the same redshift , @xmath76 , which amounts to @xmath77mpc for the planck cosmology . in other words , to reconcile the planck cosmology with the mass function of the low-@xmath7 clusters in the sample of @xcite , it has to be assumed that the local universe corresponds to a primordial potential crest of comoving size as large as @xmath77mpc .",
    "let us examine if incorporating the condition of @xmath24 can also resolve the other tension between the constraints of @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the planck sz catalogs and the planck cosmology .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , the abundance evolution of the sz clusters measured by @xcite has yielded the best - fit constraints of @xmath78 provided that the dimensionless hubble parameter is given as @xmath79 ( say , the sz cluster cosmology ) . here",
    ", the abundance evolution of the galaxy clusters , @xmath80 , is proportional to the number counts , @xmath81 , of the cluster halos as a function of redshift defined as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the mass threshold set at @xmath84 for our analysis .",
    "we evaluate the _ unconditional _ number counts of the galaxy clusters as a function of redshift , @xmath81 , by integrating equation ( [ eqn : dndm_ps ] ) over mass for the sz cluster cosmology and show it as dashed line in figure [ fig : mf_sz ] . comparing the dashed line with the dotted line in figure [ fig : mf_sz ] which is nothing but the unconditional number counts , @xmath81 , for the planck cosmology , one can see that the difference in the prediction for @xmath81 between the two cosmologies is quite large .",
    "now , evaluating the conditional number counts , @xmath85 , by integrating equation ( [ eqn : dndm_con ] ) over @xmath33 for the planck cosmology , we show it as solid line in figure [ fig : mf_sz ] .",
    "it is exciting to see that the solid line exhibits a wonderful match ( especially in amplitude ) to the dashed line .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that although the redshifts of the galaxy clusters in the planck sz catalog are distributed in a wide range of @xmath86 , the constraints from the planck sz clusters on the values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 were decisively determined in the the low-@xmath7 section ( @xmath87 ) . from figure 7 in @xcite which plots the number counts of the sz clusters as a function of redshift , one can see that the data points in the high-@xmath7 section ( @xmath88 ) suffer from large uncertainties and that the amplitude of @xmath80 is determined almost decisively by those data points with small errors in the low-@xmath7 section ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "thus , the anti - biasing effect of the primordial potential fluctuation can also reconcile the redshift distribution of the local sz clusters with the planck cosmology .",
    "to solve the problem that the constraints on @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the observed cluster mass functions in the local universe @xcite and from the redshift evolution of the sz cluster counts @xcite are both in tension with the constraints from the planck experiments @xcite , we have put forward a new hypothesis that the local universe formed in a crest of the primordial gravitational potential and has stayed in the potential crest after the formation . under this hypothesis ,",
    "we have evaluated analytically the number densities of the cluster halos formed in a primordial potential crest at present epoch with the help of the analytic prescriptions suggested by @xcite who had modified the original ps mass function theory to incorporate the effect of primordial potential .",
    "when the condition of being in a primordial potential crest is imposed , the resulting _ conditional _ mass function of cluster halos has been found to exhibit significantly lower amplitude than the unconditional one .",
    "we have finally explained away the tension between the planck and the local measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath13 by revealing the following two results : ( i ) the conditional mass function of cluster halos for the case of the planck cosmology with @xmath90 and @xmath91 agree almost perfectly with the unconditional mass function for the low-@xmath7 cluster cosmology with @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; ( ii ) the redshift evolution of the conditional cluster counts for the case of the planck cosmology matches that of the unconditional ones for the case of the cosmology from the planck sz clusters with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "it should be worth discussing the apparent similarity and the essential difference between our analytic prescription of evaluating the cluster mass function and the one proposed by @xcite in the context of the lemairte - tolman - bondi cosmology @xcite .",
    "although both of the models have evaluated the halo mass function with an assumption that the local universe corresponds to a low - density region , the latter is based on the radical hypothesis that there is no dark energy in the universe ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) in a direct contrast to the former which is well accommodated by the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology .    here",
    "we have followed the purely theoretical approach based on the analytic ps formalism of the halo mass function . however , it would be definitely desirable to make a direct comparison with the observed cluster counts , which requires to construct a more improved formalism for the conditional mass function , given the inaccuracy of the ps formalism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as for the unconditional mass function of cluster halos , there have been plenty of literatures which developed more improved analytic formalism by making more complicated and realistic assumptions about the halo formation process such as ellipsoidal collapse , diffusive collapse threshold , and non- markovian random walks and etc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the formalism for the conditional mass function has to be improved and refined similarly before testing directly our hypothesis against observations .",
    "although we have focused mainly on the parameters of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the current work , it will be intriguing to investigate if our hypothesis can also lead to a reconciliation between the planck and the local measurements of the hubble constant @xmath96 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in fact , it can be logically expected that if the local universe corresponds to a primordial potential crest , then the density contrast averaged over the local universe would be lower than the global average , which would be reflected by a higher value of @xmath96 when measured locally than its global value determined from the cmb analysis . to quantitatively investigate this effect of primordial potential on the hubble constant ,",
    "however , it will be first required to study rigorously the evolution of the linear overdense region embedded in a primordial potential crest .",
    "the other interesting issue that our hypothesis might be useful to address is the lower growth rate , @xmath97 , inferred from the recently available deep galaxy surveys than predicted by the planck cosmology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although the change of the linear growth factor , @xmath98 , by the primordial anti - biasing has not been accounted for in our analysis under the assumption that it would be small @xcite , the growth rate in a primordial potential crest that has a locally negative curvature must be lower than the average value .",
    "we believe that incorporating the condition of @xmath24 into the calculation of the linear growth rate might also provide a clue to resolving the apparent inconsistency found in @xcite .",
    "our future work is in the direction of conducting these works .",
