    "nonlinear elastic wave propagation is a subject of considerable interest for many natural and industrial applications such as seismology @xcite , soft tissue acoustics @xcite , or the dynamics of elastomers @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the theoretical issues associated with wave phenomena forms the basis of our understanding of important non - destructive and non - invasive techniques of investigation such as for instance , the technique of transient elastography for the analysis of soft solids @xcite .",
    "the mathematics of wave phenomena is still an active subject of research where many outstanding problems are waiting for a definitive systematic treatment .",
    "many papers are devoted to the study of nonlinear elastic wave propagation and a recent summary on the status of contemporary research on the subject can be found in the authoritative review by norris @xcite , while an account of the mathematics of hyperbolic conservation laws can be found in a book by dafermos @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that in most studies of nonlinear acoustics , the investigation is usually restricted to _ weakly nonlinear _ waves .",
    "indeed , for materials such as metals , rocks , or ceramics , the ratio of the dynamic displacement to the wavelength is a small parameter and so , the theories of third - order elasticity or of fourth - order elasticity seem to be sufficient to account for the nonlinear effects observed in experimental tests .",
    "the situation is however completely different when we consider elastomeric materials such as those used for vibration isolators or automobile tires , and when we consider biological materials such as arterial walls or glands , under physiological or pathological conditions .",
    "the deformation rates occurring in these materials are so large that their behavior will differ significantly not only from the behavior predicted by the linear theory of elasticity , but also from the behavior predicted by the weakly nonlinear theories",
    ". it should therefore be important to be able to derive and to investigate the general equations governing the propagation of finite amplitude longitudinal and transverse waves in the context of full nonlinear elasticity , which recovers the weakly nonlinear case as a special case .",
    "moreover , recent researches in the constitutive behavior of rubber - like material indicate that the stiffening effect , a peculiar but real phenomenon occurring at very large strains , can not be described accurately when the full polynomial strain energy function is approximated ; also , high order polynomial theories may give rise to numerical difficulties in the fitting of the material parameters with the experimental data and to artificial instability phenomena ( see pucci and saccomandi @xcite and ogden et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these considerations have led to the present paper which is devoted to the study of the interaction of a longitudinal wave with transverse waves in _ general isotropic _ and _ unconstrained hyperelastic _ materials and this also when _ dissipation _ is taken into account .",
    "the aim of our research is first , to derive the corresponding general equations of motion , valid for any possible form of the strain energy function ; second , to investigate the possibility of obtaining some general and exact solutions to these equations by reducing the specific field equations to a set of ordinary differential equations ; and third , to provide , using these reductions , some exact closed - form solutions for special classes of materials .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "previous studies taking systematically into account the full nonlinear equations of motion have generally been restricted to the formal theory of singular surfaces and of acceleration waves .",
    "these studies stem from the fundamental researches initiated by hadamard @xcite in 1903 and were advanced mainly by ericksen , by thomas , and by truesdell in the 1950s and 1960s ( see for example truesdell @xcite and the review by chen @xcite ) .",
    "they show that the conjunction of the nonlinearity in the material response and of the hyperbolic nature of the governing equations ( in the purely elastic case ) leads inevitably to shock formation .",
    "the results obtained are general and exact but they are formal results : in effect , no solution is found explicitly but rather , conditions are given that have to be fulfilled by solutions , if they exist .",
    "in contrast , the present article focuses on the explicit determination of solutions .",
    "our investigation is directly related to the celebrated finite amplitude elastic motions discovered by carroll @xcite .",
    "his exact solutions are versatile in their fields of application because they are valid not only for nonlinearly elastic solids , but also for general viscoelastic solids @xcite , reiner - rivlin fluids @xcite , stokesian fluids @xcite , rivlin - ericksen fluids @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite , dielectrics @xcite , magnetic materials @xcite , etc .",
    "they also come in a great variety of forms , as circularly - polarized harmonic progressive waves , as motions with sinusoidal time dependence , as motions with sinusoidal space dependence , etc .",
    "recently the present authors @xcite extended carroll s solutions to the case of an incompressible hyperelastic body in rotation , by considering a new synthetic and very effective method based on complex variables . in doing so",
    ", they discovered a striking analogy between the equations of motion obtained for a motion general enough to include all of the above motions , and the equations obtained for the motion of a nonlinear string , as considered by rosenau and rubin @xcite . the method used by rosenau and rubin shows in a simple and direct way that all ( and more ) of the different results obtained by carroll are a direct consequence of material isotropy and of the galilean invariance of the field equations .",
    "this is indeed an explanation for their ubiquity and versatility .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section",
    "ii we lay out the general field equations of nonlinear elasticity . because dissipation can not be neglected for most problems in the dynamics of elastomeric materials and of soft tissues , we add a simple inelastic tensor of differential type to the hyperelastic cauchy stress tensor .",
    "this additional term is similar to the classical stress tensor describing a stokesian fluid ; it is the dissipative term introduced by landau and lifshitz in their monograph on elasticity theory @xcite and it is commonly used in nonlinear acoustics ( see norris @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that this term is different from the one used in continuum mechanics as a first approximation of dissipative effects or as a regularization of the hyperbolic equations of nonlinear elastodynamics for example in numerical computations @xcite .",
    "then we specialize the equations of motion to the case of one longitudinal wave and two transverse waves . in section iii",
    "we seek solutions in time / space separable form and derive nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations for generalized oscillatory shearing motions and for generalized sinusoidal standing waves . in section iv",
    ", different classes of materials are considered ( hadamard , blatz - ko , power - law , fourth - order elasticity ) and some exact solutions are provided . concluding remarks are made in section v , which recaps the main results . in particular , it is emphasized there that a weak nonlinear elasticity theory ( up to the fourth order ) can not account for some wrinkling phenomenon found in the fully nonlinear theory ( power - law strain energy ) .",
    "consider a hyperelastic body with strain energy density @xmath0 .",
    "let the initial and current coordinates of a point of the body , referred to the same fixed rectangular cartesian system of axes , be denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "hence a motion of the body is defined by @xmath3 the response of a homogeneous compressible isotropic elastic solid to deformations from an undistorted reference configuration is described by the constitutive relation @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ( elastic ) cauchy stress tensor , @xmath6 is the unit tensor , @xmath7 is the left cauchy - green strain tensor defined by @xmath8 @xmath9 being the deformation gradient tensor , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the first three invariants of @xmath7 , @xmath13,\\quad i_{3}:=\\det \\mathbf{b}.   \\label{invariants}\\ ] ]    to describe the simultaneous effects of thermal and viscoelastic dissipation , we introduce the following viscous - like stress tensor @xcite , @xmath14+(\\zeta + \\chi ) ( \\text{tr } \\dot{\\mathbf{e}})% \\mathbf{1 } ,   \\label{d}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the green - lagrange strain tensor , @xmath16 and the dot indicates the time derivative . in , the constant @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the shear viscosity coefficient , the constant @xmath19 ( @xmath18 ) is the bulk viscosity coefficient , and the constant @xmath20 ( @xmath18 ) is the coefficient related to the thermal properties of the solid ( that is , ambient temperature , thermal expansion coefficient , and specific heat ) .",

    "holmes @xcite showed that equation is locally and globally stable .",
    "it follows that as @xmath292 , our standing waves must approach one of the four wrinkled configurations @xmath293 for almost any initial conditions . as any one of the four final configurations is equivalent to another , we conclude that the material is destabilized by the waves ( only some special choices of the initial conditions will lead to the unstressed deformation corresponding to the saddle point ( 0,0 ) ; these special initial conditions are found by computing the corresponding stable manifold in the phase plane , and we refer to holmes @xcite for the details . )    the situation described here can be extended to all positive integers @xmath260 , because the leading of nonlinearity of the potential @xmath294 in is @xmath295 so that the leading order of nonlinearity in the resulting differential equation is always to an odd integer power .",
    "we also point out that for a given @xmath259 , an increasing @xmath260 requires a decreasing @xmath296 for the appearance of the fixed points that is , a greater compressive stretch in the @xmath37-direction .",
    "this is in agreement with the `` physical '' expectation that the stiffer a material is , the harder it is to destabilize it .    for non - integer powers @xmath260 ,",
    "the situation is more complex because destabilizing configurations may or may not appear in the case of strain - hardening materials ( @xmath262 ) _ and _ in the case of strain - softening materials ( @xmath263 ) .",
    "obviously the dynamical systems uncovered here are susceptible to a more complete and more careful analysis than the one provided , which may reveal even richer behaviors than those already described , such as for example the appearance of parametric resonance ; these aspects are however beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "finally , we note that the instability evoked in this subsection is somewhat reminiscent of the buckling of an elasticita under a compressive load , but we point out several differences .",
    "the buckling of an elastica is a phenomenon related to geometrical non - linearities , whereas our instability is due to constitutive non - linearities ; in an elastica , more than one inflexion may occur whereas here , we could multiply instabilities only by considering a multiple well strain energy function ( and such a strain energy is not usual for the modeling of soft tissues and elastomers ) ; for an elastica , the stability of the various fixed points must be examined thoroughly , whereas here , the stability of such points comes out directly from our dynamical approach .      in the linearized theory of `` small - but - finite '' amplitude waves ,",
    "the strain energy function must be expanded up to the fourth order in the strain , in order to reveal nonlinear shear waves @xcite . in that framework ,",
    "murnaghan s expansion @xcite is often used ( see for instance porubov @xcite ) : @xmath297 where @xmath164 , @xmath165 are the lam moduli , @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath260 are the third - order moduli , and @xmath300 , @xmath301 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 are the fourth - order moduli ( other notations exist : see norris @xcite for the connections ) . in this expansion",

    "first of all , we recall that the equations corresponding to ( [ equazio ] ) for third - order elasticity ( without dissipation ) were first derived by goldberg @xcite in 1960",
    ".    then we note that recently there has been a renewed interested in fourth - order elasticity following experiments on the nonlinear acoustic properties of soft tissue - like solids @xcite .",
    "hence hamilton et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the following reduced version of the expansion , suitable when the relative portion of energy stored in compression is negligible , as is expected for shear deformations and motions of soft tissues , @xmath310 in this case , the functions @xmath131 and @xmath167 defined in simplify to @xmath311 and we check at once that the longitudinal equation of motion @xmath141 becomes a trivial identity in the purely elastic case ( @xmath312 ) , because here @xmath313 .    finally , we also notice that the theories of third- and fourth - order elasticity have been used to study bulk solitons propagation in elastic materials . for instance ,",
    "hao and marris @xcite discuss the issue of acoustic solitons from both experimental and theoretical points of view ; they consider the possibility to produce kdv solitons by adding a fourth - order spatial derivative to the longitudinal wave equation and by performing some _ ad hoc _ approximations .",
    "the general expressions , , and yield quite complicated equations of motion .",
    "if for example we restrict our attention to the standing waves , we find that the polynomial nonlinearity of the resulting ordinary differential equation is of the fifth order for third - order elasticity , and of seventh order for fourth - order elasticity . if we further restrict our attention to the reduced expansion we find that equation reduces to a damped duffing equation , @xmath314 this equation is characterized by a positive linear stiffness and therefore the peculiar behavior found in the previous sub - section for some power - law materials is _",
    "ruled out_. for completeness , we point out that holmes and rand @xcite computed an approximate solution of equation , using the method of averaging .",
    "we studied the propagation of finite amplitude waves in a general nonlinear elastic material , with dissipation taken into account by means of a simple mechanism of differential type .",
    "we showed that the general equations of motion admit some beautiful and most interesting reductions to ordinary differential equations , using a direct method based on complex functions .",
    "clearly , these reductions are a consequence of the inherent symmetrical structure of the balance and constitutive equations and may therefore be recovered also by the standard methods of group analysis ; we argue however that our direct method is more simple and more revealing from a mechanical point of view .",
    "moreover , our results complement and generalize the well - known results of carroll in various directions , as already pointed out in the introduction ; they also emphasize the analogy between carroll s solutions and some exact solutions proposed for nonlinear strings by rosenau and rubin @xcite .",
    "the solutions provided here can be used not only as benchmarks for the more complicated numerical analysis required in `` real life '' applications , but also for a better understanding of the mechanical properties and of the mathematical structure of various usual models .",
    "these advantages were highlighted in the discussion on standing waves solutions conducted in section iii .",
    "there , we focused much of the discussion on the special case of standing waves for the sake of simplicity and brevity , but it is clear that our general methods of investigation can be applied to all the ordinary differential equations that were derived .",
    "one of the important findings uncovered by the analysis of our solutions is the possibility to predict the appearance of highly symmetric wrinkles in an elastic medium compressed longitudinally .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed experimentally by several researchers when , for example , a hard film is deposited on a soft material and put under compressive strain @xcite .",
    "our analysis showed that these wrinkles may indeed appear when the compression parameter satisfies some simple inequalities ; it also showed that the detailed viscoelastic behavior of the material is unimportant because of the highly attracting nature of the wrinkled states of deformations .",
    "we note of course that our solutions have a higher symmetry than the patterns usually observed in experiments , probably because our solutions are characterized by strong invariance and because they are bulk solutions , in contrast to the half - space geometry generally used in experiments . despite these limitations",
    ", we found that these solutions are compatible with the relatively simple nonlinear power - law strain energy density whereas weak non - linear theories ( up to the fourth - order ) are not adequate to predict these features .",
    "our approach allowed a direct and complete comparison of the models used in nonlinear acoustics and in continuum mechanics .",
    "it was seen that although the popular weak nonlinear theories are often used to study some special features of wave propagation , a consequence of their polynomial nature is that they can not contain all the necessary information of the general constitutive theory .",
    "last but not least , we gave some explicit solutions to some models of compressible hyperelasticity .",
    "new exact solutions are always welcomed and valuable additions to the short list of exact solutions found in the literature .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that several generalizations of our results are possible in principle .",
    "for instance , the consideration in polar coordinates of a wave propagating in the radial direction coupled to two shear waves in the axial and azimuthal direction is one of such possible generalizations . in this case",
    "the following class of motions is considered @xmath315 where @xmath316 are cylindrical polar coordinates associated with the undeformed configuration and @xmath317 are cylindrical polar coordinates associated with the deformed configuration .",
    "it is possible to show that from and the corresponding kinematical quantities of interest , the equations of motion may be reduced to a set of three partial differential equations , similar to what we did for the motions in .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that in this case the equations of motion do not allow general solutions in separable form , as was the case in section iii for the equations ) .",
    "of course , we do not exclude that for special classes of materials , it is possible to find some classes of wave solutions ( see for example @xcite for compressible materials and @xcite for incompressible materials ) .",
