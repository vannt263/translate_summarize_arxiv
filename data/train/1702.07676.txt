    "it is not hard to see that the mixed volume is symmetric and multilinear with respect to minkowski addition .",
    "also it coincides with the volume on the diagonal , i.e. @xmath16 and is invariant under translations .",
    "moreover , it satisfies the following _ monotonicity property _",

    "the criterion is especially simple when all @xmath21 are equal ( corollary  [ c : mv = v ] ) which is the situation in our application to sparse polynomial systems . in the general case of convex bodies",
    "this is still an open problem , see @xcite for special cases and conjectures .",
    "the role of mixed volumes in algebraic geometry originates in the work of bernstein , kushnirenko , and khovanskii , who gave a vast generalization of the classical bezout formula for the intersection number of hypersurfaces in the projective space , see @xcite . this beautiful result which links algebraic geometry and convex geometry through toric varieties and sparse polynomial systems",
