    "supersymmetry ( susy ) elegantly stabilizes the electroweak scale .",
    "however , susy must be broken and the susy - breaking must happen in some hidden sector and then mediated to the visible sector . in order to avoid the catastrophic flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , the mediation mechanism must be rather special .",
    "since gauge interaction is flavor blind , the gauge mediated susy - breaking ( gmsb )  @xcite can generate a flavor - universal soft spectrum and suppress fcncs .",
    "in addition to realize the minimal flavor violation ( mfv )  @xcite , the gmsb has some other virtues , e.g. , it has only a few parameters and hence very predictive .",
    "furthermore , it may accommodate the natural susy  @xcite since the stop / gluino renormalization group equation ( rge ) effect can be reduced considerably by lowering the messenger scale .",
    "the present experimental results also indirectly support the gmsb .",
    "firstly , the lhc susy search  @xcite did not find any colored sparticles .",
    "such null search results can be naturally understood in the gmsb where the squarks and gluino lie at the top of the hierarchical soft spectrum .",
    "secondly , the dark matter ( dm ) detection experiments ( like xenon100  @xcite ) have so far yielded null results .",
    "these results can be also naturally interpreted in the gmsb where the dm is the superweakly interacting gravitino .    however , the lhc hints of a sm - like higgs near 125 gev  @xcite place the minimal gmsb in an uncomfortable situation  @xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "the sm - like higgs mass @xmath6 at the tree - level is upper bounded by @xmath7 , so a large stop radiative correction is required to lift up @xmath6 : @xmath8~,~\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the average stop mass @xmath9 and the stop mixing @xmath10 . to obtain a higgs mass @xmath11 gev without multi - tev stops ( heavy stops cause severe fine - tuning and lead to null results for the future lhc search )",
    ", we should go to the maximal mixing scenario with @xmath12  @xcite . even in this ideal case",
    "@xmath13 should be close to the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "the maximal mixing scenario is hard to realize in the minimal gmsb where @xmath14 is only generated from the rge running ( mainly from the effects of the gluino mass ) which , at the same time , also increases stop masses .",
    "so it is urgent to explore some deformed gmsb which can give a large @xmath14 and/or decreased stop soft mass at the boundary .    in order to obtain a large stop mixing ,",
    "we in this work turn to the deformed gmsb with direct visible - hidden yukawa couplings ( ygmsb ) ( note that the ygmsb considered here is different from the framework proposed in @xcite , which focuses on the interactions between the messengers and another hidden sector ) .",
    "actually , the higgs - messenger couplings have been studied in the early days of the gmsb  @xcite and more recently are studied for various purposes , e.g. , dynamically solving the @xmath15problem  @xcite , making the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) with gmsb viable  @xcite , breaking a dark @xmath16 gauge symmetry  @xcite or generating the seesaw scale in neutrino physics  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will first investigate some general features of the ygmsb and then focus on the models with higgs - messenger coupling , where the mfv is automatically maintained .",
    "we find that in such models the yukawa interactions can give large @xmath1 and @xmath2 , driving the stop sector towards maximal mixing .",
    "however , this will lead to a large @xmath4 , rendering the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) inconsistent with the large stop mixing . to tackle this problem ,",
    "we explore two realistic hidden sectors by introducing a new strong gauge dynamics or using @xmath5 messengers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present some general insights into the susy breaking soft spectrum of the ygmsb and discuss the application to the mssm . in section iii",
    "we focus on the ygmsb with the higgs bridge .",
    "the discussion and conclusion are given in section iv .",
    "in appendices a and b we present some details of our calculations .",
    "in this section we first present a brief review on the basic technique used in this work and then give a general analysis for the features of the soft spectrum in the ygmsb .",
    "the soft susy - breaking effect can be treated in a supersymmetric way  @xcite and the renormalized spurion superfields ( e.g. , the wave function @xmath17 ) , which encode the susy - breaking information , can be utilized to extract the soft terms @xcite . here",
    "the crucial observation  @xcite is that , after crossing the messenger threshold @xmath18 , the wave function @xmath17 develops the @xmath19dependence through the replacement @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the spurion field parameterizing the typical scales of the hidden sector and @xmath22 characterizes the susy - breaking scale .    to illustrate the method",
    ", we consider a visible field @xmath23 with renormalized wave function @xmath24 .",
    "the kahler potential of @xmath23 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the renormalization scale .",
    "we expand @xmath24 in @xmath27 and @xmath28 and employ the field redefinition @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the scalar component of @xmath24 .",
    "now @xmath31 has a canonically normalized kinetic term and its soft mass square can be read from the coefficient of @xmath32 : @xmath33 if @xmath23 interacts with the visible matters via an operator @xmath34 , through the same manipulation we get a corresponding trilinear soft term @xmath35 with @xmath36 hereafter we define @xmath37 .    the derivatives",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 can be explicitly expressed in terms of the anomalous dimensions , the beta - functions of the couplings and their discontinuities .",
    "we formally integrate the one - loop rge @xmath40 ( @xmath41 with @xmath42 a referred scale )   is same as used in @xcite but different from  @xcite by a factor @xmath43 . ] and get @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the above quantities denoted with superscripts @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively defined above and below the messenger mass scale .",
    "then we obtain @xmath48_{\\mu = m}\\ld^2,\\\\   a_{\\ld}(\\mu   ) |_{\\mu = m } = & -\\sum_q\\delta\\gamma_{q}|_{\\mu = m}\\ld,\\label{softa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49_{\\mu = m}$ ] and @xmath50 . from the simple loop - factor counting one can find that the soft mass square and trilinear term respectively arise at the two - loop and one - loop level .    in the above derivations",
    "we have assumed that @xmath51 is a diagonal matrix in the @xmath52flavor space . in this case , it is more convenient to rewrite the derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ msf2gen ] ) with respect to @xmath53 , and redefine the beta function as @xmath54 where @xmath55 runs over all fields participating the interactions involving @xmath56 .",
    "we will use this convention in the following .",
    "the previous discussions can be directly generalized to a more general situation where @xmath51 develops non - diagonal elements  @xcite .",
    "susy should be as natural as possible and thus the mssm with light stops and gluino is preferred .",
    "however , the presence of a relatively heavy higgs around 125 gev requires rather heavy stops , which renders the fine - tuning worse than @xmath57  @xcite ( the fine - tuning can be alleviated in the nmssm  @xcite ) . for the gmsb model ,",
    "such a heavy higgs boson is even more problematic , owing to the fact that no stop trilinear soft term is generated at the boundary .",
    "so , the stop sector should be properly modified , which at the boundary should have the following features :    * a large negative @xmath14 .",
    "the negative sign is important and the reason can be explicitly found from the following discussions ( see eq .",
    "[ at ] ) , i.e. , if the initial @xmath58 and @xmath14 have opposite sign , at the weak scale @xmath59 will receive an enhancement from @xmath58 .",
    "* reduced stop soft mass squares relative to the first and second family squarks .",
    "this helps to achieve the maximal stop mixing scenario with a relatively light stop sector .    in the following",
    "we will show that they can be elegantly realized in the framework of ygmsb .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the ygsmb has been used in different circumstances .",
    "the basic features of its soft spectrum are of crucial importance , especially the signs of the soft terms which are relevant to the discussion in this work .",
    "we simplify the discussion by ignoring the gauge interaction at the moment , which is valid in the large yukawa coupling limit .",
    "in fact , the gauge interaction contribution only appears in the beta functions , taking the form of @xmath60 , and thus it can be easily traced back when necessary .    through yukawa interactions , the visible fields",
    "@xmath61 can couple to the messengers @xmath62 in two ways : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the field which directly couples to the messengers is dubbed as the bridge field , denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "then the general ygmsb takes a form of the wess - zumino model : @xmath66 here we use @xmath67 for the bridge field indices , @xmath68 for messenger indices while @xmath69 for the light field indices ( the light fields are the visible fields which couples to @xmath65 unless specified otherwise ) .",
    "moreover , each letter used to label the yukawa coupling type is specified , e.g. , @xmath56 is used to label the type with two - bridges and one - messenger .",
    "the light fields soft terms are given by @xmath70 where we have omitted the soft mass terms .",
    "( [ general ] ) , the bridge field @xmath65 first encodes the susy - breaking information in its one - loop wave function .",
    "then through yukawa interactions , the information is mediated to the light field @xmath71 . in this picture",
    ", the chiral field @xmath65 essentially plays the role of a force mediator , while in the pure gmsb the vector superfield is the mediator .",
    "this difference will lead to a remarkable difference in the soft terms between the gmsb and ygmsb .",
    "based on eqs .",
    "( [ msf2gen ] ) and ( [ softa ] ) , now we present an analysis for the structure of the soft terms from the yukawa mediation .",
    "we will emphasize the signs of various terms as well as the possible cancelations between them .",
    "first of all , it is noticed that the yukawa interactions contribute positively to the anomalous dimension . as a result ,",
    "after the decoupling of the bridge - messenger interactions , we get @xmath72 for bridges and @xmath73 for the light fields .",
    "using these properties , some inferences can be obtained :    * in light of eq .",
    "( [ softa ] ) , the @xmath74term , which only depends on the discontinuities of the bridge fields @xmath75 , always takes a negative sign .",
    "* the anomalous dimension of the light field is smooth when it crosses the messenger threshold .",
    "then , in terms of eq .",
    "( [ msf2gen ] ) , only the second term which comes from the discontinuities of @xmath76 contributes to @xmath77 : @xmath78 so it is definitely negative .",
    "these two features are the main guidelines for the model building in this work .",
    "the soft mass square of the bridge field is much more involved due to its dual identities : it is not only the force mediator but also a light field . therefore , its soft mass square @xmath79 receives two kinds of contributions , as shown from eq .",
    "( [ msf2gen ] ) .",
    "the subtle points come from the potential cancellations which will be discussed later .",
    "but since our primary interest is the general structure of @xmath79 , we can explicitly find its expression , with details presented in appendix  [ wess ] . from the general expression ,",
    "we can decompose it into the following three parts ( with a common factor @xmath80 factored out ) :    1 .",
    "the quartic terms of the visible - hidden coupling constants : @xmath81 .",
    "they are definitely positive and generically dominant in @xmath82 in the large @xmath83 limit .",
    "the cross terms @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( repeating index will be summed in the following unless specified otherwise ) : @xmath86 where @xmath87 with only the index @xmath88 summed over , and other quantities are defined similarly .",
    "remarkably , the term @xmath85 always takes the negative sign , implying that if we work in a model with a proper structure , the dominant term given in the first item can be reduced . as a case in point , in the nmssm with the singlet coupling to messengers ,",
    "such a cancelation is important to trigger the ewsb  @xcite .",
    "the cross terms @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 : @xmath92 whether or not the terms in the bracket can cancel is model dependent , but the third and last terms take definite signs . anyway , using the general formula given in appendix  [ wess ] it is easy to get the soft mass squares in a given model .",
    "note that the term @xmath93 vanishes as a result of cancellation .    in concrete models some yukawa couplings will be turned off and thus the expressions can be greatly simplified . in the following",
    "the first and third item will be the focuses of our discussion .    before ending this section",
    ", we remind that the wave function renormalization method can not be used to extract the one - loop contribution for the soft mass square of @xmath65 .",
    "actually , it is model - dependent  @xcite and usually vanishes at the leading order of susy - breaking , say suppressed by @xmath94  @xcite . in the following discussions we will ignore such a contribution .",
    "restricting our discussions within the mssm and considering the phenomenological requirements , we classify the models into two basic types .",
    "one type contains matter bridges , especially the @xmath95 field , and the other type contains higgs fields as the only bridges .",
    "here we consider the first type .",
    "the minimal messengers under consideration are @xmath96 pairs of vector - like particles , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 carry the same sm gauge group charges as @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "@xmath103 forms a complete multiplet of the @xmath104 grand unification theory ( gut ) .",
    "the sm gauge invariance allows for the following general superpotential @xmath105 where the first term denotes the ordinary hidden sector and @xmath106 consists of the mssm yukawa interactions @xmath107 .",
    "the visible - hidden yukawa couplings take the form of @xmath108 with the dots being the couplings involving leptons .",
    "the terms in @xmath109 are similar to the models studied in @xcite , where @xmath109 is due to the ( large ) higgs - messenger mixings .",
    "@xmath110 is a generalization of the higgs - messenger mixing to the matter - messenger mixing .",
    "in such kind of models the dangerous high - dimensional operators , which may induce fast proton decay , could be forbidden with the help of additional symmetries .",
    "the direct visible - hidden couplings may incur large flavor violations and undermine the original motivation of the gmsb .",
    "however , according to our above general analysis , the dangerous fcncs can be avoided if the flavor structure in @xmath111 is such that the same set of messengers only significantly couple to one single family of matters .",
    "for example , in the context of messenger - higgs mixing  @xcite , the flavor structure in @xmath109 is identical to the mssm counterpart , i.e. , @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , effectively only the third family couples to the messengers due to the family hierarchy of the sm yukawa couplings . actually , the flavor violations in this kind of models respect the mfv .",
    "we would like to point out that the ygmsb potentially is able to provide a natural susy spectrum  @xcite without fcnc problems .",
    "this is realized by taking the first two families of matters as bridges which couple to the messengers : @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the matter superfields in the @xmath104 model . in a complete model ,",
    "a flavor symmetry should naturally account for the above yukawa coupling structure .",
    "provided that @xmath116 , then according to the analysis in section  [ feature ] , the sfermion masses of the first two generations obtain large and dominant positive contributions from the yukawa mediation .",
    "but the third generation sfermion masses still originate from the ordinary gmsb , and can be much lighter than the first two generations of sfermions .",
    "this kind of realization of natural susy may be easier than those in  @xcite .",
    "in the following we turn our attention to the main point of this work , namely the second type in which the higgs bridges the visible and hidden sectors .",
    "one of the main features of this type is that the resulted soft terms automatically satisfy the mfv since here the small sfermion flavor violations originate from the flavor violations in the sm .",
    "for example , the up - type squark mass squares take the form of @xmath117 with @xmath118 being the @xmath119-messenger yukawa couplings . in the proceeding section",
    "we discuss in depth this type of models and study their phenomenological features .",
    "we will start from a toy model and then propose two simple modifications on the hidden sector to obtain the realistic ygmsb with higgs bridge .",
    "to show the main features of the @xmath0ygmsb , we start from a toy model .",
    "first of all , in order to couple the higgs fields with the messengers , the minimal messenger content must be extended . for this purpose ,",
    "two sm singlets @xmath120 are introduced and they couple to the goldstino superfield via @xmath121 .",
    "then the higgs - messenger couplings are @xmath122 such a structure originally is motivated by the possible solution to the @xmath15problem  @xcite .",
    "but here we do not try to solve this problem , and instead evade it by turning off @xmath123 ( which is not an important parameter in this work ) and treat @xmath124 as free parameters .",
    "alternatively , one can just introduce one singlet and get the coupling @xmath125 the basic features of these two models in eq.([wh ] ) and eq.([wh - prime ] ) are quite similar , as shown in appendix  [ second ] .",
    "however , we find that @xmath126 is more preferred for building realistic models . therefore , in the following we focus on @xmath126 (",
    "recently some aspects of @xmath127 were studied in @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to make a comment .",
    "a proper symmetry should be introduced to guarantee that the messengers only couple to the higgs rather than the matters",
    ". it does not give rise to a new problem , since it amounts to how to distinguish the higgs and matters , e.g , @xmath128 and @xmath102 , which also should be addressed in the mssm .",
    "the well - known solution is imposing some symmetry such as the @xmath129parity , @xmath130 or @xmath131 , etc .",
    ", on the model .    to calculate the soft spectrum in the ygmsb , we should work out the discontinuities of the anomalous dimensions of the relevant fields . above the messenger scale @xmath18",

    "are obtained from the corresponding @xmath139 by setting @xmath140 .",
    "then , with eq .",
    "( [ dis : toy ] ) , the yukawa - mediated susy - breaking soft terms can be calculated in light of eq .",
    "( [ msf2gen ] ) . in the following",
    "we present them and analyze their implications .",
    "we look at the stop sector which is of our main interest . compared to the situation in the pure gmsb , it is modified towards the desired form outlined at the beginning of this section even if we work in the @xmath0ygmsb with a single term @xmath141 .",
    "first , at the one - loop level a large negative @xmath14 is generated at the boundary @xmath142 note that they are universal to three generations .",
    "next , the stops , together with other third family sfermions , obtain sizable negative contributions : @xmath143 by contrast , the yukawa - mediation contributions to the first two families of sfermions are negligible since they couple to the higgs very weakly .    given the above modifications to the stop sector , the maximal mixing scenario can be realized in this toy model .",
    "taking into account the rge effect , the weak - scale stop parameters can be parameterized as  @xcite @xmath144 where the quantities in the right side are defined at the scale @xmath18 ( hereafter we will use this convention for the rge effect estimations ) .",
    "in addition , the stop sector trilinear term takes the form of @xmath145 in the above equations , @xmath146 are positive numbers , determined by the mssm yukawa and gauge couplings as well as @xmath18 .",
    "there are hierarchies @xmath147 and @xmath148 : in the low scale @xmath18 limit , @xmath149 while others are negligible ; as @xmath18 increases ( say to @xmath150 gev ) , @xmath151 are reduced no more than half , but @xmath152 are generated at @xmath153 . note that for a high scale @xmath18 the gluino effect is significant and roughly @xmath154 . with these approximate features",
    "we simplify eq .",
    "( [ stop : weak ] ) as @xmath155 where the @xmath156 terms approximately measure the @xmath157gmsb and gluino contributions .",
    "we now can see how the @xmath0ygmsb accommodates the maximal stop mixing .",
    "it is noticed that in the stop mass square matrix the difference between the diagonal entries is @xmath158 , which is much larger than the non - diagonal entries @xmath159 .",
    "consequently , its heavier and lighter eigenvalues can be approximated to be @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "and then the degree of mixing is estimated as @xmath162^{-1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the term @xmath163 has been neglected .",
    "considering a quite low scale @xmath18 , we then get @xmath164 with good approximation .",
    "since @xmath118 is only allowed to be mildly larger than the gauge coupling of @xmath137 due to the bound @xmath165 , the maximal mixing @xmath166 requires an enhancement from @xmath167 .",
    "this enhancement comes from the negative stop soft mass square contributions from the @xmath0ygmsb .",
    "so , our scenario is quite different from the one proposed in the top - bridge models  @xcite where the stop soft mass squares are increased and thus one needs a rather large @xmath59 ( then a rather large @xmath118 ) , to lift up @xmath168 . in our higgs - bridge model the condition @xmath166 can be realized while a light stop is maintained , which is favored by naturalness .",
    "note that we introduce a new fine - tuning at the boundary , namely the cancellation between the gauge- and yukawa - contributions to the stop soft mass squares .",
