    "controlling light - matter interfaces is essential to further develop optical quantum information processing elements .",
    "optical quantum memories are one of the primary goals of this development , and their applications  @xcite are likely to extend beyond their role in quantum repeaters  @xcite .",
    "many recent efforts have been devoted to their implementation in atomic ensembles  @xcite , and in particular , memories compatible with ultrafast light are desirable for their large time - bandwidth products and fast operational speeds  @xcite .",
    "absorbing broadband photons in atomic ensembles requires either a controlled inhomogeneous broadening of the atomic transition or an off - resonant raman interaction , such as raman memories  @xcite , atomic frequency combs  @xcite , and gradient echo memories ( gems )  @xcite .",
    "this latter approach uses a longitudinal controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening of the transition frequency of the medium to control the photon storage and retrieval  @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous broadening is induced by a spatial gradient in an external static field and modifies the transition frequency of the atoms .",
    "if the broadening is reversed , the time - reversal symmetry of the maxwell - bloch equations predicts that the absorbed light is subsequently re - emitted  @xcite .",
    "gems have been realized with a spatially - dependent linear stark or zeeman shift in rare - earth - doped crystals and warm atomic vapors  @xcite .",
    "the strength and reversal timescale of the external field impose technical and fundamental limitations on the operational bandwidth of the gem , and consequently the experimental demonstrations have remained limited to microsecond - duration pulses .",
    "@xcite showed that having a propagation medium with a linear time - dependent refractive index is equivalent to the longitudinal ( spatial ) inhomogeneous broadening in a gem .",
    "the time - dependent refractive index can be generated in a host crystal exposed to a varying electric field , and induces a linear spatially - dependent frequency shift in the propagating signal pulse that mimics the effect of a varying resonance atomic frequency .",
    "this scheme relies on the temporal modulation of an external electric field which can not be switched quickly enough to store ultrafast photons .    in this paper",
    ", we employ molecular alignment techniques to engineer the ultrafast refractive index dynamics necessary for storing femtosecond pulses in an atomic ensemble .",
    "molecular alignment is a well - studied phenomenon  @xcite where a non - resonant ultrafast laser pulse impulsively generates a coherent excitation in the rotational levels of an ensemble of molecules via the dynamic stark effect  @xcite .",
    "it has been used to shape light pulses  @xcite , dissociate diatomic molecules  @xcite , in optical imaging  @xcite , and for quantum control scenarios  @xcite .",
    "we propose to use such an interaction in a gaseous host medium containing diatomic molecules and two - level atoms ( _ e.g. _ warm atomic vapor ) to optically prepare refractive index dynamics which can be used for a gem - type storage and retrieval of ultrafast photons . as a proof - of - principle",
    ", we numerically simulate this interaction for the case of a mixed co@xmath1/@xmath2rb gas , and store the signal using the d@xmath3 transition ( 795 nm ) of @xmath2rb atoms  @xcite .",

    "( ii ) ( _ absorption _ ) by choosing an appropriate pump - signal delay , the weak signal pulse propagates in a region in time where the refractive index is approximately linear , _ i.e. _ @xmath5 .",
    "this evenly shifts the frequency distribution of the signal pulse by an amount at least equal to its bandwidth ( for a sufficient @xmath6 ) , thereby scanning all its frequency components over the transition frequency of two - level atoms such that the entire pulse can be absorbed .",
    "( iii ) ( _ emission _ ) later in time , oscillations in the rotational dynamics of the molecules generate the opposite slope in the refractive index of the propagation medium , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath7 .",

    "molecules ( blue ) and @xmath2rb atoms ( pink ) .",
    "step 1 : the pump generates time - dependent molecular alignment , which causes a corresponding time - dependent refractive index @xmath4 in the medium . step 2 : the delayed signal pulse experiences the @xmath4 as it propagates through the medium . for specific delays",
    ", the @xmath4 causes the bandwidth of the signal to be scanned across the atomic resonance and thus absorbed in the two - level atoms .",
    "step 3 : ( not shown ) at a later time , the @xmath4 is reversed due to the natural rotational dynamics of the aligned molecules , and this reversal of @xmath4 causes the re - emission of the signal . ]",

    "we plot the refractive index as the deviation from unity @xmath53 .",
    "the bandwidth of the pump should not overlap with the two - level atomic transition at 795 nm , which could be readily achieved by using a wavelength in the 1 - 2@xmath61 m regime .",
    "we note that our chosen density @xmath43 represents a pressure of @xmath6240bar which is achievable in a high - pressure gas cell .",
    "the oscillations seen in fig .  [ fig : alignment]a , which are called rotational revivals @xcite , reflect the rotational alignment dynamics of the molecules : the peaks ( dips ) in @xmath4 correspond to moments in time where the molecules are preferentially aligned parallel ( perpendicular ) to the polarization direction of the pump . by changing the delay between the pump and signal pulses , we select a region within @xmath4 with the desired shape , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alignment]b and fig .",

    "[ pulse ] to be the amplitude of a single photon occupying a mode volume defined by interaction distance and the pulse spot size .",

    "this causes the signal to be frequency - shifted , as shown in ( b ) : as the signal propagates , its frequency distribution is scanned over the transition wavelength ( 795 nm ) of the two - level atoms such that the entire broadband pulse is absorbed .",
    "the linear slope of the refractive index eventually switches and the pulse is re - emitted from the medium , and again frequency - shifted , but in the opposite direction .",
    "thus the dynamics of the refractive index cause the signal to be absorbed and then re - emitted from the medium with a delay @xmath8 that defines the storage time of the memory . ]    the linear time - dependent refractive index in the medium causes a spatially - dependent frequency shift ( see fig .  [ fig : o2_memory]b ) .",
    "the propagation distance required for the signal to be shifted by its entire bandwidth is determined by the slope of @xmath4 . for our parameters ,",
    "we require a propagation distance of @xmath621 cm . because the pulse propagates in a region where the refractive index is linear , the gaussian shape of the frequency distribution is preserved as the pulse is frequency - shifted . as the signal",
    "is scanned over the transition wavelength of the two - level atoms ( 795 nm ) , it is completely absorbed for sufficiently high optical depths ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : efficiency ] , here we use @xmath66@xmath58 and @xmath67 = 2.99 @xmath68 ) .",
    "we assume the two - level atoms have a negligible linewidth relative to the timescale of refractive index dynamics , and hence ignore relaxation processes ( @xmath69 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : bloch ] ) .",
    "after some delay , which we here choose to label as @xmath8 , the rotational dynamics of the molecules causes the refractive index gradient to switch ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : alignment]b ) , and the signal is re - emitted from the medium , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2_memory]a .",
    "note that the opposite gradient in @xmath4 also causes the emitted light to be frequency - shifted in the opposite direction , towards its initial distribution . the storage time is set by @xmath8 , and in this simulation @xmath70 300fs .",
    "the fringes in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2_memory]b are due to the fact that the absorbed and emitted pulses are two identical gaussian functions separated by a time delay @xmath8 , which in fourier space transforms to a phase term @xmath71 , and thus yields fringes whose spacing is given by the inverse of the storage time of the memory .    the timescale of the linear region of the refractive index oscillation in fig .",
    "[ fig : alignment]b sets the maximum length of the signal pulse , which in the case of co@xmath1 is roughly 150fs .",
    "we note that this is not a limitation of the scheme as molecular alignment can be achieved with many different molecules : oscillations in @xmath4 depend on the moment of inertia of the molecule being aligned . for instance , a heavier molecule such as br@xmath1 will rotate more slowly and hence the refractive index it generates will also have slower oscillations .",
    "one could also consider using adiabatic alignment @xcite as an alternative to impulsive alignment since the former operates with picosecond pump pulses .",
    "optical control of the molecular alignment process provides additional versatility to this scheme .",
    "for example , undesired dynamics in the alignment , such as the small oscillation at 32.5ps in fig .",
    "[ fig : alignment]c , can be minimized by temporal shaping of the pump pulse .",
    "although we numerically verified that the slope in this feature is insufficient to cause re - emission of the pulse ( not shown ) , it does affects the specific re - emission time at the subsequent revival at @xmath6243ps .",
    "the memory scheme we have presented above effectively operates as a delay line with a fixed storage time .",
    "however , it can be extended to support variable storage times .",
    "it is possible to attenuate and regenerate the rotational revivals by using additional control pulses  @xcite .",
    "control over the alignment revival dynamics is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : control_revivals ] . here , the initial alignment revivals generated by the pump pulse ( seen in fig .  [ fig : control_revivals ] , same revivals as shown in fig .  2(a ) ) are attenuated using a control pulse positioned at 21.45 ps ( b)-(d ) .",
    "recall that @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath72 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqnoft ] ) .",
    "the attenuating control pulse is identical to the initial pump pulse .",
    "this control pulse applies a torque to the molecules just as they are rotating toward the equatorial plane , and stops the rotations generated by the first pump pulse .",
    "the rotational distribution of angular momentum states is then effectively returned to the initial thermal distribution .",
    "the rotational revivals can now be regenerated at a later time .",
    "for example , in figs .",
    "[ fig : control_revivals](c ) and ( d ) , the revivals are regenerated using a final control pulse ( again identical to the first pump pulse ) positioned at 40 ps and 70 ps , respectively .",
    "we now demonstrate controllable read times for the memory scheme using this control over the alignment revivals .",
    "[ fig : control_read ] shows example calculations where the read time has been set to three different values .",
    "these calculations use a medium length of 4 cm and an atomic density of @xmath73@xmath58 .",
    "all remaining parameters are the same as used in fig.[fig : o2_memory ] .",
    "consider first figs .",
    "[ fig : control_read](a)-(c ) . in these cases ,",
    "the 50 fs signal pulse ( red ) arrives at 21.3 ps and is stored in the memory using the falling edge of concomitant revival .",
    "this revival is then immediately attenuated with a control pulse positioned at 21.45 ps .",
    "panels ( a)-(c ) show cases where the stored signal is then read out at three different times .",
    "the read - out is triggered by regenerating the revivals at times 30 , 35 , and 40 ps respectively using a final control pulse .",
    "the re - emitted signal pulses are shown in green .",
    "in the plots , the re - emitted pulses are seen to lag a bit ( on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 ps ) behind the read - out revival .",
    "this occurs because , once re - emitted , the signal pulse propagates in a region of @xmath4 that has a higher value than the pump pulse , and hence the re - emitted signal starts to lag behind the alignment revivals which are propagating with the speed of the pump .",
    "figures  [ fig : control_read](e)-(g ) show a closer view of the emitted signal pulses ( green ) , together with a time - shifted copy of the initial signal pulse ( red ) for comparison .",
    "the re - emitted signals are seen to be broader in time as compare to the initial signal .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath4 is not perfectly linear ; the non - linear components of @xmath4 add dispersion to the propagation and effectively add chirp the signal .",
    "also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : control_read](e)-(g ) is a small post - pulse , which is a leakage process of the memory . for these cases",
    ", we also calculate the efficicency @xmath74 of the memory by integrating over the intensities in the main part of the signal @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the intensities of the output ( emitted ) and input ( stored ) signal pulses .",
    "the integration region over the main part of the output pulse , @xmath78 to @xmath79 , is labeled explicitely in fig .",
    "[ fig : control_read](e ) , while in figs  [ fig : control_read](f)-(g ) we denoted this region by the vertical dashed lines alone .",
    "the resulting efficiencies are shown as percentages in ( e)-(g ) and are between 84% to 87% . although not seen clearly , part of the deviation from 100% efficiency is due to less than perfect efficiency in the write step .",
    "these examples show a quantum photonic memory that stores a 50 fs pulse for about 20 ps , giving a time - bandwidth product of approximately 20 ps / 0.05 ps = 400 .",
    "the largest storage times acheivable is limited by the @xmath40 time of the two - level atoms , typically on the order of one nanosecond . for a 50 fs pulse",
    ", this leads to a time - bandwidth product of order @xmath80 .      .",
    "high optical depths are required as the scheme involves storing large bandwidth pulses in an atomic transition with a narrow linewidth . ]",
    "the efficiency of the quantum memory is plotted as a function of optical depth in fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency ] .",
    "the optical depth of the system is modified due to the effective inhomogeneous broadening of the medium . if we assume the refractive index varies linearly in the region where the pulse is absorbed and emitted , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath81 , then the optical depth is given by  @xcite @xmath82 in the regime where @xmath46 .",
    "a substantial optical depth is required for high efficiency as the atomic ensemble is absorbing large - bandwidth pulses with a very narrow linewidth .",
    "such optical depths have been achieved in hollow - core fibers containing warm atomic vapors  @xcite . with this in mind , it is reasonable to use the d@xmath3 transition of an ensemble of @xmath2rb atoms in a warm atomic vapor state for the gaseous atoms .",
    "the lifetime of this transition is on the order of nanoseconds and as such can be neglected in eq .",
    "[ eqn : bloch ] .",
    "furthermore , we also note that room temperature diatomic molecules can be aligned in hollow - core fibers  @xcite . compared to the above simulations that model a high - pressure cell regime , implementing the memory in a hollow - core fiber would force a lower molecular density @xmath43 and hence would require a longer propagation length on the order of 1 m .",
    "thus the proposed scheme could be achieved in either a high - pressure gas cell a hollow - core fiber or containing a mix of a diatomic gas and a warm atomic vapor .",
    "in summary , we explore the possibility of implementing a gem - type quantum memory for ultrafast photons using molecular alignment to generate a time - dependent refractive index  @xcite : a linear refractive index is used to scan the frequency distribution of a broadband photon over the transition frequency of an ensemble of two - level atoms such that entire photon is absorbed . later in time ,",
    "the rotating molecules generate the opposite gradient in the refractive index and the photon is re - emitted .",
    "we numerically demonstrate that the proposed scheme can store a weak 50-fs pulse for 400 times its duration in a gas mixture of @xmath2rb ( warm atomic ) vapor and co@xmath1 molecules at room temperature .",
    "this is achieved without the use of an external static field as required in previous gem schemes . by exploiting the revival dynamics of the rotational wave packet generated in the alignment process along with additional control pulses",
    ", we envisage that the lifetime of such a memory can be extended to @xmath40 timescales of @xmath2rb , leading to time - bandwidth products of order @xmath83 .",
    "the proposed scheme explores one possible way of implementing an optical quantum memory in a medium with an ultrafast time - dependent refractive index . inducing refractive index changes with ultrafast response times is also achievable via other mechanisms , such as the non - linear response of the electronic polarization of the medium  @xcite and in particular cross - phase modulation  @xcite .",
