    "wide - scale redshift surveys such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey and sloan digital sky survey ( 2dfgrs , colless  2001b ; sdss , york   2001 ) have made significant advances in our understanding of the matter and structure of the wider universe .",
    "these include the precise determination of the luminosity function of galaxies (  folkes   1999 , cross  2001 , cole  2001 , blanton  2001 , madgwick  2002 , norberg  2002 , blanton  2003 ) , the space density of nearby rich galaxy clusters ( de propris  2002 , goto  2003 ) , and large - scale structure formation and mass density ( peacock  2001 , percival  2001 , efstathiou  2002 , verde  2002 , lahav  2002 , zehavi  2002 , hawkins   2003 , szalay  2003 ) .",
    "while such surveys have also greatly refined our view of the local universe , better determination of several key parameters can be made where a knowledge of galaxy mass can be combined with redshift .",
    "the 2dfgrs and sdss surveys are both optically - selected , inevitably biasing them in favour of currently star - forming galaxies .",
    "the 2df and sloan spectrographs also have fields of view too small to allow full sky coverage in realistic timescales , limiting their utility for dynamical and cosmographic studies .",
    "the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) is a dual redshift / peculiar velocity survey that endeavours to overcome the limitations of the 2dfgrs and sdss surveys in these areas .    the primary sample for the 6dfgs is selected in the @xmath8 band from the 2mass survey ( jarrett  2000 ) .",
    "the magnitudes used in the selection are estimated total magnitudes .",
    "these features combined mean that the primary sample is as unbiased a picture of the universe , in terms of the old stellar content of galaxies , as is possible at the current time .",
    "the near - infrared selection also enables the survey to probe closer to the galactic equator before extinction becomes an issue ; the survey covers the entire southern sky with @xmath5 .",
    "the redshift of a galaxy includes both recessional and peculiar velocity components , so that a redshift survey alone does not furnish a true three - dimensional distribution for the galaxies .",
    "however , by measuring these components separately , it is possible to determine the three - dimensional distributions of both the galaxies and the underlying mass .",
    "observationally , significantly greater effort is required to obtain the distances and peculiar velocities of galaxies than their redshifts .",
    "distance estimators based on the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies ( fp ; dressler  1987 , djorgovski & davis 1987 ) , as used in the 6dfgs , require measurements of the galaxies internal velocity dispersions .",
    "velocity dispersions demand a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the spectrum at least 3 to 5 times higher than redshift measurements .",
    "furthermore , the fp distance estimators need such spectroscopy to be supported by photometry which can be used to determine the galaxies surface brightness profiles .",
    "we measure peculiar velocities as the discrepancy between the redshift and the estimated distance . for realistic cosmologies ,",
    "peculiar velocities increase weakly with distance , but remain @xmath9 .",
    "redshift errors are small , and have little or no dependence on distance . on the other hand ,",
    "all existing distance estimators have significant , intrinsic and fractional , uncertainties in distance ; for the fp estimators this uncertainty is typically about 20% for a single galaxy measurement .",
    "this linear increase in the errors with distance , compared with more or less fixed peculiar velocities , means that the uncertainty on a single peculiar velocity becomes dominated by the intrinsic uncertainties at redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , all previous peculiar velocity surveys have traced the velocity field , and hence the mass distribution , only out to distances of about 5000  ( for relatively dense field samples of individual galaxies ;  dressler  1987 , giovanelli 1998 , da costa  2000 ) or 15000  ( for relatively sparse cluster samples , where distances for multiple galaxies are combined ;  lauer and postman 1994 , hudson  1999 , colless 2001a ) .",
    "the smaller volumes are highly subject to cosmic variance , while the larger volumes are too sparsely sampled to reveal much information about the velocity field . in order to differentiate cosmological models , and constrain their parameters ,",
    "both the survey volume and galaxy sampling need to be significantly increased . moreover , since peculiar velocities amount to at most a few per cent of the velocity over much of the volume , both the underlying sample and the direct distance estimates have to be extraordinarily homogeneous , preferably involving unchanging telescopes , instrumental set ups and procedures in each case .",
    "the two facets of the 6df galaxy survey are a redshift survey of 150000  galaxies over the southern sky , and a peculiar velocity survey of a subset of some 15000 of these galaxies .",
    "the aims of the redshift survey are : ( 1 )  to take a near - infrared selected sample of galaxies and determine their luminosity function as a function of environment and galaxy type . from these ,",
    "the stellar mass function and mean stellar fraction of the local universe can be ascertained and compared to the integrated stellar mass inferred from measures of cosmic star formation history .",
    "( 2 )  to measure galaxy clustering on both small and large scales and its relation to stellar mass . in doing so",
    ", the 6dfgs will provide new insight into the scale - dependence of galaxy biasing and its relationship to dark matter .",
    "( 3 )  to determine the power spectrum of this galaxy clustering on scales similar to those spanned by the 2df galaxy redshift survey and sloan digital sky surveys . ( 4 )  to delineate the distribution of galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "the 6dfgs will not cover as many galaxies as either the 2df galaxy redshift survey or sloan digital sky survey .",
    "however , because it is a large - volume survey of nearby galaxies , it provides the ideal sample on which to base a peculiar velocity survey . in this respect",
    ", the complete 6dfgs will be more than ten times larger in number and span twice the volume of the pscz survey ( saunders  2000 ) , previously the largest survey of the local universe .",
    "( 5 )  to furnish a complete redshift catalogue for future studies in this regime .",
    "as discussed above , precise distance measures impose stronger demands on signal - to - noise than do redshifts . with such higher quality spectra ,",
    "it is also possible to infer properties of the underlying stellar population , such as ages and chemical abundances . having such measurements along with the galaxy mass and knowledge of its local envrionment ,",
    "will afford unprecedented opportunities to understand the processes driving galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this redshift catalogue will provide the basis for a volume - limited sample of early - type galaxies for the peculiar velocity survey .",
    "the aims of the peculiar velocity survey are : ( 1 )  a detailed mapping of the density and peculiar velocity fields to around 15000 over half the local volume .",
    "( 2 )  the inference of the ages , metallicities and star - formation histories of e / s0 galaxies from the most massive systems down to dwarf galaxies .",
    "the influence of local galaxy density on these parameters will also be of key interest to models of galaxy formation .",
    "( 3 )  to understand the bias of galaxies ( number density versus total mass density field ) and its variation with galaxy parameters and environment .",
    "one novel feature of the 6df galaxy survey compared to earlier redshift and peculiar velocity surveys is its near - infrared source selection .",
    "the main target catalogues are selected from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; jarrett  2000 ) using total galaxy magnitudes in @xmath11 .",
    "there are several advantages of choosing galaxies in these bands .",
    "first , the near - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies are dominated by the light of their oldest stellar populations , and hence , the bulk of their stellar mass .",
    "traditionally , surveys have selected target galaxies in the optical where galaxy seds are dominated by younger , bluer stars .",
    "second , the e / s0 galaxies that will provide the best targets for fundamental plane peculiar velocity measures represent the largest fraction by galaxy type of near - infrared - selected samples . finally , the effects of dust extinction are minimal at long wavelengths . in the target galaxies",
    ", this means that the total near - infrared luminosity is not dependent on galaxy orientation and so provides a reliable measure of galaxy mass . in our own galaxy",
    ", it means the 6dfgs can map the local universe nearer to the plane of the milky way than would otherwise be possible through optical selection .",
    "in this paper we describe the key components contributing to the realisation of the 6df galaxy survey .",
    "section  [ sec : instrument ] describes the six - degree field instrument ; section  [ sec : design ] details the compilation of the input catalogues and the optimal placement of fields and fibres on sources therein ; section  [ sec : implementation ] outlines the methods used to obtain and reduce the spectra , and derive redshifts from them ; section  [ sec : datarelease ] summarises the first data release of 46474  unique galaxy redshifts and describes the 6df galaxy survey on - line database ; section  [ sec : conclusions ] provides concluding remarks .",
    "central to the 6dfgs is the six - degree field multi - object fibre spectroscopy facility , ( hereafter referred to as 6df ) , constructed by the anglo - australian observatory ( aao ) and operated on the united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) .",
    "this instrument has three major components : ( 1 ) an @xmath12-@xmath13 robotic fibre positioner , ( 2 ) two interchangeable 6df field plates that contain the fibres to be positioned , and ( 3 ) a fast schmidt spectrograph that accepts the fibre - slit from a 6df field plate .",
    "the process of 6df operation involves configuring a 6df field plate on target objects , mounting this configured plate at the focal surface of the ukst and feeding the output target fibre bundle into an off telescope spectrograph .",
    "while one target field is being observed the other field plate can be configured .",
    "6df can obtain up to 150 simultaneous spectra across the 5.7-diameter field of the ukst .",
    "fuller descriptions of the 6df instrument have been given elsewhere , ( parker  1998 , watson   2000 , saunders  2001 ) ; here we summarise only those features important to the galaxy survey .",
    "the 6df positioner , though building on the expertise and technology successfully developed and employed in the aao s 2df facility ( lewis  2002 ) , and in previous incarnations of fibre - fed spectrographs at the ukst such as flair ( parker & watson 1995 ) , is nevertheless a significant departure in both concept and operation .",
    "6df employs an @xmath12-@xmath13 robotic fibre positioner constructed as a working proto - type for the ozpoz fibre positioner built under contract by the aao and now commissioned on the european southern observatory very large telescope .",
    "this fibre - placement technology can place fibre - buttons directly and accurately onto the convex focal surface of the ukst , via a curved radial arm matched to the focal surface .",
    "this is coupled with a complete @xmath14 @xmath13-travel and with a pneumatically controlled fibre - gripper travelling in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "gripper positioning is honed ( to @xmath16 m ) using an inbuilt small ccd camera to permit centroid measurement from back - illuminated images of each fibre .",
    "unlike 2df , the 6df positioning robot is off - telescope , in a special enclosure on the dome floor .",
    "two identical field plate units are available , which allows one to be mounted on the telescope taking observations whilst the other is being configured by the 6df robot .",
    "each field plate contains a ring of 154 fibre buttons comprising 150 science fibres and four bundles of guide fibres all arranged around the curved field plate .",
    "each 100@xmath17 m ( 6.7 ) science fibre is terminated at the input end by a 5 mm diameter circular button , containing an elongated sf2 prism to deflect the light into the fibre and a strong rare - earth magnet for adhesion to the field plate .",
    "targets closer than @xmath18 on the sky can not be simultaneously configured due to the clearances required to avoid collisions and interference between buttons . the buttons and trailing fibres are incorporated into individual retractors housed within the main body of the field plate under slight elastic tension .",
    "the 150 target fibres feed into a fibre cable wrap 11 metres long , and terminate in a fibre slit - block mounted in the 6df spectrograph .",
    "a full field configuration takes around 30 - 40 minutes depending on target disposition and target numbers , plus about half this time to park any prior configuration .",
    "this is less than the time spent by a configured field plate in the telescope of 1.5 - 2.5 hours ( depending on conditions ) .",
    "there is however a @xmath19 minute overhead between fields , needed for parking the telescope , taking arcs and flats , manually unloading and loading the field plates , taking new arcs and flats , and acquiring the new field .",
    "the acquisition is via four guide fibres , each consisting of 7 @xmath20 100@xmath17 m fibres hexagonally packed to permit direct imaging from four guide stars across the field plate .",
    "the guide fibres proved extremely fragile in use , and also hard to repair until a partial redesign in 2002 ; as a result of this a significant fraction of the data was acquired with three , or occasionally even two , guide fibres , with consequent loss of acquisition accuracy and signal - to - noise .",
    "the spectrograph is essentially the previous bench - mounted flair ii instrument but upgraded with new gratings , ccd detector and other refinements .",
    "the instrument uses a @xmath21  pixel marconi ccd47 - 10 device , with 13@xmath17 m pixels .",
    "all 6dfgs data taken prior to october 2002 used 600v and 316r reflection gratings , covering 4000 ",
    "5600  and 5500  8400  respectively .",
    "subsequent data uses volume - phase transmissive holographic ( vph ) 580v and 425r gratings from ralcon development laboratory , with improved efficiency , focus , and data uniformity .",
    "the wavelength coverage is 3900 ",
    "5600  and 5400  7500 and",
    "the grating and camera angles ( and hence dimensionless resolutions ) are identical .",
    "the peak system efficiency ( good conditions and acquisition , wavelengths near blaze , good fibres ) is 11% , but can be much less .",
    "the marginally lower dispersion of the 580v vph grating , as compared with the 600v reflection grating , is compensated by the better focus allowed by the reduced pupil relief .",
    "the uk schmidt with 6df is well - suited to low to medium resolution spectroscopy of bright ( @xmath22 ) , sparsely distributed sources ( 1 to 50  deg@xmath23 ) . as such",
    ", it fills the gap left open by 2df for large , shallow surveys covering a significant fraction of the total sky . in terms of @xmath24 ( telescope aperture @xmath20 field of view ) , ukst/6df is similar to aat/2df and sloan .",
    "surveys which cover the sky in a new waveband ( such as 2mass ) , are invariably shallow and wide - angle , as this maximises the return ( in terms of sample numbers ) , for the intrinsically difficult observations .",
    "this also holds true for the iras , rosat , hipass , nvss and sumss surveys .",
    "other projects , such as finding peculiar velocities , are even more strongly driven to being as shallow and wide - angled as possible ; and any project using galaxy distributions to predict dynamics requires just as great sky coverage as possible .",
    "all such surveys are hence uniquely matched to 6df , with its ability to map the whole sky in realistic timescales .",
    "these arguments have been extended and formalised by burkey & taylor ( 2004 ) , who have recently studied how the scientific returns of 6dfgs should be optimised in light of existing large - scale datasets such as the 2dfgrs and sdss .",
    "their analysis shows that the combined redshift ( @xmath15 ) and peculiar velocity ( @xmath25 ) components of the 6dfgs give it the power to disentangle the degeneracy between several key parameters of structure formation , listed in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "they demonstrate that @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be determined to within around 3% if only the redshift survey is used , although , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are much less well - constrained . if the combined @xmath15 and @xmath25 data are used , all of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 can be determined to within 2  3% . the change in @xmath28 and @xmath30 on different spatial scales",
    "can also be determined to within a few percent .",
    "clearly the advantage of the 6dfgs in understanding structure formation comes from its large - scale determination of galaxy masses , in addition to distances .",
    "burkey & taylor also calculate the optimal observing strategy for 6dfgs , and confirm that the dense sampling and widest possible areal coverage are indeed close to optimal for parameter estimation .",
    ".cosmological parameters readily measurable from the 6df galaxy survey .",
    "[ tab : params ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     access to the database is through two different hypertext mark - up language ( html ) entry forms .",
    "both parse the user input and submit an sql request to the database . for users unfamiliar with sql , the menu driven form provides guidance in constructing a query .",
    "the sql query box form allows users more comfortable with sql access to the full range of sql commands and syntax .",
    "both forms allow the user to select different types of output ( html , comma separated value ( csv ) or a tar save - set of fits files ) .",
    "there are online examples of different queries using either the menu or sql form at http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/6dfgs/examples.html .",
    "more information about the database is available directly from the 6dfgs database website .",
    "the 6df galaxy redshift survey ( 6dfgs ) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 150000  galaxies and the peculiar velocities of 15000 .",
    "the survey uses the 6df multi - fibre spectrograph on the united kingdom schmidt telescope , which is capable of observing up to 150 objects simultaneously over a @xmath3-diameter field of view .",
    "the 2mass extended source catalog ( jarrett  2000 ) is the primary source from which targets have been selected .",
    "the primary sample has been selected with @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the total @xmath33-band magnitude as derived from the isophotal 2mass @xmath33 photometry .",
    "additional galaxies have been selected to complete the target list down to @xmath34 .",
    "thirteen miscellaneous surveys complete the total target list .",
    "the survey covers the entire southern sky ( declination @xmath35 ) , save for the regions within @xmath36 of the galactic plane .",
    "this area is has been tiled with around 1500 fields that effectively cover the southern sky twice over .",
    "an adaptive tiling algorithm has been used to provide a uniform sampling rate of 94% . in total",
    "the survey covers some 17046deg@xmath4 and has a median depth of @xmath37=0.05 .",
    "there are three stages to the observations , which initially target the declination strip @xmath38 , followed by the equatorial region @xmath39 , and conclude around the pole , ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "spectra are obtained through separate v and r gratings and later spliced to produce combined spectra spanning 4000  8400 .",
    "the spectra have 5 ",
    "6  fwhm resolution in v and 9  12   resolution in r. software is used to estimate redshifts from both cross - correlation with template absorption - line spectra , and linear fits to the positions of strong emission lines .",
    "each of these automatic redshift estimates is checked visually and assigned a quality @xmath41 on a scale of 1 to 5 , where @xmath42 covers the range of reliable redshift measurements .",
    "the median signal - to - noise ratio is 9.4  for redshifts with quality @xmath43 , and 5.3  for @xmath44 redshifts .",
    "the data in this paper constitute the first data release of 52048observed spectra and the 46474  unique extragalactic redshifts from this set .",
