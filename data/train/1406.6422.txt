    "@xcite , if correct , would only apply to a proposal for dark energy based upon a nmc scalar field with no potential term : as such , it would only be useful in ruling out such a model  but not the existing proposal for a phase of accelerated expansion of the universe due to a nmc between curvature and baryonic matter @xcite , which is described by @xmath77 @xcite , its energy density , and requires no additional scalar field .",
    "given the above , it is clear that a correct treatment of cosmological perturbations of a nmc purely kinetic scalar field requires the inclusion of the dynamical contribution of the additional degree of freedom embodied in @xmath30 . indeed , considering the perturbed metric ds^2 = ( 1 + 2)dt^2 - ( 1 - 2 ) a^2(t ) _ ij dx^i dx^j  . and assuming small perturbations @xmath78 , @xmath79 yields , to first order in all perturbations , the field equation for @xmath62 @xcite , & & 0 = p_,x k^2 a^2 + p_,x _ 0 - 3 p_,x _ 0 + + & & ( p_,x + p_,xx _ 0 ^ 2 ) ( + 3 h - _ 0 ) + + & & [ ( 3 p_,xx + p_,xxx _ 0 ^ 2 ) _ 0 _ 0 + ( p_,x + p_,xx _ 0 ) _ 0 ^ 2 ] + + & & [ ( p_,x + p_,xx ^2_0 ) _ 0 + ( 3h p_,x + p_,x _ 0 ) _ 0 ] + & & + [ ( 3h p_,xx + p_,x _ 0 ) _ 0 ^ 3 - 2 ( 3h p_,x + p_,x _ 0 ) _ 0 - + & & ( 2 p_,x + 5 p_,xx _ 0 ^ 2 + p_,xxx _ 0 ^ 4 ) _ 0 ]  . if one simply takes the ratio between the second time derivative and the gradient terms , ensues . as shown below , inclusion of the additional degree of freedom @xmath30 yields different results , showing that the above computation ignores the effect of other terms ( such as the gravitational potentials @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , which are related to @xmath82 through the perturbed einstein equations .    the authors of this work do not know of any study of cosmological perturbations of a interacting two - field k - essence model , precisely due to the intricate nature of the ensuing equations of motion ( and its perturbations ) ; existing works on interacting @xcite , non -",
    "interacting @xcite and purely kinetic multifield k - essence models @xcite do show that the relevant criteria for model stability is that the speed of sound of curvature perturbations should be positive defined , and that the latter is related to the speed of sound of all the scalar fields considered .",

    "@xcite , one may instead defend that obtaining a faster - than - light propagation of perturbations for a particular matter species does not invalidate the underlying theory , but instead shows that the adopted matter content is unphysical ( in the context of the particular model under scrutiny ) .",

    "@xcite refer to the rather unnatural assumption of nmc k - essence and does not have any bearing on models for dark matter based on nmc baryonic matter .",
    "furthermore , this prohibition of a superluminal speed of sound is not as obvious as it may appear at first sight : indeed , lorentz invariant theories are allowed with @xmath91 , since the speed of sound can then act as a causality - imposing upper limit for the velocity  albeit at the cost of possibly ill - defined microscopic properties of matter , and with the caveat that @xmath92 is then fundamentally unbounded itself @xcite .    a more thorough analysis of the lorentzian signature of the spacetime manifold relies on global hyperbolicity as a sufficient requirement for causality .",

    "the conformal transformation used to arrive at the equivalent action relies on a conformal transformation from the jordan to the einstein frame , which implies that the lagrangian density of matter should be constructed with a physical metric @xmath95 related to @xmath30 : this enables a more complex dependency of the putative k - essence function @xmath96 on @xmath30 , which should not be dismissed .",
    "even if this interaction between the purely kinetic lagrangian density @xmath97 and the additional degree of freedom @xmath31 could somehow be disregarded , the effect of the canonical term of the latter leads to a speed of sound for curvature perturbations different from the single field k - essence form argued in @xcite  again highlighting the relevance of @xmath31 .",
    "finally , the use of the constraint @xmath98 is not completely clear or universally accepted , as the structure of spacetime in an evolving universe implies that the usual causality argument established in minkowski spacetime may no longer be valid .    given the above , we believe that the analysis of tamanini and koivisto @xcite is unfounded , as it presents an incorrect analogy with k - essence which , even if correct , would not apply to models in which there is only baryonic matter .",
    "we naturally concede that the interesting questions raised in that work prompt further investigation  namely how the analysis of the propagation of perturbations in nmc cosmological models can lead to further constraints on the model , and how an nmc is related to causality and the global structure of spacetime .",
