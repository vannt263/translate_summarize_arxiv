    ", world lines of free macroscopic particles are timelike straights , i.e. , characteristic geometrical structures of the pseudo - euclidean space .",
    "second , we have no homogeneous models of the space - time other than pseudo - euclidean space and the constant curvature space .",
    "but world lines of free microparticles ( electrons , positrons , etc . )",
    "are stochastic .",
    "they are not characteristic structures of the pseudo - euclidean space .",
    "a description of the microparticle motion needs use of the quantum mechanics principles .",
    "is it possible such an isotropic homogeneous model of the space - time , that its characteristic geometric structures ( analog of timelike straights ) would describe the motion of both macro- and microparticles ?",
    "if so , then the quantum features of the particle motion would be found in the spacetime model in itself , the quantum constant @xmath6 being one of the parameters of this model .",
    "such a model would be attractive , as far as it would not need a use of quantum principles .",
    "construction of such a model needs rather wide class of isotropic homogeneous space - time models , what , in turn , needs to be beyond of scope of the riemannian geometry .",
    "recently @xcite such a rather strong generalization of the riemannian geometry appeared .",
    "this generalization permits us to construct a rather wide class of isotropic homogeneous models and to realize the above program .",

    "definition of the @xmath0 space realizes the simple physical idea that the space - time properties are described completely by giving interval for every pair of points .",
    "it agrees entirely with the conventional definition of geometry ( for instance , riemannian geometry ) .",
    "but at the conventional approach the relations of type ( [ a1.1 ] ) are given on a manifold @xmath23 of a definite dimension ( not on an arbitrary set @xmath8 ) .",
    "on the manifold @xmath23 such concepts as continuity , curve , surface , and coordinate system are defined . in other words , at the conventional approach both affine relations realized in the concept of manifold and metric relations of type ( [ a1.1 ] ) are introduced together .",
    "they have to be agreed . only in this case",
    "the riemannian geometry arises .",

    "now it is used mainly in quantum gravitation @xcite . in all cases",
    "it was used as some derivative structure , i.e. , a manifold @xmath23 and a coordinate system @xmath24 on @xmath23 were defined first .",
    "then a metric tensor is determined in this coordinate system .",
    "thereafter , the world function is defined as a half of square of interval measured along geodesic .    in the @xmath0 space",
    "the affine properties introduced by means of a manifold happen to be derivatives of metric properties @xcite described by the world function . in particular , if @xmath0 space satisfies some conditions ( formulated in terms of @xmath0 function ) , then the @xmath0 space is a riemannian space .",
    "it means that the set @xmath8 is a manifold , and one can determine its dimension in terms of @xmath0 function , construct a coordinate system , geodesics , etc . for the riemannian space the tubes @xmath25 of @xmath21th order are @xmath21-dimensional geodesic surfaces .",
    "if the @xmath0 space does not satisfy these conditions , it is not a riemannian space . in this case",
