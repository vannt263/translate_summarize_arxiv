    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) are gas rich irregular galaxies and satellites of the milky way ( mw ) . given the proximity to the galaxy and their high galactic latitude , the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) are perfect laboratories for extragalactic studies , since the light emitted from them is not much attenuated by the dust present in the galactic disk .",
    "these objects are highly studied , motivated by the fact that , through understanding them , we can also better comprehend , for instance , galaxy evolution from high redshifts to now ; the structure of irregular dwarf galaxies ; the interstellar medium ( ism ) content at the external parts of huge spiral galaxies ; star formation at low metalicity environments ; dwarf galaxies in interaction ; and the relation of satellite galaxies with their hosts .",
    "the mcs are low metalicity galaxies  @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the lmc and smc , respectively @xcite .",
    "this peculiarity makes their ism particularly different from the one of our galaxy . among the major differences , we can point out the high gas - to - dust ratio @xcite and the submm excess emission @xcite .",
    "the smc consists of two main features : bar and wing .",
    "the bar component is the main body of the smc and corresponds to its northern part , which has a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath14 .",
    "the wind is located @xmath15 east of the bar and corresponds to its southern part @xcite .    the dynamical evolution of the smc  lmc ",
    "mw system seems to have generated two interesting structures  the magellanic stream and the magellanic bridge .",
    "these structures are well illustrated in the hi column density map ( figure 2 ) presented by @xcite .",
    "the magellanic stream is a gas tail covering over @xmath16 , also going through the galactic south pole .",
    "one scenario says that this gas might have been pulled out of the smc and lmc due to tidal interaction between the mcs and the mw @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "the magellanic bridge seems to have been generated due to the same effect , but between the smc and the lmc @xcite .",
    "more recently , high precision proper motions from the _ hubble space telescope _ showed that the mcs are moving @xmath17  km / s faster than earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "these high velocities favor a scenario where the mcs are in their first infall toward the mw @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", @xcite found that the magellanic stream may have been formed by lmc tides on the smc before the system was accreted by the mw .",
    "@xcite studied several orbits consistent with the recent proper motions .",
    "they assumed an orbital history where the mcs became a strongly interacting pair just recently . in this picture ,",
    "their first close encounter provided enough tidal forces to disrupt the smc s disk and create the magellanic stream .",
    "in contrast to the magellanic stream , the magellanic bridge has a young stellar population @xcite , besides being composed of gas and dust @xcite .",
    "the study of gas - to - dust ratio of the magellanic bridge confirms the hypothesis that the magellanic bridge is formed of material that was stripped from the smc @xcite .",
    "moreover it was found that at the magellanic bridge the gas - to - dust ratio is about @xmath18 times higher than in the galaxy and about two times higher than the value expected by its metalicity , indicating that some of the dust in that region must have been destroyed .",
    "it is not well known whether the mcs were formed as a binary system or were dynamically coupled about @xmath19  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "the kinematic history reconstruction of the mcs suggests that their last closest approach occurred about @xmath20  gyr ago , when they came within 27  kpc distance of each other , a likely progenitor event for the construction of the bridge .",
    "another possible result of this interaction is the stretching in northeastern and wing sections toward the lmc @xcite .",
    "the last interaction was also likely responsible for the bimodality of the smc along its depth @xcite , a feature that is corroborated by the velocity components in hi data , which are @xmath21  km s@xmath22 in difference @xcite .",
    "distances to cepheids show that the high velocity component is located further in distance , while the low velocity component is closer .",
    "both components appear to be expanding at around @xmath23  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "the low velocity component itself is further subdivided into two other groups , one extending from the center to the northeast ( ne ) at a location of @xmath24  kpc , the other , extending from the bar to the southwest ( sw ) at a location of @xmath25  kpc .",
    "the bar is the most extended region ( @xmath26@xmath27  kpc ) and therefore the hi profiles in that direction are very complex @xcite .",
    "the study of the hi component at the smc shows that it rotates @xcite , indicating that the smc contains a disk component .",
    "distances to cepheids also show that the two gas components are about @xmath28  kpc apart and have a depth of @xmath29  kpc . a double component , relating to the distances , is also observed in cepheids located in the bridge , consistent with the two gaseous components . besides the bridge s bifurcation",
    ", it is also , on average , closer to us than the smc @xcite .",
    "recently , red clump ( rc ) and rr lyrae stars ( rrls ) were used to estimate the smc s line of sight depth .",
    "@xcite used these stars to study the three - dimensional structure of smc and found that smc has an average depth of @xmath30  kpc .",
    "they concluded also that the ne region is closer to us and an elongation along the ne ",
    "sw direction is seen .",
    "@xcite used rc stars to study the eastern and western regions of smc and found that the first has a larger depth ( @xmath31  kpc ) , while the second has a much shallower depth ( @xmath10  kpc ) .",
    "some of their eastern fields showed a bimodality , with one component located at @xmath32  kpc and the other at @xmath33  kpc away from us , leading them to conclude that the closer stellar component was stripped from smc during the past interaction .",
    "the study of the stellar distribution of smc shows that it has a spheroidal or slightly ellipsoidal structure @xcite .",
    "a stellar disk structure is also observed ; however , there is a discrepancy between the gaseous and stellar disk parameters @xcite .",
    "the overall picture shows that smc possesses a stellar and a gaseous disk component , as well as a spheroidal stellar component .",
    "the eastern region and magellanic bridge are closer in distance to us and show a bimodal structure .",
    "these regions are also the ones that were probably most affected by the past interaction , which explains why they may be approaching lmc , which is located at @xmath34  kpc from us .",
    "the line of sight depth estimations show a relative high dispersion from region to region , with the eastern side being deeper than the western side .",
    "the magnetic field of smc was previously studied using several techniques  optical interstellar polarization , faraday rotation , and synchrotron emission .",
    "the interstellar polarization is caused by the alignment of the dust grains angular momentum with a local magnetic field .",
    "the unpolarized light emitted by the stars become polarized due to the dichroic extinction by dust grains . therefore ,",
    "optical polarization vectors trace the magnetic field projected in the plane of the sky , and a polarization map can be interpreted as a magnetic field map in that direction .",
    "the phenomenon known as faraday rotation happens , when radiation travels through an ionized medium with a local magnetic field . the light plane of polarization rotates , if the local magnetic field has a parallel component to the direction of propagation of the light .",
    "the incident light is decomposed in to two parts circularly polarized with opposite rotations .",
    "the synchrotron emission is produced when charged particles are accelerated by a magnetic field .",
    "the radiation emitted by these particles is polarized , because the acceleration is not isotropic .",
    "@xcite used optical polarization data from @xcite and obtained an ordered magnetic field projected in the plane of the sky of @xmath35 g and a turbulent component of @xmath36 g . @xcite",
    "analyzed optical polarization data from @xcite and estimated an ordered sky - projected magnetic field of @xmath37 g and a turbulent field of @xmath38 g .",
    "@xcite also estimated the line of sight ordered magnetic field , through faraday rotation , using data from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "they obtained @xmath39 g , with the field pointing away from us .",
    "in addition , there are several studies based on the radio continuum synchrotron emission @xcite . using synchrotron emission and assuming energy equipartition between the cosmic rays and magnetic fields , @xcite estimated the smc s total magnetic field to be about @xmath40 g .",
    "photoelectric polarization data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggested that smc has an ordered magnetic field aligned with the magellanic bridge .",
    "polarized synchrotron emission , despite its weak nature in the smc , also confirmed such an alignment @xcite .",
    "besides the alignment with the bridge , @xcite observed an alignment of the ordered magnetic field with the smc s bar .",
    "the magnetic field may have played an important role in shaping the bridge , since the interstellar magnetic field of galaxies can be strong enough to influence the dynamics of their gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , this work aims to study the structure of the magnetic field using ccd data , which is more precise than photoelectric .",
    "we concentrated our study on the ne and wing regions of the smc , since these regions may have been more affected by the last interaction with lmc .",
    "we also have some data of the magellanic bridge , from the part closer to the smc , a structure probably formed due the interaction of the smc  lmc system .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : data ] , we describe the observational data , the reduction process , and how we built the catalog .",
    "the estimates for the foreground polarization are presented in section [ sec : foreground ] .",
    "we analyze the polarization patterns for each field observed in section [ sec : ppatterns ] .",
    "the magnetic field geometry is discussed in section [ sec : bgeometry ] .",
    "the alignment of the ordered magnetic field with respect to the magellanic bridge is discussed in section [ sec : alignment ] .",
    "we estimate the magnetic field strength in section [ sec : bintensity ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize our results and the main conclusions .",
    "the observational data were taken at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) over the course of five nights in 1992 november 1317 , applying the optical polarization technique and using the @xmath41  m telescope .",
    "the instrumental setup consisted of a half - wave retarder plate followed by a calcite , @xmath42 filter , and the detector .",
    "this setup gives us , for each star , two images with orthogonal polarizations .",
    "at least two sets of images , taken with the half - wave retarder plate positioned at different angles , are necessary for each object / field , to obtain the linear stokes parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "some standard stars polarization were measured using 16 images ( see table [ tab : standards ] ) .",
    "further details about the instrumental technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "a tek1k-1 1k  x  1k ccd , with a plate scale of @xmath45/pixel , read noise of @xmath46  e@xmath47  rms , and gain of @xmath48  e@xmath47/adu was used .    during the observational run , bias and flat - field images",
    "were taken to correct instrumental noise .",
    "one non - polarized standard star was observed , in order to check whether there was any instrumental polarization or not . also , three polarized standard stars were observed , in order to get the conversion for the polarization angles ( @xmath49 ) into the equatorial system .",
    "twenty - eight fields of 8  x  8  arcmin size , situated at the ne and wing sections of the smc as well as the magellanic bridge , were observed .",
    "we decided to concentrate our data efforts on these regions for the reasons mentioned previously , relating to the last interaction with the lmc , about @xmath20  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "the date of the observation , number of positions the retarder plate was rotated , and integration time for the standard stars are presented in table [ tab : standards ] .",
    "the coordinates and date of the observation for the 28 fields are presented in table [ tab : fields ] . for the fields ,",
    "the half - wave retarder plate was rotated four times and the integration time was @xmath50  s per frame .",
    "figure [ fig : fields ] shows the positions of these fields .",
