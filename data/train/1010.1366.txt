    "<S> the value of the important triple - pomeron coupling is estimated by an unorthodox procedure using the known diffractive parton distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> the result is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the pomeron - nucleon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this is in excellent agreement with an independent determination , @xmath0 , previously obtained by analysing the available data in the triple - regge region with absorptive effects taken into account .    </S>",

    "<S> petersburg , 188300 , russia    ` soft ' @xmath6 interactions are known to have large absorptive corrections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , there is a significant contribution to the @xmath6 cross section from high mass diffractive dissociation of the proton @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both of these effects are driven by the size of the triple - pomeron coupling , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the existing determination of this important parameter is obtained by analysing data in the triple - regge region @xcite . here , to confirm the previous value </S>",
    "<S> , we use diffractive deep inelastic data to provide an alternative estimate of @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a1 ]    we begin by noting that , in regge theory , the interaction of two high - energy particles is described by pomeron exchange . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider high - energy @xmath6 ( and @xmath8 ) collisions . physically the pomeron is represented by a ladder - type diagram . </S>",
    "<S> cutting the ladder diagram yields a ` comb ' of secondary particles , which correspond to inelastic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the present monte carlo simulations are based on partons ; the analogous chains of partons are generated as a semi - hard parton - parton collision supplemented by initial parton showers . </S>",
    "<S> these parton showers reproduce the dglap evolution leading to the final active partons , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : a1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence the inelastic cross section , which in terms of regge theory corresponds to pomeron exchange , is of the form ^nd_pp  </S>",
    "<S> =  dp_t^2dx_1dx_2  g(x_1,p_t^2)g(x_2,p_t^2 )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : sig ]     cross section driven by pomeron exchange.,height=226 ]    this expression is written simply in terms of gluons , but a summation over all parton pairs is implied . formally , the integration over the transverse momenta , @xmath11 , of the outgoing partons of the so - called ` semi - hard ' process , is infrared divergent as @xmath12 . in the pythia-8.1 monte carlo @xcite this divergency </S>",
    "<S> is removed by replacing the @xmath13 propagator by @xmath14 , where p_min  =  p_0()^0.12 , [ eq : para ] with the normalization @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the values @xmath16 gev and the exponent 0.12 were tuned to describe the available _ inclusive _ data and correlations up to tevatron energies .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 cross sections , which are respectively denoted @xmath18 ( middle curve ) and @xmath19 ( lower curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the final hadronic system @xmath20 for the @xmath6 case and @xmath21 for the @xmath17 case . in this plot </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath22 , but @xmath19 is essentially independent of @xmath23 for @xmath24 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is compared with a completely independent prediction ( upper curve ) obtained from @xmath6 elastic ( and diffractive ) data @xcite.,height=302 ]    the resulting values of the cross section , @xmath18 , are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the true non - diffractive cross section , @xmath18 , is much smaller once account is taken of the absorptive effects described by the multi - pomeron diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a2 ] that the values of the one - pomeron cross section are in broad agreement with the values obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite based on the analysis of quite a different set of data , that is _ elastic </S>",
    "<S> _ @xmath6 ( and @xmath8 ) scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> note that the inelastic cross section obtained from this elastic @xmath6 analysis @xcite also included the contributions from single- and double - diffractive dissociation of the protons . </S>",
    "<S> these diffractive processes are absent in the non - diffractive events generated by pythia . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is not surprisingly that the lkmr @xcite cross section is a bit larger than that obtained using ( [ eq : sig ] ) .    in regge theory , </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to account for pomeron - pomeron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example is the so - called triple - pomeron diagram . </S>",
    "<S> it describes the process where the system of outgoing hadrons is separated from a beam proton by a large rapidity gap . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram is sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the corresponding cross section ( which we denote @xmath19 ) is driven by the value of the triple - pomeron vertex @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> usually the value of @xmath7 is determined by a global analysis of the data in the triple - regge region , where the outgoing beam proton carries away a large fraction of its initial momentum , that is @xmath25 is close to 1 .    . </S>",
    "<S> now @xmath26 is the fraction of the upper proton s ( pomeron s ) momentum carried by the active parton.,height=226 ]    it is possible , and desirable , to evaluate the important triple - pomeron coupling , @xmath7 , by a qualitatively different procedure based on the known diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dpdfs are determined by analyses @xcite of deep inelastic events with large rapidity gaps that were observed at hera . </S>",
    "<S> essentially this alternative procedure is to replace one of the inclusive pdfs in ( [ eq : sig ] ) , say @xmath27 , by the known dpdf , @xmath28 , or , to be precise @xmath29 , see below . in this way we can determine the value of the inelastic pomeron - proton cross section , which can be written in the form vertex . ] _ </S>",
    "<S> pp^sd  =  g_3pg_n  ( ) ^(0 ) , [ eq : s1 ] which can then be compared with the @xmath6 inelastic cross section _ </S>",
    "<S> pp^nd  =  g_n^2  ( ) ^(0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : s2 ] it is implicit that ( [ eq : s1 ] ) and ( [ eq : s2 ] ) refer to the one - pomeron exchange cross sections . the mass of the final hadron state is @xmath21 in the @xmath17 case and @xmath20 for the @xmath6 case . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dpdfs are not presented in terms of the parton distributions inside the pomeron , but already include the pomeron flux factor . that is </S>",
    "<S> , they already include the vertices and upper pomeron propagators in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a3 ] . therefore to obtain @xmath19 we have had to divide the result obtained from ( [ eq : sig ] ) ( with @xmath27 replaced by @xmath28 ) by the pomeron flux factor f_p(x_p )  =  ( x_p)^2(1-_p(0 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the @xmath30-slope of the pomeron - proton interaction , @xmath31 , and the pomeron trajectory , @xmath32 , were taken to be those of the dpdf analysis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while the pomeron - nucleon coupling , @xmath1 , is taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . strictly speaking the dpdfs </S>",
    "<S> depend on the value of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> however it is seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a4 ] that the value of @xmath19 is not strongly dependent on the value of @xmath23 in the kinematic range where diffractive deep inelastic data were measured at hera , that is , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact confirms the regge factorization approach which is used in the analysis of diffractive deep inelastic data .     on the value of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the three values chosen for @xmath23 span the region of the hera diffractive data.,height=302 ]    we note that the tuning of the pythia monte carlo , with the parameters given in ( [ eq : para ] ) , was obtained using a leading order ( lo ) framework , while the dpdfs were obtained using a nlo analysis . </S>",
    "<S> there is a large difference between the lo and nlo inclusive pdfs for the proton , which arises mainly from the absence of the @xmath33 singularity in the lo @xmath34 splitting function . </S>",
    "<S> in general , this difference is compensated by nlo corrections to the matrix elements , but since the only tuning of @xmath35 of ( [ eq : para ] ) was done within the lo framework we can not use nlo proton distributions .    in the diffractive case ( the dpdfs of the pomeron ) the gluons dominate the input distributions ; thus lo and nlo are reasonably close to each other . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the calculation of @xmath19 using the same lo cteq5l partons as in th @xmath6 case , and the nlo partons @xcite from the pomeron side , should not cause a problem . indeed , using dpdfs obtained at lo in the h1 b fit of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we obtain a rather similar result for @xmath19 , as indicated by the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the two results can be considered as a measure of the uncertainty in the determination of the ratio @xmath36 .     </S>",
    "<S> determined using dpdfs measured at hera as a function of the mass @xmath37 of the system resulting from proton dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo curves were obtained using the dpdfs of @xcite , whereas the lo curves result from the dpdfs of the h1 analysis @xcite.,height=302 ]    the ratio of the @xmath17 to the @xmath6 cross sections in the relevant mass range , @xmath38 gev are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : a5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the result is  =  0.2 . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is in remarkable agreement with the value 0.2 obtained from the analysis @xcite of pure soft _ triple - regge data _ , that is from a completely different set of data to the _ diffractive deep inelastic data _ used for the present estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of the ` diffractive ' cross section , @xmath39 , and of the ratio @xmath36 as @xmath37 decreases below 50 gev , is explained in regge theory by the admixture of secondary reggeons in the @xmath17-amplitude ( namely the @xmath40 contribution ) , which is hidden in the ` large ' @xmath9 behaviour of the diffractive pdfs . </S>"
