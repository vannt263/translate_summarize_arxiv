    "optical microcavities attract considerable attention due to the possibility to confine light with a well defined frequency  @xmath0 for a long time  @xmath1 to very small volumes  @xcite .",

    "one area of attention are coupled - resonator optical waveguides ( crows ) , which have been proposed independently by a number of groups  @xcite .",
    "such waveguides are formed by a serial chain of microcavities with high quality factors ( @xmath2 ) , which are weakly coupled by their evanescent fields .",
    "potential applications range from optical filtering  @xcite over optical buffering  @xcite and nonlinear components  @xcite to group velocity compensation  @xcite .",
    "crows have been fabricated in various different cavity geometries , for instance , photonic crystal defect cavities  @xcite , microspheres  @xcite , microrings  @xcite , racetrack microcavities  @xcite , and microdisks  @xcite .",

    "so far , the openness of the individual resonators has not been fully incorporated in the description .",

    "@xcite . on a more fundamental level , @xcite investigated the impact of the decay rate on the maximum delay time achievable in crows .",
    "however , the openness of a cavity not only expresses itself in a finite decay rate .",
    "another important feature known from quasi - bound states in quantum mechanics is the appearance of nonorthogonality of modes ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the nonorthogonality becomes extreme near so - called exceptional points ( eps ) in parameter space @xcite , at which two or more eigenvalues _ and _ eigenstates coalesce . as a matter of fact",
    ", significant nonorthogonality of nearly degenerate mode pairs appears already in slightly deformed or perturbed microdisk cavities which do not possess a mirror - reflection symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this interesting phenomenon has been traced back to _",
    "asymmetric backscattering _ of clockwise ( cw ) and counterclockwise ( ccw ) propagating traveling waves  @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this asymmetric backscattering is that both modes have a similar finite orbital angular momentum , meaning that both modes mainly copropagate in the same direction .",
    "this property is known as `` chirality '' , but should not to be confused with the optical activity in chiral media , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . near an ep",
    ", the above - mentioned chirality can be related to the intrinsic chirality defined in the space of the near - degenerate modes @xcite .",
    "chirality of modes has been confirmed recently in an experiment on a microdisk with two rayleigh scatterers on the perimeter  @xcite , while eps in complex band structures have been observed in numerical simulations of gain - loss modulated optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "however , up to now these nonorthogonality effects have been ignored in the modeling of crows .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a general description of wave propagation along crows in the presence of non - hermitian effects , which may arise both within each resonator as well as from the coupling between the resonators .",
    "first , we formulate a general theory of wave propagation in a crow tight - binding chain with a complex band structure and non - orthogonal modes .",
    "we show that these properties give rise to systematic corrections to the group velocity , which no longer coincides with the propagation velocity inferred from the probability flux .",
    "these corrections find a natural interpretation in a non - hermitian reformulation of the hellmann - feynman theorem .",
    "we then describe how the desired non - hermitian effects arise generically in an arrangement of a crow with asymmetric coupled microresonators , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] .",
    "such systems combine losses , asymmetric internal backscattering within each resonator , and asymmetric coupling between the resonators , and thus display eps both for the individual resonators as well as for the coupled chain .",
    "these findings are illustrated numerically for the specific implementation of a crow formed by microdisks that are perturbed by nanoparticles .",
    "we show that the non - hermitian effects combine quite naturally to induce eps in the complex band structure , which displays almost - real branches and complex branches .",

    "it is remarkable that the chirality is significant for almost all @xmath26 values . at the eps",

    "( [ eq : vgep ] ) the group velocity diverges at the ep as @xmath221 .",
    "this divergence naturally follows from the singular form of the dispersion relation at an ep and has been also observed numerically in honeycomb photonic lattices  @xcite .",

    "the interesting conclusion is that at the ep all cavities are effectively decoupled . nevertheless ,",

    "for the particular parameters chosen here , this wave packet is also found to propagate with @xmath62 .",
    "however , in the more general cases discussed below such wave packets split up due to the mixing and different losses in the various different bands , which in turn is enhanced due the non - orthogonality of the associated bloch wave functions .     in a system of size",

    "the bloch vector @xmath234 is @xmath26-independent , and the velocities @xmath235 coincide and remain finite . in the internally symmetric case ( middle column ) , the band structure is manifestly complex and displays eps . the velocities agree well in the regions where the chirality is small , and again drastically differ close to the eps .",
    "the situation is similar in the fully asymmetric complex case shown in the right column .",
    "we have derived explicit expressions for the group velocity and the intensity transport velocity of multi - mode wave packets in leaky coupled - resonator optical waveguides . from our analytical results",
    "it follows that these two velocities in general differ by a non - hermitian correction to the hellmann - feynman theorem .",

    "the perturbation breaks all symmetries and therefore introduces asymmetric internal backscattering , which turns out to be the most relevant source of non - hermiticity .",
    "numerical calculations of the tight - binding model show a complex band structure containing exceptional points where the bloch modes exhibit a complete chirality . in accordance with the theory , near the exceptional points the group velocity goes to infinity while the intensity transport goes to zero .",
    "the latter finding can be related to an effective decoupling of the resonators at the exceptional points .",
    "the results are verified with the help of numerical wave packet simulations .",
    "our general theory can be directly applied to other coupled - resonator optical waveguides , including to three - dimensional cases such as those made of microspheres .",
    "the case of the microsphere is interesting as it is a natural example where more than two modes are present in the unit cell and where higher - order exceptional points can be introduced .",
    "another class of systems where our theory can be applied is the field of pt - symmetric systems  @xcite .",
    "these are systems with a spectrum that turns from manifestly real to complex at exceptional points , which then are associated with a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking . in optical systems",
    "this situation can be realized via a balanced arrangement of absorbing and amplifying regions  @xcite .",
    "a straightforward application are coupled pt - symmetric dimer chains , which involve a two - mode unit cell  @xcite .",
    "looking further afield , non - hermitian effects occur in wave transport whenever losses are present .",
    "the physics of such systems can be further enriched by nonlinear effects , as they occur , for example , in chains of coupled quantum dot or quantum well exciton polaritons @xcite ."
