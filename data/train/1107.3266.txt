    "tang @xcite proved that some strongly singular integrals , pseudo - differential operators and their commutators are bounded on @xmath26 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in recent years , many papers are focused on criterions for boundedness of ( sub)linear operators on various hardy spaces with different underlying spaces ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and on entropy and approximation numbers of embeddings of function spaces with muckenhoupt weight ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also well known that the classical @xmath35 space ( the _ space of functions with bounded mean oscillation _ ) originally introduced by john and nirenberg @xcite and the classical morrey space originally introduced by morrey @xcite play an important role in the study of partial differential equations and harmonic analysis ; see , for example , @xcite .",

    "moreover , orlicz - hardy spaces are also suitable substitutes of the orlicz spaces in dealing with many problems of analysis ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "recall that orlicz - hardy spaces and their dual spaces were studied by janson @xcite on @xmath41 and viviani @xcite on spaces of homogeneous type in the sense of coifman and weiss @xcite .",
