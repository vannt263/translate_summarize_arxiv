    "the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( ) , launched 2001 june 30 , is a medium - class explorer ( midex ) mission designed to produce full sky maps of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",

    "scans the sky from near the second earth - sun lagrange point with a 129 s spin period and a 1 hour precession period @xcite .",
    "the resulting scan pattern is highly interconnected , minimizing systematic errors in the reconstructed maps .",
    "utilizes high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) based amplifiers @xcite with cooled input stages to reduce the noise of the radiometers .",
    "this paper describes the on - orbit performance of the radiometers with emphasis on those characteristics which determine the quality of the sky maps .",
    "design details and terminology used for the optics , radiometers and overall mission can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "detailed knowledge of the performance of the  optics and radiometers is essential in order to convert the raw time ordered data ( tod ) into accurate maps of the microwave sky .",
    "@xcite characterization of both the optics and radiometers employ a combination of pre - launch ground based measurements and on - orbit data .",
    "characterizations of the main beam and sidelobe response of the optics are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the key radiometer performance parameters are the frequency bandpasses , data collection system responses , and radiometer noise and gain characteristics .",
    "the frequency bandpasses and data collection system were fully characterized in pre - launch ground tests and are described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : data_col ] summarizes the audio frequency response of the data collection system together with the frequency roll - offs associated with the beam sizes and the angular spectrum of a typical cmb signal . the radiometer gain and noise properties",
    "were also characterized during ground tests , but the final precise measurement of these quantities is done while on orbit since they depend on details of the thermal environment of the radiometers which could not be predicted precisely before launch .",
    "approximately 2 hours after launch , power was applied to the  radiometers while the focal plane assembly ( fpa ) components were at approximately 265 k ; all 20 radiometers were observed to be operational .",
    "( the fpa comprises the input stages of the radiometers and feed horns and is designed to passively cool to @xmath0 k. ) over the next 2 days all the major radiometer assemblies , the fpa , the receiver box ( rxb ) , the analog electronics unit ( aeu ) and the power distribution unit ( pdu ) quickly approached nominal operating temperatures and radiometer performance improved as expected .",
    "( see figure 7 of @xcite for an block diagram containing details of these units . )",
    "infrared irradiation from the earth and moon during the first month of the mission , the trajectory phasing loops , induced thermal fluctuations in the instrument components , limiting the utility of radiometer performance analyses which could be performed . during this period ,",
    "however , valuable measurements of beam sidelobe pattern were obtained .",
    "these large thermal perturbations ended after the lunar encounter on 2001 july 30 , allowing the temperatures of the instrument components to approach their final steady state values .",

    "each thermometer is read out every 23 seconds , has @xmath1 resolution , @xmath2  k accuracy , and @xmath3 least significant bit of readout noise to allow averaging of multiple samples .",

    "the total variation also contains a slow annual term arising from the ellipticity of the earth s orbit modulating the level of insolation on the spacecraft plus a contribution from the initial thermal transient associated with phasing loops and the final lunar encounter .",
    "details of the thermal history of each component are presented in @xcite .",
    "future total variations are predicted to be @xmath4 the values given in the table since the transient effects will not be repeated .",
    "the spin synchronous term was measured by removing a slowly varying baseline from the temperature data and binning the residual temperature fluctuations synchronously with the spacecraft spin relative to the sun direction .",
    "keeping the spin synchronous temperature fluctuations at or below the design requirement values is essential in order to meet the systematic error requirements  @xcite .",
    "the measured spin synchronous temperature variations of all the instrument components are at least a factor of _ 50 smaller _ than the maximum allowed values specified in the systematic error budget , the values of which are also presented in table  [ table : thermal_perf ] .",

    "direct comparison of these values of @xmath75 is complicated by the fact that the data contained in figure  [ fig : f_knee ] comes from 20 different radiometers fabricated from hemt devices with three different geometries , while the @xcite results were obtained from measurements on a single amplification chain .",
    "the difference between the measured values of @xmath75 may therefore not be significant .",
    "the source of the high value of @xmath66 in the w41 and w42 radiometers is the large @xmath78 for these radiometers .",

    "the fact that the radiometer @xmath66 values track the measured values of @xmath78 , as shown in figure  [ fig : f_knee ] , indicates the radiometers are operating as expected .",
    "the exact source of the larger @xmath78 values is not known .        even with the relatively low values of @xmath66 for the majority of the radiometers , noise correlations are not negligible .",
    "maps produced directly from radiometer data for radiometers with @xmath79 exhibited small but detectable pixel noise correlations ( `` stripes '' ) which could corrupt power spectrum determinations . in order to minimize these effects in the final sky maps , a pre - whitening procedure has been adopted which fits a baseline to the tod after removal of an estimated sky signal obtained from the sky maps .",
    "details of the pre - whitening process are presented in @xcite .",
    "the last column in table  [ table : final_perf ] presents limits to spin synchronous artifacts in the tod for each of the radiometers .",
    "these values were determined by multiplying the limits on the spin synchronous temperature fluctuations of each radiometer section ( aeu , pdu , fpa and rxb ) by the appropriate susceptibility coefficient determined during ground testing , and summing values in quadrature .",
    "@xcite obtain similar results using susceptibility coefficients derived from on - orbit data . in all cases",
    "the limits on spin synchronous artifacts are much smaller than the @xmath80 allocated to the radiometers and data collection system in the systematic error budget @xcite .",
    "it is possible to obtain an estimate of spin synchronous artifacts directly from the tod independent of any model of its source .",
    "this was accomplished by binning 40 days of tod ( after removal of the cmb dipole signal ) in an azimuthal coordinate about the spin axis of the spacecraft .",
    "( recall the sun s elevation is fixed during observations by the  scan pattern . )",
    "each tod point was binned according to the sun s location at the time of the observation , and bin averages calculated .",
    "tod from all of the v and w band radiometers was used and a @xmath81 galactic cut applied .",
    "the limit obtained by this technique is @xmath82 rms , well below the @xmath83 value allowed in the systematic error budget  @xcite .",
    "note that this limit includes any artifacts which originate in the radiometers , data collection system or optical system .",
    "since both the estimated and measured systematic error limits are so small , _ no corrections arising from spin synchronous radiometric artifacts are applied to the tod in the production of the one year sky maps .",
    "_    during the data period incorporated in the 1 year maps a total of 21 sudden jumps ( `` glitches '' ) have occurred in the outputs of the radiometers .",
    "jumps were exhibited by the ka11 , ka12 , q11 , q12 and w12 radiometers .",
    "of these events , 19 involved single radiometers , one simultaneously affected two radiometers and one affected three .",
    "similar artifacts were observed during ground testing and have been identified as small parameter shifts in the properties of several microwave components resulting from sudden releases of internal mechanical stresses .",
    "the most common events involve the phase switches and filters , which are constructed with suspended stripline elements , but events have also been observed involving waveguide components connecting the orthomode transducers to the inputs of the radiometers .",
    "these events result in a negligible change in radiometer performance , but must be identified and excised from the tod in production of the maps .",
    "although the duration of each event is short , @xmath84  s , the data processing pipeline  @xcite requires removal of several hours of data surrounding each event resulting in a data loss of @xmath85 .",
    "a complete tabulation of these events can be found in @xcite .",
    "ideally the output of each  radiometer would exhibit a purely differential response to sky signals , rejecting any common mode component .",
    "this is not true if the power transmission coefficients , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , of the optics and waveguide components , which couple the sky signals from the a and b side beams to the radiometer , are not equal . in this case",
    "the output of a radiometer , @xmath88 , when the beams observe regions of sky with antenna temperatures @xmath89 and @xmath90 will be @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the gain of the radiometer .    using the cmb dipole signal it is possible to measure the common mode response of a radiometer to sky signals and",
    "therefore infer the value of @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dipole_template ] shows the pure predicted differential and common mode cmb dipole signals , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , for a typical 2 hour period of  observations .",
    "note that @xmath96 and @xmath97 are very nearly orthogonal when averaged over a precession period due to the symmetry of s scan pattern .",
    "@xcite the common mode signal is comprised of three terms .",
    "the first appears as the @xmath98 offset in the figure and is modulated on the one year timescale as s precession axis changes orientation with respect to the cmb dipole axis .",
    "this signal component is at such a low frequency and amplitude that it can not be distinguished from long term drifts in the radiometer offsets .",
    "the other two terms vary on the timescale of the precession ( 1 h ) and the spin ( 129 s ) , with most of the power being in the lower frequency component .",
    "the amplitude of these two signals combined is @xmath99 , so a 1% common mode response corresponds to a signal amplitude of @xmath100 .",
    "the common mode radiometric response was measured by fitting the raw radiometer tod to a function of the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the time of the observations , @xmath103 are polynomial coefficients used to remove a baseline , @xmath97 and @xmath96 are the common mode and differential cmb dipole signal templates and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the coefficients to be fit .",
    "raw data must be used since the calibration and baseline fitting procedures @xcite remove most of the very low frequency ( @xmath106 ) signal we are attempting to measure . the measured values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 are related to the transmission coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 by @xmath109 the tod is divided into segments containing an integral number of precession periods , @xmath110 , and a function of the form given by equation  [ eqn : fit_func ] fit to each segment .",
    "observations at galactic latitude @xmath111 are excluded from the fits .",
    "values of the fractional transmission imbalance , @xmath112 , defined as @xmath113 are presented in table  [ table : diff_trans ] .",
    "the braces indicate a weighted average of the measured coefficients , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , over the 232 day period used in the analysis .",
    "the results of the fits are insensitive to the values of @xmath110 chosen in the range of 4 - 10 , indicating that the baseline removal polynomial is not removing a significant amount of common mode signal .",
    "the fit values are also insensitive to the value of @xmath114 used provided @xmath115 , indicating that galactic signals are not biasing the results .",

    "the intrinsic radiometer noise is expected to exhibit a gaussian distribution .",
    "a plot of the v12 radiometer noise distribution obtained from 10 days of data is presented in figure  [ fig : noise_dist ] .",
    "this data period was chosen to be free of disturbances ( such as orbital station keeping maneuvers ) and its duration short enough so that the slow variations in system noise , driven by the annual temperature variation of the fpa , could be ignored .",
    "the noise signal was obtained by removing the cmb dipole and an estimated sky signal ( obtained from the final maps ) from the pre - whitened tod .",
    "data when either of the beams was in a region of high galactic emission ( as determined by the kp4 mask @xcite ) or near a planet were cut .",
    "no other cuts were made .",
    "the distributions for all 20 radiometers exhibited similar behavior , following gaussian distributions over at least 5 decades .",
    "no statistically significant skewness or kurtosis is observed in the noise distributions of any of the radiometers .",
    "given the gaussian noise distribution , the noise variance in a given pixel of the final sky maps should scale inversely with the number of observations of each pixel , @xmath123 .",
    "this is tested by measuring the variance of each set of map pixels with a given value of @xmath123 and plotting it against @xmath124 , as in figure  [ fig : noise_int ] .",
    "pixels with large galactic signals and point sources have been excluded based on the kp4 mask .",
    "( the values of @xmath123 have been corrected to account for small variations in the radiometer noise levels resulting from changes in the radiometers physical temperatures .",
    "values of @xmath123 are therefore not integers , but are scaled to correspond to a mean noise value . )",
    "since the cmb fluctuations are uncorrelated with the instrument noise , they add a constant variance to each bin .",
    "the slope of the line fit to the data is a measure of the noise per observation , while the y - intercept is the variance arising from the cmb fluctuations .",
    "the noise variance clearly scales as predicted , indicating that @xmath124 is a good predictor of the pixel noise .",
    "the primary gain calibration of  is derived from observations of the cmb dipole .",
    "although quite stable , small changes in the radiometer thermal environment produce measurable changes in the radiometer gains . gain measurements with errors of @xmath125 are obtained from each hour of observations . a gain model , relating instrument housekeeping data to the observed radiometric gain , has been developed to aid in smoothing and interpolating the hourly gain measurements .",
    "this model also reduces the uncertainty in gain determination when the dipole derived gain measurements degrade as a result adverse alignment of the scan pattern with the dipole orientation or the galactic plane .    following the notation of  @xcite , the modulated microwave power incident on a detector , @xmath126 , arising from an antenna temperature difference , @xmath127 ,",
    "may be written as @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the voltage gains of the two amplification chains in the radiometer and @xmath131 is a term that accounts for phase mismatches in the radiometer .",
    "the output voltage from the detector with input power @xmath126 is described by a response function @xmath132 .",
    "( this treatment differs from that given in  @xcite in that the response of the detector to the input power is described by a non - linear response function , @xmath132 , to allow for deviations from square law response and gain compression which can occur in the warm hemt amplifiers . ) for the small ( @xmath133 ) changes in detector input power it suffices to linearize this response about the nominal operating point , @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the differential responsivity of the detector and @xmath136 is a parameter to be fit . the _ modulated _ voltage output from the detector is then @xmath137 the dc ( unmodulated ) power out of the same detector , @xmath138 , is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the instantaneous noise voltages added by the hemt amplifiers and the overbar indicates an average on time scales long compared to the period of the microwave signal . the idea is to use the values of @xmath138 , measured to @xmath142 every 23.6 s , to estimate the value of @xmath143 , which , according to equation  [ eqn : mod_resp ] , determines the signal gain of the radiometer .",
    "using the approximation @xmath144 equation  [ eqn : bias_1 ] can be rewritten as @xmath145 provided that @xmath146 the term @xmath147 corresponds to the average system noise temperature , which is dominated by the input voltage noise of the cryogenic hemt amplifiers and as such is a slowly varying function of the physical temperature of the hemt amplifiers , @xmath117 .",
    "again , since the fractional temperature variations are small , it suffices to describe small changes in noise temperature using the relation @xmath148 combining equations  [ eqn : mod_resp ] , [ eqn : det_resp ] , and [ eqn : noise_dep ] yields @xmath149 using measured values of the radiometer response , @xmath88 , @xmath117 , and @xmath138 , and the known differential dipole signal , @xmath150 , it is possible to determine the parameters @xmath136 , @xmath151 and @xmath75 .",
    "once these parameters are determined the radiometer gain can be estimated using the measured values of @xmath117 and @xmath138 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gain_model ] shows the gain measured daily using the cmb dipole , and the result from fitting the gain model for the v11 radiometer .",
    "the model clearly tracks the dipole derived gain measurements well , and has substantially less scatter .",
    "values of the gain model parameters for all the detectors are presented in @xcite .    since the gain model depends only on the measured rf bias and temperature of the fpa amplifiers , the fact that it fits the measured dipole gains well over such a long period ( 1 year for this data set ) indicates that radiometer characteristics are stable .",
    "had some secular degradation occurred , for example a slowly increasing amplifier noise temperature or phase mismatch , constant values of the fit parameters , @xmath75 , @xmath151 and @xmath136 would not provide a good fit to the measured values for the entire time period .",
    "based on the accuracy of the fits there is no significant degradation in performance of any of the radiometer channels at the 1% level .",
    "all 20 differential radiometers aboard the  satellite are functional with close to nominal performance . on - orbit values of the radiometer offset temperatures are slightly higher than expected , leading to higher than expected @xmath152 knee frequencies in two of the radiometers .",
    "spin synchronous systematic errors from the radiometers and data collections system are expected to be @xmath153  for all radiometers , and the radiometer noise distributions for all channels are well described by gaussians .",
    "a gain model based on instrument housekeeping data has been developed to aid in interpolating and smoothing the hourly gain calibrations derived from the cmb dipole signal .",
