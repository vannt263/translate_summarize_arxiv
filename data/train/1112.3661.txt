    "particle magnetic moments provide an important and valuable test of qed and of the standard model ( sm ) . in the case of the muon and the electron magnetic moments , both the experimental measurements and the sm predictions",
    "are very precisely known . however , due to its larger mass , the muon magnetic moment is considered more sensitive to massive virtual particles and hence to new physics ( np ) .    in the sm",
    ", the total contributions to the muon @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) can be divided into three parts : the qed , the electroweak ( ew ) and the hadronic contributions . while the qed @xcite and ew @xcite contributions are well understood , the main theoretical uncertainties lies with the hadronic part which are difficult to control @xcite .",
    "the hadronic loop contributions can not be calculated from first principles , so that one relies on a dispersion relation approach @xcite . at present",
    "the available @xmath6 data are used to calculate the leading - order ( lo ) and higher - order vacuum polarization contributions to @xmath5 ; the estimated contributions are given by @xcite a^had_lo = 6955 ( 40)(7)10 ^ -11 , a^had , disp_nlo = -98 ( 1)10 ^ -11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the hadronic light - by - light contribution can not be calculated from data , hence , its evaluation relies on specific models .",
    "the latest determination of this term is @xcite a^had_lbl = 116(39)10 ^ -11 . including all these corrections , the complete sm prediction is given by a_^sm = 116591834(2)(41)(26)10 ^ -11 [ amusm ]  , whereas the current experimentally measured value is @xcite a_^exp = 116592089(54)(33)10 ^ -11 [ amuexp ]  .",
    "the sm prediction , therefore , differs from the the experimentally measured value by ( see also @xcite ) @xmath7 which allows some room for new physics . for the purpose of this work we are going to assume that the @xmath8 discrepancy in eq .",
    "[ amm ] is due to np , although we are aware that the estimates of the hadronic contributions have appreciable uncertainties that may provide part of the discrepancy .    in most extensions of the sm , new charged or neutral states@xmath9}$ ] , can contribute to the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath10amm ) at the one - loop ( lowest ) level .",
    "for example , the @xmath10amm plays an important role in constraining the supersymmetric ( susy ) parameter space , where , as in the sm , the leading susy contribution to @xmath11 arises at one - loop , and is found to be enhanced for large @xmath12 . in particular , as was shown in @xcite , susy can address the observed muon @xmath4 discrepancy for @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( higgsino mass parameter ) , with typical susy masses , of the particles involved in the loops , in the range @xmath15 .",
    "model independent analysis show that ( for details see @xcite ) , for small enough couplings , scalar exchange diagrams could account for the observed @xmath10amm with a scalar mass in the range @xmath16 , whereas pseudoscalar and axial - vector one - loop exchanges contribute with the wrong sign and the one - loop vector exchange contributions are too small .    in this paper we will consider the @xmath10amm in a new 2hdm framework with a heavy 4th generation family .",
    "indeed , we will show that the @xmath17 access ( with respect to the sm prediction ) shown in eq .",
    "[ amm ] can be explained by one - loop exchanges of the heavy 4th generation neutrino ( @xmath18 ) in a model with two higgs doublets that we have constructed in @xcite and named the 4g2hdm .",
    "these new class of two higgs doublet models were proposed in @xcite as viable low energy effective frameworks for models of 4th generation condensation . in particular ,",
    "a theory with new heavy fermionic states is inevitably cutoff at the near by tev - scale , where one thus expects some form of strong dynamics and/or compositeness to occur .",
    "thus , as was noted already 20 years ago @xcite , the low - energy ( i.e. , sub - tev ) dynamics of such a scenario may be more naturally embedded in multi - higgs theories , where the new composite scalars are viewed as manifestations of the several possible bound states of the fundamental heavy fermions . besides , our 4g2hdm can naturally ( albeit effectively ) accommodate the large ( ew - scale ) mass of the heavy 4th generation neutrino , which otherwise remains a cause of concern in theories with a 4th family of fermions .",
    "we recall that an additional fourth generation of fermions can not be ruled out by any symmetry argument , and is not excluded by ew precision data @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note , that already the simplest 4th generation extension of the sm , the so called sm4 , has the potential to address some of the current open questions in particle physics , such as the observed baryon asymmetry @xcite , the higgs naturalness problem @xcite , the fermion mass hierarchy problem @xcite etc .... @xmath19}$ ] the sm4 can also accommodate the emerging possible hints for new flavor physics @xcite .",
    "however , the sm4 as such can not explain the observed muon g-2 discrepancy , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in fact , even  standard \" 2hdm frameworks ( like the type ii 2hdm that underlies the minimal susy model ) with an additional 4th generation of heavy fermions , was shown to fail in explaining the measured @xmath10amm @xcite .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we calculate the @xmath10amm in the 4g2hdm framework . in sections",
