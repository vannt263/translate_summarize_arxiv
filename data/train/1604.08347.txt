    "dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions  @xcite ( dmi ) may occur in magnetic systems that lack some type of inversion symmetry .",
    "the inversion asymmetry can be present in the magnetic system either because of a non - centrosymmetric crystal lattice  @xcite ( helimagnetic material ) or due to the interfaces between different materials which inherently lack inversion symmetry .",
    "@xcite consequently , the dmi can be classified either as bulk or interfacial .",
    "the dmi favours magnetic moments at neighbouring lattice sites to be perpendicular to each other ( in plane that is perpendicular to the dzyaloshinskii vector ) , which is in contrast to the symmetric ferromagnetic exchange interaction which tends to align them parallel . when acting together , these two interactions mutually compete and find a compromise in the twist between two neighbouring magnetic moments , which allows a rich variety of different magnetisation textures .",
    "one of them is a skyrmion configuration with very promising properties  @xcite for the development of future high - density , power - efficient storage  @xcite and logic  @xcite devices .",
    "after it was predicted  @xcite that magnetic skyrmions can emerge in the presence of dmi , skyrmions were observed in magnetic systems with both bulk  @xcite and interfacial  @xcite types of dmi .",
    "however , all studies of helimagnetic ( bulk dmi ) materials required an external magnetic field to be applied in order to stabilise skyrmions .",
    "recently , a systematic micromagnetic study  @xcite reported all equilibrium states that can emerge in confined helimagnetic nanostructures and identified the lowest energy ( ground ) states .",
    "in particular , this study reported that in confined helimagnetic nanostructures two different skyrmionic states can emerge as the ground state in absence of both external magnetic field and magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "one state does not contain a complete spin rotation , whereas the other state contains one full spin rotation along the disk sample diameter , plus an additional magnetisation tilting at the boundary due to the specific boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite we refer to these configurations as incomplete skyrmion ( isk ) and isolated skyrmion ( sk ) states , respectively .",
    "@xcite in addition , the same study showed that the higher - order target ( t ) state with two complete spin rotations along the disk sample diameter can emerge as a metastable state at zero external magnetic field .",
    "understanding the dynamic response of skyrmionic states in confined helimagnetic nanostructures is of importance both from the aspect of fundamental physics as well as for their manipulation . in this work ,",
    "we explore the dynamics of all three equilibrium skyrmionic states using a full three - dimensional model which includes the demagnetisation energy contribution and does not assume the translational invariance of magnetisation in the out - of - film direction .",
    "a similar dynamics simulation study was performed for the isolated skyrmion breathing eigenmodes  @xcite in confined two - dimensional samples with interfacial dmi ; and high - frequency skyrmion spin excitations were analytically studied in thin cylindrical dots .",
    "@xcite the low - frequency ( two lateral and one breathing ) eigenmodes were reported in two - dimensional simulations of a hexagonal skyrmion lattice ,  @xcite where the demagnetisation energy was neglected .",
    "later , microwave absorption measurements explored the low frequency eigenmodes in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 ,  @xcite fe@xmath2co@xmath3si ,  @xcite and mnsi  @xcite helimagnetic bulk samples . in the case of a magnetic bubble  @xcite",
    "( magnetisation state stabilised due to the strong uniaxial anisotropy in the absence of dmi ) analytic ,  @xcite simulation ,  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies reported the existence of two low frequency gyrotropic eigenmodes , suggesting that the skyrmion possesses mass .",
    "in contrast , a recent analytic work  @xcite suggests that only one gyrotropic eigenmode exists in the confined dmi - induced skyrmion state , whereas another low - frequency lateral eigenmode is interpreted as an azimuthal spin - wave mode  @xcite .    using our full three - dimensional model , employing the eigenvalue  @xcite method , we compute all existing ( both lateral and breathing ) eigenmodes below @xmath4 in three different skyrmionic states .",
    "in addition , using the ringdown  @xcite method , we determine which eigenmodes can be excited using two different experimentally feasible excitations ( in - plane and out - of - plane ) .",
    "in contrast to the magnetic bubble , in the confined dmi stabilised skyrmionic states we find the existence of only one low frequency gyrotropic eigenmode .",
    "we also demonstrate the nonlinear dependence of eigenmode frequencies on the external magnetic bias field and the disk sample diameter , and show that the gyrotropic eigenmode might be the reversal mode of skyrmionic states .",
    "after we identify all eigenmodes of incomplete skyrmion ( isk ) and isolated skyrmion ( sk ) ground states , we compare their power spectral densities ( psds ) in the same sample at different external magnetic field values .",
    "we discuss the comparisons and observe several key differences that can contribute to the experimental identification of the state present in the studied sample .",
    "although we base this study on the specific helimagnetic material fege , in order to make this study relevant to any helimagnetic material , we need to determine as many resonant frequencies as possible that can be detected using a specific excitation . because of that , we need to reduce the linewidth and allow sufficient separation between peaks in the power spectral density ( computed using the ringdown method ) .",
    "consequently , in the first part of this work , we use the gilbert damping  @xcite @xmath5 .",
    "after we identify all resonance frequencies and corresponding eigenmodes using @xmath6 , we experimentally measure the real value of fege gilbert damping and use it to determine which ( out of all previously identified eigenmodes ) can be experimentally detected in the fege sample .",
    "finally , we investigate how the demagnetisation energy contribution and magnetisation variation in the out - of - film direction affect the dynamics of skyrmionic states .",
    "we report that although the eigenmode magnetisation dynamics is not significantly affected , the resonance frequencies change substantially , which indicates that ignoring the demagnetisation energy or modelling the thin film helimagnetic samples using two - dimensional meshes is not always justified .",

    "<S> in confined helimagnetic nanostructures , skyrmionic states in the form of incomplete and isolated skyrmion states can emerge as the ground state in absence of both external magnetic field and magnetocrystalline anisotropy . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamic properties ( resonance frequencies and corresponding eigenmodes ) of skyrmionic states in thin film fege disk samples . </S>",
    "<S> we employ two different methods in finite - element based micromagnetic simulation : eigenvalue and ringdown method . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalue method allows us to identify all resonance frequencies and corresponding eigenmodes that can exist in the simulated system . </S>",
    "<S> however , using a particular experimentally feasible excitation can excite only a limited set of eigenmodes . because of that , we perform ringdown simulations that resemble the experimental setup using both in - plane and out - of - plane excitations . in addition , we report the nonlinear dependence of resonance frequencies on the external magnetic bias field and disk sample diameter and discuss the possible reversal mode of skyrmionic states . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the power spectral densities of incomplete skyrmion and isolated skyrmion states and observe several key differences that can contribute to the experimental identification of the state present in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the fege gilbert damping , and using its value we determine what eigenmodes can be expected to be observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that neglecting the demagnetisation energy contribution or ignoring the magnetisation variation in the out - of - film direction  although not changing the eigenmode s magnetisation dynamics significantly  changes their resonance frequencies substantially . apart from contributing to the understanding of skyrmionic states physics </S>",
    "<S> , this systematic work can be used as a guide for the experimental identification of skyrmionic states in confined helimagnetic nanostructures . </S>"
