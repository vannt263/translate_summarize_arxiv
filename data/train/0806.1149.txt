    "theoretical modeling of ion channeling through carbon nanotubes has reached a mature level @xcite whereas experimental realization of this process is still at the preliminary stage @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , theoreticians continue to explore possible applications of ion channeling through the nanotubes , beginning with those based on the _ angular _ distributions of channeled ions , e.g. , for the purpose of deflecting ion beams in accelerators @xcite or determining some structural details of the short nanotubes using the rainbow effect @xcite .",
    "besides , theoretical studies of the _ spatial _ distributions of channeled ions have demonstrated the possibility of creating nanosized ion beams , which could find interesting applications in biomedical research and for materials modification @xcite .",
    "however , an additional application of ion channeling through the nanotubes based on the _ spatial _ distributions remains to be investigated in the context of extending the classical use of ion channeling for materials analysis @xcite to the nanotube based materials .",
    "namely , one of the most powerful applications of ion channeling through single crystals was developed to detect and locate their defects .",
    "it is based on measuring ion dechanneling on such defects in combination with their rutherford backscattering @xcite .",
    "it was crucial for this application of ion channeling to develop the adequate theoretical models for calculating the spatial distributions of channeled ions , and thus enable the precise control and interpretation of the measurements , providing the information on such defects @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the nanotubes can exhibit numerous defects , appearing during their synthesis or due to external agents such as particle irradiation @xcite .",
    "moreover , one of the main directions within the nanotube research is related to the phenomena of intercalation of the atomic and molecular species in them @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to explore whether ion channeling can be also used to analyze defects in the nanotubes , in particular , to detect and locate the atoms and molecules intercalated in them . in a first attempt to address this problem",
    ", we present here a detailed study of the spatial distributions of protons channeled through the nanotubes , with special emphasis on the rainbow effect in the transverse plane with its possible applications .    having in mind that the ion channeling regime is most suitable for probing the atoms intercalated in the nanotubes involves light ions in the mev energy range @xcite",
    ", one must emphasize that , for such projectiles , the dynamic polarization of the nanotube atoms valence electrons can give rise to the strong image force , which can pull the channeled ions towards the nanotube wall @xcite .",
    "of course , one expects that the intercalated atoms would be placed right there , close to the nanotube wall , in some state of adsorption on the nanotube atoms surface .",
    "while the image force has not been found to play any significant role in channels of single crystals @xcite , its role has been identified clearly in ion - surface scattering @xcite , and in ion transmission through capillaries in solids @xcite .",
    "in addition , although the image force plays the minor roles in ion channeling through the nanotubes in the gev and kev energy ranges @xcite , it has been shown to influence strongly ion trajectories in the mev energy range .",
    "for example , the image force gives rise to the rainbow effect in angular distributions of protons channeled through the short chiral single - wall and double wall nanotubes @xcite .",
    "it has been established that , when the nanotubes are grown in a dielectric medium , one can achieve a very high degree of their ordering and straightening .",
    "this makes such composite structures very suitable candidates to be used in experiments of ion channeling through the nanotubes .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the effects of the surrounding dielectric medium on ion channeling through the nanotubes in the mev energy range .",
    "the materials of interest are al@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , sio@xmath1 @xcite as well as ni @xcite and pt @xcite . in this context",
    ", it has been shown recently that the image force and , consequently , the rainbow effect in the angular distributions of protons channeled through the nanotubes can be strongly modified by the polarization of the surrounding cylindrical dielectric boundary @xcite . the separation between the nanotube and the sio@xmath1 and al@xmath1o@xmath2 boundaries",
    "is approximated by the nanotube atom van der waals radius @xcite .",
    "the separation between the nanotube and the ni boundary is approximated by the separation between the a graphene and a ( 111 ) ni surface , which was calculated using a minimization structural calculation based on the density functional theory @xcite . in both cases",
    "the obtained separation was 3.21 a.u .",
    "we shall investigate here how the spatial distributions of protons channeled in the ( 11 , 9 ) single - wall nanotubes placed in vacuum or embedded in various dielectric media are affected by the dynamic polarization effect . while such a study complements our previous studies of the influence of the image force on the rainbow effect in the angular distributions of protons channeled in the nanotubes @xcite , we expect that the analogous influence on the spatial distribution of channeled protons may lead to a significant change of the proton flux within the nanotube , enabling one to probe the atoms and molecules adsorbed on the nanotube wall",

    "this study complements our previous investigations of the effects of dynamic polarization on the angular distributions of protons channeled through the nanotubes , where we found that the image force gives rise to the rainbow effect @xcite , which can be strongly affected by the surrounding dielectric medium for the proton speeds above 3 a.u .",
    "similarly , our present study has revealed that the prominent rainbow maxima exist in the spatial distributions of channeled protons , which correspond to the well - defined extrema in the mapping of the entrance transverse plane to the exit transverse plane .",
    "while the rainbows in the angular distributions of channeled ions can be easily measured and applied to provide information on the structure and atomic forces inside the nanotubes , the rainbows in the spatial distributions of channeled ions can be employed for detecting and locating the atoms and molecules intercalated in the nanotubes .    specifically , besides the strong central maxima in all the spatial distributions of channeled protons , we have found that , as the nanotube length increases , the very weak maxima lying near the nanotube wall are present too , without and with the image force and the dielectric media included .",
    "however , our most important finding is the prominent peripheral maxima in the spatial distributions at the distances from the nanotube wall of the order of a few tenths of a nanometer .",
    "these distances are perfectly suitable for applying proton channeling to probe the atoms and molecules adsorbed on the nanotube wall .",
    "we have revealed that the image force is responsible for the appearance of the additional prominent peripheral maxima as well as for making them more prominent at the expense of the central maximum , as the nanotube length increases .",
    "since the spatial distribution of channeled protons gives us a detailed information about the proton flux within the nanotube , it appears that a careful studying of the speed dependence of the image force as well as of the properties of the nanotube and its surrounding can help us better understand and perhaps even find a way to induce a spatial redistribution of channeled protons towards the nanotube wall to be used for probing the atoms and molecules intercalated in the nanotube .",
    "besides such diagnostic applications , we would like to mention the possibility of producing nanosized ion beams with the nanotubes embedded in various dielectric media for applications in biomedical research @xcite .",
    "our findings can shed more light on the issue of shape of the spatial distribution of channeled ions suitable for such applications , especially if there are concerns about the increase of the proton flux in the peripheral region of a nanosized ion beam at the expense of the flux in its central region .",
