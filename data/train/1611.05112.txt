    "recall that finite groups generated by complex reflections have been classified by shephard and todd  @xcite .",
    "such a group @xmath0 comes with an isometric action on @xmath1 ( for the fubini - study metric ) , and the quotient of @xmath2 turns out to be a weighted projective space .",
    "in fact the ring of invariant polynomials in @xmath3 variables is generated by homogeneous polynomials @xmath4 , where @xmath5 has degree @xmath6 , hence the quotient , which is given by the projective spectrum of the ring of invariants , is the weighted projective plane @xmath7 .",
    "note that the weights can be computed from simple combinatorial data , since the degrees satisfy @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is equal to the number of reflections in the group ( see  @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "an analogous classification has been produced for affine crystallographic complex reflection groups , see  @xcite .",
    "the basis for the classification of affine groups is the fact that the group of automorphisms of affine space @xmath10 is a semi - direct product @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the vector space of translations in @xmath10 , which allows us to reduce the classification to the problem of classifying extensions of finite unitary reflection groups by a lattice in @xmath10 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath0 is an affine crystallographic group , the quotient @xmath13 is the quotient of a complex torus by a finite group .",
    "note that in general , @xmath0 is not the semi - direct product of its linear part and its translation subgroup ( see p.57 in  @xcite ) .",
    "it was observed by bernstein and schwarzman  @xcite that , at least in many cases , if @xmath0 is generated by complex reflections , the quotient @xmath13 is again a weighted projective plane .",
    "the heart of their proof is to construct suitable @xmath14-functions that play the role of the homogeneous invariant polynomials in the shephard - todd - chevalley theorem , which they managed to do only when the linear part of @xmath0 is a real coxeter group ( in that case , the weights of the weighted projective space are given by the so - called _ exponents _ of the corresponding coxeter group ) .",
    "some quotients @xmath15 , where @xmath0 is an affine crystallographic complex reflection group whose linear part is not a coxeter group , were worked out by kaneko , tokunaga and yoshida  @xcite , building on the bernstein - schwarzman result .",
    "the corresponding quotients turn out to be explicit weighted projective planes , but their proof does not shed much light on the general case . still , for a general affine crystallographic complex reflection group @xmath0 , it is believed that the quotient @xmath16 should be a weighted projective space ( see p.  17 of  @xcite ) .    in this note",
    ", we investigate a particular affine crystallographic complex reflection group @xmath0 , whose linear part is the shephard - todd group @xmath17 , and whose subgroup of translations is given by the lattice @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , there is an extension @xmath19 and one can think of the quotient @xmath15 as the quotient of the abelian surface @xmath20 by the group @xmath17 . for concreteness , we mention that the group @xmath17 has order 48 , it is a central extension of the octahedral group , and it is also known to be isomorphic to @xmath21 .",
    "our group @xmath0 is not a semi - direct product ( equivalently the sequence   does not split ) , which characterizes it uniquely up affine equivalence , according to  @xcite .",
    "note also that the action of @xmath17 has no global fixed point in the abelian surface @xmath22 , so our action is _ not _ the same as the action given by birkenhake and lange ( see theorem 13.4.5 in  @xcite )    since @xmath17 is not a coxeter group , it is not in the list of groups treated by bernstein and schwarzman , and it is not in the list of groups treated by kaneko , tokunaga and yoshida , so the structure of the quotient seems to be unknown .",
    "we will show that the quotient @xmath23 has two singular points of type @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , and that the map @xmath26 ramifies with order 2 along a ( highly singular ) rational curve in @xmath27 , which is given by the image of the union of all mirrors of complex reflections in the group @xmath0 . we refer to the branch locus as the discriminant curve , and denote it by @xmath28 .",
    "it does not contain any of the singular points of @xmath27 , and the curve @xmath28 has four singular points , two ordinary cusps , a point with multiplicity four and another with multiplicity 6 ( see figure  [ fig : models ] for a schematic picture of the singularities of @xmath28 ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath27 is indeed a weighted projective plane , the list of its singular points shows that it must be isomorphic to @xmath29 .",
    "the curve @xmath28 would then be an irreducible curve of homogeneous degree 24 , whose explicit equation remains elusive ( see  @xcite for the analogous equation in the case of @xmath30 in relation to the klein quartic ) .",
    "we can rephrase the preceding paragraphs as follows .",
    "[ thm : affine ] the pair @xmath31 is an orbifold which is uniformized by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the affine crystallographic complex reflection group @xmath0 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : affine ] parallels proposition  2 of  @xcite , which says that @xmath30 , with a specific curve with weight @xmath34 , gives an orbifold uniformized by the positively curved complex space form @xmath35 .",
    "the main result in  @xcite is obtained by changing @xmath36 to higher integer values , i.e. changing the weight of the curve to be @xmath37 ( in fact , for most values of @xmath38 , more subtle modifications are needed ) .",
    "it is then tempting to mimic the construction of  @xcite , and to consider the pairs @xmath39 for integer values @xmath40 ( in fact , it is convenient to allow also @xmath41 ) .",
    "the basic questions are the following .",
    "when is the pair @xmath39 an orbifold ? when it is an orbifold , is it modeled on a space form ?",
    "b.   when it is not an orbifold , is there a suitable model birational to it that is an orbifold ?",
    "if so , is that orbifold modeled on a space form ?",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to show that , even though the answer to ( i ) ( only for @xmath36 ) may seem disappointing , there is an affirmative answer to question ( ii ) for some other well - chosen values of @xmath38 , namely @xmath42 or @xmath43 . for these values ,",
    "the universal cover is the 2-dimensional complex space form of curvature @xmath44 , which we denote by @xmath45 ( for basic facts on the complex hyperbolic plane @xmath45 and lattices in its isometry group , see section  [ sec : chg ] ) .",
    "the precise statements are somewhat technical ( they will only be given in section  [ sec : statement ] ) , because on the one hand the birational modifications are not that easy to describe , and on the other only a proper open set turns out to be uniformized by @xmath45 .",
    "for now we suggest that the reader keeps in mind that the statements below roughly say that there is a indeed a complex hyperbolic uniformization of suitable open sets in the pairs @xmath39 , for @xmath46 .    for @xmath47",
    ", we will prove the following .",
    "[ thm : baby ] the pair @xmath48 is a compactification of a ball quotient .",
    "more precisely , there is a lattice @xmath49 with one cusp , such that @xmath50 has 1-point compactification isomorphic to @xmath27 .",
    "modulo this isomorphism , the quotient map @xmath51 branches with order @xmath52 along @xmath53 , which is obtained from @xmath28 by removing its point with multiplicity 6 .",
    "note that the presence of a 1-dimensional branch locus for the quotient map @xmath54 says that the lattice @xmath55 contains complex reflections , we will see later that it is actually generated by complex reflections .",
    "observe also that the point that needs to be removed from @xmath27 in order to get a ball quotient is characterized by the fact that it is the only point where the pair @xmath48 is not log - terminal , see section  [ sec : statement ] ) .",
    "the orbifold structure on @xmath56 does not lift to an orbifold structure on the abelian surface @xmath22 , since the corresponding weights on the preimage of the discriminant curve would have to be equal to @xmath57 , which is not an integer .",
    "there are statements analogous to theorem  [ thm : baby ] for @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath41 , but then the pair @xmath39 is actually not an orbifold , and one needs to perform a suitable birational modification before it becomes one .",
    "after suitable modification , for each case @xmath58 , @xmath59 or @xmath41 , one gets an orbifold which is uniformized by @xmath45 , with orbifold fundamental group given by a non - cocompact lattice @xmath60 .",
    "for now we simply give a rough statement .",
    "[ thm : rough ] there are a lattices @xmath61 , @xmath62 such that @xmath63 has a compactification birational to @xmath27 .",
    "the groups @xmath60 have one cusp for @xmath64 , two cusps for @xmath65 .",
    "the explicit birational transformation that yields the corresponding compactification will be given later in the paper ( see section  [ sec : statement ] , theorem  [ thm : main ] in particular ) .",
    "for the groups that appear in theorem  [ thm : rough ] , the weight of the orbifold structure along ( the strict transform of ) the discriminant curve is even , so the orbifold structure on ( the suitable surface birational to ) @xmath56 lifts to an orbifold structure on ( a suitable blow up of ) the abelian surface @xmath22 , with multiplicity @xmath66 , @xmath67 or @xmath43 respectively at a generic point of the union of mirrors of reflections of @xmath0 . the fact that the orbifold structure lifts to @xmath22 only when @xmath38 is even has a similar incarnation in deligne - mostow theory , when passing from the picard integrality condition int to the condition @xmath68-int ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .    for @xmath69 and @xmath59 , the lattices @xmath60 turn out to be conjugate to lattices constructed by the author in joint work with parker and paupert , see  @xcite and  @xcite , namely the groups @xmath70 , generated by a complex reflection @xmath71 of angle @xmath72 , and a regular elliptic element @xmath73 of order 3 such that @xmath74 for basic notation on these groups , see section  [ sec : sporadic ] .",

    "it has one cusp for @xmath75 , two cusps for @xmath58 .",
    "note also that the three groups can be checked to be generated by complex reflections , namely by @xmath71 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see section  [ sec : sporadic ] ) .",
    "we will prove the following .",
    "for every @xmath42 , the group @xmath60 is conjugate in @xmath78 to the group @xmath70 .    in particular , because of the analysis in  @xcite , we know that the @xmath60 , @xmath42 are non - arithmetic lattices . the group corresponding to @xmath41 does not appear in  @xcite , but it is in a sense less interesting since it turns out to be arithmetic .",
    "complex hyperbolic lattices have been previously constructed from configurations of elliptic curves on an abelian surface .",
    "one important construction was worked out by livne , see  @xcite ( and also  @xcite ) , from a point of view that is fairly different from ours .",
    "another construction , closer in spirit to the results in this paper , appears in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite for recent developments ) .    just as in  @xcite , the results of this paper give an alternative construction of certain non - arithmetic ball quotients , whose existence was known so far only by giving explicit matrix generators and constructing a fundamental domain for their action ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis in  @xcite shows that some of the non - arithmetic lattices in  @xcite , even though they are not commensurable to deligne - mostow lattices ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , are commensurable to couwenberg - heckman - looijenga lattices ( see  @xcite , which was inspired in part by  @xcite ) . for brevity , we refer to these two classes of lattices as dm and chl lattices , respectively ( note that dm lattices are special cases of chl lattices ) .",
