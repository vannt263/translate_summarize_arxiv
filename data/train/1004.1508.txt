    "the term _ sub - riemannian manifold _ means the triple @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an @xmath4-dimensional manifold , @xmath5 is a smoothly varying @xmath6-dimensional distribution inside the tangent bundle @xmath7 of the manifold @xmath3 with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a riemannian metric defined on @xmath5 , i.  e. , a positively definite quadratic form .",
    "recently the study of geometric structures , where the riemannian metric @xmath9 on @xmath5 is substituted by a semi - riemannian metric @xmath10 , that is a non - degenerate indefinite metric , started e.  g. , in  @xcite .",
    "there is no special attribution so far for such kind of manifolds @xmath11 , thus we propose to call them _ sub - semi - riemannian _ manifolds or shortly _ ssr - manifolds_. in the particular case , when the metric @xmath10 has index 1 , an ssr - manifold receives the name _ sub - lorentzian _ manifold by the analogy to lorentzian manifold .    in the present article we study an example of @xmath5-type group furnished with the sub - lorentzian metric .",
    "this is an interesting example not only as an almost unique known example of sub - lorentzian manifold but also because it has a precise physical meaning . in the article",
    "we reveal the connection between sub - lorentzian geometry and physics of relativistic electrodynamics basing on the example of @xmath12-type quaternion group equipped with the lorentzian metric .",
    "we also compare characterising features of sub - riemannian and sub - lorentzian geometries . the notion of @xmath5-type groups",
    "was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it is known that riemannian manifolds have applications in classical mechanics .",
    "sub - riemannian manifolds of step 2 ( heisenberg manifolds ) play important role in quantum mechanics .",
    "sub - riemannian geodesics even localy behave very differently from the ones in riemannian geometry , where the energy minimising motion is described by a unique geodesic .",
    "a sub - atomic particle behaves in a way similar to an electron which moves only along a given set of directions .",
    "there can be infinitely many geodesics with different length joining two points .",
    "in its turn , the sub - lorentzian structure underlise the motion in an electro - magnetic field .",
    "just like space and time emerge in special relativity , the electric and magnetic fields can not be considered separately .",
    "the sub - lorentzian structure absorbes both phenomena , the presence of the electro - magnetic field and the the space - time geometry . that is why the @xmath1-type quaternion group with a sub - lorentzian metric is an interesting example to work with .    in the introduction in order to explain the main idea we would like to mention the heisenberg group as the simplest noncommutative example of @xmath13-type ( heisenberg type ) groups and its numerous connections with physics .",
    "the heisenberg group is the manifold @xmath14 with the noncommutative group law @xmath15 left - invariant vector fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 are obtained from the group law and span a 2-dimensional distribution @xmath5 which is called horizontal .",
    "the horizontal distribution can be also defined as the kernel of the contact one - form @xmath18 in @xmath14 .",
    "the differential of @xmath19 is the 2-form @xmath20 that satisfies the maxwell s equation @xmath21 for the magnetic field @xmath22 in @xmath23 .",
    "let us define a riemannian metric @xmath24 on @xmath5 .",

    "it turned out that the geodesic equation for geodesics @xmath26 satisfying the non - holonomic constraints @xmath27 coincides up to a constant with the lorentz equation of motion of the charged particle in the magnetic field @xmath22 .",
    "if we change riemannian metric on @xmath5 on the lorentzian one @xmath28 we come to the notion of sub - lorentzian heisenberg group @xmath29 . in this case",
    "the geodesic equation for non - holonomic geodesics coincides with analogue of the lorentz equation for the motion of a charged particle in the electromagnetic field defined by @xmath22 and the lorentzian metric tensor .",
    "the geodesics , metrics properties , and other related questions on @xmath30 were studied in  @xcite .",
    "the lack of the dimension of the horizontal distribution on the heisenberg group does not allow to reveal the peculiarity of the applications in the case of the magnetic and electromagnetic fields .",
    "therefore , we chose the analogue of the heisenberg group admitting a 4-dimensional distribution , that we called quaternionic @xmath13-type group .",
    "this example allows also to show similarities and differences between the sub - riemannian and sub - lorentzian geometries .",
