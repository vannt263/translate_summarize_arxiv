    "the _ r-_modes in a perfect fluid star succumb to gravitational radiation ( gr ) driven chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz instability for all rates of stellar rotation , and they arise due to the action of the coriolis force with positive feedback increasing gr ( andersson 1998 ; friedman & morsink 1998 ) .",
    "however , actually , the viscosity of stellar matter can hold back the growth of the modes effectively . based on the competition between the destabilizing effect of gr and the damping effect of viscosity , owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) modelled the evolution of the _ r-_modes and described the spin - down of neutron stars as losing angular momentum to gr . afterwards , ho & lai ( 2000 ) improved the model considering the conservation of wave action and containing the magnetic braking due to magnetic dipole radiation ( mdr ) .",
    "the viscosity of stellar matter is decisive for the _ r-_mode evolution and hence for the spin - down and cooling of the star .",
    "the bulk viscosity of strange quark matter in the normal phase is several orders of magnitude stronger than that of normal nuclear matter . as a consequence",
    ", the instability in a strange star ( ss ) can only be driven at relatively lower temperature ( @xmath0k ) , which means not very early ages , differing from the case of a neutron star in which the instability acts immediately at the birth of the star ( owen et al .",
    "1998 ; watts & andersson 2002 ) .",
    "thus madsen ( 2000 ) argued the evolution of sss can be very different from that of neutron stars .",
    "andersson , jones & kokkotas ( 2002 ) calculated the evolution of sss thoroughly using the model of ho & lai ( 2000 ) ( but without a magnetic field ) in the presence of accretion to point out that sss may be persistent sources of gr .",
    "however , most works always focused on the stars with _ r-_mode instability as sources of gr , although the authors also claimed that the _ r-_modes could change the spin evolution of the stars due to gr and induce heating due to viscous dissipation of the modes .",
    "we also note the work of gusakov , yakovlev , & gnedin ( 2005 ) who studied the thermal evolution of a pulsating neutron star , taking into account the pulsation damping due to viscosity and accompanying heating of the star .",
    "this idea leads us to pay attention to the effect of the _ r-_mode instability on the evolution of compact stars . as shown in fig . 5 in watts & andersson ( 2002 ) , by heating due to _ r-_mode damping ,",
    "the cooling of a nascent neutron star is delayed in the first few decades . in addition , the calculation in andersson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) implies that the history of the _ r-_modes in isolated sss could be longer than neutron stars . according to the above works , we consider that a careful investigation of the effect of the _ r-_mode instability on the evolution of sss is an interesting topic , which we will focus on in this paper . as expected , our results show that , although the _ r-_modes may be too small to induce a detectable gr at the age of a million years , the accompanying heating effect still can not be ignored in sss .",
    "in particular , our attention is attracted by the same consideration of colour superconducting sss . for strange quark",
    "matter at a sufficiently high density , phenomenological and microscopic studies predict it could undergo a phase transition into a colour superconducting state , such as the typical cases of two - flavour colour superconductivity ( 2sc ) and the colour - flavour locked ( cfl ) phase ( shovkovy 2005 ; alford 2004 ) .",
    "theoretical approaches also concur that the pairing gap ( @xmath1 ) in the quark spectrum is approximately @xmath2mev for baryon densities existing in the interior of compact stars . in this case , the reaction rates involving two quarks are reduced by a factor @xmath3 , assuming equal behaviour for all quark flavours . because the quarks in the 2sc phase pair in part , the corresponding sss will have similar behaviours to sss in normal phase ( nss hereafter ; blaschke , kl@xmath4hn , & voskresensky 2000 ; madsen 2000 ; yu & zheng 2006 ) . therefore",
    ", here we only account for sss in cfl phase ( css hereafter ) with @xmath5mev , in which all flavour quarks pair . as a consequence , all of the viscosity",
    ", the neutrino emissivity and the quark specific heat of csss are reduced .",
    "thus the effect of the _ r-_mode instability on the evolution of csss may become more important . as shown in section 5 , the dramatic variation in the stellar evolution changes our previous understanding of csss that the stars are very cold and slow revolving objects ( blaschke et al 2000 ; madsen 2000 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 and 3 we recall the _",
    "r-_mode instability and the model of spin evolution due to gravitational and magnetic braking respectively .",
    "the thermal evolution equation of sss considering the heating due to the viscous dissipation of the _ r-_modes is given in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents the numerical results of the evolution of nsss and csss .",
    "finally , we give the conclusion and our discussions in the last section .",
    "the _ r-_modes of rotating newtonian stars are generally defined to be solutions of the perturbed fluid equations having ( eulerian ) velocity perturbations of the form ( lindblom , owen & morsink 1998 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the radius and angular velocity of the unperturbed star , @xmath9 is an arbitrary constant considered as the amplitude of the _ r-_modes ( owen et ale 1998 ) , and @xmath10 is the magnetic - type vector spherical harmonic defined by @xmath11^{-1/2}r\\vec{\\nabla } \\times(r \\vec{\\nabla}y_{l\\,m}).\\ ] ] papaloizou & pringle ( 1978 ) first showed that the euler equation for _ r-_modes determines the frequencies as @xmath12 further use of the euler equation ( as first noted by provost , berthomieu & rocca 1981 ) in the barotropic case determines that only @xmath13 _ r-_modes exist and that @xmath14 must have the radial dependence given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "these modes represent large - scale oscillating currents that move ( approximately ) along the equipotential surfaces of the rotating star .",
    "the density perturbation associated with the _ r-_modes can be deduced by evaluating the inner product of @xmath15 ( the unperturbed fluid velocity ) with the perturbed euler equation , and the equation for the perturbed gravitational potential ( lindblom et ale 1998 ) : @xmath16y_{l+1\\,l } \\,e^{i\\omega t}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath17 is proportional to the perturbed gravitational potential @xmath18 and is the solution to the ordinary differential equation @xmath19\\delta \\psi(r ) \\nonumber\\\\",
    "\\qquad = -   { 8\\pi g l\\over 2l+1 } \\sqrt{l\\over l+1 } \\rho { d\\rho\\over dp}\\left({r\\over r}\\right)^{l+1}. \\end{array}\\ ] ]    the _ r-_modes evolve with time dependence @xmath20 as a consequence of ordinary hydrodynamics and the influence of the various dissipative processes .",
    "the real part of the frequency of these modes , @xmath21 , is given in equation ( 3 ) , while the imaginary part @xmath22 is determined by the effects of gr , viscosity , etc .",
    "the simplest way to evaluate @xmath22 is to compute the time derivative of the energy @xmath23 of the mode ( as measured in the rotating frame ) .",
    "@xmath23 can be expressed as a real quadratic functional of the fluid perturbations : @xmath24d^3x.\\ ] ] thus , the time derivative of @xmath23 is related to the imaginary part of the frequency @xmath22 , which can be conveniently decomposed into two parts associated with gr and viscosity , respectively .",
    "it reads @xmath25 for @xmath26 polytrope , the time - scale for gr is calculated by lindblom , mendell & owen ( 1999 ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean density of the star .",
    "the viscous time - scale is contributed by shear and bulk viscosity as @xmath29 for strange quark matter , we can give ( lindblom et al .",
    "1999 ; madsen 2000 ) @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the strong coupling in units of 0.1 , the mass of strange quark in units of 100mev and the interior temperature of the stars in units of @xmath35k , respectively .",
    "when these viscosities due to quark reactions are blocked in the cfl phase , the dissipation of the _ r-_modes will be mainly dominated by a smaller shear viscosity due to electron - electron scattering .",
    "the corresponding time - scale is ( madsen 2000 ) @xmath36 from equation ( 7 ) , it can be seen that the _ r-_modes are unstable if @xmath37 . in this case",
    ", a small perturbation will lead to an unbounded growth of the modes .",
    "the competition between the destabilizing effect of gr that is dependent on spin frequency and the damping effect of the temperature - dependent viscosity gives an instability window in the @xmath38 plane , as shown by the shadows in the following figures .",
    "we can see that , compared with the window of an nss , the window of a css expands significantly because its viscosity involving quarks are blocked .",
    "we employ a simple phenomenological spin evolution model proposed by ho & lai ( 2000 ) , which is analogous to that devised by owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in this case",
    ", the total angular momentum of a star can be obtained as the sum of the bulk angular momentum and the canonical angular momentum of the _ r-_modes @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 for @xmath26 polytrope ) represents the moment of inertia of the star .",
    "the canonical angular momentum of an _",
    "r-_mode can be expressed in terms of the velocity perturbation @xmath43 by ( friedman & schutz 1978 ) @xmath44 for the ( dominant ) @xmath45 current multipole of the _ r-_modes , the above expression reduces ( at the lowest order in @xmath8 ) to @xmath46 where @xmath47 for @xmath26 polytrope .",
    "the canonical angular momentum of the mode can increase through gr back reaction and decrease by transferring angular momentum to the star through viscosity : @xmath48 on the other hand , adding the reverse angular momentum transferred from the _ r-_mode , the bulk angular momentum of the star decreases . at the same time",
    ", the star also undergoes braking by mdr .",
    "thus the rotation of the star is determined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the magnetic braking time - scale , and @xmath51 is the magnetic field intensity in units of @xmath52 g .    submitting equation ( 15 ) into equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 )",
    ", we can obtain the coupled evolution equations of the amplitude @xmath9 of the _ r-_mode and the angular velocity @xmath8 : @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 . in some cases",
    ", the small initial perturbation could increase to a large value so that non - linear effects can no longer be ignored . as postulated by owen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , there may exist a saturation amplitude @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath57 , the growth of the amplitude of the mode stops , then @xmath58 in this stage , the spin evolution will be described as @xmath59 of fundamental importance in judging the astrophysical relevance of the instability is the determination of the saturation amplitude of the mode .",
    "lindblom , tohline & vallisneri ( 2001 , 2002 ) suggested that the non - linear saturation amplitude may be set by dissipation of energy in the production of shock waves .",
    "however , gressman et al . ( 2002 ) argued that the decay of the amplitude of the order unity is due to leaking of energy into other fluid modes , leading to a differential rotation configuration .",
    "afterward , the coupling between the _ r_-modes and other modes was analyzed ( arras et ale 2003 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the role of differential rotation in the evolution of the _",
    "r_-mode was also studied thoroughly ( s@xmath60 & tom@xmath61 2005 ) .",
    "all these works obtained a credible conclusion that the saturation amplitude of the _ r_-mode may be not larger than the small value of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we take @xmath63 in our calculations .",
    "the saturation amplitude is important for the evolution of csss because the _ r-_mode in csss will retain the saturated state for a long time .",
    "however , to a certain extent , the uncertainty of the saturation value can only influence our numerical results quantitatively , but can not change the conclusions essentially .",
    "note that , for nsss , this artificial cut of the amplitude is needless , as is also claimed by andersson et al .",
    "an ss can be divided roughly into an inner , approximately isothermal , quark core and a thin , solid , nuclear crust ( alcock , farhi & olinto 1986 ) . for the relationship between the interior temperature @xmath64 and the surface temperature @xmath65 , we apply the result given by gudmundsson , pethick & epstein ( 1983 ) , which is valid for a crust with the density at the base that is just larger than @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the emissivity due to the surface photon emission can be written as @xmath67 besides the contribution from this thermal radiation , sss also cool via internal neutrino emission . in",
    "strange quark matter , there are three main neutrino processes : ( i ) direct urca processes @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; ( ii ) modified urca processes @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; ( iii ) the quark bremsstrahlung processes @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding neutrino emissivities read respectively ( iwamoto , 1982 ) @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the baryon number density and @xmath77 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "@xmath78 is the electron fraction . on the other hand",
    ", sss also can be heated . during gr ,",
    "in addition to the losing of angular momentum , the _ r-_modes also can lose energy via gr and neutrino emission ( from bulk viscosity ) and can deposit energy into the thermal state of the star via shear viscous dissipation ( owen et al .",
    "as defined in equation ( 6 ) , for the @xmath45 current multipole , the energy of the _ r-_mode is @xmath79 , and the heating rate is @xmath80 thus the thermal evolution equation is written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the neutrino luminosity and the surface photon luminosity respectively , and @xmath84 is the total specific heat , which is mainly contributed by quarks and electrons ( blaschke et al .",
    "2000 ) : @xmath85 @xmath86 in the calculation for csss , the reductive factor due to the pairing gap should be added in equations ( 23)-(25 ) and ( 28 ) . in other words , the electron specific heat ,",
    "the surface photon emission and the heating term become more important for the thermal evolution of csss .",
    "in our calculations , we take the initial temperature @xmath87k , the initial angular velocity @xmath88 , and a representative set of parameters of @xmath89 , @xmath90mev for sss .",
    "we firstly discuss the evolution of nsss .",
    "the stellar evolution tracks in the @xmath38 plane for different magnetic fields are shown in fig . 1 and",
    "several typical ages are marked on the tracks using open cycles .",
    "2 shows the amplitude evolution of the _ r-_mode with time corresponding to the same field cases .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "1(b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , just as calculated by andersson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for @xmath91 , that the stars for non - ultrastrong ( @xmath92 g ) field cases will reach the instability windows several days after birth as a result of temperature decrease and will then evolve along the boundary of the windows .",
    "however , we also find that the specific history of the stars is sensitively dependent on the magnetic field intensity .",
    "it can be seen from the labelled ages that , the weaker the field , the slower the spin - down and the cooling . especially with very weak",
    "( @xmath93 g ) fields , the stars can remain at a very high spin frequency , such as 400hz , even at the age of over a million years .",
    "finally , the evolution tracks will depart from the instability windows at the moment that the magnetic braking effect exceeds that of gr ( see the upper panel of fig.3 ) .",
    "thus , the stronger the field , the earlier the departure .",
    "synchronously , this departure also leads to the end ( a catastrophically decay ) of the _ r-_mode as shown in fig .",
    "2 . before this abrupt drop , however , the variation of the mode is small apart from the first several decades , during which the amplitude of the _ r-_mode oscillates greatly until it converges to a value of @xmath94 as discussed by andersson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . at the extreme , a star with an ultrastrong ( @xmath95 g ) field decelerates so rapidly due to mdr that the track will not come into contact with the instability window as shown in fig .",
    "thus , no _ r-_mode arises in the star throughout its life as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) . to be clear , fig .",
    "3 shows the evolution curves of spin frequency ( upper panel ) and surface temperature ( lower panel ) corresponding to the cases shown in fig .",
    "not surprising , being governed by eq .",
    "( 19 ) , the spin history of the stars with non - ultrastrong ( @xmath92 g ) fields can be divided into two stages : ( i ) the stage due to angular momentum transfer by viscosity ( losing angular momentum via gr ultimately ) at early ages in the presence of the _ r-_mode ; and ( ii ) the stage due to mdr in the absence of the _ r-_mode . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in the lower panel , the cooling of the stars with weak fields is delayed under the impact of heating due to the viscous dissipation of the _",
    "r-_mode , whereas the curve of the strong field superposes the curve without the consideration of the _ r-_mode instability .    in the second situation ,",
    "colour superconductivity suppresses the cooling effect extremely , whereas the heating effect is enhanced considerably . the evolution tracks of csss in the @xmath38 plane for different magnetic fields and the corresponding amplitude evolution curves of the _ r-_mode are shown in fig . 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "the same as figs 3 but for csss are also shown in fig .",
    "differing from nsss , the _ r-_mode in csss can appear at the birth of the stars and quickly ( @xmath96s , as shown clearly in fig .",
    "5 ) rise to the saturated state because the bulk viscosity is blocked .",
    "however , at the same time , the temperature nearly does not decrease because the neutrino cooling effect is suppressed .",
    "however , because the specific heat is only contributed from electrons , the temperature decreases finally in the following several hundred years until the photon luminosity is nearly compensated by the heat gain from the shear viscous dissipation of the _ r-_mode .",
    "from then on , the stars should experience a long - term slow cooling stage . as discussed by blaschke et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and yu & zheng ( 2006 ) previously , csss will become very cold at early ages ( @xmath97yrs ) if the heating effect is ignored .",
    "however , the presence of the long - term slow cooling stage can change the situation completely as shown in fig .",
    "6 ( lower panel ) .",
    "we can see the surface temperature can remain at a high value of @xmath98k lasting several million years .",
    "the spin - down of csss that is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 is similar to the one of nsss , but the stage dominated by gr is much longer because the life of the _ r-_mode in csss is longer as shown in fig.5 .",
    "we have studied the evolution of sss synthetically , considering the influence of _ r-_mode instability .",
    "the spin history is divided into two stages and the heating effect due to viscous dissipation of the _ r-_mode can delay the cooling of sss with non - ultrastrong fields remarkably . our prime objective is to investigate the behaviour of sss in colour superconducting phase ( to be specific , the cfl phase ) .",
    "this problem is estimated simply by madsen ( 2000 ) , who argued that csss should spin - down to a very low spin frequency for hours due to the _ r-_mode instability .",
    "conversely , our results indicate that the stars can be located at the bottom of the window for millions of years due to their characteristic cooling behaviour .",
    "a css could be a rapid revolving pulsar .",
    "differing from nsss , the cooling of csss is changed completely by heating due to _ r-_mode damping . except for the first several hundred years , csss cool very slowly . in other words ,",
    "the stars can remain at a high temperature over several million years but do not become very cold at early ages as calculated in the absence of the heating effect .",
    "thus , we believe that it is possible to detect a hot source being a css but not , as argued by blaschke et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , that csss are rejected by the x - ray data .    in our opinion , when we talk about stellar evolution , we must consider the cooling and the spin - down synthetically because the rotation of the star is a large possible energy store for the heating of the star .",
    "we note that reisenegger ( 1995 ) proposed a chemical heating mechanism due to the derivative from the @xmath99equilibrium of neutron matter with the spin - down of neutron stars .",
    "the same issue was discussed in nsss by cheng & dai ( 1996 ) , who presented that chemical heating delays the later ( @xmath100yrs ) cooling of nsss significantly . in this paper , however , it is the _",
    "r-_mode instability that couples the cooling and the spin - down : the kinetic energy transforms into the canonical energy of the _ r-_modes via gr , then is deposited into a thermal state via the dissipation of the _ r-_modes .",
    "our results show that the heating due to the _ r-_mode damping delays the earlier ( @xmath101yrs ) cooling remarkably .",
    "to summarize , we argue that the heating due to spin - down plays an important role in the evolution of an nss throughout its life . on the other hand , for a css",
    ", the chemical heating is blocked because the reactions between the quarks are suppressed by the pairing gap .",
    "thus , the heating due to the _",
    "r-_mode damping becomes more decisive for its evolution . as discussed above",
    ", the spin - down can impact the cooling of an ss as an energy source .",
    "besides this direct influence , the spin evolution also can determine the change of other properties of the star , such as the variation of the density of the star .",
    "we therefore think that the spin - down can also impact the cooling behaviour indirectly .",
    "looking at more detailed calculations , previous modelling of thermal evolution of sss based on the assumption that the spin - down is only determined by mdr needs to be reconsidered because it is gr but not mdr that dominates the first spin - down of the star in the presence of the _ r-_modes .    using nsss , several authors ( madsen , 2000 ; andersson et al .",
    "2002 ) try to explain the clustering of low mass x - ray binaries in the @xmath38 plane . our results ( fig .",
    "1 ) show that , for weak - field ( @xmath93 g ) cases , mdr has no influence on the spin - down of the stars that are younger than 10 million years old .",
    "this implies the existence of a weak magnetic field in millisecond pulsars if we follow the same philosophy that has been used by madsen ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , in our opinion , the final clarification of this problem should dependent on careful consideration of the accretion of stars as watts & andersson ( 2002 ) did for neutron stars .",
