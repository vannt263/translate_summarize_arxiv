    "owing to the recent development of the gps technology , it has been recognized now that general forms of seismic activity could be of a rich variety , often including various types of slow slip events , _",
    "e.g. _ , a preslip , an afterslip , a slow earthquake , _",
    "etc_. from the viewpoint of earthquake forecast , a preslip , _",
    "i.e. _ , a slow - slip event occurring prior to a mainshock , would be of special significance .",
    "such a preslip prior to a mainshock is usually associated with the nucleation process which occurs preceeding the high - speed rupture of the mainshock .",
    "then , a wide - spread expectation is that a large earthquake might be preceded by a precursory nucleation process which occurs prior to the high - speed rupture of the mainshock .",
    "such a precursory phenomenon preceding mainshocks , if any , would be of paramount importance in its own right as well as in its possible connection to earthquake forecast .",
    "although the nucleation phenomena preceding the main rupture have been more or less confirmed by laboratory rock experiments @xcite , its nature , or even its very existence , remains less clear for real earthquakes @xcite .",
    "we note that a similar nucleation process is ubiquitously observed in various types of failure processes in material science and in engineering .",
    "nucleation process is supposed to be localized to a compact `` seed '' area with its rupture velocity orders of magnitude lower than the seismic wave velocity @xcite .",
    "the fault spends a very long time in this nucleation process , and then at some point , exhibits a rapid acceleration process accompanied by a rapid expansion of the rupture zone , finally getting into the final high - speed rupture of a mainshock",
    ".    the earthquake nucleation process might proceed via several distinct steps or `` phases '' . according to ohnaka",
    ", it starts with an initial quasi - static process , and gets into the acceleration phase when the nucleus diameter @xmath2 exceeds a nucleation length @xmath0 , where the system gets out of equilibrium , and rapidly increases its slip velocity @xcite .",
    "then , when the nucleus diameter exceeds another nucleation length @xmath3 , the fault eventually exhibits a high - speed rupture of a mainshock . in this picture , there appear two characteristic length scales for the nucleus , @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "these two nucleation lengths divide the nucleation process into `` the initial phase '' in which the nucleus size @xmath2 is smaller the @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) , `` the acceleration phase '' in which the nucleus size exceeds @xmath0 but is still smaller than @xmath1 ( @xmath6 ) , and `` the high - speed rupture phase '' of mainshock ( @xmath7 ) .    because of a slow character of the slip , earthquake nucleation process might also be regarded as a type of more general slow - slip phenomena , including afterslips and slow earthquakes . while the relation between these different types of slow seismic processes poses an interesting and important question , we focus in the present paper on the nucleation process _ prior to _ the high - speed rupture of mainshock .    under such circumstances , in order to get deeper understanding of the physical process behind the seismic nucleation process and the subsequent mainshock , a theoretical or a numerical study based on an appropriate model of an earthquake fault would be important and helpful . in such a physical modeling ,",
    "the friction force is a crucially important part .",
    "the friction force now standard in seismology is the so - called rate and state dependent friction ( rsf ) law @xcite . in the pioneering study",
    ", dieterich derived a formula describing the nucleation length based on such rsf law @xcite .",
    "the most standard form of the nucleation length based on the rsf law might be @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the normal stress , @xmath10 is the rigidity , @xmath11 is a characteristic slip distance and @xmath12 is a constant , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the frictional parameters associated with the rsf law , each representing the velocity - strengthening and the frictional - weakening parts of the friction .",
    "dieterich also suggested that under certain conditions the nucleation length might be given by @xcite @xmath15 in which the @xmath13 parameter did not appear .",
    "the rsf law has been used in many of numerical simulations on earthquakes , mostly in the continuum model @xcite , including the earthquake nucleation process .",
    "in particular , ampuero and rubin studied the properties of the nucleation process for the continuum model under the rsf law , with two representative evolution laws , _",
    "i.e. _ , the aging law @xcite and the slip law @xcite within the quasi - static approximation neglecting the inertia effect",
    ".    meanwhile , a further simplified _",
    "discrete _ model has also been used in earthquake studies .",
    "particularly popular is the so - called spring - block model or the burridge - knopoff ( bk ) model @xcite , in which an earthquake fault is modeled as an assembly of blocks mutually connected via elastic springs which are subject to the friction force and are slowly driven by an external force mimicking the plate drive .",
    "the model might be better justified in the situation where there exists a well - developed mature fault layer , presumably corresponding to the low - velocity fault zone @xcite observed in many mature faults @xcite .",
    "the fault layer is supposed to be uniformly pulled by the more or less rigid crust contingent to it .",
    "because of its simplicity , the bk model is particularly suited to the study of statistical properties of earthquakes , since it often enables one to generate sufficiently many events , say , hundreds of thousands of events , to reliably evaluate its statistical properties .",
    "this type of model might also be relevant to the description of other stick - slip - type phenomena such as landslides @xcite .    in many numerical simulations of the bk model",
    ", while a simple velocity - weakening friction law in which the friction force is assumed to be a single - valued decreasing function of the velocity has often been used @xcite , a more realistic rsf law was also employed in some of recent numerical simulations of the model . for example",
    ", cao and aki performed a numerical simulation by combining the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bk model with the rsf law in which various constitutive parameters were set nonuniform over blocks @xcite .",
    "ohmura and kawamura extended an earlier calculation by cao and aki to study the statistical properties of the 1d bk model combined with the rsf law with uniform constitutive parameters @xcite .",
    "clancy and corcoran also performed a simulation of the model based on a modified version of the rsf law @xcite .    of course , the space discretization in the form of blocks is a crude approximation to the original continuum crust .",
    "it introduces the short - length cut - off scale into the problem in the form of the block size , which could in principle give rise to an artificial effect not realized in the continuum .",
    "indeed , such a criticism against the bk model was made in the past @xcite .",
    "rice criticized that the discrete bk model with the simple velocity - weakening law was `` intrinsically discrete '' , lacking in a well - defined continuum limit , arguing that the spatiotemporal complexity observed in the discrete bk model was due to an inherent discreteness of the model , which should disappear in continuum @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the simple velocity - weakening law , the rsf law possesses an intrinsic length scale corresponding the characteristic slip distance @xmath16 .",
    "if the grid spacing @xmath17 was taken smaller than the nucleation length which is proportional to this characteristic slip distance @xmath16 , the system tended to exhibit a quasi - periodic recurrence of large events , whereas , if the grid spacing @xmath17 was taken larger than it , the system exhibited an apparently complex or critical behavior .",
    "note that the extent of the discreteness may be regarded as a measure of the underlying spatial inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "this problem of the continuum limit of the bk model was also addressed within the velocity - weakening friction law by myers and langer @xcite , by shaw @xcite , and by mori and kawamura @xcite , where the kelvin viscosity term was introduced to produce a small length scale allowing for a sensible continuum limit .",
    "in fact , the problem of the small length scale of the bk model is closely related to the nucleation phenomena . according to rice",
    ", the continuum system under the rsf law always exhibits a quasi - static nucleation process prior to a mainshock @xcite . in view of such a claim , and also of the general importance of the seismic nucleation phenomena , in the present paper we wish to clarify by means of extensive numerical simulations on the 1d bk model how the nucleation process of the discrete bk model behaves in its continuum limit , by systematically varying the extent of the discreteness of the model . by so doing",
    ", we also wish to clarify the nature of the nucleation process of the model , and discuss its implications to real seismicity .    of course , since the real fault plane is more or less two - dimensional ( 2d ) , the assumed one - dimensinality of our present model is a high simplification .",
    "while earlier studies suggested that most of qualitative features of the mainshock statistical properties could be captured even by the 1d model , there exists a possibility that , concerning the nucleation properties , the 2d model might exhibit a behavior different from the 1d model due to the richness of the underlying geometry @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "leaving a systematic study of the nucleation process of the 2d bk model as a future task , we first study the 1d model which is far simpler than the corresponding 2d model .    in such a way ,",
    "on the basis of the 1d bk model , we wish to shed light on the nucleation process of a mature fault , _",
    "e.g. _ , the nucleation dynamics , the nucleation lengths and the duration times of each phase of the nucleation process .",
    "how these quantities depend on material parameters , and are related or unrelated to the size of the ensuing mainshock ?",
    "such an issue would be of special significance from the standpoint of utilizing earthquake nucleation phenomena for a possible earthquake forecast .",
    "for example , if the nucleation length @xmath0 or @xmath1 is correlated with the mainshock size , _",
    "e.g. _ , a larger earthquake for a larger @xmath0 or @xmath1 , one might have a chance to predict the size of the mainshock from the measurement of the nucleation lengths . if , on the other hand , the nucleation length @xmath0 or @xmath1 is not correlated with the mainshock size , the prediction of the mainshock size from the measurement of the nucleation lengths would be impossible .    by its nature",
    ", the fault sliding velocity in the nucleation process tends to be very low .",
    "hence , for any practical detection , it would crucially be important to clarify how fast the fault sliding velocity is , and how much time is left before the ensuing mainshock . with these motivations in mind",
    ", we try to conduct a systematic numerical and analytic study of the bk model in the following part of the paper .",
    "a preliminary account of our simulations was already given in @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we conduct a systematic survey of more general parameter space , give detailed analytical treatments , and make comparison between theoretical and numerical results .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define our model , the 1d bk model obeying the rsf law , and present its equation of motion .",
    "its continuum limit is also given . in section iii",
    ", we report on the results of our numerical simulations on the dynamics of the nucleation process of the model . in subsection iii[a ] , we first illustrate mains features of the nucleation process .",
    "two distinct parameter regimes exist , _",
    "i.e. _ , the weak frictional instability regime and the strong frictional instability regime . the two kinds of nucleation lengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 are identified . in the subsequent subsections [ b]-[d ]",
    ", we present our numerical data on the dynamics of the model at each stage of its nucleation process , _ i.e. _ , [ b ] the initial phase of the weak frictional instability regime , [ c ] the acceleration phase of the weak frictional instability regime , and [ d ] the acceleration phase of the strong frictional instability regime . in section iv , we report on the results of our theoretical analyses of the nucleation process of the model . after explaining in subsection [ a ] the basic scheme of the perturbation method employed , we examine the dynamics of the model in some detail in the following subsections [ b]-[d ] , _ i.e. _ , [ b ] the initial phase , [ c ] the acceleration phase at which the epicenter - block sliding velocity @xmath18 is smaller than the crossover velocity @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and [ d ] the acceleration phase at @xmath21 .",
    "analytic expressions of the nucleation length @xmath0 and of the condition discriminating the weak and the strong frictional instability regimes is derived in subsection [ b ] . in subsection [ e ] , we perform a mechanical stability analysis to re - derive @xmath0 and the weak / strong instability condition , which confirms the results from the perturbation analysis . in section",
    "v , we present the results of our numerical simulations focusing on various statistical properties characterizing the nucleation process , including the nucleation lengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the duration times of each phase , averaged over many events .",
    "their continuum limits are also examined .",
    "finally , section vi is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "implications to real seismicity and possible extensions of the present analysis are discussed .",
    "the 1d bk model consists of a 1d array of @xmath22 identical blocks of the mass @xmath23 , which are mutually connected with the two neighboring blocks via the elastic springs of the spring stiffness @xmath24 , also connected to the moving plate via the springs of the spring stiffness @xmath25 , and are driven with a constant rate @xmath26 .",
    "all blocks are subject to the friction force @xmath27 , which is the source of the nonlinearity in the model .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath28-th block can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the time , @xmath31 is the displacement of the @xmath28-th block , and @xmath32 is the friction force at the @xmath28-th block . for simplicity ,",
    "the motion in the direction opposite to the plate drive is inhibited by imposing an infinitely large friction for @xmath33 .    for the friction law",
    ", we assume the rsf law given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sliding velocity of the @xmath28-th block , @xmath36 is the time - dependent state variable ( with the dimension of the time ) representing the `` state '' of the slip interface , @xmath37 is a crossover velocity underlying the rsf law , @xmath38 is an effective normal load , @xmath16 is a critical slip distance which is a measure of the sliding distance necessary for the surface to evolve to a new state , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 positive constants describing the rsf law .",
    "the first term ( @xmath40-term ) is a constant taking a value around @xmath41 , which dominates the total friction in magnitude , the second term ( @xmath13-term ) a velocity - strengthening direct term describing the part of the friction responding immediately to the velocity change , the third part ( @xmath14-term ) an indirect frictional - weakening term dependent of the state variable @xmath42 .",
    "laboratory experiments suggest that the @xmath13- and @xmath14-terms are smaller than the @xmath40-term by one or two orders of magnitudes , yet they play an essential role in stick - slip dynamics @xcite .    note that , in the standard rsf law , the @xmath13-term is often assumed to be proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "obviously , this form becomes pathological in the @xmath44 limit because it gives a negatively divergent friction .",
    "in other words , the pure logarithmic form of the @xmath13-term can not describe the state at rest .",
    "we cure this pathology by phenomenologically introducing a modified form given above .",
    "the modified form , where the @xmath13-term becomes proportional to the block velocity @xmath45 at @xmath46 but reduces to the purely logarithmic form at @xmath47 , enables one to describe a complete halt .",
    "the characteristic velocity @xmath37 represents a crossover velocity , describing the low - velocity cutoff of the logarithmic behavior of the friction .    for the evolution law of the state variable",
    "@xmath42 , we use here the so - called aging ( slowness ) law given by @xmath48 under this evolution law , the state variable @xmath49 grows linearly with the time at a complete halt @xmath50 , reaching a very large value at the outset of the nucleation process , while it decays very rapidly during the seismic rupture .",
    "the equation of motion can be made dimensionless by taking the length unit to be the critical slip distance @xmath16 , the time unit to be @xmath51 and the velocity unit to be @xmath52 , @xmath53 where the dimensionless variables are defined by @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , while @xmath63 is the dimensionless elastic stiffness parameter .",
    "it is sometimes more convenient to rewrite the equation of motion in terms of the velocity variable @xmath64 instead of the displacement @xmath65 . by differentiating ( [ eq - motion ] ) with respect to @xmath66 and by using ( [ aging ] ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath67 the block displacement @xmath65 can be obtained up to a constant by integrating the velocity @xmath64 with respect to @xmath66 .",
    "one sees from eqs.([eq - motion2 ] ) and ( [ aging ] ) that the constant frictional parameter @xmath68 no longer remains in the governing equations , meaning this parameter is essentially irrelevant to the dynamical properties of the model . in our simulations , we use either eq.([eq - motion ] ) or ( [ eq - motion2 ] ) depending on the situation . in solving the high - speed motion , we use eq.([eq - motion ] ) , while in solving the low - speed motion as realized in the initial phase or the early stage of the acceleration phase , we use eq.([eq - motion2 ] ) .",
    "the frictional parameter @xmath69/@xmath70 tends to suppress / enhance the frictional instability .",
    "the earthquake instability is driven primarily by the velocity - weakening @xmath70-term , while the velocity strengthening @xmath69-term tends to mitigate the unstable slip toward the aseismic slip . since the frictional parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 compete in their functions",
    ", either @xmath71 or @xmath72 might affect the dynamics significantly .",
    "earthquake properties in this regime of @xmath72 will be reported in a separate paper , with emphasis on the slow - slip phenomena intrinsic to this regime .",
    "meanwhile , we find that the properties of the precursory nucleation process of the model , which occurs preceding a mainshock , do not much depend on the relative magnitude of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "although we study in the present paper the nucleation process in the parameter range @xmath71 where the unstable seismic character is dominant in a mainshock , main qualitative features of the nucleation process would not change much even for @xmath72 .    the setting assumed in the bk model in terms of an earthquake fault embedded in the 3d continuum crust",
    "was examined in @xcite . in particular , estimates of typical values of the model parameters for natural earthquake faults are given as @xmath73 [ s ] , @xmath74 a few [ cm ] , and @xmath75 .",
    "this yields @xmath76 , @xmath68 around @xmath77 while @xmath69 and @xmath70 being one or two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "the crossover velocity @xmath37 and its dimensionless counterpart @xmath19 is hard to estimate though it should be much smaller than unity , and we take it as a parameter in our simulations .",
    "the continuum limit of the bk model corresponds to making the dimensionless block size @xmath17 , defined by @xmath78 , to be infinitesimal @xmath79 , simultaneously making the system infinitely rigid @xmath80 with @xmath81 @xcite .",

    "note that the term @xmath91 representing the plate drive is absent in the standard elasto - dynamic equation .",

    "in fact , we find that the slow and reversible nucleaton process corresponding to the initial phase is realized only in the `` weak frictional instability '' regime where the frictional - weakening parameter @xmath70 is smaller than a critical value @xmath112 , while , in the `` strong frictional instability '' regime where the frictional - weakening parameter @xmath70 is greater than a critical value @xmath112 , the nucleation process does not accompany the slow and reversible initial phase . a typical example of seismic events in the strong frictional instability regime",

    "the period of oscillation should be given by @xmath177 , which , in the example of fig.12 , yields 0.5 .",
    "this period is expected to be independent of the parameters like the plate loading velocity @xmath118 or the crossover velocity @xmath19 , while it might increase weakly with the frictional parameter @xmath70 because of the slowing - down effect due to the friction . because of the friction , the velocity of the subsequent rupture - front propagation tends to be reduced , making the oscillation period a bit longer at a later time .",

    "we find from our numerical simulations that , in the steady state of an earthquake sequence , the excess stress @xmath236 , which is defined as the elastic - force difference at a given block between the initial value at the beginning of the nucleation process and the threshold value at which that block eventually begins to move involved into the nucleation process , is more or less constant over blocks involved in a given event , even though this quantity is scattered considerably over various events in an event sequence .",
    "this feature originates from the fact the stress distribution after a large event tends to be flat over blocks involved in this event .",
    "equivalently , the threshold displacement @xmath237 , which is defined as the displacement that the block located at the rim of the nucleus exhibits in order for the neighboring block initially at rest begins to move , also turns out to be more or less constant over blocks .",

    "the duration times @xmath340 and @xmath345 turn out to depend on the friction parameter @xmath19 .",
    "th friction crossover velocity @xmath19 is introduced in our analysis to describe the state at rest phenomenologically . in view of such a slow speed of the plate drive @xmath376 [ nm / sec ] , being of `` atomic '' scale , the question of whether the stuck region of the fault is completely stuck with a zero sliding velocity , or it is moving with a speed much lower than @xmath118 , sounds too `` academic '' . in describing a macroscopic earthquake phenomenon",
    ", it would perhaps be more realistic to regard the stuck state as being completely at rest with @xmath377 , and modify the relevant friction law so that it can describe the state at rest .",
    "remember that the standard @xmath69-term proportional to @xmath378 gives an infinitely negative friction for @xmath379 , and does not allow anything to stop whatsoever .",
    "in other words , we feel that considering the `` stuck '' state as a state with its sliding velocity @xmath380 is not much meaningful .",
    "then , in order to describe such a state at complete rest @xmath377 , we need a modified @xmath69-term with a nonzero crossover velocity @xmath19 ( @xmath381 ) , as was done phenomenologically here .    to predict the size of an earthquake would be even more difficult . any quantity related to the nucleation process studied here , including the nucleation lengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 and various duration times of the nucleation process , has no pronounced correlation with the size of an ensuing mainshock , at least for larger ones . _",
    "the problem of how big a mainshock is going to be is related to the stress state of the entire area , not limited to the nucleus area_. just the information of the nucleus area is not enough to predict the ensuing mainshock size .",
    "if so , a wide - area survey of the stress state would be necessary for the detection of the mainshock size .",
    "finally , we wish to discuss possible extensions of our present analysis .",
    "first , as the present model is one - dimensional , an obvious extension is to study the properties of the corresponding two - dimensional model . in two dimensions ,",
    "the geometry could be more complex than in one dimension , which might modify at least a part of the results obtained here for the one - dimensional model .",
    "second , in the present model , the nearest - neighbor interaction has been assumed between blocks . in real earthquake faults ,",
    "the existence of the crust perpendicular to the fault plane mediates the long - range interaction even between blocks away on the fault plane .",
    "in fact , the long - range interaction has been employed in the elastic - continuum analysis @xcite . even within the discrete bk model ,",
    "the effects of the elastic long - range interaction was investigated , mainly concerning with its statistical properties such as the magnitude distribution @xcite . it would be desirable to study the nature of the nucleation process of such a long - range bk model , and compare it with that of the short - range model studied here .",
    "third , the present model is homogeneous except for its intrinsic discreteness in the form of blocks .",
    "real faults are more inhomogeneous where the elastic and the frictional parameters exhibit inhomogeneous distribution .",
    "the form of such a spatial inhomogeneity might be either random or more organized as being hierarchical @xcite . within the bk model",
    ", it is possible to take account of such an inhomogeneity by assuming the model parameters varying from block to block @xcite .",
    "fourth , the effects of the viscosity or the relaxation were not taken into account in the present model .",
    "such relaxation effects should more or less exist in real faults .",
    "it would also be desirable to clarify its role not only in the earthquake nucleation process but also in the mainshock itself .",
    "we leave these extensions and open problems to a future task .    in summary",
    ", we studied the properties of the earthquake nucleation process of a mature fault both numerically and analytically on the basis of the spring - block bk model obeying the rsf law .",
    "we find that this simplified model successfully reproduces various features of the expected earthquake nucleation process .",
    "we analyzed the dynamical properties of the model at each stage of the nucleation process in detail , including their continuum limits , and further discussed the connection to a possible earthquake forecast .",
