    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze , @xcite ) , inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons off hot electrons , offers a powerful probe of cosmic plasma up to high redshifts ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the surface brightness of the sze is independent of the source redshift @xmath3 for given electron density @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 and is proportional to @xmath6 , whereas that of x - rays varies as @xmath7 with only weak dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "the sze can hence be a unique tool for studying the physics of the intracluster medium , e.g. , by detecting shocks ( pressure gaps ) and very hot gas associated with subcluster mergers @xcite .",
    "the advent of large - area surveys by the south pole telescope ( spt ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the planck satellite ( e.g. , @xcite ) has enhanced the sample of galaxy clusters observed via the sze by more than an order of magnitude over the past decade .",
    "the caveats of existing observations are limited angular resolution ( @xmath8 in the above mentioned surveys ) and sensitivity .",
    "single - dish measurements by the mustang bolometer array have achieved currently the highest angular resolution of @xmath9 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) for the sze maps ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while they are still challenged by point source and atmospheric contamination .",
    "interferometers offer a complementary tool with good control of systematic noise and capability of separating compact sources from the sze , albeit reduced sensitivity for the sources more extended than the baseline coverage ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a recent sze map obtained by carma has a synthesized beam with @xmath10 @xcite .    with a combination of 7-m and 12-m arrays in band 3 , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma )",
    "serves as the first instrument to resolve the sze with an angular resolution of @xmath11 , as predicted by detailed imaging simulations @xcite using hydrodynamic simulation data @xcite . among currently available frequency bands of alma ,",
    "band 3 is the most suitable for the sze imaging owing to the largest field - of - view , the lowest system temperature , and minimal contamination by synchrotron and dust emission . given that the total power array is still unavailable for continuum observations by alma , viable targets are limited to compact distant galaxy clusters .",
    "in this paper , we present the first measurement of the sze by alma .",
    "the target is a galaxy cluster rx j1347.51145 at @xmath12 . owing to its brightness and compactness , rx j1347.51145 is a prime target for imaging observations by the current configuration of alma .",
    "a number of sze measurements have been made for this cluster in the past @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nobeyama bolometer array ( noba ; @xcite ) detected a prominent substructure that was not expected from regular morphology of this cluster in the soft - band x - ray image by rosat @xcite .",
    "the presence of the substructure was confirmed with subsequent x - ray data by chandra @xcite and xmm - newton @xcite as well as sze maps by mustang @xcite , carma @xcite , and nika @xcite .",
    "the inferred temperature of the substructure exceeds 20 kev and is appreciably higher than the mean temperature of the cluster @xmath13 kev @xcite ; this accounts for the fact that the substructure was more obvious in the sze map than the x - ray surface brightness image .",
    "the disturbed feature was also observed by the radio synchrotron observations @xcite and gravitational lensing maps ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these previous results indicate that the cluster is undergoing a merger , but its exact nature such as geometry and dynamics of the collision is still unclear @xcite .",
    "the alma band 3 observation of rx j1347.51145 is crucial not only for better understanding this particular galaxy cluster but also for testing the capability of alma in observing the sze against a range of independent datasets available for this well - studied system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec - obs ] describes the observations and calibration .",
    "section [ sec - image ] presents details of the imaging analysis including point source subtraction and deconvolution .",
    "the results are validated against the x - ray data , realistic imaging simulations , and previous high - significance sze measurements in section [ sec - implication ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec - conc ] . throughout the paper , we adopt a standard set of cosmological density parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we use the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath16 ; given controversial results on the value of @xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we do not fix it unless stated otherwise . in this cosmology ,",

    "this is approximately the nyquist spacing for the 12-m array and achieves much denser sampling for the 7-m array .",
    "calibration of the raw visibility data taken with the 12-m array was performed using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ; @xcite ) program version 4.3.1 as implemented in a standard reduction script for alma cycle 2 data .",
    "the data taken with the 7-m array were calibrated by the alma pipeline using the casa version 4.2.2 .",
    "we use the data produced from the second stage of alma s quality assurance process ( qa2 ) for both the 12-m array and the 7-m array .",
    "a quasar j13371257 was monitored in all the execution blocks ; it is used as a phase calibrator as well as a bandpass calibrator throughout this project . several solar system objects ( mars , callisto , ceres , and ganymede ;",
    "see table [ tab - obs ] ) were chosen by the observatory as primary flux calibrators , although the data of ceres were not used in the end for the reason described below .",
    "we used these calibrators to determine the flux density of j13371257 , which was then used to compare the flux scales of different execution blocks .",
    "the butler - jpl - horizons-2012 model ( butler 2012 ) was used for determining the absolute flux density of solar system objects .",
    "the absolute flux densities of j13371257 in eb7 - 5 , eb7 - 7 , eb12 - 3 , and eb12 - 4 were determined from measurements of the solar system objects by the observatory on 2014 - 12 - 07 , 2014 - 12 - 18 , and 2015 - 01 - 17 , available in the alma calibrator source catalogue .",
    "given that the catalogued measurements were more than 10 days away from eb12 - 3 and eb12 - 4 , we additionally checked that the flux scales of eb12 - 3 and eb12 - 4 were consistent with three calibration measurements of j13371257 in band 3 executed on 2015 - 01 - 06 , the closest in time available in the alma archive , using ganymede , pallas , and j1427421 as flux calibrators ( project codes : 2013.1.00120.s and 2013.1.01312.s ) .",
    "flux equalization was applied during qa2 to some of the execution blocks close in time .",
    "observations in august , 2014 ( eb7 - 1 , eb7 - 2 , eb7 - 3 , and eb7 - 4 ) were performed within 27 hours and scaled together using the mean of the absolute flux scales from the four execution blocks . for eb7 - 8 and",

    "the variance of the j13371257 flux density listed in table [ tab - obs ] is much larger than the errors quoted in individual execution blocks , suggesting the presence of underlying systematics of the absolute flux scale as well as potential time variability of j13371257 itself . for 11 execution blocks excluding eb7 - 9 and eb12 - 2",
    "( for which the flux scale was replaced with those of other execution blocks as mentioned above ) , the standard deviation of the j13371257 flux density at 92  ghz relative to the mean is @xmath31 . if we separate the data taken in august , 2014 , and the others , it is @xmath32 , and @xmath31 , respectively , in each data set . if we separate the data taken by the 7-m array and the 12-m array , it is @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively . finally , in each of the four spectral windows for the 11 execution blocks , it is @xmath35 at 85 , 87 , 97 , 99 ghz , respectively .",

    "this cutoff @xmath24 distance was chosen to fully separate the compact source from the extended signal beyond @xmath51 as well as to retain an ample signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the source is consistent with a point source if an image was created from visibilities above this cutoff .",
    "given simplicity of the source shape , we fitted a point source model to the @xmath24 data from the central pointing ( without mosaicing ) varying both the flux density and the position . to examine the spectrum of the source",
    ", we performed the fit separately in 84 - 88 ghz and 96 - 100 ghz , i.e. , in upper and lower two spectral windows .",
    "fitting the data in eb12 - 1 , eb12 - 2 , eb12 - 3 , and eb12 - 4 simultaneously , we find @xmath52 mjy and @xmath53 mjy at the central frequencies of 86 ghz and 98 ghz , respectively .",
    "the first errors are statistical and the second ones are systematic errors from the flux calibration . the best - fit source position is ( , ) at both frequencies with a statistical error of less than @xmath54 .",
    "the spectral index of the source inferred from the two measurements over a narrow range between 86 ghz and 98 ghz is @xmath55 .",
    "if the fit is performed for smaller spectral bins , the flux density changes only within the statistical errors .",
    "this is also consistent with the spectral index inferred above ; the flux density is expected to change by less than about @xmath56 over the frequency difference of @xmath57  ghz in our observing band .",
    "we hence did not subdivide the frequency bins further .",
    "the best - fit point source models described above were subtracted from the visibility data taken by the 12-m array and the 7-m array , separately in each of the spectral windows covering 8488 ghz and 96100 ghz .    when we fit each of eb12 - 1 , eb12 - 2 , eb12 - 3 , and eb12 - 4 separately , we find that the best - fit flux of the central agn varies around the above mentioned values by @xmath58 and @xmath59 at 86 ghz and 98 ghz , respectively , whereas the statistical errors are about @xmath60 .",
    "the variation is correlated with that of the j13371257 flux listed in table [ tab - obs ] ; the linear correlation coefficients are 0.993 and 0.999 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that systematic uncertainty of the central agn flux is indeed dominated by the calibration error .    to test consistency of the normalization of the 7-m and 12-m array data , we fitted a point source model to the visibilities taken by the 7-m array between 7 and 16 k@xmath26 , the longest @xmath24 distances covered by this array .",
    "given poorer statistics of the 7-m array data , all the spectral windows between 84 ghz and 100 ghz are fitted together fixing the source coordinate at the best - fit position from the 12-m array data . from the data in all the execution blocks for the 7-m array ,",
    "the fitted value of the agn flux density is @xmath61 mjy . if we separate the data taken in 2014 august and 2014 december , they are @xmath62 mjy and @xmath63 mjy , respectively .",
    "statistical errors are too large to examine a correlation with the j13371257 flux density for the 7-m array . for comparison , a similar fit to the 12-m array data between 7 and 16 k@xmath26 yields @xmath64 mjy .",
    "the flux values measured by the two arrays are thus consistent within the statistical and calibration errors .",
    "in addition to the calibration error of @xmath36 on the total sze flux , the intensity of the source - subtracted map is subject to a position - dependent error from the adopted source flux . at the subtracted source position ,",
    "this error is estimated to be at most @xmath65 of the source flux ( @xmath66mjy ) , i.e. , @xmath67 mjy / beam , after the data from 4 and 9 execution blocks are combined for the 12-m array and the 7-m array , respectively .",
    "the error becomes smaller than the noise level of 0.012 mjy / beam at @xmath68 away from the source for an average beam fwhm of @xmath69 in the present case .",
    "note that the flux density of the central agn measured by alma in 2014 december and 2015 january are lower than @xmath70 mjy measured by the 23 element array of carma in 2011 february at the central frequency of 86  ghz @xcite ; the fitted source position is in good agreement with that of carma .",
    "a part of the difference may be ascribed to a long - term variability of the agn over nearly four - year period as well as to calibration between alma and carma . even if we further allow for an additional bias of + 1  mjy for the central source flux , the biased intensity in the source - subtracted map drops below the noise level at @xmath71 away from the source .",
    "we hence conclude that the flux calibration error hardly affects _ morphology _ of the source - subtracted map except in the vicinity of the source position .",
    "still , its impact on the total flux should be treated with care .",
    "there is another known radio source in the field of rx j1347.51145 at ( , ) with the 1.4 ghz flux density of @xmath72 mjy measured by vla @xcite and the 350 ghz flux density of @xmath73 mjy measured by scuba @xcite .",
    "this source is located at @xmath74 away from the central agn ( a circle in figure [ fig - dirty1 ] ) .",
    "being at the map edge , this source is not clearly detected in the present alma data while there is a hint of a positive signal at about the @xmath75 statistical significance .",
    "the 92  ghz flux density measured within the diameter of @xmath29 around the reported vla position is @xmath76 mjy .",
    "we do not subtract this source and simply exclude its position from the analysis presented in this paper .      to correct for incomplete sampling of the visibility data , we performed image deconvolution using the multi - scale clean algorithm implemented in casa .",
    "this method models an image by a sum of gaussians of various sizes and is shown to recover much higher fraction of flux for extended sources than the conventional clean algorithm @xcite .",
    "it also has an advantage over the maximum entropy method ( e.g. , @xcite ) in that it is free from the positivity constraint .",
    "there are some free parameters in multi - scale clean , such as the sizes of gaussian components used for deconvolution and the scale bias parameter by which residuals at different scales are weighted @xcite .",
    "optimal choices of these parameters depend on the target and the instrument in consideration . having searched for a combination of parameters that gives minimal residuals as well as the maximal recovered flux , we adopt the scales [ @xmath77 with the small - scale bias parameter of 0.4 as our fiducial choice .",
    "the scale @xmath78 corresponds to the size of a synthesized beam , i.e. , the scale used in the conventional ( single - scale ) clean algorithm .",
    "we also use a loop gain of 0.05 suitable for diffuse emission and a flux threshold of 0.03 mjy ( @xmath79 ) ; the flux threshold is reached by less than 10,000 iterations in all the cases presented in this paper .    , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83",

    "the plotted residual is the rms value measured on a residual map after being corrected for primary beam attenuation and smoothed with a gaussian kernel to a fixed resolution of @xmath84 fwhm .",
    "both flux and residuals are measured within a diameter of @xmath49 around the field center . , width=340 ]    figure [ fig - scale ] illustrates how the recovered flux and residuals change as we successively add a larger scale in the deconvolution . to examine the sensitivity to an extended signal ,",
    "the residual maps are smoothed by a gaussian kernel to a resolution of 15@xmath18 fwhm and the rms values within a diameter of @xmath49 around the field center are plotted .",
    "they are compared with the flux within the same region of the deconvolved image",
    ". converged results are obtained by taking the largest scale to be between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , corresponding to the maximum recoverable scale for the shortest baseline length of 2.1 k@xmath26 in the present data .",
    "we have also checked that the deconvolved results are insensitive to the value of the small - scale bias parameter as long as its value is less than 0.8 .    while the above procedure gives robust reconstruction of the observed signal up to a spatial scale of @xmath87 , flux at larger scale is still lost in currently available alma data with no total power measurements . in what follows ,",
    "we focus on the results that can be derived solely at @xmath88 and discuss separately the degree of missing flux by means of simulations in section [ sec - sim ] .",

    "it is also evident that eliminating the point source contamination is crucial for recovering detailed structures of the sze .",
    "the position of the south - east peak in the source - added and smoothed maps ( panels b and d ) is offset by @xmath185 compared to that identified in the unsmoothed alma map ( figure [ fig - sz ] ) .",
    "the eastern ridge ( the feature labeled as 2 in figure 5 of @xcite ) is weaker than reported by @xcite in both alma and updated mustang maps . in accord with @xcite , a low significance decrement peak in the south - west quadrant of this cluster seen in the noba map (",
    "the feature labeled as 3 in figure 5 of @xcite ) is absent in the alma map as well .    with respect to the positions marked by the dashed circles in figure [ fig - compsz ] , the peak intensities of the decrement in the source - added and smoothed alma maps shown in figures [ fig - compsz](b)(d ) are @xmath186 mjy / beam and @xmath187 mjy / beam , respectively ( the latter is a converted value at 150  ghz ) ; quoted systematic errors are from the missing flux correction and the flux calibration .",
    "these intensities are consistent with the corresponding values measured on the mustang map of @xmath188 mjy / beam ( with the @xmath133 statistical error of @xmath189 mjy / beam ) and on the noba map of @xmath190 mjy / beam , respectively , within the range of uncertainties in each measurement .",

    "the accuracy of the map is limited primarily by missing flux arising from the lack of short - spacing data in the current configuration of alma .",
    "we have presented detailed analysis procedures including corrections for the missing flux based on realistic imaging simulations for rx  j1347.51145 .",
