    "when a metal enters its superconducting state , optical spectral weight is lost at finite frequencies under the real part of the optical conductivity , @xmath2.@xcite provided the change in kinetic energy between normal and superconducting state is small and can be neglected , the missing spectral weight reappears as a contribution at zero frequency which originates in the superfluid , and the over all optical sum rule of ferrell , glover , and tinkham remains unchanged .",
    "the distribution in frequency of the remaining spectral weight under @xmath3 @xmath4 depends on gap symmetry , on the nature of the inelastic scattering involved , on the concentration and scattering strength of the impurities , and on temperature.@xcite in this paper we consider explicitely the case of @xmath0-wave gap symmetry within a generalized eliashberg formalism.@xcite in this approach the optical conductivity ( as well as the quasiparticle spectral density ) contains an incoherent part associated with boson assisted absorption which is not centered about zero frequency and which contributes to the optical spectral weight in the infrared range . in addition",
    "there is the usual quasiparticle contribution of bcs theory .",
    "alternate approaches to include inelastic scattering exist . in several works ,",
    "the quasiparticle scattering rate due to coupling to spin fluctuations is simply added to a bcs formalism through an additional scattering channel.@xcite nevertheless , whenever we refer to bcs within this paper we mean the standard theory without these additional features .    in bcs theory",
    "the london penetration depth@xcite at zero temperature @xmath5 $ ] in the clean limit is given by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the free electron density , @xmath8 is the charge on the electron , @xmath9 is its mass , @xmath10 is the plasma frequency , and we have set the velocity of light equal to 1 ) and all the optical spectral weight condenses .",
    "however , as the impurity mean free path is reduced , not all the spectral weight is transferred to the condensate@xcite and there remains some residual impurity induced absorption.@xcite details depend on gap symmetry .    in eliashberg theory",
    "the pairing interaction is described by an electron - phonon spectral density , denoted by @xmath11.@xcite twice the first inverse moment of @xmath11 , gives the quasiparticle mass renormalization with the effective @xmath12 to bare @xmath13 mass ratio @xmath14 . while the gap and renormalization function of eliashberg theory acquire a frequency dependence which requires numerical treatment , a useful ,",
    "although not exact , approximation is to assume that the important frequencies in @xmath11 are much higher than the superconducting energy scale and , thus , one can approximate the renormalizations by a constant @xmath15 value.@xcite in this approximation , the zero temperature penetration depth is @xmath16 $ ] in the clean limit .",
    "thus , the electron - phonon renormalization simply changes the bare mass in the london expression to the renormalized mass @xmath17 .",
    "this result does not depend explicitly on the gap and holds independent of its symmetry .",
    "a naive interpretation of this result is that only the coherent quasiparticle part of the electron - spectral density [ which contains approximately @xmath18 of the total spectral weight of one ] condenses .",
    "while this is approximately true , we will see that the incoherent part which contains the remaining @xmath19 part of the spectral weight is also involved , although in a more minor and subtle way .    in an @xmath20-wave superconductor the entire incoherent part of the conductivity",
    "is shifted upward by twice the gap value , @xmath21 , when compared to its normal state .",
    "it is also slightly distorted but , to a good approximation , it remains unchanged .",
    "the fact that there is a @xmath22 shift between normal and superconducting state implies that an optical spectral weight shift originates from this contribution even if its overall contribution to the sum rule should remain the same . for a @xmath0-wave superconductor",
    "the situation is more complex because the gap is anisotropic and , thus , the shift by @xmath23 varies with the polar angle @xmath24 on the two - dimensional fermi surface of the cuo@xmath25 planes .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand , within an eliashberg formalism , how the remaining area under the real part of the optical conductivity is distributed in frequency , how this distribution is changed by finite temperature effects and by the introduction of elastic impurity scattering , and what information can be obtained from such studies about the superconducting state and the nature of the mechanism which drives it .    in reference to @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the cuprates two boson exchange models which have received much attention are the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( naffl ) model@xcite and the marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) model.@xcite",
    "both models are characterized by an appropriate charge carrier - exchange boson spectral density @xmath26 which replaces the @xmath11 of the phonon case@xcite and which reflects the nature of the inelastic scattering envisioned . in the naffl model",
    "a further complication arises in that we would expect @xmath26 to be very anisotropic as a function of momentum on the fermi surface . for simplicity",

    "the electron spectral function still has a @xmath114-function part broadened by the interactions at any finite energy away from the fermi energy but the amount of weight under this part is @xmath18 , where @xmath15 is the mass enhancement parameter for the electron - boson exchange interaction .",
    "the remaining spectral weight @xmath19 is to be found in incoherent , boson assisted tails .",

    "the incoherent , boson assisted tails in @xmath2 do not contribute much to the condensate and in fact remain pretty well unaffected in shape and optical weight by the transition to the superconducting state but they are shifted upwards due to the opening up of the superconducting gap .",
    "this shift implies that when one considers the missing optical spectral weight under the conductivity which enters the condensate , the energy scale for this readjustment is not set by the gap scale but rather by the scale of the maximum exchanged boson energy .",

    "<S> the distribution in frequency of optical spectral weight remaining under the real part of the optical conductivity in the superconducting state of a @xmath0-wave superconductor depends on impurity concentration , on the strength of the impurity potential as well as on temperature and there is some residual absorption even at @xmath1 . in bcs theory </S>",
    "<S> the important weight is confined to the microwave region if the scattering is sufficiently weak . in an eliashberg formulation substantial additional weight </S>",
    "<S> is to be found in the incoherent , boson assisted background which falls in the infrared and is not significantly depleted by the formation of the condensate , although it is shifted as a result of the opening of a superconducting gap . </S>"
