    "mankind is familiar with various phases of matter and transitions between the phases from antiquity .",
    "for example , ice - water - steam ; ice is solid that exhibit characteristic rigidity , water is liquid and it flows like other liquids , and steam is a gas , much like other gases .",
    "it is only in the 19th century that with the advent of the science of thermodynamics the phases of matter and their transformations were rationalized within the scientific domain .",
    "the phase transition of water to steam gave birth to the great discovery of the steam engine by thomas newcomen in 1712 , and it resulted in the subsequent great industrial revolution first in britain and then in europe .",
    "it is beyond doubt that man is able to use , for the service of humanity , the great practical potential of the fundamental understanding of the materials and their transformations .",
    "aim of the the present paper is to give a broad overview of the phase transition phenomena from fundamental perspective starting from early works of andrews and van der waals .",
    "the mean - field theories ( mfts ) were developed to understand thermodynamical phase transitions from atomic / molecular perspective , and van der waals was the pioneer in this@xcite .",
    "we discuss various mean - field theories ( mfts ) and their reformulation by lev landau in 1937@xcite .",
    "mfts are good qualitative descriptors of the phase transition behavior .",
    "but all mean - field theories fail at the critical point including the landau s formulation . at",
    "the critical point correlation length ( defined precisely in the text ) diverges and fluctuations dominate over the average behavior .",
    "it is this failure of the mfts that triggered further investigations that resulted the formulation of renormalization group by wilson and others in 1970s@xcite .",
    "the problems with large correlation length in quantum many - body systems are the hardest problems known in theoretical physics ( both in condensed matter and in particle physics ) and this branch of physics is far from being closed .",
    "the present paper is a pedagogical introduction to this vast but coherent topic .",
    "the story of the successes and failures of mfts and their systematic replacement at the critical point by the renormalization group theory is given in a clear and pedagogical way .",
    "we also address , more specifically , the following questions : why does non - analyticity ( sharp phase transitions ) arise when thermodynamical functions ( i.e. , free energies etc ) are good analytic functions ?",
    "how does landau s program unify all the previous mean - field theories ?",
    "why do all the mean - field theories fail near the critical point ?",
    "how does wilson s program go beyond all the mean - field theories ?",
    "what is origin emergence and universality ?",
    "the answers of above questions are well known@xcite .",
    "presentation here is sufficiently self - contained to address the above questions .",
    "_ thus it will be useful to the students learning the subject .",
    "_ we also express our standpoint regarding the failure of mfts , and point out that mfts faithfully reproduce diverging fluctuations at the critical point and divergence of fluctuations can be understood most clearly by recognizing the fact that the property of statistical independence ( si ) is violated in systems with long correlation length ( when various parts of the system become statistically correlated)@xcite .",
    "and the fundamental thesis of boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics  fluctuations converge as @xmath0 in sum - function observables@xcite  is no longer applicable in systems with large correlation length ( of the order of the system s size ) making the fluctuations to dominate over the average behavior .",
    "the reason why mfts predict wrong values of critical indices is given in@xcite , that also clarifies a common misconception .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next subsection",
    "we give some examples of phase transitions .",
    "the next section ( section 2 ) is devoted to ehrenfest s classification and to some mean - field theories",
    ". then in section 3 we present landau s formulation of mfts .",
    "section 4 deals with the problems of mfts . after recognizing the difficulties when dealing with problems with long correlation length we present kadanoff s construction and wilson s renormalization group ( rg ) formulation that rectify the problems of mfts ( section 5 ) .",
    "this is illustrated by a specific example of @xmath1-theory .",
    "although there are many different formulations of renormalization group method and has been applied to many different problems@xcite , our point here is to present the essence of the method for pedagogical purposes . in section 6",
    "we also address the important question : why do all the mean - field theories fail near the critical point and how does wilson s program go beyond mfts ?",
    "a short biographical sketch of ken wilson is given in the appendix .",
    "phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature !",
    "most common phase transition is that of water and ice ( figure 1(a ) ) .",
    "we see this when we put liquid water in the refrigerator for making ice , a common experience . we know that to make ice from water we need to extract some heat for a given mass of water .",
    "this is called the latent heat and for water it is @xmath2 .",
    "thus to make ice from water you have to extract this much amount of heat per gram from water ( i.e. , by cooling it ) and to convert back water from ice you have to supply that amount ( i.e. , by heating the ice )",
    ". you also note that when you cool water to convert it into ice , it expands , i.e. , the volume of ice for a given mass of water is more than the volume of liquid water of that mass , or ice floats on water .",
    "these facts can be quantitatively described by introducing the thermodynamical free energy@xcite .",
    "discontinuity of its first order derivatives with respect to thermodynamical parameters leads to above discontinuities .",
    "we will explain this in the section devoted to ehrenfest s classification .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     these are the coupled algebraic equations .",
    "one can make analogy to the equation @xmath3 that we derived by using kadanoff s real space blocking method .",
    "here calculation is done in momentum space . by invoking the same logic",
    "that at the critical point the function @xmath4 becomes scale independent due to the divergence of correlation length .",
    "this divergence of correlation length leads to fixed point solution ( as we learn in kadanoff s method in last subsection ) .",
    "thus self - consistent solution of the above contains the physics of the critical point .",
    "one can obtain the self consistent solution by iterative procedure i.e. , by evolving the above equations as a recursive procedure .",
    "this iterative procedure can be depicted by the following diagram ( figure  [ iter](a ) ) .",
    "let us express the equations after nth iteration as @xmath5 @xmath6 after sufficient number of iterations one will end up at the critical point @xmath7 . for illustration consider the case of @xmath8 ( figure [ iter](a ) ) .",
    "the two curves ( one for @xmath9 and other for @xmath10 ) meet at point @xmath11 .",
    "if one starts with some initial value @xmath12 ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 , does not matter ) one will end up , after sufficient number of iteration , at @xmath11 .    _",
    "the great advantage of the wilson s formulation is that we are able to know the required function explicitly . _",
    "the other important point is that the critical fixed point @xmath15 does not depend on the initial parameters in the hamiltonian i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "_ thus the critical point behavior does not depend on the microscopic details of the system .",
    "this is called the universality .",
    "for example , @xmath17 both for the magnetic systems and for the liquid gas transitions!(see for details @xcite ) .",
    "_    this how wilson changed kadanoff s qualitative ideas into a powerful computational procedure , as we know today , rg has been applied to wide variety of problems . here by considering one example we have covered the basics of the method .",
    "one can also compute the critical indices .",
    "let us take one example of the calculation of @xmath18 .",
    "for this we need to linearize the fixed point equations . for @xmath19",
    "very near to @xmath20 ( say curves 2 , or 3 in figure  [ iter](b ) ) : @xmath21 @xmath22 as @xmath23 is a function of temperature through @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is also a function of temperature .",
    "thus these can be taylor expanded for @xmath19 near @xmath20 . for very large @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xmath28 or @xmath29 @xmath30    for @xmath19 sufficiently close to @xmath20 . as @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( our fixed point equations )",
    ", the temperature derivatives can again be taylor expanded around the fixed point .",
    "this leads to : @xmath33 @xmath34 as the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are known one can work out the expansion coefficients explicitly ( see for details wilson - kogut in @xcite ) : @xmath37 by iterating @xmath38times : @xmath39 the purpose of iterating @xmath40-times is that the matrix @xmath41 is completely dominated by the largest eigenvalue @xmath42 ( @xmath43 for @xmath44 case ) .",
    "one can find eigensystem of the above matrix and finally ( as the largest eigenvalue dominates ! ) : @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the largest eigen value , @xmath47 is the corresponding eigenvector , and @xmath48 is a constant ( see for details wilson - kogut in@xcite ) .",
    "and a similar expression holds for the @xmath49 .",
    "one observe that : @xmath50 thus the correlation length : @xmath51 now @xmath52 if correlation length scales as : @xmath53 then from above : @xmath54 if @xmath44 ( simple gaussian model ) , then @xmath55 which leads to @xmath56 ( the mft result ) . with explicit calculation of @xmath46 for @xmath57 ( see for details wilson - kogut in@xcite ) , @xmath18 comes out to be : @xmath58 this is very close to the experimentally observed value @xmath59 ( in mft it is @xmath60 ! ! ! ! ) .",
    "similarly other critical indices can be calculated and are quite close to what is observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "thus , by exploiting scale invariance at the critical point and by finding the critical point from fixed point equations by iterative procedure one is able to calculated correct values of critical indices .",
    "the important point that goes implicit in the above statement is that iterative procedure is not only a mathematical device to reach to the fixed point but also at each step of iteration one is averaging over smaller length scale ( or higher momentum scale ) fluctuations and with this appropriate averaging over increasingly longer length scales one is able calculate the correct values of critical indices . with this sophistication of",
    "renormalization group method we immediately see the drawback of mfts . in mfts we do an abrupt step in dealing with the fluctuations : @xmath61 i.e. , we average out only the smaller length scale ( of the order of lattice constant ) fluctuations ( in calculating the effective field seen by the test spin ) . near the critical point just below the critical temperature , ensemble averages over smaller length scales ( of the order of lattice constant ) lead to zero value of the order parameter ( here mean magnetization ) .",
    "only when one averages over a large length scale ( of the order of correlation length ) can one see some tiny magnetization just below criticality .",
    "thus our assumption of tiny mean magnetization over a smaller length scale ( of the order of lattice constant ) in mft breaks down ! and",
    "mft predicts wrong values of critical indices ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "ken wilson earned his ph.d . from the california institute of technology ( caltech ) in 1961 , studying under murray gell - maan . elementary particle physics ( now called high energy physics ) was a fashionable subject in those days ( today also it is one of the mainstream topics along with condensed matter physics ) and students would like to opt for it . but wilson rebelled , and worked for a while on plasma physics .",
    "something that did not go very well@xcite . during that time he used to discuss his problems with s. chandrasekhar ( cousin of sir c. v. raman ) . here is an interesting story@xcite :    his father had told him : when you go to caltech , be sure to meet the two great physicists there namely , feynman and gell - mann. k. wilson says that when he called on feynman , the latter seemed to be gazing at the ceiling .",
    "he asked feynman , professor , what are you working on at present? feynman replied , nothing !",
    "wilson then went to gell - mann and became his student ! ! !",
    "he worked on the solutions of gell - mann and low equation @xmath62 and on fixed - source meson theory for his phd thesis . around 1963",
    "he read onsager s paper and became interested in critical phenomena , and after that studying other works on critical phenomena he developed the renormalization group theory , using tricks and techniques that he had learnt in particle physics .",
