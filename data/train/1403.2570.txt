    "the z(2 ) symmetric quantum field theory of a single scalar field with @xmath0 interaction is the number one textbook prototype model for all kinds of field theoretic methods . at the same time , with its possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking , it may be viewed as the crudest caricature of the higgs sector of the standard model . in this context the strongly conjectured triviality of the model in four space time dimensions is of physical interest as it leads to upper bounds on the higgs mass .",
    "this is so because triviality means that the cutoff can not be removed from the regularized theory without ending in a free gaussian theory .",
    "the model is then interpreted as an effective theory in which an upper limit on tolerable unphysical cutoff effects implies an upper bound on the interaction strength which in turn is responsible for mass generation by the higgs field .",
    "unfortunately in the four dimensional case , we still have to rely on numerical methods to demonstrate triviality beyond the perturbative regime .",
    "such studies in the lattice regularization have been strongly boosted by a series of papers by lscher and weisz ( lw ) , of which the first two have dealt with the one component model in the symmetric @xcite and in the broken @xcite phase . here",
    "control over the lattice theory was gained by combining large orders in the hopping parameter expansion with careful perturbative renormalization group evolution.@xcite these studies were in addition corroborated by some early monte carlo simulations as for example @xcite , @xcite . in these cases",
    "the ising model was considered as the limit of @xmath0 theory at infinite bare coupling . barring a complicated non - monotonic relation between bare and ( natural ) renormalized couplings on the lattice , this limit is the most interesting case for questions concerning triviality .    in recent years one of the authors",
    "has taken up the subject again after some progress had been made in monte carlo methods which allow to achieve a new level of precision in this context with only moderate investments in compute power .",
    "the main new ingredients are on the one hand the use of so - called worm algorithms @xcite , @xcite to simulate arbitrary order contributions of a hopping parameter expansion for observables on finite lattices instead of generating field configurations .",
    "the second ingredient is the use of finite volume renormalization schemes as in @xcite . as triviality is an ultraviolet renormalization effect , more compute power",
    "can be devoted in this way to closely approaching the continuum limit as the thermodynamic limit does not have to be taken .",
    "in other words , the manageable ratios @xmath1 between lattice size and spacing is used to achieve a significant range of small @xmath2 and not for large @xmath3 in physical units . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    "such a strategy has been explored for the symmetric phase of the model . in this publication",
    "we now offer a finite size scaling study on the other side of the critical line .    in section 2 .",
    "we define our renormalization scheme , followed by basic definitions of @xmath0 theory . in section 4 . the numerical method and achieved results",
    "are described followed by a brief summary .",
    "this work is based on the master thesis of the first author at humboldt university , berlin 2013 .",
    "at first glance the title of this subsection might look paradoxical as there is no symmetry breaking in a finite volume .",
    "if we define however an order parameter @xmath4 by the large distance behavior of the z(2 ) symmetric fundamental two point correlation ( @xmath5 is the correlation length ) , @xmath6 then this definition has a smooth thermodynamic limit . to define definite renormalization conditions we employ the fourier transform @xmath7 and extract @xmath8 from @xmath9 where we have assumed a torus of extent @xmath3 in each direction and @xmath10 is the varying part of the correlation ( ` connected ' , although we here avoid the one - point function ) .",
    "we now complete our renormalization scheme by singling out two small torus momenta @xmath11 beside zero momentum .",
    "we match @xmath12 to the form @xmath13 which simultaneously fixes the wave function renormalization factor @xmath14 , a renormalized expectation value @xmath15 and the renormalized mass @xmath16 . by solving these conditions",
    "we obtain @xmath17 and @xmath18 where we have introduced the dimensionless finite size scaling quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the usual lattice momentum @xmath21    it is not difficult to see that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath22 our definitions of @xmath16 and @xmath15 approach those of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xcite . apart from this limit however",
    ", each fixed value of @xmath19 defines a different renormalization scheme and the perturbative coefficients of the continuum perturbative callan symanzik @xmath25 function , for instance , will depend on @xmath19 beyond the scheme independent one and two loop terms .    as usual in the spontaneously broken theory",
    "we define the renormalized coupling constant in terms of @xmath15 by setting @xmath26",
    "the action in the lattice form is given by @xmath27 - 2 \\kappa \\sum_{x \\mu } \\varphi \\left ( x    \\right ) \\varphi \\left ( x + \\hat{\\mu } \\right)\\ ] ] with all dimensionless quantities .",
    "this is equivalent to the field theoretic form @xmath28 with mass dimension one field corresponds to @xmath29 in the lw papers . ]",
    "@xmath30 if we match @xmath31 classically , the symmetric phase arises for @xmath32 where @xmath33 fluctuate around zero with a bare mass given by @xmath34 for @xmath35 the field fluctuates around one of two equivalent nonzero values @xmath36 . the quadratic fluctuations around either constant field are now controlled by the bare mass @xmath37 note that in lw @xmath38 does not appear , as in @xcite it is replaced by @xmath39 while in @xcite the action in terms of @xmath30 is not written and only the @xmath39 for the broken phase appears .",
    "consequently the relations between @xmath39 and @xmath40 differ in the two papers as emphasized in a footnote in @xcite .",
    "following lw we explore the plane of bare parameters by approaching the critical line ( continuum limit ) on trajectories at fixed @xmath41 and define the @xmath25-function @xmath42 this definition entails the following tree level lattice artefact contributions @xmath43 and ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 although these artefacts are small they may be avoided by switching to modified couplings @xmath46    the perturbative continuum @xmath25 function for the coupling @xmath47 of the previous subsection  and also @xmath48 formed from it  is given by @xmath49 while the first two coefficients are scheme independent , the three loop term @xmath50 is at the moment not known for our present scheme at finite @xmath19",

    "the fugacity is @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60 configurations are in one - to - one correspondence with strong coupling graphs with lines drawn on links with @xmath61 . at the same time we have the connection with the spin formulation @xmath62 where for the ising limit the sum is over @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "is a normalization factor . in @xcite a lot more details about this reformulation and the efficient simulation of ( [ zens ] ) can be found .",
    "it is obvious now that the two point function is given by @xmath65 with the double angles referring to expectation values with respect to ( [ zens ] ) .",
    "the required fourier transforms can be directly accumulated from @xmath66 for the last step we have used the invariance under individual reflections along each direction .",
    "note that with the small momenta of interest we do not expect very rapid oscillations .",
    "as only ratios of @xmath67 , where the wave function renormalization cancels , are of interest , the denominator @xmath68 ( inverse susceptibility ) is never really needed here .",
    "at first we have explored how @xmath19 depends on the hopping parameter for lattice sizes @xmath69 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[zkappa ] .",
    "we are here just above the infinite volume critical point which is known @xcite to occur close to @xmath70 .",
    "each data point in the plot corresponds to @xmath71 iterations , where an iteration @xcite consists of one worm move per site . from these results",
    "we have decided to adopt in the following the target value @xmath72 for our study .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ tabg ] .",
    ".simulation results to determine the renormalized coupling in the continuum limit ( growing @xmath1 ) for fixed @xmath72.[tabg ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     each line corresponds to a statistics of @xmath73 iterations . by some tuning we found values of @xmath74 that lead to @xmath72 within errors .",
    "the directly measured couplings ( [ gdef ] ) are given in the fourth column while the rightmost column differs by two tiny corrections . by the first order reweighting technique described in @xcite the value",
    "is adjusted to @xmath72 exactly and then the cutoff correction ( [ gtildedef ] ) is applied .",
    "the first correction is clearly only a change within the error bars , but , although to a much lesser degree than in @xcite , it in addition lowers the statistical error slightly .",
    "these data are plotted in fig.[figg ] .",
    "the dotted ( blue ) , dashed ( red ) and solid ( black ) curves derive from integrating the callan symanzik equation @xmath75 with the continuum @xmath25-function at 1,2,3 loop perturbative precision . beside the universal coefficients ( [ betaf ] ) we here use the infinite volume value ( [ beta2 ] ) for the three loop coefficient .",
    "as discussed before this is only indicative with the presently unknown coefficient for @xmath72 certainly being slightly different .",
    "the experience in the symmetric phase has been , however , that at this size the difference may not be very sizeable .",
    "we have defined a finite size renormalization scheme for @xmath0 theory , which in the infinite volume limit goes over into the one that is standard in the broken phase of the model . in the ising limit of infinite bare coupling ,",
    "we have numerically generated values of the renormalized coupling as a function of the lattice cutoff .",
    "using novel simulation techniques we computed precise values which turn out to closely follow the perturbative renormalization group .",
    "the data points are nicely sandwiched between the one and two loop trajectories .",
    "the three loop curve falls in between and is only about two sigma ( 2 % ) away from our data , although the three loop coefficient is taken for @xmath76 rather than @xmath72 studied here .",
    "if we conclude agreement with perturbation theory in the range studied then this should be even better justified for larger @xmath1 and @xmath48 tends to zero in the continuum limit at a logarithmic rate .",
    "this supports the triviality scenario once more by combining numerical and perturbative methods .",
