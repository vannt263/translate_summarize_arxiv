    "it has been shown by maldacena that large n superconformal gauge theories have a dual description in terms of string theory in ads space @xcite .",
    "this proposal was realized by maldacena to compute the energy between quark @xmath2 and anti - quark @xmath3 pairs @xcite .",
    "his method was to calculate expectation values of an operator similar to the wilson loop in the large n limit of field theories .",
    "maldacena s idea was improved later by rey , theisen , and yee @xcite .",
    "it turns wilson loop into a physical gauge invariant property that can be read from the string picture .",
    "the @xmath0 energy in the large n superconformal @xmath4 yang - mills theory can be obtained from the wilson loop of the corresponding string in ads space .",
    "it is proposed that quark and anti - quark pairs live on the boundary , connected by a u - shaped string in the bulk . in the discussion on this spacetime",
    ", the energy has a non - confining coulomb - like behavior , as expected for a conformal field theory .",
    "later this approach was applied to many other spaces and models , as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , gravity duals for a certain galilean - invariant conformal field theory has attracted some attention in theoretical high energy physics community @xcite .",
    "a special case when we take the dynamical exponent @xmath5 of this theory ( whose isometry is the schrodinger group @xmath6 ) is considered to be the basis in constructing duality between gravity and unitary fermi gas .",
    "however , our interest in this paper is the theory with an arbitrary dynamical exponent @xmath1 , i.e. galilean invariant cft . in this general scheme",
    ", one can discuss the non - relativistic version of the ads / cft dictionary , i.e. the operator - state correspondence between the particle on the boundary and the string in the bulk .",
    "scaling transformation in this non - relativistic conformal symmetry can be written as @xcite @xmath7    the asymptotic metric in this case can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the characteristic radius of space - time , @xmath10 is a compact light - like coordinate , @xmath11 for @xmath12, ... ,@xmath13 together with @xmath14 are the space - time coordinates on the boundary where ( [ eq12 ] ) is mapped at @xmath15 , and finally @xmath16 is the metric of a suitable internal manifold geometry which allows ( [ eq12 ] ) to be a solution of the supergravity equations of motion .",
    "the extra dimension @xmath10 is usually associated with quantum numbers interpreted as the particle number .",
    "however , the relation between translation in @xmath10 and its interpretation as particle number operator is still an unclear topic @xcite .",
    "thus we just set this time - like extra dimension @xmath10 to be constant .",
    "the holographic wilson loop in non - relativistic cft had been studied by kluson in ref .",
    "he assumed general time dependence of @xmath10 and also the moving @xmath0 pair cases in the context of non - relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "his study was devoted to the space - time with galilean symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , he still does not include analysis of convexity conditions ( [ eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq32 ] ) yet .",
    "one needs to verify these conditions in @xmath0 potential discussions to make sure that the corresponding potential function @xmath17 is a monotone non - decreasing and convex function of the separation @xmath18 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to verify these conditions for @xmath0 potential , which is obtained by calculating the wilson loop in the string picture in galilean space - time .",
    "furthermore , we would like to see the restrictions which may appear for acceptable dynamical exponent @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will perform calculations to acquire the @xmath0 potential energy in galilean space - time . in section 3",
    ", we will derive some conditions for acceptable @xmath1 due to convexity inequality .",
    "finally in section 4 , there is a summary of our findings .",
    "we will start with the nambu - goto action @xmath19 for metric ( [ eq12 ] ) where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is space - time metric in ( [ eq12 ] ) , and impose suitable ansatzs in describing static strings , i.e. @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "kluson in ref .",
    "@xcite has considered a more general case for an extra time - like dimension @xmath10 as a @xmath26-dependent variable , but we can simply set @xmath10 to be constant ( for example as disucussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) since the @xmath0 potential would depend on their separation distance and @xmath27 in our @xmath28 dimensional world , i.e. on the boundary of the galilean bulk , see fig.[qq2 ] . ] only .",
    "the corresponding action can be written as @xmath29 for @xmath30 and we have used @xmath31 .",
    "variable @xmath32 in ( [ eq22 ] ) is the loop period and can be written this way due to the time translation invariance of action ( [ eq21 ] ) for metric ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "we have followed a standard prescription that has been used in some literature , for example refs .",
    "@xcite , in obtaining the action ( [ eq22 ] ) as well as the corresponding @xmath0 potential as a function of @xmath0 pair s distance .",
    "though the metric ( 2.1 ) is not diagonal , but action ( [ eq22 ] ) leads us to a problem of wilson loop computation which can be started by finding a geodesic in the effective 2-dimensional geometry @xcite @xmath33    the equation of motion ( geodesic line ) from ( [ eq22 ] ) is @xmath34 @xmath35 is the maximum position of the u - shaped string with respect to the @xmath36-coordinate ( bulk radius , see fig .",
    "[ qq2 ] ) . from ( [ eq24 ] )",
    "one can obtain the separation distance of quark and anti - quark on the boundary , by integrating the geodesic with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "since the boundary is at @xmath37 , then the separation as the function of @xmath35 can be obtained by the following integration @xmath38 related to the expression for the @xmath0 separation above , one may provide such an illustration as depicted in fig .",
    "[ qq2 ] .",
    "pair on the boundary as each ends of string.,width=302 ]    inserting @xmath30 to ( [ eq25 ] ) and using the beta function in our computation give the following exact result @xmath39 then we follow a general prescription in refs .",
    "@xcite to compute the energy between quark and anti - quark .",
    "we have a general form of total @xmath0 energy as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is considered as the energy of non interacting quark @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath0 potential can be written as @xmath42 @xmath43 which can also be computed by the use of beta function .",
    "the potential is @xmath44 in the next section we will see the compatibility of the potential ( [ eq29 ] ) with convexity conditions .",
    "there are some conditions that should be satisfied by any potential which describes interaction between quark and anti - quark whose name convexity conditions @xcite @xmath45 and @xmath46 condition ( [ eq31 ] ) means quark and anti - quark are attractive everywhere , and ( [ eq32 ] ) tells us that the potential is a monotone non - increasing function of their separation .",
    "these conditions can be verified as follows @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 the two last equations are inequalities for physically accepted @xmath1 based on convexity conditions for the @xmath50 pair .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors present simple embeddings of duals for nonrelativistic critical points , where the dynamical critical exponent can take many values @xmath51 .",
    "they find that @xmath52 and @xmath53 as the possible dynamical critical exponents that allow string embeddings in gauge / gravity dual picture . from their paper @xcite , we could learn that our @xmath54 would depend on the coordinates of the internal manifold @xmath55 .",
    "hartnoll and yoshida write the non - compact part of the metric which can accommodate a large number of values of @xmath1 by the following ansatz in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath56 in this paper . ]",
    "@xmath57 which modifies our previous @xmath58 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "nevertheless , the function @xmath61 would not appear in ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) .",
    "thus our findings on the restrictions for @xmath1 can be applied to the work of hartnoll and yoshida in ref .",
    "one can verify that conditions ( [ eq33 ] ) and ( [ eq34 ] ) are fulfilled for @xmath52 , and also for @xmath53 .",
    "the negativity of @xmath62 for @xmath63 guarantees both ( [ eq33 ] ) and ( [ eq34 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "we have calculated the potential between @xmath64 and @xmath27 in the non - relativistic quantum field theory by using the wilson loop analysis in the gauge / gravity correspondence in the galilean bulk .",
    "our findings are inequalities ( [ eq33 ] ) and ( [ eq34 ] ) for physically acceptable dynamical exponent @xmath1 from convexity conditions .",
    "yoshida and hartnoll @xcite have found families of @xmath1 for string embeddings in galilean space - time , i.e. @xmath65 and @xmath53 , which agree with inequalities ( [ eq33 ] ) and ( [ eq34 ] ) above .",
