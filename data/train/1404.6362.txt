    "our result on the existence of the traveling front will be proved using a variational method introduced by steffen heinze  @xcite .",
    "it is explained later in this section .",
    "heinze studied problem in infinite cylinders of @xmath63 instead of half - spaces . for these domains and for both bistable and combustion nonlinearities",
    ", he showed the existence of a traveling front . using a rearrangement technique after making the change of variables @xmath64",
    ", he also proved the monotonicity of the front .",
    "in addition , @xcite found an interesting formula , , for the front speed in terms of the minimum value of the variational problem .",
    "the formula has interesting consequences , such as part ( iv ) of our theorem : the relation between the speeds for two comparable nonlinearities .    for our existence result we will proceed as in @xcite . the weakly lower semicontinuity of the problem will be more delicate in our case due to the unbounded character of the problem in the @xmath65 variable a feature not present in cylinders .",
    "the rearrangement technique will produce a monotone front .",
    "its monotonicity will be crucial in order to establish that it has limits 1 and 0 as @xmath29 .",

    "in a half - plane has been studied by caffarelli , mellet , and sire  @xcite , a paper performed at the same time as most of our work .",
    "they establish the existence of a speed admitting a monotone front .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , our approaches towards the existence result are different .",
    "their work does not use minimization methods , but instead approximation by truncated problems in bounded domains as in @xcite .",
    "they also rely in an interesting explicit formula for traveling fronts of a free boundary problem obtained as a singular limit of .",
    "in addition , @xcite establishes the following precise behavior of the combustion front at the side of the invaded state @xmath73 . for some constant @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( here we follow our notation ; @xcite reverses the states @xmath73 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "note that the decay for combustion fronts is different than ours : @xmath76 in is replaced by @xmath77 in the bistable case .",
    "note however that the main order in the decays is @xmath78 and that the exponent @xmath25 depends in a highly nontrivial way on each nonlinearity  @xmath12 .",
    "uniqueness issues for the speed or for the front in problem are treated for first time in the present paper .",
    "our result on uniqueness of the speed and of the front relies heavily on the powerful sliding method of berestycki and nirenberg @xcite .",
    "we also use a comparison principle analogue to one in the paper by the first author and sol - morales @xcite , which studied problem with @xmath79 . among other things , @xcite established the existence , uniqueness , and monotonicity of a front for when @xmath79 and @xmath12 is a balanced bistable nonlinearity .",
    "it was shown also there that in the balanced bistable case , the front reaches its limits 1 and 0 at the power rate @xmath80 .",
    "we point out that the variational method in the present paper requires @xmath12 to be non - balanced .",
    "it can not be carried out in the balanced case .",
    "suppose now that @xmath12 satisfies the assumptions made above for bistable nonlinearities except for condition , and assume instead that @xmath81 first , if the above integral is zero ( i.e. , @xmath12 is balanced ) , @xcite established the existence of a monotone front for @xmath12 with speed @xmath79 .",

    "second , we have @xmath92 .",
    "note that our main result states that there is a unique @xmath3 for which the fractional equation admits a solution connecting 1 and 0 .    as in the paper by the first author and sire @xcite , which studied problem @xmath93 in @xmath94 for balanced bistable nonlinearities , the construction of explicit fronts will be based on the fundamental solution for the homogeneous heat equation associated to the fractional operator in , that is , equation @xmath95 the process to find such heat kernel uses an idea from the paper @xcite by caffarelli , mellet , and sire , and it is explained in section [ explicit ] below .    regarding the resulting decays and for bistable fronts , note that the exponential decay at the side of the invaded state @xmath73 is much faster than the power decay at the side of the invading state @xmath38 . this large difference of rates is clearly seen in the explicit fronts that we built .",
    "see figure  [ dibujoexpl ] for the plots of one of such fronts , where the much steeper decay on the right is clearly appreciated .",
    "these decays are also in contrast with the classical ones for the bistable equation @xmath96 in @xmath94 , which are both pure exponentials with exponents that may be different at @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "note however that the exponent @xmath25 in the exponential term at @xmath97 for our problem will be different , in general , than the corresponding exponent in the classical case taking here the same nonlinearity  @xmath12 for both problems .",

    "in contrast with the decay in @xcite for combustion nonlinearities , in the bistable case @xcite shows that the front reaches its two limiting values at the rate @xmath126 as in @xcite for balanced bistable nonlinearities .",
    "next , let us describe the structure of the variational problem that will lead to our existence result .",
    "first , we enumerate the five concrete properties of the nonlinearity needed for all the results of the paper to be true .",
    "[ nonl ]    even that we state our main result for bistable and combustion type nonlinearities ( for the clarity of the reading ) , all our proofs require only the following five conditions on  @xmath12 : @xmath127 we claim that both positively - balanced bistable nonlinearities and combustion nonlinearities as in definition  [ nonlinearterm ] satisfy the above five assumptions",
    ".    the claim is easily seen . for a combustion nonlinearity , is obviously true , while the last condition in holds ( indeed with an equality ) for the same @xmath128 as in part ( b ) of the definition .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath12 of bistable type , since @xmath12 has a unique zero @xmath18 in @xmath19 and holds , it follows that @xmath129 in @xmath130 and @xmath131 in @xmath132 .",

    "consider now the potential @xmath138 defined by @xmath139 note that @xmath140 in @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath142 and @xmath143 due to hypothesis , we have that @xmath144    two other important properties of @xmath145 are the following .",

    "this will be essential in order to prove that our variational problem attains its infimum .",
    "in addition , the constraint will introduce a lagrange multiplier and , through it , the apriori unknown speed @xmath25 of the traveling front .",
    "as already noted by heinze  @xcite , the above variational method produces an interesting formula for the speed @xmath25 .",
    "one has @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the minimum value of the constraint variational problem ; see remark  [ mirema ] below .",
    "this formula leads to the comparison result between the front speeds for two different comparable nonlinearities part ( iv ) of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "note also that the value @xmath175 in does not depend on which constant @xmath176 is chosen to carry out the minimization problem .",
    "the reason is that this value coincides with the speed  @xmath25 , and we prove uniqueness of the speed .",

    "that is , it is a solution of the problem @xmath180 where @xmath181 . an interesting application of the constraint minimization method",
    "is that , when carried out in @xmath71 and @xmath72 , it produces another type of traveling fronts .",
    "their trace @xmath182 will not depend only on one euclidean variable @xmath178 of @xmath179 ( as the solutions in the present paper do ) , but they will be monotone with limits 1 and 0 at infinity in the direction @xmath178 and will be even with limits 0 at @xmath183 on the @xmath26 variables orthogonal to @xmath178 .",
    "the reason is that here one minimizes the energy functional @xmath184 under the constraint on the dirichlet energy , where @xmath185 is a non - unitary direction parallel to @xmath178 .",
    "now , note that the solutions built in this paper , which are constant in the @xmath26 variables orthogonal to @xmath176 , do not belong to the corresponding energy space ( since they have infinite dirichlet energy ) .",

    "we prove a monotonicity and comparison result by means of a maximum principle and the sliding method .",
