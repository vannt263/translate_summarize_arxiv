    "the mass of psrj0751 + 1807  is the largest measured for any pulsar . as shown in figure  [ fig : m1pb ] , pulsars in circular orbits with helium white dwarf companions tend to have masses greater than the canonical value of 1.35@xmath2 .",

    "an inverse correlation between orbital period and pulsar mass is apparent in figure  [ fig : m1pb ] .",
    "any such relation is likely to be complicated by the different evolutionary paths followed by different systems .",

    "helium white dwarf binaries , which underwent extended stable mass transfer . in the library of evolutionary tracks calculated by @xcite , such systems show an inverse correlation between orbital period and pulsar mass , although there is a wide spread in pulsar mass for a given orbital period . in these calculations",
    ", it was assumed that half of the mass lost by the secondary was accreted onto the neutron star ; whether the mass accreted onto the neutron star is , in fact , proportional to the mass lost by the secondary remains an open question .",
    "psrs  j0751 + 1807 and j1012 + 5307 , with their short orbital periods , provide a challenge to binary evolution theories .",
    "evolution calculations tend not to produce systems with binary periods close to the orbital period of psrj0751 + 1807  at the end of mass transfer .",

    "white dwarf binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite are able to produce the properties of the psrj0751 + 1807  system by invoking magnetic braking and heating of the secondary by irradiation from the pulsar .",
    "the latter effect drives mass loss in the secondary , increasing the orbital separation and preventing the binary from shrinking into an ultracompact system .",

    "the orbit of psrj0751 + 1807  decays at a rate of @xmath125 .",
    "this is in line with the expected value from general relativity . combined with shapiro delay measurements , it implies the pulsar and secondary star masses are @xmath1@xmath2  and @xmath126@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the mass of psrj0751 + 1807  is the largest recorded for a pulsar , and it may imply greater mass is transferred in tighter low mass neutron star binary systems than in wider systems .",
    "the maximum mass attainable by a neutron star depends on the stars composition and the equation of state of nuclear matter .",
    "@xcite calculated neutron star mass  radius relationships for a number of plausible equations of state .",
    "they found that models with exotic components , such as pure quark stars or mixed phases with kaon condensate or strange quark matter , allow neutron stars to attain masses no higher than @xmath127@xmath2 .",
    "while the measurement of the psrj0751 + 1807  mass is nominally above this limit , the measurement uncertainty is not yet small enough to draw firm conclusions on this point .    the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath33 scales with observation span to the @xmath32.5 power for uniformly sampled data .",
    "the precision of this measurement can , therefore , be increased dramatically with a relatively small number of observations over the next few years . the shapiro delay measurement , because it has no such time dependence , will improve more slowly , and hence uncertainty in the shapiro delay ( and hence in the inclination ) will ultimately dominate the uncertainty in the mass measurement .",
