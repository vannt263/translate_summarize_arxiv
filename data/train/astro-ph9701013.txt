    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) segment of the spectrum is an excellent tool to identify and quantize active star formation ( sf ) regions ( donas 1987 ) .",
    "it is also a sensitive probe of evolved hot stellar populations ( burstein 1988 ) .",
    "therefore , uv observations may serve to understand processes of sf and stellar evolution .",
    "these processes are amplified and enhanced in a cluster environment , due to interactions among galaxies , and between galaxies and the intracluster medium . in the case of the virgo cluster ( vc ) the observations are optimized by the proximity of the region , despite the vc not being a fully relaxed cluster . throughout this work",
    "we * assume * a uniform distance of 18 mpc to all the galaxies in the vc .",
    "a smaller cluster distance , @xmath1 mpc , is suggested by the [ oiii ] distances to planetary nebulae ( jacoby 1990 ) , but visvanathan and griersmith ( 1979 ) give 17.9 mpc , in agreement with sandage and tammann ( 1974 ) .",
    "we note that the depth of the cluster ( @xmath24 mpc ) is significant in comparison to the distance to the cluster .",
    "the vc was studied intensively by many groups ; we shall not give here a thorough review of all publications but mention in particular the extensive compilation of binggeli , sandage and tammann ( 1985 , bst ) .",
    "their vc catalog relied mainly on the morphological appearance of a galaxy on large plate - scale photographs , to determine whether an object is member of the vc or lies in its fore- or background .",
    "in addition , the many papers by hoffman and collaborators ( hoffman 1989a , 1989b ; hoffman 1989 ; hoffman 1995 ) used hi observations from the arecibo observatory to determine the large - scale - structure in the direction of the vc . the combination of hi and optical redshifts for many of the galaxies indicates the existence of a void in the distribution of galaxies located behind the vc and in front of the great wall at 5500@xmath3cz@xmath313500 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the complex structure of the vc region was analyzed by hoffman ( 1989a ) in the context of the blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) in the cluster .",
    "their fig .",
    "4 emphasizes the positions of the various groups and clouds of galaxies in this region .",
    "they also established upper limits to the number of hi clouds devoid of optical counterparts in the cluster , and considered other observational properties of these galaxies , such as their fir emission from iras and optical properties .",
    "hoffman ( 1995 ) studied the background galaxies beyond the vc , in the context of their clustering properties .",
    "a reanalysis of the velocity distribution of vc galaxies ( binggeli , popescu and tammann 1993 ) showed a slight difference in the cluster redshift ( 1050@xmath535 km s@xmath4 ) from the previously accepted value ( 1094 km s@xmath4 ; binggeli , tammann and sandage 1987 ) .",
    "in addition to the void behind virgo mentioned by hoffman ( 1995 ) , they found a significant lack of galaxies behind virgo , from 3000 to 3500 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we consider here all galaxies in the direction of the vc and with v@xmath6 km s@xmath4 as cluster members , disregarding their membership in the virgo core or the various sub - clusters .",
    "x  ray observations with the rosat pspc ( trinchieri 1994 ) showed that at least one virgo cluster galaxy ( ngc 4636 ) may be interacting with vc gas to produce significant x - ray flux at @xmath23 mpc from m87 .",
    "other such galaxies may be m86 ( forman 1979 ) and possibly ngc 4472 ( trinchieri 1986 ) .",
    "in addition , we mention the discovery of very soft x - ray emission from m87 ( lieu 1996 ) by the euve satellite , with 31 counts per 1000 sec in the 100 band . the x - ray and far - infrared emission from m87 , together with subtle optical asymmetries seen mainly in the blue , induced white ( 1991 ) to propose that this galaxy is stripped of its interstellar material by some hot gas , present at the core of the vc .",
    "high resolution hst observations of absorptions in the uv spectrum of 3c273 at the redshift of the vc ( weymann 1995 and references therein ) indicate that the absorptions are probably produced by low - column - density clouds with low metallicity .",
    "one need they clearly identify is to evaluate the metagalactic background ionizing radiation field , away from the vicinity of normal galaxies ; we attempt this by using new uv observations from approximately the entire virgo cluster , obtained by the faust payload .",
    "a few galaxies in the virgo cluster were observed in the vacuum uv by the ans satellite ( wesselius 1982 ) .",
    "more were observed by the rocket payloads of smith and cornett ( 1982 ) and kodaira ( 1990 ) , and recently by the faust imager ( see section 2 , below ) on board the atlas1 shuttle experiment ( bowyer 1993 ) .",
    "additional measurements from a balloon  mounted telescope were reported by donas ( 1987 ) .",
    "smith and cornett ( 1982 ) observed the cluster with a wide field camera ( 11@xmath7 fov ) with a cste intensifier coupled with photographic film behind a quartz window , which define a passband with fwhm@xmath81150 and constant  energy mean wavelength of 2421 .",
    "their absolute calibration relies of @xmath9 vir , calibrated during the td1 mission against vega , and uv magnitudes or upper limits are given for 201 galaxies .",
    "donas ( 1987 ) used the scap 2000 balloon ",
    "borne telescope to image various regions of the sky in a band @xmath2125 wide centered near 2000 .",
    "the scap telescope was a 17 cm diameter reflector with a 6@xmath10 field - of - view , imaging on film behind a uv - to - visible image converter / amplifier . among the galaxies listed by donas 12 are members of the virgo cluster .",
    "the guv experiment ( onaka 1989 ) consisted of two 17 cm diameter imagers with a 4@xmath10 field of view and was launched in 1987 on board a sounding rocket .",
    "the guv sensitivity response had a fwhm@xmath8200 and peaked near 1450 .",
    "the results relevant to virgo cluster galaxies were presented by kodaira ( 1990 ) and a discussion of the diffuse uv light ( mainly galactic ) in the direction of the virgo cluster was given by onaka and kodaira ( 1991 ) .",
    "the galaxies paper gives uv fluxes for 42 galaxies observed by guv and upper limits for another 47 galaxies .",
    "note that the reported final angular resolution of the guv experiment was 16.0@xmath118.2 ( kodaira 1990 ) and the equivalent exposure time on the virgo cluster was 176 sec .",
    "faust ( far ultraviolet space telescope ) is a wide - field ( @xmath12 field of view ) telescope with a bandpass between 1400 and 1800  and an angular resolution of 3.5 arcminutes .",
    "it utilizes a microchannel plate detector with wedge and strip anode , which records the position of each detected photon .",
    "descriptions of faust and its operation aboard atlas1 were given by lampton ( 1993 ) and chakrabarti ( 1993 ) .",
    "details of the image construction and subsequent reductions are given in bowyer ( 1993 ) .",
    "a catalog of 4660 uv sources detected by faust was produced by bowyer ( 1995 ) .",
    "the virgo cluster region was imaged on three different faust frames , with typical exposures ranging from 630 sec ( northernmost frame ) to 1250 sec ( southernmost frame ) .",
    "the images are separated by @xmath13 in declination , with the middle image centered on m87 and each pixel is @xmath21.11 arcmin .",
    "the point source fluxes can be converted to physical units with a calibration derived in flight from observations of stars that were observed by iue ( bowyer 1993 ) .",
    "the total sky coverage of the three virgo cluster frames , defined as the region with non ",
    "zero exposure and allowing for image overlap , is @xmath0 square degrees .",
    "the entire region is at high galactic latitude ( b@xmath1465@xmath10 ) and is shown in figure 1 .",
    "a general discussion of uv properties of some galaxies observed by faust , in which 29 virgo cluster objects are included , was given by deharveng ( 1994 ) .",
    "an impartial source detector algorithm , described in brosch ( 1995 ) , operated on the three faust images of the virgo cluster and produced a list of 191 uv sources , some appearing on more than one image , with their faust uv flux and equatorial coordinates ( table 1 ) .",
    "objects for which the coordinates were calculated from an astrometric solution based on bright , well - identified stellar images , have their coordinates in table 1 marked with an asterisk .",
    "note that , because of the character of the faust images , different regions of the images are exposed for different times .",
    "therefore , the detection of sources here is not flux - limited , but rather signal - to - noise limited .",
    "the flux was measured with a simulated round aperture of diameter 13.2 arcmin .",
    "this is large enough to include all the flux from any galaxy in the vc , thus we did not distinguish between point and extended sources .",
    "a few very bright uv sources ( stars brighter than @xmath26.5 ) were measured with a larger simulated aperture .",
    "the sky contribution was derived from a square box with 44 arcmin sides , except for the few bright sources , where the sides were 77 arcmin .",
    "table 1 lists also the error in the flux ; this was calculated by combining in quadrature the instrumental and systematic errors .",
    "the first was obtained from the `` photon statistics '' distribution of the events from which the sky brightness was calculated .",
    "the systematic errors , originating from the laboratory calibration and the intrinsic errors in the iue scale , are estimated by bowyer ( 1993 ) to be 15.8% of the measured flux , _ i.e. , _ an additional error of 0.16 mag to the monochromatic magnitude used here . the full analysis of the uv source list , the identification of uv sources with catalogued objects , and follow - up optical observations of non - catalogued sources , are the subject of this paper .      the three faust images have considerable overlap .",
    "this allows the comparison of magnitudes for a significant number of sources , which appear on two or three images .",
    "the comparison of different magnitudes for the same objects is shown in figure 2 .",
    "objects measured three times , which appear in the region of overlap of all images , are represented by three points connected with straight lines , each corresponding to one pair of measurements .",
    "2 shows 133 pairs of values , after deleting the six brightest and the three faintest pairs of points , for which observational biases could modify the correlation , we find that the correlation coefficient between pairs of measurements of the same object is 0.94 .",
    "the slope of the relation is consistent with unity within 2@xmath15 ( 0.93@xmath50.03 ) .",
    "the mean error in the comparison among different observations of the same object is 0.28 mag .",
    "we conclude that the faust measurements in the virgo cluster area are internally consistent over at least a six - magnitude range .",
    "we compared our detections with those listed by bowyer ( 1995 ) in the faust catalog .",
    "we find that the absolute majority of our sources have been listed in the catalog , but 8% ( 16 ) were detected here while having no catalog counterpart .",
    "as mentioned above , we used here a different automatic detection criterion than used by bowyer in most cases , these sources are faint , or appear in a single faust image , or both ; they may be artifacts but we accept them here as genuine as there is no clear reason to reject them .",
    "table 1 lists in its last column the faust catalog number(s ) of sources corresponding to our detections .",
    "again , in most cases the proposed identifications coincide .",
    "we found that a number of sources listed in the faust catalog of bowyer ( 1995 ) could be `` merged '' as a single source .",
    "these presumably are the result of the automated processing of faust catalog sources and in all cases are sources which appear in more than a single faust image .",
    "an extreme example is v66=n4438 , which appears on three faust images and was listed in bowyer as three separate sources .",
    "the identification of the detected sources is based mainly on positional coincidence with catalogued objects .",
    "we used various catalogs of stars , such as the smithsonian astrophysical observatory s ( sao 1966 ) , the hipparcos input catalog ( turon 1993 ) , the td-1 catalog ( thompson 1978 ) ) , _ etc .",
    "_ we identified galaxies using the third revised catalog of galaxies ( de vaucouleurs 1991 ; rc3 ) and the principal galaxy catalog ( pgc ; paturel 1992 ) , mainly through the leda data bank .",
    "in addition to positional coincidence ( 3 error box ) , we applied some astrophysical constraints .",
    "for example , if near the position of the uv source the catalogs listed a bright late - type star , but slightly further away we found a uv - bright object such as a sub - dwarf , we accepted the latter as the proper counterpart .    in cases",
    "when no suitable catalogued counterpart could be found within 3 of the faust position , we inspected the palomar sky survey ( pss ) prints at the wise observatory .",
    "we searched in the immediate neighborhood of a uv source location for ( a ) relatively bright objects , with ( b ) bluish colors , as could be determined from a comparison of the e and o plates .",
    "these candidate counterparts were observed at the wise observatory ( see section 3 , below ) .      among the various uv observations toward the virgo cluster ,",
    "those by guv ( kodaira 1990 ) have a very similar bandpass and may be used to check external consistency , along with those objects observed by iue . the guv experiment operated during two observation periods .",
    "the `` acquisition '' ( a ) phase and the `` pointing '' ( p ) phase . during the a phase , with",
    "the payload scanning and being spin - stabilized , 39 sources and one upper limit were detected and identified with known stars ( table 1 , onaka 1989 ) .",
    "the faust experiment detected 8 of these stars ; the remaining guv sources lie outside the field observed by faust . in the pointed phase",
    "the telescopes were kept within one degree of their intended pointings , with a drift rate of 0.5 s@xmath4 .",
    "the final resolution of the guv p phase images , after stacking 70 images with 2.52 sec exposure each , was @xmath16=16.0 and @xmath17=8.2 .    among the sources detected during the pointing phase and listed in table 2 of onaka ( 1989 ) ,",
    "five were detected by faust and identified with stars .",
    "an improved reduction of the p phase data led to the identification of some 42 galaxies and of further anonymous sources ( table 1 and table 4 of kodaira 1990 ) .",
    "faust detected 23 of the galaxies of kodaira ( 1990 ) and four of the anonymous sources have been identified with known stars .",
    "thus the total number of detected sources in common by the two experiments is 39 and one upper limit .",
    "nine galaxies detected by guv were missed by faust : ic3255 , n4360 , ic3371 , n4458 , n4459 , n4473 , ic 3425 , ic3457 , n4503 , ic3483 , ic3501 .",
    "ic3255 is listed as faust source 3110 by bowyer ( 1995 ) with a s / n@xmath184.4 . for this reason it had not been selected by the algorithm which produced the present list .",
    "the remaining sources do not appear in the bowyer ( 1995 ) catalogue .",
    "as for the anonymous objects of table 4 of kodaira ( 1991 ) , five ( a1221 + 09.7 , a1221 + 12.7 , a1224 + 14.2 , a1231 + 10.7 , a1235 + 10.2 ) were missed here as well as in the faust catalog ( bowyer 1995 ) . the p10 source ( table 2 of onaka 1989 )",
    "is listed as catalog source 3195 , but is missed in the present list , due to low s / n .",
    "below we comment on several sources , for which the better resolution of faust allows an improved identification .",
    "the two guv sources identified as n4387 and n4402 , and the upper limit source identified as n4406 , overlap .",
    "faust detected only one source , v51 , better identified as n4406 .",
    "the guv source identified as n4435 is interacting with n4438 , which is tidally disturbed and is faust v66 .",
    "ic3416 is 5 from v74 , which is identified here as a f0 star .",
    "n4497 is not a good identification .",
    "the faust source v90 is identified with ic3446 , which is nearer the uv location than n4497 .",
    "n4564 was identified as the guv source , but it overlaps with n4567 and n4568 .",
    "n4567 is faust v126 .",
    "ic3583 overlaps with n4569=v129 .",
    "the guv source a1224 + 08.8 lies in the field of v56 and v62 .",
    "see the comment in section 3.1 .",
    "the source a1225 + 11.5 ( p2 ) is 4 south of v64 and can be identified with hd108452 ( a0 ) .",
    "note that fig .",
    "5 of onaka ( 1989 ) is reversed and north is at the bottom .",
    "a1225 + 11.8 ( p3 ) is close to v65 .",
    "a1227 + 08.6 ( p7 ) corresponds to v82 .",
    "the anonymous object suggested by onaka ( 1989 ) has been observed to be a late - b star [ s122710 + 083901 ] .",
    "a1230 + 13.2 is v102 , observed to be a late - b star [ s123030 + 131240 ] .",
    "a1232 + 09.7 ( p17 ) corresponds to v122 .",
    "the object near the uv position has been observed to be a late - b star [ s123252 + 094327 ] .",
    "our analysis shows that , unfortunately , guv can not serve as an external confirmatory source for faust .",
    "this is a result of the faust exposures being deeper and having better resolution , as well as being calibrated against iue measurements . despite those aspects ,",
    "it is reassuring to see that ( a ) most `` real '' sources of guv * were * found by us , and ( b ) spurious guv sources , with low s / n , * were not * detected by two different source - finding algorithms in the faust images ; that of bowyer ( 1995 ) and the one used by us .",
    "one hundred and forty six sources were identified with stars or galaxies , as explained above .",
    "the remaining 45 faust detections were inspected on both pss copies at the wise observatory , to identify possible counterparts below the magnitude limit of the catalogs we consulted .",
    "spectroscopic observations of these candidates from the wise observatory resulted in 31 sources identified as stars , which we classified as hot stars . in 7 faust fields we did not observe all possible stellar candidates ( v1 , v65 , v92 , v99 , v112 , v119 , and v180 ) .",
    "two other faust sources were found to have no reliable optical counterpart on pure astrophysical reasons : these are v101 and v154 , which are discussed in sub - section 3.1 below .",
    "the remaining 5 sources ( v56 , v62 , v104 , v116 , and v125 ) are discussed below is section 3.1 .",
    "all these 14 sources are labelled `` no i d '' in table 1 .",
    "we used the fosc ( faint object spectrometer camera ) in spectroscopic mode for these observations .",
    "the instrument consists of a focal reducer camera with a collimated beam section and long - slit focal plane entrance apertures .",
    "the fosc operates at the f/7 focal position of the 1 meter telescope of the wise observatory .",
    "it is possible to insert grisms in the collimated beam section to disperse the incoming light .",
    "we used grisms with 300 gr / mm or 600 gr / mm , and a wedged window as beam steerer to center the desired spectral region onto a ti ccd chip .",
    "the ccd has a 1024x1000 pixel format , but for spectral observations only the relevant part of the chip , containing the spectrum of the object and that of the nearby sky , was read and recorded .",
    "the fosc spectra in the first configuration cover the region from @xmath24000 to @xmath28000 with @xmath24 per pixel .",
    "subsequently , the ti ccd was changed to a tektronix 1024@xmath111024 pixel back - illuminated ccd with a metachrome ii coating to enhance its blue - uv response .",
    "the pixels of this chip are larger than those of the ti . in this configuration",
    "the spectra cover the range from @xmath23750 to @xmath27100 with @xmath23.5 / pixel .",
    "each object was observed in a slitless configuration ( thus the seeing disk defined the entrance aperture ) .",
    "we observed spectrophotometric standard stars and obtained calibration exposures of a he  ar arc with a 2 \" slit together with the candidate sources .",
    "flat fields were obtained of the twilight sky and of an internal incandescent filament lamp .",
    "the spectra were extracted from the ccd images after debiasing and were flat fielded and divided pixel - by - pixel by a similarly processed spectrum of the standard star .",
    "figures 3a to 3d show representative spectra obtained for some survey sources . in the spectrum of v24 it is possible to see a flux depression near 4650 .",
    "this is an artefact caused by the standard star used to reduce the observations of that particular night .",
    "the flux depression appears in all spectra obtained during that specific night .",
    "most spectra show only balmer absorption features .",
    "the lines are pronounced , but * not * extremely wide , indicating that the objects are probably not da white dwarfs .",
    "no heii features are observed .",
    "we compared the fosc spectra with `` template '' spectra from jacoby ( 1984 ) and from silva and cornell ( 1992 ) .",
    "most appear to be early  type stars , from mid  b to late ",
    "a or f. the resolution is not sufficient to distinguish between main sequence and giant luminosity classes , but supergiants appear to be ruled out in most cases , because supergiant b stars have almost no h@xmath19 absorption while late a supergiants show reasonably deep hei @xmath205876 absorption .",
    "the wiseobs spectral types of all the candidate optical counterparts are listed in table 2 , along with those typing data obtained from the literature .    the distribution of all faust uv sources in the virgo fields , detected here and identified as described above , is summarized in table 3 .",

    "the density of detected and identified faust stellar uv sources in the direction of the vc does not differ from that to the ngp . despite this ,",
    "no white dwarfs ( wds ) are identified in the vc uv images .",
    "the space distribution of ( da ) wds was studied by boyle ( 1989 ) and was included in the model of the uv sky ( brosch 1991 ) .",
    "we modeled the stellar distribution for the vc central location using the faust spectral bandpass and show a comparison of the detected _ vs. _ the predicted stellar density in figure 4 .",
    "the model follows the actual stellar distribution down to m@xmath3211 , where incompleteness sets in , but does not reproduce it with great fidelity ( half the data points up to the completeness limit are more than 1@xmath15 from the model ) .",
    "it is possible that this is a `` small - numbers '' effect because of the size of the sample , since according to our model , there should be at least three wds in a 100@xmath30 wide field up to a uv magnitude limit of 14 .",
    "about 140 stars of all types , to this magnitude limit , should have been detected .",

    "the discrepancy with the expected number of wds remains unsolved .",
    "one possibility is that the missing wds are among the no i d sources , another is that some were mis - classified by us as a or b stars , where in reality they were das ( _ e.g. _ , v152 , v169 or v186 ) .",
    "another is that wds are observationally discriminated against , when searched for in the vicinity of a cluster of galaxies . a similar `` avoidance '' of galactic stars by qsos ( in objective - prism surveys )",
    "was demonstrated by gould , bahcall and maoz ( 1993 ) .",
    "v24=s121757 + 101353 has been shown by our spectroscopic observations to be an early - g v=13.2 object .",
    "its spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "note that the 4650 absorption - like feature is an artefact ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the [ faust  v ] color , 5.72 , is very blue for such a spectral type , where more yellowish colors are expected .",
    "the source was detected on two separate faust images and its count statistics is reasonable .",
    "we have therefore reasonable confidence of its reality and of the accuracy of the uv magnitude .",
    "the visual magnitude is from the hst guide star catalog ; its accuracy is of order 0.10.2 mag ( ratnatunga 1990 ) .",
    "such a blue uv  v color index is expected only from a `` mixed '' source , where a late - type optically - bright star is paired with a hot companion , which outshines the late - type star in the uv .",
    "this star is , therefore , a candidate for such a mixed binary object .",
    "note that our spectrum does not show a trace of such a hot companion ; spectra reaching further into the blue - violet are required to detect this .",
    "v143=sao100195 is an a0 m star , for which we found [ faust  v]=4.42 .",
    "am stars are those `` a or early f stars for which no unique spectral type can be assigned '' ( jaschek and jaschek 1987 ) .",
    "the color we measured is much redder than expected for `` regular '' a0 stars , which have colors near 0.0 ; in absence of interstellar reddening , which is not expected at the galactic latitude of this star , the possibilities could be either circumstellar reddening or some photospheric activity that reddens the uv  optical colors .",
    "however , table 2 shows that three other am stars ( v3 , v120 and v178 ) also have positive and fairly large [ faust  v ] color indices .",
    "it is possible that this is caused by additional metallic lines present in the uv spectrum of am stars ; this has been noted by jascheck and jaschek ( 1987 ) for the optical spectra and is probably true also in the uv .      in table 4",
    "we present the uv properties of the galaxies detected by faust with morphological types from the bst catalog .",
    "we include uv measurements from the guv experiment ( kodaira 1990 ) , from the scap balloon telescope ( donas 1987 ) , and from goddard rocket - borne telescope ( smith and cornett 1982 , labelled s+c ) . for consistency , we transformed all guv measurements into monochromatic magnitudes as explained above .",
    "note that each experiment measured a different spectral segment ; guv measured effectively at 1560 with a bandwith of fwhm=230 , scap measured at @xmath22000 and the bandpass was @xmath2200 , and the goddard imager had a 1150 wide bandpass centered near 2421 .",
    "we mentioned above that , in a number of cases , the uv emission detected by faust is extended , and from a comparison with hst foc observations only a small fraction of the uv is centrally produced .",
    "this was shown to be the case for a number of elliptical galaxies in the vc by kodaira ( 1990 ) , who compared the guv flux density with that measured by the large iue aperture .",
    "they found that , for five galaxies , the ratio of central to total uv flux ranged from 14% to more than 63% .",
    "this is confirmed here by a comparison of foc ( maoz 1995 ) and other uv observations for three of the galaxies , as mentioned above .",
    "observations by uit during the astro i and astro ii missions ( e.g. , neff 1994 , cornett 1994 ) detected complex morphologies in the far - uv emission of some galaxies . in the case of m31 and m33 ,",
    "far - uv observations found also that their central regions were bluer than their outer parts ( oconnell 1992 ) .",
    "the galactic latitude of all sources discussed here is higher than 65@xmath10 . despite this",
    ", the uv measurements could be affected by foreground galactic extinction .",
    "burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) showed that small but significant reddening may exist over the virgo cluster .",
    "we consulted the reddening catalog of burstein and heiles ( 1984 ) and found that our objects have small reddening values [ e(b - v)@xmath180.04 ] .",
    "this corresponds to a@xmath330.33 mag , using the wavelength dependence of the extinction from savage and mathis ( 1979 ) , _",
    "we corrected the faust magnitudes for extinction , using the 4@xmath11e(b  v ) values listed for the galaxies by burstein and heiles , or as appropriate for the nearmost galaxy listed by them in cases where no specific entry appeared in the list of burstein and heiles .",
    "we corrected by a@xmath29=2@xmath11 the listed value if positive , or left the uv magnitude unchanged if burstein and heiles listed a zero or negative value .",
    "the uv magnitudes , still called  faust magnitudes  and corrected for extinction , are listed in table 5 , where galaxies are discussed separately from galactic objects .",
    "the table also presents the total magnitude of the galaxy ( usually in the b band and from the bst or the rc3 catalogue ) , corrected for extinction , and adds the t - type of each and the hi flux integral fi(hi ) , from huchtmeier and richter ( 1986 ) , haynes and giovanelli ( 1986 ) , hoffman ( 1989a and 1989b ) , or hoffman ( private communication ) . in the case",
    "whenever a number of fi(hi ) values are given we adopted their straight average .",
    "the correlation between fi(hi ) and the faust uv magnitude is shown in figure 5 .",
    "we find a correlation coefficient of 0.74 when regressing @xmath35 fi(hi ) against the faust magnitude , and including only spiral and irregular galaxies ( t@xmath240 ) .",
    "this has been known from other uv  hi studies ( buat 1989 ) and has been linked to a correlation between total gas content and the star formation rate ( see below ) .    in table 5 we include also the far infrared ( fir ) measurements of the same galaxies by the iras telescope .",
    "the data are mainly from the iras faint source catalog .",
    "we estimate the total fir flux as in lonsdale ( 1985 ) : @xmath36 using the 60 and 100 @xmath37 m flux densities , which are also given in table 5 .",
    "the correlation between the faust and the fir emissions is shown in figure 6 .",
    "we plot in figure 7 the distance - independent `` colors '' @xmath38 _ vs. _ [ faust  b ] . excluding three background galaxies at high",
    "( v12 , v63 , and v118 ) , which may be exceptional , we find a correlation coefficient of 0.62 .",
    "the color [ faust  b ] can be used , as done by deharveng ( 1994 ) , to compare the vc galaxies with the stellar population models of galaxies which are used for deriving the k - correction in cosmological models .",
    "deharveng compared the colors with the spectral energy distributions of coleman , wu and weedman ( 1980 ) .",
    "our study , like that by deharveng , and previously by faber ( 1982 ) and by burstein ( 1988 ) , shows that elliptical galaxies exhibit a large dispersion in their ( uv - b ) color index relative to other , late - type galaxies .",
    "thus , it is hard to establish a universal k - correction for their uv segment of the spectrum , which could be useful when studying in the optical elliptical galaxies at z@xmath82 .",
    "hence , the elliptical galaxies do not form a uniformly bright population of objects at high redshifts , making their use in optical surveys or studies of high redshifts objects problematic , due to malmquist and other selection effects .      in the background section we explained that the discovery of nearby lyman @xmath19 absorptions in the spectra of 3c273 prompted the evaluation of the metagalactic ionizing background .",
    "the presence of such absorbers in the direction of the vc and at the redshift of the cluster ( weymann 1995 , shull 1996 ) prompts us to re - evaluate the ionizing flux , based on the measured uv emission from the cluster galaxies .",
    "here we restrict the discussion to the total uv flux detected from galaxies in the direction of the vc by different uv experiments .",
    "we estimate the total number of available ionizing photons , based on published uv data of virgo cluster galaxies . as the bandpasses of observations were always _ longward _ of the lyman limit , we estimate the lyman continuum ( lyc ) photon flux by scaling the measured fluxes to the wavelength of the lyman break using the stellar population models of evolving galaxies of bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) .    each publication with uv observations of the vc",
    "provides a list of galaxies towards the virgo cluster and either a uv `` monochromatic '' magnitude or a flux density in a specific bandpass . in order to estimate the amount of diffuse uv contribution",
    "when the locations of the galaxies are not known in three - dimensional space , we _ assume _ that the uv contribution from all galaxies comes from a single point located at the cluster center .",
    "we calculate the uv contribution from each galaxy from the given flux , we scale it for the distance of each galaxy to the center of the cluster ( to account statistically for nearer and farther galaxies than the center of virgo ) , and add it to the total flux densities ( tfd ) .",
    "the reference position for the center of the virgo cluster was given by van den bergh ( 1977 ) : @xmath19=12@xmath39 25@xmath40.4 , @xmath41=+12@xmath10 40. objects for which only an upper limit is given are included as if their emission would equal this upper limit ( except for faust ) .",
    "this yields an upper limit to the total galactic uv emission of the virgo cluster .",
    "the tfd reached for the different instruments / wavebands are remarkably similar ; for the detected faust galaxies the tfd is 4.82 10@xmath42 erg sec@xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath4 , whereas for the objects listed by smith and cornett ( 1982 ) the tfd is @xmath22 10@xmath42 erg sec@xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath4 .",
    "the virgo galaxies measured by scap and listed in donas ( 1987 ) total to a tfd of 1.1 10@xmath42 erg sec@xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath4 , but only a few brighter objects are included in their list .",
    "the tfd for the guv galaxies is @xmath44 erg sec@xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath4 , close to the scap 2000 total .",
    "the tfd measured by faust is @xmath45 larger than that estimated by weymann ( 1995 ) for the 1550 flux of vc galaxies .",
    "weymann calculated the flux from the b - band luminosity of early type galaxies , compounded with a uv  v transformation derived from burstein ( 1988 ) .",
    "the difference from the faust measurement is the result of the neglect of spiral and other late types by weynmann ; these galaxies produce most of the uv flux of the vc in the faust band .",
    "we adopt the highest value of tfd from faust , and scale it to the lyman limit , using the maximal ratio of 1650 flux to lyc flux just short of the lyman limit allowed by the galaxy models of bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) , which is @xmath22 . from this , we conclude that the tfd at the lyman limit which is produced by galaxies detected at earth can be at most @xmath28 10@xmath42 erg sec@xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath4 , the equivalent of a single m@xmath29=7.2 mag star .",
    "girardi ( 1992 ) found , by analyzing loose groups , an anticorrelation between the e(b - v ) color excess of galaxies and the velocity difference with respect to the brightest group member .",
    "they interpreted this as evidence for the presence of dust within the intra - group space , which reddens the light from galaxies in the anti - earth location .",
    "similar claims , of significant amounts of dust within abell clusters , were made by karachentsev and lipovetski ( 1969 ) , bogart and wagoner ( 1973 ) , boyle , fong and shanks ( 1988 ) , and romani and maoz ( 1992 ) . in the context of the vc",
    ", a search for inter - cluster dust can be linked to the possible presence of `` almost invisible '' galaxies , which give rise to the absorption lines at the redshift of the vc in spectra of background qsos .",
    "we attempted to test this by first checking five background galaxies , with v@xmath463000 km s@xmath4 , against cluster and foreground galaxies with v@xmath473000 km s@xmath4 , hereafter called `` comparison galaxies '' ( cgs ) .",
    "the assumption here is that background galaxies , seen through the cluster , should have redder [ faust  b ] colors that the cgs of similar morphological types ( within 2 t subclasses ) , because of dust reddening .",
    "we found that there is no consistent evidence for the background galaxies being significantly redder than the cluster and foreground galaxies .",
    "we then tested the cgs against themselves , by splitting the sample into a `` near '' bin if v@xmath481100 km s@xmath4 ( redshift of the virgo core ) , but v@xmath473000 km s@xmath4 , and a `` far '' bin , with galaxies which have v@xmath491100 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the assumption here is that galaxies which belong to the cluster have their cosmological recession velocity modulated by the gravitational attraction of the cluster ( see , binggeli 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , galaxies that are between us and the vc core will be accelerated by the cluster attraction and will have , on average , velocities higher than that of the cluster core .",
    "galaxies in the vc but beyond the core will be slowed by the cluster attraction and may even have negative heliocentric velocities .",
    "although the gravitational influence of the cluster is certainly much more complex , this crude separation may show some significant result .",
    "the separation , and subsequent comparison of cluster members , compensates for such effects as `` anaemic '' spirals , stripped galaxies , and such , which should apply equally to both the `` far '' and the `` near '' sub - samples .",
    "in addition , malmquist biases in the selection of background objects should be minimized .",
    "we tested whether the `` near '' bin galaxies are bluer in [ faust  b ] than the `` far '' bin galaxies , but did not find significant differences .",
    "the conclusion is that the total amount of dust in the vc is rather small , probably negligible .",
    "a similar result for a sample of clusters was obtained recently by maoz ( 1995 ) , from a study of the ( v  i ) color distribution of qsos beyond the clusters .      in the context of the three - dimensional distribution of galaxies in the direction of the vc",
    "it is interesting to test the distribution of uv - emitting objects .",
    "one finding , emphasized here as well as by deharveng ( 1994 ) , is that uv - emitting galaxies are mainly of late - type .",
    "these galaxies show usually less clustering than early - type objects , such as elliptical , lenticular and sa galaxies .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that uv - bright objects will tend to line at the edges of the main clusterings , and in the voids .    in order to check the three - dimensional distribution of uv galaxies we plot in figure 8 a diagram of all detected objects .",
    "the vertical axis is the heliocentric velocity as listed by bst and the horizontal axis is the right ascension of each galaxy .",
    "it is clear that most of the galaxies detected by faust are within the redshift range of the vc and only a few are in its background .",
    "in addition , we tested the distribution of the cluster galaxies in virgocentric projected distance ( degrees from the adopted cluster center position ) , by binning the galaxies in one - degree wide rings , despite the fact that our observations cover an @xmath2elliptical shaped sky area . considering that galaxies are actually distributed in a three - dimensional volume",
    ", the distribution indicates a high over - density of uv emitting galaxies in the inner four degrees of the vc .",
    "the optical luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies in the vc has been studied by sandage , binggeli and tammann ( 1985 ) .",
    "the lf for bright galaxies is well represented by a function bounded at both bright and faint ends .",
    "the optical lf for field galaxies was studied by marzke ( 1994 ) and was fitted by single schechter functions ( schechter 1976 ) over the entire magnitude range . in the coma cluster , biviano ( 1996 ) found that the best fit is by a schechter function combined with an erlang function .",

    ", we include all our objects , instead of splitting them into morphological subclasses .",
    "we note that , for the vc s bright galaxies , sandage , binggeli and tammann found that a gaussian best represents the luminosity function . only when including the lower luminosity objects , the dwarfs , were they justified in fitting a schechter function .",
    "the gaussians fitted by sandage peak at b@xmath50=13.3 and 13.0 for spirals and e+s0 galaxies , respectively .",

    "studies of the lf of field galaxies ( efstathiou 1988 , loveday 1992 ) found less steep @xmath19 values ( 1.07 and 1.11 , respectively ) .",
    "we fitted a gaussian distribution to the histogram of faust galaxies of the vc , and allowed the peak , the average , and the width of the gaussian to change .",
    "a best fit was estimated by minimizing @xmath51 , where the average uv@xmath50=12.37 and the full width at half - maximum of the gaussian was 2.02 mag .",
    "we presented a comprehensive study of three uv faust images in the direction of the virgo cluster of galaxies .",
    "we detected 191 uv sources and identified them , through comparison with catalogued optical sources , with ( mostly ) early - type stars or galaxies .",
    "we showed that , within the completeness limit of faust observations , the uv stellar distribution follows that predicted by our uv sky model .",
    "am stars were shown to be uv  faint , in comparison to normal stars of the same spectral sub - class .    for galaxies , we confirmed that significant uv flux is emitted outside the central regions .",
