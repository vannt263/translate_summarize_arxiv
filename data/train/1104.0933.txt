    "under the influence of gravity , disk galaxies are expected to assemble in an `` inside - out '' fashion : stars form first from high - density gas in the central region of the galaxy where the potential is deepest , and subsequently at increasing galacto - centric radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an immediate consequence of this formation scenario is that stars born at the same time and in the same region of a galaxy should have similar chemical compositions .",
    "however , observations in our galaxy suggest that these initial conditions are not maintained .",
    "@xcite argued that the sun was substantially more metal rich than nearby solar age stars and the local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "a recent recalibration of the geneva copenhagen survey ( gcs ) using the infrared flux method finds no discrepancy with solar age stars @xcite , but even modern studies confirm that the age - metallicity relationships ( amrs ) of field and solar neighborhood stars are characterized by higher dispersions than expected @xcite . in addition , simple chemical evolution models that divide the galaxy into independently evolving concentric annuli predict many more low metallicity g - dwarfs in our region of the disk compared to those observed , a discrepancy known as `` the local g - dwarf problem '' @xcite . evidence seemingly in contradiction to standard galaxy chemical evolution theory is not limited to our own galaxy .",
    "metallicity gradients in disk galaxies are shallower than predicted by classical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite find unexpectedly old stellar populations on nearly circular orbits in the outskirts of m31 and m33 , respectively .",
    "the outermost regions of ngc300 and ngc7739 show flattened or positive abundance gradients with radius @xcite .",
    "these perplexing observations can not be readily explained within the confines of classic galaxy formation models .",
    "a natural explanation for the observational challenges above arises if the present day radii of many stars could be significantly different from their birth radii .",
    "one difficulty in establishing radial migration as a common phenomenon , from a dynamical standpoint , lies in finding a mechanism that can cause a substantial fraction of stars to migrate several kiloparsecs while retaining the observed approximately circular orbits . in a seminal paper , ( *",
    "* hereafter sb02 ) investigated the relationship between changes in stellar angular momentum and disk heating .",
    "they found that radial migration is a ubiquitous process in spiral galaxies ; stars naturally migrate ( change angular momentum ) as they resonantly interact with transient spiral waves .",
    "stars in corotational resonance ( cr ) with said waves are scattered without heating the disk and maintain their nearly circular orbits ( unlike lindblad resonance ( lr ) scattering ) . in the present paper , we examine radial migration in simulations of disk galaxies .",
    "our experiments include galactic disks evolved both in isolation and under the action of infalling satellites of the type expected in the currently favored cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm of hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter set of experiments were presented in the studies of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k08 ) and @xcite and were utilized to investigate the _ generic _ dynamical and morphological signatures of galactic disks subject to bombardment by cdm substructure .    inspired by sb02 , several groups have recently investigated the potential role of radial mixing in the chemical and dynamical evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite presented the first chemical evolution model to incorporate radial migration .",
    "the rate at which stars migrate via the sb02 mechanism is left as a free parameter constrained by the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of solar neighborhood stars in the gcs @xcite .",
    "their model successfully reproduced , within systematic uncertainties , the observed age - metallicity distribution of stars in the gcs @xcite and the observed correlation between tangential velocity and abundance pattern described by @xcite .",
    "however , there is partial degeneracy between the magnitude of radial migration and other parameters in the model such as star - formation rates and gas inflow characteristics .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear whether the level of migration required to fit the data is consistent with theoretical expectations .",
    "numerical simulations have confirmed the occurrence of radial migration under a variety of conditions .",
    "@xcite studied the migration of stars in a simulation of an isolated milky way ( mw)-sized stellar disk formed from the cooling of a pressure - supported gas cloud in a @xmath3 dark matter halo . in their simulations ,",
    "some older stars radially migrated to the outskirts of the disk while maintaining nearly circular orbits , forming a population akin to that observed in m31 and m33 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath4 of all stars in the solar neighborhood were not born _ in situ _ ; this is a natural explanation for the observed dispersion in the amr and solar neighborhood metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated radial migration in a stellar disk perturbed by a low - mass ( @xmath5 ) orbiting satellite .",
    "their numerical simulations integrated test particle orbits in a static galactic potential and highlighted the fact that mergers and perturbations from satellite galaxies and subhalos can induce stellar radial mixing .",
    "although informative , test particle simulations in a static isothermal potential will not capture all the relevant physics of the process of stellar radial migration in disk galaxies ; the interactions between the gravitational perturbations and the self - gravity of the disk are essential to a detailed analysis of the phenomenon . in our paper",
    ", we expand on the analysis of @xcite by investigating radial migration using fully self - consistent numerical simulations both with and without satellite bombardment .",
    "there are now several established phenomena that can cause a star to populate a region of the disk different from its birth radii .",
    "stars on elliptical orbits maintain their guiding center and angular momentum ( modulo asymmetries in the potential ) but can be found over the range in galacto - centric radius defined by their pericenter and apocenter . changing a star s angular momentum , and hence its guiding center ,",
    "requires direct scattering or a resonant interaction with transient patterns in the disk .",
    "the local encounters of stars with molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or lindblad resonance ( lr ) scattering between stars and spiral waves ( e.g.  sb02 ) both change stellar guiding centers ( albeit to a relatively small degree ) and increase the random motions of stars over time , `` blurring '' the disk .",
    "stars scattered at cr with spiral waves can change their guiding centers by several kiloparsecs without increasing the amplitude of their radial motion . for any single spiral wave , sb02 predict that stars are scattered on each side of the cr , `` churning '' the contents of the disk .",
    "stars may undergo several encounters with transient spiral waves throughout their lifetimes . while sb02 investigate all resonant interactions between spiral waves and stars",
    ", we will refer to this special case of cr as the `` sb02 mechanism '' .",
    "as sb02 note , migration due to spiral waves can be described by blurring and churning regardless of how the waves arise ( satellites , e.g. , could induce spiral structure that would lead to migration described by sb02 ) .",
    "simulations have shown that other transient wave patterns internal to a galaxy , such as those resulting from bar propagation , can produce resonance overlap with existing spiral patterns and induce radial migration @xcite .",
    "orbiting satellites , external to the galaxy and discussed above , will have a complex interaction with the disk as they provide a means of direct scattering over a large area and also induce spiral modes in the disk . in this work",
    ", we aim to characterize radial migration induced by satellite bombardment and compare its effects on the stellar disk with those observed in secularly evolved galaxies .",
    "our investigation complements earlier and ongoing radial migration studies .",
    "we perform a simulation campaign , including numerical experiments of isolated disk galaxies with different scale heights and gas fractions , which in turn lead to different levels of spiral structure . for the first time",
    ", we examine the effect of satellite bombardment on radial migration utilizing simulations where galactic disks are subjected to a cosmologically motivated satellite accretion history . via a comparative approach ,",
    "we determine how the magnitude and efficiency of radial migration depend on input physics , establish correlations between orbital parameters and migration , and present evidence that each of the three migration mechanisms is distinct in the examined parameter space .",
    "these characteristics lead to possible observational signatures that may constrain the relative importance of each migration mechanism in the milky way .",
    "we employ the method of @xcite to construct numerical realizations of self - consistent , multicomponent disk galaxies .",
    "these galaxy models consist of an exponential stellar disk , a hernquist bulge @xcite , and a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) dark matter halo .",
    "they are characterized by @xmath6 free parameters that may be tuned to fit a wide range of observational data for actual galaxies including the mw and m31 .",
    "the @xcite models are derived from three - integral , composite distribution functions and thus represent self - consistent equilibrium solutions to the coupled poisson and collisionless boltzmann equations .",
    "owing to their self - consistency , these galaxy models are ideally suited for investigating the complex dynamics involved in the process of radial mixing .",
    "the @xcite method has been recently used in a variety of numerical studies associated with instabilities in disk galaxies , including the dynamics of warps and bars @xcite , the gravitational interaction between galactic disks and infalling satellites ( @xcite ; k08 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the transformation of disky dwarfs to dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the action of tidal forces from a massive host @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an overview of all relevant parameters and a detailed description of this technique .    for the majority of numerical experiments in the present study , we employ model `` mwb '' in @xcite , which satisfies a broad range of observational constraints on the mw galaxy . specifically , the stellar disk has a mass of @xmath7 , a radial scale length of @xmath8 , and a sech@xmath9 scale height of @xmath10 .",
    "we note that the adopted value for the scale height is consistent with that inferred for the old , thin stellar disk of the mw ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the equivalent exponential scale height is approximately @xmath11 pc , but the sech@xmath9 vertical distribution is more accurate .",
    "the bulge has a mass and a scale radius of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the nfw dark matter halo has a tidal radius of @xmath14 to keep the total mass finite ( k08 ) , a mass of @xmath15 , and a scale radius of @xmath16 .",
    "the total circular velocity of the galaxy model at the solar radius , @xmath17 , is @xmath18 , and the toomre disk stability parameter is equal to @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "we note that direct numerical simulations of the evolution of model mwb in isolation confirm its stability against bar formation for @xmath21  gyr .",
    "we wish to address the dependence of radial mixing in isolated disk galaxies upon initial disk thickness and the presence of gas in the galactic disk .",
    "because of their smaller `` effective '' toomre @xmath22 stability parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thinner disks are more prone to gravitational instabilities and thus yield stronger and better defined spiral structure",
    ". therefore , we might expect them to cause enhanced radial mixing compared to their thicker counterparts .",
    "similarly , because radiative cooling in the gas damps its random velocities , the presence of gas is associated with long - lived spiral structure in disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may act to increase the amount of radial mixing . correspondingly , we initialize several additional disk galaxy models .",
    "the first modified galaxy model was constructed with the same parameter set as mwb but with a scale height @xmath23 times smaller ( @xmath24 ) . except for disk thickness and vertical velocity dispersion ,",
    "all of the other gross properties of the three galactic components of this model are within a few percent of the corresponding ones for mwb .",
    "not surprisingly , being more prone to gravitational instabilities , this model develops a bar inside @xmath25 at time @xmath26  gyr .",
    "the second set of modified galaxy models are the same as mwb except for the fact that a fraction @xmath27 of the mass of the initial stellar disk is replaced by gas .",
    "thus , the resulting gaseous component is constructed with the same initial density distribution as the stellar disk . in the present study",
    ", we employ two values for the gas fraction , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the adopted methodology will be described in detail in a forthcoming paper ( kazantzidis et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "briefly , the construction of the gas disk is done by assuming that its vertical structure is governed by hydrostatic equilibrium and by computing the potential and the resulting force field for the radially varying density structure of the gas component . by specifying the polytropic index and the mean molecular weight of the gas and using a tree structure for the potential calculation ,",
    "the gas azimuthal streaming velocity is determined by the balance between gravity and centrifugal and pressure support .      in the standard cdm paradigm of hierarchical structure formation",
    ", galaxies grow via continuous accretion of smaller satellite systems . to investigate the effect of accretion events on radial mixing in galactic disks , we have also analyzed @xmath30-body simulations of the gravitational interaction between a population of dark matter subhalos and disk galaxies .",
    "these simulations were first presented by k08 , and we summarize them briefly here .",
    "k08 performed high - resolution , collisionless @xmath30-body simulations to study the response of the galactic model mwb discussed above to a typical -motivated satellite accretion history .",
    "the specific merger history was derived from cosmological simulations of the formation of galaxy - sized cdm halos and involved six dark matter satellites with masses , orbital pericenters , and tidal radii of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively , crossing the disk in the past @xmath34  gyr . as a comparison",
    ", the large magellanic cloud has an estimated _ total _ present mass of @xmath35 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the masses of the perturbing dark matter satellites correspond to the upper limit of the mass function of observed satellites in the local group .",
    "k08 modeled satellite impacts as a sequence of encounters . specifically , starting with the first subhalo , they included subsequent systems at the epoch when they were recorded in the cosmological simulation .",
    "we note that although k08 followed the accretion histories of host halos since @xmath36 , when time intervals between subhalo passages were larger than the timescale needed for the disk to relax after the previous interaction , the next satellite was introduced immediately after the disk had settled from the previous encounter .",
    "each satellite was removed from the simulation once it reached its maximum distance from the disk after crossing .",
    "this approach was dictated by the desire to minimize computational time and resulted in a total simulation time of @xmath37  gyr instead of @xmath34  gyr that would formally correspond to @xmath38 .",
    "k08 and @xcite found that these accretion events severely perturbed the galactic disk of model mwb without destroying it and produced a wealth of distinctive morphological and dynamical signatures on its structure and kinematics . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the magnitude of radial mixing induced in disk model mwb by these accretion events .",
    "as in the case of isolated disk models , it is worthwhile to examine the dependence of radial mixing upon disk thickness . for this purpose , we employed the thinner galaxy model with a scale height of @xmath24 described above and repeated the satellite - disk encounter simulations of k08 .",
    "all collisionless numerical simulations discussed in this paper were carried out with the multi - stepping , parallel , tree @xmath30-body code pkdgrav @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations were performed with the parallel treesph @xmath30-body code gasoline @xcite . in the gasdynamical experiments ,",
    "we include atomic cooling for a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium , star formation and ( thermal ) feedback from supernovae .",
    "our star formation recipe follows that of @xcite , which is based on that of @xcite .",
    "gas particles in cold and dense regions which are simultaneously parts of converging flows spawn star particles with a given efficiency @xmath39 at a rate proportional to the local dynamical time .",
    "feedback from supernovae is treated using the blast - wave model described in @xcite , which is based on the analytic treatment of blastwaves described in @xcite . in our particular applications ,",
    "gas particles are eligible to form stars if their density exceeds 0.1 atoms/@xmath40 and their temperature drops below @xmath41  k , and the energy deposited by each type - ii supernova into the surrounding gas is @xmath42  erg .",
    "we note that this choice of parameters and numerical techniques is shown to produce realistic disk galaxies in cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "lastly , in an attempt to investigate the effect of star formation efficiency on radial mixing , for each of the gas fractions @xmath27 above , we adopted two different values for @xmath39 , namely @xmath43 ( which reproduces the slope and normalization of the observed schmidt law in isolated disk galaxies ) and a lower value of @xmath44 .",
    "all @xmath30-body realizations of the disk galaxy models contain @xmath45 particles of @xmath46 in the disk ; @xmath47 , @xmath48 in the bulge ; and @xmath49 , @xmath50 in the dark matter halo .",
    "the gravitational softening lengths for the three components were set to @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "these are `` equivalent plummer '' softenings ; the force softening is a cubic spline . in the hydrodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies ,",
    "gaseous disks were represented with @xmath54 and @xmath55 for gas fractions of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . in these cases , the gravitational softening length for the gas particles was set to @xmath56 .",
    "all numerical simulations of isolated and perturbed disks were analyzed at @xmath57  gyr .",
    "this time - scale corresponds to approximately @xmath58 orbital times at the disk half - mass radius . for evaluating the impact of accretion events , it is fairest to compare isolated and perturbed disks after the same amount of integration , but we may underestimate the total amount of mixing in the isolated ( and , to a lesser extent the perturbed ) models . in the future ,",
    "we plan to evolve selected simulations for the full @xmath59 gyr interval since @xmath38 , but such simulations will require more than three times the computational resources used here .",
    "exchange of angular and linear momentum between the infalling satellites and the disk tilt the disk plane and cause the disk center of mass to drift from its initial position at the origin of the coordinate frame ( k08 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we calculate @xmath60  in the satellite - disk encounter experiments after removing the global displacement and tilt of the disk galaxy by determining the principal axes of the total disk inertia tensor and rotating our original coordinate system such that it is aligned with this tensor .",
    "figure  [ fig : sims ] presents surface density maps of the stellar distributions of our four collisionless galactic disks with different initial scale - heights @xmath61 .",
    "each simulation exhibits a distinctive combination of morphological features that could affect radial migration .",
    "the initial smooth disks are unstable to spiral instabilities arising from the swing amplification of particle shot noise , an effect that leads to emerging spiral structure as seen in the final isolated disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "owing to its smaller `` effective '' toomre @xmath22 stability parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the @xmath62 disk ( hereafter , disks with this initial scale height will be referred to as `` thin '' ) develops prominent spiral structure and a strong bar .",
    "conversely , the @xmath63 disk ( hereafter , disks with @xmath63 will be referred to as `` thick '' ) has relatively little spiral structure and does not form a bar in isolation .",
    "we emphasize that the `` thick '' , @xmath63 disk is the one in best agreement with the old , thin disk of the mw , while @xmath62 is too thin ( see section  [ sec : isolated_disks ] ) .",
    "the radial and vertical morphology of the perturbed disks is distinct from their isolated counterparts .",
    "both perturbed disks develop bars and are characterized by prominent flaring and much larger scale heights than those of the isolated disks ( k08 ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is evidence that some spiral structure evident in the isolated disks has been washed out in the simulations with substructure bombardment : within @xmath64 of the galactic center , local enhancements of the stellar surface density evident in the isolated disks are substantially more diffuse after the action of the infalling satellites . throughout this section",
    ", we will investigate how the growth and dissipation of spiral structure affect radial migration .",
    "while we have investigated similar maps in the four hydrodynamical simulations , we do not show them here as they are qualitatively similar to their collisionless counterparts . as expected , however , the magnitude of spiral structure increases as the gas fraction rises .",
    "we note that the differential effect of gas on the strength of spiral structure we find here is smaller than that reported in previous numerical investigations of isolated disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is mainly due to the effect of stellar feedback , which causes the ism in our simulations to become turbulent and multi - phase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we first investigate where particles move throughout each simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : isodisks ] shows the distribution of @xmath60@xmath65 in the six isolated disk simulations , where @xmath66  and @xmath67  refer respectively to each particle s final and initial projected distance from the galactic center .",
    "each panel contains the @xmath60  distribution , the median @xmath68 ( denoted @xmath69 ) , and @xmath70 percentile @xmath68 ( denoted @xmath71 ) for two of the six isolated galaxies in our simulation suite .    the isolated , collisionless simulations ( left panel ) clearly demonstrate that disk scale height and gas content affect the radial migration process .",
    "the thin disk s @xmath60  distribution ( black line ) is considerably broader than the thick disk s ( gray hatch ) .",
    "both @xmath69@xmath72 and @xmath71@xmath73 of particles in the thin disk are approximately double those found in the thick disk .",
    "the remaining panels of figure  [ fig : isodisks ] compare the @xmath60distributions of the hydrodynamical simulations of our sample .",
    "we examine four isolated disks with two initial gas fractions : @xmath74 ( middle panel ) and @xmath75 ( right panel ) .",
    "the two histograms in each panel represent star formation efficiencies ( @xmath39 ) of @xmath76 ( solid line ) or @xmath77 ( gray , hatched histogram ) .",
    "gas has a strong impact on particle radial migration : @xmath69  increases from @xmath78 in the collisionless case ( all hydrodynamical simulations are of `` thick '' disks ) to @xmath79 when @xmath74 and @xmath80 when @xmath75 .",
    "the extent of radial migration is less dependent on star formation efficiency ; there are only minor differences amongst each pair of histograms in the middle and right panels . however , in both panels , @xmath69  and @xmath71  are highest when @xmath39@xmath81 . in these four hydrodynamical simulations , the time - averaged gas content of the disk",
    "is directly correlated with the percentage of particles that migrate and their typical displacement relative to their formation radius .",
    "decreasing the scale height of the stellar disk , increasing the fraction of the initial disk mass in gas , and lowering the star - formation efficiency all increase the midplane density of the disk .",
    "this enhanced density increases the coherence and self - gravity of spiral structure , supporting it against the dissipative nature of individual particles random motions ( as described by , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the correlation of spiral structure strength with the fraction of particles that migrate away from their birth radii and the median migratory distance traversed suggests that the sb02 mechanism , intimately linked with spiral waves , plays a major role in the migration of particles in the isolated systems .",
    "the symmetric shapes ( to within @xmath82 about @xmath83 ) of the @xmath60  distributions are also consistent with migration via the sb02 mechanism",
    ". resonances between the bar and spiral structure could also influence the timescale for migration in the thin disk models @xcite , but the @xmath63 models do not develop bars , regardless of whether they include gas .",

    "the @xmath69  and @xmath71  of each distribution are labeled and color - coded to match the corresponding histogram . in each panel ,",
    "the most sharply peaked histogram ( red ) shows the expected @xmath60distribution from epicyclic motion alone , which we compute given the particle s initial phase space coordinates .",
    "we model the epicycle as a simple harmonic oscillator about the particle s guiding center radius ( @xmath84 ) with an amplitude set by its initial radial energy ( @xmath85 ) ( chapter 3 , * ? ? ?",
    "the energy associated with the circular component of the particle s orbit ( @xmath86 ) is set by @xmath84 , which is the radius of a circular orbit with angular momentum equal to the midplane component of the particle s angular momentum .",
    "the radial energy of the orbit is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the vertical energy component and @xmath89 is the total energy .",
    "as @xmath85 sets the amplitude of the epicycle , we can solve for the position of the particle as function of time with respect to its guiding center radius .",
    "we choose two random phases of the epicycle oscillation , designating the first as @xmath67and the second as @xmath66 , and compute @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting `` baseline '' distribution is shown in red and is a result of observing the two random phases ( akin to our `` initial '' and `` final '' snapshots ) of the initially elliptical orbits .",
    "it does not take into account the potential heating of these initial orbits and the subsequent increase in amplitude of their radial motion ( blurring ) .",
    "the shape of the distribution does not change if we change our random seed or average a larger number of phases to obtain @xmath66  and @xmath67 . for the isolated thick disk ( right panel ) ,",
    "the @xmath60  distribution from full dynamical evolution is only marginally broader than the expected baseline distribution , suggesting that these stars are not heated with time and continue to follow their initial orbits .",
    "however , satellite bombardment broadens the @xmath60  distribution dramatically , nearly doubling both @xmath69  and @xmath71 , necessitating guiding center modification of a substantial fraction of the orbits .    for the thin disk , isolated evolution produces a much broader @xmath60distribution than the baseline distribution , demonstrating the impact of the bar and spiral structure in this more unstable disk .",
    "in this case , satellite bombardment only slightly increases the width of the @xmath60  distribution , despite the strong impact on disk structure that is visually evident in figure  [ fig : sims ] .",
    "we suspect that the small net difference between these two histograms reflects a cancellation between two competing effects of satellite bombardment .",
    "accretion events heat the stellar disk and thereby suppress the development of spiral structure , thus reducing the level of sb02 migration .",
    "however , the accretion events also induce radial mixing directly via their dynamical perturbations .",
    "the @xmath60  histograms of both perturbed disks , while still approximately symmetric , are noticeably more asymmetric than those of the isolated disks , with @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) more particles moving outwards than inwards in the thin ( thick ) cases , compared to @xmath92 for the isolated models .",

    "particles with @xmath94  interior _ or _ exterior to a given @xmath66  can be found at significant distances above the plane in the perturbed disks , while increases in @xmath173  are smaller in the isolated systems and rely on particles moving outwards ( figure  [ fig : rform ] ) .",
    "our results confirm earlier findings that spiral structure development in isolated disks @xcite and perturbations by satellites @xcite can produce significant radial mixing of stellar populations while retaining reasonable orbital structure for disk stars .",
    "they strongly support the view ( @xcite ; sb02 ; @xcite ) that radial mixing is an essential ingredient in understanding the chemical evolution of the mw and disk galaxies in general .",
    "while a combination of metallicity and age can be used to estimate a star s formation radius given a chemical evolution model , the uncertainties in this approach ( including the difficulty of estimating ages for typical stars in a spectroscopic survey ) will make it difficult to reconstruct formation radius distributions for observed stars , even in the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , our analysis provides theoretical guidance for chemical evolution models that incorporate radial mixing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and suggestions for the correlations one might search for between chemical abundances and orbital properties ( though the predicted trends are fairly weak ) .",
    "we regard our perturbed @xmath63 disk as the most relevant simulation , as it includes the satellite accretion events expected in  and produces a final vertical structure similar to that measured in the mw . in this simulation @xmath217 of particles in the @xmath218 solar annulus",
    "were `` born '' in that annulus , @xmath219 migrated there from @xmath220 , and @xmath221 migrated there from @xmath222 .    radial mixing and",
    "orbital dynamics changes are sensitive to several different aspects of disk modeling , as shown by the variety of our results .",
    "robust predictions should therefore come from calculations that self - consistently include star formation , chemical enrichment , gas accretion , and accretion events , and the interplay among these elements .",
    "we will move in this direction with our future simulations .",
    "giant spectroscopic surveys such as segue , rave , apogee , lamost , and hermes offer an extraordinary opportunity to unravel the formation history of the mw , and they offer an exciting new challenge to theoretical models of galaxy formation .",

    "<S> the orbital dynamics of migrating particles are also different in isolated and perturbed disks : satellite perturbations drive particles to lower angular momentum for a given change in radius . </S>",
    "<S> thus , satellite perturbations appear to be a distinct mechanism for inducing radial migration , which can operate in concert with migration induced by bars and spiral structure . </S>",
