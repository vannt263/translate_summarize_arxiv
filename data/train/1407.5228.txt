    "graph protection involves the placement of mobile guards on the vertices of a graph to protect its vertices and edges against single or sequences of attacks and has its historical roots in the time of the ancient roman empire .",
    "the modern study of graph protection was initiated in the late twentieth century by the appearance of four publications in quick succession that referred to the military strategy of emperor constantine ( constantine the great , 274 - 337 ad ) .",
    "the seminal paper is ian stewart s defend the roman empire !  in _ scientific american _ , december 1999 @xcite , which contains a reply to c. s. revelle s can you protect the roman empire ? , _ johns hopkins magazine _ , april 1997 @xcite , and which is based on revelle and k. e. rosing s defendens imperium romanum : a classical problem in military strategy  in _ american mathematical monthly _ , august ",

    "work @xcite in turn is a response to the paper  graphing an optimal grand strategy  by j. arquilla and h. fredricksen @xcite , which appeared in _ military operations research _ in 1995 and which is the oldest reference we could find that places the strategy of emperor constantine in a mathematical setting .",
    "according to ancient history ",
    "some say mythology ",
    "rome was founded by romulus and remus in 760  750 bc on the banks of the tiber in central italy .",
    "it was a country town whose power gradually grew until it was the centre of a large empire . in the third century",
    "ad rome dominated not only europe , but also north africa and the near east .",
    "the roman army at that time was strong enough to use a _ forward defense _",
    "strategy , deploying an adequate number of legions to secure on - site every region throughout the empire .",
    "however , the roman empire s power was greatly reduced over the following hundred years . by the fourth century ad",
    "only twenty - five legions of the roman army were available , which made a forward defense strategy no longer feasible .",
    "romanmap.eps    according to e. n. luttwak , _ the grand strategy of the roman empire _ , as cited in @xcite , to cope with the reducing power of the empire , constantine devised a new strategy called a _ defense in depth _",
    "strategy , which used local troops to disrupt invasion .",
    "he deployed mobile field armies ( fas ) , units of forces consisting of roughly six legions powerful enough to secure any one of the regions of the roman empire , to stop the intruding enemy , or to suppress insurrection . by the fourth century ad",
    "there were only four fas available for deployment , whereas there were eight regions to be defended ( britain , gaul , iberia , rome , north africa , constantinople , egypt and asia minor ) in the empire .",
    "see figure [ map ] .",
    "an fa was considered capable of deploying to protect an adjacent region only if it moved from a region where there was at least one other fa to help launch it .",
    "the challenge that constantine faced was to position four fas in the eight regions of the empire .",
    "consider a region to be _ secured _ if it has one or more fas stationed in it already , and _",
    "securable _ if an fa can reach it in one step .",
    "constantine decided to place two fas in rome and another two fas in constantinople , making all regions either secured or securable  with the exception of britain , which could only be secured after at least four movements of fas .",
    "it is mentioned in @xcite that constantine s defense in depth  strategy was adopted during world war ii by general douglas macarthur . when conducting military operations in the pacific theatre he pursued a strategy of island - hopping   moving troops from one island to a nearby one , but only when he could leave behind a large enough garrison to keep the first island secure .",
    "the efficiency of constantine s strategy under different criteria , and ways in which it can be improved , were also discussed in these three articles .",
    "constantine s strategy is now known in domination theory as * roman domination*. a _ roman dominating function _ on a graph @xmath0 is a function @xmath1 satisfying the condition that every vertex @xmath2 with @xmath3 is adjacent to at least one vertex @xmath4 with @xmath5 . *",

    "a full discussion of roman domination , weak roman domination and secure domination is beyond the scope of this survey .",
    "publications covering these topics and their variations are given in the bibliography after the list of references .",
    "here we focus on securing the vertices and edges of graphs against infinite sequences of attacks , executed one at a time , by stationing defense units , henceforth called guards , at the vertices of the graph . at most",
    "one guard is stationed at each vertex , and guards that move in response to an attack do not return to their original positions before facing another attack .",
    "we refer to such models as _ eternal _ , as they can be thought of as protecting a graph for eternity .",
    "a number of different eternal protection models have been studied .",
    "we introduce them in the next section .",
    "a _ dominating set _ of a graph @xmath0 is a set @xmath12 such that each vertex in @xmath13 is adjacent to a vertex in @xmath14 .",

    "total domination number _ @xmath18 .",
    "only connected graphs have connected dominating sets , and only graphs without isolated vertices have total dominating sets .",
    "domination theory can be considered the precursor to the study of graph protection : one may view a dominating set as an immobile set of guards protecting a graph .",
    "a thorough survey of domination theory can be found in @xcite .",
    "a _ vertex cover _ of @xmath6 is a set @xmath19 such that each edge of @xmath6 is incident with a vertex in @xmath20 .",

    "_ @xmath25 of the complement @xmath26 of @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath27 for all graphs @xmath6 of order @xmath28 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the _ matching number _",
    "@xmath29 is the maximum cardinality of a matching of @xmath6 .",
    "it is also well known that @xmath30 for all graphs , and that equality holds for bipartite graphs .",
    "the latter result is known as * knig s theorem * ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * theorem 9.13 ) ) .",
    "let @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , be a collection of sets of vertices of the same cardinality , with one guard located on each vertex of @xmath34 .",
    "each protection strategy can be modeled as a two - player game between a _ defender _ and an _ attacker _ : the defender chooses @xmath35 as well as each @xmath34 , @xmath36 , while the attacker chooses the locations of the attacks @xmath37 .",
    "each attack is dealt with by the defender by choosing the next @xmath34 subject to some constraints that depend on the particular game .",
    "the defender wins the game if they can successfully defend any sequence of attacks , subject to the constraints of the game described below ; the attacker wins otherwise .",
    "we say that a vertex ( edge ) is _ protected _ if there is a guard on the vertex or on an adjacent ( incident ) vertex .",

    "thus we define the _ eternal total _ ( _ connected _ , respectively ) _ domination number _ @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , respectively ) and the _ m - eternal total _ ( _ connected _ , respectively ) _ domination number _ @xmath50 ( @xmath51 , respectively ) in the obvious way .",

    "we conclude this section with some remarks about the nature of the attack sequence @xmath57 .",
    "there are three main ways for the attacker to choose and reveal @xmath57 . following the notation used for the @xmath58-server problem ( see section [ sec_k - server ] ) , they are as follows .    1 .",
    "* offline problem * : the entire sequence @xmath59 of attacks is chosen and revealed in advance .",
    "* adaptive online problem * : the sequence of attacks is chosen and revealed one by one by the attacker alternating with the guard movements by the defendant .",
    "the attacker is called an _",
    "adaptive adversary_. 3 .",
    "* oblivious online problem * : the sequence of attacks is constructed in advance by an adversary , but revealed one by one in response to each guard movement . the adversary in this case is called an _",
    "oblivious adversary_.    the offline problem , even if the finite sequence @xmath59 is repeated indefinitely , is not the same as eternal domination problem .",
    "the minimum number of guards required to defend such a predefined attack sequence could be strictly less than the eternal domination number .",
    "we only consider this type of attack sequence for the @xmath58-server problem in section [ sec_k - server ] .",
    "the adaptive online problem is precisely the eternal domination problem as described above : the location of each attack is chosen by the attacker depending on the location of the guards at that time . at first glance",
    ", the oblivious online problem appears to be somewhat different from the adaptive online problem , and to be the same as the original eternal domination problem described in @xcite .",
    "however , the defender is required to defend against _ any _ attack sequence and has no advance knowledge of the sequence .",
    "furthermore , one can assume the attacker is aware of the defense strategy ; and so the attacker can predict the moves of the defender unless the defender employs a randomized strategy . because randomized strategies are not relevant for the types of results described in this paper , for our purposes , the two types of attack models are equivalent . certainly , the associated parameters are equal .",
    "randomized strategies are relevant when one asks questions that might concern the number of ( expected ) moves before some configuration is reached , for example .",
