    "a promising area for the study of zero - temperature quantum phase transitions is that of quantum spin systems in noncommuting applied magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "such noncommuting terms introduce quantum fluctuations into the @xmath7 ground state which , for large enough fields , can completely disorder the system .",
    "such a situation has been studied in considerable detail in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising ferromagnet lihof@xmath8 in a transverse magnetic field @xcite . however , due to its high dimensionality , the system behaves in a mean - field like way . in this paper",
    "we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum magnet and the effects of a noncommuting field on its ground state .",
    "the scenario that we investigate experimentally is that of the 1d spin-1/2 xxz model ( @xmath9 ) in a noncommuting field ( @xmath10 ) , given by the hamiltonian , @xmath11 where , @xmath12 and @xmath13 and where @xmath14 is the antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange constant , and @xmath15  is the anisotropy parameter ( a @xmath16 factor is incorporated in the magnetic field @xmath17 ) .",

    "it is that of a 1d noninteracting fermi gas as shown by the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "the effect of a field along @xmath28 , @xmath29 , ( commuting ) is trivial ; it acts as a chemical potential and changes the filling level of the fermions in the chain inducing magnetization along @xmath28 . below a critical field , @xmath30 ,",
    "representing the field of complete saturation of the chain , the excitation spectrum remains gapless and the @xmath7 correlation functions fall algebraically as power laws . in contrast , the physics for the case of a field along @xmath31 , @xmath32 @xmath33 , is neither trivial nor widely known .",
    "the action of noncommuting field @xmath34 on @xmath35 has been considered theoretically by kurmann _",
    "_ @xcite . from these studies",
    "it was found that the in - plane field has two effects :  1 )  it breaks the u(1 ) symmetry of the xy - model to a lower , ising - like , symmetry which causes the ground state to long - range order ( lro ) at @xmath7 into a spin - flop type nel state .",
    "in fact at a special coupling , @xmath36 the spin - flop nel state is the exact @xmath7 ground state .",
    "2 )  the second effect is to introduce quantum fluctuations into the system . at high fields",
    "this causes a phase transition to occur where the fluctuations become large enough to destroy the lro altogether .",
    "this disordering field is below that where the system reaches its saturation point .",
    "this phase transition is therefore a nontrivial quantum phase transition through a quantum critical point with the noncommuting field as a control parameter .",
    "[ fig_theoretical_phase_diagram ] shows a schematic outline of the physics of the xy - model in a transverse field .",
    "the theoretical studies @xcite suggest that this behavior is generic to a wide class of magnets in noncommuting fields , and a disordered spin - liquid ( s.l .",
    ") phase is expected for all @xmath37 in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "spin liquid phases such as this are generally gapped ( evidenced by the exponentially decaying correlations in the zero - temperature ground state ) and therefore robust against small perturbations .",
    "we therefore expect the effects of nonzero @xmath38 and interchain coupling to modify the transition fields in fig .",
    "[ fig_theoretical_phase_diagram ] but not to change its qualitative content .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed study of the ground state ordering of the quasi-1d xy - like antiferromagnet @xmath39 in noncommuting fields from zero to well above saturation .",
    "the crystalline and magnetic properties of @xmath39 and the experimental tool of neutron diffraction will be introduced in section  [ sec_experiment ] .",

    "the structure is that of magnetic chains which are ordered antiferromagnetically along their lengths with ordered moments lying in the ( @xmath40,@xmath41 ) plane .",
    "the experimental results show that an applied field initially further stabilizes the ordered structure ( spin - flop phase ) , but as the field increases fluctuations induced by field noncommutation cause a sharp transition to a new phase which we propose to be the spin - liquid phase discussed above .",
    "study of the ferromagnetic component ( [ subsec_ferromagnetic_moment ] ) confirms that the saturation field is higher still , and that the proposed spin liquid phase exists in the region @xmath42 tesla @xmath5@xmath6 .    an extended discussion of our results is given in section  [ sec_disc ] .",
    "the observation of commensurate order ( @xmath43=(0,1/2,1/2 ) ) in @xmath44 is related to the effective ising - type interchain coupling ( [ subsec_commensurate ] ) and compared with the quasi - elastic results of yoshizawa _",

    "a small lambda - type anomaly observed in the specific - heat at @xmath50 was interpreted@xcite as indicating a phase transition to a magnetically ordered phase caused by small couplings between chains . the in - plane magnetic susceptibility @xcite also indicated magnetic ordering below @xmath51 and the temperature dependence between @xmath52 and @xmath53 was in excellent agreement with numerical calculations for af xxz chains with @xmath54 in eq  [ eq_hamil_cscocl ] .",

    "interestingly , the critical scattering is driven partly to incommensurate positions due to competing inter - chain interactions .",
    "those earlier diffraction experiments @xcite concentrated on the critical scattering at temperatures above the ordering transition of @xmath57 inferred by macroscopic measurements .",

    "since the overlap of the electronic wave - functions decreases very rapidly ( approximately exponentially ) with distance , these exchange paths are expected to yield much smaller interactions than the coupling @xmath72 along @xmath40 such that @xmath44 can be regarded as a system of weakly - coupled spin chains along the @xmath40 axis .",
