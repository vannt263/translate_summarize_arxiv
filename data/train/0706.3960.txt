    "the large hierarchy between the planck scale where quantum gravity effects are important , and the scale where the electroweak symmetry is broken , drives the wealth of models at the electroweak scale , and motivates the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments . while weakly coupled supersymmetry remains a leading candidate to stabilize the hierarchy , the randall - sundrum ( rs ) models of a warped extra dimension @xcite have recently emerged as a fascinating alternative , which may be connected to string landscape solutions of the cosmological constant problem @xcite , and possess an interesting four dimensional dual interpretation in terms of the composite states of a strongly coupled nearly conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "the original rs model had all of the standard model confined to the ir brane ( appearing as composites in the dual description ) .",
    "however , the rs solution to the hierarchy problem requires only the higgs to be localized at the ir boundary , and there are compelling reasons to consider most of the sm might actually lie near the uv brane ( and thus mostly fundamental with respect to the cft in the dual description ) .",
    "theories with the sm in the bulk can incorporate grand unification of couplings @xcite , motivate the flavor hierarchy of fermion masses @xcite , and incorporate a dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "however , such theories face significant challenge from precision electroweak observables @xcite , requiring specific features @xcite in order to remain natural .    at the lhc ,",
    "production of colored states is usually dominant , and the kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the gluons are particularly attractive , because they are singly produced and thus have larger rates than the kk quarks .",
    "thus , they are usually considered to be likely to be the first signs of warped physics , and the first excitation of the gluon ( @xmath3 ) the state for which we will have the most statistics available in order to unravel the details of the underlying theory .",
    "they are the natural place to explore whether or not we can use lhc data to determine which particular detailed rs model has been realized in nature , and which parameters describe it . recently",
    ", significant work has begun on some of the simplest rs constructions to study the production and decay of the first kk mode of the gluon , in order to determine the reach of the lhc to discover rs through its detection @xcite .",
    "while the kk gluon is the most promising avenue to discover rs , it is nevertheless challenging .",
    "the coupling to the light quarks that are the primary constituent of the proton , while characterized by the strong coupling , are somewhat suppressed by the localization of the light fermions close to the uv boundary ( in the cft language , the light fermions are largely fundamental fields and couple to the gluon largely through a small mixing with cft states ) .",
    "this leads to somewhat smaller production cross sections than are typical of qcd .",
    "the decay of the gluon is expected to be predominantly into top quarks , a consequence of the large top mass , which necessitates that top is itself located close to the ir brane ( mostly composite ) .",
    "the tops are produced from a very heavy resonance , and are highly boosted , which makes it experimentally challenging to reconstruct them from the large qcd backgrounds @xcite .    in this article , we explore several more of the commonly considered theories which attempt to render rs consistent with precision electroweak data .",
    "we consider the model with a simple @xmath7 @xcite custodial symmetry ( already studied before @xcite ) as a beginning , and also consider models with large brane kinetic terms @xcite or an expanded custodial symmetry which protects the @xmath8-@xmath9-@xmath10 vertex from large corrections @xcite in order to characterize the difference in the properties of the first kk mode of the gluon in each case .",
    "we find that there are general features which can discriminate between the cases , and thus that the specific realization of the rs model leaves an imprint in the properties of the kk gluon .",
    "the article is laid out as follows : in section  [ sec : models ] , we review the specific details of the models under consideration . in section  [ sec :",
    "xsec ] we show the @xmath3 production rates and decay properties and show how the strong coupling can lead to interesting finite width effects in section  [ sec : interfere ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the basic rs model is a slice of ads@xmath11 with the background metric @xmath12 , \\label{metric - conf}\\ ] ] with curvature @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 are the coordinates of the four large dimensions , @xmath15 parameterizes the coordinate along the extra dimension , and @xmath16 is the four - dimensional metric .",
    "greek letters denote the four large dimensions @xmath17 and capital roman letters include the fifth dimension as well .",
    "the uv boundary is at @xmath18 where the scale factor @xmath19 and the ir boundary is at @xmath20 , as motivated by the hierarchy problem .",
    "we are particularly interested in a model where all standard model ( sm ) fields , except perhaps the higgs , propagate in the entire 5-d spacetime , and will be primarily concerned with the gluon and colored fermion fields .",
    "the action for the gauge fields and fermions is , s = d^5x \\{- f_mn^af^mn a + i ^ e_^m d_m + i c } .",
    "[ eq : action0 ] where @xmath21 are the 5d ( @xmath22 ) dirac matrices , @xmath23 is the veilbein , @xmath24 is an adjoint gauge index and @xmath25 parameterizes the magnitude of a bulk mass for the fermion in units of the curvature .",
    "we work in a unitary gauge @xmath26 , and decompose the 5d fields in kk modes , a^a_(x , z ) = _",
    "n a^a(n)_(x ) g^(n)(z ) , + _ l , r ( x , z ) = ( z)^3/2 _",
    "n ^n_l , r(x ) ^(n)_l , r ( z )  .",
    "the wave functions are given by combinations of bessel functions g^(n)(z ) & = & n_n z .",
    "[ eq : kkgluon ] with normalization factor @xmath27 and admixture controlled by @xmath28 .",
    "the mass spectrum is controlled by the boundary conditions , with the masses satisfying , b_n = - = -  .",
    "[ eq : b0 ] for an unbroken gauge group , there is a zero mode with wave function @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "of particular note for the following is the fact that the light kk states have most of their support close to the ir boundary .",
    "the physics of bulk fermions was worked out in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum depends sensitively on the bulk mass term @xmath25 . to remove unwanted light degrees of freedom ,",
    "we impose the boundary conditions such that either the right- or the left - chiral zero mass component is projected out . the kk states form left- and right - chiral pairs whose wave functions are also bessel functions , ^(n ) _ ( z ) = n_n ( z ) , [ eq : fermion ] where @xmath31 are for the right- ( left- ) chiral modes , and the masses are determined by imposing the equality , _ n & = & =  , and @xmath32 is a normalization factor .",
    "the zero mode wave functions are , ^(0)(z ) = n_0 ( z ) ^1/2- c _  .",
    "these wavefunctions assume the right - handed zero mode is the one allowed by the boundary conditions ; the left - handed case is given by @xmath33 .",
    "the zero mode is exponentially peaked toward the uv boundary for @xmath34 and toward the ir for @xmath35 . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we adopt a notation where @xmath25 s explicitly refer to right - chiral fields , so the left - chiral fermions should be understood to actually have @xmath36 as their mass parameter .    assuming @xmath37 5d yukawa couplings , the hierarchy in the effective 4d yukawa couplings can be motivated by the exponential suppression of the wave functions at the ir boundary for order one differences in @xmath25 . in particular",
    ", one can not allow strong suppression of the top quark wave functions on the ir boundary , because to reproduce the observed top mass one would have to adjust the 5d yukawa coupling to be too strong to have a perturbative description .",
    "there is further motivation from precision electroweak data @xcite , which prefers the light fermion mass parameters to be close to @xmath38 ( including the left - handed top , as it comes along with the left - handed bottom , leading to tension in the choice of @xmath25 for @xmath39 ) in order to cancel the leading contribution to the @xmath40 parameter from the weak boson kk modes . with this setup , and the additional suppression of the @xmath41 parameter from a custodial @xmath7 , masses of the kk modes of around @xmath42 tev",
    "are roughly consistent with precision measurements .    specifically , we consider @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and all others @xmath45 .",
    "as we will see shortly , the physics we study does not depend strongly on @xmath25 once it is @xmath46 , so the specific values for light fermions are not important .",
    "the choices of @xmath25 specify the fermion zero mode wave functions , and we compute the couplings of the first kk gluon to the fermion zero modes as the integral over the wave functions .",
    "the light quarks all have very similar couplings of roughly @xmath47 , the third family left - handed quarks @xmath48 , and the right - handed top quark @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the strong coupling constant which characterizes the coupling of the gluon zero mode .",
    "an alternate way to render precision electroweak data consistent with low kk mode masses is to include large - ish kinetic terms for the gauge fields on the ir brane @xcite .",
    "such terms repell the kk mode wave functions from the brane , and have a large effect on the phenomenology of the kk modes @xcite .",
    "brane terms are a class of higher dimensional operators of the 5d theory , - d^5x \\ { f_mn^af^mn a } 2 r_ir ( z - z_v ) [ eq : actionbk ] and will be induced by the orbifold boundary conditions and localized fields @xcite .",
    "their magnitude @xmath51 is a free parameter of the effective theory .",
    "while the size of the ir boundary kinetic term for the gluon is not closely connected to the quality of the electroweak fit , one would expect that if the uv physics is such that there are large ir kinetic terms for the electroweak bosons , such terms are probably also large for the gluon as well .",
    "thus , if one could infer the presence of large gluon terms , it would at least suggest that a similar term is present in the electroweak sector , and responsible for the success of the sm in explaining the electroweak fit",
    ".    the ir boundary kinetic term does not affect the form of the bulk wave functions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kkgluon ] ) .",
    "the boundary conditions become b = - = - , [ eq : eigenmassbk ] indicating different admixture of the bessel functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the solutions .",
    "while there is no analytic solution for the masses , they may be easily obtained numerically . in figure",
    "[ fig : bkm ] , we show the variation of the first kk mode gluon mass and coupling to uv - localized states as a function of the magnitude of the ir brane term @xmath54 . in figure",
    "[ fig : gffbkcoup ] , we show the dependence of the coupling on @xmath25 for a few different choices of @xmath54 .",
    "the inclusion of the boundary terms ameliorates the strongest constraints from precision electroweak data , and opens up considerably more freedom to choose the fermion @xmath25 s .",
    "however , in computing properties below , we imagine a situation in which the @xmath25 s are as in the @xmath7 custodial version outlined above ( for example , to explain the flavor hierarchies ) , with large contributions to the electroweak @xmath41-parameter controlled by the ir boundary kinetic terms .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have investigated the structure of the kk gluon resonance in several variants of the rs model .",
    "we find that this structure contains information that will help to distinguish between models even in the absence of data from the electroweak sector .",
    "the width and branching ratios will constrain the location of the fermion zero - modes as well as the number of light kk modes into which the kk gluon can decay . in addition , the ratio of cross - sections for producing the @xmath0 directly and in association with a @xmath9-jet will give specific information about the localization of the third generation quarks . specifically , a large coupling to @xmath55 will prefer a model where the @xmath56 vertex is protected by an extended custodial symmetry . in some models , with large boundary kinetic terms , the @xmath3 can primarily decay into dijets , and it seems promising that in such models one can discern @xmath3 against the large qcd background up to masses somewhat larger than 4 tev .",
    "finally , we find that the relative sign of the coupling to light quarks and to tops can be measured in the interference with @xmath57-channel gluon exchange .",
    "this provides an important consistancy check on the overall picture of the fermion geography and the mechanism by which flavor hierarchies are realized in the fermion yukawa couplings .",
    "the discovery of @xmath3 is an important first step in the discovery of rs , and further observables such as its production rate , associated rate with bottom quarks , total width and branching ratios , and interference with sm @xmath4 production , can yield information about the nature of the the rs construction , and the parameters which describe it .",
