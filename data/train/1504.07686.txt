    "the duration of the reionization process is constrained by the polarization of the microwave background due to thomson scattering by electrons in the ionized era ; recent data from the planck satellite and results derived from the abundance and luminosity distribution of the @xmath14 galaxy population now suggest reionization was a rapid process which extended over @xmath15 @xcite .    while @xmath3 emission ( @xmath4 1216  ) has proven to be the most valuable spectroscopic indicator for faint star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "spectrophotometric standard stars were observed twice a night in similarly good conditions .",
    "we scaled a vega model to each standard star to determine a wavelength - dependent flux calibration using the procedure described in @xcite , which more accurately traces telluric corrections free from stellar absorption features .",

    "no convincing line was seen for any of the 7 ciii ] candidates .",
    "we thus seek to determine the likely range of fluxes and equivalent widths ( ew ) for ciii ] consistent with our non - detections .",
    "in other words , we estimate the probability of detecting at least one ciii ] line in our survey , as a function of a given mean total flux and ew .",

    "[ fig2 ] . for each doublet line , and for each redshift step , we checked if its input flux would exceed a certain detection significance ( @xmath56 ) in the corresponding wavelength in the observer frame , where @xmath57 is a chosen signal / noise ratio . for a fixed line flux ,",
    "the likelihood of having a detection with @xmath58 significance in the examined slit @xmath59 is given by the number of spectral pixels with positive detections over the total number of pixels , weighted by the redshift probability function @xmath36 .",
    "the relevant expression for slit @xmath59 can be formulated as : @xmath60 where the sum is over all the redshift steps @xmath61 ( @xmath62 to @xmath38 in 0.001 increments ) , and @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 and we define @xmath65 for @xmath61 steps placing the line outside the mosfire @xmath33 band .",

    "one of the two ciii ] lines for a given target @xmath59 with redshift probability distribution @xmath67 , given the limiting noise in our spectra for the mask , @xmath68 ( see  2 ) , and as a function of the input line flux @xmath69 and the detection significance @xmath57 .",
    "finally , the probability of detecting at least one line of a given flux @xmath69 over the entire sample is : @xmath70 where the product is over all slits .",
    "we repeat the above process also in terms of restframe ew , where in each iteration , instead of running over a range of input fluxes , we run over a range of restframe ews , translated in each iteration , for each object individually , to the corresponding input flux .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the probability , for both 3 and 5 @xmath45 detections , of finding at least one line in our a2744 survey as a function of the mean total ciii ] flux and rest - frame ew .",
    "for example we have a 95% chance of detecting at least one ciii ] line in our mosfire survey at 5@xmath45 significance , if the typical ciii ] @xmath41907   line flux is @xmath71 ergs @xmath7 sec@xmath8 ( total doublet flux of @xmath72 ergs @xmath7 sec@xmath8 ) , or equivalently , if the rest - frame ew for the combined ciii ] doublet is @xmath73   or higher . in this estimate",
    "we have included limits from the shallower exposures on a2261 and m0416 , but the results remain similar ( to within typically 5% ) if the sample is restricted to a2744  for which photometric redshift errors are typically smaller and the observations are significantly deeper .",
    "errors were propagated assuming our adopted @xmath74 uncertainty in the flux calibration .    for comparison",

    "the total ciii ] restframe ews of these detections are @xmath82   and @xmath83  respectively . while our observational limits are deep enough to recover similar line fluxes to those found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , our galaxies are fainter ( @xmath84 ab ) , so that our limits on the rest - frame ews are less constraining .",
    "assuming a ciii ] ew of 22.5(7.6 )   as was found by stark , we have @xmath85 chance for detecting at least one such line in our sample with 3@xmath45 , or @xmath86 for 5@xmath45 .",
    "thus , it is quite likely that the primary reason for the non - detection in our survey is that , on average , the present sample is significantly fainter than those targeted by stark et al . , which also had the benefit of secure ly@xmath87-based redshifts .",
    "the main conclusion of our limits seen in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] is that even with a more ambitious spectroscopic campaign that would likely increase the exposure time by a factor @xmath884 ( corresponding to a 3 night integration on one mask ) , only more luminous @xmath177 - 8 galaxies in the reionization era would appear to be amenable for study with any reliability .",
    "alternatively , brighter and/or more highly - magnified examples , such as those close to the critical line of a foreground cluster , might provide promising targets although generally such sources are rare .",
    "it is interesting to note the non - detection ( and upper limit ) on ciii ] emission recently claimed by @xcite for a brighter source with @xmath33=24.7 , magnified by @xmath89 at @xmath30=7.5 , showing that even for significantly brighter objects ciii ] detection can be challenging .",
    "searching for bright magnified dropouts in a very large sample of clusters , for example , is desirable for progress with current facilities and might help deliver jwst with first light targets .    for completeness , we also calculate the limit on the civ @xmath0 ( 1548,1550 )  doublet for the @xmath90 multiply - imaged object discovered by @xcite behind a2744 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "@xcite found prominent civ emission in some of the @xmath91 galaxies they targeted , and highlighted civ as an additional promising diagnostic for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "typically they found civ line fluxes only a factor of about 2 weaker than those of ciii ] . at the proposed redshift of the @xcite object , the doublet would be readily resolved and we assume both lines have equal strength .",
    "in this case , we determine that , with @xmath92 confidence , the line flux for either one of the two civ lines for a detection significance of 5@xmath45 is less than @xmath93 ergs @xmath7 sec@xmath8 , and the rest - frame ew less than @xmath94  .",
    "this translates to a magnification - corrected , total civ luminosity of @xmath95 erg sec@xmath8 at @xmath96",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate further the properties of civ emission in a larger sample .",
    "note also @xcite have now detected a promising a civ @xmath97  line in a @xmath98 object , corresponding to a restframe ew of @xmath99  ( a total civ restframe ew of 38  ) .",
    "as in the ciii ] case , despite reaching deep enough to detect a similar line flux , @xmath100",
    "ergs @xmath7 sec@xmath8 , in terms of ew the non - detection is consistent with the limits obtained from the single @xmath101 object .",
    "given the attenuation of ly@xmath87 by neutral gas in the reionization era , the ciii ] doublet has been proposed as a promising route toward spectroscopic verification and study of high - redshift candidates @xcite .",
    "we report results from a short campaign with keck / mosfire to assess the prospects of detecting ciii ] lines in a sample of faint gravitationally - lensed @xmath102 galaxies where @xmath3 is not seen and thus the search window in wavelength is much larger than in earlier work .",
    "we observed 14 high-@xmath30 candidates magnified by three galaxy clusters .",
    "for our deepest field ( a2744 , with 7 ciii ] candidates ) , we reached a 5@xmath45(3@xmath45 ) flux limit of @xmath103 ergs @xmath7 sec@xmath8 but did not detect any convincing line . using a statistical method employing data from our collective campaign , we provide upper limits on the typical ciii ] line flux and its rest - frame ew .",
    "although our limits reach the line fluxes observed in some actual ciii ] detections claimed in the recent literature , because our sample is significantly fainter in apparent magnitude , we only marginally reach the expected ews based on these recent detections .",
    "this demonstrates the challenge of continuing the present investigation with current observing facilities unless either ( i ) brighter or more strongly - lensed sources are targeted and/or ( ii ) the ciii ] is found to be more prominent in intrinsically - fainter systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
