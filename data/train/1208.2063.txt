    "central to this paper is the problem of inverse scattering from thin curve - like electromagnetic inclusion(s ) embedded in a homogeneous domain .",
    "generally , the main purpose of inverse scattering problem is to identify characteristics of the target of interest , e.g. , shape , location , and material properties from measured scattered field data . among them",
    ", shape reconstruction of extended electromagnetic inhomogeneities with small thickness or perfectly conducting cracks is viewed as a difficult problem because of its ill - posedness and nonlinearily but this attracted the attention of researchers because this problem plays a significant role in many fields such as physics , medical science , and non - destructive testing of materials .",
    "consequently , various shape reconstruction algorithms have been reported .",
    "however , most of these algorithms are based on newton - type iteration scheme , which requires addition of a regularization term , complex evaluation of frchet derivatives at each iteration step , and _ a priori _ information of unknown inclusion(s )",
    ". however , shape reconstruction via the iteration method with a bad initial guess fails if the above conditions are not fulfilled .    on account of this ,",
    "various non - iterative shape reconstruction algorithms have been developed , such as multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm @xcite , topological derivative strategy @xcite , and linear sampling method @xcite .",
    "recently , multi - frequency based subspace migration imaging algorithm was developed for obtaining a more accurate shape of unknown inclusions .",
    "related articles can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , studies have applied this algorithm heuristically and therefore certain phenomena such as appearance of unexpected ghost replicas can not be explained .",
    "this gave the main impetus for this study to explore the structure of multi - frequency imaging algorithm .",
    "in this paper , we carefully analyze the structure of multi - frequency subspace migration imaging functional by establishing a relationship with the bessel functions of integer order of the first kind .",
    "this is based on the fact that measured boundary data can be represented as an asymptotic expansion formula in the existence of extended , thin inclusion(s ) .",
    "we proceed to explore certain properties of imaging functional and find conditions for good imaging performance .",
    "we finally propose an improved imaging functional weighted by power of applied frequencies for producing better results .",
    "we carry out a structure analysis of imaging functional , explore a condition of imaging performance , discuss certain properties , and present numerical examples to show its feasibility .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce the two - dimensional direct scattering problem and an asymptotic expansion formula for a thin electromagnetic inclusion , and then review the multi - frequency subspace migration imaging functional presented in @xcite . in section [ sec:3 ] , we discover and specify the structure and properties of the existing multi - frequency subspace migration imaging functional .",
    "we then design an improved imaging functional weighted by several applied frequencies and analyze its structure in order to investigate its properties . in section [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "various numerical examples are exhibited and discussed in order to verify our theoretical results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:5 ] , conclusion of this paper is presented .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that although the constructed shape via the proposed algorithm does not match the target shape completely , considering it as an initial guess for an iterative algorithm will be helpful for a successful reconstruction ; for details , refer to @xcite .",
    "we briefly survey two - dimensional electromagnetic scattering from a thin , curve - like inclusion in a homogeneous domain . for this purpose ,",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote a homogeneous domain with a smooth boundary and a thin inclusion , which is characterized in the neighborhood of a simple , smooth curve @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 specifies the thickness of @xmath1 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we denote @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the unit tangential and normal , respectively to @xmath2 at @xmath7 ( see figure [ figuregamma ] ) .",

    "similarly , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the permittivity and permeability of @xmath1 , respectively . at a given non - zero frequency @xmath13 ,",
    "let @xmath14 be the time - harmonic total electromagnetic field that satisfies the following boundary value problem : @xmath15 with transmission conditions on @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the set of incident directions equally distributed on the unit circle @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denotes the characteristic function of a set @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the solution of ( [ forward ] ) without @xmath1 .",
    "then , due to the existence of @xmath1 , the following asymptotic expansion formula holds .",
    "this formula will contribute to development of the imaging algorithm .",
    "a rigorous derivation of this formula can be found in @xcite .    for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the following asymptotic expansion formula holds : @xmath25 where the perturbation term @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the neumann function for @xmath0 that satisfies @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a @xmath31 symmetric matrix such that    * @xmath30 has eigenvectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , * eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "now , we apply the asymptotic formula ( [ perturbation ] ) in order to introduce the multi - frequency imaging functional . to do so",

    "based on the recent work @xcite , the number of @xmath41 and @xmath42 must be satisfying @xmath43 .    throughout this section",

    "although this fact indicates why subspace migration imaging functional produces an image of thin inclusion(s ) , a mathematical analysis is still needed for explaining some phenomena such as the appearance of unexpected ghost replicas . in the following section , we analyze the imaging functional ( [ multifrequencyimagingfunction ] ) and improve it for better imaging performance .",

    "<S> recently , a non - iterative multi - frequency subspace migration imaging algorithm was developed based on an asymptotic expansion formula for thin , curve - like electromagnetic inclusions and the structure of singular vectors in the multi - static response ( msr ) matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the present study examines the structure of subspace migration imaging functional and proposes an improved imaging functional weighted by the frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the relationship between the imaging functional and bessel functions of integer order of the first kind . </S>",
    "<S> numerical examples for single and multiple inclusions show that the presented algorithm not only retains the advantages of the traditional imaging functional but also improves the imaging performance .    </S>",
