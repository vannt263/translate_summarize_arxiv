    "interacting spin models provide a remarkably accurate description of a diverse set of physical systems , ranging from quantum magnetic materials @xcite to quantum dots @xcite , nitrogen vacancy centers @xcite , superconducting qubit arrays @xcite , ultracold atomic gases @xcite , and trapped ions @xcite . despite being relatively simple , and often admitting accurate theoretical descriptions , they support a variety of complex equilibrium properties found in real materials , e.g. emergent spatial ordering @xcite , quantum criticality @xcite , and nontrivial topological phases @xcite .",
    "while the equilibrium physics of the simplest quantum spin models is , with many notable exceptions , fairly well understood , the study of driven , dissipative , and otherwise non - equilibrium behavior is comparatively full of open questions : under what circumstances can equilibrium correlations survive coupling to a noisy environment @xcite ? to what extent do the concepts of criticality and universality extend to dynamics and non - equilibrium steady - states @xcite ?",
    "can interesting quantum - correlated states be stabilized by ( rather than degraded by ) decoherence @xcite ?",
    "in recent years , it has become increasingly apparent that non - equilibrium dynamics is ideally suited to investigation by quantum simulation @xcite , making such questions especially timely and important .",
    "moreover , there are many examples where interesting non - equilibrium states of matter are _ more readily _ achievable than low temperature equilibrium states in ultracold neutral gases @xcite , polar molecules @xcite , and trapped ions @xcite .    with these motivations in mind , in this manuscript",
    "we develop a general formalism for calculating unequal - time correlation functions of arbitrary - range ising models driven far out of equilibrium at time @xmath0 , thus establishing a comprehensive toolbox for the description of non - equilibrium dynamics in a simple context .",
    "in addition to providing a tractable example of quantum many - body spin dynamics , the ising model is realized to a good approximation in a variety of experimentally relevant systems . and ,",
    "despite its simplicity , ising spin dynamics is known to be useful for the production of entangled states with applications in quantum information and precision metrology @xcite .",
    "our results constitute a unified approach to describing experiments aimed at producing such states @xcite , and facilitate a quantitative treatment of a variety of unavoidable experimental complications , e.g. long - range ( but not infinite - range ) interactions and initial - state imperfections .",
    "ultracold atomic systems are also well suited to the controlled inclusion of dissipation , prompting a number of theoretical proposals to exploit dissipation for the creation of interesting quantum states @xcite  remarkably , such ideas are already coming to experimental fruition @xcite . verifying that these experimental systems behave in the expected manner in the presence of dissipation , however",
    ", is extremely challenging , in large part due to the numerical complexity of simulating dynamics in open quantum systems and the scarcity of exact solutions .",
    "the ising model , especially as implemented in trapped ion experiments @xcite , poses a unique opportunity to study the effects of dissipation in a controlled and , as we will show , theoretically tractable setting . in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "an important issue in the ising model is whether ground state correlations survive the application of an equilibrium coherent drive that does not commute with the interactions ",
    "i.e . a transverse field . in the dissipative ising model",
    "an analogous question can be posed : how does the system respond to being driven _ incoherently _ by processes that do not commute with the ising interaction ?",
    "our formalism for the calculation of unequal - time correlation functions allows us to definitively answer this question .",
    "quite surprisingly , non - equilibrium dynamics in the ising model remains solvable in the presence of non - commuting dissipation @xcite , even for _ completely arbitrary _ spatial dependence of the ising couplings ( and therefore in any dimension ) .",
    "this manuscript substantially extends the groundwork laid in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quantum trajectories technique was used to obtain a closed - form solution of non - equilibrium dynamics for a special class of initial states .",
    "the present work not only provides a more direct , unified , and comprehensive exposition of the relevant theory , but also generalizes those results to include a broader class of initial conditions and observables , and applies the solutions to a number of experimentally relevant problems ( most of which had previously been explored only by numerical or approximate techniques , if at all ) .",
    "we also develop a clear physical picture of the interplay between coherent interactions and spontaneous spin flips , which reveals that @xmath1 decoherence is much more detrimental to entanglement generation than might be naively expected .",
    "however , our solution also points toward a measurement - based feedback scheme that can mitigate its detrimental effects .",

    "these results will be applied to calculating bloch - vector dynamics , arbitrary equal time spin - spin correlation functions , and two - time dynamical correlation functions .",
    "these results are substantially more general than any already available in the literature @xcite , and will help quantify the quantum - enhanced precision in metrology experiments using trapped ions and ultracold neutral atomic gases . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we consider the effect of markovian decoherence on this dynamics , incorporating dephasing , spontaneous excitation , and spontaneous relaxation . because the excitation and relaxation processes do not commute with the ising dynamics , including them is especially nontrivial : we work in the interaction picture of the ising hamiltonian and incorporate them as time - dependent perturbations .",
    "terms in the perturbative expansion are evaluated using the tools laid out in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , and by summing the perturbation theory to all orders we obtain an exact ( closed - form ) description of the dissipative dynamics of arbitrary two - point correlation functions .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the behavior of a _ coherently _ driven ising model , where such a perturbative expansion can not in general be resummed .",
    "an interesting feature revealed by our exact solution is that the spin dynamics undergoes an oscillatory - to - damped transition at a critical dissipation strength , which  in the absence of a coherent drive  cannot occur at the single - particle or mean - field level .",
    "this feature , along with the more general structure of our solution , is demonstrated by solving for spin dynamics in a nearest - neighbor ising model .",
    "we conclude this section by casting our solution in terms of a clear physical picture , in which @xmath1 decoherence ( spontaneous excitation / relaxation ) , through its interplay with the ising dynamics , gives rise to an emergent non - local dephasing process .",

    "the application of @xmath123 to the wave function at time @xmath118 not only forces the @xmath79th spin to point down between times @xmath118 and @xmath36 , but also destroys the piece of the initial wave function having weight into states with @xmath124 . hence it is as if the @xmath79th spin pointed up for a time @xmath125 , and down for a time @xmath126 , thus contributing an inhomogeneous longitudinal magnetic field of strength @xmath127 ( the factor of @xmath128 arises because the @xmath10 couple to pauli matrices rather than the spin-@xmath129 matrices ) .",
    "in the previous sections we have treated our ising spins as a closed system .",
    "that is , we neglected any coupling that might exist between our system and the outside world , and thus initially pure states remained pure throughout the dynamics . in any physical realization of the ising model , this is clearly an idealization ; decoherence occurs and often must be accounted for .",
    "for example , rydberg atoms suffer from spontaneous emission @xcite , while ions couple strongly to fluctuating classical ( electric and magnetic ) fields and can decohere through off - resonant light scattering from the spin - dependent optical dipole forces used to engineer the ising interactions ( this off - resonant light scattering can produce spontaneous excitation / relaxation and dephasing ) @xcite .",
    "one way to envision dynamics in an open system is by considering the probabilistic occurrence of sudden perturbations of the system  quantum jumps  due to the system - environment coupling @xcite . as suggested in sec .",
    "[ secunequaltime ] , and as will be explained in detail below , the strategy we have developed for computing unequal - time correlation functions is well suited to describing such effects .      given a density matrix @xmath130 describing a system coupled to a reservoir , it is always possible to express the expectation value of a system operator @xmath131 in terms of the system reduced density matrix @xmath132 $ ] as @xmath133 $ ] . here",
