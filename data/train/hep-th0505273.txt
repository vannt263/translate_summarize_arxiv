    "in a wide range of nonlinear field theories , the existence of nontrivial _ static _",
    "solutions has been well established @xcite .",
    "however , nonlinear field theories can also support `` oscillons , '' also called `` breathers , '' which are localized configurations that oscillate without dissipation .",
    "exact solutions of this kind include sine - gordon breathers @xcite and @xmath1-balls @xcite .",
    "a number of numerical and approximate analyses have established the existence of long - lived breathers in theories with even less structure , such as @xmath2 theory in one dimension @xcite , @xmath2 theory in three @xcite and higher @xcite dimensions , higher dimensional sine - gordon models @xcite , and monopole systems @xcite .",
    "although oscillons are not necessarily exact solutions , they live for extremely long times  in some cases so long that sophisticated analytic arguments are needed to decide their stability @xcite because numerical experiments never see their decay . for many physics applications ,",
    "the distinction between an infinite and a very long lifetime is irrelevant .",
    "as long as the object s lifetime is significantly larger than the natural time scales of the problem , it can have significant effects on the dynamics of the theory .    in this letter",
    "we display an oscillon in the gauged @xmath0 higgs model , which is the standard model of the weak interactions neglecting electromagnetism and fermions .",
    "we set the higgs mass to be twice the gauge boson mass .",
    "we work in the spherical ansatz and numerically evolve the classical equations of motion . even after extensive runs , exceeding times of 50,000 in natural units",
    ", we have never seen this oscillon decay .",
    "we consider an @xmath0 gauge theory coupled to a doublet higgs in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath4 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath5   \\ , , \\qquad d_\\mu \\phi = ( \\partial_\\mu - i g a_\\mu)\\phi   \\ , , \\qquad a_\\mu = a_\\mu^a \\sigma^a/2   \\,,\\ ] ] and we have defined the @xmath6 matrix @xmath7 to represent the higgs doublet @xmath8 by @xmath9 we follow the conventions of @xcite , except we use the metric @xmath10 .    the spherical ansatz @xcite is given by expressing the gauge field @xmath11 and the higgs field @xmath7 in terms of six real functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath18 \\ , , \\cr \\phi(\\bm{x},t ) & = & \\frac{1}{g } [ \\mu(r , t ) + i \\nu(r , t ) { \\bm{\\sigma}}\\cdot\\bm{\\hat x } ]   \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the unit three - vector in the radial direction and @xmath20 are the pauli matrices . for the fields of the full theory to be regular at the origin , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 must vanish as @xmath26 .",
    "the theory reduced to this ansatz has a residual @xmath27 gauge invariance consisting of gauge transformations of the form @xmath28 $ ] with @xmath29 .    in the spherical ansatz",
    "we obtain the reduced lagrangian density @xmath30   \\ , , \\label{eqn : lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indices now run over @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 under the reduced @xmath27 gauge invariance , the complex scalar fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 have charges of @xmath32 and @xmath36 respectively , @xmath37 is the gauge field , @xmath38 is the field strength , and @xmath39 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the indices are raised and lowered with the @xmath40 dimensional metric @xmath41 .",
    "the equations of motion for the reduced theory are @xmath42 + \\frac{i}{2 } r^2 \\left[d_\\nu \\phi^*\\phi-\\phi^*d_\\nu\\phi\\right ] \\,,\\cr \\left[d^2+\\frac{1}{r^2}(|\\chi|^2 - 1 ) + \\frac{1}{2 } |\\phi |^2 \\right]\\chi=   -\\frac{i}{2 } \\phi^2 \\ , , \\cr \\left[d^\\mu r^2 d_\\mu+\\frac{1}{2}(|\\chi|^2 + 1 ) + \\frac{2\\lambda}{g^2}\\,r^2 \\left(|\\phi|^2-\\frac{g^2 v^2}{2}\\right )   \\right ] \\phi= i \\chi \\phi^*. \\label{redeqm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although it is described by six fields , there are only four independent degrees of freedom in the theory , consisting of the three @xmath43-bosons , each radially polarized , and the massive higgs .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom are gauge artifacts .",
    "we may fix the gauge by setting @xmath44 everywhere in space and time , and then applying a time - independent gauge transformation to set @xmath45 . for each of the four fields @xmath46 , @xmath25 , @xmath22 , and @xmath47",
    ", we must specify the profile at @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 and the time derivative of the profile at @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath13 at @xmath48 is then determined by imposing gauss s law ( the first equation in ( [ redeqm ] ) with index @xmath50 ) .",
    "configurations obeying gauss s law at the initial time will then obey it for all times .",
    "thus we have fully specified the configuration by providing initial value data for @xmath34 and @xmath35 only , reflecting the four real degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "in order to accurately simulate the extremely long lifetimes of oscillons , we require numerical techniques that are highly stable .",
    "we discretize the system at the level of the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lag ] ) .",
    "we choose a fixed radial lattice spacing @xmath51 , placing the scalar fields at the sites of the lattice and the gauge field @xmath52 on the links .",
    "thus each of the scalar fields @xmath53 is replaced by a set of functions @xmath54 , defined at each lattice point .",
    "we use a first - order lattice gauge - covariant derivative given by the replacement @xmath55   - \\xi^{\\{n\\}}(t)}{\\delta r } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the charge of the scalar field and @xmath57 labels the lattice point corresponding to radius @xmath49 .",
    "we then vary the spatially discretized lagrangian to obtain second - order accurate lattice equations of motion . in the limit of continuum time evolution",
    ", this system has exact conservation of energy and exact gauge invariance , so we can monitor these quantities to detect numerical errors and determine whether our time steps are short enough .",
    "( they do not , however , tell us whether our spatial grid is fine enough , because even for a very coarse grid our system conserves energy and is gauge invariant . ) in all our simulations , these invariants hold to an accuracy of roughly one part in @xmath58 , and we see no numerical instabilities even after extremely long runs .",
    "since we have @xmath44 , the covariant time derivative coincides with the ordinary time derivative . our time evolution is simply second - order differencing with a fixed time step @xmath59 , in which each subsequent time step is computed from the previous two .",
    "this approach is stable for @xmath60 .",
    "we note that to monitor the energy conservation and gauge invariance of the solution , it is necessary to compute first - order time derivatives .",
    "these derivatives are computed by subtracting the result at @xmath61 from the result at @xmath62 , to get a second order accurate result at @xmath63 .",
    "we found the oscillon by picking localized initial value data with zero time derivatives , and letting these configurations evolve .",
    "for some initial values , the fields dissipate completely .",
    "however , for others , much of the energy radiates away but an oscillating localized core remains . if we then start from a configuration close to this core , we can find a configuration for which relatively little energy radiates away .",
    "we work in natural units with @xmath64 . since we are considering only classical dynamics , the theory is invariant under overall rescalings of the lagrangian density . as a result , the theory is completely specified by the choice of the ratio of the higgs mass @xmath65 to the @xmath43-boson mass @xmath66 . for generic values of this ratio , we observe configurations that oscillate with extremely gradual decay . for the particular case @xmath67 , however , these oscillations exhibit no observable decay whatsoever .",
    "we choose @xmath68 and @xmath69 and start from the localized configuration @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 parameterize the configuration .",
    "the initial time derivatives are set equal to zero everywhere .",
    "we display results for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , although small changes in these parameters give similar results . in the left panel of figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the energy density as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath49 . a localized",
    ", time dependent object is clearly visible .",
    "the right panel shows that the initial configuration sheds about a quarter of its energy and quickly settles into the localized oscillon . in the upper left panel of figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the gauge invariant quantity @xmath78 .",
    "the field is clearly oscillating about the vacuum expectation value at @xmath79 .",
    "the frequency of the oscillation is measured to be @xmath80 .",
    "a general characteristic of any long - lived oscillon is that it oscillates at a frequency below the frequency of the modes that can carry energy away @xcite .",
    "note that the mass of the higgs is @xmath81 , so the lowest frequency of any propagating mode of the higgs field is @xmath82 , which is just above the oscillon frequency . in the upper right panel",
    "we show the gauge invariant quantity @xmath83 , which is oscillating with a frequency of @xmath84 .",
    "the gauge boson mass is @xmath85 , so the lowest frequency of these propagating modes is @xmath86 , which is also just above the oscillation frequency .",
    "the field @xmath87 has the same mass as @xmath88 and oscillates at the same frequency .",
    "oscillons are localized in space .",
    "going far from the origin , where we can linearize the theory , for each field we expect to find a relationship of the form @xmath89 , where the fields approach their vacuum values like @xmath90 for large @xmath49 .",
    "unfortunately , the precision with which we can estimate the @xmath91 for each field from our numerical data is very limited , so we have only checked that it agrees with the predicted value to within an order of magnitude .    in the lower panels of figure [ fig2 ] we plot the two fields over a much longer time , so the fundamental oscillations are not visible . on this scale , however , we see beats , at the same frequency in all fields . for this configuration",
    "the beat frequency is about @xmath92 , but it can vary substantially in response to variations of the initial parameters .",
    "in the model we have studied , we have numerically discovered an oscillon that shows no sign of decay after more than 14,000 oscillations .",
    "this result suggests that this object is extremely long - lived .",
    "if such a similarly long - lived object were to exist in the standard model , it would have important phenomenological consequences .",
    "it could play a significant role in the dynamics of baryogenesis by providing a mechanism for creating the necessary out - of - equilibrium conditions in the early universe .",
    "if this object were extraordinarily long - lived , it could be a dark matter candidate .",
    "( a substantial body of work has already investigated such questions for @xmath1-balls @xcite . )    however , a number of questions must be resolved in order to understand the phenomenological implications , if any .",
    "although one might expect objects with spherical symmetry to be energetically favored , it is possible that our oscillon could decay by coupling to nonspherical deformations , which we would not see because of our restriction to the spherical ansatz .",
    "restoring the photon coupling would add another possible decay mechanism .",
    "the oscillon could also decay by coupling to fermions , and such decays might be of interest in the early universe",
    ". it would be interesting to see if quantum effects modify these conclusions , as they do for small @xmath1-balls @xcite .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , we have only observed oscillons when @xmath67 , so it is possible that their unnaturally long lifetime is a consequence of this fine - tuning of parameters in our reduced theory .",
    "we imagine that in the full theory , the condition needed for the existence of the oscillon would be slightly modified by the splitting between the @xmath43 and @xmath93 masses .",
    "we note that a higgs mass near @xmath94 is in the middle of the discovery window of the lhc .",
