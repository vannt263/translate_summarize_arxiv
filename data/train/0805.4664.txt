    "the broad - line region ( blr ) is one of the main components of an unobscured agn ( ie , those where we have an unimpaired view torwards the nucleus ) , and is charactized by very broad emission lines in the uv / optical spectra ( figure 1 ) with typical widths of several thounsands km / sec due to the proximity to the central bh .",
    "one of the features of this region is that the observable uv / optical continuum flux variations are closely related to variations of the emission - lines fluxes . combining the correlation between continuum and line fluxes variations with the widths of the lines ,",
    "the mass of the central black hole can be estimated through the reverberation mapping technique ( see  2 ) .",
    "+ in these days , when it is widely accepted that all massive galaxies harbor a black hole in their centers , reverberation has allowed real physical comparison between active and dormants bhs in the local universe , but so far has not probed the high end of the agn luminosity range .",
    "+ in the next section we describe briefly the basic theory and results from previous reverberation mapping studies leading to the motivation for a high - luminosity high - redshift quasars monitoring campaign that we are performing since the beggining of 2005 .",
    "our main aim is to extend these results by two orders of magnitude , giving the firsts measurement of the largest bhs , and thus extending our knowledge of the physics of agn and their hosts into an epoch crucial for the understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "reverberation mapping is a technique based on the response of the blr gas to changes in the central continuum source .",
    "it is based on three basic assumptions :    1 .   _",
    "the ionizing continuum originates in a single central source_. + this holds because the blr size is @xmath02 orders of magnitude larger than the continuum source .",
    "the light travel time across the blr is the most important time scale . _",
    "+ which means that the clouds response is practically `` instantaneous '' . indeed , the recombination time is related with the electron density @xmath1 by the relation @xmath2 , which is much less than the typical light travel time across the blr .",
    "there is a simple but not necessary linear relationship between the observed continuum and the ionizing continuum ( which gives rise to the emission lines ) .",
    "_    from these points one can construct a simple 1d linear model given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the line and continuum light curves respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is the _ transfer function _ ( tf ) which holds the information about the geometry and kinematics of the blr gas . due to technical limitations ,",
    "the tf is collapsed to one single parameter : the time lag @xmath7 between both continuum and line light curve variations which is obtained through a cross - correlation analysis between them ( peterson 2001 ) .",
    "this lag @xmath7 is used to directly measure the blr size from @xmath8 ( peterson et al . , 2004 , kaspi et al . , 2005 ) . assuming a gravitationally bound system ( proven to be correct for those objects with measurements from several lines , where the observed anticorrelation between the distance @xmath9 to the bh and the line doppler widths is consistent with virialized motions of the blr gas ) and measuring the blr line widths @xmath10",
    ", it is possible to infer the mass of the central bh through @xmath11 where @xmath12 depends on the geometry of the blr and it is expected to be @xmath01 .",
    "many important results have been found from reverberation mapping studies , such as the stratification of the blr and black hole masses .",
    "also , an empirical relation between the blr size and the agn luminosity has been determined , which shows that _ the size of the broad - line region scales with luminosity_. this is not far from the @xmath13 relation expected if the blr in all agn have similar @xmath1 value and ionization conditions .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the scaling relation has the form @xmath14^{0.6\\pm0.1}\\mbox { pc}\\ ] ] ( as it is shown in figure 1b ) .",
    "preliminary results by bentz et al ( 2006 ) suggest a smaller slope of about 0.52 . using @xmath15 relation is thus possible to estimate the blr radius using @xmath16 alone , hence making bh mass estimation accessible for a large number of agn .",
    "such results can not be directly applied to high-@xmath17 , high-@xmath16 sources that contain the most massive bhs , since measuring their blr size requires an extrapolation by up to two orders of magnitude in luminosity in eq .",
    "( [ rl ] ) , which would be subject of a large uncertainty in the measured @xmath18 ( and then in the bh mass ) .",
    "this is the starting point of our quasars monitoring program .",
    "the few attempts to extend the luminosity range of agn with reverberation mapping results to high - luminosity agns have failed for two reasons : 1 .",
    "most high-@xmath16 sources are very slow variables with very low amplitude ( < 20% ) .",
    "2 . the line luminosity amplitude is even smaller than the continuum amplitude because the emission line response is averaged over the very large ( @xmath19 pc ) blr geometry . since 2005",
    "we are undertaking a novel strategy that uses optical broad band imaging to trigger spectroscopic follow up on a time scale of about one year .",
    "the idea is to identify high-@xmath16 sources with large enough continuum variations that will enable accurate and meaningful measurement of emission line variations .",
    "only a small fraction of high-@xmath16 sources show such variations at any given time , hence , a large number of sources must be constantly monitored to identify the onset of such events . given large enough continuum variations of a certain agn",
    ", the event must be followed spectroscopically .",
    "the expected blr size suggests that the spectroscopy phase should continue for at least four years .",
    "our sample consists of 56 quasars which are the brighest from the calan - tololo , 2df and sdss catalogues spread over all ras , with @xmath20 erg / sec , redshifts that range from 2.3 to 3.3 and mean r magnitude about @xmath018.2 . until today",
    ", black hole mass estimations using reverberation mapping analysis have been mainly based in the variability of the h@xmath21 ( @xmath224861 ) emission line which lies in the optical . in our optical monitoring program",
    "we are looking for the civ ( @xmath221549 ) emission line variability which , because of the the high redshifts of the ojects , falls into the optical window .",
    "reverberation mapping based in the h@xmath21 line can be made for these objects going to the ir .",
    "imaging is obtained with the 0.9 m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) every month for a sub - sample of quasars to monitor their continuum emission in the r band .",
    "monthly datasets allow us to have from 4 to 5 light curves points in average per object in a year , enough to detect the onset of a high variation in their fluxes .",
    "+ we use differential photometry respect 8 to 13 field stars which allows a photometry independent of the weather conditions , since the object and the field stars are observed simultaneously .",
    "these field stars are selected near to the quasar in order to appear in all the observations and have a magnitude cut - off of order of the quasar magnitude . to apply differential photometry we average the field star magnitudes in order to minimize the random variability of each of them , then @xmath23 is the average field star magnitude .",
    "the _ rms _ of each field star light curve is also checked periodically to look for intrinsically variable objects .",
    "this procedure gives us an average magnitude almost constant within the error bars ( @xmath24 variable with a typical value of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the quasar differential light curve ( dlc ) is given by @xmath26{\\pi_{i}f_{ij}}}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the difference in magnitude between the quasar and the average of field stars at time @xmath28 ( in flux it reads as the ratio of the object flux with the geometrical average of the field stars ) .",
    "so , as @xmath29 is almost flat , the time series of @xmath27 gives us the quasar light curve with respect to a constant standard and then variations of @xmath30 are exclusively atributted to the quasar . to quantify variability",
    "we define the paremeter @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the maximum and minimum flux in the dlc , then @xmath34 is a function of the difference @xmath35 ( because @xmath36 ) . in this way",
    ", the @xmath34 parameter is just the peak - to - peak variation in flux . +",
    "a minimum variability is needed in the continuum to detect a correlated variability in the emission lines ( which variation is weaker because is averaged in a larger geometry than the continuum source ) .",
    "previous reverberation campaigns have concluded that this minimum is @xmath015% , then , objects with variability larger than that trigger the spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "as mentioned before , we are triggering the spectroscopy follow up whenever we detect 15% variability using the 2.5 m dupont telescope at las campanas obseratory ( lco ) .",
    "we note that at such quasar luminosity , the typical intrinsic continuum variability time scale is 510 months .",
    "given the @xmath37 factor , in the observed frame the lines are expected to follow the continuum after 12 years . during 2005 - 2006",
    "we obtained spectroscopic observations for the whole sample to establish a zero baseline for future spectroscopy and evaluate the spectroscopic accuracy of our method . in 2007",
    "we have started the actual spectroscopic follow - up of the first quasars . currently , there are 5 targets which have been followed up since 2007 and there are 3 more quasars reciently ( 2008 ) selected for the spectroscopic monitoring .",
    "after 3 years of monitoring we can confirm that , in general , quasars are very slow and low amplitude variables ( < 0.1 mag ) .",
    "however , our strategy has allowed us to identify a subsample of 8 quasars that present a variability greater than 15% ( about 0.2 magnitudes , shown in figure 2 ) which correspond to the 14.2% of the sample .",
    "the variability in some of the objects has been seen to reach up to 20% and spectroscopic follow up has began for them . on the other hand ,",
    "the varibility of the field stars @xmath38 is lower than 3% .",
    "this range is represented in figure 2 using dot - dashed lines .",
    "all points of @xmath38 fall within this region .",
    "+ up to date dlc for our targets can be found at the website of the program ` http://www.cec.uchile.cl/\\simibotti/reverberation/ ` .",
    "we reviewed the basis of reverberation mapping technique which is a powerful tool to obtain black hole masses in agn and the size - luminosity ( @xmath39 ) relation from which we can estimate the size of the blr ( and then estimate the bh mass ) from a single epoch observation .",
    "currently this relation covers almost 5 magnitudes in luminosity , but it is subjected to large uncertainties when is extrapolated to high luminosity agn . for a better determination of the slope of this relation",
    "we need to span the luminosity range of agn with reverberation mapping results of @xmath40 erg / sec . to achieve that aim",
    "we present a monitoring campaing of a large sample of high-@xmath17 quasars which will extend these results by two orders of magnitude , measuring the broad - line region size and black hole mass of luminous agn at high redshifts .",
    "our strategy has been successful identifying a subsample of high variability ( @xmath4115% ) quasars which are being followed spectroscopically since 2007 .",
    "+ we expect that in the next 3 - 6 years reverberation mapping analysis will finally yield the highly anticipated measurement of bh masses in some of the most luminous quasars in our universe .",
