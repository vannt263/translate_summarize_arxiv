    "lanning has published six lists of uv - bright stars in the galactic plane , based on eye inspection of two - color photographic plates obtained by a.  sandage using the palomar schmidt telescope @xcite .",
    "magnitudes range from about 10 to about 20 , with @xmath2 colors typically bluer than @xmath3 .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite the lanning lists are a potentially rich source of rare or important objects , if the stars can be observed spectroscopically .",
    "those authors reported spectroscopy of nineteen objects drawn from list i , finding two emission line objects in the group .",
    "of these , one turned out to be a cataclysmic variable ( lanning 10 = v363 aur ) and the other is an emission - line shell star .",
    "other lanning stars have turned out to be previously known objects , such as hz  her ( her  x-1 ) , wz  sge ( a recurrent nova ) , white dwarfs , central stars of faint planetary nebulae ( e.g. , hfg  1 ) , and various stars named in the luminous stars of the northern ( or southern ) milky way survey ( ls / lss ) .    since",
    "lists ii  vi of the lanning catalog have been published relatively recently , such spectroscopy is not generally available in the literature for most of the 459 objects . as noted above , some lanning stars have proposed cross - identifications with previously known objects , based on positional and magnitude coincidence . however , besides the objects examined by @xcite , or followed up by others after that work called attention to them , only lanning 90 = v1776  cyg @xcite and lanning 159 @xcite have been newly described spectroscopically .",
    "thus we have undertaken a spectroscopic reconnaissance of a subset of lanning stars , the results of which are the subject of this paper .    in  2",
    "we describe the target selection , observations and data reduction . in ",
    "3 we present our classification of the spectra and a census of interesting objects , which we discuss in more detail in  4 .",
    "we close with a brief summary of our findings in  5 .",
    "we selected two samples of stars from lists i , ii and ( mostly ) v by @xcite and @xcite , which we refer to hereafter as the `` bright '' and `` faint '' samples .",
    "this selection was dictated in part by the timing of our observing runs .",
    "the stars lie along the northern milky way between right ascensions 19h and 22h and in the declination range @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "updated coordinates of all lanning stars along with any proposed cross - identifications can be found at http://www.stsci.edu/~lanning/index.html . in general , we have selected stars for spectroscopic follow - up which do not have existing cross - identifications . more than half of all the targets and all of the members of the bright sample are from the recently published and therefore poorly studied list v @xcite .",
    "the sample of stars that we observed is representative of the range of @xmath2 colors of stars included in these lists , and it should be representative of the types of stars to be found in the magnitude range examined .",
    "the bright sample includes 35 stars brighter than @xmath6 , while the faint sample includes 27 stars with @xmath7 .",
    "the members of the two samples are listed in tables  [ brighttargs ] and [ fainttargs ] .",
    "two of the stars of the faint sample were observed more than once , with different observations appearing as separate entries in table  [ fainttargs ] .",
    "the bright sample stars were observed with the kitt peak national observatory s ( kpno ) 2.1 m telescope and goldcam spectrograph on 2000 september 2425 with exposures of 300  s. the observation epochs are listed in table  [ brighttargs ] .",
    "we used a @xmath8 slit and a 500  mm@xmath9 grating to achieve a spectral resolution of 4.9    over the spectral range 38757530   .",
    "the observations were made either during small gaps in the primary observing schedule or during marginal weather .",
    "the observations of the faint sample were carried out in queue - scheduled mode with the _ hobby - eberly telescope _",
    "( _ het _ ) and marcario low - resolution spectrograph ( lrs ) in 2000 may and july with exposure times ranging between 120 and 1500  s. the specific observation epochs as well as the exposure times are listed in table  [ fainttargs ] .",
    "we employed a @xmath10 slit and a 600  mm@xmath9 grism , which yielded a spectral resolution of 4.5  and covered the range 42607245   .",
    "the spectral resolution and spectral coverage used in the observations obtained with the kpno 2.1 m telescope were determined by the objectives of the unrelated , primary observing program . in the case of the _ het _",
    "observations , we chose the highest resolution mode available with the lrs ; note that the spectral coverage is determined by the choice of grism .",
    "the resulting resolution and wavelength coverage are similar for the two instruments but differ from those normally used in classifying stars on the mk system .",
    "they are , however , well - suited for our purpose of carrying out a reconnaissance of lanning stars , where the goals are to assess the distribution of spectral types and to identify unusual objects for possible later study . the coverage of redder wavelengths ( h@xmath11 , molecular bands ) is especially useful for the latter goal .",
    "the spectra were reduced in a standard manner . in summary , following bias subtraction and flat field division , we traced and extracted spectra from a wide window along the slit , which included most of the stellar flux , subtracting the contribution from the night sky .",
    "an initial wavelength scale was derived from spectra of arc lamps taken either at the beginning of the night or interspersed among the target observations .",
    "the root - mean square residuals of a polynomial fit to the arc line wavelengths were less than 0.1 pixels .",
    "the zero point of the wavelength scale was refined with the help of strong night - sky emission lines that were recorded in the same exposure as the star , yielding a final absolute scale good to 0.30.5   .",
    "the flux scale was established with the help of observations of spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "uncertainties in the relative flux scale are less than 10% throughout most of the spectral range and increase to 1517% at wavelengths longer than 6500   . the absolute flux scale can be uncertain by as much as a factor of 2 , especially in the case of the _ het _ observations , since the spectra were taken through a narrow slit to assure best resolution under variable seeing and fluctuating image quality .",
    "discrete atmospheric absorption bands were corrected using templates derived from the spectra of the spectrophotometric standards stars , which are featureless in the regions of interest .",
    "in order to classify the program stars , we used the digital _ library of stellar spectra _ @xcite as a source of `` standard '' comparison spectra .",
    "this was possible since the resulting resolution of our spectroscopy is very similar to theirs , and the overlap in wavelength coverage is adequate .    for classification purposes it was desirable to remove the major effects of interstellar reddening from the observed spectra , especially since the jacoby et al .",
    "spectra were published with this correction applied . at the same time , it was desirable to retain some of the undulations in the spectrum that help to indicate spectral type .",
    "we thus _ approximately _ normalized both the program and standard spectra in the same way , using a broken straight line fit : we divided the blue portion of each spectrum by a straight line connecting the average flux density in a small `` blue '' wavelength interval to the average flux density in a small `` yellow '' interval , and we divided the red portion of each spectrum by a straight line fit connecting the same yellow interval with the average flux density in a small `` red '' wavelength interval .",
    "thus the spectra are pivoted about the center of the yellow interval , which is at 5500   .",
    "( the blue and red intervals are centered at 4040    and 7030   , respectively , for the spectra acquired at kpno ; and at 4410    and 7030   , respectively , for the spectra acquired at the _",
    "het_. for comparison with a given program star s spectrum , the jacoby et al .",
    "standard spectra were normalized with the appropriate choice of intervals . )",
    "this approximate normalization sufficed to remove the major effects of interstellar reddening ( which resembles a line broken at 5500   ) and the bulk of the curvature of the intrinsic spectrum of each star , leaving shorter - scale undulations along with the absorption line spectrum of each star .",
    "our normalization scheme is simple , rapid , and objective in execution , and entirely adequate for the purposes of our present study .    a rough classification",
    "was then carried out by visual inspection , comparing a subset of the spectra from jacoby et al .  with each program star .",
    "the subset of jacoby et al .",
    "stars included stars of spectral type o7 , o9 , b0 , b3 , b8 , a2 , a3 , a7 , f0 , f6 , g0 , k0 , k4 , m0 , and m5 , all of luminosity class v , along with two metal - weak stars of types f4 and f7 .",
    "normalized line depths and line depth ratios were the principle diagnostics of spectral type .",
    "additional information was drawn from the shape of the continuum after normalization .",
    "the main purpose of the classification was to divide the program stars into early and late spectral types and to note unusual spectra , including composite - spectrum and high - gravity stars .",
    "the entire observed wavelength range was used initially .",
    "for the bright sample , the classification was repeated using expanded plots of the 38005300region , and these classifications are preferred in table  [ brighttargs ] ; the two classifications were usually consistent , in one case a dubious classification being clarified using the expanded `` blue '' plots .",
    "further refinement in the spectral types , perhaps especially with respect to luminosity class of the earlier stars , may be possible with the present data , but such work would be better pursued with data that have somewhat higher resolution and additional coverage at shorter wavelengths .",
    "our estimated spectral types are given in tables  [ brighttargs ] and [ fainttargs ] , along with brief notes where warranted .",
    "in some cases a range of possible spectral types is given .",
    "in other cases , the best matching type from the set of standards is given ; in this case a tilde ( @xmath12 ) preceding the type indicates a somewhat broader range of allowed matches is possible but could not be explored with our sparse selection of standards . a colon ( :) indicates a difficult classification .    of the 35 stars in the bright sample , we classify seven stars as o to mid - b , nine stars as late - b to late - a , and nineteen stars as f or g. this group includes a large number of late f to early g stars .",
    "these are likely metal  poor or have large individual color errors , in order to have a sufficiently extreme @xmath2 color for inclusion in the catalog ( see further discussion below ) .",
    "there are no obvious candidates for high  gravity stars .",
    "some of the stars are strongly reddened , as shown by both the continuum shape before normalization and the presence of diffuse interstellar bands . for a sample of fourteen early - type stars",
    "an eye - estimate was made of the depth ( in continuum units ) of the unresolved @xmath136283 interstellar band .",
    "there is a positive but weak correlation between the band depths and @xmath2 color excesses , which were estimated using @xmath2 from @xcite and intrinsic colors inferred from the assigned spectral types .",
    "such a correlation is expected , since both interstellar absorption bands and reddening are due to `` dust . ''",
    "its weakness in the present sample is largely owing to observational scatter in the inferred and measured colors of the stars .",
    "the fainter sample of 27 lanning stars contains 16 stars classified by us as o or b , three stars called `` hot , high gravity , '' five da , da + late - type , or other composite stars , one f ",
    "g star , one he - strong star , and a star surrounded by an emission nebula .",
    "in addition , we observed the m dwarf g20930 , which is a high proper motion star in the field of lanning 93 .",
    "this sample shows the reverse properties of the bright sample , namely it includes more high - gravity stars and only one late f  g star .",
    "we interpret this as a result of color `` deselection '' of marginal stars by interstellar reddening .",
    "g stars are expected to have @xmath2 colors redder than the nominal cutoff adopted by lanning for generating the catalog from the sandage plates .",
    "they can , however , enter the lanning sample if they are metal weak ( i.e. , subdwarfs , with reduced line blocking in the ultraviolet ) or if the individual photometric errors are large ; in either case , their @xmath2 colors will still be close to the cutoff .",
    "fainter stars on average will be more distant , hence more heavily reddened , so that f  g stars among them no longer appear in a color - selected catalog , even if they are subdwarfs or in the case of large photometric errors .",
    "likewise , many ( but not all ) luminous ob stars may be very heavily reddened if they are apparently faint in these milky way fields .",
    "thus fainter lanning stars in the sample tend to be of lower intrinsic luminosity , since that is what remains of the unreddened nearby sample ; or to have very negative intrinsic @xmath2 color , to withstand significant reddening .",
    "several unusual spectra , including composite hot+cool systems , emission line stars , and he - strong stars were found . in particular , lanning 121 , lanning 386 and lanning 441 are composite , with  b ,  d , tio and other absorption features indicative of a late - type star apparent in the spectra , along with h or lines from a hotter star . lanning 388 is `` he - strong , '' that is , moderately strong and lines are present along with strong h balmer lines ; @xmath134922 , for example , is nearly as deep as h@xmath14 , unlike in the stars from the jacoby et al",
    ".  atlas to which it was compared ( hd  35619 o7  v , hd  12323 o9  v , hd  158659 b0  v ) .",
    "several of the 62 lanning stars sampled are thus `` interesting '' , not counting da white dwarfs and other possible high - gravity stars . in the following section we discuss the properties of some of these objects further .",
    "for the emission - line stars discussed below , we attempted to use the strength of the @xmath15 diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) to estimate the reddening and hence the extinction and distance .",
    "we prefer this method instead of comparing observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and intrinsic seds inferred from the spectral types , because uncertainties in the inferred spectral type are large enough that the intrinsic seds of the stars can not be accurately determined .",
    "moreover , the spectra of these stars include emission lines and therefore possibly a non - stellar continuum , which could distort the observed seds .",
    "we used the calibrations of the @xmath16 dib as a reddening indicator reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and we have assumed a relationship between visual extinction and distance of @xmath17 @xcite . using the resulting distances and extinction - corrected fluxes , we are able to report approximate emission - line luminosities",
    ". uncertainties in reddening , assessed from the dispersion of results obtained from different methods , are of order 0.2  mag .",
    "uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration due to slit losses lead to error bars of a factor of 2 in quoted luminosity .",
    "there is also an uncertainty in converting visual extinction to distance , which is more difficult to assess in patchy milky way fields , that we have not taken into account .    _ lanning 19 and lanning 21",

    "the spectrum of the star itself is rather blue with no obvious absorption lines ; some filling in by emission may have occurred .",
    "the nebula is visible in the red , second - generation palomar observatory sky survey plate of this region .",
    "it is elliptical in shape with a major axis of length @xmath18 , oriented approximately e  w .",
    "the inner part of the nebula is particularly bright and appears to define an inner ellipse whose major axis is approximately at right angles to that of the outer nebula . by chance ,",
    "the spectrograph slit was set at a position angle of @xmath19 , which is along the major axis of the outer nebula .",
    "the sky - subtracted 2-dimensional spectrum shows the low - ionization emission lines ( [ ]  @xmath206717,6731 , [ ]  @xmath206548,6583 , balmer lines ) extending along the entire length of the slit of @xmath18 .",
    "there are knots of enhanced emission in the strongest low - ionization lines at a distance of about @xmath21 from the central star , which also appears to be the extent of the -emitting region of the nebula .",
    "the spectrum of the innermost parts of the nebula , extracted from a window of width @xmath22 , is shown in figure  [ figemstars ] , and the relative emission - line strengths measured from it are reported in table  [ emlines ] , with no extinction corrections applied . since the slit was oriented at the parallactic angle during this observation , the relative line strengths should not be distorted by differential atmospheric refraction at the slit . from the relative strengths of the emission lines we can infer some of the basic properties of the inner nebula .",

    "the spectrum resembles those of t  tauri stars in the collection of @xcite , suggesting that this object may be a t  tauri star as well .",
    "if so , the reddening and distance quoted combined with an apparent visual magnitude of @xmath39 would imply a very luminous , hence young object .",
    "we have obtained spectra and made preliminary classifications of 62 uv  bright stars . of these 62 objects ,",
    "four are emission - line stars , three are composite systems ( double - counting one emission - line star ) , and another shows strong absorption lines . from the perspective of spectral classification , we find 39% more or less normal o  mid  b stars , 15% late  b  late a stars and 32% f ",

    "thus we reaffirm and greatly extend the conclusion to be inferred from @xcite that at least one out of every ten lanning stars is `` interesting '' and worthy of individual study .    lanning stars brighter than @xmath40",
    "are often found to be late f or early g stars , at least in the fields described in paper v @xcite .",

    "<S> our targets were grouped into two samples , a bright ( @xmath0 ) sample of 35 stars observed with the kitt peak 2.1 m telescope and a faint ( @xmath1 ) sample of 27 stars observed with the _ hobby - eberly telescope_. we find 39% fairly normal o  mid  b stars , 15% late  b  late a stars and 32% f  </S>",
    "<S> g stars , with 13% of the stars being high gravity objects , composite , or otherwise peculiar . included are four emission - line stars , three composite systems . </S>",
    "<S> thus one out of every ten lanning stars is `` interesting '' and may deserve individual study . </S>",
    "<S> stars in the bright sample are often found to be late f or early g stars , although this sample does include interesting stars as well . </S>",
    "<S> no such large contamination occurs among the fainter stars , however , owing to `` deselection '' of these stars by interstellar reddening in the low - latitude fields of the survey . </S>"
