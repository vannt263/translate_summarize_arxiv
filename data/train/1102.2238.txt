    "the phenomenon of particle creation from quantum vacuum by moving boundaries or due to time - dependent properties of materials , commonly referred to as the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) @xcite , has been investigated since the pioneering works of moore @xcite and dewitt @xcite ( see also the subsequent works carried in refs .",
    "@xcite ) in a wide variety of situations and with the aid of quite different approaches ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for excellent reviews on the subject ) .",
    "particularly , perturbative and numerical approaches were applied for single mirrors @xcite and cavities @xcite .",
    "initial field states different from vacuum were also considered for single mirrors @xcite and cavities as well @xcite .",
    "the first experimental observation of this phenomenon was recently announced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "taking into account the difficulties in generating appreciable mechanical oscillation frequencies ( of the order of ghz ) to obtain a detectable number of photons , recent experimental schemes focus on simulating moving boundaries by considering material bodies with time - dependent electromagnetic properties .",
    "these possibilities were first proposed by yablonovitch @xcite and have been further developed in theoretical works which considered materials with time - dependent permittivities and time - dependent surface conductivities @xcite ( see the nice compilation done in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the dce for a massless scalar field within a cavity containing a thin semiconducting film with time - dependent conductivity and centered at the middle of the cavity was studied .",
    "the coupling of such a film to the quantum scalar field was modeled by a delta - potential with time - dependent strength . a generalization to the case of an electromagnetic field",
    "was carried out in @xcite .",
    "very promising and ingenious experimental set - ups to simulate non - stationary boundaries include the changing of the reflectivity of a semiconductor by the incidence of a periodic sequence of short laser pulses @xcite or by using a coplanar waveguide terminated by a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) . applying a variable magnetic flux on the squid , a single moving mirror can be simulated @xcite . a first step toward the experimental verification of the dce was recently made in @xcite using this approach .",
    "moreover , the same group recently claimed to have observed the dce @xcite .",
    "key ingredients in the predictions of the dce are the boundary conditions ( bc ) under consideration and naturally the quantum field submitted to those bc .",
    "quite general bc are the so called robin ones which , for the case of a scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions and a single mirror fixed at @xmath0 , are defined by @xmath1_{x = a}$ ] , where @xmath2 is a real parameter ( called hereafter as robin parameter ) . for the case of a moving boundary , the previous relation is imposed in the comoving frame and the corresponding bc in the laboratory frame is obtained after an appropriate lorentz transformation .",
    "this bc have the nice feature of interpolating continuously dirichlet ( @xmath3 ) and neumann ( @xmath4 ) ones and occurs in several areas of physics and mathematics .",
    "for instance , in classical mechanics they will appear if one considers a vibrating string coupled to a spring which satisfies hooke s law and is localized at one of its edges @xcite . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics ,",
    "robin bc occur as the most general bc imposed by a wall ensuring the hermiticity of the hamiltonian as well as a null probability flux through it @xcite .",
    "regarding the static casimir effect @xcite , it was shown that the casimir force between two parallel plates which impose robin bc on a real scalar field may have its sign changed if appropriate choices are made for the corresponding robin parameters of each mirror @xcite .",
    "such kind of repulsive casimir force was also predicted , in the case of parallel plates , by boyer in the 70s , who considered a pair of perfectly conducting and infinitely permeable plates @xcite .",
    "further investigations on the influence of robin bc in the static casimir effect , including thermal corrections and the case of casimir piston setups , were carried , for instance , in refs .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for the influence of this bc on the structure of quantum vacuum .",
    "only recently robin bc were considered in the context of the dce . for a massless scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions submitted to a robin bc at a single moving mirror",
    "the radiation reaction force on the moving mirror and the particle creation rate were computed in refs .",
    "@xcite . interestingly , for robin bc , the radiation reaction force acquires a dispersive component , in sharp contrast with dirichlet and neumann cases where the force is purely dissipative .",
    "it was also shown that , for a given robin parameter , there exists a mechanical frequency of motion that dramatically reduces the particle creation effect @xcite .",
    "finally , and of crucial importance for the present work , robin bc can also be useful to describe phenomenological models for penetrable surfaces and under certain conditions they simulate the plasma model for real metals @xcite . in these situations , for frequencies @xmath5 much smaller than the plasma frequency @xmath6 , the robin parameter @xmath2 can be identified as the plasma wavelength @xmath7 . in other words , the robin parameter @xmath2 gives us an estimative of the penetration length of the mirror under consideration .",
    "since to simulate a motion of a reflecting mirror is equivalent to simulate a real metal with time - dependent plasma wavelength , the above interpretation of @xmath2 leads naturally to the consideration of time - dependent robin parameters . specifically speaking , it is quite natural to simulate the motion of a reflecting mirror by considering the quantum field submitted to a robin bc at a static mirror but with a time - dependent robin parameter @xmath8",
    ". the kind of boundary motion which is being simulated is determined by the kind of time - dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is precisely to analyze this situation for a massless scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "particularly , we shall compute explicitly the particle creation rate for a natural choice of time - dependence for @xmath8 which is directly related to recent experimental proposals .",
    "this paper in organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ bogoliubov ] the bogoliubov transformation between the in and out creation / annihilation operators are obtained , allowing us to find the spectral distribution of the created particles and the particle creation rate in sec . [ spectrum ] and [ creation_rate ] , respectively . finally , in sec . [ conc ]",
    "we present our conclusions and final remarks . throughout this work we consider @xmath9 .",
    "we start considering a real massless scalar field @xmath10 in 1 + 1 dimensions which satisfies the klein - gordon equation , @xmath11 , and is submitted to a time - dependent robin bc at a mirror fixed at the origin , namely , @xmath12 . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath8 departs only slightly from a positive constant @xmath13 , so that we can write @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a smooth time - dependent function satisfying the condition @xmath16 , for every @xmath17 . under these assumptions in the limit @xmath18 we recover neumann bc . on the other hand , to reobtain dirichlet bc ( @xmath19 ) , because of condition @xmath20 , we must also take @xmath21 .",
    "if we consider only @xmath22 we re - obtain the usual time - independent robin bc .",
    "moreover , we shall also impose that @xmath21 for @xmath23 .",
    "the bc satisfied by @xmath15 then reads @xmath24_{x=0 } -\\;\\phi(0,t ) + \\delta\\gamma(t)\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\phi(x , t)}{\\partial x}\\right]_{x=0}=0\\ , .",

    "following ford and vilenkin @xcite we write @xmath25 where , by assumption , @xmath26 satisfies the klein - gordon equation , @xmath27 , and the time - independent robin bc , @xmath28_{x=0 } -\\;\\phi_0(0,t ) = 0\\ , .",

    "( [ bc - phizero ] ) was used .",
    "hereafter it will be convenient to work in the fourier domain , such that    @xmath33    it is worth emphasizing at this moment that , by assumption , @xmath34 is a prescribed function of @xmath17 , so that @xmath35 is known , in principle . since @xmath36 is the solution with time - independent robin bc , this field",

    "consequently , we can state that particles were created from an initial vacuum state due only to the time - dependence of @xmath15 in the bc ( [ bc-1 ] ) imposed on the field by the static mirror .",
    "in fact , for @xmath22 for all times , which corresponds to a static mirror imposing the standard time - independent robin bc on the field , we have @xmath65 and no particles will be created , as expected .",
    "the particle creation effect will be further investigated in the next sections , where we will choose a specific time - dependent expression for @xmath8 in order to compute explicitly the corresponding spectral distribution of the created particles as well as the respective particle creation rate .",
    "we start by writing the spectral distribution of the created particles as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of created particles with frequency between @xmath5 and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) per unit frequency . from the previous definition for @xmath67",

    "this is a signature of the fact that particles are created in pairs : for each particle created with frequency @xmath5 there is a twin particle created with frequency @xmath94 . in second place , note that for @xmath95 , where a robin bc with a time - independent parameter @xmath13 is re - obtained , the spectrum of created particles vanishes , as expected ( recall that the mirror which imposes the bc on the field is at rest ) .",
    "further , for a fixed ( finite ) value of @xmath96 , the limit @xmath18 ( neumann bc imposed on the field at a static mirror ) also leads to a vanishing spectrum of created particles .",

    "]    it is worth noting that the particle creation rate shown in fig .",
    "[ creationrate2 ] starts growing with @xmath96 until it achieves a maximum value for a given value of @xmath96 and then it approaches monotonically to zero as @xmath96 goes to infinity .",
    "this behaviour should be compared with that obtained for a moving mirror which imposes on the field a robin bc with a time - independent parameter , where the particle creation rate after passing through one maximum and one minimum grows indefinitely as @xmath96 goes to infinity ( see ref .",
    "naively , we could expect similar behaviors for these two problems , after all , a time - dependent robin parameter should simulate , in principle , a moving mirror so that a high frequency oscillating @xmath8 should mean a high frequency oscillating mirror .",
    "however , the interpretation of the robin parameter @xmath2 as an estimative of the penetration depth of the material boundary is rigorously proved only for static mirrors . even in this case , this identification is valid only for the field modes whose frequencies are much smaller than the plasma frequency ( but this condition is easily achieved since the plasma frequency is much higher than the mechanical frequencies we want to simulate ) .",
    "it is plausible that such an interpretation remains valid for _ slowly _ time - varying @xmath119 , but not for high frequency oscillating @xmath8 .",

    "exploring the peculiar properties of robin bc , particularly , the interpretation of the robin parameter , we presented a simple and yet instructive theoretical model where a single static mirror with time - dependent properties described by a time - dependent robin parameter simulates a moving boundary .",
    "we used this model to study analytically the dynamical casimir effect of a system that may of some value for further understanding of a ongoing experiment based on a one - dimensional transmission line terminated by a squid . in this setup a time - dependent magnetic flux through the squid gives rise to particle creation phenomenon .",
    "employing a perturbative approach , we showed that particles can be created due to the time - dependence of the robin parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we obtained explicitly the spectrum of the created particles as well as the total particle creation rate for a particular choice of @xmath8 which has a practical interest concerning the experiment just described .",
    "our model can also be used as a theoretical model to investigate other experimental setups suggested for measuring the dynamical casimir effect , as for example , the promising experimental proposal of the padua group @xcite .",
    "all we have to do is to choose appropriately the time - dependence of @xmath8 to simulate correctly the physical situation under consideration .",
    "we emphasize that the particle creation phenomena due to a time - dependent robin bc imposed on the field at a static mirror has similarities and differences with the case where a time - independent robin bc is imposed on the field at a moving mirror , as discussed by mintz _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the main difference being the respective behaviors of the total particle creation rate for high values of @xmath96 ( in the former case , where @xmath96 means the mechanical frequency of the moving mirror , this rate grows indefinitely as @xmath122 , while in the latter case , where @xmath96 gives a measure of how quick the time - dependent robin parameter @xmath8 varies , this rate goes to zero , as @xmath122 ) . in the appropriate limits of the usual time - independent dirichlet ( @xmath19 ) ,",
