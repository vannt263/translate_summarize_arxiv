    "in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm for galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxies are embedded in extended dark matter distributions with a specific and ( nearly ) universal radial profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of rotation curves from neutral hydrogen ( ) observations in the outer parts of late - type galaxies have provided evidence for the presence of dark matter in these systems already more than two decades ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the outer parts of early - type galaxies ,",
    "however , cold gas is scarce ( but see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so evidence for a dark matter halo has to come from other tracers , such as kinematics of stars , planetary nebulae and globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or hot x - ray gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , these tracers are not always ( sufficiently ) available , the observations are often challenging , and the interpretation modeling dependent . also in the inner parts of galaxies the amount , shape and profile of dark matter is still poorly known ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , even though stellar kinematics are readily available .",
    "a fundamental problem in using stellar kinematics ( as well as other collisionless kinematic tracers ) for this purpose is the mass - anisotropy degeneracy : a change in the measured line - of - sight velocity dispersion can be due to a change in total mass , but also due to a change in velocity anisotropy .",
    "both effects can be disentangled by measuring also the higher - order velocity moments @xcite , but only the inner parts of nearby galaxies are bright enough to obtain the required high - quality kinematic measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . a unique alternative to break the mass - anisotropy degeneracy is provided by gravitational lensing . in case of strong lensing",
    ", the mass of a foreground galaxy bends the light of a distant bright object behind it , resulting in multiple images . from the separation and fluxes of the images",
    "the total mass distribution of the lens galaxy can be inferred directly .",
    "the velocity anisotropy then can be determined from the observed velocity dispersion , without the need for higher - order velocity moments .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite , and references therein ) have applied this approach to several strong lensing systems , of which 0047 - 281 @xcite is the best constrained case , with three radially separated velocity dispersion measurements extending to about the effective radius of the lens galaxy .",
    "they measure the mass within the einstein radius by fitting a singular isothermal ellipsoid to the positions of the quasar images .",
    "this einstein mass is used to set the amplitude of the total ( stellar and dark ) matter distribution , which they assume to be spherical .",
    "the constant stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath16 determines the contribution of the stars with a fixed radial profile , with the remainder due to dark matter with a single power - law profile with slope @xmath21 .",
    "they then compare the dispersion profile predicted by the spherical jeans equations , for an ad - hoc assumption of the velocity anisotropy @xmath22 , with the observed dispersion measurements .",
    "based on a reasonably constrained @xmath16 and an upper limit on @xmath21 , they conclude that a significant amount of dark matter is present in the inner parts of the lens galaxy , with a slope shallower than the nearly isothermal total mass distribution . an additional ( external ) constraint on @xmath16 ( or @xmath21 ) is needed to go beyond this limit on the dark matter distribution .",
    "even so , their results are limited by too few kinematic constraints ( which leaves the anisotropy degenerate ) , and by the use of a simple spherical dynamical model .",
    "clearly , most lens galaxies are significantly flattened and so can not be well - described by spherical models .",
    "non - spherical models provide a more realistic description of the lens galaxy , but the increase in freedom requires also ( significantly ) more spatially resolved kinematic measurements to constrain them .",
    "only a few of the known strong gravitational lens systems are close enough to obtain such kinematic data .",
    "even then , one can make ( ad - hoc ) assumptions on the velocity distribution , such as velocity isotropy in the meridional plane of an axisymmetric model .",
    "the latter restriction to a distribution function of two ( instead of three ) integrals of motion allows for the recovery of the intrinsic shape and mass distribution in the presence of two - dimensional kinematic data @xcite , possibly even without the additional constraint provided by gravitational lensing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we relax the two - integral assumption and find that one can still derive independent determinations of the intrinsic mass distribution from both gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics with two - dimensional kinematic data .",
    "we have observed the gravitational lens system qso2237 + 0305 , well - known as the einstein cross , with the integral - field spectrograph ` gmos `  on the gemini - north telescope .",
    "we fit the extracted stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps of the inner parts of the lens galaxy at a redshift @xmath3 with axisymmetric dynamical models .",
    "the resulting intrinsic mass distribution agrees well with that inferred from the lens model that fits the four quasar image positions and relative fluxes .",
    "furthermore , we compare this total mass distribution with the stellar mass distribution , based on an independent estimate of the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath16 , to place constraints on the dark matter distribution in the inner parts of the lens galaxy .    in section  [ sec : observations ] , we briefly describe the einstein cross , and we present the photometric and spectroscopic observations . in section  [ sec",

    "the resulting precise measurements of the positions and relative fluxes of the quasar images can be used to construct a detailed lens model .",
    "in contrast , kinematic data of the lens galaxy is very scarce , with only one measured central stellar velocity dispersion @xcite and two  rotation curve measurements in the very outer parts @xcite .",
    "there are several previous integral - field studies of the einstein cross : ` tiger ` : ; ` integral ` : @xcite ; ` cirpass ` : @xcite .",
    "however , none of these studies were concerned with the stellar kinematics of the lens galaxy , but instead investigated the quasar spectra .",

    "although also optical flux ratios are given on this website , we use the radio fluxes provided by @xcite , because they are in general ( much ) less affected by differential extinction or microlensing .",
    "observations of the einstein cross lens system were carried out using the integral - field unit of the ` gmos`-north spectrograph @xcite on july 17@xmath33 and august 1@xmath34 2005 as part of the program gn-2005a - dd-7 .",
    "the data were obtained using the ifu two - slit mode that provides a field - of - view of 5@xmath357 .",

    "eight individual science exposures of 1895 seconds each were obtained during the two nights , resulting in a total on - source integration time of @xmath36 hours .",
    "an offset of 03 was introduced between exposures to avoid bad ccd regions or lost fibers .",
    "the r400-g5305 grating in combination with the cat - g0309 filter was used to cover a wavelength range of 78009200  with a fwhm spectral resolution of 2.8 .    for the data reduction we used an updated version of the officially distributed gemini iraf package .",
    "we applied bias subtraction , flat - fielding and cosmic ray rejection ( using the _ l.a .  cosmic _ algorithm by * ? ? ? * ) to each science exposure , and wavelength calibration after the extraction of the data . a careful flat - fielding procedure , crucial for proper removal of fringes in the spectral direction ,",
    "was carried out using the quartz halogen ( qh ) lamp .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with cuar lamp exposures taken before each science exposure . at the observed wavelengths , a complex spectrum of h@xmath37o absorption features overlaps with the cat lines we are interested in .",
    "we constructed a correction spectrum from observations of the white dwarf star wolf1346 , taken with the same instrumental setup as our science frames .",
    "we checked the range of fiber - to - fiber variations of the spectral resolution of the instrument by measuring the width of the sky lines in each fiber , resulting in the nominal fwhm value of @xmath38  for most of the data cubes . in order to combine all the data , we homogenized the science frames by convolving all spectra to an instrumental fwhm resolution of 3.1  ( or @xmath39kms@xmath6 ) and resampling the spectra to the same range and sampling in wavelength .",
    "after interpolating each science frame to a common spatial grid , taking into account the small spatial offsets applied during the observations , we sum the spectra sharing the same position in the sky to produce the final merged data cube .",
    "the significant contribution from the sky lines to the overall spectrum of the lens galaxy made the sky subtraction the most challenging step in the data reduction process .",
    "although the scatter in the instrumental resolution was small within the individual science frames , the combined effect of other steps in the data reduction ( e.g. fringing , telluric absorption , resampling of data in wavelength ) , introduced alterations in the shape of the sky lines ( from the sky fibers ) that were not equally reproduced in the science fibers . as a consequence",
    "any attempt to use the sky from the sky fibers resulted in serious systematic effects ( i.e.  p - cygni like residuals ) in the galaxy spectra underneath . in order to minimize these effects",
    ", we chose to extract the sky spectra from the outer most regions of our fully merged science data cube , where no galaxy light was appreciable .",
    "the sky was then subtracted optimally as described below .",
    "to measure reliable stellar kinematics we first co - add spectra using the adaptive spatial two dimensional binning scheme of @xcite to obtain in each resulting ( voronoi ) bin a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the resulting spectra are spectrally rebinned to steps of constant @xmath40 , equivalent to a sampling of 24kms@xmath6  per pixel .",
    "we adopt the single stellar population ( ssp ) models of @xcite as spectral templates , which are convolved to have the same effective instrumental broadening as the ` gmos `  data .",
    "next , using an updated version ( v4.2 ) of the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) algorithm of @xcite , a non - negative linear combination of these templates is convolved with a gaussian line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) and fit to each observed spectrum , to derive the mean line - of - sight velocity @xmath31 and velocity dispersion @xmath41 per bin on the plane of the sky .",
    "this version of the code allows for the inclusion of a sky spectrum into the set of stellar templates , and determines the optimal scaling of the sky to the overall spectrum .",
    "we used this procedure to _ clean _ the individual spectra in our merged data cube , before we derived the final stellar kinematics .",
    "as an example of how this routine performed , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] the spectrum from the center of the lens galaxy , with the best - fit ssp template overplotted .",
    "we also plot the removed sky spectrum on top , to show that the sky emission - lines can severely affect the ca  ii triplet absorption lines that we use to extract the stellar kinematics , especially at larger radii where the the relative contribution from the sky is more significant .",
    "in particular , in our experiments , a poor sky subtraction caused significant systematic effects in the map of @xmath41 at the receding side of the galaxy , where one of the absorption lines is redshifted onto ( the residual of ) a sky emission line .",
    "the map of @xmath31 , however , was ( nearly ) unaffected , showing regular rotation with a straight zero - velocity curve that coincides with the minor axis of the ( bulge ) photometry .",
    "these tests already show that , at least in the inner parts of the lens galaxy , both the photometry and kinematics are consistent with axisymmetry .",
    "if we now _ assume _ this symmetry from the start and apply it during the extracting of the stellar kinematics , we can not only increase the s / n , but at the same time also suppress or even remove systematic effects .",
    "to do this , we make use of a built - in functionality in the ppxf algorithm that allows diametrically opposed spectra to be fitted simultaneously . the symmetry imposed by this technique can be either mirror - symmetric or point - symmetric , corresponding to the behavior of the losvd in axisymmetric or triaxial stellar systems , respectively . in practice , this is done following the method outlined by @xcite , whereby the two spectra from opposed positions in the galaxy are laid end - to - end to create a single vector .",
    "the template library is also doubled in length , where the second half is convolved by the symmetric counterpart of the broadening function used for the first half ( simply reflecting the broadening kernel around the systemic velocity ) .",
    "the two galaxy spectra are therefore fitted simultaneously , with the implied assumption of symmetry .    performing a symmetric extraction of the kinematics",
    "presents a number of advantages , and has been used by numerous authors not just as a quality - check ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also when the assumption of symmetry is an integral part of the analysis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the two main advantages for the case presented here are in reducing the impact of systematic effects in the data ( including sky subtraction ) and increasing the effective spatial resolution .",
    "the latter is possible since under the assumption of axisymmetry , all moments of the losvd are symmetric about the galaxy major axis .",
    "we can therefore ` fold ' the data cube about the major axis , combining spectra from the two hemispheres , which increases the effective s / n within a given spatial element , and therefore reduces the required spatial bin size .",
    "we interpolate the merged ` gmos `  data cube onto a new spatial grid with @xmath42 and @xmath43 coordinates parallel to the major and minor photometric axes respectively .",
    "we then fold the data - cube about the major axis by summing together spatial pixels ( ` spaxels ' ) with equal @xmath44 positions . before spatially binning the spectra to a minimum s / n , the folded data cube is folded again , into a single quadrant by combining spaxels with equal @xmath45 positions .",
    "the voronoi bins are derived in this quadrant , and the resulting bin centers are mirrored around @xmath46 .",
    "the spectra are combined according to these voronoi bins to ensure symmetry around the minor axis . at the field perimeter",
    ", it is generally not the case that both sides of the galaxy are sampled at the exact same positions , due to the alignment of the ` gmos `  field with respect to the galaxy s principle axes .",
    "this results in some bins where the s / n of the opposed spectra is far from equal , or in some cases where observations are only present on one side of the galaxy .",
    "the former is taken into account by consideration of the error spectrum of each bin .",
    "for the latter , the bin is fitted as a single spectrum , giving kinematic values only at that position , without a mirrored counterpart .        from monte - carlo simulations for data of this spectral range and resolution , a minimum s / n of 20",
    "is deemed optimal .",
    "this results in an average error in both @xmath31 and @xmath41 of about @xmath47kms@xmath6 , while still preserving the spatial resolution of the data .",
    "however , towards the edge of the ` gmos `  field , the errors increase to @xmath48kms@xmath6  in @xmath31 and @xmath49kms@xmath6  in @xmath41 .",
    "the final symmetrically binned data cube consists of @xmath50 bins , with the largest containing @xmath51 individual 0.2  spaxels .",
    "the resulting ( original and symmetrized ) maps of @xmath31 and @xmath41 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eckin ] , with superposed contours of the integrated flux from the data cube .",
    "the velocity map shows regular rotation with amplitude of @xmath31 up to @xmath5kms@xmath6 .",
    "the dispersion map shows somewhat higher values of @xmath41 at the position of the quasar images .",
    "this is caused by imperfect subtraction of the quasar continuum , which acts to strongly dilute the absorption lines and make them appear broader .    in our stellar template fit to the observed spectra , we include additive polynomials to account for remaining systematic effects in the data , e.g. due to imperfect flat fielding . at the same time , we use these additive components to mimic the contaminating contribution of the quasar images , which impart a strong featureless continuum on top of the galaxy s integrated stellar spectrum .",
    "this method nicely removes nearly all contribution from the quasar , except where the quasar images are the brightest , in which case @xmath41 can not be reliable measured .",
    "we exclude these regions when we fit dynamical models .",
    "however , between the quasar images , the spectra are dominated by the stellar light of the galaxy , giving a reliable central dispersion @xmath52kms@xmath6 .",
    "likewise , at the edges of the field , the quasar contamination is small , providing a reliable gradient in the velocity dispersion .    comparing in fig .",
    "[ fig : eckin ] the symmetrized stellar kinematics with what is obtained without imposing axisymmetry , there is a marked reduction of noise and systematic effects , especially in the velocity dispersion map .",
    "however , the main features of regular rotation , decreasing @xmath41 at larger radii , as well as corresponding velocity and dispersion amplitudes , are present in both approaches , albeit with larger uncertainty and systematics in the non - symmetrized case . given the various advantages , we consider hereafter the symmetrically extracted kinematics .      as mentioned above , both the photometry and ( unsymmetrized ) kinematics in the inner parts of the lens galaxy are consistent with axisymmetry .",
    "hence , in constructing dynamical models we consider an axisymmetric stellar system in which both the potential @xmath53 and distribution function ( df ) are independent of azimuth @xmath54 and time .",
    "by jeans ( @xcite ) theorem the df only depends on the isolating integrals of motion : @xmath55 , with energy @xmath56 , angular momentum @xmath57 parallel to the symmetry @xmath58-axis , and a third integral @xmath59 for which in general no explicit expression is known . however , usually may loose this symmetry . ]",
    "@xmath59 is invariant under the change @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that the mean velocity is in the azimuthal direction ( @xmath61 ) and the velocity ellipsoid is aligned with the rotation direction ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "@xcite introduced a method that sidesteps our ignorance about the non - classical integrals of motion .",
    "it finds the set of weights of orbits computed in an arbitrary gravitational potential that best reproduces all available photometric and kinematic data at the same time .",
    "the method has proved to be powerful in building detailed spherical and axisymmetric models of nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as globular clusters , and since recently also triaxial models @xcite .",
    "however , in all cases the stellar systems are significant closer than the lens galaxy in the einstein cross , allowing for ( even ) more and higher - order stellar kinematic measurements necessary to constrain the large freedom in this general modeling method .",
    "instead we construct simpler , but still realistic dynamical models based on the solution of the axisymmetric jeans equations .",
    "when we multiply the collisionless boltzmann equation in cylindrical coordinates by respectively @xmath63 and @xmath64 and integrate over all velocities , we obtain the two jeans equations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  4 - 29 ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the intrinsic luminosity density . due to the assumed axisymmetry ,",
    "all terms in the third jeans equation , that follows from multiplying by @xmath67 , vanish .",
    "we are thus left with four unknown second order velocity moments @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 and only two equations .",
    "this means we have to make assumptions about the velocity anisotropy , or in other words the shape and alignment of the velocity ellipsoid . in case",
    "the velocity ellipsoid is aligned with the cylindrical @xmath72 coordinate system @xmath73 , so that we can readily solve equation   for @xmath69 . if we next assume a constant flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane , we can write @xmath74 and solve equation   for @xmath70 .",
    "this assumption provides in general a good description for the kinematics of real disk galaxies @xcite , such as the lens galaxy in the einstein cross , which is an early - type spiral galaxy .",
