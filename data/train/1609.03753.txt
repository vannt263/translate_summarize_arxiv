    "active galactic nucleus ( agn ) evolution is one of the vital issues to investigate the central black hole ( bh ) accretion , galaxy formation , and large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "some statistical results , such as luminosity functions ( lfs ) and number counts , can be obtained from multi - wavelength sky surveys .",
    "the optical lfs of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) were obtained from the 2df survey @xcite . using the data from rosat , _ chandra _ , and xmm-_newton _ satellites , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite constructed the soft x - ray agn lfs in the @xmath13 kev band .",
    "the hard x - ray lfs and hard x - ray cosmic background in the @xmath14 kev band were studied as well @xcite . from these early studies ,",
    "we know that neither density evolution nor luminosity evolution can fully describe agn lf evolutionary properties .",
    "however , a downsizing feature has been reported , which is the number density of galaxies / agns peaking at low redshift @xcite .",
    "thus , the crucial explorations of the agn lfs in the optical band for the high - redshift universe , which have been performed during recent years , have become more important .",
    "the qso lfs at @xmath15 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have been given @xcite .",
    "the agn lfs at @xmath16 have been extended to the faint end of @xmath17 by the great observatories origins deeps survey ( goods ) high - redshift agn sample @xcite .",
    "the faint type-1 agn lfs have been given by @xcite from the vimos - vlt deep survey .",
    "with the 2df - sdss data , the agn lf at @xmath18 has been extended 2.5 mag fainter @xcite than the previous one . at @xmath2 ,",
    "some faint end data points for qso lf have been provided by the noao deep wide - field survey and the deep lens survey @xcite .",
    "the agn lfs at @xmath3 were obtained by the sdss deep survey @xcite and the canada - france high - redshift qso survey @xcite .",
    "the subaru high - redshift qso survey has also discovered some faint agns at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "high - redshift agn detections in the x - ray band are also exciting . from the _ xmm - newton _ medium - sensitivity survey ,",
    "@xcite have derived agn lfs ( @xmath19 ) which can be described by a luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model .",
    "the agn lf at @xmath20 obtained from a faint _ chandra _ sample has been reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found the high space density of low - luminosity agns at @xmath21 from the 2 ms _ chandra _ deep survey and the aegis - x 200 ks survey .",

    "the number density evolution of obscured agns has been mentioned by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "agns with column densities above @xmath22 are denoted as `` compton thick '' , and these heavily obscured agns represent a key phase of agn - host galaxy co - evolution .",
    "it is quite interesting that two compton - thick agns have been discovered in the _",
    "xmm_-_newton _ deep survey ( @xmath23 ) and the 4 ms _ chandra _ deep field ( cdf ) survey ( @xmath24 ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the compton - thick agn surveys have been done by @xcite and @xcite . the agn number density and the cosmic x - ray background",
    "have been studied with large observational samples @xcite .",
    "some problems with the agn lf have been raised by these new observations .",
    "for example , at @xmath25 , a flattening feature at @xmath26 seen in the optical agn lf @xcite was explained by the physics of central bh growth and agn / supernova feedback @xcite . however , the number density of faint optical agns ( @xmath27 ) reported by @xcite is about 10 times larger than that of @xcite . with additional spectral identifications , @xcite",
    "re - built the agn lf at @xmath28 .",
    "however , the number density of these faint agns is still two times that given by @xcite .",
    "this observational discrepancy was also mentioned by @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for this discrepancy is as follows @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the qso spectral template of @xcite , which empirically determines a distribution of continua blueward of ly@xmath29 , and the power - law spectral template has a slope of 0.7 ; @xcite had the qso spectral library template modified by a composite using the gaussian distribution of power - law continua , and a slope of 0.5 is given in the spectral template . if the sample selected by @xcite has better completeness than that selected by @xcite , the flattening feature given by @xcite would be significantly reduced . while masters et al .",
    "( 2012 ) built the optical lfs at @xmath30 from the cosmos survey field .",
    "the space density of faint agns at @xmath2 is lower than the result of glikman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) by a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "they suggested that this discrepancy may be due to the contamination of dwarf stars and high - z galaxies in the sample of glikman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and spectroscopic follow - up identification is still challenging for this contamination constraint .",
    "therefore , the final high - redshift agn candidates are different due to different selection functions .",
    "although the agn lf at @xmath3 has been extended to the faint end of @xmath32 , it seems that the agn lf is still steep at the faint end @xcite .",
    "one widely accepted issue of agn evolution is that the agn and its host galaxy have co - evolution characteristics @xcite .",
    "a strong correlation was found between the central bh mass @xmath33 of a normal galaxy and the velocity dispersion @xmath1 of a galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "this @xmath12 relation ( presented as @xmath34 , where @xmath29 and @xmath35 are fitting parameters ) is also valid for the agn population @xcite .",
    "a correlation between a bh mass @xmath33 and the galactic spheroid mass @xmath36 @xcite also indicates the co - evolution feature of agns and their host galaxies .",
    "moreover , the @xmath12 relation evolves with redshift , and the ratio between the @xmath33 and @xmath36 increases with redshift @xcite .",
    "these evolution properties provide the possibility that the central bh growth could finish before its host spheroid formation . in other words ,",
    "massive bhs grow rapidly in the early universe without commensurate growth of their host galaxies @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "schulze & wisotzki ( 2014 ) performed a fitting procedure of the bh - bulge relation with the monte carlo simulation test , in which the observational selection effects were considered .",
    "they did not find any cosmological evolution of the bh - bulge relation when the selection effects were corrected . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite suggested that the circular velocity @xmath37 of a dark matter halo potential well can be linked to the velocity dispersion @xmath1 of a galactic bulge , and the theoretical relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath37 was also examined by observational data @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can link the physical processes of dark matter halos to those of baryons at a certain redshift .",
    "theoretical investigations of co - evolution have been carried out between central bhs and their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted the velocity dispersion functions of spheroid galaxies at @xmath38 .",
    "their results indicate a redshift evolution of the @xmath12 relation .",
    "similar evidence for the evolution of the @xmath12 relation was given by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the redshift evolution of a @xmath39 was also modeled @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a qso evolution model in which massive bhs are formed inside virialized dark matter halos .",
    "agn lfs were studied within the framework of co - evolution between central bhs and their host galaxies , and the bh accretion history was explored in detail @xcite . a linear relation between a dark matter halo mass and bh mass",
    "was used to derive the agn lf @xcite , and the processes of bh self - regulated growth were also considered @xcite .",
    "several complicated models of qso activity , including the bh accretion process @xcite and the bh merger process @xcite , were given as well . from numerical simulations , @xcite proposed a luminosity - dependent agn lifetime to reproduce the agn lfs .",
    "the agn / supernova feedback processes were used to explain the observational downsizing feature of the agns / bhs @xcite .",
    "@xcite noticed that agn shining occurs after dark matter halo virialization due to the growth of a central bh seed .",
    "thus , a time delay between dark matter halo virialization and agn shining should be considered . in this case , super - eddington accretion is important for the central bh growth .",
    "based on a semi - analytic model of the co - evolution between bhs and their hosts , fanidakis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) investigated the agn evolution , considering both the thin - disk accretion and the adaf model .",
    "the optical and x - ray agn lfs were reproduced when the agn obscuration form of hasinger ( 2008 ) was taken into account .",
    "this model predicted a hierarchical buildup of bh mass , but the downsizing feature for different agn populations was clearly shown due to the different accretion modes and the agn obscuration .",
    "hirschmann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) comprehensively investigated some accretion modes .",
    "standard accretion , varing sub - eddington limit for the maximum accretion , and disk instability accretion were considered .",
    "the bh seed mass for the merger process was also considered .",
    "a cosmological numerical simulation for the bh growth was performed by hirschmann et al .",
    "the downsizing feature of the agn number density evolution was well explained when the gas density nearby the massive bh was included in their model .",
    "thus , the processes of star formation and agn / supernova feedback should be also involved .",
    "the star formation process was further explored by enoki et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . in their semi - analytic model ,",
    "the starburst is caused by an agn merger , and the cold gas accretion triggers agn shining .",
    "the amount of cold gas for the bh accretion decreases with cosmic time , and the agn lifetime decreases with redshift . then , the downsizing trend of the agn evolution is shown . from above theoretical models , the observed downsizing feature of the agn evolution",
    "can also be explained under the framework of the hierarchical structure formation .",
    "some research efforts have been attempted toward explaining the faint end of the high - redshift agn lfs .",
    "@xcite determined the bolometric agn lf at @xmath38 using a large set of agn lfs in different rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "the faint - end slope of the agn lf was confirmed .",
    "@xcite comprehensively studied bolometric lfs through the arrangements of bh accretion , radiative efficiency of agns , and agn clustering .",
    "however , it was pointed out by @xcite that those lfs built by @xcite and @xcite overestimated the number density of faint agns at @xmath40 . for instance , in a luminosity range of @xmath41 , the agn number density calculated by @xcite is about five times larger than those given by @xcite and @xcite . moreover",
    ", the predictions of high - redshift agn number counts in the x - ray band are also uncertain .",
    "@xcite proposed a dark matter halo merger model to drive agn shining .",
    "@xcite constructed a semi - analytic model of the co - evolution between bhs and host galaxies .",
    "it was assumed that central bhs continuously accrete surrounding hot gas for agn shining . as reported by @xcite , at @xmath8 , with a flux limit of @xmath9 in the @xmath13 kev band , an optimistic detection of @xmath42 agns per @xmath7 and a pessimistic detection of @xmath43 16 agns per @xmath7",
    "were predicted by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . because many obscured low - luminosity agns can be found at high redshifts @xcite , high - redshift agn detections in the x - ray band are strongly encouraged by some satellite proposals .",
    "for example , the wide field x - ray telescope ( wfxt ) can perform deep observations in 100 @xmath7 to a flux limit of @xmath44 in the @xmath10 kev band @xcite .",
    "those unobscured agns beyond redshift 6 can be effectively detected .",
    "some obscured agns can also be explored up to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , modeling predictions of the high - redshift agn number density in the x - ray band could also be important for future missions .",
    "the ultravoilet photons emitted by agns can effectively ionize the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "high - redshift agn lfs are used to study cosmic reionization .",
    "the so - called gunn - peterson trough @xcite seen in the optical spectra of the sdss agn sample provides excellent evidences to constrain the cosmic reionization epoch @xcite .",
    "it was estimated by @xcite that the qso contribution to the ionizing background is less than 30% of the star - forming galaxy contribution .",
    "the agn contribution to the cosmic reionization @xcite was revisited by @xcite . however , the subaru high - redshift quasar survey has shown that the agns at redshift 6 still do not have enough photons to ionize the universe @xcite . in this paper , as a consequent issue of the high - redshift agn evolution , some rough estimations for the cosmic reionization are given .",
    "we build a simple analytic model to study high - redshift agn evolution within the framework of joint evolution between central bhs and their host galaxies .",
    "beginning from the dark matter halo mass function , we derive the agn lfs by applying the @xmath12 and @xmath45 relations .",
    "high - redshift agn number counts in the x - ray band are obtained as well .",
    "we compare our results to those observational data .",
    "the cosmic reionization is also examined . in our physical recipe ,",
    "the eddington ratio @xmath46 , agn lifetime @xmath47 , @xmath29 , and @xmath35 in the @xmath12 relation , are free parameters ( see table 1 for details ) .",
    "all of these parameters are within their observational constraints .",
    "we do not perform optimized fittings to those observational agn lf data by adjusting the parameters in our model . instead",
    ", we choose reasonable values for these parameters to produce the agn lfs and agn number counts by comparison with the observational data .",
    "thus , some related physical processes can be further explored .",
    "section 2.1 describes our physical model .",
    "the agn lfs and agn number counts are derived in section 2.2 . in section 3",
    ", the contributions from the high - redshift agns to the cosmic reionization are estimated .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in sections 4 and 5 , respectively . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "agn lf is one of the powerful tools to investigate central bh accretion and host galaxy evolution .",
    "some examples of the agn lf formulism have been derived @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we derive the agn lf as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass of a dark matter halo , @xmath33 is the mass of a bh , @xmath53 is the luminosity in a certain observational band , @xmath54 is the dark matter halo mass function .",
    "we further calculate the time derivative of @xmath54 ( sasaki 1994 ; kitayama & suto 1996 ) .",
    "the result contains two terms , which are formation and destruction terms . here",
    ", we only keep the formation term written as @xmath55 and ignore the destruction term .",
    "therefore , it is assumed that an agn is formed inside a newly formed dark matter halo at a certain redshift , and the dark matter halo merger effect is not included in our model .",
    "we also assume that dark matter halos are virialized to harbor agns .",
    "the relation of @xmath52 and @xmath33 is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath0 is the circular velocity of the dark matter halo potential well , and @xmath1 is the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy .",
    "the agn lifetime @xmath47 is far less than the cosmic time .",
    "therefore , to derive agn lf , seven physical issues are involved in our procedure : the dark matter halo formation rate and the @xmath57 relation are related to the dark matter halo mass function and the dark matter halo potential well , respectively ; the @xmath45 relation is applied to link the dark matter halo mass to the bh mass ; the @xmath12 relation indicates the relation between the central bh and the host galaxy ; the bh accretion is related to the physical properties of the central bh ; the bolometric correction should be considered when we transfer bolometric luminosity to a specific luminosity in the optical / x - ray band ; and the agn lifetime is the agn shining timescale in either the optical or x - ray band . in the following subsections , we describe these physical points adopted in our model in detail .",
    "the dark matter halo mass function @xmath54 at a certain redshift can be described by the press - schechter function @xcite . here",
    ", we use the @xmath54 form given by @xcite , which is more accurate than the press - schechter function at high - redshift @xcite .",
    "the dark matter halo formation rate @xmath55 can also be calculated @xcite .",
    "the circular velocity of the dark matter halo can be obtained as @xmath58 @xcite . with a certain density profile of the dark matter halo",
    ", @xcite extrapolated @xmath0 from the virial radius of a dark matter halo to the effective radius of a galaxy , and a factor of @xmath59 was multiplied to this circular velocity at the effective radius .",
    "the final result was regarded as the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "we use their results and choose the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile of the dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "thus , an approximation relation @xmath60 is obtained .",
    "this theoretical result is consistent with the linear fit of @xmath61 from the observational data @xcite . applying this theoretical @xmath45 relation and",
    "the @xmath12 relation described in the next subsection , we can link the dark matter halo mass to the bh mass .",
    "we use the @xmath45 relation to link the bh mass and dark matter halo mass . however , some data points from the @xmath1 and @xmath0 measurements of bulgeless galaxies @xcite have a strong deviation to the previous @xmath45 relation given by @xcite . here , we mention that the bh mass considered in this paper is larger than @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "most bulgeless galaxies selected in the work of @xcite have a velocity dispersion less than @xmath64 .",
    "this velocity dispersion put a constraint on the central bh mass , which is less than @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , these low - mass central bhs and related low - mass galaxies are not within our consideration of agn lfs and agn number counts .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that low - mass bulgeless galaxies are unlikely to host central bhs .",
    "furthermore , @xcite re - examined those observational data .",
    "they reported that the @xmath66 correlation may be as strong as the @xmath12 relation .",
    "thus , we think that the correlation between the central bh and dark matter halo is valid to derive the agn lfs and agn number counts at high redshifts . in the following subsections ,",
    "we focus on the physical processes of both central bhs and their host galaxies , which are related to agn lfs .",
    "central bh accretion and agn activity are strongly related to the agn environment and host galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "our agn lf model is within the framework of co - evolution between agns and their host galaxies .",
    "some important issues in our model are the @xmath12 relation , bh accretion , bolometric correction , and agn lifetime . to derive the agn lfs , the @xmath12 relation is required .",
    "this relation with a form of @xmath67 was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "it indicates a strong co - evolution between central bhs and their host galaxies .",
    "because the agn feedback has been considered , the form of @xmath68 can be derived @xcite . in principle , because the @xmath12 relation originates from a dynamic process , it should be independent of the observational wavelength .",
    "@xcite examined the @xmath12 relation with the numerical simulation model . in their model , the circular velocity @xmath0 is derived from the nfw dark matter halo profile .",
    "a certain gas fraction is given in each halo , and the bh seed grows through bondi accretion .",
    "especially , the feedback from both supernova and accreting bh is included .",
    "the final @xmath12 relation can be derived from a large set of hydrodynamic simulations with additional physics , such as the equation of state of the interstellar medium , galactic surface mass density , and dark matter concentration .",
    "therefore , the @xmath12 relation of @xmath69 computed by @xcite is used in our model to reproduce the agn lfs in the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "it is worth noting that this relation is dependent on the redshift . as mentioned in section 1 ,",
    "the modeling results and the observational measurements for the @xmath12 relation are roughly consistent .",
    "however , the observational @xmath12 relation has an intrinsic scatter of @xmath70 dex @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath12 relation in detail and re - examined the @xmath12 relation using updated data .",
    "as mentioned in their paper , there are systematic uncertainties when measuring the bh mass in a host galaxy . in this paper",
    ", we consider the effect of this intrinsic scatter in the @xmath12 relation .",
    "the best - fit of the @xmath12 relation from @xcite is @xmath71 .",
    "the intrinsic root - mean - square scatter of @xmath72 is given as @xmath73 , and this intrinsic scatter is assumed to be independent of @xmath1 . taking into account the effect from this intrinsic scatter of the observational @xmath12 relation , we can reproduce the agn lfs again .",
    "thus , two kinds of agn lfs , one derived by adopting a theoretical @xmath12 relation and the other by adopting an observational @xmath12 relation with an intrinsic scatter , are compared .",
    "the accretion property of the central bh is a key point to produce the agn bolometric luminosity .",
    "the eddington ratio of accretion is defined by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the bolometric luminosity , and @xmath76 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "the value of @xmath46 has a wide distribution with its peak range from 0.01 to 1 @xcite . in the sub - eddington accretion case of @xmath77 ,",
    "the bolometric agn lf modeled by @xcite is about three to five times larger than observational ones at @xmath40 within a luminosity range of @xmath41 @xcite . while the eddington ratio has been constrained as @xmath78 at @xmath40 by the observations of @xcite and @xcite . to investigate this problem ,",
    "we try two accretion modes .",
    "we first adopt a sub - eddington accretion of @xmath79 to reproduce the agn lfs and agn number counts in general .",
    "we also adopt a mode of @xmath80 to particularly reproduce the optical agn lfs at @xmath81 .",
    "the accretion mode as a function of bh mass was proposed by shankar et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "although the low - mass bh growth at low redshift is suppressed with this accretion mode , the growth of high - mass bhs at high redshift can be well estimated .",
    "shankar et al . ( 2009b ) got somewhat better fits to the bh mass function in general with this accretion mode . from the observational point of view ,",
    "most detected high - redshift agns have massive bhs with high accretion rates . in order to reproduce high - redshift agn lfs",
    ", we focus on high - mass bhs with high accretion ratios . thus",
    ", this accretion mode is adopted in our task . in section 4 ,",
    "we further provide observational constraints and physical explanations on the accretion modes adopted in this work .",
    "we perform the bolometric corrections , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , to convert the bolometric luminosity @xmath84 to the b - band luminosity @xmath85 and the x - ray luminosity @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "@xcite determined two observational values , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , for broad - line agns .",

    "the template spectrum of @xcite constructed by the intrinsic agn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) enables us to precisely determine the agn luminosities in different energy bands .    the agn e - folding time given by the salpeter timescale @xcite",
    "is usually considered as the agn lifetime . from agn clustering measurements ,",
    "we can obtain the agn lifetime with a wide range from @xmath62 to @xmath94 years @xcite .",
    "@xcite took the value of @xmath95 yrs as the agn lifetime for high - redshift qsos . in the agn - host galaxy joint evolution framework",
    ", we suggest different agn lifetimes for different observational energy bands . at the initial coevolutionary stage of the central bhs and their host galaxies",
    ", agn x - ray emission can be detected , but agn optical emission is still fully absorbed . at a later stage , the agn can be observed in the optical band when the agn surrounding medium is transparent .",
    "thus , the lifetime of the x - ray selected agns could be longer than that of the optically selected agns . here ,",
    "we take @xmath96 and @xmath97 years as reference values for the agn lifetime to calculate the optical and x - ray agn lfs , respectively .",
    "we take an exceptional case , in which the agn lifetime is given as @xmath4 yrs , to reproduce the optical agn lfs at @xmath81 .      assuming a sub - eddington accretion of @xmath98 , we use the @xmath57 , @xmath45 , and @xmath12 relations to derive the agn lfs .",
    "as mentioned in section 2.1 , these relations adopted in our calculations are obtained from theoretical works .",

    "we assume that the escape fraction of agns is the same as that of high - redshift galaxies . in summary",

    "after sufficient central bh growth and star formation , central bhs shine as typical agns , and the agn environment is transparent .",
    "ionizing photons emitted from agns may dominate the second stage of the cosmic reionization .",
    "accretion is one of the key points for agn shining . as mentioned in section 1 , with the sub - eddington accretion of @xmath162",
    ", @xcite overestimated the number density of faint agns in the luminosity range of @xmath41 at @xmath40 .",
    "we know that the qsos at @xmath40 found by @xcite and @xcite have an eddington ratio close to the eddington limit . in this paper ,",
    "if we increase the eddington ratio to the eddington limit and decrease the agn lifetime to @xmath4 yrs , we can reproduce the optical agn lf at @xmath40 .",
    "this indicates that bhs with a mass of @xmath163 accreting in the eddington limit at @xmath40 can form very young qsos .",
    "although we use a single eddington ratio per bh mass , we realize that the accretion history during bh growth is related to the eddington ratio ( granato et al .",
    "shen ( 2009 ) investigated the bh growth in detail taking into consideration the evolution of the eddington ratio .",
    "aird et al . (",
    "2012 ) reported an observational distribution of the eddington ratio , which is an universal function with a power - law shape .",
    "thus , rather than a single eddington ratio per bh mass , the eddington ratio distribution should be taken into account when modeling the agn lfs . in our model",
    ", we use the single eddington ratio form without any distribution function .",
    "we ignore complicated bh accretion processes during bh growth , and we think that the single eddingtion accretion mode corresponds to the peak of the agn lightcurve . furthermore , because we find the agn  flicker \" phase at high redshift , it is reasonable that the peak of the agn light curve occurs over the time of the agn `` flicker '' phase .",
    "this peak/flicker \" time is much shorter than the averaged agn lifetime .",
    "therefore , the single accretion mode without any distribution scatter is helpful to explore the agn short - time variability / burst given by novak et al .",

    "( 2015 ) .",
    "we propose a possible lifetime of @xmath112 yrs for the optical agns at @xmath81 , and these high - redhsift optical agns are younger than those in previous studies .",
    "for example , bolton et al . (",
    "2011 ) provided the observational agn bright phase at @xmath8 , and the agn lifetime was constrained as @xmath164 yrs . here , we further summarize some physical possibilities regarding on the agn lifetime .",
    "there have been more high - redshift ( @xmath81 ) agn findings ( reed et al . 2015 ; venemans et al . 2015",

    "novak et al .",
    "( 2011 ) performed two - dimensional simulations to study the time - dependence of bh accretion , and the agn light curve within an agn phase of 250 myr can be divided by many short bursts with a typical timescale of @xmath166 yrs .",

    "they proposed that the timescale of 100 myr corresponds to an average number of the whole bh accretion , while instantaneous luminosity corresponds to a variability with a much shorter timescale . very recently , schawinski et al .",
    "( 2015 ) observationally defined the agn lifetime , which is the ratio between the time to photoionize a host galaxy and the fraction of optically elusive agns . due to the arguments on the switch - on ( high - accretion rate ) and switch - off ( low - accretion rate ) processes , schawinski et al .",
    "( 2015 ) claimed that the agn ",
    "flicker \" duration is @xmath166 yrs based on the _ swift_-bat and sdss samples .",
    "we think that their results can support an agn lifetime number on the order of @xmath167 years adopted in our model for those eddington - limited agns at @xmath81 . in our model ,",
    "the agn lifetimes at different redshifts have different numbers .",
    "the agn lifetime of @xmath111 yrs is used in our model to reproduce the agn lf at @xmath28 . if we take the  flicker \" scenario given by schawinski et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , we think that the agn lifetime with an order of @xmath168 yrs indicates an averaged agn activity process with sub - eddington accretion . at @xmath81",
    ", we do not have enough observational data , and the observational agn lf spreads in a relatively small range of luminosity .",
    "if we reproduce the optical agn lf using the eddington - limited accretion at @xmath81 , the  flicker \" agn lifetime of @xmath112 yrs in the bh growth scenario can be understood as the time of the instantaneous agn activity .",
    "we also speculate ( 1 ) there are enough gas clumps surrounding the central bh to fuel agn shining at high redshift , so that the accretion rate is high , and we could identify violent short - time bursts of agns , and ( 2 ) at low - redshift , there are fewer gas clumps surrounding the central bh , so that the accretion rate is low , and we observe many agns without any violent short - time bursts .",
    "thus , we emphasize that the general agn lifetime is much longer than the lifetime of short - time bursts .",
    "the agn / supernova kinetic feedback effects are strongly involved in the galaxy formation and evolution : ( 1 ) heating the surrounding gas of a central bh and quenching the star formation of a galaxy bulge and ( 2 ) blowing away the surrounding gas of a central bh and stopping further bh growth . in particular",
    ", we note that the agn feedback dominates in massive dark matter halos while the supernova feedback is effective in small dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "we further discuss the feedback effect of supernovae on the faint end of the agn lf mentioned by @xcite and @xcite : a small dark matter halo potential well is not deep enough to contain cooling baryons if we consider supernova feedback , and further bh growth is not expected . hence , there are no more low - mass bhs in small dark matter halos , and agn lfs show a flattening feature at the faint end",
    ". however , this reasonable explanation is challenged by the optical agn lf at @xmath2 @xcite . the agn lf given by @xcite",
    "does not show the flattening feature , indicating more faint agns in the high - redshift universe was reported by @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the measurement of @xcite is 2 - 3 mag deeper than that of @xcite . ] .",
    "although it is likely that the supernova feedback effect on agn lfs reported by @xcite and @xcite is overestimated , we note that masters et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also presented the flattening feature at the faint end of the agn lf .",
    "moreover , strong supernova feedback can blow away the material surrounding a central bh , while the material surrounding a central bh may exist when the supernova feedback is weak .",
    "thus , weak supernova feedback can also be one possible reason that low - luminosity agns harbored in small dark matter halos suffer strong attenuation . in order to obtain quantitative results ,",
    "some star formation and evolution processes , including the initial mass function and the star formation rate , should be explored in the future .",
    "although we assume that bh accretion dominates the agn evolution process , bh merger effects should be estimated .",
    "we assume that one bh is inside one dark matter halo , and the dark matter halo merger is followed by the central bh merger .",
    "then , we can apply a simple treatment reported by @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the bh merger is given as @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the probability of the bh merging with equal - mass bh , @xmath171 is the hubble time , and @xmath172 is the dark matter halo merging timescale .",
    "we assume @xmath173 . from an investigation of the bh / dark matter halo merger @xcite",
    ", we can obtain the value of @xmath174 .",
    "the variation of the bh mass function is @xmath175 .",
    "finally , we obtain the bh merger effect on agn lfs . as an example , in the case in which the dark matter halo has a mass of @xmath176 , the bh merger effect provides variations of 17% and 15% on the agn lfs at @xmath28 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the variation of bh accretion caused by the bh merger can be ignored @xcite .",
    "besides these simple estimations mentioned above , in the following , we discuss some complicated issues .",
    "the so - called `` dry merger '' , which refers to the dark matter halo merger without baryons , has been put forward @xcite . in this case ,",
    "bhs do not merge even if dark matter halos have merging processes .",
    "this is one reason that not all of the major mergers end up with massive early - type galaxies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dark matter halo merging timescale and the incoming bh merging timescale were studied by @xcite and @xcite . at high - redshift , bhs sink to the center of the merged dark matter halo before bh merging .",
    "therefore , at high redshift , binary bhs or triple bhs can stay in the same host galaxy .",
    "thus , the @xmath12 relation should be revisited .",
    "these interesting topics are the next step in the future research .",
    "the predictions of high - redshift agn detection are helpful for future x - ray mission proposals .",
    "the wfxt deep survey can cover an observational area of 100 @xmath7 ( rosati et al .",
    "2010 ) . in our model ,",
    "to the flux limit of @xmath44 in the @xmath10 kev band , we predict that @xmath4330 agns per @xmath7 with the absorption of @xmath177 can be detected at @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "high - redshift agn detections have been investigated by other theoretical models as well . at @xmath8 , to the flux limit of @xmath9 in the @xmath13 kev band , optimistic detection of @xmath42 agns per @xmath7 and pessimistic detection of @xmath43 16 agns per @xmath7 were predicted by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "although marulli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) successfully predicted the general bh mass function , they underestimated the number density of high - z bright agns when they used a constant eddington accretion .",
    "while rhook & haehnelt ( 2008 ) extrapolated their merger - driven accretion model to high redshift for bh growth scenarios , and the predicted agn numbers were sensitive on the early bh growth history . in our model , the bh accretion is adjusted by the bh mass .",
    "the value predicted in our model is two times larger than the value of @xcite , but @xmath178 times smaller than the value of @xcite .",
    "all of these high - redshift predictions can be well verified by future observations .",
    "we use a simple analytical model to study the high - redshift agn evolution in this paper .",

    "it seems possible that these agns at @xmath40 are very young .",
    "we calculate the x - ray agn lfs at @xmath5 and the x - ray agn number counts at @xmath6 using the same parameters adopted for the calculation of the optical agn lfs at @xmath2 .",
    "we estimate that , at @xmath8 , there are about 30 agns per @xmath7 to the flux limit of @xmath9 in the @xmath10 kev band .",
    "high - redshift agns with central masses less than @xmath181 may dominate the cosmic reionization , though this domination is strongly dependent on the agn lf , clumping factor , and escape fraction of ionizing photons .",
    "although our agn lfs and agn number counts at high redshifts have uncertainties that originate from the @xmath12 relation , eddington ratio , agn lifetime , and x - ray attenuation , they can be further constrained by optical and x - ray observations ( subaru / pfs , wfxt , erosita ) in the future .",
    "the observational data are kindly provided by j. aird , a. bongiorno , m. brusa , f. fontanot , e. glikman , and l. jiang .",
    "j. m. is grateful to x .- b .",
    "wu , y. lu , w. zuo , f. fontanot , and y. ueda for their useful discussion .",

    "m. k. was supported by basic science research program through the national research foundation ( nrf ) of korea funded by the ministry of education , science and technology ( 2012 - 0001787 ) .",
    "the observed agn number counts in the x - ray band given by @xcite and @xcite are related to the observed x - ray flux .",
    "both the absorption @xmath182 and the flux density of the x - ray spectrum in a given redshift should be determined to transform from intrinsic number counts to observed number counts .    in order to study the absorption feature of x - ray selected agns and obtain high - redshift agn number counts in the x - ray band",
    ", we should investigate x - ray spectral templates at high redshifts .",
    "the model with command `` @xmath183 '' can be used in xspec ( version 12 ) , as we assume that the spectrum can be fitted by an absorbed power - law .",
    "the galactic absorption is taken as @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "we assume a photon index @xmath185 @xcite in the absorbed power - law spectrum .",
    "we show the x - ray spectra at redshifts 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 in figure 12 . meanwhile , the spectra with the intrinsic absorption values of @xmath186 are also given .",
    "the normalized fluxes in the @xmath10 kev band with a certain @xmath182 can be obtained from the above spectral fitting . using these spectral results ,",
    "we quantitatively calculate the absorbed x - ray fluxes at high redshifts . finally , as described in section 2.2.2 ,",
    "the observed agn number counts in the x - ray band can be derived .",
    "although we focus on high - redshift agn lfs and agn number counts , we pay attention to the ratio of bh mass to dark matter halo mass and the ratio of bh mass to baryonic mass under the framework of joint evolution between agns and their host galaxies .",
    "we transfer dark matter halo mass to baryonic mass by a factor of 0.16 .",
    "we show the plots of the bh@xmath187halo mass relation and the bh - baryon mass relation in figures 13 and 14 , respectively . in each figure , the cases of redshift 4 , 6 , 8 , and 9.5 are given .",
    "the different forms of the @xmath12 relation and the @xmath12 relation scatters are adopted in the calculations .",
