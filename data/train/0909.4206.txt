    "high temperature superconductor ( htsc ) films are suitable candidates for the improvement of microwave receiver performance because of their low surface resistance.@xcite the surface impedance of htsc materials presents a strong dependence on the magnitude of the incident microwave magnetic field , @xmath4 .",
    "typically , a nonlinear behavior is observed above a certain value of @xmath4 .",
    "this nonlinearity leads to unacceptable microwave power losses .",
    "microwave losses are characterized by a decrease of the quality factor @xmath5 of superconducting resonators and filters and a downward shift of the resonant frequency of the former.@xcite the surface impedance of htsc has been studied by many groups , using either the dielectric resonator technique or the stripline resonator technique . in spite of numerous experimental studies",
    "the physical origin of the observed nonlinearities is still under debate and the subject of present - day experimental investigation.@xcite    it has been proposed that a simple way to differentiate among the mechanisms of nonlinearity of the surface impedance is the examination of the @xmath6 parameter.@xcite this quantity is defined as the ratio between the microwave field dependence of the surface reactance @xmath7 and of the surface resistance @xmath8 ,    @xmath9    table 1 gives an overview of possible mechanisms leading to the nonlinear behavior of the surface impedance.@xcite first is the intrinsic nonlinearity due to pair - breaking . the nonlinearity is then related to the increase of the quasi - particle density @xmath10 @xcite when the @xmath4-induced current density is of the order of magnitude of the pair - breaking current density .",
    "a nonlinearity based on this effect has been predicted and investigated using a phenomenological expression for a nonlinear penetration depth .",
    "if the nonlinearity is dominated by this intrinsic mechanism , the @xmath6-parameter should be small and strongly frequency - dependent .",
    "this differs from the experimentally observed nonlinearities .",
    "hysteretic losses are also proposed to be signifiant.@xcite the weakly coupled - grain model holds that the large surface resistance of highly granular high - t@xmath11 superconductors as compared to single crystals can be explained by the different morphology .",
    "the polycrystaline samples can be modeled as a network of josephson junctions .",
    "nonlinear behavior is expected at rf - current densities that are limited by critical current density of the constituant josephson junctions .",
    "this model yields a very small @xmath6-parameter with a strong dependence on temperature and frequency . in the case of granular films",
    "the coupled - grain model describes the microwave nonlinearities fairly well .",
    "nevertheless , it fails to describe strong nonlinearities in epitaxial films",
    ". vortex penetration and creep into grain boundaries and/or weak links are also proposed as a possible source of microwave hysteretic losses .",
    "vortex generation by the microwave magnetic field has been predicted @xcite and the bean model has been extented to account for microwave nonlinearity in htsc films .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath13 is almost linear ( with slope @xmath6 ) .",
    "experimental values are close to those predicted by the model .",
    "the last possible effect to explain nonlinearity is local or uniform heating.@xcite it has been proposed that heating can occur in superconducting thin films .",
    "this effect appears in the microwave frequency range , particularly in continuous mode , but also in pulsed mode , as function of the pulse period .",
    "heating is significant above a certain value of the incident microwave power , and causes the transition to the normal state of weaker superconducting regions such as weak links or local defects .",
    "heating and heat transfer to the substrate are shown to play an important role .",
    "we have used the dielectric resonator method in order to measure the surface impedance of yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 thin films from various sources .",
    "we present a study of both the temperature and the microwave power level dependence .",
    "the use of a rutile dielectric resonator allows us to measure the precise temperature of the films .",
    "we show that the usually observed increase of the surface resistance of yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 thin films as a function of microwave power is due to local heating .",
    "measurements of the surface impedance @xmath14 were performed on a series of yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 thin films , denoted sy211 and obtained at thales by inverted cylindical hollow cathode dc sputtering . a second series , labelled tm mgo and tm lao , was acquired from theva inc ..",
    "@xcite this series was prepared by reactive thermal evaporation .",
    "@xmath15 was measured by the dielectric resonator method.@xcite the film thicknesses and the critical temperatures as measured by ac - suceptibility are gathered in table 2 .",
    "surface morphology imaging is shown in fig . 1 for the three studied samples .",
    "x - ray diffraction , using a bragg - brentano diffractometer , showed all films to be epitaxial with the [ 001 ] orientation .",
    "for the surface impedance measurements , we have used a cylindrically shaped rutile resonator of height 1 mm and diameter 7 mm , which is directly placed onto the sample .",
    "the resonant frequency in the @xmath16 mode is near 10 ghz .",
    "rutile is well - known for its small tangent loss ( @xmath17 at 77 k , 10 ghz ) and its very high dielectric constant ( @xmath18 = 105 at 77 k).@xcite the resonator is excited by an adjustable coupling loop ; the distance between the resonator and the loop is controlled in order to maintain critical coupling during the experiment .",
    "the whole assembly is placed inside an oxygen - free high conductivity copper cavity , mounted onto a cryocooler cold head .",
    "temperature stability is better than 1 mk over the range 30 k-90 k.    for each sample , we measure the resonant frequency @xmath19 and the loaded @xmath5-factor of the fundamental resonance of the resonator . at each microwave input power level",
    ", the reflection coefficient from the resonator , or @xmath20 parameter , is measured with a network analyser in continuous mode , coupled to a microwave amplifier for the high power regime .",
    "this experimental set - up allows us to measure the surface impedance over a input microwave power ranging from 0.01 mw to 100 mw .",
    "the loaded @xmath5-factor of the resonator is given by :    @xmath21    where @xmath19 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the resonant frequency and the -3 db bandwidth in log scale corresponding to the resonant peak , see fig .",
    "the unloaded @xmath5-factor is defined by :    @xmath23    with @xmath24 the coupling constant .",
    "all measurements were performed under critical coupling _",
    "i.e _ @xmath25 , and the unloaded @xmath5-factor @xmath26 .",
    "the inverse @xmath27 is the sum of different contributions due to the resonator itself , the copper cavity , and the yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 thin film , such that    @xmath28    here @xmath29 is due to the dielectric losses , @xmath30 to the microwave losses in the copper , and @xmath31 arises from the microwave losses in the yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 film .",
    "the geometrical factors a=0.9871 , b=1.75.@xmath32 , c=3.665.@xmath33 are calculated using a numerical simulation ( hfss software @xcite ) .",
    "the surface resistance is obtained as    @xmath34",
    "in order to understand the variation of the @xmath5-factor and the resonant frequency with increasing microwave power , we have measured the temperature dependence of the resonator s properties .",
    "3(a ) represents the temperature dependence of the tio@xmath1 resonator resonant frequency in the limit of small microwave power @xmath35 , for three different configurations .",
    "in the first configuration , the tio@xmath1 resonator is directly placed on the copper cavity ; in the second , the resonator is placed on an mgo substrate ; finally the resonator is placed on the yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 film , itself deposited on mgo .",
    "the absolute value of the resonant frequency , @xmath19 , depends on the distance between the resonator and the conducting wall of the copper cavity or of the superconducting layer .",
    "the presence of dielectric mgo leads to a lower resonant frequency than the presence of the conducting yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 layer .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of the frequency shift of the rutile resonator does not depend on the nature of the support .",
    "this shows that the thermal conductivity between the cryocooler cold - head and the rutile resonator is not significantly affected by the intercalation of the 500 @xmath36m - thick mgo and the 400 @xmath37m - thick superconducting layer .",
    "3(b ) represents the temperature dependence of the resonant frequency shift of the rutile resonator and of a mgo resonator with @xmath19 near 8 ghz .",
    "clearly , the variation with temperature of the mgo resonant frequency is much weaker than that of rutile .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resonant frequency is the direct consequence of the increase ( resp .",
    "decrease ) with temperature of the dielectric constant @xmath38 of rutile ( resp .",
    "mgo ) .    in fig .",
    "4 ( a , b ) we present the surface resistance and the resonant frequency in the presence of the investigated yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 films at a given temperature of 74 k , as function of an effective microwave reactive power .",
    "this is defined by @xmath39 , a parameter introduced to quantitatively compare data obtained on the different films .",
    "namely , each different film leads to a different values of @xmath40 and absorbed power for the same incident microwave power .",
    "the zero power limit is taken as those values of @xmath41 below which @xmath42 is essentially @xmath41-independent .",
    "curves for different films present the same behavior , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath42 and @xmath43 are independent of the microwave field in the zero field limit and become nonlinear ( increase rapidly ) above a threshold value @xmath41 .",
    "contrary to what is expected and usually observed by using sapphire or mgo resonators , the resonant frequency @xmath19 of the rutile resonator also increases with increasing microwave power .",
    "we ascertain that the increase of @xmath43 is due to the heating of the rutile resonator by the yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 film . in order to demonstrate this effect ,",
    "we have also measured the temperature dependence of the surface resistance and resonant frequency in the limit of small @xmath41 . the surface resistance at @xmath44 of the yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 films , shown by the open symbols in fig .",
    "5(a ) , shows the usual monotonous increase with temperature for all samples .",
    "concerning the temperature dependence of the resonant frequency , we observe an increase with temperature , as discussed previously , fig.5(b ) .",
    "the only observed difference is the nearly constant frequency offset between the three curves .    by fitting the @xmath45 curve of fig .",
    "5(b ) and substituting the interpolated values for the @xmath19-values measured in the swept - power experiment depicted in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we estimate the temperature variation @xmath46 of the resonator in the latter . fig .",
    "6 shows the temperature variation of the resonator obtained in this way , at nominal temperatures of 63 k ( a ) and 74 k ( b ) .",
    "7 shows the normalized resonant frequency @xmath19 of the rutile resonator placed on a superconducting layer ( black square ) and on a mgo substrate ( black star ) as a function of the microwave reactive power .",
    "this graph shows that the contribution to the observed nonlinearities arising from the losses in the dielectric material is negligible compared to the losses in the superconductor .",
    "we now compare the @xmath47 data obtained as function of the temperature increase due to increasing dissipation in the swept - power experiments and the low - power @xmath48 data .",
    "5(a ) shows a superposition of @xmath48 obtained from swept - power experiments at nominal temperatures of 63 k and 74 k ( fig . 6 closed symbols ) and the low - power @xmath48 data ( open symbols).the data are perfectly superimposed , this means that no intrinsic @xmath41-dependence of the surface resistance is measured , and that any observed nonlinearity is the consequence of joule heating .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resonant frequency is the direct consequence of the increase with temperature of the dielectric constant @xmath38 of rutile .",
    "note that its behavior is opposite to the decrease with temperature of the dielectric constant of more commonly used sapphire or mgo resonators .",
    "moreover , the variation with temperature of the mgo resonant frequency is much weaker than that of rutile . by consequence , it is difficult to separate the evolution of the intrinsic change of a mgo or sapphire resonator s frequency from that caused by the temperature variation of a superposed superconducting film : both weakly decrease as function of temperature .",
    "however , the intrinsic evolution of the rutile resonator s frequency is opposite to that expected from the presence of the superconducting film .",
    "a measurement of the rutile s resonator frequency can thus unambiguously serve as a local temperature measurement .    in general ,",
    "superconducting thin films contain resistive defects such as conducting precipitates and weak - links of josephson junctions . in their experiments , obara et al .",
    "@xcite show a correlation between the @xmath4-dependence of the surface resistance and the value of the dc critical current density .",
    "their interpretation is these correlations indicate that the power dependence of @xmath12 is due to the intrinsic properties of the films , such as pair - breaking .",
    "however , nonlinearities usually occur at much lower @xmath4 fields than those at which the intrinsic nonlinearities are expected.@xcite halbriter et al .",
    "@xcite show that at very low microwave fields , nonlinearities can be explained by josephson fluxon penetration along weak links ; at higher fields flux flow losses may also participate.@xcite wosik et al .",
    "insist on the importance of thermal effects as the root of the nonlinear behavior.@xcite they have used the pulsed measurement method , which , in principle , prevents or at least reduces heating of the films .",
    "these experiments were repeated using thermally isolated films as well as films that are thermally connected through the substrate with the heat sink cooled at 20 k. the authors@xcite have shown that the temperature increase of an isolated sample can reach 30 k. for the case of a film thermally connected to the heat sink the temperature rise will be of only 2.5 k. +",
    "in our experiment we have clearly shown that the use of the rutile dielectric material is a good way for a direct measurement of the temperature of superconducting thin films , because of the large temperature dependence of the dielectric constant .",
    "the behavior of the resonant frequency , opposite to that of the commonly used sapphire or mgo resonators , indicates that the resonant frequency shift observed as function of the applied microwave power is mainly due to heating of superconducting films .",
    "the perfect superposition of the temperature - dependent surface resistance obtained from swept - power experiments with the temperature dependence of @xmath12 measured in the limit of low microwave power shows that intrinsic nonlinearities of the superconducting films do not contribute to heating .",
    "therefore , joule heating must be due to either flux - flow losses or to quasi - particle resistive losses .",
