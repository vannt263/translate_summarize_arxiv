    "the recent detection of the variable x - ray source , cxo j164710.2 - 455216 , located 1.6 from the core of the young open cluster , westerlund 1 , by muno et al ( 2006 ) can be considered key to understanding the formation history and nature of compact objects in young massive stellar clusters .",
    "cxo j164710.2 - 455216 is the brightest x - ray source in the cluster , radiating at a luminosity of @xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 in the 0.5 - 8 kev energy band and characterized by a pulse period of 10.6 s. based on subsequent xmm - newton observations , israel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and muno et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that the source increased its luminosity to @xmath9 ergs s@xmath8 and exhibited a rapid spin down after an outburst , exhibiting properties that are very reminiscent of highly magnetized neutron stars known as magnetars .",
    "previous spectroscopic and photometric observations of westerlund 1 were carried out by clark et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who showed that the population of massive stars could be understood if the cluster age was @xmath10 myr ( see also crowther et al .",
    "2006 ) , a result which is also consistent with a more recent age determination based on an analysis of its intermediate and low mass stellar content ( brandner et al",
    ". 2008 ) . for an assumed solar metallicity ,",
    "a lower limit for the progenitor mass of cxo j164710.2 - 455216 was estimated to be @xmath0 .",
    "the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of cxo j164710.2 - 455216 is highly desirable in placing limits on its progenitor , however , it is dependent upon whether it evolved in isolation as a single star or as a member of an interacting binary system .",
    "we note that the recent studies by clark et al .",
    "( 2008 ) indicate a high binary fraction , @xmath6 , for the massive wolf rayet star population in westerlund 1 and that a binary evolutionary channel may be very likely .",
    "it is generally inferred from core collapse simulations that single stars more massive than @xmath11 form black holes ( e.g. , fryer 1999 ) .",
    "stars more massive than @xmath11 in binaries are also expected to form black holes in order to explain the galactic black hole transient systems and to satisfy nucleosynthetic constraints ( e.g. , maeder 1992 ; portegies zwart , verbunt & ergma 1997 ; kobulnicky & skillman 1997 ; ergma & van den heuvel 1998 ) .",
    "however , a number of studies have been pointed out that binary interactions can significantly increase the neutron star / black hole mass formation limit .",
    "for example , van den heuvel & habets ( 1984 ) studied the binary lmc x-3 containing a neutron star with a massive companion , and found that stars as massive as @xmath12 may form neutron stars .",
    "kaper et al .",
    "( 1995 ) further increased this limit , estimating a mass of @xmath13 based on the analysis of a binary wray 977 , although it was later demonstrated that such a system could be explained with the much lower mass limit of @xmath14 ( wellstein & langer 1999 ) .",
    "however , wellstein & langer ( 1999 ) reemphasized that , in general , the critical initial mass limits for neutron star / black hole formation in binary systems may be quite different than for single stars and can be as high as @xmath15 .",
    "we point out that , in this regard , brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have noted that the final mass of the compact object may depend upon whether the evolved core was exposed before or after central helium burning .",
    "more recently , fryer et al . (",
    "2002 ) demonstrated that a star of @xmath16 that was stripped of its envelope in a binary system can end up as a neutron star or a massive black hole , depending on the adopted wind mass loss rates during the wolf - rayet stage .",
    "these studies , taken as a whole , indicate that binary interactions can lead to a range of initial stellar masses separating the formation of neutron stars from black holes rather than a single limiting mass .",
    "we use this concept to examine the existence of a neutron star in the very young environment of westerlund 1 .    in this paper , we report on the formation history of neutron stars from very massive progenitors ( @xmath17 ) both as a single star and as a component of an interacting binary system to determine the conditions under which a neutron star in a young cluster such as westerlund 1 can form . in the next section",
    ", we outline the basic assumptions and input parameters of our numerical model as based on the startrack binary population synthesis code ( belczynski et al .",
    "the numerical results are presented for the binary star and single star evolutionary channels in  3 .",
    "the implications of these results for stellar and binary evolution of massive stars , as applied to westerlund 1 , are discussed in the last section .",
    "our population synthesis code , startrack , was initially developed to study double compact object mergers in the context of @xmath18 ray burst progenitors ( belczynski , bulik & rudak 2002b ) and gravitational - wave inspiral sources ( belczynski , kalogera , & bulik 2002a ) . in recent years startrack",
    "has undergone major updates and revisions in the physical treatment of various binary evolution phases , and especially the mass transfer phases . the new version has already been tested and calibrated against observations and detailed binary mass transfer calculations ( belczynski et al .  2008 ) .",
    "it has been used in various applications ( e.g. , belczynski & taam 2004 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2004 ; belczynski , bulik & ruiter 2005 ; belczynski et al . 2006 ; belczynski et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the physics updates that are most important for compact object formation and evolution include : a full numerical approach for the orbital evolution due to tidal interactions , calibrated using high mass x - ray binaries and open cluster observations , a detailed treatment of mass transfer episodes fully calibrated against detailed calculations with a stellar evolution code , updated stellar winds for massive stars , and the latest determination of the natal kick velocity distribution for neutron stars ( hobbs et al .",
    "2005 ) . for helium star evolution , which is of a crucial importance for the formation of double neutron star binaries ( e.g. , ivanova et al .  2003 ; dewi & pols 2003 )",
    ", we have applied a treatment matching closely the results of detailed evolutionary calculations .",
    "if the helium star fills its roche lobe , the systems are examined for the potential development of a dynamical instability , in which case they are evolved through a common envelope ( ce ) phase , otherwise a highly non - conservative mass transfer ensues .",
    "we treat ce events using the energy formalism ( webbink 1984 ) , where the binding energy of the envelope is determined from a set of he star models calculated with the detailed evolutionary code by ivanova et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in case",
    "the ce is initiated by a star crossing the hertzsprung gap ( hg ) we assume a merger and abort further binary evolution .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is no clear core - envelope boundary ( and no entropy jump as for more evolved stars ) in the interior structure of hg donors to facilitate the formation of a remnant binary system . as a consequence , a large decrease in the formation efficiency of close double compact binaries results ( belczynski et al .",
    "rejuvenation is considered in detail following the method presented by tout et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . for a detailed description of the revised code",
    "we refer the reader to belczynski et al .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of @xmath19 massive binaries with our standard evolutionary model ( belczynski et al .",
    "2008 ) for solar metallicity ( @xmath20 ) and an initial mass function ( imf ) with an exponent of @xmath21 for primaries in the mass range @xmath22 .",
    "the secondaries ( @xmath23 ) were chosen from a flat mass ratio ( @xmath24 ) distribution .",
    "the initial separations were chosen from the distribution flat in logarithm ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) limited by the maximum separation of @xmath26 , while eccentricities were chosen from a thermal - equilibrium distribution ( @xmath27 ) .    as a result",
    "we have obtained populations of compact objects , i.e. , white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes , both single and in binaries .",
    "single compact objects were formed upon disruption of a given binary during a supernova explosion either through a natal kick , mass loss or both .",
    "we have used the kick distribution presented by hobbs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) represented by a single maxwellian with @xmath28 km s@xmath8 .",
    "we employed the above distribution in its original form for neutron stars , while the kick velocity was decreased for black holes due to the fall back ( e.g. , fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "the stellar models employed in our population synthesis ( hurley , pols & tout 2000 ) result in an age of westerlund 1 of 5 myr : this is a main sequence lifetime of a @xmath29 star .",
    "actual fits of single stellar models to over 50 massive stars in westerlund 1 resulted in an age estimate of @xmath10 myr ( e.g. , clark et al . 2005 ; brandner et al .",
    "we adopt an age of 5 myr , although we note that any estimate based on single star models is highly uncertain in the case of a cluster like westerlund 1 with the very high content of binaries ( @xmath6 ; clark et al .",
    "2008 ) . at 5 myr",
    "our calculations reveal a population of single neutron stars that originate from disrupted binaries .",
    "_ evolution .",
    "_ in the following we briefly describe a typical evolution leading to the formation of a very young solitary pulsar that originates from a disrupted binary .",
    "the evolution starts on the zams with two massive stars : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , on a rather close @xmath32 and eccentric orbit : @xmath33 .",
    "the primary initiates roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) at @xmath34 myr while still on the main sequence ( main sequence lifetime of an unaffected single star of that mass is @xmath35 myr , and it forms a he core of @xmath36 ) . at the onset of mass transfer ( case a )",
    "the orbit is circularized ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) and the component masses ( depleted by stellar winds ) are @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the mass transfer is stable and proceeds on the nuclear timescale of the primary with rates ranging from @xmath41 .",
    "we assume non - conservative evolution in which half of the mass lost by primary is accreted onto secondary , while the other half leaves the system , carrying away orbital angular momentum . at the end of the primary main sequence phase we note",
    "the mass ratio has reversed ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and the orbit has expanded ( @xmath44 ) . the significant mass loss ( rlof ) on the main sequence leads to the decrease of the central temperature , reducing the rate of hydrogen ( h ) burning in the core of the primary . as a result",
    ", the primary forms a smaller core at the end of the main sequence phase ( new @xmath45 ) and , thus , will form a lower mass compact object . although the lifetime of the primary star increases with the decrease of its core mass , the fact that the mass transfer started late in the main sequence phase does not significantly affect the lifetime of the star ( new @xmath46 myr ) .",
    "the mass transfer continues while the primary is crossing the hg ( case b ) , transferring mass at a high rate @xmath47 such that the entire h - rich envelope is removed and the primary becomes a massive naked helium star with @xmath48 .",
    "the secondary , on the other hand , remains on the main sequence , but with its mass increased to @xmath49 .",
    "mass transfer ceases as massive helium stars are characterized by small radii ( @xmath50 for the primary ) .",
    "thereafter , the primary evolves through the helium star phase , losing more mass via stellar winds and finally exploding in a type ib supernova . at the time of explosion ( @xmath51 )",
    "the primary has a mass of @xmath52 with core mass of @xmath53 .",
    "such a star forms a massive neutron star ( @xmath54 ) as little matter is expected to fall back in such a case ( e.g. , fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "the explosion disrupts the system provided that either a high natal kick or a kick off the orbital plane is applied , releasing the neutron star from the binary .",
    "the massive secondary soon ( @xmath55 myr ) completes its evolution and forms a solitary black hole of @xmath56 .    _ physical properties . _ in figure  1 we show the initial mass distribution of very young pulsar progenitors .",
    "we note that the majority of the progenitors are massive @xmath57 since high initial masses are required in the framework of the above formation channel .",
    "stars must be sufficiently massive to promptly complete their evolution within 5 myr , but not too massive for otherwise black hole formation occurs .",
    "the mass distribution of the very young solitary pulsars formed at @xmath58 myr is also illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "as expected these pulsars are very massive : @xmath59 .",
    "the high mass limit reflects our assumption on the maximum neutron star mass ( @xmath60 ) , whereas the peak at @xmath61 originates from a wide range of progenitor masses .",
    "specifically , our model for single stars has approximately a bimodal distribution of neutron stars masses ; single stars with @xmath62 form @xmath63 , while stars with @xmath64 form @xmath61 .",
    "such a distribution was adopted following the study of timmes , woosley & weaver ( 1996 ) , which showed bimodality in the core mass of massive stars reflecting the differences in the entropy of their core regions .",
    "therefore , since our scenario preferentially selects the most massive stars that form neutron stars the peak exists at @xmath61 , while there are virtually no neutron stars with @xmath65 .    in figure",
    "2 the cumulative distribution of neutron star formation times is displayed with solitary neutron stars originating from binaries denoted by the solid line . here , the fraction of neutron stars that have formed before a given time is shown .",
    "neutron star formation begins at @xmath66 myr , and is complete by @xmath67 myr .",
    "the early phase of neutron star formation from very massive stars proceeded through the mass loss associated with the roche lobe overflow episodes ( as described above ) , while the neutron stars with the longest formation times result from the evolution of intermediate mass stars either through electron capture supernovae ( e.g. podsiadlowski et al . 2004 ) or via rejuvenation . for the adopted age of westerlund 1 @xmath68 myr",
    "we find that the fraction of neutron stars formed is @xmath69 , implying that for @xmath70 neutrons formed via disrupted binaries , one would form within the first @xmath71 myr . since _ ( i ) _ most of the massive stars in westerlund 1 appear to reside in binaries and _ ( ii ) _ most of the massive binaries ( @xmath72 ; belczynski , lorimer & ridlay 2008 ) are disrupted in supernovae explosions , one requires at least @xmath70 massive stars ( @xmath73 ) in the westerlund 1 cluster to form one very young pulsar .",
    "one should note the steepness of the cumulative curve for the times close to the age of westerlund 1 , where the fraction changes by more than two orders of magnitude from @xmath74 myr ( @xmath75 ) to @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "there are about @xmath78 stars in westerlund 1 and only stars with masses exceeding @xmath79 have had sufficient time to contract onto the main sequence .",
    "if we adopt a power - law imf with an exponent of @xmath21 , there are about @xmath80 stars more massive than @xmath73 that can potentially form a neutron star .",
    "if these @xmath80 massive stars are required to form the very young pulsar as observed in westerlund 1 it would yield a fractional efficiency of 0.0001 , corresponding to @xmath81 for a cluster age of 4.6 myr .",
    "it should be noted that this approximate estimate is not intended to provide a calibrated rate / efficiency of young pulsar formation , but only to illustrate the an order of magnitude consistency of our results with the particular observation of one object .",
    "the possibility that a primordial single star forms a very young pulsar has also been explored . the calculations were performed with the startrack code for solar metallicity and with standard wind mass loss rates as described in belczynski et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . within the framework of our assumptions regarding the relation between initial and final compact object masses ( belczynski et al .",
    "2008 ) , stars within the mass range of @xmath82 can form neutron stars if the maximum neutron star mass is taken to be @xmath83 .",
    "the minimum formation time of a neutron star is @xmath84 myr for the most massive progenitor ( @xmath85 ) and is longer by nearly a factor of 2 than the time required to produce a pulsar in westerlund 1 .",
    "this is shown in figure  2 where the cumulative distribution of the neutron star formation times for primordial single stars ( dashed line ) is also shown .    adopting a higher maximum neutron star mass of @xmath86 results in a slight decrease of the minimum formation time to @xmath87 myr , corresponding to the final evolution of a @xmath88 star .",
    "this is due to the fact that our predicted initial - final mass relation ( see fig .  1 of belczynski et al .",
    "2008 ) steeply rises with an initial mass above @xmath89 as expected for the increased amount of fall back during compact object formation .    a further decrease in the minimum time for formation of a neutron star",
    "could be accomplished by increasing the metallicity of the stars in westerlund 1 .",
    "for example , given @xmath90 and allowing for a metallicity of @xmath91 as may be expected for a young cluster , the minimum time would decrease further to @xmath92 myr ( @xmath93 ) , but still significantly high for the age of westerlund 1 .",
    "the only remaining alternative ( within the framework of our adopted stellar models ) is to increase the stellar wind mass loss rates . in this case",
    ", the mass loss rates may reduce the stellar mass sufficiently that even initially very massive stars form neutron stars rather than black holes . to examine this possibility ,",
    "we have introduced two scaling factors to multiply our standard wind mass loss rates .",
    "specifically , the factors @xmath94 and @xmath95 are used to scale winds of stars with h - rich envelopes and naked helium stars , respectively . in all the calculations presented herein , @xmath96 .",
    "we follow the hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) scheme and the choice of wind mass loss rates .",
    "in particular , the rates from kudritzki & reimers ( 1978 ) and iben & renzini ( 1993 ) are used for giant branch and further evolution ; vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) are applied to asymptotic giant branch ; nieuwenhuijzen & de jager ( 1990 ) are used for massive stars , but modified for a metallicity dependence ( @xmath97 ) ; hamman & koesterke ( 1998 ) is employed for wolf - rayet - like winds ; humphreys & davidson ( 1994 ) rates are used for luminous blue variables ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ; where @xmath100 are luminosity and radius expressed in solar units ) .    in figure",
    "3 the initial - final mass relation for single star models with various wind mass loss rates for stars with h - rich envelopes : @xmath101 are presented .",
    "we have chosen models with high metallicity ( @xmath102 ) and fixed wind mass loss rates for naked helium stars @xmath103 .",
    "since the increased winds reduce the final compact object mass we note the change in mass of the most massive star that can still form neutron star .",
    "for @xmath104 it is found that only stars with @xmath105 can form neutron stars for @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "it is also found that only stars more massive than @xmath107 can form compact objects within 5 myr .",
    "both constraints can only be satisfied for the model with very high winds : @xmath108 .",
    "therefore if single star is to produce a very young pulsar the stellar winds would need to be increased by factor of @xmath109 or higher .",
    "we find that such a drastic increase is unrealistic as it would prohibit formation of massive black holes over @xmath110 for a high metallicity and over @xmath111 for solar metallicity .",
    "however , a few black holes in galactic x - ray transient sources have dynamical mass estimates exceeding @xmath112 ( e.g. , orosz 2003 ; casares 2006 ) .",
    "in addition , recent observations indicate that stellar black holes can form with even higher masses in low metallicity environments ; @xmath113 black hole in m33 ( orosz et al . 2007 ) and @xmath114 black hole in ic10 ( prestwich et al . 2007 ; see also silverman & filipenko 2008 for an improved orbital estimate ) .",
    "although it is expected that black holes form with higher mass in lower metallicity environments , it was recently demonstrated that a reduction in the wind loss rate was necessary for the formation of such massive black holes ( bulik , belczynski & prestwich 2008 ) .",
    "we have only investigated the increase of winds for stars with h - rich envelopes , as it has been argued that stellar wind mass loss rates for massive helium stars ( i.e. , wolf - rayet stars ) are systematically overestimated due to the `` clumpiness '' of mass outflows from these stars ( e.g. , hamann & koesterke 1998 ; nugis & lamers 2000 ) .",
    "the reduction due to the clumpiness is already included in our study , but a further decrease ( factor of @xmath115 ) was recently suggested by vanbeveren , van bever & belkus ( 2007 ) , thereby , making it more unlikely that enhanced wind loss rates from single stars are responsible for the formation of neutron stars in westerlund 1 .",
    "a population synthesis study of the massive star population for westerlund 1 has been carried out to examine the possible formation history its neutron star member , cxo j164710.2 - 45526 .",
    "the young age of the cluster ( @xmath10 myr ) , corresponding to a star of @xmath29 at the turn off of the main sequence places important constraints on its prior history .",
    "it is found that an isolated neutron star can be formed as a result of the disruption of a binary system during a supernova phase ( within 5 myr ) provided that the initial progenitor system is characterized by primary masses in the range of @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "only stars of mass @xmath116 , for single star models can produce a neutron star within 5 myr , however , the rate of mass loss via stellar winds must be enhanced to the extent that the formation of black holes with masses exceeding @xmath112 becomes problematic .",
    "a major feature in the binary scenario of neutron star formation is the significant mass loss taking place in case a rlof . in this mass transfer phase ,",
    "a much smaller he core ( @xmath117 ) is formed at the end of the main sequence phase as compared to the isolated evolution of the same star ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the removal of the h - rich envelope through the ongoing rlof stage before central he - ignition ( case b ) leads to the onset of strong wolf - rayet type winds , preventing an increase of the he core mass via h shell burning .",
    "although we employ revised ( decreased to account for `` clumpiness '' ) wind mass loss rates for naked helium stars ( e.g. , hamann & koesterke 1998 ) , the wolf - rayet phase leads to a further loss of @xmath119 from the primary star .",
    "this is a secondary , but nevertheless important effect leading to the formation of very young neutron stars .",
    "an additional factor enhancing the formation of neutron stars from very massive binary components was pointed out by brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ; and references within ) , who argued that if the h - rich envelope is removed ( e.g. , in case b or early case c rlof ) and h shell burning is extinguished before the end of central he burning the resulting fe core mass is reduced in comparison to the case where the h - envelope is not removed .",
    "hence , the formation of a low mass compact object ( i.e. , a neutron star rather than a black hole ) could be enhanced .",
    "this finding was connected to the supply ( or lack thereof in the case of the neutron star formation ) of fresh helium into the burning core that can alter the amount of carbon and thus the carbon burning lifetimes in this phase of stellar evolution . since this effect",
    "is not modelled in our simulations , our predictions are more conservative .",
    "in other words , we could expect even more massive stars ( than predicted here ) to form neutron stars under the favorable conditions .",
    "due to ejection of matter and natal kicks during a supernova , it is expected that the neutron star will be displaced from its formation site .",
    "the projected distance of cxo j164710.2 - 455216 from the cluster center is about 2.3 pc ( e.g. , muno et al .",
    "the source could have been formed anywhere in westerlund 1 and been moving since the time of its formation ( @xmath120 ) with velocity ( @xmath121 ) imposed on the neutron star during the supernova explosion .",
    "we note that motion of the system prior to the supernova explosion because of interactions with other stars or binaries in the cluster could also contribute , but the former are expected to be significantly larger . in figure",
    "4 the space velocities of the very young pulsars formed in our simulations under the assumption of a null initial velocity of the binary prior to explosion are shown .",
    "the results are presented for two calculations ; a reference calculation with the hobbs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) natal kick distribution ( @xmath28 km s@xmath8 ) , and one obtained with low kicks ( @xmath122 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "it is found that the average velocities are @xmath123 km s@xmath8 for the reference and low kick models , respectively .",
    "in addition , due to the smaller probability of progenitor binary disruption ( and thus formation of a solitary pulsar ) the number of young solitary pulsars decreases from @xmath124 for the reference model to @xmath125 for the low kick model . using the velocity distribution with the age of each pulsar ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the average distance traveled since its birth is calculated as @xmath126 pc for the reference and low kick models , respectively .",
    "this reveals that the majority of the young pulsars is bound to leave the cluster . for a region characterized by",
    "10 pc ( comparable to the size of westerlund 1 ) an estimate of the probability of finding a pulsar within the cluster yields @xmath127 of pulsars for the reference and low kick models , respectively .",
    "this result may indicate that the predicted fractional efficiency of forming very young pulsars is lower ( by factors of @xmath128 ) than presented in figure  2 .",
    "the decreased efficiency ( even by factor of 10 ) , however , still permits one very young pulsar to be found within the cluster age of 5 myr .",

    "<S> the evolution leading to the formation of a neutron star in the very young westerlund 1 star cluster is investigated . </S>",

    "<S> the brightest x - ray source in the cluster , cxo j164710.2 - 455216 , is a slowly spinning ( @xmath2 s ) single neutron star and potentially a magnetar . </S>",
    "<S> since this source was argued to be a member of the cluster , the neutron star progenitor must have been very massive ( @xmath3 ) as noted by muno et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) . since such massive stars </S>",
    "<S> are generally believed to form black holes ( rather than neutron stars ) , the existence of this object poses a challenge for understanding massive star evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we point out while single star progenitors below @xmath4 form neutron stars , binary evolution completely changes the progenitor mass range . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate that mass loss in roche lobe overflow enables stars as massive as @xmath5 , under favorable conditions , to form neutron stars . if the very high observed binary fraction of massive stars in westerlund 1 ( @xmath6 ) is considered , it is natural that cxo j164710.2 - 455216 was formed in a binary which was disrupted in a supernova explosion such that it is now found as a single neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the existence of a neutron star in a given stellar population does not necessarily place stringent constraints on progenitor mass when binary interactions are considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the existence of a neutron star in westerlund 1 cluster is fully consistent with the generally accepted framework of stellar evolution . </S>"
