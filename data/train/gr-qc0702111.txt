    "@xmath226 the radius @xmath212 reads @xmath227    let s find an upper bound for the function @xmath228 .",

    "the value @xmath237 of this global maximum is approximately @xmath238 ( planck units ) .",
    "collecting all the results together we get the following conclusion .    the bousso entropy bound for lightsheets generated by spheres in a static spherically symmetric spacetime filled with radiation can be violated only in a region @xmath213 , where @xmath212 , given by ( [ rc ] ) , satisfies @xmath239    for @xmath0 of order not larger then @xmath240 , @xmath212 will be of order not larger than unit planck length .",
    "we can not expect that physics used here for description of gas and gravity remains valid on such scales .",
    "so we can say that for @xmath0 small enough the entropy bound @xmath149 is valid on scales where classical physics makes sense .",
    "the sufficient conditions for bousso entropy bound derived by flanagan , marolf and wald ( fmw conditions ) @xcite read @xmath241 for an arbitrary null vector @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the entropy flux and @xmath244 are arbitrary positive constants satisfying @xmath245 . in case of a stationary radiation gas",
    "these inequalities reduce to @xmath246 comparing ( [ fmw ] ) and ( [ sr ] ) and using @xmath247 we see that the second fmw condition in case of a static spherically symmetric spacetime filled with radiation can be written as @xmath248 . following the lines of argumentation by which we showed that the inequality @xmath249 is equivalent to @xmath250 , where @xmath205 is given by ( [ tc ] ) , one can show that the second fmw condition is equivalent to @xmath251 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath252 is an increasing function and @xmath115 , the first fmw condition can be written as @xmath253 .",
    "after a short calculation we get an equivalent expression of this condition : @xmath254 .    denoting @xmath255 the smaller of @xmath256 and @xmath257 , the set of conditions ( [ fmw ] ) is equivalent to @xmath258 since @xmath244 are positive and satisfy @xmath245 , the smallest possible value of @xmath259 is @xmath260 .",
    "so the restriction of temperature imposed by the fmw conditions is at least @xmath261 times more strict then restriction imposed directly by bousso entropy bound for lightsheets generated by spheres .",
    "however , the fmw conditions imply the bousso entropy bound for general lightsheets , not only for that generated by spheres . but even if the fmw conditions would impose stronger restrictions on parameters than the general form of the bousso bound , it would not be surprising , since the fmw conditions are only sufficient and not necessary for the bousso bound . using ( [ tcb ] ) we get a sufficient condition for the general form of the bousso bound @xmath262    the region where the fmw conditions are violated is always larger than the region where the bousso bound for spherical lightsheets does not hold .",
    "this can be seen if we take the second fmw condition in the form @xmath263 and we realize that the highest possible value of @xmath264 is @xmath265 .",
    "the range of @xmath106 where @xmath266 is always wider than the range where @xmath210 .",
    "let us denote @xmath267 the largest value of @xmath106 where the first ( second ) fmw condition is violated and @xmath268 the larger of the quantities @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "there is no simple relation between @xmath212 and @xmath268 like in case of temperature , but we can at least derive an upper bound for @xmath268 . repeating the argumentation",
    "which led to the formula ( [ rc ] ) we obtain @xmath271 where @xmath272 and @xmath273 are certain parameters which are used instead of temperature .",
    "we already know that @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath276 has similar behavior as the function @xmath277 .",
    "it achieves its maximum and then it approaches a nonzero value by damped oscillations .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath276 is approximately @xmath278 .",
    "thus , we obtain the following upper bounds @xmath279 denoting @xmath280 the larger quantity of @xmath281 and @xmath282 , the bound for @xmath268 can be written as @xmath283 .",
    "minimizing @xmath280 by appropriate choice of @xmath284 and @xmath264 we obtain @xmath285 .",
    "thus , the final bound reads @xmath286 it means that for appropriate choice of @xmath244 ( namely for values @xmath287 and @xmath288 ) both of the fmw conditions are satisfied for @xmath289 no matter what are the values of parameters @xmath290 .",
    "it was shown that the entropy @xmath151 contained inside a sphere of radius @xmath106 in a static spherically symmetric spacetime filled with a gas of massless particles can be expressed as @xmath291 , where @xmath153 is the area of the sphere , @xmath53 is the norm of a timelike killing field , dot denotes derivative with respect to the proper radius and @xmath292 are entropy density and pressure in the centre of symmetry .",
    "the bousso entropy bound for lightsheets generated by spheres was investigated and it was shown that a violation of the bound can occur only in a region satisfying @xmath293 , where @xmath0 is number of independent polarization states .",
    "it means that for @xmath0 small enough , the bound is satisfied on scales where classical physics makes sense .",
    "furthermore it was shown that a central temperature of radiation @xmath175 must exceed @xmath294 to get a violation of the bound .",
    "thus for @xmath0 small enough the bound can be protected also by a planck temperature cutoff . if @xmath295 the bousso bound holds for general lightsheets ( not only for that generated by spheres ) as was derived using the fmw conditions .",
