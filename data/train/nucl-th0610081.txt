    "ultimately the validity of this ( approximate ) connection between the pion - electroproduction multipoles and the @xmath12-transition form factors has to be checked in a full theoretical calculation .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the theoretical tools necessary to calculate the @xmath12-matrix element eq.([defff ] ) at low energies . in reactions with small momentum transfer ( typically @xmath23gev@xmath24 ) the nucleon can - due to a separation of scales ( the pion is much lighter than the next heavier hadron ) - clearly be divided into a long - ranging pion cloud and a small nucleon core .",
    "chiral effective field theory in the baryon sector ( chpt , for a classic paper see @xcite ) provides a systematic framework for the calculation of pion cloud dynamics and at the same time also encodes short range physics via local operators of ( theoretically ) undetermined strength .",
    "a formulation of chpt suitable for the calculation of the @xmath12-transition is the `` small scale expansion '' ( sse ) @xcite , which includes explicit @xmath0 degrees of freedom and provides an expansion scheme for the chiral lagrangean .",
    "this framework contains three light ( the momentum transfer @xmath25 , the pion mass @xmath26 and the @xmath0-nucleon mass splitting @xmath0 ) and two heavy ( the nucleon mass @xmath7 and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the pion decay constant ) scales and each ratio of a light to a heavy scale is counted as a small parameter of the same order : @xmath29 .",

    "these parts of the lagrangean form the input ( i.e. vertizes and propagators ) for the leading one loop calculation .",
    "all feynman diagrams of a photon field coupling to the @xmath36 system contributing at order @xmath30 in the sse scheme are shown in figure [ fig : feyn ] .",

    "the strength of these operators is undetermined in the effective field theory approach and will be extracted from phenomenology in the next section .",
    "our analysis @xcite has shown - dependence of @xmath41 resulting from the pion cloud alone is considered to be unphysical .",
    "we expect a form factor to tend to zero for large momentum transfer , which @xmath42 can only fulfill if a radius correction of adequate size is included .",
    "the impact of this radius correction is disproportionally magnified by the translation into the jones - scadron form factor basis and therefore has already to be included in an analysis of these form factors at order @xmath30 . a numerical discussion of this effect is given in the next section .",
    "] , that the local operator which gives the contributions from the nucleon core to the form factor @xmath42 a finite spacial extension ( i.e. a contribution to the radius of this form factor which formally is of higher order ) is underestimated by the strict counting rules and its inclusion extends the @xmath43-range of applicability of the leading one loop calculation significantly .",
    "the dependence of the quantities @xmath14 , emr@xmath44 and cmr@xmath44 on the form factors @xmath45 , @xmath42 and @xmath46 is such , that this radius contribution only has a very small impact in the magnetic dipole form factor ( which is highly dominated by @xmath45 ) , but has decisive influence in the quadrupole moments .",
    "altogether we consider short range contributions to the static limit ( @xmath47 ) of @xmath48 and @xmath41 and the radius of @xmath41 in our calculation which thus contains three free parameters .",

    "+ besides the analysis presented here the authors of reference @xcite also performed an effective field theory calculation of the @xmath12-transition at leading one loop level .",
    "let us briefly point out the differences between both chpt calculations :    1 .",
    "in reference @xcite a different expansion scheme , namely the @xmath49-scheme @xcite has been applied to introduce a hierarchy of terms . in this scheme",
    "not all ratios of a small to a large scale are counted as a small parameter of the same order  as it is done in the @xmath50-counting discussed above  but the small parameters are : @xmath51 .",
    "thus the pion mass @xmath26 is counted to be of the order of the @xmath0-nucleon mass - splitting squared .",
    "the order @xmath52 of the momentum transfer then depends on its typical size in the particular process : if @xmath53 and if @xmath54 . the different counting leads to a different estimate of the relevance ( i.e. inclusion or omission at a certain order ) of the feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath55 to @xmath0 matrix element between the sse and the @xmath49-expansion .",
    "diagram ( b ) of figure [ fig : feyn ] , for instance , provides important structures for our result , while it is neglected in the @xmath49-counting approach at leading one loop level .",
    "2 .   while we performed a non - relativistic expansion of the lagrangean ( i.e. not only considered the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath27 but also the nucleon mass @xmath7 as a large scale ) reference @xcite gives a covariant calculation ( i.e. a resummation of all terms which are suppressed by any power of the nucleon mass at a certain order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale ) .",
    "the results show that the inclusion of all terms which are suppressed by inverse powers of the nucleon mass cancels out important parts of the curvature in the @xmath43-dependence of the resulting form factors .",
    "the same effect has already been observed in the vector current of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the additional string of @xmath56-terms provides enough quark mass dependent structures to qualitatively describe their quark mass dependence up to currently available lattice data @xcite .",
    "each of the two studies includes short range physics in a different manner : in @xcite we took into account the accordant contributions to @xmath39 and @xmath40 arising from the chiral lagrangean and furthermore found short range physics to play an important role in the radius of the @xmath41 form factor .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite deal with three _ structurally different _ free parameters : the coupling constants characterizing the magnetic dipole and the electric- and coulomb quadrupole transitions .",
    "furthermore , they effectively include vector - meson exchange by giving the magnetic dipole coupling a dipole - shape @xmath43-dependence .",

    "+ the three free parameters contained in our calculation are extracted from experimental data for the magnetic dipole form factor @xmath14 at @xmath57gev@xmath24 and the value of emr at the real photon point @xmath58 .",
    "having fixed the low energy constants we arrive at the numerical values given in table [ tab : radii ] , where the real and imaginary parts of the static limit values and the radii defined through @xmath59\\left[1-\\frac{1}{6}r_{i,\\textnormal{re}}^2q^2+ ...",

    "the physical interpretation of this is that the pion cloud strongly shields the characteristic of the nucleon core .",
    "qualitatively the same statement can be made about the form factor basis defined in eq.([defff ] ) .",
    "an analogous effect has e.g. already been observed in the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon @xcite . the situation is somewhat different for the radii : while we find that approximately 22% of the squared radius of @xmath41 originate from short range physics @xcite , the translation into the jones - scadron basis drastically amplifies this contribution to the radii of the quadrupole form factors : ) one can see , that the radii are normalized to the the size of the respective form factors at @xmath58 .",
    "the above statements result from just separating the radii into long- and short range physics and keeping the full values for @xmath61 given in table [ tab : radii ] . ]",

    "( [ sdr1])-([sdr2 ] ) exclusively arise from the local operator contributing to @xmath63 . from this observation",
    "one can see that the @xmath64 basis is clearly preferred for the discussion of chiral signatures in the @xmath12-transition as there are fewer kinematical cancellations between large numbers in this basis . at the order of our calculation",
    "all effects beyond the linear @xmath43-dependence of the form factors and hence the rich structures seen in figures [ gm_err]-[cmr_err ] exclusively originate from pion cloud dynamics .",
    "+ in addition to these results cheft provides us with the knowledge about the structures which can arise in a calculation of the form factors at higher orders .",
    "the additional structures contributing to each form factor at lowest order beyond our calculation read : @xmath65 here only those contributions which can not be absorbed via a reparametrization of the three free parameters of our calculation where considered .",
    "the uncertainties when neglecting the above given structures in the @xmath66 calculation are estimated by varying the coefficients of these structures within their natural size , i.e. between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "a stronger constraint is put on the value of @xmath69 which dominates the error of the magnetic dipole form factor , since we demand the result to be consistent with the input data of our analysis ( i.e. @xmath14 at low @xmath43 ) .",
    "this condition is only fulfilled for @xmath70 .",
    "+ the solid lines in figures [ gm_err ] , [ emr_err ] and [ cmr_err ] represent the outcome of our order @xmath30 sse analysis for @xmath14 , emr@xmath44 and cmr@xmath44 , respectively . the gray shaded band around these curves marks the area in which the array of curves with parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 lies .",
    "this band indicates the uncertainties which arise when neglecting higher order effects .",
    "a further source of errors lies in the values of those low energy constants already present in the @xmath66 calculation , which have been kept fixed in the error analysis presented in figures [ gm_err ] , [ emr_err ] and [ cmr_err ] .",
    "this is the reason for the fact that the shown error bands for @xmath14 and emr@xmath44 shrink to zero for @xmath73 .",
    "as the quality of the determination of the low energy constants depends on the quality of the experimental data used as input , the typical experimental errors of each quantity indicate the possible variation of the chpt result .",
    "the conclusion from the here presented error analysis is , that the calculation at leading one loop order gives a trustworthy prediction of all three transition form factors for momentum transfer @xmath43 smaller than @xmath74gev@xmath24 ( note that neither the @xmath43 dependence of emr nor any information about cmr was used as input for our extraction of the low energy constants ; the given curves for the quadrupole moments are a prediction ) . beyond",
    "@xmath75gev@xmath24 higher order effects can  according to this analysis  play a decisive role . we want to emphasize that due to the uncertainties arising from the extraction of the low energy constants the shown results for the quadrupoles are not in contradiction with most of the models shown in the same figures . e.g. , if we where to use the @xmath58-values for the quadrupole moments from sato and lee @xcite as input for our analysis ( instead of the experimental emr@xmath76 ) , the sse result would exactly agree with this model prediction ( see figure [ cmr_err ] ) . furthermore , we observe that all models ( sato - lee @xcite and dmt @xcite ) and calculations ( our analysis , its predecessor @xcite and the calculation in the @xmath49-scheme @xcite ) containing pion cloud effects coincidingly predict a decreasing emr at low @xmath43 ( where pion cloud effects should be relevant ) .    :",
