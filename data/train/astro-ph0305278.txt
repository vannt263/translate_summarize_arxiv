    "the emissivity of galaxy samples selected at various wavelengths ( uv , optical , radio ) over a range of redshifts is one of the most powerful and widely used evolutionary tests ( e.g. lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; connolly et al .",

    "corrections have also been applied taking into account incompleteness of the 2dfgrs sample due to both poor s / n spectra ( @xmath124 , unclassified objects ) at faint magnitudes and instrumental limitations ( e.g. fiber collisions ) that did not allow a fraction of the target galaxies to be observed .",

    "griffiths & padovani ( 1990 ) converted the @xmath135 luminosity function of iras star - forming galaxies to x - ray wavelengths and argued that star - forming galaxies with mild evolution could produce 20 - 30 per cent of the xrb .",
    "similarly , pearson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used iras star - forming galaxies to fit the x - ray counts at faint flux limits and estimated that such systems could contribute as much as 30 - 50 per cent of the xrb .",
    "the studies above clearly demonstrate that there is significant uncertainty in the xrb fraction produced by star - forming galaxies critically depending on the adopted evolution .",
    "the present study of spiral galaxies to @xmath2 can not on its own be used to either constrain the evolution of these systems with @xmath87 or estimate their _ total _ xrb contribution extrapolated to high @xmath87 . however , comparison of our results at @xmath2 with those obtained at higher redshifts ( e.g. hornschemeier et al .",
    "2002 ) indicate x - ray evolution for these systems .",
    "indeed , the almost constant @xmath8 versus @xmath87 relation in figure [ fig_lxlbz ] can be interpreted as evidence that @xmath114 evolves in at least the same rate as @xmath11 .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to attempt to constrain the x - ray evolution of star - forming galaxies using the x - ray emissivity of 2dfgrs spirals at @xmath2 and assuming that the bulk of the soft xrb that remains unaccounted for in deep x - ray surveys is produced by star - forming processes .",
    "deep rosat surveys ( hasinger at al .",
    "1998 ) to the limit @xmath136 have resolved 68 - 81 per cent of the soft ( @xmath137kev ) xrb into discrete sources .",
    "most of them are agns ( 78 per cent ; schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) with a small fraction being galaxy groups or clusters ( 6 per cent ; lehmann et al . 2001 ) .",
    "more recently , deep _",
    "chandra _ surveys ( e.g. mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ; brandt et al . 2001c ; giacconi et al . 2002 ) extended the study of the x - ray source population to the limits @xmath138 .",
    "for example , mushotzky et al . ( 2000 ) resolved 6 - 13 per cent of the soft band xrb to sources also believed to be agns with fluxes in the range @xmath139 . only a small fraction of the xrb ( 1 - 2 per cent ) is believed to be produced by star - forming galaxies at the flux limits of the ultra - deep _ chandra _ surveys ( hornschemeir et al .",
    "2002a ; alexander et al .",
    "the evidence above suggests that 74 - 96 per cent of the soft band xrb has been resolved and is produced by agns , groups or clusters allowing a maximum of 6 - 26 per cent to star - forming galaxies .",
    "we employ the spiral galaxy @xmath121 at @xmath2 to constrain the maximum allowed evolution for these systems . under the assumption that the x - ray emissivity follows the form @xmath12 to a maximum formation redshift @xmath140 , we find that the index @xmath14 should be @xmath141 and @xmath142 for the xrb fraction produced by these systems to be @xmath143 and @xmath144 per cent respectively .",
    "we note that surveys at optical wavelengths estimate @xmath145 ( e.g. lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we stress that the xrb fraction due to star - forming galaxies quoted above ( and hence , the derived evolution parameter @xmath14 ) is an upper limit . although , a number of studies suggest that as much as 20 - 50 per cent of the xrb could be produced by starbursts ( e.g. griffiths & padovani 1990 ; pearson et al .",
    "1997 ) more recent estimates suggest modest soft band fractions ( e.g. persic & rephaeli 2003 ; ranalli et al .",
    "deep wide field surveys selecting star - forming galaxies at higher redshifts using homogeneous and well defined criteria are required to constrain the x - ray evolution of these systems and hence , their xrb contribution .",
    "this paper provides such a sample at low redshifts for comparison with future studies .",
    "finally , the x - ray emission of spirals not dominated by agn is associated to the star - formation activity of the parent galaxy ( fabbiano & shapley 2002 ; read & ponman 2001 ) .",
    "consequently , the x - ray emission of these systems can be used to probe both the individual and the global star - formation rate ( sfr ) . however , the quantitative link between x - ray luminosity and sfr is rather tenuous , depending on poorly constrained parameters such as the initial mass function and the nature of the stellar sources responsible for the x - ray emission ( e.g. ghosh & white 2001 ) .",
    "more theoretical and observational work is clearly needed in this field . here",
    ", we adopt the empirical 0.5 - 2kev x - ray luminosity to sfr conversion derived by ranalli et al .",
    "for the x - ray luminosity of the spirals in the present sample we find a mean sfr of @xmath146 while the star - formation density of the present sample at @xmath2 is @xmath147 .",
    "this is lower than previous estimates using galaxy samples selected at different wavelengths .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties involved in converting x - ray luminosity to star - formation rate the agreement is surprising .",
    "this suggests that deep x - ray surveys detecting an increasing number of ` normal ' galaxies can be used as probes of the sfr of individual systems .",
    "in this paper we study the mean x - ray properties of ` normal ' galaxies using stacking analysis techniques .",
    "we use a shallow ( 2 - 10ksec ) xmm-_newton _ survey covering an area of @xmath0 and overlapping with the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "the 2dfgrs sample has the advantage of high quality spectra and hence , accurate redshifts and reliable classifications into early - type and late - type galaxies .    in the stacking analysis we use a sample of @xmath148 2dfgrs galaxies with a mean redshift of @xmath2 . in the soft 0.5 - 2kev band",
    "we detect a statistically significant signal for both the whole sample ( @xmath3 ) and the early ( @xmath149 ) and late ( @xmath150 ) type galaxy sub - samples . on the contrary",
    ", no signal is detected for any of the above samples in the hard 2 - 8kev band .",
    "the main conclusions from this study are summarised below :    * we find that the mean @xmath8 ratio of the present sample at @xmath2 is consistent within the errors with both local ( @xmath9mpc ) and distant ( @xmath10 ) samples after accounting for differences in the mean @xmath11 of the samples .",
    "this suggests little or no evolution of the x - ray emission mechanisms relative to the optical at least to @xmath10 . * the mean x - ray emissivity , @xmath121 , of ` normal ' galaxies at @xmath2",
    "is found to be consistent with that of local hii samples .",
    "we also find that the present sample of 2dfgrs spirals contributes about 0.4 per cent to the soft band xrb .",
    "this low fraction is in broad agreement with previous studies estimating the xrb produced by star - forming spirals at moderate redshifts . * for star - forming galaxies assuming an x - ray luminosity evolution of the form",
    "@xmath12 to a maximum redshift @xmath151 we find @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 values are constrained by the relatively low fraction of the soft x - ray background that remains unresolved by deep surveys ( 626% ) .",
    "higher @xmath14 values will result in an overproduction of the soft x - ray background given the fraction already attributed to agn , groups and clusters . * using the mean x - ray properties of the spiral galaxy sub - sample and assuming an empirical x - ray luminosity to sfr conversion factor we estimate a global sfr density of @xmath152 at @xmath2 .",
