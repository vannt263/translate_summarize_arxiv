    "the characterization of entanglement in quantum many - body systems has become increasingly important over the last few years .",
    "it has been at the heart of a fruitful interdisciplinary work , with strong motivations coming both from quantum information @xcite and from `` conventional '' condensed matter theory .",
    "these include topics as diverse as the investigation of computational complexity of algorithms such as dmrg @xcite , or the development of new numerical tools such as peps @xcite or mera @xcite  which aim to give access to far larger system sizes than exact diagonalisation techniques , or the hunt for theoretical tools able to grasp some of the features of topologically ordered phases of matter @xcite .    among all the competing quantities that have been proposed as ( theoretical ) measures of quantum entanglement , the von neumann entanglement entropy ( ee ) is the most widely accepted@xcite .",
    "it is defined through a bipartition of the hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "most of the time , the bipartition corresponds to a spatial cut of the system , the subsystem @xmath0 being thought of as the physical system of interest , and @xmath1 as the `` environment '' .",
    "usually , one starts with a pure state @xmath6 , then defines its reduced density matrix @xmath7 , and its ee as the von neumann entropy of @xmath8 @xmath9 intuitively , the more entangled the system is , the less separable it is , and therefore the larger the ee is . while the ee has been computed numerically or analytically in a large variety of systems , its experimental measure would generically require the knowledge of a prohibitively large number of correlation functions , which can be traced back to the intrinsic non - locality of this quantity .",
    "however , some methods have been proposed for direct measures in free fermion systems@xcite ( see also the discussion in @xcite about interacting systems ) , or for an original experimental implementation of the replica trick which could possibly lead to a measure@xcite of the rnyi entropies @xmath10 .",
    "in @xcite we introduced a quantity which has a behaviour that is similar to the ee , the ( logarithmic ) bipartite fidelity ( lbf ) .",
    "the lbf is in principle simpler to measure than the ee , because it is defined as an overlap of two states ( see below ) .",
    "the common feature of the `` experimental '' methods that have been proposed to measure both the ee and the lbf is that they rely on probing some of the non - equilibrium properties of the system .",
    "more specifically , the relation between entanglement and time - evolution of quantum systems after a sudden change of parameters in the hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e. _ after a _ quantum quench _ , has been emphasized . in that sense ,",
    "the methods proposed for a measure of the rnyi entropy @xcite and for the lbf @xcite are the same , and rely on the probability of observing the system in the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath11 after a sudden local quench @xmath12 .",
    "an experimental device would be considerably more involved in the case of the rnyi entropies @xcite than for the lbf though .",
    "the theoretical study of quantum quenches has been very active @xcite ( the list is far from exhaustive ) , in part triggered by the recent experimental achievements in ultracold atoms @xcite , which now allow to build atomic systems without dissipation , and with large ranges of tunable parameters .",
    "another fascinating question is the one of thermalisation in quantum systems after quenches @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting aspect of some of the results on entanglement and quantum quenches is their universality @xcite .",
    "various scaling laws , critical exponents and universal functions have been discovered . in the case of one - dimensional systems , in particular ,",
    "it is well - known that , at quantum criticality , the low - energy excitations are generically described by a conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the cft formalism has been successfully applied to derive a variety of results in that context ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we fill some of the gaps that still appear in this already large literature .",
    "indeed , to our knowledge , the question of finite - size systems and quantum recursion at criticality has not been addressed in general ( see , however , @xcite for partial results ) .",
    "neither has been studied the lbf after a local quench in such systems , apart from @xcite .",
    "therefore we focus on local quantum quenches in finite - size systems , which we study by cft methods , extending the results of the pioneering papers by calabrese and cardy @xcite and eisler and peschel @xcite and providing numerical checks of our results in free fermion systems .",
    "we study both the ee and the lbf , emphasizing the differences between the behaviours of these two quantities .",
    "we find that there are striking light - cone effects , both for the ee and for the lbf .",
    "since for a system evolving in time the lbf is nothing but ( minus the logarithm of ) the _ loschmidt echo _ @xmath13 as noted in @xcite , in the rest of this paper we will prefer the latter terminology , as it is more often used in the context of quantum quenches . we will therefore call _ logarithmic loschmidt echo _ ( lle ) the quantity @xmath14 , keeping in mind that it is the same as the lbf defined in @xcite evolving with time @xmath15 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : finite_size ] we first describe some basic consequences of a local quantum quench in a one - dimensional critical system . in particular , we explain why the time evolution of the wave function after the quench should be periodic . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cft ] we derive several results for the time - evolution of the entanglement entropy as well as the loschmidt echo .",
    "this section relies mainly on cft methods , and may be skipped at first reading .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : plateaus ] focuses on the results , providing physical interpretations and numerical checks of these in free fermion systems .",
    "in this paper we consider 1 + 1-dimensional systems which are described by a cft at sufficiently large distances and time scales ( see for example @xcite for an introduction to cft ) .",
    "we are interested mainly in finite - size systems .",
    "typically , such a system can be a gapless spin chain of finite size @xmath16 , for sufficiently large @xmath16 . for a system with open boundary conditions , which are assumed to correspond to a single conformal boundary condition throughout the paper ,",
    "the lower - energy part of the spectrum of the gapless hamiltonian @xmath17 is given by @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 is the ( bulk ) extensive part of the energy , and @xmath20 the boundary energy .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath20 are both non - universal .",
    "@xmath22 is the fermi velocity , @xmath23 is the ( universal ) central charge of the cft and the @xmath24 are the conformal dimensions of the operators @xmath25 appearing in the low - energy part of the spectrum .",
    "there are two kinds of such operators , the _ primary fields _ and their _",
    "descendants_. the descendants can always be constructed out of a single primary field , and correspond to some combinations of its derivatives .",
    "the primary fields can not in general be expressed as descendants of other fields . the primary fields that appear in the spectrum ( [ eq : finitesizec ] ) depend both on the cft and on the boundary condition we are dealing with .",
    "typically , in unitary cfts that are of interest for condensed matter applications ( for example as scaling limits of spin chains ) , there is a discrete ( often finite ) set of primary fields . if a primary field is present in the spectrum ( [ eq : finitesizec ] ) , then all its descendants must appear as well .",
    "the conformal dimensions of a descendant @xmath26 and of the primary field @xmath27 are _ always separated by an integer_. this property is crucial when we deal with time evolution . indeed ,",
    "if the system is initially in the state @xmath28 , then @xmath29 , and in particular after time @xmath30 all the descendants of a primary field @xmath25 pick up the same phase , up to additive @xmath31 corrections .    .",
    "after time @xmath32 , the particles come back at the same position .",
    "therefore , up to possible phase factors due to the reflection against the boundaries , the system is periodic . ]",
    "[ [ section ] ]    this can be interpreted intuitively with the following semi - classical picture ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : particles ] ) .",
    "low - energy excitations can be seen as some `` quasi - particles '' moving at fixed speed @xmath22 . there can be different species @xmath33 of quasi - particles in the system , which correspond to the different _ primary _ fields @xmath27 in the cft .",
    "the behaviour of these different species of quasi - particles differs at the boundary : they pick up a phase factor @xmath34 .",
    "this `` quasi - particle '' picture is heuristic and is useful to predict light - cone behaviours , as explained below , however it fails to give quantitative predictions in general .    [ [ section-1 ] ]    it is important at this stage to emphasize that the commensurability of the spectrum ( more precisely of each subsector of the spectrum corresponding to each primary field @xmath27 and its descendants ) can only occur in the scaling limit .",
    "it is not true in a finite system , because of the order @xmath35 corrections in ( [ eq : finitesizec ] ) .",
    "the crucial requirement is that the dispersion relation must be linear @xmath36 ( if @xmath37 is the momentum in a translation - invariant system ) . in our numerical checks",
    "we will focus on finite - size lattice systems , and although the dispersion relation can be linearised close to the fermi energy , there are subleading terms which spoil the commensurability of the spectrum ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this point ) .",
    "however , as we shall see , the periodic behaviour will be a very good approximation in the case of the local quenches we are interested in : see already fig .  [",
    "fig : oscillations ] for a first example .",
    "there are two reasons why this is the case .",
    "* we look at the behaviour of the system at sufficiently large distance and time scales ( typically large compared to the lattice spacing @xmath33 ) , such that the continuum description is relevant .",
    "however , we restrict our analysis to times @xmath38 , such that the order @xmath35 terms in ( [ eq : finitesizec ] ) are still small . for larger times , these terms spoil the periodicity .",
    "typically , for systems with a number of sites of order @xmath39 , we expect to see about @xmath40 oscillations that are well described by the cft calculations , and after that the non - universal corrections become too large .",
    "* we are interested in local quenches only .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath41 is changed only locally .",
    "this is radically different from a _",
    "quench , where parameters of the hamiltonian would be changed suddenly everywhere in the system .",
    "after a local quench , there are much less excitations in the system than after a global one . in particular , for a local quench ,",
    "we expect only the lower energy part of the spectrum to be significantly excited .",
    "for these excitations the formula ( [ eq : finitesizec ] ) applies . for _ global",
    "_ quenches however , we would expect also high - energy excitations with non - universal scaling behaviour .",
    "lattice effects would be presumably much more important in that case , and would spoil the commensurability of ( the different sectors of ) the spectrum almost immediately , leading to chaotic or turbulent behaviour , as observed in @xcite .     after a local quench in the middle of a system of size @xmath42 .",
    "a couple of oscillations of the finite - size system can be observed after the local quench .",
    "they are very well described by the cft ( slightly anticipating on eq .",
    "[ eq : le_sym ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : s_sym ] ) .",
    "the rapid oscillations appearing in the plots are analogous to the one observed at equilibrium ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "their amplitude decreases for bigger and bigger system sizes , and we will not discuss them in this paper .",
    "after longer times , the non - universal @xmath35 terms in ( [ eq : finitesizec ] ) spoil the cft oscillations , and the periodic behaviour is lost.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   after a local quench in the middle of a system of size @xmath42 . a couple of oscillations of the finite - size system can be observed after the local quench .",

    "we now specify the type of local quenches we are interested in , and we show how these can be studied using cft techniques , following previous works @xcite .    , then at time @xmath43 it evolves with the total hamiltonian @xmath44 . ]      in this paper we study one type of local quench only .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional system of length @xmath16 , with open boundary conditions .",
    "we cut the system into two parts @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of length @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "the system is initially prepared in the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath47 , which is of course the tensor product @xmath48 of the ground state @xmath49 of @xmath50 and the ground state @xmath51 of @xmath52 . for later convenience",
    "we note @xmath53 . at time @xmath2 , the interaction @xmath54 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is switched on instantaneously .",
    "the system then evolves with the total hamiltonian @xmath55 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : quenchline ] ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we consider situations when the boundary condition ( b.c ) is always the same .",
    "namely , if we are dealing with a spin chain of size @xmath16 with free b.c , then the boundary conditions at the cut between @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also free .",
    "moreover , we assume that this is a conformal b.c .",
    "this is always true at least in the scaling limit , since every b.c should renormalize towards a conformal b.c under the renormalization group ( rg ) flow . in this paper",
    "we address neither the question of different b.c , which would involve boundary condition changing operators , nor the one of boundary rg flows .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    there is an important consequence to these assumptions . in general , the initial state @xmath56 should be decomposed as @xmath57 where the index @xmath33 runs over the different primary fields in the spectrum of the cft , and @xmath37 runs over the descendants of each primary field .",
    "this , in principle , gives the time - evolution after the quench , since by definition the @xmath58 are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath59 , with eigenvalues ( [ eq : finitesizec ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the coefficients @xmath60 is difficult though .",
    "_ for the particular type of quench we are looking at , however , only the identity and its descendants have non - zero overlaps _ @xmath61 .",
    "_ this huge simplification occurs because we assume that the conformal b.c .",
    "is the same everywhere .",
    "_ since the initial state @xmath62 is built out of the ground states of @xmath50 and @xmath52 , which are both hamiltonians with the same b.c .",
    "on the left and right boundary , @xmath49 and @xmath51 both correspond to the identity operator .",
    "then the fusion of these two states has to be the identity as well .",
    "this , composed with some conformal transformation of the space - time geometry ( as will become clear below ) can not generate any operator but the identity and its descendants .",
    "since only the sector of the identity appears in the spectrum , the evolution of the system should be truly periodic ( up to the order @xmath35 corrections discussed in the previous section ) .",
    "there is no additional phase corresponding to different primary operators which could presumably affect the periodicity anymore . in the `` quasi - particle '' picture",
    "this means that there is only one species of quasi - particles which can be emitted by the local quenches we are considering .",
    "let us stress again the fact that this conclusion would not hold if we were considering different b.c . in the system .",
    "changing the b.c .",
    ", for example on both sides of the quench , would generate other species of quasi - particles .      as a warm - up exercise ,",
    "let us consider the simpler case of two semi - infinite systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are glued together at time @xmath2 .",
    "this of course corresponds to the limiting case @xmath63 in the above setting ( fig .",
    "[ fig : quenchline ] ) .",
    "we review the cft calculation of the loschmidt echo @xcite and of the entanglement entropy @xcite in that case .      .",
    "it can be obtained by a conformal mapping from the upper half - plane @xmath64 . notice that the imaginary time flows in the left - right direction .",
    "the distance between the two slits is @xmath65 .",
    "the infinitesimal transformation @xmath66 is applied at the right of @xmath67 in the @xmath68 region .",
    "@xmath69 is the image of @xmath67 through the inverse conformal mapping : @xmath70 . ]",
    "the cft calculation is performed in imaginary time @xmath65 .",
    "for the loschmidt echo we need to compute @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the hamiltonian of the total system .",
    "this can be done using the relation @xmath73 which is valid for any state @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 is the ground state energy of @xmath77 .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : loschmidt ] ) becomes ( for @xmath78 ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "this is the partition function of a statistical mechanical system defined in the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corners ] .",
    "the normalization constant in ( [ eq : loschmidtz ] ) will be fixed later .",
    "there is an extensive part in the free energy @xmath81 coming from the region of size @xmath65 between the two corners in fig .",
    "[ fig : corners ] .",
    "this part will contribute only to a phase factor when we come back to real time ( @xmath82 ) , which disappears in the norm ( [ eq : loschmidt ] ) .",

    "we can absorb this contribution in the normalization constant however , which will be fixed later when we come back in real time .",

    "in this paper , we study the time evolution of a one - dimensional quantum critical system after a local quench .",
    "this `` _ cut and glue _ '' quench is particular , in the sense that it corresponds to a single conformal boundary condition in the scaling limit .",
    "this is clearly restrictive , and the problem of quenches corresponding to different conformal boundary conditions ( and more generically to the possible rg flows between those ) deserves some further investigation .",
    "for such a quench , we have argued that the evolution of the system is periodic , with period @xmath32 if @xmath16 is the size of the system and @xmath22 is the fermi velocity .",
    "this is true only in the continuum limit , but we observe that it is a very good approximation for large finite - size systems , which typically exhibit a number oscillations just after the quench . for very long times",
    "however ( @xmath362 ) , the finite - size effects spoil the periodicity of the system and the cft description is not accurate anymore .    the restriction to this particular type of quench",
    "also allows us to get simple universal results which complete the ones obtained over the last years by calabrese and cardy @xcite and eisler and peschel @xcite .",
    "moreover , we aimed to give some further evidence that quantities defined as simple _ overlaps _ can mimic the behaviour of the ee @xcite .",
    "our motivation comes partly from the fact that such overlaps should be , in principle , much easier to measure in real experiments than the ee or rnyi entropies .",
    "indeed , such overlaps are nothing but the _ probability _ of observing the system in its ground state after a quench @xmath12 .",
    "although cardy @xcite recently proposed a type of local quench that would lead to the measure of the rnyi entropies , it seems to us that the `` cut and glue '' quench is still more likely to lead to a realistic implementation . in this paper",
    "we thus focus on overlaps , and more precisely on the ( logarithmic ) loschmidt echo ( which is a time - dependent version of the lbf introduced in @xcite ) , and compare its behaviour with the one of the ee . from a cft perspective",
    ", both quantities can be computed through analytic continuation @xmath363 , where @xmath116 is an uv cutoff . however , for general geometries",
    ", it is not possible to perform this analytic continuation to compute the ee ( because of the absence of an analytic expression for the one - point function in generic cases ) . on the contrary",
    ", we find that for the lle , a semi - analytic treatment involving a numerical solution gives very accurate results .",
    "we provide numerical checks of our analytic calculations in free fermion systems .",
    "we observe light - cone effects , both for the ee and for the lle .",
    "these effects , however , are not quite the same for the two quantities . for a `` cut and glue '' quench @xmath364 ( @xmath365 ) , within the first oscillation of the system @xmath366 , one can distinguish two regions .",
    "the `` cft region '' corresponds to @xmath367 or @xmath368 , where we observe that both the ee and the lle are very well approximated by the cft calculation .",
    "then the `` decay region '' or `` plateau region '' ( @xmath291 ) , where the discrepancy between the behaviour of the ee and the lle is more important .",
    "the ee decays slowly , as observed first by eisler and peschel @xcite in a semi - infinite system , who interpreted this decay as an effect due to slow particles .",
    "the lle does not exhibit such a decay , but rather stays almost constant , leading to pictures with flat plateaus . for large systems",
    "these plateaus are very well approximated by the cft result , which predicts a behaviour that is symmetric under @xmath369 .",
    "the ee is more sensitive to non - universal effects than the lle for this `` cut and glue '' quench .",
    "we observe , however , that the loschmidt echo depends on the filling fraction of the fermion systems which we investigate in the @xmath230 case .",
    "the cft results we have obtained in this paper for the lle turn out to be correct only at half - filling , and these must be modified for other filling fractions , as discussed in section [ sec : filling ] ( the same phenomenon appeared already for the lbf ) .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to have checks of all the cft results which have accumulated over the past years coming from other fields and using different techniques such as integrable systems @xcite or numerical calculations in interacting systems .",
    "another important direction is to study how these cft results can be related to more general types of quenches , where the parameters in the hamiltonian are not turned on / off instantaneously , but rather continuously on a short time scale .",
    "it is known that the behaviour of the system can be affected in different ways at short time ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "cft techniques lead to results that are valid only on longer time scales . how to relate these different regimes is an interesting open question . more generally , it is not clear to us what are the most relevant physical aspects which are missed in these cft models , and how one could make the latter more realistic .",
    "this seems to be of crucial importance if one believes that such results are to be compared with the ones of an actual experiment .",
    "we wish to thank jesper jacobsen for early collaboration on this topic .",
    "we also thank roberto bondesan , grgoire misguich , hubert saleur and francis song for several insightful discussions .",
    "we thank pasquale calabrese and vincent pasquier for very useful suggestions , for reading carefully this paper , and for their constant encouragements to publish these results .",
    "jd acknowledges support from yale university through a yale postdoctoral prize fellowship .",
    "the general method to compute of the ee is known since peschel  @xcite . for the type of local quenches",
    "we are interested in , we refer to refs.@xcite , where the procedure is explained in details . calculating",
    "the ee usually amounts to diagonalizing a @xmath370 matrix .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    we give here some details about the numerical computation of the loschmidt echo in free fermionic systems .",
    "we consider the @xmath371 chain in transverse field @xmath372 a jordan - wigner transformation @xmath373 then allows to express the hamiltonian as a quadratic form in the fermionic operators @xmath374   -\\frac{h}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^l \\left(2c_j^\\dag c_j-1 \\right)\\ ] ] which can be diagonalized using a bogoliubov transformation : @xmath375 the hamiltonian is then rewritten as @xmath376 where we can choose all the one - particle eigenenergies to be positive @xmath377 .",

    "this correlator may be reduced to a pfaffian using wick s theorem . using the relation @xmath395 , @xmath396 where @xmath397 is antisymmetric , while @xmath398 is symmetric .",
    "the matrix elements are given by @xmath399 in the determinant , adding the second column to the first and then the first row to the second we find @xmath400      the bipartite fidelity@xcite is the ( squared ) overlap @xmath401 , and is a direct by - product of the preceding calculation .",
