    "a spacelike zoll surface is a lorentzian surface all of whose spacelike geodesics are simply closed and have the same length .",
    "the basic example of a spacelike zoll surface is de sitter space , the homogeneous space @xmath0 , and its finite coverings since it is not simply connected .",
    "it can be understood as the lorentzian analogue of the round sphere as it has constant positive curvature . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that a spacelike zoll surface is diffeomorphic to a cylinder or a mbius strip .",
    "this purely topological classification leaves open the finer questions of a classification up to isometry or conformality . recall that the cylinder as well as the mbius strip admit uncountable many non equivalent conformal lorentzian structures .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold .",
    "first it provides three infinite dimensional families of examples of spacelike zoll surfaces , in order to test answers to the questions that arise in the study of these surfaces .",
    "second it tries to initiate a study of the conformal properties of spacelike zoll surfaces since this is the main difference , besides the topological one , to the riemannian case .    in the riemannian case",
    "several explicit families of zoll surfaces , i.e.  surfaces all of whose geodesics are simply closed , are known .",
    "the most famous family is certainly the zoll spheres of revolution , i.e.  with a killing vector field , classified by zoll and darboux ( see @xcite chap .  4 ) .",
    "the first work in this direction for spacelike zoll surfaces has been done by boucetta @xcite , who provided examples of spacelike zoll cylinders of revolution , i.e.  admitting a periodic spacelike killing field . however , contrary to a riemannian 2-sphere , killing fields of lorentzian cylinders are not periodic in general .",
    "already , on de sitter space , there exist three conjugacy classes of killing fields : the elliptic , the parabolic and the hyperbolic one , each corresponding to a conjugacy class of @xmath1-dimensional subgroups of @xmath2 acting on @xmath0 .",
    "we have thus decided to investigate spacelike zoll surfaces admitting a non trivial killing field .    for general spacelike zoll cylinders the dynamics and the causal character of a killing vector field coincides with that of a killing vector field on de sitter space ( see proposition [ prop_atlases ] ) .",
    "thus there exist only three types : elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic . adding technical assumptions allows to obtain three families of spacelike zoll metrics , called elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic according to the dynamic of the killing field , see theorems [ theo_parabolic ] , [ theo_elliptic ] and [ theo_hyperbolic ] .",
    "these metrics are constructed as deformations of a covering of de sitter space , the deformation preserving a chosen killing field @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to the construction of zoll surfaces of revolution in chapter 4 of @xcite . in the case of an elliptic killing vector field",
    "the family gives a complete classification .",
    "when @xmath3 has lightlike orbits , the deformations are realized via atlases adapted to @xmath3 ( see definitions [ def_para ] , [ def_hyp ] ) .",
    "these atlases are inspired by ideas used in @xcite . at the moment",
    "the authors are not aware of an example of a spacelike zoll surface with a killing vector field that does not belong to one of these families , but conjecture that such metrics exist .",
    "besides the classification problem for zoll metrics there is the rigidity problem for zoll projective planes proven by green @xcite and recently extended by pries @xcite to surfaces all of whose geodesics are closed .",
    "these notes present a new feature of spacelike zoll surfaces , opposing the riemannian case with the existence of non constant curvature metrics on the mbius strip all of whose spacelike geodesics are closed .",
    "the examples constructed are covered by smooth spacelike zoll metrics with non constant curvature and parabolic or hyperbolic killing vector fields invariant by antipody , see corollaries [ coro_parabolic ] and [ coro_mob_hyp ] .",
    "so far it is not clear whether these metrics are spacelike zoll on the mbius strip .",
    "it is interesting however to note that none of the three families contain real - analytic metrics invariant by antipody .",
    "dropping the assumption of a killing vector field two major results on riemannian zoll surfaces remain : one is the theorem by green @xcite and its recent extension in @xcite mentioned before .",
    "the other one is the theorem of guillemin @xcite saying that the space of zoll metrics on @xmath4 in the conformal class of the constant curvature metric @xmath5 is a manifold near @xmath5 and the tangent space at @xmath5 is precisely the space of odd functions on @xmath4 . if guillemin confined his study to the conformal deformations of the round sphere it is because of the uniformization theorem .",
    "note that an uniformization theorem does not exist for lorentzain surfaces and there exists an infinite number of non isometric conformal classes of lorentzian cylinders .",
    "so naturally the question appears which conformal classes of lorentzian cylinders are represented by spacelike zoll metrics .",
    "this paper contains essentially three results on the conformal class of a spacelike zoll cylinder @xmath6 . without further assumption",
    ", it is shown that a two - fold cover of @xmath6 conformally embeds into de sitter , see proposition [ p3 ] .",
    "in the presence of a killing field theorem [ thm_conf_killing ] shows that @xmath6 is always @xmath7-conformal to a cover of de sitter space , i.e.  that there exists a homeomorphism exchanging the lightlike foliations .",
    "the @xmath7-conformal class is determined by looking at the reflexion of lightlike curves on the conformal boundary .",
    "finally , the first family of example , the parabolic one contains metrics that are not smoothly conformal ( actually not @xmath8-conformal ) to a cover of de sitter space , see theorem [ theo_nonsmoothconformal ] . as often in lorentzian geometry , the question of determining the conformal classes is quite subtle .",
    "the conformal class being simply given by a pair of foliations two metrics may be @xmath9 but not @xmath10-conformal for any @xmath11 .",
    "the authors conjecture that there exist spacelike zoll metrics with a killing field which are not @xmath12-conformal to a cover of de sitter",
    ". an extended classification of parabolic spacelike zoll cylinders could yield such a result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec_zoll ] studies spacelike zoll surface without assuming the presence of a killing field ; section [ section_general ] gives the description of spacelike zoll cylinders admitting a killing field ; section [ sec_conf ] determines the @xmath7-conformal class of these metrics ; sections [ section_parabolic ] , [ section_elliptic ] and [ section_hyperbolic ] are devoted to the construction of the families of examples , finally section [ sec_blaschke ] , following an idea of blaschke , explains how it is possible to blend the preceding constructions in order to find examples that do not admit any killing fields .",

    "so w.lo.g . we can assume that the lift of @xmath21 lies on one side of @xmath25 the lift of @xmath22 .",
    "now consider the strip bounded by @xmath25 and its translate by the deck transformation @xmath26 induced by the fundamental class of @xmath21 . if @xmath27 does not lie in the same connected component of @xmath28 as @xmath29 , then @xmath30 and @xmath31 lie in the strip bounded by @xmath25 and @xmath32 .",
    "but then @xmath26 will have a fixed point in that strip , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath26 is a deck transformation .",
    "consequently @xmath6 is space - orientable .",
    "together with the orientability of @xmath16 this implies the time - orientability of @xmath6 as well .",

    "we can assume that @xmath6 is spacelike zoll .",
    "it is well known that global hyperbolicity is passed down to finite quotients .",
    "let @xmath21 be any spacelike geodesic of @xmath6 . by assumption @xmath21",

    "since @xmath33 is causal the spacelike geodesic with direction @xmath35 is transversal to @xmath33 ( w.l.o.g . we can assume @xmath33 to be smooth . ) .",
    "this induces a smooth family of closed curves transversal to a given curve at one end and disjoint at the other end .",
    "this is of course impossible . therefore @xmath33 intersects @xmath21 and @xmath21 is a cauchy hypersurface .",
    "next we show that the universal cover @xmath36 of @xmath13 is not globally hyperbolic .",

    "we can assume that @xmath40 , relative to the time - orientable metric @xmath41 .",
    "else consider @xmath42 instead of @xmath37 . now",
    "if @xmath43 is globally hyperbolic then the space of causal arcs between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is compact . by the limit curve lemma and the assumption that every future pointing @xmath46-timelike geodesic from @xmath44 intersects @xmath45 we can conclude that both lightlike geodesics emanating from @xmath44 intersect @xmath45 .",
    "since they are curves belonging to different transversal foliations this is impossible .",
    "[ p2 ] let @xmath6 be a lorentzian cylinder all of whose spacelike geodesics are closed .",
    "then any pair of spacelike geodesics intersects at least twice .",
    "the number of intersections is even and constant throughout the set of spacelike geodesics .",
    "the second assertion follows from the first , since obviously there are intersecting spacelike geodesics and any pair of loops in the cylinder has to intersect at least twice if they intersect once .",
    "since @xmath6 is spacelike zoll we can assume with @xcite that the geodesic flow on @xmath47 is a free @xmath48-action .",
    "fix a unit speed simply closed spacelike geodesic @xmath21 and consider the tangent curve @xmath34 .",
    "further let @xmath49 be two unit speed simply closed spacelike geodesics geometrically different from @xmath21",

    "the geodesics with initial direction @xmath56 form a ( smooth ) homotopy by spacelike geodesics geometrically different from @xmath21 with endpoints @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "since any intersection between geometrically different geodesics is transversal , the number of intersection between @xmath21 and @xmath57 has to coincide with the number of intersection between @xmath21 and @xmath58 .",
    "every globally hyperbolic @xmath59-dimensional cylinder is globally conformally flat .",
    "this fact is actually well known .",
    "for the sake of completeness we give a proof .",
    "note that the lemma shows that every globally hyperbolic cylinder is conformal to one connected component of the complement of at most two simply connected and disjoint non timelike curves .",
    "conversely of course every such component is globally hyperbolic .",

    "define two maps @xmath62 to be identical to @xmath63 on @xmath21 , @xmath26 to be constant on the leafs of @xmath64 and @xmath65 to be constant on the leafs of @xmath66 .",
    "since the lightlike foliations are transversal the differentials of @xmath26 and @xmath65 are linearly independent at every point .",
    "lifting everything to the universal cover gives two coordinates @xmath67 whose level sets are lightlike .",
    "therefore the metric in these coordinates reads @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "consequently @xmath70 descends to the quotient and the metric @xmath71 is flat .",
    "next we want to fix a conformal embedding of de sitter space into @xmath72 .",
    "desitter space is isometric to @xmath73 .",
    "so in order to construct a conformal embedding into the flat cylinder we have to find a reparameterization @xmath74 such that @xmath75 is diagonal .",
    "this is equivalent to solving the ode @xmath76 . since @xmath77 is supposed to be a diffeomorphism we can assume that @xmath78",
    ". therefore we have to solve the equation @xmath79 .",
    "in fact we do not need the solution @xmath77 explicitly .",
    "all we require is the value @xmath80 , i.e.  the length of the domain of @xmath77 .",
    "this can be done by integration : we know that @xmath81 for all @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath83 we then see that ( wlog @xmath84 ) @xmath85 the left hand side is equal to @xmath86 ( which give the solution @xmath87 ) and therefore tends to @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "thus de sitter space is conformal to a flat cylinder with circumference @xmath90 and height @xmath88 .",

    "since @xmath6 is spacelike zoll the fundamental class of every spacelike geodesic generates @xmath101 and via the conformal embedding their images generate @xmath102 . note that due to the continuity of the geodesic flow for every pair of neighborhoods of @xmath97 and @xmath98 there exist spacelike geodesics passing through @xmath96 and intersecting these neighborhoods .",
    "the geodesics have to close up after one round .",
    "since the circumference of the circle is @xmath90 , the value of @xmath103 is bounded from above by @xmath90 , i.e.  @xmath104 .",

    "since @xmath6 is globally hyperbolic the boundary of @xmath108 is achronal ( see e.g. @xcite theorem 3.29 and 4.16 ) .",

    "since for the chosen conformal embedding of de sitter we have @xmath136 , the claim follows .",
