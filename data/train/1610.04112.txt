    "dynamical dark matter ( ddm )  @xcite is an alternative framework for dark - matter physics in which dark - matter stability is not required .",
    "instead , the dark sector within the ddm framework comprises a vast ensemble of individual constituent particles exhibiting a variety of different masses , lifetimes , and cosmological abundances .",
    "the phenomenological viability of such a dark sector is then ensured through a non - trivial _ balancing _ between cosmological abundances and standard - model ( sm ) decay widths across the ensemble . indeed , under this balancing , those ensemble constituents with shorter lifetimes must have smaller cosmological abundances , while states with longer lifetimes may have larger cosmological abundances . as a result , the dark sector in such a scenario is _ dynamic _ : states in the dark sector are continually decaying into visible - sector states throughout the evolution of the universe  not just in previous epochs but even at the present time and into the future .",
    "quantities such as the total energy density @xmath0 and the effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath1 are thus time - dependent quantities , and it is only an accident that these quantities happen to take particular values at the present time .",
    "many methods have been developed for testing this framework , spanning from collider signatures  @xcite to signatures in direct - detection  @xcite and indirect - detection  @xcite experiments .",
    "of course , many of the constraints on such ddm ensembles depend on model - specific details associated with the ensemble in question , such as the specific particle nature of the individual dark constituent fields and the precise form of their decays into sm states .",
    "by contrast , other phenomenological properties of ( and constraints on ) these ddm ensembles depend simply on the manner in which the lifetimes and abundances of ensemble constituents scale with respect to each other , and thus have a greater degree of model - independence . for example",
    ", the effective equations of state for these ensembles are governed in large part solely by these scaling relations . as a result ,",
    "all phenomenological / observational constraints on the equations of state of the dark sector are essentially constraints on the types of balancing relations that ddm ensembles may exhibit .",
    "these are thus model - independent constraints which can be placed on such ensembles simply as a result of their inherent scaling relations .    one general class of ddm ensembles consisting of large numbers of dark particle species exhibiting suitable scaling relations between lifetimes and cosmological abundances are those whose constituents are the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of a gauge - neutral bulk field in a theory with extra spacetime dimensions in which cosmological abundances are established through misalignment production  @xcite .",
    "indeed , explicit realizations of ddm ensembles of this type have been constructed  @xcite .",
    "although many aspects of these ensembles depend on the details of the particular fields under study , certain general properties are common across all such ensembles in this class .",
    "one of these is that the cosmological abundance of each component scales as a power of the lifetime of that component .",
    "likewise , the density of states within such ensembles is either insensitive to mass or scales roughly as a polynomial function of mass across the ensemble . for these reasons ,",
    "most phenomenological studies of the ddm framework have focused on ensembles exhibiting polynomial scaling relationships .",
    "polynomial scaling relations also emerge in other ( purely four - dimensional ) contexts as well .",
    "for example , under certain circumstances , thermal freeze - out mechanisms for abundance generation can also lead to appropriate polynomial inverse scaling relations between lifetimes and abundances  @xcite .",
    "in fact , such inverse scaling relations can even emerge _ statistically _ in contexts in which the dynamics underlying the dark sector is essentially random  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , other well - motivated theoretical constructions which do not give rise to dark sectors with polynomial scaling relations .",
    "one example is a dark sector consisting of a set of fermions ( dark `` quarks '' ) charged under a non - abelian gauge group @xmath2 which becomes confining below some critical temperature @xmath3 . at temperatures @xmath4 ,",
    "when the theory is in the confining phase , the physical degrees of freedom are composite states ( dark `` hadrons '' ) .",
    "another well - motivated type of ddm ensemble consists of the bulk ( , closed - string ) states in type  i string theories .",
    "such bulk states are typically neutral with respect to all brane gauge symmetries , and interact with those brane states only gravitationally . as such , from the perspective of brane - localized observers , these bulk states too are dark matter .    at first glance",
    ", these two latter types of ensembles may seem to have little in common with each other .",
    "indeed , many aspects of the detailed phenomenologies associated with these ensembles will be completely different .",
    "however , they nevertheless exhibit certain underlying model - independent commonalities which are relevant for their viability as ddm ensembles .",
    "indeed , these features are identical to those which characterize the `` visible '' sector of ordinary hadrons , namely    * mass distributions which follow linear regge trajectories ( , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a corresponding regge slope ) , and * exponentially growing ( `` hagedorn - like '' ) degeneracies of states ( , @xmath7 ) .    these features  especially the appearance of an _ exponential _ scaling of the state degeneracies with mass  represent a behavior which is markedly different from that exhibited by ddm ensembles with polynomial scaling relations .",
    "for example , as a result of their exponentially growing densities of states , such ensembles have a critical temperature  @xcite beyond which their partition functions diverge .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the generic properties of ddm ensembles which exhibit the two features itemized above .",
    "we shall calculate the effective equations of state @xmath8 for such ensembles , and subject these ensembles to those immediate model - independent observational constraints that follow directly from these equations of state",
    ". we shall therefore be able to place zeroth - order model - independent bounds on some of the quantities that parametrize these features , such as the effective regge slope as well as the rate of exponential growth in the state degeneracies .",
    "our primary motivation is to understand the phenomenology that might apply to strongly - coupled dark sectors in their confined ( `` hadronic '' ) phase , imagining nothing more than that our ddm ensemble resembles the visible hadronic sector in the two respects itemized above .",
    "however , the results of such analyses might also be useful in constraining the bulk sector of various classes of string theories , since these bulk sectors also give rise to ensembles of dark - matter states which share these two grossest features . we shall therefore aim to keep our discussion as model - independent as possible , subject to our assumption of the above two properties itemized above . in this way",
    ", our analysis and the constraints we obtain can serve as useful phenomenological guides in eventually building realistic dark - matter models of this type .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : densityofstates ] , we begin by reviewing the properties that we shall assume for the mass spectrum and density of states of our ddm dark `` hadron '' ensemble .",
    "we shall also discuss the physical interpretations of these properties in terms of a variety of underlying flux - tube models and string theories .",
    "this section will also serve to establish our conventions and notation . then , in sect .",
    "[ sec : balancing ] , we discuss how the required balancing between lifetimes and abundances naturally arises for such ddm ensembles .",
    "in particular , we examine the mechanism through which primordial abundances for these hadron resonances are generated , and we determine how these abundances scale across the ensemble as a function of the hadron mass .",
    "we also discuss the scaling behavior of the decay widths that characterize the decays of the hadronic ensemble constituents to sm states , as well as the assumptions that enter into such calculations . in sect .",
    "[ sec : omegaetaweff ] , we then derive expressions for the total abundance @xmath9 , the tower fraction @xmath10 , and the effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath11 for these ddm ensemble as functions of time . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and reviewed in sect .",
    "[ sec : omegaetaweff ] , these three functions characterize the time - evolution of ddm ensembles and allow us to place a variety of general , model - independent constraints on such ensembles . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we then present the results of our analysis of the phenomenological viability of such ddm ensembles , identifying those regions of the corresponding parameter space which lead to the most promising ensembles and uncovering generic phenomenological behaviors and correlations across this space .",
    "one of our key findings is that these ddm ensembles can satisfy our constraints across a broad range of energy scales ranging from the gev scale all the way to the planck scale , but that the present - day cosmological abundance of the dark sector must be distributed across an increasing number of different states in the ensemble as the fundamental mass scales associated with the ensemble are dialed from the planck scale down to the gev scale .",
    "finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize our results and discuss possible avenues for future work .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , in this paper we are primarily concerned with the properties of ddm ensembles whose constituents are the `` hadronic '' composite states or resonances of a strongly - coupled dark sector . as has been well known since the 1960 s , many of the attributes of such an ensemble can be successfully modeled by strings .",
    "these attributes include linear regge trajectories , linear confinement , an exponential rise in hadron - state degeneracies , and @xmath12- and @xmath13-channel duality .",
    "it is not a complete surprise that there is a deep connection between hadronic spectroscopy and the spectra of string theory .",
    "hadronic resonances ( particularly mesons ) can be viewed as configurations of dark `` quarks '' linked together by flux tubes .",
    "the spectrum of excitations in such a theory therefore corresponds to the spectrum of fluctuations of these flux tubes .",
    "however , it is well known that these flux tubes can be modeled as non - critical strings .",
    "thus string theory can provide insight into the properties of such collections of composite states .    in what follows , we shall use this analogy between hadronic physics and string theory to motivate our parametrization for the mass spectrum and for the density of states of our dark-``hadronic '' ddm ensembles .",
    "we shall also make recourse to modern string technology , when needed , for refinements of our basic picture . throughout , however , we shall attempt to keep our parametrizations as general as possible so that they might apply to the widest possible set of ddm ensembles sharing these properties . as discussed in the introduction , this will allow our analysis and eventual constraints to serve as useful guides in future attempts to build realistic models exhibiting these features .      the first feature that we shall assume of our hadronic dark sector is a mass spectrum consistent with the existence of regge trajectories .",
    "the existence of such trajectories follows directly from nothing more than our assumption that our dark - sector bound states can be modeled by dark quarks connected by the confining flux tube associated with a strong , attractive , dark - sector interaction . taking meson - like configurations as our guide and temporarily assuming massless quarks",
    ", it can easily be shown that the mass @xmath14 associated with a relativistic rotating flux tube scales with the corresponding total angular momentum @xmath15 as , where @xmath6 is the so - called regge slope . in",
    "the _ visible _ sector , this successfully describes the so - called leading regge trajectory of the observed mesons , with appropriate for qcd .",
    "moreover , there also exist subleading ( parallel ) regge trajectories of observed mesons which have the same regge slope but different intercepts : @xmath16 .",
    "regge trajectories of this form , both leading and subleading , also emerge in string theory .",
    "for example , the perturbative states of a quantized open bosonic string have masses @xmath17 and spins @xmath18 which satisfy @xmath19 where @xmath6 is now the regge slope associated with string theory [ typically assumed to be @xmath20 .",
    "the states with @xmath21 thus sit along the leading regge trajectory , while those with smaller values of @xmath22 sit along the subleading regge trajectories .",
    "similar results also hold for superstrings and heterotic strings .    given these observations ,",
    "in this paper we shall assume that the states of our dark `` hadronic '' ddm ensemble have discrete positive masses @xmath14 of the general form @xmath23 where @xmath15 is an index labeling our states in order of increasing mass .",
    "here @xmath24 is the corresponding `` string scale '' , while @xmath25 represents the mass of the lightest `` hadronic '' constituent in the ddm ensemble . indeed , since we do not expect to have any tachyonic states in our ddm ensemble , we shall assume throughout this paper that @xmath26 .",
    "we shall avoid making any further assumptions about the nature of the dark sector by treating both @xmath27 and @xmath25 as free parameters to be eventually constrained by cosmological data .",
    "our choice of sign for @xmath28 perhaps deserves further comment . for the visible sector , most hadrons lie along regge trajectories with @xmath29 .",
    "while there do exist regge trajectories with @xmath30 , the lowest states in such trajectories are of course absent . in string theory , by contrast , all regge trajectories have @xmath30 .",
    "however , just as in the hadronic case , all tachyonic states which might result for small @xmath15 are ultimately removed from the string spectrum by certain `` projections '' which are ultimately required for the self - consistency of the string . in other words , for regge trajectories with @xmath30 , one could equivalently relabel our remaining states by shifting @xmath31 and thereby obtain an `` effective '' @xmath29 .",
    "this is not normally done in string theory because in string theory the index @xmath15 is correlated with other physical quantities such as the spin of the state .",
    "however we are making no such assumption for the states of our dark sector , and are treating the index @xmath15 as a mere labelling parameter .",
    "our assumption of a tachyon - free dark sector then leads us to take @xmath29 .",
    "there is also another motivation for taking @xmath29 .",
    "all of the above results which treat @xmath15 as an angular momentum assume massless quarks at the endpoints of the flux tube .",
    "however , while such an approximation holds well for the lightest states in the visible sector , we do not wish to make such an approximation for our unknown dark sector .",
    "we shall therefore assume @xmath29 in what follows , recognizing that this parameter may in principle also implicitly include the positive contributions from dark quark masses as well .",
    "the second generic feature associated with hadronic spectroscopy is the well - known exponential rise in the degeneracies of hadrons as a function of mass : .",
    "this behavior was first predicted and observed for hadrons ( both mesons and baryons ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also holds as a generic feature for both bosonic and fermionic states in string theory  @xcite .",
    "in general , we can understand this behavior as follows .",
    "if we model our hadrons as quarks connected by flux tubes , the degeneracy @xmath32 of hadronic states at any mass level @xmath15 can be written as the product of two contributions : one factor @xmath33 representing a multiplicity of states due to the degrees of freedom associated with the quarks ( such as the different possible configurations of quantities like spin and flavor ) , and a second factor @xmath34 representing the multiplicity of states due to the degrees of freedom associated with the flux tube .",
    "we thus have @xmath35 while @xmath33 is a constant which is independent of the particular mass level @xmath15 , the remaining degeneracy factor @xmath34 counts the rapidly increasing number of ways in which a state of given total energy @xmath15 can be realized as a combination of the vibrational , rotational , and internal excitations of the different harmonic oscillators which together comprise a quantized string .",
    "it is this quantity which grows exponentially with mass , and in string theory the leading behavior of @xmath34 for large @xmath15 generally takes the form  @xcite g_n   a n^-b e^c   as   n  , [ eq : fnforlargen ] where @xmath36 are all positive quantities which depend on the particular type of string model under study . indeed , for any @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", it turns out that the proper normalization for @xmath34 in string theory is given by a  =   1 ( c4)^2b-1  .",
    "thus our asymptotic degeneracy of states is parametrized by two independent quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and we shall assume that this continues to be true in our dark sector as well .",
    "the most salient property of the expression in eq .  ( [ eq : fnforlargen ] ) is that it rises exponentially with @xmath39 , or equivalently with the mass @xmath14 of the corresponding state .",
    "this represents a crucial difference relative to the kk - inspired ddm ensembles previously considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ( or even the purely four - dimensional ddm ensembles considered in refs .",
    "for example , the kk states corresponding to a single flat extra spacetime dimension have degeneracies @xmath34 which are constant , or which become so above the @xmath40 level .",
    "the key difference here is that the degrees of freedom associated with our flux tube consist of not only kk excitations ( if the flux tube happens to be situated within a spacetime with a compactified dimension ) , but also so - called _ oscillator _ excitations representing the internal fluctuations of the flux tube itself .",
    "it is these oscillator excitations which give rise to the exponentially growing degeneracies and which are a direct consequence of the non - zero spatial extent of the flux tube . as such",
    ", they are intrinsically stringy and would not arise in theories involving fundamental point particles .    unfortunately , the asymptotic form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnforlargen ] ) is not sufficient for our purposes .",
    "although we are interested in the behavior of all states across the ddm ensemble , it is the lighter states rather than the heavier states which are most likely to have longer lifetimes and therefore greater cosmological abundances .",
    "thus , even though we want to keep track of all of the states in our ensemble , we need to be particularly sensitive to the degeneracies of the lighter states , , the states with smaller values of @xmath15 .",
    "this poses a problem because the asymptotic expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnforlargen ] ) is fairly accurate in the large-@xmath15 limit but is not especially accurate in the small-@xmath15 limit .",
    "fortunately , for values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 which correspond to self - consistent strings ( to be discussed below ) , the tools of modern string technology ( specifically conformal field theory and modular invariance ) furnish us with a more precise approximation for @xmath34 which remains accurate even for very small values of @xmath15 .",
    "this expression is given by  @xcite g_n   2 ( - 1)^ - b i_|2b - |(c )  , [ eq : fnbetterapprox ] where @xmath41 denotes the modified bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath42 .",
    "use of the approximation @xmath43 for @xmath44 then reproduces the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnforlargen ] ) .",
    "however , the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnbetterapprox ] ) remains valid to within only a few percent all the way down to @xmath45 , assuming @xmath46 ( so that the argument of the bessel function remains real even for @xmath45 ) .    in what follows",
    ", we therefore shall adopt the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnbetterapprox ] ) as our general parametrization for the degeneracy of states @xmath34 for arbitrary values of @xmath37 and @xmath46 and for all @xmath47 . for values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 corresponding to bona - fide string theories ,",
    "this expression yields results for the state degeneracies which , though not necessarily integral , are highly accurate for all values of @xmath47 .",
    "an explicit example of this will be provided below . more generally , however , this expression is smooth and well - behaved for all values of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 parameters , and in all cases exhibits the exponential hagedorn - like behavior whose primary effects we seek to analyze in this paper .",
    "for @xmath40 , by contrast , we shall define @xmath48 , representing the unique ground state of our flux tube .",
    "thus far we have introduced four parameters to describe our dark `` hadron '' ddm ensemble : @xmath27 , @xmath25 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the first two parameters have immediate interpretations : @xmath25 is the mass of the lightest state in the ddm ensemble , while @xmath27 parametrizes the splitting between the states .",
    "we would now like to develop analogous physical interpretations of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .     clearly @xmath37 and @xmath38 describe the dynamics of the flux tube .",
    "however , in the case of the ordinary strong interaction , many possible theories governing this dynamics have been proposed .",
    "these range from early examples such as the scalar ( nambu ) string  @xcite , the ramond string  @xcite , and the neveu - schwarz  ( ns ) string  @xcite to more modern examples such as polyakov s `` rigid string ''  @xcite , green s `` dirichlet string ''  @xcite , and the polchinski - strominger `` effective string ''  @xcite .",
    "many other possibilities and variants have also been proposed .",
    "all of these theories begin by imagining a one - dimensional line of flux energy ( , a string ) which sweeps out a two - dimensional flux - sheet ( or worldsheet ) as it sweeps through an external @xmath49-dimensional spacetime . here",
    "@xmath49 is the number of spacetime dimensions which are effectively uncompactified with respect to the fundamental energy scale @xmath27 associated with the flux tube . as such ,",
    "as it propagates , our string / flux tube is free to fluctuate into any of the spatial dimensions transverse to the string .",
    "we can describe such fluctuations by specifying @xmath50 embedding functions @xmath51 , , which are nothing but the transverse spacetime locations of any point on the flux - tube worldsheet with coordinates @xmath52 . as such , these embedding functions may be regarded as fields on the two - dimensional flux - tube worldsheet .",
    "the dynamics of this system is then governed by the polyakov action s  ~   m_s^2 d^2 _ i=1^d _ ( ^ x^i ) ( _ x^i )  .",
    "[ scalarstring ] minimizing this action is classically equivalent to minimizing the area of the flux - tube worldsheet .    by itself , the expression in eq .",
    "( [ scalarstring ] ) describes the action of the so - called @xmath50-dimensional `` scalar '' string . in some sense",
    "this theory provides the simplest possible description of a strongly - interacting flux tube , with the term in eq .",
    "( [ scalarstring ] ) representing the bare minimum that must always be present for any flux - tube description .",
    "the various possible refinements of this basic theory then differ in the extra terms that might be added to this action .",
    "some of these theories mentioned above introduce extra terms which correspond to additional , purely internal degrees of freedom [ , additional fields analogous to @xmath51 but without interpretations as the coordinates of uncompactified spacetime dimensions ] on the flux - tube worldsheet .",
    "by contrast , other theories introduce extra interaction terms for the @xmath53-fields which alter their short - distance behavior .    the action in eq .",
    "( [ scalarstring ] ) can be interpreted as that of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) field theory ( where the two dimensions are those of the flux - tube worldsheet ) , and we immediately see that it is endowed with a 2d conformal symmetry .",
    "there are good reasons to expect that the long - distance limit of any self - consistent flux - tube theory should exhibit such a symmetry , since we expect the physics of this system to be invariant under reparametrizations of our flux - tube worldsheet coordinates . as a result",
    ", those flux - tube theories that augment the scalar string by introducing extra purely internal degrees of freedom on the flux - tube worldsheet must not break this conformal symmetry ; this requirement constrains what kinds of terms can be added . by contrast , the theories that introduce extra interaction terms for the @xmath53 fields do break this conformal symmetry , but they do so only in the short - distance limit .",
    "the 2d conformal symmetry of the long - distance limit is then preserved as an effective symmetry .    in any 2d conformal field theory , either exact or effective ,",
    "the total number of degrees of freedom is encoded within the so - called _ central charge _",
    "each @xmath53 field contributes a central charge @xmath55 , and thus the minimal scalar - string action in eq .",
    "( [ scalarstring ] ) describes a theory with central charge @xmath56 .",
    "however the introduction of additional degrees of freedom on the flux - tube worldsheet will necessarily increase the central charge , producing a theory with @xmath57 .",
    "given a particular action for our flux - tube dynamics , it is straightforward to quantize the fields in question . in this way",
    ", we can determine the corresponding spectrum of the theory at all mass levels .",
    "these calculations are standard in string theory ( see , , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and ultimately one obtains  @xcite asymptotic state degeneracies @xmath34 of the forms given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnforlargen ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnbetterapprox ] ) .",
    "remarkably , one finds a relatively straightforward connection between the parameters @xmath58 appearing in our state degeneracies and the parameters @xmath59 of our underlying flux - tube theory  @xcite :    b = 14(3+d _ ) c =  .",
    "[ stringvars ] indeed , for any value of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we may regard the total central charge @xmath54 as having two contributions : one contribution @xmath60 associated with the degrees of freedom associated with the transverse uncompactified spacetime fluctuations of the flux tube , and a remaining contribution c_int   c - d _   3 c^2 2 ^ 2 - 4b + 3 [ stringvars2 ] associated with those additional , purely internal degrees of freedom which might also exist within the full flux - tube theory ( including those associated with any _ compactified _ spacetime dimensions which may also exist ) .    at first glance",
    ", it might seem that our dark sector must have @xmath61 , just as does our visible sector",
    ". this would certainly be true if our dark - sector flux tube were to experience the same spacetime geometry as does the visible sector .",
    "however , we emphasize that in a string - theoretic or `` braneworld '' context , the dark sector could correspond to physics in the `` bulk ''  , physics perpendicular to the brane on which the visible - sector resides .",
    "the degrees of freedom in the bulk would then be able to interact with those on the brane at most gravitationally , and would thus constitute dark matter by construction .",
    "however , the geometric properties of the bulk will generally differ from those of the brane  the bulk might contain not only extra spacetime dimensions which are effectively large ( , uncompactified ) with respect to the fundamental string scale , but also extra spacetime dimensions which are small ( , compactified ) .",
    "the bulk may also be populated by additional fields with no spacetime interpretations at all .",
    "it is for this reason that we make no assumptions about the values of @xmath54 or @xmath50 associated with the dark sector .",
    "once our flux - tube theory is specified and the corresponding values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 determined , we may calculate the corresponding effective static - quark potential @xmath62 between two quarks a distance @xmath63 apart .",
    "we find  @xcite v(r ) & = & ( m_s2 ) + & & m_s^2 r2 - c^216 1r  +  ...   for   rm_s^-1  .",
    "the first term in the final expression indicates a linear confinement potential , as expected ; this is nothing but the classical energy in the flux tube .",
    "by contrast , the second term resembles a coulomb term but is actually an attractive universal quantum correction ( or casimir energy ) which arises due to the transverse zero - point vibrations of the flux tube .    for visible - sector hadrons ,",
    "it is natural to take @xmath64 . as a result , the @xmath61 scalar string with @xmath65 ( corresponding to @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) is the `` minimal '' string that we expect to underlie all descriptions of the actual visible - sector qcd flux tube .",

    "( [ stringvars ] ) that we may describe our resulting spectrum as corresponding to that of a classically self - consistent string moving in a specific geometry .",

    "note , in this regard , that the degrees of freedom associated with fluctuations into extra _ compactified _ spacetime dimensions count towards @xmath71 rather than @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in terms of its effects on the dark sector , the act of compactifying a spacetime dimension to a radius below the associated string scale preserves the central charge @xmath54 ( and thus the coefficient @xmath38 ) and merely shifts the associated degrees of freedom from @xmath50 to @xmath71 .",

    "[ sec : constraints ] , @xmath11 plays an important role in constraining the parameter space of these ddm ensembles .",
    "given our time - dependent aggregate quantities @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath8 , we now turn to the cosmological constraints that bound these functions . in this way",
    ", we shall ultimately be placing non - trivial constraints on the parameter space underlying these hadronic ddm ensembles .    in this connection",
    ", we again stress that our aim in this paper is not to perform a detailed analysis of the astrophysical and/or cosmological constraints on this parameter space",
    ". such a detailed analysis would clearly be an important but extensive task which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "moreover , such an analysis would require a host of further assumptions concerning the particular nature of our ensemble , the specific decay modes of its constituents into sm states , and so forth .",
    "rather , in this paper , our goal is to simply to obtain a rough initial sense of those regions of parameter space in which a ddm ensemble of dark `` hadrons '' might have at least the _ potential _ of phenomenological viability .",
    "accordingly , in what follows , we shall put forth a set of requirements which directly constrain the fundamental quantities @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 we have defined above , but which do not require any further information concerning these hadronic ensembles beyond those properties already discussed . in some sense , then , these might be viewed as the immediate `` zeroth - order '' model - independent constraints that any ddm ensemble of this sort must satisfy .",
    "our first constraint is an obvious one : despite the presence of an infinite tower of dark - hadronic resonances , each with its own cosmological abundance and lifetime , we shall demand that ( t_now )  =    0.26  .",
    "[ constraint1 ] this requirement is clearly predicated on the assumption that our dark - hadronic ensemble represents the totality of the dark sector ; for other cases we would simply require that @xmath183 .",
    "as we shall see , in either situation this is a severe and unavoidable constraint which ultimately `` anchors '' our entire construction in terms of actual numbers and mass scales .",
    "second , we may also consider the _ time - variation _ of @xmath9 .",
    "the time - variation of this total abundance is constrained by experimental probes which yield information about the dark - matter abundance during different cosmological epochs .",
    "for example , cmb data  @xcite provides information about the dark - matter abundance around the time of last scattering  , at a redshift @xmath184 , or equivalently a time of roughly @xmath185 . on the other hand , observational data on baryon acoustic oscillations  @xcite and the relationship between luminosity and redshift for type  ia supernovae  @xcite",
    "provide information about @xmath98 and the dark - energy abundance @xmath186 at subsequent times , down to redshifts of around @xmath187 . within the context of the @xmath188cdm cosmology",
    ", the agreement between these different measurements implies that the dark - matter abundance has not changed dramatically since the time of last scattering .    in order be consistent with this result",
    ", we shall therefore demand that the total abundance of our ddm ensemble not vary by more than 5% between an early `` look - back '' time @xmath189 and today : @xmath190 in what follows , we shall choose a look - back time @xmath191 , which lies comfortably before the recombination epoch .",
    "in addition to these constraints on the time - variation of the dark - matter abundance , there are further considerations which constrain the decays of the ddm - ensemble constituents more directly .",
    "these constraints depend on the decay properties of the dark - sector particles and are thus ultimately model - dependent . however ,",
    "for those rather general cases in which the ensemble constituents can decay to final states involving visible - sector particles , one must ensure that these decay products not disrupt big - bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite , not produce observable distortions in the cmb  @xcite , not reionize the universe  @xcite , and not violate current limits on the fluxes of photons or other cosmic - ray particles  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "even if the ensemble constituents decay exclusively into other , lighter dark - sector particles , such decays can nevertheless leave observable imprints on small - scale structure  @xcite , alter the scale- and redshift - dependence of the cosmological gravitational - lensing power spectrum  @xcite , and affect the luminosity - redshift relation for type  ia supernovae  @xcite .",
    "since these effects all arise from the decays of ensemble constituents , non - observation of these effects also leads to constraints on the time - variation of @xmath192 .",
    "some of these latter constraints admittedly depend on model - dependent aspects of the decay kinematics of the dark - ensemble constituents",
    ". however the strongest and most general of these constraints effectively amount to limits on the variation of @xmath9 within the recent past  , for redshifts @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , in addition to our look - back - time constraint in eq .",
    "( [ constraint2 ] ) , we shall also impose an additional constraint on our effective equation - of - state parameter : ( )  0.05  .",
    "[ constraint3 ] through eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdef ] ) , this thus becomes a constraint on the present - day _ time - derivative _ of @xmath9 .",
    "it is important to stress that this constraint is independent of that in eq .",
    "( [ constraint2 ] ) : while eq .",
    "( [ constraint2 ] ) constrains accumulated changes in @xmath9 over a relatively long interval , eq .",
    "( [ constraint3 ] ) constrains the time - variation of @xmath9 near the present time .",
    "other considerations will also guide our interest in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "for example , from a ddm - inspired standpoint , we are particularly interested in scenarios for which ( )  ~   o(1 )  , [ constraint4 ] , scenarios in which the present - day value of @xmath162 is significantly different from zero .",
    "this ensures that a sizable number of ensemble constituents continue to survive and contribute meaningfully to @xmath194 at the present time , with dark - matter decays occurring _ throughout _ the present epoch and not just in the distant past or future .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ constraint4 ] ) is not a strict requirement for phenomenological consistency , this condition guides the degree to which we may regard our ensemble as being fully ddm - like , with a significant portion of the ensemble playing a non - trivial role in the phenomenology of the dark sector .",
    "for example , this condition rules out regions of parameter space in which @xmath195 for all @xmath47 , with @xmath196 . in such regions of parameter space",
    ", all excited dark - hadronic states have decayed prior to our look - back time , leaving us with a single dark - hadronic ground state in the present epoch .",
    "such a scenario trivially satisfies all of our phenomenological constraints on the time - variations of the total dark - sector abundance , but is effectively no different from that of a traditional , single - component dark sector .",
    "it is thus less interesting from a ddm perspective .",
    "there are two further phenomenological constraints which will be useful for us to consider in the following .",
    "first , we shall demand that @xmath197 .",
    "although we do not necessarily require @xmath198 as in traditional single - component dark sectors , we generally expect that @xmath147 must exceed @xmath199 by at least several orders of magnitude in order to satisfy look - back and @xmath1 constraints .",
    "this assumption will be discussed further in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "likewise , although we have thus far assumed @xmath200 throughout our analysis , we actually must impose the somewhat stronger bound @xmath201 in order to satisfy bbn and structure - formation constraints .",
    "this last requirement implicitly assumes that our lightest ensemble component carries the largest cosmological abundance ( or at least a sizable fraction of the total cosmological abundance ) , but we shall see in sect .  [",
    "sec : results ] that this turns out to be true for the vast majority of phenomenologically interesting cases .",
    "finally , we shall also make certain simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , for concreteness , we shall restrict our attention to situations with @xmath202 .",
    "in other words , we shall assume that the dominant contributions to the decay lifetimes @xmath151 of our ddm constituents @xmath203 scale as @xmath204 across the ddm ensemble .",
    "decay widths of the form @xmath205 emerge naturally from operators such as @xmath206 where @xmath188 parametrizes the energy scale associated with such couplings and where @xmath207 denotes a field - strength tensor associated with either the visible - sector ( sm ) photon or a dark - radiation photon associated with an additional abelian gauge group under which the ensemble constituents are not charged .",
    "the contributions from such operators will dominate the decays of our ddm constituents in scenarios in which our ddm ensemble is uncharged with respect to all sm symmetries , and in which intra - ensemble decays can be neglected .",
    "likewise , we shall also make the simplifying assumption that @xmath208 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gnintermsoffn ] ) .",
    "this restricts us to the bare `` minimal '' case in which we do not ascribe non - trivial degrees of freedom to our dark - sector quarks , and thereby focus exclusively on the ensemble of states generated by our infinite tower of hadronic resonances .",
    "finally , throughout our analysis , we shall continue to impose the self - consistency constraints listed in eqs .",
    "( [ strongconstraint ] ) [ or equivalently ( [ weakconstraint ] ) ] , ( [ eq : bstringconsistcond ] ) , ( [ eq : cstringconsistcond ] ) , and ( [ tclimit ] ) .",
    "thus , going forward , the free parameters governing our dark - hadron ddm ensemble may be tallied as follows .",
    "first , there are the two parameters @xmath209 which govern the individual state degeneracies @xmath34 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnbetterapprox ] ) .",
    "second , there are the four parameters @xmath210 which govern the individual abundances @xmath112 in eqs .",
    "( [ expfactor ] ) through ( [ omega0r ] ) .",
    "however , imposing eq .",
    "( [ constraint1 ] ) as an overall normalization condition allows us to remove @xmath25 as a free parameter .",
    "thus , for the rest of this paper , we shall consider our ddm ensembles as functions of their locations within the five - dimensional parameter space corresponding to the variables @xmath211 where @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 .",
    "in general , we seek to determine which values of our defining parameters @xmath215 lead to self - consistent and potentially viable dark sectors  , sectors which satisfy our abundance , look - back , and @xmath1 constraints in eqs .",
    "( [ constraint1 ] ) , ( [ constraint2 ] ) , and ( [ constraint3 ] ) respectively , along with our @xmath216 constraint . for each such set , we also seek to determine the corresponding values of relevant mass scales such as the string scale @xmath27 .",
    "we also seek to determine the extent to which the corresponding ensemble is truly ddm - like , with a relatively large number of component states playing a significant role in the phenomenology of the dark sector and contributing to @xmath192 at the present time .",
    "in general , the larger the value of @xmath217 , the more ddm - like the corresponding ensemble .    at first glance",
    ", it might seem rather daunting to orient ourselves within the five - dimensional @xmath215 parameter space .",
    "however , there are really two separate parts to our analysis  one part which depends only on _ relative _ mass scales , and one part which makes explicit reference to _ absolute _ mass scales .",
    "it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ omegatot ] ) and ( [ omega0timenow ] ) that once we know @xmath218 , we can determine the function @xmath219 up to an overall multiplicative constant @xmath220 . setting @xmath221",

    "this also determines the corresponding values of @xmath222 and @xmath223 . up to this point , we have not yet anchored our results in terms of absolute mass scales .",
    "however , this can also easily be done : we simply set our required numerical value of @xmath220 to the expression in either eq .",
    "( [ omega0nr ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ omega0r ] ) .",
    "this then determines an absolute value for the mass scale @xmath25 , whereupon we find that @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "thus , in this way , we can extract the values for @xmath27 and @xmath222 corresponding to every point in the @xmath218 parameter space .",

    "we therefore find that eq .",
    "( [ omega0constraint ] ) can be satisfied only if @xmath232 .",

    "considering greater values of @xmath234 only worsens this situation and requires even greater values of @xmath235 .",

    "[ fig3 ] .",

    "the thin black curve indicates the contour with @xmath245 , and thus serves as the nominal dividing line between the regions in which the lowest ensemble state is relativistic ( above and to the left ) or non - relativistic ( below and to the right ) .",
    "several things are immediately apparent from this figure .",
    "first , we see that the portion of the parameter space corresponding to the relativistic case is excluded by our constraint on @xmath25 .",
    "this is entirely in keeping with our conclusions already reached above .",
    "nevertheless , we also see that beyond this region there exists an entire area of parameter space in which all of our constraints are satisfied .",
    "moreover , within this region we see that @xmath27 varies from the kev / mev - range all the way to the planck scale .",
    "likewise , @xmath222 varies through all of its possible values .",
    "this is therefore not only an allowed region , but one which is likely to be exceedingly rich in phenomenology .",
    "indeed , given the contours plotted in this figure , we see that the `` sweet spot '' within the @xmath240 parameter space lies roughly within the range    1r6  0.05 s 0.18  .",
    "[ sweetspot ] this is the region of @xmath240 parameter space where the plotted blue and magenta contours intersect each other and form a `` cross - hatched '' region , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "this sweet spot is therefore the region that will be of maximum interest to us . indeed , within this region",
    ", we observe from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that @xmath222 increases if either @xmath143 or @xmath12 is increased , while @xmath27 increases in the former case but decreases in the latter .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] focuses on this sweet - spot region and shows the same @xmath27 and @xmath162 contours , only now plotted with respect to the variables @xmath238 and @xmath12 using a linear rather than logarithmic axis .",
    "the fact that the @xmath27 contours are approximately vertical in this region indicates that @xmath27 is dominantly determined by the ratio @xmath238 , exactly as anticipated above , with increasing values of @xmath238 corresponding to increasing values of @xmath27 .",

    "[ fig3 ] that @xmath27 increases extremely rapidly as a function of @xmath238 , in keeping with the exponential dependence in eq .",

    "likewise , increasing the value of @xmath238 while holding @xmath143 fixed tends to _ decrease _ the value of @xmath222 .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath143 , we find that @xmath27 and @xmath222 tend to vary inversely with respect to each other as functions of @xmath238 , with our ensembles becoming less ddm - like at higher mass scales and more ddm - like at lower mass scales . likewise , for fixed @xmath238 ,",
    "we find that increasing @xmath143 tends to increase @xmath222 , as already evident from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "it is easy to understand these results physically .",
    "for fixed @xmath143 , increasing @xmath238 corresponds to decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "this lowers the critical temperature @xmath3 at which our initial cosmological abundances are established , which has the effect of decreasing the abundances of the heavier states relative to the lighter states .",
    "this therefore decreases the value of @xmath222 .",
    "by contrast , holding @xmath238 fixed and increasing @xmath143 corresponds to increasing @xmath12 as well . the increase in @xmath143",
    "renders all of the ensemble states more massive but provides a smaller proportional mass increase for the heavier states than for the lighter states .",
    "thus the mass _ ratios _ between heavier and lighter states decreases , which tends to increase the value of @xmath222 .",

    "[ fig4 ] that increasing @xmath38 generally tends to increase @xmath222 .",
    "this result makes sense : increasing @xmath38 corresponds to increasing the _ degeneracies _ of the heavier states relative to the lighter states .",
    "however , with @xmath12 held constant , each of these heavier states continues to accrue the same abundance as before . thus increasing @xmath38 increases the total abundance carried by the heavier states relative to that carried by the lighter states , thereby increasing @xmath222 .",
    "second , we see from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that while our values of @xmath27 and @xmath222 are quite sensitive to @xmath38 , they are far less sensitive to @xmath37 .",
    "this too makes sense , since @xmath38 governs the exponential rate of growth in the state degeneracies while @xmath37 governs only the subleading polynomial behavior .",
    "third , in each of the above two cases , we also note that increasing @xmath38 while holding @xmath143 or @xmath37 fixed also corresponds to decreasing @xmath27 .",
    "thus , once again , we see that @xmath27 and @xmath222 tend to vary inversely with each other , giving rise to more ddm - like ensembles at lower energy scales and more traditional ensembles at higher energy scales .",
    "finally , we see from the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that our values of @xmath222 are largely _ insensitive _ to variations in @xmath38 as long as @xmath248 is held fixed . however , this too is easy to understand .",
    "increasing @xmath38 while holding @xmath248 fixed corresponds to decreasing @xmath12 as we increase @xmath38 .",
    "increasing @xmath38 induces an exponential increase in the degeneracy of each massive state , while decreasing @xmath12 decreases the critical temperature @xmath3 , thereby inducing a corresponding exponential decrease in the abundance associated with each such state .",
    "thus , to first approximation , these two effects tend to mitigate each other : they produce more states , but also cause each state to carry a correspondingly smaller abundance .",
    "0.05 truein     thus far we have not discussed the effects of varying our remaining free parameter @xmath147 .",
    "varying @xmath147 does not affect the degeneracies of states or their cosmological abundances .",
    "indeed , variations in @xmath147 affect only the _ lifetimes _ of these states . in principle , this has the potential to affect the values of quantities such as @xmath222 since the determination of @xmath222 requires totalling the abundances of only those states which have not yet decayed at the present time .",
    "however , under the assumption that @xmath249 ( or under the equivalent assumption that our scenario already satisfies the look - back and @xmath1 constraints ) , we know that @xmath250 is not changing rapidly at the present time . in other words , the total abundances of those states which are decaying at the present time",

    "the @xmath27 and @xmath222 contours are therefore largely insensitive to @xmath147 . indeed , in fig .",

    "having explored the relevant @xmath262 parameter space of our ensemble and identified our sweet - spot region , we now examine the characteristics of the corresponding ensembles in more detail . in particular , we seek to understand what these ensembles look like , and how their overall structure evolves with time . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ quantities ] , the most relevant aggregate properties of any dark - sector ensemble are its total cosmological abundance @xmath9 , its effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath11 , and its tower fraction @xmath10 , each of which is generally time - dependent .",
    "we therefore begin by examining how each of these quantities evolves with time for ensembles in and near our sweet spot .",
    "this information is shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "in this figure , we consider a `` benchmark '' ensemble with @xmath66 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 , as well as nearby ensembles in which @xmath147 is varied ( top row ) , @xmath143 is varied ( second row ) , @xmath12 is varied ( third row ) , @xmath38 is varied ( fourth row ) , and @xmath37 is varied ( fifth row ) . in each case",
    ", we plot the corresponding total cosmological abundance @xmath192 ( left column ) , equation - of - state parameter @xmath1 ( middle column ) , and tower fraction @xmath162 ( right column ) as functions of time .",
    "note that in each case the overall abundance is normalized through an appropriate choice of @xmath27 such that @xmath267 , as required .                     in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( except for those along the bottom row ) , the blue curve corresponds to our `` benchmark '' point .",
    "we therefore begin by focussing on these benchmark curves .",
    "the curve for @xmath268 appears nearly constant at @xmath269 for all of the cosmological history plotted ( which we assume to have been matter - dominated ) , including the present time @xmath270 .",
    "indeed , this behavior continues all the way into the future until @xmath271 , at which point @xmath268 begins to decline gently to @xmath272 .",
    "this behavior is matched by @xmath8 , which remains near zero for most its cosmological evolution before gently rising to @xmath273 at @xmath271 .",
    "this makes sense , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdef ] ) tells us that @xmath8 is proportional to the time - derivative of @xmath268 .",
    "finally , we see that @xmath10 remains more or less fixed at approximately @xmath274 during most of its cosmological history before smoothly dropping to @xmath275 .",
    "this behavior is easy to understand . if this has been a traditional ensemble with a single dark - matter component whose decay we could model as essentially instantaneous ( just as we are assuming for the individual components of our dark - matter ensembles ) , our curve for @xmath268 would have been fixed precisely at its present value @xmath269 over the entire range shown until suddenly dropping ( essentially discontinuously ) to @xmath272 when the single dark - matter particle decays at @xmath271 .",
    "likewise , @xmath8 would have been strictly fixed at @xmath276 during the cosmological evolution , while @xmath10 would have been fixed at zero all along .",
    "however , this is not a traditional dark - matter setup : this is a ddm ensemble in which the present - day cosmological abundance @xmath277 is spread across a relatively large number of individual components with different masses and different lifetimes .",
    "it is thus the continued , ordered , sequential decays of these different components which produce the softer , gentler drop in @xmath268 as @xmath13 approaches @xmath271 .",
    "in fact , @xmath268 is actually falling slightly _ throughout _ the cosmological evolution shown ; this behavior is not visible in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] only because at early times prior to @xmath271 the states which are decaying are extremely heavy and thus carry extremely small abundances .",
    "by contrast , at late times approaching @xmath278 , the states which are decaying are relatively low - lying and carry more significant abundances .",
    "this is also evident in our curve for @xmath10 : for most of the cosmological history , the value @xmath274 tells us that only approximately @xmath279 of the total dark - sector cosmological abundance is carried by the dominant ( lightest ) state in the ensemble , even at early times , while the remaining @xmath280 of the abundance is carried by the more massive states  particularly those which , though more massive , are nevertheless relatively low - lying . as a result of the sequential decays of such states , @xmath10  like @xmath9  is also actually falling slightly _ throughout _ the cosmological evolution shown .",
    "it is only due to the decays of the relatively low - lying states near @xmath271 that @xmath10 ultimately falls gently but noticeably to zero .    at first glance",
    ", it may seem surprising that all three of our primary quantities @xmath192 , @xmath1 , and @xmath162 are nearly constant at @xmath281",
    ". however , this is ultimately the direct consequence of our benchmark choice @xmath282 : with this choice , those states within the ensemble which are decaying today are all extremely massive and thus carry very little abundance .",
    "the ddm nature of such an ensemble is nevertheless clear from its @xmath162-value , which is as high as @xmath283 even at the present time . in this connection",
    ", we again emphasize that taking @xmath282 was merely a conservative choice which is not by itself intrinsic to the ddm framework ; indeed we learned from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that we could easily have chosen @xmath147 as small as @xmath284 without running afoul of our look - back and @xmath253 constraints .",
    "indeed , without further details concerning the precise nature of these ensembles ( including , most critically , the ultimate decay products of their constituents ) , such small values for @xmath147 would have been equally viable .",
    "this observation is illustrated along the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where we show the evolution of our blue `` benchmark '' curves as we vary @xmath147 between our conservative value @xmath285 and the more extreme value @xmath286 . in general , changing @xmath147 does not affect the internal structure of the ensemble  it merely affects the lifetimes of the individual ensemble constituents , rescaling them all up or down together .",
    "since it is these lifetimes which produce the non - trivial time - dependence for @xmath194 , @xmath253 , and @xmath162 , we expect that changing @xmath147 should preserve the general shapes of these curves and merely translate these curves along the time axis .",
    "this behavior is verified in the panels along the top row of fig .",
    "indeed , we can even see from these panels why @xmath287 is the minimum value of @xmath147 that may be chosen for our benchmark point : choosing @xmath147 any smaller would shift our curves even further towards earlier times , whereupon @xmath9 would begin to experience significant variations within the interval @xmath288 and @xmath223 would begin to deviate significantly from zero .",
    "such behavior would then violate our look - back and @xmath253 constraints , respectively .",
    "let us now turn to the behavior of our @xmath194 , @xmath253 , and @xmath162 curves as we vary @xmath143 , as shown in the panels along the second row of fig .",
    "two observations underlie the behavior shown .",
    "first , we note that changing @xmath143 changes the lifetimes of the states at each mass level according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lifetimes ] ) , with @xmath289 as @xmath290 .",
    "this result is simple to understand : as @xmath290 , the @xmath40 states become hierarchically lighter than the @xmath72 states and thus the @xmath168 states have hierarchically shorter lifetimes .",
    "second , we note that changing @xmath143 also changes the relative abundances which are generated at @xmath92 according to  =   ( - )  .",
    "[ nonmon ] this quantity is non - monotonic as a function of @xmath143 , first dropping as @xmath143 is reduced from large values and ultimately hitting a minimum before increasing again and diverging as @xmath290 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath45 and @xmath12 set to its benchmark value @xmath291 , this minimum occurs at @xmath292 .",
    "these two effects are responsible for the behaviors shown in the second row of fig .",
    "as @xmath143 decreases from its benchmark value with @xmath147 held fixed , the excited states with @xmath168 start decaying earlier and earlier .",
    "rescaling our overall abundances in order to keep @xmath293 produces the effects shown in the left panel .",
    "indeed , we see from this panel that the case with @xmath294 actually violates our look - back and @xmath253 constraints , as already evident from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . even the @xmath9 curve with @xmath295",
    "is tightly constrained : shifting @xmath147 towards any smaller values below @xmath296 ( , shifting this curve further towards the left ) also leads to violations of our look - back and @xmath253 constraints , as already anticipated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . likewise , as a result of the observations below eq .",
    "( [ nonmon ] ) , the relative sizes of the abundances @xmath90 associated with the excited @xmath168 states relative to the abundance @xmath142 associated with the @xmath40 ground state vary non - monotonically with @xmath143 , shrinking as @xmath143 drops from 3.5 to approximately 0.4 , and then growing again as @xmath143 drops still further .",
    "this then explains the non - monotonic behavior for @xmath10 as a function of @xmath143 , as shown in the right panel .",
    "by contrast , the effects of varying @xmath12 and @xmath38 are shown along the third and fourth rows of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , respectively .",
    "while the quantity @xmath12 governs the exponential rate at which the boltzmann suppression of the abundances of the ensemble constituents _ decreases _ with @xmath15 , the quantity @xmath38 governs the exponential rate at which the the degeneracy of states for the ensemble _ grows _ with @xmath15 . as a result ,",
    "the effects of decreasing @xmath12 or increasing @xmath38 are largely similar to each other as far as @xmath9 is concerned , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] : both tend to increase the primordial aggregate abundances @xmath297 of the heavier states in the ensemble .",
    "this effect causes @xmath9 to begin to decline earlier and earlier as these heavier states are the first to decay .",
    "by contrast , it is important to note that increasing @xmath38 and decreasing @xmath12 nevertheless have _ opposite _ effects on the value of @xmath222 : the former increases @xmath222 , as anticipated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , while the latter decreases @xmath222 , as anticipated in fig .",
    "this difference occurs because increasing @xmath38 merely increases the state degeneracies @xmath34 of the heavy states , thereby injecting more abundance into the heavy states relative to the light states , while decreasing @xmath12 has the effect of increasing the abundances of _ all _ of our states , including the abundance of the dominant abundance - carrier at @xmath40 .",
    "this causes the total abundance of the ensemble to grow more rapidly than the abundances of the excited @xmath168 states alone , thereby decreasing @xmath222 .",
    "one important feature to note from these plots is the appearance of a hagedorn instability as @xmath298 ( or equivalently as @xmath299 ) . in these limiting cases , the total energy density @xmath194 injected into the system through our confining phase transition at @xmath94",
    "diverges , violating the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ finitetotal ] ) .",
    "such cases therefore violate our look - back and @xmath253 constraints , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . indeed , the hagedorn instability is a critical feature of theories with exponentially growing degeneracies of states  @xcite .",
    "finally , we turn to the fifth and final row of fig .",
    "note that in order to remain within the self - consistency bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cstringconsistcond ] ) , it is not possible to increase @xmath37 above our benchmark value @xmath69 when @xmath263 . for this reason ,",
    "we have chosen to hold @xmath38 fixed at a greater value , specifically @xmath300 , when exploring the effects of varying @xmath37 .",
    "unfortunately , we see that variations in @xmath37 are barely distinguishable in these plots , even when @xmath37 is varied all the way from @xmath301 ( corresponding to @xmath302 ) to @xmath303 ( corresponding to @xmath304 ) .",
    "this tells us that the sorts of abundance - based or equation - of - state - based analyses we are doing here are relatively insensitive to the number of uncompactified transverse spacetime directions into which our dark - sector flux tube can vibrate , as long as @xmath38 ( related to the total central charge of the degrees of freedom on the flux - tube worldsheet ) is held fixed .",
    "of course , in a realistic setting , there are likely to be many other more specific probes of @xmath50 , including probes that are based on specific properties of the dark - sector dynamics .",
    "our result here merely indicates that studies based on cosmological abundances alone are not likely to be the most useful in this regard .",

    "[ fig6 ] how the total abundances @xmath194 of our ddm ensembles vary as a function of time .",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for our benchmark ddm model . as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , there are many mass levels @xmath15 whose states contribute to @xmath250 : states with smaller values of @xmath15 carry larger abundances and have longer lifetimes , persisting into later times before decaying , while those with larger values of @xmath15 carry smaller abundances and have shorter lifetimes , decaying earlier . indeed , this balancing between lifetimes and abundances is a fundamental hallmark of the ddm framework .",
    "although the sum of these abundances at @xmath306 is fixed at @xmath307 , we see that even states with relatively large values of @xmath15 have lifetimes @xmath151 exceeding @xmath270 and thus contribute non - trivially to @xmath250 .",
    "indeed , for our benchmark model , we find that there are no fewer than seven distinct mass levels contributing more than 0.01 to @xmath250 and no fewer than ten distinct mass levels contributing more than @xmath308 of @xmath250 .",
    "0.5 truein             0.3 truein    it is also interesting to examine how these results vary as a function of the ratio @xmath238 which , as we have seen , governs the overall mass scales associated with these ddm ensembles .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "let us begin by focusing on the `` benchmark '' pie chart within fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] corresponding to @xmath264 and @xmath321 . for this pie chart",
    ", we see that the largest pie slice corresponds to the abundance contribution from the @xmath40 mass level , while the successively smaller pie slices progressing in a clockwise fashion within the pie chart correspond to the abundance contributions from successively higher mass levels . for this pie chart",
    ", we find that @xmath322  gev , @xmath323  gev , and @xmath324  gev .",
    "note that this value for @xmath27 is in agreement with the @xmath27 contours shown in fig .",
    "we also see geometrically from this pie chart that @xmath274 , in agreement with the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , and [ fig6 ] .    given this , we can now investigate how this benchmark pie chart deforms as a function of @xmath238 and @xmath143 .",
    "results are illustrated in the other pie charts shown in fig .",
    "we see in general that increasing @xmath143 from 3.5 to 4.0 ( , passing from the top row of pie charts in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] to the bottom row ) has the net effect of shifting cosmological abundance away from the ground state , thereby increasing @xmath162 and generally making each pie slice smaller while simultaneously lowering the corresponding mass scales .",
    "this is in complete accord with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . likewise , decreasing or increasing @xmath238 ( , moving left or right along either row ) has the effect of increasing or decreasing @xmath162 while decreasing or increasing our corresponding mass scales .",
    "indeed , we see that the variable @xmath238 allows us to interpolate between two extremes : traditional ensembles with high mass scales at large @xmath238 versus ddm - like ensembles with smaller mass scales at small @xmath238 .",
    "we further observe that for sufficiently small @xmath238 , the largest pie slice is no longer the @xmath40 slice ( labelled ` 1 ' in each pie chart )  as @xmath238 decreases , this honor gradually shifts towards the pie slices corresponding to higher mass levels .",
    "this is in accordance with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "[ fig10 ] is similar to the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , except that we have now increased our values of @xmath38 and @xmath37 to @xmath325 and @xmath326 , respectively .",
    "these new values maintain @xmath65 and correspond to the @xmath327 scalar string .",
    "these changes in @xmath38 and @xmath37 increase the degeneracies @xmath34 of states at each mass level , with the new values indicated within the corresponding pie slices .",
    "although the cosmological abundances per state are not affected by the changes in @xmath38 and @xmath37 , these increased degeneracies result in ensembles which are even more ddm - like and which have correspondingly smaller mass scales than those along the top row of fig .",
    "these results are consistent with those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "we see , then , that a tremendous variety of ddm ensembles exist which have the two fundamental features outlined in the introduction  regge trajectories and exponentially rising degeneracies of states .",
    "these ensembles are consistent with our look - back and @xmath253 constraints , and thus satisfy the zeroth - order constraints that may be imposed on such ensembles on the basis of their total energy densities and equations of state alone .",
    "we also observe an important feature , a inverse correlation between the tower fraction @xmath162 ( which governs the extent to which our ensemble is truly ddm - like ) and the magnitude of its underlying mass scales . indeed",
    ", we have seen that while traditional ensembles typically have high corresponding mass scales , our ensembles become increasingly ddm - like for lower mass scales  all while remaining consistent with our look - back and @xmath253 constraints .",
    "these observations will likely be an important guide and ingredient in any future attempts to build realistic dark - matter models of this type .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the properties of a hitherto - unexplored class of ddm ensembles whose constituents are the composite states which emerge in the confining phase of a strongly - coupled dark sector . in ensembles of this sort , the masses of the constituent particles lie along well - defined regge trajectories and the density of states within the ensemble grows exponentially as a function of the constituent - particle mass .",
    "this exponential growth is ultimately compensated by a boltzmann suppression factor in the primordial abundances of the individual constituents , resulting in a finite total energy density @xmath268 .",
    "we also showed that such ensembles can naturally exhibit a balancing between lifetimes and cosmological abundances of the sort required by the ddm framework .    for each such ensemble , we calculated the corresponding effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath11 as well as the tower fraction @xmath10 .",
    "we also imposed a number of zeroth - order model - independent phenomenological constraints which follow directly from knowledge of @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 .",
    "in general , we found that the imposition of such constraints tends to introduce _ correlations _ between the different underlying variables which parametrize our ddm ensembles , so that an increase in one variable ( such as , , the exponential rate of growth in the state degeneracies ) requires a corresponding shift in another variable ( in this case , an increase in the lifetime of the lightest state in the ensemble , as indicated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "perhaps one of our most important results is the existence of an inverse correlation between the tower fraction @xmath10 associated with a given a ddm ensemble and its corresponding fundamental mass scales , so that the present - day cosmological abundance of the dark sector must be distributed across an increasing number of different states in the ensemble as these fundamental mass scales are dialed from the planck scale down to the gev scale .",
    "we are certainly not the first to consider dark - matter scenarios in which the dark matter is composite .",
    "indeed , within the context of traditional dark - matter models , it has been appreciated for some time that the dark - matter particle could be a composite state .",

    "in such models , a dark - sector equivalent of bbn serves as the mechanism for abundance generation .",
    "such models can have interesting phenomenological consequences , especially in the regime in which a significant fraction of the dark - matter abundance is contributed by nuclei with large nucleon numbers  @xcite .",
    "composite dark - matter models are interesting from a phenomenological perspective as well .",

    "indeed , a number of explicit models along these lines have been constructed  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting ramifications of simp models is that they naturally give rise to dark - matter self - interactions with cross - sections sufficiently large that dark - matter scattering can have an observable impact on structure formation  @xcite .",
    "such composite dark - matter models can have other phenomenological consequences as well , both at indirect - detection experiments  @xcite and at colliders  @xcite .",
    "finally , the presence of additional non - abelian gauge sectors , each with their own analogue of the qcd @xmath333-angle , could have potential implications for the physics of axions and axion - like particles  @xcite .",
    "while all of these represent theoretically viable possibilities for the dark sector , the dark ensemble we have considered in this paper is unique for several important reasons . in traditional composite dark - matter models ,",
    "it is usually a single bound state ( usually the lightest bound state ) which serves as the primary dark - matter candidate and which therefore carries the full dark - matter abundance @xmath334 . while there may be several other dark states to which this bound state couples  and which may play a role in determining the abundance of the dark - matter candidate",
    " it is nevertheless true that only one ( or a few ) composite states carry the dark - matter abundance @xmath334 and thereby play a significant role in dark - sector phenomenology .",
    "by contrast , within the ddm framework , the dark - matter abundance is potentially spread across a relatively large set of composite states with various masses and lifetimes .",
    "thus the usual required stability of the traditional dark - matter candidate is not a required feature of the ddm ensemble , thereby allowing the associated dark - matter abundance @xmath335 and dark - matter equation - of - state parameter @xmath11 to vary with time  even during the current , matter - dominated era .",
    "moreover , because the ddm framework requires an enlarged viewpoint in which the entire spectrum of composite states are potentially relevant for determining the properties of the dark sector , features that describe the entire composite spectrum suddenly become relevant for determining dark - sector phenomenology  features which would not have been relevant for previous studies within more traditional frameworks .",
    "these features include the fact that the masses of such bound states actually lie along regge trajectories , and that the densities of such bound states experience a hagedorn - like exponential growth as a function of mass . indeed , these features do not play a role within traditional studies of composite dark states , but they have been the cornerstones of the analysis we have presented here . in this context , we note that a similar approach was also adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite with regard to ensembles of dark nuclei whose abundances are generated via a dark - sector analogue of bbn .",
    "this is indeed another context in which the full ensemble of dark - sector states plays an important role in dark - matter phenomenology .",

    "( [ eq : omeganprimordial ] ) , as well as our implicit assumption that the hubble expansion within which our calculations have taken place is unaffected by potential gravitational backreaction from our continually evolving dark sector .",
    "while these approximations may certainly be justified to first order , a more refined calculation is still capable of altering our results numerically if not qualitatively",
    ".    it would also be interesting to subject the ddm ensembles we have studied here to more detailed phenomenological constraints .",
    "the constraints we have studied here , such as our look - back and @xmath253 constraints , are those that follow directly ( and in a completely model - independent manner ) from knowledge of @xmath9 and @xmath11 alone , and as such we have seen that they are sufficient to rule out vast regions of parameter space .",
    "it is nevertheless true that a plethora of additional constraints could be formulated once a particular scenario with a particular particle content is specified , and that imposing such additional constraints could potentially narrow our viable parameter space still further .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , in this paper we have assumed that the effects of _ intra - ensemble _ decays on the decay widths of the ensemble constituents are negligible .",
    "such an assumption is certainly consistent with our other assumptions about the structure of the theory .",
    "in general , following our string - based approach to understanding the dyamics of these bound - state flux tubes , we may regard the strength of the interactions among the different dark hadrons in our ddm model as being governed by an additional parameter , a so - called `` string coupling '' @xmath336 , which we have not yet specified but which does not impact any of the results we have presented thus far . in general , @xmath336 can be different from the coupling which governs the decays of our ensemble states to sm states and which is thus embedded within @xmath147 . in an actual string construction , the value of @xmath336",
    "is determined by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the dilaton field , but the dynamics that determines this vev is not well understood .",
    "in general , however , intra - ensemble decays will provide an additional contribution to the total decay widths @xmath144 , especially for the heavier ensemble constituents , and the decays of these heavier constituents can serve as an additional source for the abundances of the lighter constituents .",
    "the effects of such intra - ensemble decays will be discussed in more detail in ref .",

    "<S> dynamical dark matter ( ddm ) is an alternative framework for dark - matter physics in which the dark sector comprises a vast ensemble of particle species whose standard - model decay widths are balanced against their cosmological abundances . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of this framework have focused on a particular class of ddm ensembles  motivated primarily by kaluza - klein towers in theories with extra dimensions  in which the density of dark states scales roughly as a polynomial of the mass . in this paper , by contrast , we study the properties of a different class of ddm ensembles in which the density of dark states grows _ exponentially _ with mass . ensembles with this hagedorn - like property arise naturally as the `` hadronic '' resonances associated with the confining phase of a strongly - coupled dark sector ; they also arise naturally as the gauge - neutral bulk states of type  i string theories . </S>",
    "<S> we study the dynamical properties of such ensembles , and demonstrate that an appropriate ddm - like balancing between decay widths and abundances can emerge naturally  even with an exponentially rising density of states . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effective equations of state for such ensembles , and investigate some of the model - independent observational constraints on such ensembles that follow directly from these equations of state . in general </S>",
    "<S> , we find that such constraints tend to introduce correlations between various properties of these ddm ensembles such as their associated mass scales , lifetimes , and abundance distributions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we find that these constraints allow ddm ensembles with energy scales ranging from the gev scale all the way to the planck scale , but that the total present - day cosmological abundance of the dark sector must be spread across an increasing number of different states in the ensemble as these energy scales are dialed from the planck scale down to the gev scale . numerous other correlations and constraints are also discussed .    </S>",
