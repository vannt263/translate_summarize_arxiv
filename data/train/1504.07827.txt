    "the importance of magnets for modern society can hardly be overstated ; they enter into every walk of life from medical equipment to transport ( trains , planes , cars ) to electronic appliances ( from household use to computers ) .",
    "all these devices use what is known as hard magnets .",
    "the most common examples of such hard magnets are nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b , smco@xmath2 and sm@xmath0co@xmath3 .",
    "these materials are the strongest permanent magnets known to date .",
    "rare - earths are , however , expensive and extracting them from mined ore is an highly polluting process .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to find a new generation of hard magnets that contain less or no rare - earth atoms@xcite .",
    "the first natural question to ask for designing new hard magnets is `` what makes the existing permanent magnets hard from a microscopic point of view ? '' for a magnet to be useful it needs to have two qualities ( a ) large saturation magnetization density ( ms ) and ( b ) a large magneto - crystalline anisotropy ( mca ) . a large mca is needed to make a magnet stable w.r.t external influences such as magnetic fields .",
    "the large magnetization density in these rare - earth magnets is provided by the ferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic atoms ( like fe , co or sm ) , while the large mca is due to both to the low symmetry of the crystal structure and the large spin - orbit coupling provided by the localized @xmath4-electrons . in order to design",
    "rare - earth free hard magnets one needs primarily to rely on low symmetry of the crystal structure to achieve large mca since the spin - orbit coupling is considerably smaller in @xmath5-electron materials .",
    "there exist several strategies to design new hard magnets ; in the present work we explore a novel idea : step 1 .",
    "identify two existing binary compounds with desirable magnetic properties ( with large ms and crystallizing in structures with high mca ) ; step 2 .",
    "stack these compounds together to form super - structures leading to further enhancement in the mca ; and finally step 3 . identifying the expensive component of this stack and attempt to reduce it .",
    "this combination of the two binaries reminds one of the quaternary heuslers of the type xxyz where atoms x , x and y are @xmath5-elements , the atom z is a @xmath6-element with metallic character@xcite .",
    "quaternary heusler structures are mainly investigated as half - metallic ferromagnets@xcite and are yet to be investigated from the viewpoint of hard magnetic materials .    in the present work",
    "we explore this strategy by identifying fept and mnal ( or mnga ) as the binary compounds .",
    "these materials have l1@xmath7 structure with large mca@xcite",
    ". the minimum energy and structures close - by for the stacks of these l1@xmath7 magnets are then explored for ferromagnetically coupled materials with large ms .",
    "the most expensive component of these compounds is pt .",
    "we then look for possible ways to reduce or replace pt in the stacks .",
    "structural optimization for all materials was performed using the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) with paw pseudopotential method@xcite using pbe exchange - correlation potential@xcite .",
    "the energy cutoff of 350 ev and a monkhorst - pack 10x10x10 k - point grid was used for all calculations .",
    "the possible magnetic phase space for a given structure was explored using the highly accurate all - electron full - potential linearized augmented - plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method as implemented within the elk code@xcite .",
    "as a first step we look at possible structures for compounds feptmnal and feptmnga : ( a ) three quaternary heusler structures@xcite based on the different positions of the four atoms ( see table [ table1 ] for details ) ( b ) two stacked l1@xmath7 structures ( which we call 2xl1@xmath7 in the rest of the paper ) .",
    "these two structures are ( see fig .",
    "[ 2xl10 ] ) built from four different layers stacked in different order : in structure 1 each magnetic layer is separated by a non - magnetic layer , while in structure 2 magnetic layers are nearest neighbors .",
    "these two 2xl1@xmath7 structures are stoichiometrically identical to the quaternary heusler structures .",
    ".three different types of atomic arrangement in the quaternary heusler compound xxyz with the space group @xmath8-@xmath9 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table4 ]",
    "we presented a novel approach for designing new hard magnets using stacks of existing binary magnets .",
    "such stacks could lead to high magneto crystalline anisotropy owing to the lowering of crystal symmetry .",
    "we explored this strategy using examples of fept , mnal and mnga .",
    "we further tried to reduce the expensive constituent of these stacks , i.e. pt , by changing the stoichiometry or by replacing pt with a less expensive metal . in doing",
    "so we identified two possible candidates namely fept@xmath0mnal@xmath0 and feal@xmath0mnal@xmath0 .",
    "we suggest that these materials could be found experimentally and merit further theoretical exploration .",
    "this work has been funded by the joint initiative for research and innovation within the fraunhofer and max planck cooperation program .",
