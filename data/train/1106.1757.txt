    "the problem of energy localization in discrete nonlinear hamiltonian systems attracts a considerable attention over the past few decades . in the framework of this problem",
    "a particular interest represent stationary discrete breathers ( dbs )  spatially localized and time - periodic dynamical objects .",
    "the history of discovery and discussion of different discrete breather properties can be found in a number of detailed review papers @xcite .",
    "various analytical , numerical and experimental methods were used to study breathers in a wide variety of discrete hamiltonian systems .",
    "however , the most papers on discrete breathers deal with one - dimensional chains , and much smaller number of articles are devoted to study these dynamical objects in 2d and 3d periodic structures @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we discuss discrete breathers in 2d square lattice with one degree of freedom per lattice site .",
    "such dynamical models are called _",
    "scalar_.    different physical interpretation can be given to a scalar model .",
    "for example , it has been used for describing transversal mechanical vibrations of plane lattice in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , charge vibrations in an electrical network of nonlinear capacitors coupled to each other with linear inductors in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , etc .",
    "[ fig01 ]        [ fig02 ]    in vector models , more than one degree of freedom is associated with every lattice cite .",
    "for example , one can consider mechanical vibrations of the plane lattice with @xmath2- and @xmath3-displacements of the particles along its surface .",
    "in many papers dbs in 2d and 3d lattices are investigated by some approximate methods such as `` rotating wave approximation '' ( rwa ) etc . , and only several works are devoted to study these dynamical objects with the aid of numerically exact procedures . for example , in the paper @xcite",
    ", stationary dbs were constructed for scalar models on square and hexagonal lattices with homogeneous interparticle potentials of different even degrees .    in the present paper",
    ", we develop a general group - theoretical method to obtain _ invariant manifolds _ admitting existence of localized excitations .",
    "then the search of dbs can be done in two steps .",
    "\\1 . singling out the above",
    "mentioned symmetry - determined invariant manifolds . to this end",
    ", we must know only the structure and the symmetry group of the considered physical system and we do nt take into account any information about interparticle interactions .",
    "constructing time - periodic dynamical regimes on each of these manifolds .",
    "obviously such regimes represent stationary discrete breathers .",
    "unlike the first step , we now need to know differential equations describing a given dynamical model .",
    "below we discuss the above approach using as examples the following two scalar dynamical models on the square lattice :    @xmath4    @xmath5    for both models @xmath6 , @xmath7 and periodic boundary conditions are assumed . in equilibrium state",
    "all @xmath8 are equal to zero . despite the fact that the dynamical variable @xmath8 associated with the site @xmath9 can be of different physical nature",
    ", we often refer to it as the particle ( atomic ) displacement .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) describe dynamical model on square lattice whose `` particles '' interact with the nearest neighbours and with a substrate by homogeneous intersite and on - site potentials of the same degree @xmath10 .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) determine the klein - gordon model , i.e. they describe an array of duffing oscillators with linear interaction between the nearest neighbours . in both models ,",
    "the strength of the on - site potential relative to the intersite potential is characterized by the coefficient @xmath11 , and we study stability of discrete breathers with respect to this parameter .    note that the model ( [ eq1 ] ) was used in @xcite without the on - site potential ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "why we consider these two models ?",
    "the model ( [ eq1 ] ) does not admit the harmonic approximation for @xmath13 , and therefore it has no phonon spectrum . on the other hand , there exist exact solutions to this model representing rosenberg nonlinear normal modes ( nnms ) @xcite ( see , also , @xcite ) . existence of such solutions is guaranteed by the possibility to separate space and time variables as a consequence of homogeneity of the potential . in the dynamical regime",
    "corresponding to a given rosenberg nnm , variables turn out to be proportional to one and the same function of time @xmath14 , while spatial profile can be determined from a system of nonlinear _ algebraic _ equations .",
    "each localized nnm represents a stationary discrete breather .",
    "moreover , linear stability of these modes can be analyzed much simpler than the investigation based on the well - known floquet method which one has to exploit in general case .",
    "the second model possesses phonon spectrum and turns out to be more complicated for studying .",
    "indeed , we must solve nonlinear _ differential _ equations to construct discrete breathers and need in the floquet method to analyze their stability .",
    "it is essential that for both models we search breather solutions on the _ same symmetry - determined invariant manifolds _ which are singled out by group - theoretical methods .",
    "the above invariant manifolds can be used to construct dbs for any other scalar models on the square lattice .    for vector models and/or for different lattices",
    ", one can find the corresponding symmetry - determined invariant manifolds using the same group - theoretical approach .",
    "let us emphasize that nonlinear differential equations of 2d and 3d dynamical models possess , as a rule , many different solutions and a symmetry - related classification is very desirable for any procedure of their construction",
    ".    among solutions which can exist on the symmetry - determined invariant manifolds discussed in the present paper may be not only dbs , but various localized _ quasiperiodic _ dynamical objects ( some discussion of such objects in one - dimensional lattices can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the stability analysis of quasiperiodic regimes represents serious difficulties since one can not use the floquet method in such cases .    in @xcite , we have developed a group - theoretical method for splitting the linearized dynamical equations near a given dynamical regime ( periodic or quasiperiodic ) with an arbitrary symmetry group . in some cases ,",
    "this method allows one to simplify considerably the stability studying of a given dynamical regime , since high - dimensional linearized system is decomposed into a number of _ independent _ subsystems of linear equations with time - dependent coefficients whose dimensions can be sufficiently small .",
    "the present paper possesses the following structure . the group - theoretical method for finding symmetry - determined invariant manifolds",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "discrete breathers in scalar model ( [ eq1 ] ) with homogeneous potentials of @xmath15 degrees are considered in sec .",

    "construction and stability of dbs in the klein - gordon model 2 are discussed in sec .",
    "the group - theoretical method for simplifying stability analysis of periodic and quasiperiodic regimes in dynamical systems with discrete symmetry is presented in sec .",
    "the results of the paper are briefly summarized in conclusion .",
    "[ sec1 ]      all possible solutions to a given system of differential equations @xmath16 can be classified by _ subgroups _",
    "@xmath17 of the `` parent '' symmetry group @xmath18 consisting of all transformations of dynamical variables which transform this system to its equivalent form . in other worlds , @xmath18 is the group of _ invariance _ of the considered dynamical model .",
    "in particular case of a hamiltonian system , @xmath18 can be treated as a group of all transformations under which its hamiltonian turns out to be invariant .",
    "if we take a certain solution to the dynamical equations @xmath16 and begin to act on it by all transformations @xmath19 , then some of these transformations conserve the solution  they form a subgroup @xmath20 . on the other hand , acting on the above solution by other @xmath19 , i.e. by @xmath21 , we obtain the _ orbit _ of @xmath10 exact solutions to which our original solution belongs .",
    "the integer number @xmath10 is the _ index _ of the subgroup @xmath17 in the group @xmath18 .",
    "thus , for the symmetry classification of all possible dynamical regimes in the given model with parent group @xmath18 , we must consider all its subgroups @xmath22 .",
    "each @xmath17 determines an _ invariant manifold _ in the phase space of the dynamical system : if we select initial conditions belonging to this manifold and begin to integrate the differential equations of our model , we obtain a dynamical regime which never leaves the above manifold during the time evolution .",
    "invariant manifolds corresponding to subgroups of the symmetry group of a given model we call `` symmetry - determined invariant manifolds '' .    the idea of classification of dynamical regimes by symmetry - determined invariant manifolds was taken as a principle in the theory of _ bushes of nonlinear normal modes _ in physical systems with discrete symmetry @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a given @xmath10-dimensional bush is described by @xmath10 dynamical variables and represents an _ exact _ solution belonging to a certain symmetry - determined invariant manifold of the considered dynamical model .    in @xcite",
    ", we have obtained low - dimensional bushes of extended vibrational modes for dynamical models on various space - periodic structures .",
    "for example , in @xcite this has been done for all possible 3d crystal structures described by any of 230 space groups .",
    "we have studied existence and stability of one - dimensional and two - dimensional bushes of nnms in the fpu chains in @xcite .",
    "the group - theoretical approach for finding bushes of nnms and for analyzing their stability properties was described in detail in @xcite . however , up to the present time , we applied this approach to study bush existence and stability for the case of _ extended _ nnms . for this purpose",
    ", we need to make use of the subgroups @xmath17 of the parent space group @xmath18 which include some _ translational _ symmetry elements .",
    "the primitive cell of the resulting spatial pattern of the vibrational state is some times greater than the primitive cell of the equilibrium state .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider stationary discrete breathers which represent _ localized _ vibrational regimes . as a consequence",
    ", they are associated with _",
    "subgroups of the corresponding parent space group .      to begin the procedure of finding symmetry - determined invariant manifolds",
    ", we must choose a parent symmetry group @xmath18 which embraces all transformations of dynamical variables under which the considered mathematical model is invariant .",
    "taking into account that the stationary state represents one of the solutions to the model dynamical equations and that , therefore , the symmetry of this state must be a certain subgroup of @xmath18 , we , firstly , consider the spatial transformations under which the square lattice is invariant .",
    "it is well known , that the symmetry of square lattice is characterized by the plane space group @xmath23 ( in schoenflies and in the international notations , respectively ) and we can assume @xmath24 .    in general",
    ", the parent group @xmath18 can be wider than the symmetry group of the stationary state .",
    "for example , several stationary states with the same energy and symmetry can correspond to a given hamiltonian system and , as a consequence , the symmetry elements which transform these stationary states into each other must also enter the group @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the parent group @xmath18 can contain some additional symmetry elements due to the specific type of interparticle interactions in the considered model . for both models ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq21 ] ) ,",
    "all forces acting on particles turn out to be _ odd _ functions of the atomic displacements @xmath25 ( the corresponding potentials represent even functions of their arguments ) . as a consequence",
    ", changing signs of all dynamical variables , which we denote by symbol @xmath26 , also represents a transformation under which models ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq21 ] ) are invariant and @xmath26 must be incorporated into the parent group @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , in our case , the symmetry parent group @xmath18 can be written as the direct product of the space group @xmath27 and the group(@xmath28 , @xmath26 ) : @xmath29 the last group consists of two elements , @xmath28 and @xmath26 , where @xmath28 is identity element .",

    "it such a case , we will obtain more detailed symmetry - related classification of the dynamical regimes because some more subgroups correspond to the wider parent group .",

    "wps determine points in the crystalline lattice with different _ local _ symmetry and , in any crystal , atoms are distributed among these points .",
