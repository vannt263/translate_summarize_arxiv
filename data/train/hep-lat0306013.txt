    "i have been asked by the organizers to review the status of lattice qcd calculations at non - zero temperature with three quark flavours .",
    "the exciting news here is that due to improvements in algorithms , we are now able to carry out calculations with light up and down quarks considerably lighter than the strange quark . before presenting results",
    ", i give a brief introduction to lattice calculations , and then i will outline how algorithms have been improved . after presenting numerical results , i will discuss briefly the recent significant advances in dealing with finite chemical potential .",
    "( i ran out of time during my talk and did not discuss this at the conference . )",
    "to carry out a lattice simulation we must select certain parameters , namely the lattice spacing ( @xmath0 ) or gauge coupling ( @xmath1 ) , a fixed grid size ( @xmath2 ) where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the space and time dimensions of the grid , respectively , and quark masses ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "there are also certain parameters related to the algorithm .",
    "the parameters detailed have physical meaning , and each choice can lead to a systematic error that must be controlled .    to deal with the non - zero lattice spacing",
    ", we must take the continuum limit .",
    "similarly , we must take the infinite volume limit to deal with the finite fixed grid .",
    "finally , we must extrapolate to light quark mass for the up and down quarks .",
    "this is a practical issue as it is too expensive to do the calculations with the physical up and down masses . on the other hand",
    ", we can work at the physical @xmath7 quark mass .",
    "for finite temperature calculations , the temperature is given by @xmath8 , so we use grids with @xmath9 .",
    "typically , @xmath3 is two or three times @xmath4 to provide a reasonably large physical volume .    also of physical relevance ( especially for the rhic program )",
    "is nonzero chemical potential @xmath10 . until recently ,",
    "it has been nearly impossible to carry out calculations with @xmath11 .",
    "the first numerical lattice calculations used the wilson ( plaquette ) gauge action and either wilson or kogut - susskind ( ks or staggered ) quark actions .",
    "the wilson quark action is designed to solve the fermion `` doubling '' problem .",
    "so is the ks approach ; however , it maintains enough degrees of freedom for four quark fields .",
    "there remains a @xmath12 chiral symmetry and a single goldstone pion .",
    "the rest of the flavour symmetry is broken for non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "thus , the other pion states are heavier than the goldstone state because of flavour ( or what is now frequently called taste ) symmetry breaking .    starting in the mid-1980s ,",
    "the symanzik improvement program @xcite began to be applied to calculations to improve the scaling properties of the theory . for wilson type",
    "quarks the improvement called clover quarks was introduced by sheikholeslami and wohlert @xcite .",
    "naik introduced a new three link term for ks quarks in 1989 @xcite .",
    "an improved gauge action was applied in 1995 @xcite .",
    "soon thereafter calculations were done with the naik term and an improved gauge action @xcite and the importance of `` fattening '' the action to reduce taste symmetry breaking was tested and understood [ 610 ] . about the same time , the p4 action was introduced because of it s improved rotational symmetry @xcite all of these improvement schemes are analagous to higher order methods in numerical analysis , but with the twist of applying to qft .",
    "they exact a computational toll from having a more complicated action , but they more than make up for that by reducing systematic errors and allowing a larger lattice spacing to be used . since computational requirement goes like a large power ( 79 ) of the inverse lattice spacing , it really reduces the cost to use a larger lattice spacing .",
    "more recently , domain wall fermions and the overlap method were developed to better control chiral symmetry .",
    "they are not yet extensively used for thermodynamics , but see reference @xcite .",
    "we shall concentrate on the improvement program for staggered quarks .",

    "due to lack of time , this material was not presented in my talk .",
    "that was unfortunate , because very significant progress has been made in algorithms , and we can expect to see concomitant advances in calculations soon .",
    "calculations with finite chemical potential are important because experiments at heavy - ion colliders such a rhic start with nuclei , not anti - nuclei so there is a quark chemical potential @xmath10 of about 15 mev @xcite . however , finite chemical potential is difficult because the action is no longer real so it is no longer possible to implement importance sampling in the usual way .",
    "recent progress has been made using three new methods .",
    "fodor and katz introduced a multiparameter reweighting technique @xcite .",
    "the key here is that the gauge coupling is shifted from @xmath1 to @xmath24 in order to maximize the overlap of the ensemble generated with @xmath25 with the desired @xmath11 ensemble .",

    "thus , reweighting is avoided but the chemical potential must be small as only the leading order term is available .",
    "de forcrand and philipsen use analytic continuation from imaginary @xmath10 @xcite . when the chemical potential is imaginary , the action is real and importance sampling works . the challenge is to do the analytic continuation",
    ". it will be interesting to see which of these approaches is best .",
    "we are certainly learning more about qcd with @xmath11 than we had previously been able to .",
    "i hope i have convinced you that there are _ many _ interesting calculations being done at finite temperature with @xmath28 and 3 .",
    "however , a great deal remains to be done : we need better control of systematic errors , including the continuum limit and wider coverage of the phase diagram .",
    "i have concentrated on results with improved ks type quarks , but these are not the only methods for quarks .",
    "for example , improved actions for clover quarks are being pursued by the cp - pacs / jlqcd collaborations @xcite .",
    "dynamical quark calculations with domain wall or overlap quarks and calculations with chemical potential are just in their infancy .",
    "although we lattice practitioners have learned a great deal recently , there is much we can and _ shall _ do to improve our calculations .",

    "i would like to thank all my milc collaborators , especially urs heller and bob sugar for reading this manuscript .",
