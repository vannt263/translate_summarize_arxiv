    "equations of state ( eos s ) of hot and dense matter play an important role in the dynamics of core collapse supernovae both at sub- and supra - nuclear densities ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "not only thermodynamical quantities such as pressure , internal energy , entropy , sound velocity but also information on matter composition is provided by eos . at sub - nuclear densities ,",
    "the latter affects the rates of electron captures and coherent neutrino scatterings on nuclei , both of which in turn determine the electron fraction of collapsing cores , one of the most critical ingredients for the core dynamics .",
    "this is exactly the issue we would like to address in this paper .",
    "the eos employed for the core collapse simulation must cover a wide range of density ( @xmath1 ) and temperature ( @xmath2k ) , including both neutron - rich and proton - rich matter .",
    "one of the difficulties in constructing the eos originates from the fact that depending on the density , temperature and proton fraction , the matter consists of either dilute free nucleons or a mixture of an ensemble of nuclei and free nucleons or strongly interacting dense nucleons .",
    "another complication is the existence of the so - called nuclear pasta phase , in which nuclear shapes change from droplet to rod to slab to anti - rod and bubble(anti - droplet ) as the density increases toward the nuclear saturation density , at which uniform nuclear matter is realized @xcite . at high temperatures ( @xmath3k )",
    ", chemical equilibrium is achieved for all strong and electromagnetic reactions , which is referred to as nuclear statistical equilibrium , or nse , and the nuclear composition in the matter is determined as a function of density , temperature and proton fraction.@xcite at lower temperatures , the matter composition is an outcome of preceding nuclear burnings and can not be obtained by statistical mechanics . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the high temperature regime , in which the nuclear composition is a part of eos .    at present , there are only two eos s in wide use for the core - collapse simulation .",
    "the lattimer - swesty s eos  @xcite is based on skyrme - type nuclear interactions and the so - called compressible liquid drop model for nuclei surrounded by dripped nucleons .",
    "the eos by h. shen , toki , oyamatsu and sumiyoshi  @xcite employs a relativistic mean field theory ( rmf ) to describe nuclear matter and the thomas - fermi approximation for finite nuclei with dripped nucleons .",
    "it should be emphasized here that both eos s adopt the so - called single nucleus approximation ( sna ) , in which only a single representative nucleus is included .",
    "in other words , the distribution of nuclei is ignored .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that sna is not a bad approximation for thermodynamical quantities such as pressure .",
    "it will not be the case , however , for the weak interaction rates , since the electron capture rates are sensitive to nuclear shell structures and the greatest contributor is not the most abundant nuclei that the single representative nuclei in sna are supposed to approximate @xcite .",
    "it is also noted that the coherent scattering of neutrinos on nuclei has a cross section proportional to @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the nuclear mass number . in sna",
    "we have no information on the average of mass number squared @xmath6 and replace it by @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the mass number of the representative nucleus .",
    "this is certainly an approximation that needs justification .",
    "recently @xcite published a new eos at sub - nuclear densities meant for the use in supernova simulations .",
    "assuming nse , they calculated the abundances of nuclei as a function of density , temperature and proton fraction , minimizing the model free energy .",
    "they employed rmf for the nucleon contribution and adopted masses of nuclei from two mass tables in public domain .",
    "one of them is the experimental atomic mass table 2003 @xcite and the other is a tabulated theoretical prediction for nuclei with no available experimental data , which is based on rmf @xcite with the tma parameter set @xcite .",
    "the translational and coulomb energies of nuclei are designed so that the free energy could match the one given by rmf for uniform nuclear matter at the saturation density .",
    "it should be noted that the solution of the saha equation for the mass data , which are obtained in laboratory @xcite or calculated for isolated nuclei @xcite , is not appropriate at high densities ( @xmath9g/@xmath10 ) , since nuclei are not isolated and affected by surrounding other nuclei , nucleons and electrons , resulting in the modification of masses of nuclei .",
    "our formulation is quite similar to the one employed by @xcite .",
    "the major difference , however , is that we calculate very heavy nuclei ( @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the atomic number ) with a mass formula whereas @xcite ignored these nuclei owing to the limitation of the mass tables .",
    "it is stressed , however , that these massive nuclei do appear in the h. shen s eos @xcite and , as shown later , they are indeed abundant at high densities ( @xmath13 ) in our eos also . another important improvement in this paper is the treatment of the nuclear pasta phase , which was entirely ignored in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this is important to reproduce the conventional manner of transition to uniform nuclear matter , that is , nuclei do not melt down to nucleons but survive up to the nuclear saturation density .",
    "the aim of our project is in a sense to merge all the previous eos s to provide all the information needed for core collapse simulations : thermodynamical quantities such as pressure , internal energy , entropy , sound velocity and some other important derivatives as well as information on the abundance of nuclei required for the calculation of the weak interaction rates ; the description of uniform nuclear matter is based on rmf in h. shen s eos ; the approximate treatment of the pasta phase is similar to the one employed in lattimer - swesty s eos ; we solve a saha - like equation to obtain the abundance of nuclei . in this paper",
    ", we describe the formulation in detail and show some features of our eos , which are particularly different from those of the previous eos s . more systematic and thorough presentation of the eos will be given in the sequel after we have constructed the eos table that includes somehow the electron capture rates .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we explain in detail the model free energy to be minimized .",
    "then the results of minimization are shown in section 3 , with an emphasis being put on the comparison with the previous eos s .",
    "the paper is wrapped up with a summary and some discussions in section  4 .",
    "the strategy to obtain the multi - component eos is to construct a model free energy and minimize it with respect to the parameters involved in the expression of the free energy .",
    "the matter in the supernova core at sub - nuclear densities consists of nucleons , nuclei together with electrons and photons .",
    "the latter two are not treated in this paper although the inclusion of them as ideal fermi and bose gases respectively are quite simple and now a routine .",
    "neutrinos are not always in thermal or chemical equilibrium with the matter and can not be included in the eos .",
    "their non - equilibrium distributions should be computed by the transport equations .",
    "the free energy is thus a sum of the contributions from the individual nucleus and those from the nucleons that are not contained in the nuclei .",
    "we employ the rmf free energy for the nucleons outside the nuclei . in constructing the model free energy for the nuclei ,",
    "the following points are appropriately taken into account :    1 .",
    "not only the nuclei that are known to exist in laboratory but exotic ones such as very neutron - rich and/or very heavy nuclei should be also included somehow even if experimental data are unavailable .",
    "they are indeed obtained in supernova simulations with eos s that employ sna .",
    "[ req1 ] 2 .   at low densities ,",
    "experimental mass data should be used whenever available .",
    "this is important to guarantee that the most stable iron group nuclei are populated with correct abundances at low temperatures .",
    "[ req2 ] 3 .   at higher densities ,",
    "strong and electromagnetic interactions among free nucleons , nuclei and electrons can not be ignored and should be properly reflected in the surface and coulomb energies of nuclei .",
    "[ req3 ] 4 .",
    "the bulk energy of nuclei should approach the one for uniform nuclear matter as the density increases to the nuclear saturation density .",
    "this should be taken into consideration to obtain a continuous transition to uniform nuclear matter .",
    "[ req4 ] 5 .   near the nuclear saturation density",
    ", the nuclear pasta phase should be treated somehow .",
    "this is also a necessary ingredient to realize a seamless transition to uniform nuclear matter , in which nuclei are not dissociated to nucleons but continue to exist right up to the transition .",
    "[ req5 ]    the model free energy for nuclei described in detail in the following subsections is based on the mass formula .",
    "as mentioned above in point  [ req2 ] , at low densities , experimental mass data are utilized , whenever available , to obtain the bulk energy of nuclei and rmf is employed otherwise . at high densities , however , even for the nuclei , for which experimental data exist , the bulk energy is modified so that points  [ req3 ] and  [ req4 ] are satisfied .",
    "as for point  [ req5 ] , only the bubble phase is explicitly considered , following the phenomenological prescription adopted in @xcite . although it is easy to change it , we suppose in this paper that h. shen s eos is used for uniform nuclear matter at supra - nuclear densities .",
    "the continuous transition from the eos at sub - nuclear densities to the one at supra - nuclear densities is guaranteed by the following prescriptions : the free energy of the nucleons outside nuclei is based on the same rmf model as for uniform nuclear matter ; the bulk energy of nuclei is modified to approach that of uniform nuclear matter as the density increases ; the surface , coulomb and translational energies of nuclei go to zero as the transition density is approached .",
    "the details of these prescriptions will be given in the following subsections .",
    "we briefly explain the rmf model we employ for the nucleons in section  [ secnucleon ]",
    ". then we proceed to the description of the model free energy for nuclei in section  [ secnuclei ] , in which the coulomb and surface energies are treated in subsections  [ subsecc ] and  [ subsecs ] , respectively , the bulk energy is presented in subsection  [ subsecb ] and the translational energy is given in subsection  [ subsect ] .",
    "the method to minimize the model free energy is explained in section  [ secmin ] and the evaluation of thermodynamical quantities from the free energy is mentioned in section  [ secth ] .",
    "the free energy of the nucleons that are not contained in nuclei is base on rmf in this paper   @xcite .",
    "the choice is not essential , however , and one can replace it by any other theory or model indeed .",
    "the important thing to ensure the continuous transition to uniform nuclear matter is to use the same theory or model for the nucleons outside nuclei at sub - nuclear densities and uniform nuclear matter at supra - nuclear densities .",
    "the details of the rmf model employed in this paper can be found in the original paper   @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we summarize only the essential ingredients .    in rmf nuclear interactions",
    "are described by the exchange of mesons .",
    "the employed lagrangian is the following : @xmath14\\psi   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma -\\frac{1}{2}m^2_{\\sigma}\\sigma^2-\\frac{1}{3}g_{2}\\sigma^{3 } -\\frac{1}{4}g_{3}\\sigma^{4 } \\\\",

    "\\nonumber   & & -\\frac{1}{4}r^a_{\\mu\\nu}r^{a\\mu\\nu } + \\frac{1}{2}m^2_{\\rho}\\rho^a_{\\mu}\\rho^{a\\mu}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression , the notation is the same as in @xcite : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote nucleons ( proton and neutron ) , scalar - isoscalar meson , vector - isoscalar meson and vector - isovector meson , respectively , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the nucleon - meson interactions are given by the yukawa couplings and the isoscalar mesons ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) interact with themselves , which are expressed as the cubic and quartic terms . in the mean field theory ,",
    "the mesons are assumed to be classical and replaced by their ensemble averages whereas the dirac equation for nucleons is quantized and the free energy is evaluated based on the energy spectrum of nucleons obtained this way .",
    "@xmath21 is the mass of nucleons and assumed to be @xmath22mev .",
    "we use the tm1 parameter set as in @xcite , in which the masses of mesons , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the coupling constants , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , are determined so that not only the saturation of uniform nuclear matter but also the properties of finite nuclei could be best reproduced @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study how the resulting eos is affected by the choice of rmf parameter or , more generally , by the choice of eos for uniform nuclear matter .",
    "if the preceding paper  @xcite , in which several rmf parametrizations were compared , is any guide , differences in the rmf parametrization will be reflected in thermodynamic quantities near the saturation density .",
    "since rmf is employed also for the bulk energy of nuclei in our eos as explained later in subsection  [ subsecb ] , differences in symmetry energy originated from different parametrizations may be reflected in the neutron - richness of nuclei , for which we have no available experimental mass data and the empirical mass formula is employed . the abundance of nuclei with experimental mass data , on the other hand ,",
    "will not be changed very much .",
    "it should be also noted that rmf in general tends to overestimate the neutron matter energy at sub - nuclear densities  @xcite .",
    "it is stressed that one of the features of our eos is that it is easy to adopt different eos s at supra - nuclear densities as long as they are available .",
    "the above issues will be discussed more in detail in the forthcoming paper . in this paper ,",
    "the free energy density of uniform nuclear matter , @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 being the baryon number density , temperature and proton fraction , respectively , is used mainly at sub - nuclear densities . in so doing , one important thing to be taken into account",
    "is the fact that the free nucleons can not exist in the volume occupied by nuclei .",
    "the volume , @xmath36 , that can accommodate the nucleons is hence given by @xmath37 where index @xmath38 specifies a nucleus , @xmath39 is the total volume , @xmath40 is the particle number of nucleus @xmath38 and @xmath41 is the volume of nucleus @xmath38 , which is expressed by the mass number , @xmath42 , and number density , @xmath43 , of the same nucleus as well as the nuclear saturation density , @xmath44 , as follows : @xmath45 where we assume that the nuclei are homogeneous , having the nuclear saturation density , @xmath44 .",
    "the reason why @xmath44 has the subscript @xmath38 will be made clear later ( see section  [ secnuclei ] ) .",
    "then the densities of free protons and neutrons in the volume @xmath36 , which are denoted by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , are given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the particle numbers and the number densities in the total volume @xmath39 of nucleons and @xmath51 is expressed as @xmath52 .",
    "the free energy density for the nucleons in @xmath36 should be evaluated at @xmath53 and @xmath54 and is given for the entire volume as @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "this is the most crucial part of our model free energy and is described in detail in the following .",
    "the free energy of nuclei consists of two parts , one of which concerns a translational energy whereas the other part is roughly a nuclear mass .",
    "the modeling of the latter is based on a semi - empirical mass formula and takes into account the coulomb , surface and bulk energies .",
    "we explain each contribution to the mass formula one by one and then move on to the treatment of the translational energy .    before proceeding , however , we state here the definition of the nuclear saturation density , @xmath57 , more precisely , since it will appear frequently in the following .",
    "it is in principle the baryon number density at which the free energy per baryon , @xmath58 with @xmath59 , by rmf takes its minimum value or , put another way , the uniform nuclear matter _ with the same proton fraction as the nucleus _ has the lowest energy in rmf .",
    "note that the proton fraction of each nuclei is different from the one for the whole system and that our nuclear saturation density is actually different from nucleus to nucleus and hence has the subscript that indicates which nucleus is referred to .",
    "there are two exceptions to this definition , though .",
    "the first one is the case , in which the saturation density given above is smaller than the number density of the whole system , @xmath33 .",
    "this happens if @xmath33 reaches the saturation density of some nucleus , @xmath57 , before the whole system becomes uniform .",
    "this is indeed possible because the saturation density tends to be smaller for more neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "in such a case the nucleus will be overcompressed and we replace the original saturation density with the number density of the whole system , @xmath33 .",
    "the second case occurs at high temperatures , for which the free energy , @xmath60 , has no minimum because the entropy contribution , the @xmath61 term with @xmath62 being entropy , overwhelms the internal energy . in that case the nuclear saturation density , @xmath44 , is set to be the density where the matter becomes uniform in the h. shen s eos .      to calculate the coulomb energy density in the free energy for nuclei",
    "we introduce a wigner - seitz cell ( w - s cell ) for each species of nuclei and impose charge neutrality in it .",
    "it is assumed that a nucleus is centered in the w - s cell , the volume of which is denoted as @xmath63 and that the cell contains also nucleons as a vapor outside the nucleus as well as electrons , which are assumed to be uniform in the entire cell .",
    "the charge neutrality in the cell can be expressed as @xmath64 which can be solved for @xmath63 and gives @xmath65 where @xmath41 is the nuclear volume in the cell and @xmath66 denotes the number density of electrons .",
    "the vapor volume and nuclear volume fraction for each nucleus are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "as the density approaches the nuclear saturation density , the nuclear pasta phase is encountered , in which various shapes of nuclei exist .",
    "as mentioned already , this phase has to be somehow treated in order to obtain the smooth transition to uniform nuclear matter .",
    "it is much beyond the scope of our project to treat all known pastas accurately , however .",
    "we hence resort to a rather crude approximation , in which the bubble phase is explicitly considered .",
    "it is known that bubble nuclei , in which the vapor nucleons are surrounded by the nucleus , appear at the end of the pasta phase .",
    "we assume there that a spherical vapor is located at the center of w - s cell surrounded by a shell - shaped nucleus .",
    "in this paper we assume further that each nucleus enters the nuclear pasta phase individually when the volume fraction , @xmath69 , reaches @xmath70 and that the bubble shape is realized when it exceeds @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the intermediate states ( @xmath72 ) are simply interpolated from the normal and bubble states .",
    "this criterion is admittedly rather arbitrary .",
    "we have tried another choice , @xmath73 , and confirmed that the results are hardly affected , though .",
    "we hence believe that our eos is not very sensitive to the criterion .",
    "the evaluation of the coulomb energy in the w - s cell is straightforward and given by the following expression : @xmath74 where the cell is assumed to be spherically symmetric and @xmath75 is the sum of electron and proton charges up to the radius @xmath76 .",
    "assuming further that the protons are uniformly distributed in the nucleus and the vapor separately , we obtain the coulomb energies for the normal and bubble phases from the above integration as follows : @xmath77 with @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the elementary charge .",
    "note that the two energies coincide with each other at @xmath80 , since the nuclear volume , @xmath41 , is equal to the vapor volume , @xmath81 , there although the value is not used and the interpolation is done from the values at @xmath82 and @xmath83 to take crudely into account the existence of other pastas .",
    "we employ cubic polynomials of @xmath69 for interpolation .",
    "the four coefficients of the polynomial are determined by the condition that the coulomb energy is continuous and smooth as a function of @xmath69 at @xmath82 and @xmath83 .      in the semi - empirical mass formula we employ in this paper ,",
    "the surface energy of nuclei is given by the product of the nuclear surface area and the surface tension , which is approximated by the following analytic expression : @xmath84,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the radius of nucleus @xmath38 and @xmath86 denotes the surface tension for symmetric nuclei .",
    "the second term on the right hand side is added to accommodate highly neutron - rich nuclei , for which no experimental data are available but a proper consideration of the surface symmetry energy is almost mandatory .",
    "the values of the constants , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , are adopted from the paper by @xcite .",
    "note that this expression gives negative values if nuclei become extremely neutron - rich .",
    "we hence assume in this paper that only those neutron - rich nuclei with a surface tension higher than a prescribed lower limit , @xmath89 , can exist .",
    "this value is obtained from the mass data of the most neutron - rich nuclei with @xmath90  @xcite and the subtraction of the bulk and coulomb energies given by our mass formula .",
    "noting that the nuclear surface should be replaced by the bubble surface in the bubble phase , we obtain the following expression for the surface energy : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the radius of bubble @xmath38 .",
    "the last factor , @xmath93 , in these expressions are introduced to take into account the effect that the surface energy should be reduced as the density contrast decreases between the nucleus and the nucleon vapor .",
    "the specific functional form is inspired by the surface energy employed in the thomas - fermi approximation in the h. shen s eos , @xmath94 ( eq .  ( 35 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "as shown later , this prescription is necessary to ensure the continuous transition to uniform nuclear matter , since the transition occurs not only by coalescence of nuclei but also by the increase in the density of nucleon vapor . for the other pastas ( @xmath95 ) , we employ the same cubic interpolation as for the coulomb energy ( section  [ subsecc ] ) .",
    "the bulk energy of nuclei should be different at high densities , @xmath9g/@xmath10 , from the one at lower densities , since nuclei can not be regarded as an isolated object and effects of other nuclei , nucleons and electrons can not be ignored @xcite . in this paper , we will take this into account phenomenologically as follows .",
    "as the density increases , the nuclear bulk energy , @xmath96 , should approach the one for uniform nuclear matter with the same proton fraction .",
    "we obtain the latter from rmf as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the free energy per baryon by rmf .",
    "note that the proton fraction in this expression is not the one for the whole system but the one for each nucleus ; the density is taken to be the saturation density defined earlier ( section  [ secnuclei ] ) for each nucleus .",
    "this implies that nuclei have their own densities that are different from each other .",
    "since the saturation density tends to be lower for neutron - rich nuclei , the density of the whole system becomes equal to the one for some neutron - rich nucleus one after another as it increases .",
    "in such a case the density of the nucleus that becomes uniform in its w - s cell is set to be the system density as mentioned earlier .",
    "these prescriptions ensure the continuous transition to uniform nuclear matter .    at low densities , on the other hand ,",
    "experimental mass data are used whenever available  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed important to reproduce the well - known results of the ordinary nse .",
    "as will be shown later , the nuclear shell and even - odd effects manifest themselves in the abundance of nuclei and should be taken into account whenever possible .",
    "these experimental mass data are accommodated in our mass formula by adjusting the bulk energy , which is expressed as @xmath99_{vacuum}-[e_i^{s}]_{vacuum } , \\label{eq : blkl}\\ ] ] where subtracted from the experimental mass , @xmath100 , are the coulomb and surface energies @xmath101_{vacuum}$ ] of the nucleus isolated in vacuum , that is , the energies calculated from our mass formula for @xmath102 .",
    "this ensures that the experimental mass is reproduced exactly in the low density limit . at finite densities , on the other hand ,",
    "the mass is given by @xmath103_{vacuum}-[e_i^{s}]_{vacuum}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the bulk energy in our mass formula actually includes other energies such as the bulk symmetry , shell and pair energies .",
    "for nuclei with no available experimental data , we employ the bulk energy obtained from rmf even at low densities as explained above .",
    "since these nuclei , which are either very heavy @xmath104 or highly neutron - rich @xmath105 , are abundant normally at high densities ( @xmath106 ) alone , the above prescription is justified .",
    "the only exception is the combination of very low temperatures ( @xmath107mev ) and low proton fractions ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "such cases are not encountered in the simulations of core - collapse supernovae , however , and will not be a problem practically , either . these low- and high - density values ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : blkl ] ) and ( [ eq : blkh ] ) ) are linearly interpolated between @xmath109 and the nuclear saturation density , @xmath110 .",
    "the linear interpolation makes the free energy not smooth and the pressure discontinuous at the boundaries of the interpolation region . in practice",
    ", however , the variation of the bulk energy is quite minor compared with those of coulomb and translational energies and the discontinuities of the pressure are negligible .",
    "moreover , nuclei that have experimental mass data and hence need the interpolation are not abundant near the high density end , the fact which makes the discontinuities even less important there .",
    "we hence believe that the above prescription is sufficient .      the translational energy of nucleus @xmath38 in our model free energy is based on that for the ideal boltzmann gas and given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath113 .",
    "since nuclei have internal degrees of freedom , the contribution from excited states of nuclei to the free energy can not be ignored at high temperatures . in the above formula , the effect is encapsulated in @xmath114 , which is approximated by @xcite as @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes the contribution of the ground - state ( the spin degrees of freedom and normally much smaller than @xmath117 ) and is set to be @xmath118 for even nuclei and @xmath119 for odd ones in this paper for simplicity .",
    "other coefficients in the contribution from the excited states are given as @xmath120mev@xmath121 , @xmath122mev@xmath121 and @xmath123 . in order to estimate the sensitivity of results to @xmath117",
    ", we multiplied the original @xmath117 rather arbitrarily by a factor of 0.5 or 2 at @xmath124 and @xmath125mev and compared the results .",
    "we found small differences at @xmath126g/@xmath10 .",
    "for example , the free energy is decreased or increased by 4% at most ; the entropy changes -1% and + 3% whereas the mass fraction of all nuclei varies -10% and + 8% from the original values .",
    "the last factor on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tra ] ) takes account of the excluded - volume effect : each nucleus can move in the space that is not occupied by other nuclei and free nucleons .",
    "the factor reduces the translational energy at high densities and is important to ensure the continuous transition to uniform nuclear matter as mentioned earlier . in reality , however , the nuclear translational energy is supposed to be suppressed by the formation of coulomb lattice when the so - called plasma factor , which is defined as @xmath127 with the average proton number @xmath128 and distance between nuclei @xmath129 , reaches a critical value @xmath130 @xcite and the introduced factor may be regarded as a very crude phenomenological approximation to this situation .",
    "the present form of the factor , @xmath131 , actually gives a linear suppression in terms of the occupied volume @xmath132 .",
    "here we always employ the nuclear saturation density for symmetric nuclei @xmath133 _ { z_i / a_i=0.5}$ ] for numerical convenience , which will be justified , provided the approximation itself is very crude .",
    "note also that the translational energy is a minor contribution except at low densities , where the factor is almost unity .",
    "the abundances of nuclei as a function of @xmath134 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are obtained by minimizing the model free energy derived so far with respect to the number densities of nuclei and nucleons under the constraints , @xmath135 just as in the ordinary nse calculations .",
    "note that @xmath50 is the number density of proton / neutron in the total volume @xmath39 of the system as defined in [ secnucleon ] . by introducing lagrange multipliers , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , for these constraints",
    ", the minimization condition is given by @xmath138 where@xmath139 is the free energy density , @xmath140 and the index @xmath141 runs over all nuclear species and nucleons .",
    "taking @xmath142 , we find as usual that the lagrange multipliers , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , are related to the chemical potentials of proton ( @xmath143 ) and neutron ( @xmath144 ) as @xmath145 the differentiation with respect to the number densities of nuclei , on the other hand , gives the usual relations between the chemical potentials of nuclei @xmath146 and those of proton and neutron : @xmath147    differentiating the free energy for nuclei with respective to the number densities of nuclei , @xmath43 , and employing eq .",
    "( [ eq : mun ] ) , we can express @xmath43 as follows : @xmath148 note that the only difference from the counter part in the ordinary nse calculations , @xmath149 seems to be the factor @xmath150 in the denominator in the exponential .",

    "for example , the entropy per baryon in our eos is larger than that in the h. shen s eos at @xmath200g/@xmath10 and @xmath201mev owing to larger degrees of freedom in the light nuclei in the former as shown in [ secreth ] .",

    "it is also clear that the average mass number grows step - wise for our and hempel s eos s whereas it is monotonic for the h. shen s eos .",
    "this is simply due to the shell effect : nuclei are abundant in the vicinity of the neutron magic numbers ( @xmath204 ) . at higher densities , @xmath9g/@xmath10 ,",
    "the effect is suppressed in our eos , as mentioned already , because the nuclear bulk energy is interpolated from the experimentally derived value and the one obtained theoretically by rmf , which does not include the shell effect .",
    "note also that at these densities there appear very heavy and/or neutron - rich nuclei , for which no experimental mass data are available and we employ rmf for the estimation of their bulk energies ( see section  [ subsecb ] ) .",
    "heavy nuclei continue to grow up until the nuclear saturation density in our eos , whereas the growth stops at some density and nuclei disappear before the saturation density in the hempel s eos ( see the insets of the figure ) , which is at odds with the conventional idea .",
    "this point will be mentioned shortly again .",
    "the discernible difference between our results and the hempel s at @xmath200g/@xmath10 for @xmath205 is attributed to the difference in the masses of neutron - rich nuclei , which we calculate by rmf whereas @xcite obtained from the mass table by @xcite .",
    "the dip in the mass number at @xmath206 for @xmath197 in our eos is artificial , being produced by the neglect of the shell effect in our mass formula .",
    "as nuclei become very neutron - rich , there happens a rather rapid shift of abundant nuclei from those with experimental data to those without , resulting in the observed change of the mass number .",
    "the mass number does not increase until higher densities are reached .",
    "as shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ ma1 ] for @xmath199mev , for example , the mass number starts to increase at @xmath207g/@xmath10 .",
    "this is because the increase of entropy by the translational degrees of freedom of free nucleons is effective to minimize the free energy at this high temperature , whereas the decrease of internal energy by the binding energy of nuclei is more advantageous at lower temperatures .",
    "another interesting feature at this temperature is the decrease of the mass number near the nuclear saturation density for @xmath208 even in our eos .",
    "there are two reasons for this : one is the formation of bubble nuclei and the reduction of surface energy as a result ; the other reason is that the less heavy nuclei become , the greater entropy they have thanks to their larger translational degrees of freedom and they lower the free energy .",
    "it should be noted that unlike in the hempel s eos , nuclei are not dissociated completely in our eos .",
    "the rate of coherent scatterings of neutrinos on nuclei is proportional not to the mass number of nuclei but to its square as long as the wave length of neutrino is much larger than the nuclear size @xcite .",
    "as mentioned already , in sna the rate is evaluated by the mass number squared for the representative nucleus , the validity of which needs confirmation . in the top panels of fig .",

    "it is intriguing to find that the average mass number squared is almost indistinguishable from the square of the average mass number .",
    "the reason for this small dispersion is that heavy nuclei are rather concentrated in the vicinities of the neutron magic numbers .",
    "in this sense , sna is not so bad an approximation in evaluating the rate of coherent scatterings of neutrinos on nuclei .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the mass numbers of the representative nuclei in the h. shen s eos are systematically larger than the average mass numbers obtained in our eos .",
    "incidentally , at very high densities ( @xmath212g/@xmath10 ) , most of nuclei are in the pasta phase .",
    "we demonstrate here that the transition to uniform nuclear matter occurs in one of the following two ways depending on the proton fraction of the entire system , @xmath35 .",
    "the first case corresponds to relatively large proton fractions , @xmath166 . at @xmath213g/@xmath10 ,",
    "most of the nuclei in abundance have a similar proton fraction @xmath214 , which is close to @xmath35 as shown in fig .",
    "[ dis13 ] . as the density rises up to the nuclear saturation density , their w - s cells get smaller and these abundant nuclei enter the pasta phase almost simultaneously . in the bubble phase ,",
    "the volumes occupied by the nuclei in their w - s cells become larger and finally the nuclei coalesce with each other .",
    "the sequence is schematically illustrated for the nucleus with @xmath215 in fig .",
    "note that the density in the vapor , or the bubble , remains lower than that in the nuclei up to the saturation density in this case .",
    "the second case occurs for more neutron - rich systems , @xmath108 .",
    "the proton fractions , @xmath214 , of nuclei having large mass fractions are not necessarily close to @xmath35 of the entire system and take various values at @xmath216g/@xmath10 .",
    "this is due to the fact that more symmetric nuclei have greater binding energies .",
    "hence the nuclei are less neutron - rich than the vapor in general . as a result of this diversity of the proton fractions of the nuclei in abundance , these nuclei",
    "reach the pasta phase at different densities .",
    "put another way , nuclei of different shapes coexist with substantial mass fractions at a particular density above @xmath217g/@xmath10 .",
    "for example , at @xmath197 , @xmath218g/@xmath10 and @xmath181mev , a very heavy nucleus with @xmath219 still remains in the normal phase whereas a very neutron - rich light nucleus with @xmath198 as well as a neutron - rich , slightly heavy nucleus with @xmath220 are already in the bubble phase .",
    "this light nucleus becomes uniform in the w - s cell already at @xmath221g/@xmath10 whereas the others are still non - uniform .",
    "this actually corresponds to the formation of a big nucleus with no bubbles inside , which coexists with other bubble nuclei .",
    "as the density increases further beyond the nuclear saturation density up to the point , where the entire system becomes uniform , the density of this big nucleus also increases , which we referred to as overcompression in section  [ secnuclei ] .",
    "the reason for the occurrence of such overcompression is that the binding energies of nuclei that are less neutron - rich than the whole system are greater in general and the non - uniform matter is energetically favored still at the nuclear saturation density for the whole system . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pc2 ] , the transition to uniform nuclear matter for the very neutron - rich light nuclei occurs by coalescence with each other just as in the first case mentioned above . on the other hand",
    ", the transition for the nuclei with @xmath222 proceeds not by coalescence but by the increase in the density of the vapor . although it is not shown in the figure",
    ", it is interesting that the very heavy nucleus with @xmath219 does not reach the bubble phase and is in the intermediate pasta phase just prior to the transition to uniform nuclear matter .",
    "once the minimization is completed , the baryonic contribution to the free energy , to which our discussions are limited in this paper , is obtained as a function of @xmath223 .",
    "all the thermodynamical quantities are then derived from it through thermodynamical relations .",
    "it turns out that most of them are not very different from the ones in the shen s and hempel s eos s : for the temperatures , @xmath176mev considered in this paper , the three eos s are essentially identical at low densities , @xmath224g/@xmath10 , since the matter is simply composed of free nucleons as an ideal boltzmann gas in all the eos s . at higher densities , @xmath225g/@xmath10 , a small difference appears , since",

    "our free energy is smaller than those of the other two eos s at @xmath216g/@xmath10 .",

    "the step - wise growth of average mass number at low densities is common only to our and g. shen s eos , since the latter also employs experimental mass data . at high densities ,",
    "the lattimer & swesty s and g. shen s eos s employ sna just as the h. shen s eos . not including bubble nuclei , the h. shen s and g. shen s eos s predict very big droplet nuclei where the lattimer & swesty s and our eos give bubble nuclei .",
    "it is interesting , however , to mention incidentally that @xcite also found a shell - like hollow nuclei , which others did not .",
    "there is an ample room for improvement in our eos .",
    "the interpolation of the bulk energy and the treatment of the pasta phase are entirely phenomenological and need justification or sophistication somehow .",
    "our results show that the shell effect is important for the abundance of nuclei . in the present prescription , however , the effect is suppressed maybe too strongly at high densities .",
    "we are planning to adopt an empirical formula for this effect from the literature . with these caveats in mind",
    "we are currently constructing an eos table , which will be available for supernova simulations and put in public domain .",
    "in so doing , electron capture rates , which are consistent with the abundance given by the eos , should be also included . in our formulation , it is quite simple to change the eos for supra - nuclear densities .",
    "in fact , all we need is the free energy density of uniform nuclear matter predicted by the particular eos .",
    "the combination with another eos is under progress at present .",
    "different rmf parametrizations will be also discussed in our forthcoming paper .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of a. ohnishi and c. ishizuka to the core idea .",
    "we would like to thank m. takano for useful information on the mass formula .",
    "is grateful to k. nakazato and n. yasutake for their useful comments .",
