    "the 5-month monitoring observations of _ chandra _ and hst showed short - term ( days to weeks ) morphological variations of the crab nebula ( mori et al .",

    "a variable inner ring and wisps emerging from it visually revealed the existence of the termination shock of the pulsar wind and its downstream flow , respectively .",
    "in addition to such short - term , therefore more noticeable , variations , expansion of the outer torus on longer time scale ( months ) was also discovered",
    ". however , this seems to contradict with the fact that the angular extent of the torus is almost constant over 25 years ( mori et al .",
    "2002 ) ; if the torus kept expanding at the observed rate , it would have become almost twice larger during this period . on the other hand ,",
    "the southern jet did not show a strong variation of its overall structure .",
    "this differs from the highly variable jet of vela ( pavlov et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is an another famous example of a variable pwn . here",
    "we present long - term ( years ) morphological variations of the crab nebula which are newly discovered comparing _",
    "observations over 3 years .",
    "the crab nebula has been observed by several pis with different objectives .",
    "the first observation was performed just after launch ( weisskopf et al . 2000 ) and the latest one was done 3.3 years after that to witness the transit of titan , saturn s largest moon , across the crab nebula ( mori et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) . in this paper , we used those two observations as well as one of the monitoring observations which were performed almost at the midpoint of the first and latest ones .",
    "hereafter , we call them 1st , 2nd , and 3rd epoch observations . they are roughly spaced at 1.7 years interval .",
    "table  [ table : log ] summarizes these observations .    ccccc notation & date & interval ( year ) & exposure ( ksec ) & configuration + 1st & 08/29/99 & - & 2.7 & acis(3.2)+hetg",

    "in contrast with short - term variations are seen at inner regions , the long - term variations are prominent at outer regions : the torus and the southern jet . in the following sections , we will discuss these variations separately .",
    "figure  [ figure : torus ] shows expanded views of the northeast of the torus .",
    "the brightness scales of these images are normalized to the bright region of the torus , not by exposure time , because of the differences of the observational configurations .",
    "images of the 1st and 2nd epoch observations are quite similar .",
    "the bright `` thick '' torus is encircled by circular structures at its northeastern end .",
    "as reported previously , these two structures appear to expand between the 1st and 2nd epoch observations ( mori et al .",
    "2000 ; mori 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast with the similarity between the 1st and 2nd epoch images , the morphological transition from the 2nd to the 3rd epoch image is remarkable .",
    "the bright region of the torus appears to have became shrunken and `` thin '' , and the circular structures have decayed into several arcs .",
    "now it is clear that the torus is not steadily expanding ; the overall extent is almost constant over decades , but the boundary of the torus varies with an angular scale of a few arcseconds and a time scale of years .",
    "it is as if we were seeing a top of a fountain .",
    "greiveldinger & aschenbach ( 1999 ) reported surface brightness variations of the crab nebula using @xmath0 hri observations spanning 6 years .",
    "although @xmath0 could not detect a morphological variation , they showed a monotonic increase of the surface brightness at the northeastern region of the torus .",
    "the brightness variation discovered by @xmath0 is most likely related to the morphological variation discovered by , suggesting that the time scale of the variation of the torus might be about a decade rather than a few years .",
    "figure  [ figure : jet ] shows expanded views of the southern jet of the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd epoch observations . although the displacement of the jet is quite small , the series of images clearly shows the growth of its overall kinked - structure .",
    "the variability of the jet is reminiscent of northern variable jet of vela ( pavlov et al . 2003 ) .",
    "table  [ table : jet ] compares the time scale of the variability and the width between the crab and vela jets .",
    "the crab jet is 10 times larger and varies 10 times slower than the vela jet .",
    "if these variations are due to mhd instability , the time scale is proportional to the alven crossing time , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the width of the jet and @xmath3 is the alven velocity ( begelman 1998 ) . considering that the alven velocity in an ultrarelativistic plasma like the crab and vela pwn is more or less the same , above equation applies to both the crab and vela jet .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that a common mechanism is responsible for the variability of the crab and vela jet .",
