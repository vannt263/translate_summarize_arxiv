    "future @xmath6 collider and its @xmath8 and @xmath9 modes will have a great potential to probe anomalous quartic gauge boson vertices .",

    "non - genuine couplings can be investigated much more efficiently through their trilinear counterpart . in this paper",

    "we take into account incoming beam polarizations and also the final state polarizations of the gauge bosons in the cross - section calculations to improve the bounds .",

    "@xmath68 is the fraction which represents the ratio between the scattered photon and initial electron energy for the backscattered photons moving along the initial electron direction .",
    "maximum value of @xmath68 reaches 0.83 when @xmath69 in which the backscattered photon energy is maximized without spoiling the luminosity .",
    "backscattered photons are not in fixed helicity states their helicities are described by a distribution @xcite :    @xmath70 } \\over{1-y+1/(1-y)-4r(1-r)-\\lambda_{e}\\lambda_{0}r\\zeta ( 2r-1)(2-y)}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 is the energy of backscattered photons .",
    "the differential cross section for the subprocess is then written through the formula    @xmath72    here @xmath73 is the helicity dependent differential cross section in the helicity eigenstates ; @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 or @xmath77 ) .",
    "superscript ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) represent the incoming gamma beams and @xmath78 and @xmath79 represent the corresponding helicity distributions .",

    "we have calculated the cross sections imposing that the polar angles of the produced gauge bosons with the beam pipe are larger than @xmath86 .",
    "one can see from fig.[fig1 ] - [ fig3 ] the influence of the final state polarizations on the deviations of the integrated total cross sections from their sm value for unpolarized initial beams . in these figures",
    "lo stands for longitudinal and unpol stands for unpolarized. transverse polarization configurations of the final bosons are almost insensitive to anomalous couplings .",
    "therefore we omit them from the figures .",
    "it is clear from figures that longitudinally polarized cross sections are sensitive to the anomalous couplings .",
    "the most sensitive polarization configurations are @xmath87(lo , lo , lo ) and ( unpol , lo , lo ) .",
    "for instance in fig.[fig1 ] the cross sections at the polarization configurations ( lo , lo , lo ) and ( unpol , lo , lo ) increase by factors of 22 and 10 as @xmath0 increases from 0 to 0.02 . but",
    "this increment is only a factor of 1.3 in the unpolarized case .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "- [ fig6 ] we see the influence of the initial state polarizations on the deviations of the integrated total cross sections from their sm value .",
    "we accept that initial electron beam polarizability is @xmath88 .",
    "it can be shown from backscattered photon distribution ( 8) that photoproduction cross section for @xmath89 is very low at high energies @xcite .",
    "therefore we have only considered the case @xmath90 in the cross section calculations .",
    "moreover interchanging backscattered photon polarizations ( @xmath91 ) do not change the cross section due to the symmetry . during calculations we consider two different polarization combination ; @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we estimate sensitivity of the @xmath9 collider to anomalous couplings using simple one parameter @xmath95 criterion for the integrated luminosity of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and 1.5 tev energies . in our calculations",
    "we ignore systematic errors and new physics energy scale @xmath23 is taken to be @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that w and z polarizations can be measured .",
    "indeed angular distributions of the w and z decay products have clear correlations with the helicity states of them . for fixed w and z helicities the polarized cross sections can be obtained from a fit to polar angle distributions of the w and z decay products in the w and z rest frames .",
    "therefore we consider the case in which w and z momenta are reconstructible . we restrict ourselves to leptonic decay channel of z boson with a branching ratio @xmath96 ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) and hadronic decay channel of w boson with a branching ratio @xmath99 .",
    "the number of events are given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the efficiency and it is taken to be 0.85 .",
    "leptonic decay channel of w may not be appropriate since the momentum of the neutrino coming from the w decay can not be determined , and consequently , the w rest frame is unknown .",
    "for hadronic w decays , the quark charge is difficult to reconstruct experimentally and only the absolute value of the cosine of the decay angle can be measured .",
    "however , polar angle distribution can still be used to measure the transverse and longitudinal polarization states @xcite .",
    "there have been several experimental studies in the literature for the measurement of w polarization .",
    "w boson polarization has been studied at cern @xmath102 collider lep2 via the process @xmath103 @xcite . at fermilab tevatron ,",
    "polarization of the w bosons produced in the top quark decay has been measured by the cdf and d0 collaborations @xcite .    in table",

    ", lo represents the longitudinal and unpol represents the unpolarized w and z bosons .",
    "transverse polarization states of the final gauge bosons are omitted since the limits for transverse polarization are weak .",
    "we see from these tables that limits on the anomalous couplings are usually very sensitive in @xmath107 initial and @xmath87 ( lo , lo , lo ) , ( unpol , lo , lo ) final polarization configurations . for instance , @xmath93 initial state polarization together with ( lo , lo , lo ) final state polarization ( table [ tab2 ] ) improve the lower bounds of the anomalous couplings @xmath0 and @xmath1 approximately a factor of 5 at @xmath106 tev when compared with the unpolarized case ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "same polarization configuration improve the upper bounds of @xmath0 and @xmath1 approximately factors of 4 and 3.3 at 1.5 tev .",
    "polarization improves also the sensitivity limits on @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath93 initial state polarization together with ( unpol , unpol , lo ) final state polarization improves both the upper and lower bounds of @xmath2 approximately by a factor of 2 at 0.5 tev .",
    "the most sensitive bounds on @xmath2 are obtained in ( lo , lo , lo ) at 1 and 1.5 tev ( table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "this polarization configuration improves the limits on @xmath2 approximately by a factor of 3 at 1 tev and 4 at 1.5 tev .",
    "we have obtained a considerable improvement in the sensitivity bounds by taking into account incoming beam polarizations and also the final state polarizations of the gauge bosons .",
    "the subprocess @xmath57 in the @xmath9 mode of a linear collider with luminosity 500 @xmath108 probes the anomalous @xmath109 , @xmath13 and @xmath110 couplings with a far better sensitivity than the present collider lep2 experiments .",
    "it improves the sensitivity limits by up to a factor of @xmath111 with respect to lep2 .",

    "our bounds on @xmath1 are approximately same with the bounds obtained in @xmath114 and little better than the bounds obtained in @xmath115 .",
