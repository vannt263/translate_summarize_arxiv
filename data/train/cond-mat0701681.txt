    "the quantum dynamics of the charge in insulators is a rich and non - trivial issue even in the d.c . limit",
    "of course , the d.c .",
    "conductivity vanishes , but this does not mean that charge motion is frozen in the insulators .",
    "one example is the ferroelectricity and electric polarization in insulators .",
    "the classical definition of the electric polarization @xmath1 ( @xmath2 : charge density ) fails for the extended bloch wave functions since the @xmath3 is unbounded .",
    "this difficulty is avoided by considering instead the new definition for the _ difference _ of the polarization  @xcite , @xmath4 where the change of the polarization between the initial and final states are given by the integral of the polarization _",
    "current _ during the adiabatic change of the parameters @xmath5 such as the atomic displacements .",
    "one can usually choose the initial state with the inversion symmetry without electric polarization , and ( [ polarization ] ) uniquely determines the polarization of the final state of our interest . here by using @xmath6 the @xmath7-component of @xmath8",
    "is expressed as @xmath9 with the path @xmath10 specified by @xmath11 .",
    "what is found by resta @xcite and king - smith and vanderbuilt @xcite is that @xmath12 can be represented by the berry phase , which fits to the first - principle band calculation .",
    "then the question arises ,  is there any path ( @xmath10 ) dependence of the polarization ? \" .",
    "it is clear that there is no parametrization dependence since we consider the adiabatic change , but the different path @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the @xmath15-space might lead to the different values of @xmath8 .",
    "this is related to the single - valueness and chern number of the bloch wavefunction .",
    "et al . _ addressed this problem as follows by analyzing the one - dimensional two - band models characterized by the three dimensional @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "there appears a singular line , i.e. , string , in the @xmath15-space corresponding to the trajectory of the monopole ( band crossing point ) as the momentum @xmath16 moves , which acts as the  current circuit \" to produce the  magnetic field \" @xmath17 via the biot - savart law .",
    "away from the string , the system is always gapped , and insulating .",
    "when the adiabatic change of the parameter @xmath15 makes a loop enclosing the string , the charge is pumped during this process , which is quantized to be an integer multiple of @xmath18 since the strength of the  current \" is quantized .",
    "this is a realization of the quantum charge pumping first proposed by thouless @xcite .",
    "this analogy to the magnetostatics says that the polarization is path independent as long as the loop @xmath19 does not enclose the string .",
    "this is usually the case because the change of the parameter @xmath15 is rather small and we need the huge variation of @xmath15 to enclose the string , i.e. , gapless states . in other words ,",
    "the ferroelectricity can be regarded as  a fraction of the quantum charge pumping \" .",
    "this charge pumping can be regarded as the rigid shift of the wavefunction due to the change in the external parameters such as the atomic positions .",
    "it is natural when the wavefunction consists of the bloch states extended over the whole sample , and then the quantum interference pattern is modified by the external parameters .",
    "one can estimate roughly how much the charge is pumped as below .",
    "let the dimension of the parameters be the energy .",
    "then the distance between the physically realized set of parameters and that of gapless states , i.e. , string , is the energy gap @xmath20 . when @xmath21 be the change of the the parameters in unit of energy , the angle subtended by this _",
    "segment _ in parameter space is roughly estimated as @xmath22 .",
    "since the @xmath23 winding corresponds to unit charge @xmath18 shift by one lattice constant @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 , the polarization is roughly given by @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "therefore one can enhance the dielectric response by reducing @xmath20 , or enlarging @xmath21 .",
    "one possible method to reduce @xmath20 is by introducing disorder , by which even the gapless insulator can be realized .",
    "however , the electron wavefunctions are no longer the extended bloch states in the presence of the disorder , and one needs to worry about the localization , i.e , anderson localization . when all the states are strongly localized , one can not transmit the phase information though the sample , and hence can not expect the charge pumping either . on the other hand ,",
    "as can be seen from the above explanation , the charge pumping is closely related to the topological nature of the wavefunctions in the parameter space , which is robust against the disorder to some degree .",
    "for example , in the two dimensional electron systems under strong magnetic field , there occur discrete extended states _ protected by the topology_. namely , the chern number is carried by the extended states only , which is not destroyed by the weak disorder .",
    "therefore similar problem arises even for the one - dimensional systems which we study below .",
    "niu and thouless @xcite was the first to study the stability of the charge pumping against the weak disorder by a topological argument .",
    "even though all the states are localized , the charge pumping was shown to be unchanged as long as the gap remains finite .",
    "however , questions still remain such as what is the physical mechanism of the charge pumping through the localized states and what happens when the gap collapses .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of the disorder on the charge pumping and dielectric response in a one - dimensional model for insulators . combining the numerical simulations and analytic considerations , we reveal the physical picture of the charge pumping by the localized states both in the case of open boundary condition and periodic / twisted boundary condition .",
    "the former one is more relevant to the experimental situation such as the feram ( ferroelectric random access memory ) where the leads are attached to the thin film of insulators , while the latter is more appropriate to see the role of topology .",
    "we have published a letter focusing on the open boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this paper provides the full details of the formulation , calculations , and additional results on the open system , as well as new results on the periodic / twisted boundary condition .",
    "the plan of this paper follows . in section",

    "the spin degree of freedom is omitted for simplicity .",
    "then , of our interest is the half - filling case relevant to the ferroelectrics .",
    "although this model might look special , it represents the two essential feature of the ferroelectrics , i.e. , ( i ) the two species of the ions characterized by the level alternation @xmath38 and ( ii ) relative shift of the atomic positions described by the dimerization @xmath39 .",
    "it corresponds to the ferroelectricity in e.g. batio@xmath40 , where ti and o are dimerized to produce the polarization @xcite .",
    "it can be also applied to the quasi - one dimensional ferroelectric materials such as organic charge transfer compounds ttf - ca  @xcite and ( tmttf)@xmath41x  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath42 under the periodic boundary condition yields two bands@xcite @xmath43    experimentally , the parameters @xmath44 can be controlled by applying the electric field @xmath45 along the polarization direction and the pressure @xmath46 as follows .",

    "is expected to play essential roles via novel quantum interference as discussed in the introduction  @xcite .",
    "namely , a theory for the nano - scale capacitance is called for where the quantum coherence is attained all through the sample . > from the viewpoint of the applications , it is required to achieve ( i ) a magnitude of the polarization larger than 10 @xmath7c/@xmath54 , ( ii ) a smaller leak current than 0.1 - 1 @xmath7a/@xmath54 , and ( iii ) a dielectric constant larger than 300  @xcite . by introducing disorder",
    ", one can also suppress the dissipation by leak current due to the strong localization effect  @xcite in addition to the reduction of the gap and enhanced dielectric response .",
    "in fact , a similar disorder - driven enhanced response has been found in relaxor ferroelectrics  @xcite and pinned charge density waves  @xcite , although its mechanism is due to a classical mesoscopic cluster formation analogous to spin glass systems .    in the disordered case with all the states being localized",

    "the system is a band insulator .",
    "the magnitude of the energy gap is given by the magnitude of the cdw order parameter @xmath267 .",
    "in the presence of the disorder , the gap closes when the magnitude of the disorder potential becomes the order of @xmath268 .",

    "although we have defined ( [ deltap ] ) , ( [ dpolar_dd1 ] ) and ( [ dpolar_dd2 ] ) only for @xmath269 and @xmath270 , we henceforth extend these formulae to general @xmath27 , which makes the topological properties of the charge pumping manifest .",
    "we note that except for @xmath269 and @xmath257 , @xmath271 does not mean a change of polarization . with this extension to arbitrary @xmath27 ,",

    "furthermore , when the parameters @xmath129 are changed along a cycle , the pumped charge can be written as @xmath276 where @xmath60 is a loop on the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane .",

    "if there is a energy crossing , the gauge field @xmath285 has a u(1 ) monopole there , and the averaged charge @xmath284 becomes a total strength of the monopoles inside the torus , again by using the gauss theorem . as the monopole strength is quantized to be an integer , @xmath284 is always an integer .",
    "this discussion for ( [ torus_surface ] ) corresponds to that for ( 2.23)in ref .",
    ", in which they claimed that the charge transport is quantized in the presence of gap which does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the aim of this paper targets at another respect : we are interested in the strong disorder case , in which the energy gap closes in the thermodynamic limit and all wave functions are localized characterized by the localization length @xmath118 defined by @xmath288 , where @xmath289 is the single particle wave function .",
    "nevertheless , for finite - sized systems gap always exists which is the order of the band width divided by the size of the system , which validates the above topological argument even in the strongly disordered cases .",
    "in such disordered systems , the field strength @xmath290 is highly anisotropic around the monopoles , which is closely related with a `` resonance tunnelling '' picture in section iii.b as we explain in the next paragraph .",
    "the adiabatic charge transfer is based on the occurrence of the singularity in the parameter space@xcite , which happens when lumo and homo are degenerate . by making a close contour enclosing the singularity , the wave function shifts as shown in fig .  [ fig:1dring ] .",
    "since the disorder potential is random , we expect that the proliferation of the singularities may occur .",
    "furthermore , there could be _ singularity string _ rather than _ point _ in the strong disorder limit .",
    "the reason is given as the following . in the strong disorder limit , all wave functions are localized .",
    "there could be a situation that the wave function of the lumo and the homo are well separated so that the overlap integral of two wavefunctions are exponentially small as the parameters change .",
    "thus even when the change of parameters in numerics or in experiments is very slow , its timescale might be still shorter than the inverse of the ( exponentially small ) overlap integral of the lumo and homo .",
    "therefore , within this variation of parameters , the lumo and homo can be regarded as degenerate .",
    "once they are degenerate at a certain point in the parameter space , they will keep the near - degeneracy as the parameters change until their wave functions have appreciable overlap and open a gap .",
    "as long as they remain nearly degenerate as the parameters change , the singularity string is created in the parameter space .",
    "moreover , because the wave functions are highly localized on the singularity string , they are _ insensitive to the boundary condition _ , in other words , @xmath27-independent .",
    "therefore , they have the sheet - like structure extending along the @xmath27-direction in the parameter space .",
    "even though it is sheet - like , we call it a string referring to its projection on the @xmath267 plane . from this observation",
    ", we conclude that the singularity in the parameter space projected on @xmath38 and @xmath39 subspace has two kinds , points and strings , in the strong disorder limit .",
    "the former contribute to the charge transfer , while the latter do not .",
    "the charge transfer for the former is explained within the resonance tunnelling section [ section : resonance - periodic ] .      in this section ,",
    "we solve numerically the eigenvalue problem for slowly varying parameters @xmath129 and calculate the contour integral in ( [ gauge_flux ] ) .",
    "we introduce the small segment @xmath291 for the contour integral , and demand that @xmath292 are continuous .",
    "therefore , the size @xmath293 determines the energy - scale and time - scale of our simulation . in actual calculation",
    ", we take @xmath294 as the finest one .",

    "let us remind the readers that the distribution function for the pure case is the @xmath299function at the origin@xcite . in that case , we do not need to integrate over @xmath27 to obtain the quantization of the charge transfer , because the singularity lives in the @xmath300 space , and the integration over @xmath16 is already included implicitly in ( [ distribution ] ) .",
    "our result can be summarized by the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] .",
    "first , we found that @xmath301 if we take the loop * a * which is the outer dash one ( @xmath302 ) and average over @xmath27 .",
    "it corresponds to the weak disorder case where the strength of the disorder is much smaller than @xmath303 , so the potential strength is not large enough to close the gap . according to niu and thouless@xcite",
    ", the polarization is quantized , and we reproduce their result here . secondly , the singularity strings appear in the region @xmath304 . in this region ,",
    "the disorder potential is strong enough to close the gap . as we pointed out in the section [ section : formalism ] , there are two kinds of the singularities , points and strings . in the `` stringful '' region",

    "point_. it is because the operation of the adiabatic process changes when making the contour across a string . in fig .",

    "[ total_adiabatic](a ) .",
    "[ total_adiabatic](b ) shows the adiabatic process of the contour across the string . in this case , because the wave functions of the homo and the lumo do not overlap , the adiabatic process needs to keep ramping up to the higher energy state at the first degenerate point and ramp down to the lower energy state at a second degenerate point , which completes a close loop .",
    "note that the energy of the homo is larger than that of the lumo after the first degenerate point and becomes smaller again after the second degenerate point .",
    "in other words , the system stays in the same state , and thus the charge does not transfer at all after a close contour .",
    "therefore , even if we make a close loop which encloses a whole singularity string , the charge does not transfer . it should be noted that even though the system is at a higher energy state , it takes @xmath305 to relax , where @xmath32 is the size of the system , and @xmath118 is the typical localization length which is around 3 sites in our case .    in fig .",
    "[ total_adiabatic](c ) , we demonstrate a real process across a singularity string indicated by the loop * c * in fig .  [ fig : distribution ] .",
    "usually , we refer singularity string to the degenerate manifold between the homo and lumo . in a real process",
    ", we may have to consider the degeneracy between the homo and the 2@xmath306 lumo .",
    "for example , after the degenerate point between lumo and homo , the descending order in energy is 2@xmath306 lumo , homo , and the lumo .",
    "there is the possibility , for example the boundary @xmath307 in fig .",
    "[ total_adiabatic](c ) , that the energy of 2@xmath306 lumo and that of homo can be the same along the contour before meeting the next degenerate point between homo and lumo .",
    "if it happens , the system still stays in the original homo state by ramping further up to the higher energy state .",
    "after that , the descending order in energy becomes homo , 2@xmath306 lumo , and lumo .",

    "singularity strings are like the branch cuts which connect different riemann sheets .",
    "contours on the @xmath267 plane are very similar to the one in the complex plane .",

    "[ fig : distribution ] to be 1.0 , _ there must be at least two monopoles and one antimonopole in our system , which demonstrates the proliferation of the monopole - antimonopole pairs in the strong disorder limit .",
    "_ unfortunately , we are not able to locate monopoles exactly but obtain rough position , since they merge in the string - ful soup .",

    "the thouless number has a ridge structure which exactly coincides with the valley in the gap function . ]",
    "we now compare the numerical results with the picture of resonance tunnelling discussed in sec .",
    "[ section : resonance - open ] . in the resonance tunnelling scenario , we can deal with the periodic system by identifying @xmath318 with @xmath146 .",
    "it leads to @xmath171 .",
    "in such a periodic system , as is apart from an open system , @xmath319 is no longer a tunable parameter , but corresponds to discrete energy levels of the system .",
    "thus , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 are smooth functions of @xmath320 , @xmath321 and an energy @xmath45 .",
    "because the periodic system is threaded by a flux of @xmath322 , we require that @xmath323 it yields @xmath324 , i.e. @xmath325 . because @xmath326 is a function of @xmath320 , @xmath321 and @xmath45 , this defines a ( discrete ) energy level of the system as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we study the monopoles in the framework of resonance tunnelling .",
    "as the monopoles appear at band - crossing points , we have to look for degenerate solutions of ( [ eq : periodiceq ] ) .",
    "namely , we look for cases with two ( degenerate ) states for fixed @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath45",
    ". this happens if and only if the matrix @xmath149 is equal to @xmath239 .",
    "this condition reduces to @xmath327 where @xmath179 and @xmath328 are integers .",
    "because @xmath152 , @xmath130 , @xmath201 and @xmath329 are functions of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath45 , the three conditions ( [ eq : s1s2periodic ] ) , ( [ eq : omegaperiodic ] ) and ( [ eq : omegaperiodic ] ) determine a set of isolated points in the @xmath38-@xmath39-@xmath45 space . combining with ( [ eq : alphaperiodic ] ) , we get isolated points in the @xmath38-@xmath39-@xmath27 space , corresponding to the monopoles / antimonopoles @xcite . except for the vicinity of the monopoles / antimonopoles ,",
    "the field @xmath290 is almost @xmath27-independent , because the system is almost intact with the change of @xmath27 .",
    "thus the distribution of the field @xmath290 is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance - periodic](a ) .",
    "in contrast with a small - sized model @xmath209 in ref .  , in our disordered model ( @xmath208 ) the `` near - field '' region where the flux density is @xmath27-dependent is limited only in the very close vicinity of the monopoles / antimonopoles",
    ".    equations ( [ eq : omegaperiodic ] ) and ( [ eq : omegaperiodic ] ) are the bohr quantization conditions , meaning that the there are two localized states around @xmath330 and @xmath331 ( @xmath332 ) , having the same energy . in general , when there are two localized states with the same energy , displaced each other by a high potential peak , there is a small tunnelling matrix element between them .",
    "it gives a small energy splitting between bonding and anti - bonding states . as a result",
    ", the degeneracy is lifted .",
    "nevertheless , when the equality ( [ eq : s1s2periodic ] ) holds , it guarantees that the hybridization between them cancels exactly , and the degeneracy is not lifted even after one takes the tunnelling into account .",
    "thus the two localized states are in resonance with each other .",
    "equation ( [ eq : alphaperiodic ] ) means that such exact degeneracy occurs only when @xmath27 is equal to @xmath257 or @xmath256 , confirming our numerical result .",
    "if we change @xmath320 and @xmath321 to make @xmath333 with the conditions ( [ eq : omegaperiodic ] ) and ( [ eq : omegaperiodic ] ) preserved , there occurs a small splitting ( @xmath334 ) to the otherwise degenerate states , due to a small unbalance between @xmath152 and @xmath130 .",
    "these conditions ( [ eq : omegaperiodic ] ) and ( [ eq : omegaperiodic ] ) specify one direction in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane from the monopole . along this direction",
    "the gap remains nonzero but very small , thereby the field @xmath290 becomes large as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance - periodic ] ( b ) . in our numerical results",
    ", this direction corresponds to the valley direction in the energy gap , and the ridge in the thouless number in fig .",
    "[ fig : thouless_number ] .",
    "thus the anisotropy of the energy gap in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane is of the order @xmath335 . because in our numerical calculation @xmath336 , @xmath337 , the anisotropy of the monopole is @xmath338 , which should be compared with the numerical value @xmath339 in the previous subsection .",
    "their difference can be attributed to finiteness of the mesh size in the numerical calculation ; the mesh may not be fine enough to reproduce the anisotropy @xmath340 .",
    "we also note that the strings observed in the numerical calculation can be regarded as the curve of @xmath183 , @xmath341 , with @xmath152 and @xmath130 are unrestricted .     around the monopole .",
    "( a ) the field @xmath290 is mostly uniform in the @xmath27-direction because @xmath208 , except for the vicinity of the monopole .",
    "( b ) the field is anisotropic in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane.,width=321 ]      in fig.([antimonopole]f ) , we show the wave functions of the homo and lumo , which supports the resonance tunnelling scheme . at the resonance ,",
    "the energy of homo and lumo are degenerate .",
    "if homo sits at @xmath146 , lumo can be viewed as the resonance state at the potential valley @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , by means of lumo , homo can tunnel through the whole sample .",
    "we must emphasize that this mechanism is topological as that in the pure case .",
    "the adiabatic rate depends on the energy gap . at the resonance ,",
    "the wave functions of the homo and the lumo do not overlap . by tuning",
    "the parameters , the overlapping integral between these two states are not zero , and thus the gap opens up .",
    "again , the rates that the gap opens with the parameters are not necessarily the same .",
    "therefore , the monopole ( antimonopole ) structure is not necessarily isotropic . if fact , it can be highly anisotropic as shown in our calculation .",
    "then , the adiabatic rate is restricted by the minimal gap along the contour .",
    "it can be roughly estimated as @xmath342 , where @xmath343 is the localization length at the resonance .",
    "the current results for the periodic / twisted boundary condition is consistent with those for the open boundary condition .",
    "the topological structure in the open boundary condition , namely the vortices , can be regarded as a projection of the monopoles to a 2-dimensional plane .",
    "the anisotropic flux distribution and the anisotropic phase gradient are two facets of the resonance tunnelling . while the results for the open boundary condition is more applicable to the real materials and design , the non - trivial generation of the monopole - anti - monopole shown in the periodic / twisted boundary condition case illustrates the deep and whole new topological structure in the strong disordered systems .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the charge pumping and dielectric response in disordered insulator for both the open boundary condition and periodic / twisted boundary condition . as for the open system coupled to the leads",
    ", we have found the quantum - mechanically enhanced dielectric response in nanoscopic / mesoscopic disordered insulators , which give a guide for fast and low - dissipation ferroelectric thin films of the feram .",
    "the phase of the reflection coefficient @xmath62 is a key parameter for the pumping , and has the rich structure in the parameter plane .",
    "topological nature of the insulator dictates the phase winding of @xmath62 , around the vortex where @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in a pure insulator",
    ", this corresponds to the gapless point . in the disordered case",
    ", it corresponds to the resonance tunnelling through the sample , whose position varies with the chemical potential .    with the periodic closed system",
    ", we can consider the three dimensional parameter space @xmath344 where @xmath38 is the site energy alternation , @xmath39 is the bond dimerization , and @xmath27 is the phase twist for the boundary condition .",
    "in this three dimensional space , one can discuss the monopoles and the their associated gauge field distribution , which are again interpreted in terms of the resonant tunnelling .",
    "the existence of the resonant tunnelling in the parameter space is guaranteed by the topological properties of the charge pumping , and only two parameters such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 need to be tuned to realize it .",
    "these parameters can be controlled experimentally by the external electric field and pressure .",
    "therefore the present theory offers a way to design the enhanced dielectric response in realistic systems by controlling the disorder .",
