    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are now known to host at least two stellar populations , distinct in chemical composition ( e.g. carretta et al . 2009a , b ) .",
    "the different populations differ mostly in light element ( c , n , o , na , mg , al ) abundances , while star - to - star abundance variations in elements heavier than si are generally not detected ( gratton et al . 2004 ) .",
    "+ so far , various models have been put forward to explain the abundance pattern observed in gcs and to understand the origin of their multiple populations .",
    "the most popular models consider a scenario in which a second generation ( sg ) of stars forms from the gas ejected by either first generation ( fg ) asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ( cottrell & da costa 1981 ; dantona & caloi 2004 ; karakas et al . 2006 ; dercole et al .",
    "2008 ; bekki 2011 ) , or fg fast rotating massive stars ( prantzos & charbonnel 2006 ; decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) . in both scenarios ,",
    "the gc precursors have to be more massive ( by factors between 5 and 20 ) than the objects we see today . in the agb scenario ,",
    "a key question is whether the gas enenergized by the fg of supernovae ( sne ) is lost by the system at the time the sg forms .",
    "this scenario requires that the pristine gas has to be completely lost if very o - poor sg stars may form as observed in some gcs ( carretta et al .",
    "2009a ; dercole et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , understanding whether after the formation of the fg the residual gas is expelled is fundamental in order to support this scenario .",
    "previous studies indicate that in clusters of mass @xmath6 , once radiative losses are taken into account , the combined energy of all sne can be lower than the potential energy of the gas ( dopita & smith 1986 ; baumgardt et al .",
    "2008 ) , hence a significant fraction of the initial gas will be retained .",
    "however , there has been no attempt to study gas loss from such a massive proto - gc by means of realistic three dimensional ( 3d ) simulations .",
    "the use of 3d hydrodynamic simulations is crucial in order to investigate in detail the structure of the outflow and how the gas can escape from the system , as well as the spatial extent of such potential escape routes .",
    "moreover , taking into account a realistic distribution of stars in a cluster is crucial , in order to assess the relative , contrasting roles of stellar feedback and radiative losses .",
    "+ in this work , we run 3d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the response of the typical gas - rich gc precursor of mass @xmath7 to the action of multiple feedback sources , including both stellar winds and supernovae , occurring in stellar associations .",
    "our aim is to assess on firmer grounds whether the system can lose its gas via internal processes alone .",
    "this letter is primarily aimed at presenting our results on the main subject of our investigation , i.e. whether the feedback of stellar winds and sne in one massive proto - cluster is sufficient to remove its gas . a more extended description of our results is postponed to a future paper .",
    "the simulations have been performed using the ramses code ( teyssier 2002 ) .",
    "the gc is initially composed of a self - gravitating gas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium , and of a fg of stars already in place . to study the impact of the feedback from massive stars in a massive precursor of nowadays gcs",
    ", we assume a total initial mass @xmath1 , of which @xmath8 are in stars .",
    "this equates to a star formation efficiency ( sfe ) @xmath9 , consistent with the general requirement that the formation of gcs occurs preferentially in high - pressure regions , characterised by sfes somewhere between 0.25 and 0.5 ( e.g. elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .    the initial , non - rotating mass distribution follows a plummer ( 1911 ) density profile , characterised by a density @xmath10 expressed as : @xmath11 in this equation , @xmath12 is the radius and @xmath13  pc is the plummer radius  pc and truncation radius @xmath14  pc . here , we use instead a plummer profile with the same half - mass radius , i.e. @xmath15  pc . ] .",
    "this corresponds to a rather dense system , characterised by a central gas density of @xmath16  @xmath17 . + a static gravitational potential",
    "is assumed for the stellar component , expressed by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the universal gravitational constant .",
    "the self - gravity of the gas is taken into account and the potential due to the gas distribution @xmath20 is computed at each timestep by solving the poisson equation in an adaptive grid framework , as described in teyssier ( 2002 ) .",
    "for the gas component , the initial pressure profile is determined by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation : @xmath21    in our simulation , the computational box has a volume of @xmath22  pc@xmath23 and is characterised by a maximum resolution of @xmath24  pc .",
    "this assumption , together with the minimum temperature floor of @xmath25 ( see sect .  [ feed ] ) assures that the jeans length is always well above 4 times the maximum resolution , a condition sufficient to avoid artificial fragmentation in simulations of self - gravitating gas ( truelove et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "free outflow boundary conditions are used .",
    "the refinement stategy is both geometry- and discontinuity - based . at each timestep , in correspondence of the position of each source a number of cells at the highest refinement level were created as described in sect .",
    "[ feed ] .",
    "a passive tracer was created to study the evolution of the metallicity @xmath26 within each cell , with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the density of metals in a given cell . for the initial metallicity",
    ", we have chosen the value @xmath29 ( dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the heating sources are the massive stars ( ms ,  @xmath30 ) , which are allowed to release mass and energy in both their pre - supernova ( pre - sn ) and supernova ( sn ) phases . adopting a standard imf ( e.g. kroupa 2001 ) ,",
    "@xmath30.01 ms are born per @xmath31 of stars formed .",
    "the total ms population has been split into a number of separate ob associations ( obas ) ; each association is allowed to continuously inject energy and mass for 30 myr , a time which roughly corresponds to the lifetimes of stars of @xmath32 .",
    "the energy and mass input rate from obas is approximated as continuous ( mac low & mccray 1988 ) and constant in time . during the pre - sn ( i.e. at times @xmath33 myr ) and sn phases",
    ", we assume that an oba which includes @xmath34 massive stars ejects @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xmath37 and emits @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ( leitherer et al . 2014 )    the ms number @xmath34 is sampled randomly from the power - law distribution @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( higdon & lingenfelter 2005 ; melioli et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the obas have been scattered in the simulation volume by sampling randomly from the mass distribution expressed by eq .  [ plum ] .",
    "the probability of having an oba located at a distance @xmath43 from the center of the computational box is given by the number @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a random number , with @xmath47 .",
    "standard coordinate transformations are used to derive cartesian coordinates of each oba , and the values for the quantity @xmath48 and the azimuthal angle @xmath49 were determined by sampling randomly from flat distributions . to avoid the occurrence of diamond - shaped shock fronts we give our energy sources a radial size of @xmath50  pc ( @xmath33 times the maximum resolution ) .",
    "the total thermal energy and mass injected into the ism per unit volume by the oba in the time step @xmath51 are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the volume of a single oba .",
    "+ the cooling function implemented in ramses takes into account both atomic ( i.e. , due to h and he ) and metal cooling , due to the presence of metals ( see few et al .",
    "the contribution from metals at temperatures above @xmath57 k is accounted for through a fit of the difference between the cooling rates calculated at solar metallicity and those at zero metallicity using the photoionisation code cloudy ( ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) . at lower temperatures ,",
    "metal fine - structure cooling rates are taken from rosen & bregman ( 1995 ) .",
    "for computational reasons , a constant - value temperature floor @xmath58 is assumed .    in general , in high density regions the feedback energy returned to the ism",
    "is radiated away extremely quickly ( katz 1992 ) ; so far , various methods have been proposed to prevent immediate radiative loss of the energy injected by massive stars ( thacker & couchman 2000 ) . in this work",
    ", we switch off cooling in suitable grids following the prescriptions of teyssier et al .",
    "we assume that each oba injects in the ism an amount of non - thermal energy of the same order of magnitude as the thermal energy .",
    "in each cell @xmath59 and at the time @xmath60 , we introduce a non - thermal velocity dispersion @xmath61 , defined as : @xmath62 where the passive tracer @xmath63 is the cumulative energy density injected by the obas and @xmath64 is the density in the cell at the @xmath65th timestep . as assumed in teyssier et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we switch off cooling in any cell for which @xmath66 .",
    "this simple prescription is aimed at capturing roughly the sub - grid non - thermal processes , such as turbulence , which allow a more efficient coupling of the energy associated with stellar feedback to the gas component ( see teyssier et al .",
    "the complex structure of the interstellar medium as driven by stellar wind activity and sne is visible in figure  [ fig2 ] , where we show 2d density and temperature maps calculated for our gc model in the x - y plane at various simulation times .",
    "the velocity fields are also shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] as arrows , drawn only for velocities with values greater than @xmath67 of the maximum value , which is reported in the top - right inset of each panel , along with the simulation time .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , several cavities filled with hot , low - density gas created by the activity of the stellar winds are already visible at 0.5 myr , when a few superbubbles expanding supersonically in the unperturbed medium still conserve a nearly round shape .",
    "this is true mainly for the isolated ones , located in low - density regions . on the other hand , bubbles originating from sources with one or more obas",
    "nearby show significant distortions and appear asymmetrically compressed even at early times .",
    "after the merging of multiple blowouts , the shells around each bubble have dissolved and a high - density , low - temperature region is visible in the center of the cluster at @xmath68  myr , created by the coupled action of multiple wind - blown bubbles , pushing material in opposite directions , and by the gravity of the system . outside the central region , at 1.6 myr the low density gas occupies elongated shapes which extend out to the boundaries .",
    "the gas reaches the highest velocities within these lowest density regions ; as visible at the bottom of the panels computed at 5.1 myr , some of the velocities are still directed preferentially towards the centre , i.e. they move mostly under the influence of gravity . in the meantime , the extent of the high - density central region is reducing and the filling factor of the hottest , lowest density cavities is increasing .",
    "some of the hot gas is channelling towards the boundaries , as shown by the outwards - directed velocity field , in particular at the left and right sides of the map at 5.1 myr .",
    "the maps calculated at 10 myr show how nearly all the space is now filled with low - density , high - temperature gas . in nearly every point of the plot ,",
    "the velocities are now directed outwards .",
    "the central cold filament occupies a limited portion of the plane , without affecting substantially the large - scale motion of the gas .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the time evolution of the mass - weighted density profiles . the radial profiles reported in fig .  [ fig3 ] have been calculated at 0 , 0.5 , 1.6 , 5.1 and 10 myr . at @xmath69  myr ,",
    "a significant increase in the central density is clearly visible . at 1.6 myr , a considerable mass re - distribution has occurred , as traced by the density profile which in in the innermost 15 pc has significantly steepened with respect to the initial one , with a density still increasing in the center and decreasing in the outskirts .",
    "part of this mass re - distribution is due to the feedback from obas , whose impact is already appreciable as they cause the removal of a non - negligible amount of the initial gas mass ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .    as explained in sect",
    ".  [ feed ] , at 3 myr sne take over as primary feedback sources , with mechanical luminosities significantly larger than those characterising pre - sn . as a consequence of this , between @xmath68  myr and @xmath70",
    "myr the system undergoes significant removal of the gas .",
    "the radial profile calculated at 10 myr is considerably lower than the initial one . at this time , more than @xmath71 of the initial gas mass has been removed .",
    "our results thus confirm the assumption of the agb scenario for the multi - population gcs , i.e. that the energy restored by massive stars is sufficient to clear the system of all the pristine gas .",
    "our numerical experiments show that the simultaneous action of several feedback sources realistically distributed within a gc leads to the removal of the gas initially present in the system . in a configuration where the feedback sources are scattered in the simulation volume as described in sect .",
    "[ feed ] , the character of the outflow is not as stationary and smooth as described in works assuming a more uniform source distribution in starbursting and dwarf galaxies ( chevalier & clegg 1985 , silich & tenorio - tagle 1998 ) . even if the energy and mass inputs of the obas are continuous , no homogeneous outflow is generated by the obas , but rather an inhomogeneous flow through which the gas leaks out along the paths of least resistance . the resistance is created by the dense filaments as illustrated by the velocity field , in that the fast , low - density gas is often deviated whenever it encounters an extended , high - density sheet .",
    "such porous and filamentary structures are common in 3d hydrodynamic simulations of starburst - driven winds ( rodriguez - gonzalez et al . 2008 ; cooper et al . 2008 ; melioli et al . 2013 ) .    a major role in the generation of the outflow is played by the feedback sources during the pre - sn phase , i.e. when the feedback is dominated by stellar winds , active within the first 3 myr of evolution .",
    "these sources are not only important since they can carve large , hot and tenuous cavities around stellar associations ( see breitschwerdt & de avillez 2006 ; hopkins et al . 2012a ; rogers & pittard 2013 ; dale et al .",
    "2014 , geen et al . 2015 ) , in which sne explode and can restore energy at high thermalization efficiencies , but also as highly efficient feedback agents ( leitherer et al . 1992 ; rosen et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the coherence of different associations is a fundamental ingredient : as the bubbles interact , distort and merge , the narrow tunnels reach deeper and deeper towards the innermost cluster regions . the idea that the coherence of different sources is a basic requirement for a large thermalization efficiency is not new :",
    "in fact , previous works have already shown that single , episodic , isolated feedback sources are known to be less efficient than multiple sources acting simultaneously ( nath & shchekinov 2013 ; sharma et al .",
    "2014 ) . in our case ,",
    "different ob associations act coherently and are able to generate expanding bubbles which rapidly interact and merge .",
    "our simulations indicate that a timescale of a few myr is sufficient for a significant amount of gas depletion to occur within gcs .",
    "we find that after @xmath5 myr , 99@xmath4 of the initial gas mass has been removed .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we show the time evolution of the gas fraction , normalized to the initial value , computed at different resolutions .",
    "interestingly , current observational studies of very young , massive clusters ( m@xmath72 ) show that they are able to clear out their natal gas within a few myr after their formation ( e.g. , bastian et al .",
    "2014 ) , although the mechanisms responsible for such a rapid gas removal of gas is not entirely known .",
    "the most plausible candidates could be massive stars in the stellar wind phase , although the observed bubble sizes appear to be larger than those predicted by hydrodynamic models including feedback from stellar winds ( dale et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the future",
    ", it will be important to study , with simulations like the ones presented here , the causes of this discrepancy , in particular the role of the assumed initial cluster compactness and possibly the impact of various feedback processes , such as radiation pressure . + a look at fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] suggests also that the mass decrease is rather robust with respect to resolution , even if in the simulations performed at lower resolution , gas depletion seems to occur slightly faster .",
    "in general , numerical convergence with amr simulations is more difficult to obtain than with uniform grid codes ( li 2010 ; schmidt et al . 2014 ) . in our case",
    ", the differences at various resolutions could be partially ascribed to the poisson solver , which sometimes fails to converge at lower resolution .",
    "we have considered a cluster of large initial mass ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "this choice was motivated by the fact that according to current models of gc formation , at the moment of their formation , clusters had to be 5 - 20 times more massive than their present - day mass value ( dercole et al .",
    "this mass value is also a critical one for gas removal , as previous studies indicate that in systems of @xmath7 , sne are unable to unbind all the natal gas ( dopita & smith 1986 ; baumgardt et al .",
    "2008 ; krause et al . 2012",
    "; leigh et al . 2013 ) .",
    "in principle , in lower mass clusters the gas removal should be more rapid , as densities and radiative losses should be lower and ob stars eject enough energy to disperse gas clouds within a few myr ( baumgardt et al .",
    "as already mentioned , an important parameter to study in the future will be the cluster compactness , also because gas removal could in principle be more difficult in clusters with larger central densities .",
    "furthermore , the role of mass segregation needs to be studied in detail .",
    "these topics are currently under investigation and results will be presented in a forthcoming work .",
    "we conclude with a few notes on the simplifications made in this work and on some neglected physical processes .",
    "hii photoionisation has been neglected and could produce important effects at such high densities ( hopkins et al .",
    "2012a ) . to properly account for this process",
    ", full radiative transfer calculations would be required ( see hopkins et al .",
    "2012a , 2012b ) . in principle , this process could further facilitate gas removal from proto - gcs .",
    "star formation is assumed to take place instantaneously at the start of the run and , in principle , it could take place in the densest and coolest cluster regions . to study the effect of star formation longer timescales need to be considered , and the inclusion of this process has certainly a high priority in future studies .",
    "magnetic fields have also been neglected ; little is currently known about how they couple with stellar feedback and how this affects the evolution of the ism .",
    "what is known so far is that magnetic fields could represent a further feedback agent .",
    "in fact , current studies of magnetic fields in sn remnants suggest that they could play a role in reheating the gas at epochs of the order of a few myr ( balsara et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "thermal conduction is also neglected in our simulation , however , numerical diffusion simulates this process originating spurious radiative losses which otherwise would be absent .",
    "detailed calculations show that the amount of radiation lost due to diffusion is larger than that of a realistic heat conduction front ( recchi et al .",
    "a proper description of conductive fronts requires a very high resolution and would be extremely computationally demanding ( recchi & hensler 2007 ) .",
