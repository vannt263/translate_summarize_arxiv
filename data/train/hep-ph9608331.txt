    "during last several years , there was a significant increase in the interest in the low energy qcd and in understanding the low energy hadron dynamics .",
    "this happened both due to the theoretical progress and to the availability of new experimental data .",
    "however , the problem of understanding the low energy properties of hadrons is still far from being solved , due to the need to understand the nonperturbative qcd effects that govern the hadron dynamics .    the qcd sum rules , first suggested by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review ) , historically are one of the most effective tools used to study the low energy properties of hadrons .",
    "the method was successfully applied to numerous low energy problems , such as the determination of the mass spectrum of the low - lying resonances , of the form - factors etc .",
    "the goal of the present note is to use qcd sum rules in order to calculate the @xmath0 transition constant .",
    "let us recall that this constant is defined @xcite by the equation : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the invariant amplitude for the @xmath0 transition , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote momenta and polarisations of   @xmath7  and  @xmath8 .",
    "experimental  value for   @xmath1   is  about  14 @xmath9 2 gev @xmath2 . within the framework of qcd sum rules ,",
    "@xmath1 was already considered several times @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite varied from 17 gev@xmath2 to 15 gev @xmath2 , that were in an agreement with the experimental data up to 20% - 30% - the usual error of the method .",
    "ref @xcite gives for this constant 9 gev @xmath2 that contradicts both the previous calculations and the experimental data .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite present two results .",
    "the first one supports calculations of ref .",
    "in order to obtain the second result they modified sum rules incorporating the abj axial anomaly and finally @xmath1 was estimated as 16 gev @xmath2 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the light cone sum rule method was used to determine a wave - function of @xmath10 meson .",
    "the results gave 15 gev @xmath2 for @xmath1 .",
    "some uncertainty in predictions and a significant mismatch between results of ref . @xcite and the other obtained results have drawn us to reconsider @xmath1 .    in this note we calculate @xmath1 using the qcd sum rules for the polarisation operator in external axial field .",
    "this method was first discovered in ref @xcite and since was used to determine the magnetic moments of baryons @xcite , axial coupling constants and electro - magnetic form - factors of nucleons @xcite at low momenta transfer , to study @xmath11 transitions @xcite , etc .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it permits one to work directly in the region of small momenta transfer ( by paying the price of introducing new condensates , see below ) .",
    "note that this is exactly the case at hand : the masses of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are almost equal , hence the momentum of virtual @xmath10 meson is expected to be small .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we shortly remind the reader the basics of qcd sum rules method in external field . sec .",
    "3 is devoted to the main calculations and in the sec .",
    "4 we give the conclusions .",
    "let us review in short the qcd sum rules for polarisation operator in external field .",
    "we start with the polarisation operator : @xmath12 here @xmath13 are the quark currents that create @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons : @xmath16    the index @xmath17 means that we consider this correlator in the external axial field @xmath18 that corresponds to the following term in the lagrangian :    @xmath19    here @xmath20 is the external field momentum and @xmath21 is the quark current that creates pion : @xmath22 the expression ( [ h3 ] ) contains , generally speaking , terms of different powers in @xmath23",
    ". we shall be interested here in the terms linear in @xmath17 only .",
    "they appear both when considering the propagator of the quarks in the external field and when taking into account the interaction of the external field with the quark condensate .",
    "moreover , as it is explained below , it is enough to carry the actual calculations for the case @xmath24 , i.e. for the case of constant external field . in the latter case , in the approximation linear in @xmath23 , the quark propagator in the @xmath25 representation",
    "is the following : @xmath26 the terms in the operator expansion which correspond to the nonperturbative interaction of the quarks with the axial field have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and have the following form : @xmath27 here ,  @xmath28 mev ,  @xmath29 mev)@xmath30 ,   @xmath31  gev@xmath32 is the parameter of the matrix element : @xmath33 which is defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath34 is the dual tensor of the gluon field strength . by means of expressions ( [ h7 ] ) , ( [ h8 ] ) , and using the technique developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we are able to determine the polarisation operator @xmath35 in the region @xmath36 gev@xmath37 . the actual calculation is carried through using the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) and taking into account several first low dimensional operators : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are coefficient functions .    in order to extract pion pole from the amplitude ( [ h1 ] ) we have to manage the case of small , but nonzero @xmath20 .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the case of small but nonzero @xmath20 , one may perform the calculation of the polarisation operator for @xmath40 and then , in the final expression , make the substitution : @xmath41 the calculation of the polarisation operator ( [ h3 ] ) by means of ope gives the right - hand , theoretical part of the sum rule . on the other side ,",
    "the polarisation operator satisfies the dispersion relations , which we shall saturate by the contribution of the intermediate states .",
    "the dispersion relations are : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the contribution in ( [ h3 ] ) of the diagonal transitions corresponding to the diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr1 ] ) , @xmath44 is the contribution of the non - diagonal transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath45 denotes the structure function of the polarisation operator @xmath46 that we use for the calculation of @xmath1 .    after saturating ( [ hh3 ] ) by resonances , taking into account @xmath47 resonance contributions explicitly , and taking care of higher exited states using continuum model @xcite",
    ", we obtain the phenomenological , left - hand part of the sum rule .",
    "apply now the ideas discussed above to the @xmath48 transition .    to begin with ,",
    "consider the phenomenological part .",
    "we saturate the currents ( [ h2 ] ) , ( [ hh2 ] ) by the physical resonances and define the residues : @xmath49 here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote masses and form - factors of @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons . @xmath52 and @xmath20 are the form - factor of @xmath10 meson in chiral limit and its momentum .",
    "the linear ( in @xmath17 ) part of the polarisation operator @xmath53 is proportional to the invariant amplitude ( [ h1 ] ) and is given by : @xmath54 @xmath55 the ... denote contributions of other exited states and `` parasitic '' non - diagonal pieces .",
    "taking limit @xmath56 and substituting ( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ h11 ] ) , into ( [ h12 ] ) we arrive to the expression for @xmath57 : @xmath58 in order to obtain ( [ h13 ] ) we used the well - known expression @xmath59 for the density matrix , we took into account @xmath60 , and we have written explicitly the contribution of the @xmath61 transition only .",
    "we need to consider the sum rule for the following structure : @xmath62 in the subsequent calculations of ope we keep only the terms that contain the structure ( [ h14 ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the left , theoretical part .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the operators of dimensions @xmath63 only .",
    "+ consider the unit operator , first .",
    "its contribution is given by one diagram of zero order in @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr3 ] ) and six diagrams of the first order in @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr4 ] ) .    the explicit calculation of the expression corresponding to the ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr3 ] ) gives zero .",
    "since the contribution of zero order to the unit operator @xmath65 vanishes , the @xmath64 corrections to this operator are taken into account .",
    "we shall do it because the contribution of this operator is potentially the leading one and even @xmath64 corrections due to the unit operator may give large contribution to the sum rule .",
    "the @xmath64 corrections are given by diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : gr4 ] and contain one gluon exchange .",
    "we calculate the expressions corresponding to all six diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr4 ] ) at zero momenta transfer .",
    "subsequently , we perform the substitution ( [ h9 ] ) and retain only the terms containing the structure ( [ h14 ] ) .",
    "the contribution of each diagram has the same structure : @xmath66 \\frac{q^{\\lambda}a_{\\lambda } } { q^2}\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}q^{\\alpha}p^{\\beta }   \\label{h16}\\ ] ] @xmath67    the obtained numerical factors @xmath68 s are listed below : @xmath69 the appearance of the @xmath70 term , of course , does not surprise .",
    "what is less obvious is a complete cancellation of all infrared divergencies that occur in the mass - less limit we are working in .",
    "this remarkable fact signifies the existence of ope and the fact that long and short distances are separated indeed . taking the sum",
    ", we obtain that the contribution of the unit operator to ope is given by : @xmath71 \\frac{q^{\\lambda}a_{\\lambda } } { q^2}\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}q^{\\alpha}p^{\\beta }   \\label{h17}\\ ] ] here the running coupling constant @xmath72 is given by : @xmath73 } \\label{h18}\\ ] ] @xmath74 denotes the cutoff of qcd and is taken to be 0.2 gev .",
    "next , let us calculate the power corrections to the sum rule . we take into account @xmath75 and @xmath76 condensates only . the contributions due to @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 are negligible and the operators with @xmath81 are omitted as well .",
