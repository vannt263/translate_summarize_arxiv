    "the @xmath5 processes @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which have potential astrophysical applications , are known to be highly suppressed due to the vector  axial vector nature of the weak interaction @xcite . for massless neutrinos , this suppression is such that the cross sections for the @xmath9 processes @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 exceed the @xmath5 cross sections for center of mass energies @xmath13 between 1 kev and 1 mev @xcite . while this range of energies is adequate for many astrophysical applications ,",
    "there are those , such as supernova dynamics , where the @xmath9 cross sections at higher energies are needed @xcite .",
    "energy @xmath9 cross sections can be calculated from an effective interaction @xcite , but these results become unreliable for energies on the order of @xmath3 . our purpose here is to compute these cross sections using the complete one  loop electron box amplitudes .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the relation between the low  energy description of @xmath10 and its crossed channels based on the effective interaction and the more exact numerical treatment of the full amplitude .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the numerical results and their possible applications .",
    "the appendix contains an expression for the photon ",
    "photon scattering scalar four  point function in the case when one of the photons is virtual .",
    "the @xmath9 process @xmath10 and its crossed channels can be calculated using the diagrams illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "when the center of mass energy is small compared to @xmath4 , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 propagators can be replaced by @xmath17 or @xmath18 . in this case , the diagrams reduce to those for photon - photon scattering with one photon polarization vector replaced by the neutrino current @xmath19 or its crossed channel counterparts .",
    "this reduction is illustrated in fig.2 for the various channels .    for low ",
    "energy scattering , it is possible to describe all @xmath9 processes using the effective local interaction @xcite @xmath20\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is @xmath22 here , @xmath23 includes both the @xmath15 and @xmath16 contributions .",
    "the dimension 10 operator @xmath24 is closely related to the euler  heisenberg lagrangian for photon - photon scattering @xcite and gives the leading term of an expansion in @xmath25 . the resulting low  energy cross section , @xmath26 exhibits a characteristic @xmath27 behavior for @xmath28 .",
    "the numerical factors @xmath29 are    @xmath30    when the center of mass energy exceeds @xmath31 , the box diagram develops an imaginary part and it is no longer possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the amplitude by expanding in inverse powers of @xmath3 . as long as the center of mass energy is small compared to @xmath4 , it is still possible to calculate the amplitude using the electron box diagrams of fig.2 by treating the neutrino current as a virtual photon . for the channels @xmath11 ( b ) and @xmath32 ( c ) ,",
    "the virtual photon is timelike , while the virtual photon in the channel @xmath10 ( a ) is spacelike . in all cases ,",
    "the diagrams can be expressed in terms of scalar two  point , three ",
    "point , and four  point functions and scalar products of external momenta , photon polarization vectors and the neutrino current @xcite .",
    "the scalar functions , which are expressible in terms of dilogarithms @xcite , were evaluated numerically using a fortran code developed for one  loop corrections @xcite .",
    "the exact cross sections for all @xmath9 channels as a function of the center of mass energy of one of the initial particles are shown in figs . 35 , together with the low ",
    "energy approximation , eq.([inelas ] ) . in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 cases , where the virtual photon is timelike",
    ", the low - energy result is valid up to energies @xmath33 .",
    "the deviation for a few higher energies is shown in table i. the ratio of the exact cross section to that given in eq .",
    "( [ inelas ] ) becomes unity at @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the @xmath36 and @xmath37 channels , respectively .",
    "below these crossover points the ratio for these channels is always larger than unity .",
    "consequently , the effective interaction can be used up to these energies to set lower bounds on physical effects .    for the remaining channel , @xmath10 , where the virtual photon is spacelike ,",
    "the agreement between the low  energy approximation and the complete calculation is good for energies as large as @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for this difference is related to the behavior of the amplitudes as the center of mass energy of the each initial particle approaches @xmath3 . for the timelike cases , which , in the context of virtual ( @xmath38 ) photon  photon scattering , correspond to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 is precisely the threshold for @xmath42 production .",
    "this is the source of the cusp at @xmath43 in figs.4 and 5 , which is preceded by a departure from the low  energy @xmath27 behavior . in the spacelike case ( @xmath44 )",
    ", the threshold for @xmath42 production requires @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy of the initial neutrino and @xmath47 is the energy of the final neutrino .",
    "when @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and there is essentially no phase space for this .",
    "thus , the development of an imaginary part for @xmath10 occurs for energies @xmath50 and the @xmath27 behavior persists to a higher value of @xmath51 . in this case ,",
    "ratio of the exact cross section to eq.([inelas ] ) is less than unity below @xmath52 , grows to 1.71 at @xmath53 and again becomes unity at @xmath54 .",
    "the other feature of figs.35 is the onset of an @xmath55 behavior once @xmath56 .",
    "this is expected since if @xmath57 , the only scale is @xmath4 or , equivalently , @xmath58 and hence the cross section should behave as @xmath59 .",
    "this behavior , together with the values @xmath60@xmath61 , @xmath62@xmath61 , and @xmath63@xmath61 at @xmath64 , allow accurate extrapolation to all higher energies much less than @xmath65 .",
    "as in the low  energy case @xcite , the final photons in the @xmath10 channel acquire circular polarization , which is characteristic of a parity violating interaction .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is illustrated in fig.6 , where the difference between the positive and negative helicity cross sections for one of the final photons is plotted relative to the total cross section .",
    "there is a reasonably large polarization , @xmath662030% , for center of mass energies @xmath67 .",
    "in addition to the total cross sections , we have investigated the energy and angular distribution of the final neutrino in the process @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution @xmath68 is shown in figs.7 and 8 for a variety of center of mass energies @xmath51 of the incident photon . in all cases , the distribution of final neutrino energies rises until the inequality eq.([thresh ] ) is no longer satisfied , at which point it rapidly drops .",
    "the evolution of the angular distribution @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the cosine of the neutrino scattering angle , is shown in figs.9 and 10 . at @xmath43 , the distribution is peaked in the backward direction and this gradually changes into a sharply forward peaked distribution at @xmath71 .",
    "the processes described here could affect supernovas at several stages of the explosion . work toward including these reactions in a supernova code is in progress .",
    "in addition , the scattering from infrared and optical backgrounds given by these processes could attenuate travel of high energy photons and neutrinos over cosmological distances .",
    "the cross sections are too small for significant scattering from cosmic backgrounds .",
    "finally , it has been noted that the effective interaction , eq.([l3gam ] ) , with one of the photons replaced by an external magnetic field could give enhanced stellar cooling in stars with strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a more exact calculation , along the lines of this paper , is under consideration .",
