    "the investigation of thermodynamic properties and phase structure of strongly interacting nuclear matter at high baryon densities and temperatures has recently become important in view of plans to construct new accelerator facilities ( fair ) at gsi darmstadt for covering the ( 5 - 35 ) agev heavy - ion energy range  @xcite .",
    "increasing interest to this energy region is emphasized by the recent proposal for a low - energy campaign at rhic aimed at identification of the critical end - point  @xcite and by current discussions about the feasibility for searching the quark - hadron mixed phase at the nuclotron - based collider ( jinr , dubna )  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions for critical baryon densities and temperatures of phase transitions depend sensitively on the equation of state ( eos ) of both the hadronic matter and the quark - gluon matter at high densities and temperatures in the nonperturbative regime . here",
    "we focus on studying the hadronic eos .",
    "an eos of hadronic matter should satisfy experimental information extracted from the description of global characteristics of atomic nuclei such as the saturation density , binding energy per particle , compressibility , asymmetry energy and some other .",
    "some constraints on hadronic models of eos follow from analysis of elliptical flow and @xmath8 data in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) .",
    "in addition to these constraints astrophysical bounds on the high - density behavior of @xmath9-equilibrium neutron star matter were applied in the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "obviously relativistic effects are important under extreme conditions of high densities and temperatures . microscopically based approaches , as the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock method , see @xcite , are very promising but need rather involved calculations .",
    "uncertainties are getting larger with increase of the baryon density and temperature .",
    "e.g. , three - body forces are to large extend unconstrained .",
    "their poorly - known isospin and temperature dependencies introduce additional sources of uncertainty . in the quark - meson - coupling models",
    "the nuclear system is represented as a collection of quark bags .",
    "the interactions are generated by the exchange of @xmath0- , @xmath10- and @xmath2-mesons treated on the mean - field level with quarks , for recent review see @xcite .",
    "these models might be especially useful for the study of the quark deconfinement phase transition .",
    "but they involve uncertainties due to phenomenological description of the nucleon structure . as a more economical approach for describing global properties of nuclear matter at the above extreme conditions the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach",
    "is often used where baryons interact with @xmath0 , @xmath10 and @xmath2 mean fields .",
    "parameters of the model are extracted from the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "first rmf models used a minimal coupling of nucleons with @xmath0 , @xmath10 and @xmath2 mesons @xcite .",
    "however it proved to be insufficient to appropriately describe experimental data",
    ". therefore non - linear self - interactions of the @xmath0 meson have been introduced , see @xcite .",
    "this approach was latter extended to meson fields @xcite . as an alternative ,",
    "rmf models with density dependent nucleon - meson couplings were developed @xcite .",
    "they allow a more flexible description of the medium dependence .",
    "many other extensions of the models have been considered , e.g. models including @xmath11 symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is not our goal here to study and compare different models with each other .",
    "most of the models were developed in order to describe a specific domain of nuclear physics .",
    "their validity in other regions of nuclear physics either was not considered or they failed to describe them . in ref .",
    "@xcite a general testing scheme was developed to apply the models to all known nuclear systems .",
    "it has been shown that among other phenomenological models studied there , the rmf model of the eos suggested in @xcite proved to be one of the most efficient model satisfying majority of the existing constraints at zero temperature ( see kvor eos in table 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore focusing on the further application to hic ,",
    "the given model will be generalized here to finite temperatures .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we assume a relevance of the ( partial ) chiral symmetry restoration at high baryon densities and/or temperatures  @xcite manifesting in form of the brown - rho scaling hypothesis @xcite : masses and coupling constants of all hadrons decrease with a density increase in approximately the same way .",
    "note that most of the models use the constant @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 effective masses .",
    "some models introduce field interaction terms leading to an increase of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 effective masses with the increasing nucleon density , e.g. @xcite .",
    "contrary , ref .",
    "@xcite follows the brown - rho scaling hypothesis and scales the quadratic ( mass ) terms of @xmath0 , @xmath10 and @xmath2 fields as well as the baryon mass by a universal scaling function @xmath12 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath12 is assumed to be dependent on the @xmath0 mean - field .",
    "this provides thermodynamical consistency of the model . in order to obtain a reasonable eos ,",
    "the meson - nucleon coupling constants should be also scaled with the @xmath0 mean field .",
    "differences in the scaling functions for the effective masses of @xmath10- and @xmath2-fields and their couplings to a nucleon allow one to get an appropriate density - dependent behavior of both the total energy and the nuclear asymmetry energy , in agreement with constrains obtained from measurements of neutron star masses and surface temperatures  @xcite .",
    "our main goal here is to construct some effective model of eos that would incorporate the decrease of hadron masses and couplings with increase of the baryon density @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 and , simultaneously , would fulfill various constraints known from analysis of atomic nuclei , neutron stars and hic .",
    "our consideration is based on the generalization of the kvor model  @xcite to finite temperatures .",
    "we aim to test its suitability to description of properties of hot and dense matter formed in hic .",
    "besides the nucleon and meson mean fields we include low - lying non - strange and strange baryon resonances ( @xmath3 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , meson excitations @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 constructed on the ground of mean fields , and the ( quasi)goldstone excitations @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",

    "all corresponding antiparticles are also included .",
    "all states are treated within quasiparticle approximation .",
    "we restrict ourselves by taking into account only the large @xmath32 ground states of baryons and mesons  @xcite .",
    "generalization to higher mass resonances is , of course , straightforward .",
    "however we will drop them from our consideration being guided by the following arguments : the next in mass state that does not enter the multiplet is the @xmath33 state .",
    "it manifests in the kaon scattering data as a quasimolecular state near the kaon - nucleon threshold .",
    "however in description of a broad kaon energy region under discussion in this work the @xmath33 hyperon does not manifest as a pole - like term @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented arguments that @xmath33 should dissolve in matter .",
    "thereby we will exclude @xmath33 from our study .",
    "moreover as it is conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite , higher mass baryon resonances can be understood as composite particles .",
    "their widths in matter are expected to be quite large . ref .",
    "@xcite reproduces particle scattering data assuming that the lowest baryon octet and decouplet are only relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore we do not incorporate the higher resonances within our quasiparticle model .",
    "besides , the higher mass particles are considered , the less they contribute to thermodynamics , and the less one knows about their interactions .",
    "following above argumentation and in order not to complicate consideration by introducing dependencies on unknown parameters we accordingly cut the baryon particle set .",
    "although free @xmath0- , @xmath2- , @xmath10-mesons are rather heavy , their effective masses in matter essentially decrease . therefore we include excitations of these fields as well . sometimes the @xmath34$]-meson is incorporated in the rmf scheme  @xcite .",
    "its role in rmf models is similar to that of the @xmath2-meson except that inclusion of @xmath35$]-meson allows for mass splitting between proton and neutron . since @xmath34",

    "the fermion - fermion hole loop diagrams for boson propagators and the boson - fermion loop diagrams for fermion propagators are disregarded .",
    "thereby we omit the @xmath37-wave pion - baryon and kaon - baryon interaction effects , though these effects are important in high - baryon density regime  @xcite . at high temperatures",
    "the fermion - antifermion loops in boson propagation and fermion - boson loops in boson propagation might become very important  @xcite .",
