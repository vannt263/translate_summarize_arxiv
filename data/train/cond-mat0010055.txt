    "the hopfield model has attracted interests of researchers in various fields , and enormous amount of studies , both numerical - experimental and theoretical , have been carried out on it . of particular interest among them is the one on the model with _ non - monotonic _",
    "units@xcite : whereas the conventional model uses , as the output function @xmath0 of a unit , monotonic functions such as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , the model with non - monotonic units , or the non - monotonic model for short , uses a non - monotonic function .",
    "it has been reported that the non - monotonic model has various nice properties as a model of associative memory , such as enhancement of storage capacity , enlargement of basins of attraction associated with retrieval states .    in order to rigorously argue such properties of the non - monotonic model ,",
    "theoretical analyses are necessary .",
    "however , attempts to analyze the non - monotonic model are often faced with difficulty because the non - monotonic model in general does not have a lyapunov function , which would be a powerful analytical tool for characterizing the equilibrium as well as dynamical properties of the model .",
    "thus , applicable theories are restricted to what have been devised for analyzing the conventional model and yet are independent of the functional form of the output function @xmath0 . as for equilibrium analysis ,",
    "the self - consistent signal - to - noise analysis ( scsna ) has been applied to the non - monotonic model@xcite and some interesting properties , including the existence of the so - called superretrieval states , have been found . for retrieval dynamics , on the other hand ,",
    "currently no exact and tractable theory has been known even for the conventional model : the path integral formalism@xcite and gardner - derrida - mottishaw theory@xcite ( for `` zero - temperature , '' or @xmath3 case ) are the exact theories for the asynchronous ( or glauber ) and synchronous ( or little ) dynamics , respectively , but computation of dynamics based on each of them is prohibitively difficult .",
    "it has been generally believed@xcite that any tractable theories on retrieval dynamics necessarily incorporate some approximation . for the conventional model with the synchronous dynamics , amari - maginu theory@xcite ( for zero - temperature case ; for extension to finite - temperature case , see @xcite ) has been proposed as one of such theories , and nishimori and opri@xcite have applied it to the non - monotonic case .",
    "as one of tractable theories for the conventional model with the asynchronous dynamics , coolen and sherrington@xcite have proposed the 2-parameter dynamical replica theory ( 2-drt hereafter ; it is also sometimes called the coolen - sherrington ( cs ) theory ) .",
    "of course it is an approximate theory , as confirmed , for example , by ozeki and nishimori@xcite and tanaka and osawa@xcite ; nevertheless , it describes retrieval dynamics of the conventional model reasonably well . as ozeki and",
    "nishimori@xcite have mentioned , formulation of 2-drt does not depend on the functional form of the output function @xmath0 , and therefore it is possible to apply it to the non - monotonic model .",
    "thus , the following question naturally arises : _ how well does 2-drt describe retrieval dynamics of the non - monotonic model ?",
    "_ in this paper , we address this problem , with emphasis placed on the storage capacity , size of basins of attraction , and the superretrieval states .",

    "path integral formalism@xcite provides an exact description to the retrieval dynamics , but it requires parametrization with infinite degrees of freedom and hence practically intractable .",
    "2-drt , proposed by coolen and sherrington@xcite , provides a tractable , and yet reasonably well for the conventional model , description of the retrieval dynamics .",
    "it uses two parameters , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as the order parameters , the latter being defined as @xmath47 which intuitively represents the degree of interferential effect of non - nominated patterns @xmath44 onto the retrieval of pattern 1 .",
    "2-drt derives deterministic flow equations for these two order parameters . without any assumptions",

    "self - averaging of flow equations with respect to randomness of the system ( randomly chosen patterns for the case treated in this paper ) .",
    "probability equipartitioning within subshells : when values of the order parameters are given , the probability distribution of the corresponding microscopic state can be regarded as being uniform over the subshell ( the set of microscopic states which have the specified values of the order parameters ) , with regard to calculation of the flow equations .    owing to these closing assumptions , one can derive the deterministic flow equations for @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath48\\;f(m+z)-m \\nonumber\\\\ & & { 1\\over2}{dr\\over dt } = { 1\\over\\alpha}\\int dz\\;d_{m,\\,r}[z]\\;zf(m+z)+1-r \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 $ ] is the distribution of the noise terms .",

    "this is the reason why , apart from validity of the two assumptions , 2-drt can be straightforwardly applied to the non - monotonic model .",
    "the latter of the two above - mentioned assumptions , the _ equipartitioning _ assumption , is a critical one because it has been known that it is not valid for the conventional model@xcite , as well as the continuous - valued linear system , or the langevin spin system@xcite . to show this directly for the conventional model , tanaka and osawa@xcite have proposed a dynamics , called ( @xmath45 , @xmath46)-annealing .",

    "it has been shown that the ( @xmath45 , @xmath46)-annealing executes monte carlo sampling from a ( @xmath45 , @xmath46)-subshell with uniform probability ( in the limit @xmath63 ) , hence realizing the equipartitioning .",
    "it is useful in investigating validity of the equipartitioning assumption , and will be utilized in this paper .",

    "we assume the common convention that initial microscopic states of the model are given by randomly corrupting the nominated pattern ; that is , the initial state @xmath65 is set by the probability law @xmath66=\\delta(s_i-\\xi_i^1)(1+m_0)/2 + \\delta(s_i+\\xi_i^1)(1-m_0)/2 $ ] , so that the initial overlap @xmath67 approximately equals to @xmath68 when @xmath4 is sufficiently large .",
    "following this initialization procedure , the initial value of @xmath46 , when @xmath4 is sufficiently large , approximately equals to @xmath69 .",
    "we found that 2-drt does describe the dynamics of the model considerably well , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] for the case with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "2-drt reproduced the trajectories almost exactly when retrieval succeeded .",
    "noticeable disagreement between simulations and 2-drt was seen for cases where retrieval failed .",
    "characteristic aspect of the disagreement is that the trajectories predicted by 2-drt exhibit , in early stages , overall slowing down against the corresponding simulations .",
    "these observations are essentially the same as those found in the conventional model@xcite . the observed disagreement is due to the failure of the equipartitioning assumption of 2-drt just as in the conventional model , as demonstrated by the following numerical experiment .",
    "the procedure of this experiment is as follows : simulate a model with @xmath71 and @xmath70 by setting its initial condition as @xmath72 , stop it at @xmath73 , and then execute the ( @xmath45 , @xmath46)-annealing for 80 units of time .",
    "the flow vectors @xmath74 , evaluated from ( 1 ) the model just before executing the ( @xmath45 , @xmath46)-annealing , ( 2 ) the model just after it , and ( 3 ) 2-drt , were compared , and the result is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fv ] .",
    "this shows that the flow vectors of the model after the ( @xmath45 , @xmath46)-annealing and of 2-drt are almost the same , whereas the flow vector before the ( @xmath45 , @xmath46)-annealing is different from these two , which means that the equipartitioning assumption does not hold in this case .      in this paper , we define the storage capacity @xmath75 as the maximum value of @xmath56 for which a stable macroscopic state with nonvanishing @xmath45 exists .",
    "we call an equilibrium macroscopic state with nonvanishing @xmath45 the retrieval state .",
    "since the retrieval state may be unstable , the condition for the existence of a retrieval state will give an overestimate of the true storage capacity . on the other hand , a stable retrieval state may have a very small basin of attraction , so that we may fail to find such a retrieval state in numerical experiments even though it is stable .",
    "shiino and fukai@xcite have analyzed equilibrium properties of continuous - valued continuous - time non - monotonic models using scsna .",
    "although we consider the model with binary variables in this paper rather than ones with continuous values , the equilibrium condition is shown to be the same as that for the continuous - value continuous - time model owing to the current choice of the output function @xmath0 ( eq .  ( [ eq : nonmono ] ) ) , and thus scsna can be applied to the model treated here .",
    "we executed the scsna calculation on this model , and fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] shows the result for @xmath76 , the maximum of @xmath56 for which a retrieval state exists , versus @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath77 , @xmath76 approaches the well - known value 0.138 , confirming that scsna is consistent with the amit - gutfreund - sompolinsky ( ags ) theory@xcite . as @xmath18 becomes smaller , @xmath76 increases so that it reaches its maximal value @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "as we have already discussed , @xmath76 gives an overestimation of the true storage capacity @xmath75@xcite . to evaluate @xmath75 itself",
    ", we have to take into account the dynamical aspect of the retrieval process .",
    "this discussion leads us to the idea to apply 2-drt to determine the storage capacity @xmath75 , by observing whether or not the trajectories from arbitrary initial conditions approach a retrieval state .",
    "two points have to be mentioned here .",
    "first , although 2-drt becomes exact at equilibrium for the conventional model@xcite , it is no longer so for the non - monotonic model , which means that 2-drt may not reproduce the storage capacity .",
    "second , since we assume the initialization procedure described above , only the retrieval states which can be reachable from initial conditions with @xmath80 are to be observed in the simulations . to make correspondence with this experimental setup , we estimated the storage capacity @xmath75 by tracking 2-drt trajectories from initial conditions with @xmath80 . the storage capacity estimated by the simulations and by the 2-drt trajectory tracking",
    "may be therefore an underestimate against the _ true _ storage capacity , because there might be stable retrieval states unreachable from any initial condition with @xmath80 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : sr ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pd - drt ] shows the estimated storage capacity @xmath75 by 2-drt trajectory tracking and by simulations .",
    "it can be seen that 2-drt trajectory tracking well reproduces the storage capacity obtained by the simulations for the whole range of @xmath18 . comparing it with fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] reveals that , while the agreement is good when @xmath18 is large , the discrepancy becomes apparent as @xmath18 becomes less than about @xmath81 , showing that the storage capacity estimated by 2-drt is considerably smaller than that estimated by scsna .",
    "it may be partly explained by the overestimation of scsna described above .",

    "we used 2-drt to evaluate the basin of attraction of the retrieval states .",
    "since we adopt the above - mentioned initialization convention , we consider the basin of attraction as being represented in terms of @xmath45 only , that is , we regard a value of @xmath68 as belonging to the basin of attraction of the retrieval state if the trajectory starting at the state @xmath84 approaches the retrieval state . evaluating the basin of attraction defines the critical initial overlap @xmath85 , which means that initial states @xmath86 with @xmath87 yield successful retrieval .",
    "figures  [ fig : basin ] and [ fig : retrieval - m ] show the critical initial overlap @xmath85 and the values of @xmath45 of the retrieval state , respectively , evaluated by 2-drt and by simulations .",
    "it is readily seen that enlargement of the basin of attraction occurs as @xmath18 becomes small , and that 2-drt captures this phenomenon reasonably well .      as a result of scsna analysis on non - monotonic models , shiino and fukai@xcite",
    "have shown that there is a phase where equilibrium states corresponding to `` perfect '' retrieval exist .",
    "such states are called the superretrieval states , whose existence is one of unique features of the non - monotonic models .",
    "here , `` perfect '' means that the correlation of the sign of the local field @xmath41 ( not of @xmath65 ) with the nominated pattern @xmath88 is exactly equal to @xmath28 . the correlation defined as above",
    "is called the tolerance overlap@xcite .",
    "the critical capacity @xmath89 , below which the superretrieval occurs , can be evaluated numerically by scsna , and is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "an explanation , given by shiino and fukai@xcite , for possibility of such states is briefly as follows : for such states @xmath90 holds , which has been confirmed by numerically solving relevant self - consistent equations .",
    "since variance of the noise term ( without the `` systematic '' term , @xmath91 , in their terminology@xcite ) is given by @xmath92 in scsna , it implies that the effect of the noise completely vanishes in the states , which enables the superretrieval .",
    "especially interesting is whether or not 2-drt provides an appropriate description of dynamics which is bound for superretrieval states . to see this",
    ", we examined the case where @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which , according to scsna analysis , is expected to have the superretrieval states .",
    "figure  [ fig : sr - r - t ] shows time evolution of @xmath46 evaluated by simulation and by 2-drt , with initial condition @xmath95 .",
    "again , 2-drt reproduced the simulation result fairly well .",
    "for the simulation , state transition ended ( confirmed numerically ) at @xmath96 , where @xmath97 .",
    "the tolerance overlap was evaluated to be exactly equal to @xmath69 at this state , indicating that this is the superretrieval state .",
    "figure  [ fig : sr - noise - dist ] shows the noise distribution @xmath98 $ ] at the equilibrium state achieved by the simulation , and the one computed by 2-drt for the same values of @xmath99 .",
    "they are in good agreement , suggesting that 2-drt can successfully predict the trajectories even in the case of superretrieval , provided that the system size @xmath4 is sufficiently large . as for 2-drt ,",
    "the value of @xmath46 continued to decrease at @xmath100 ( we stopped computation of 2-drt at @xmath101 because rounding errors became profound beyond this point ) , where @xmath102 .",
    "we observed numerically that @xmath64-dependence of the decrease of @xmath46 can be expressed , to a good approximation , as @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rt ] ) , which strongly supports the conjecture that the trajectory obtained by 2-drt certainly approaches @xmath104 . as can be seen by eq .",
    "( [ eq : csnoisedist ] ) , variance of the noise term is , roughly speaking , given by @xmath105 in 2-drt .",
    "then , if the superretrieval states are described appropriately by 2-drt , they should correspond to the states with @xmath106 .",
    "we therefore investigate in the following the solutions of the saddle - point equations ( [ eq : cs - speq ] ) when @xmath106 .    by formally taking the limit @xmath107 , the saddle - point equations ( [ eq : cs - speq ] ) are reduced to the following equations @xmath108 and ,",
    "correspondingly , the rs noise distribution @xmath109 $ ] ( [ eq : csnoisedist ] ) becomes @xmath110={1-m\\over2}\\delta(z-\\alpha ) + { 1+m\\over2}\\delta(z+\\alpha).\\ ] ] the condition that the macroscopic state @xmath111 is an equilibrium state , that is , @xmath112 holds , is thus given by @xmath113 for the current choice of the function @xmath0 ( eq .

    "this is in consistent with the observation from the simulations that @xmath45 tends to approach @xmath18 when the superretrieval occurs .",
    "the applicability of the argument above depends not only on the two assumptions made at the beginning but also on the two following points : the first one concerns the so - called freezing line , which defines the points in the @xmath99 plane where the number of microscopic states within the @xmath99-subshell changes from an exponentially large number to an exponentially small number in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "the second one concerns the so - called de almeida - thouless ( at ) line@xcite , at which the replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) occurs and thus the rs ansatz becomes no longer valid .",
    "the freezing line is given , under the rs ansatz , by the following equation@xcite : @xmath116-\\mu m -{\\alpha\\over2}\\left[\\ln[1-\\rho(1-q ) ] + { \\rho(1-q)(1-\\rho+3q\\rho)\\over[1-\\rho(1-q)]^2}\\right]+\\ln2=0 \\label{eq : freeze}\\ ] ] the number of microscopic states within the subshell is exponentially large , and therefore taking averages over the subshell is expected to have the proper meaning , as long as the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : freeze ] ) is positive . for @xmath80 and @xmath117",
    "the left - hand side becomes @xmath118>0,\\ ] ] so that the number of microscopic states is indeed exponentially large .",
    "in the limit @xmath107 , however , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : freeze ] ) goes to @xmath119 , implying that @xmath104 is outside the freezing line .",
    "this means that there are so few microscopic states near @xmath104 , which may in part explain the observation from the simulations that the trajectories approaching @xmath104 reach equilibrium before actually arriving at @xmath104 . that @xmath104 is outside the freezing line also means that the argument with the formal limit @xmath107 eventually loses its proper meaning , because the relevant subshell average is over an _ exponentially small _ number of microscopic states . numerical evaluation reveals , however , that the freezing line for @xmath120 lies very close to @xmath104 ( fig .",

    "the at line is determined by examining stability of the rs solution .",
    "assuming that rsb is caused by destabilization of the so - called `` replicon '' modes@xcite for the case @xmath120 just as it has been assumed for the case @xmath126@xcite , the at line turns out to be given by the same formula as given in @xcite for @xmath126 : @xmath127 the rs solution is valid if the right - hand side of eq .",

    "we confirmed that , for the case where @xmath94 , the at line lies in the region @xmath128 for @xmath120 ( fig .",

    "the result of the analysis states that , among the superretrieval solutions , @xmath129 is the only attractor when @xmath130 , although it becomes unstable when @xmath131 . for the details of the local stability analysis , see appendix . in the simulations , however , it is not for all @xmath132 values satisfying @xmath130 that the superretrieval was observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : regs ] shows the region where the local stability analysis of the 2-drt predicts the stable superretrieval state , the one where the superretrieval is observed by simulations ( in the sense that tolerance overlap is numerically evaluated to be 1 ) , and the one where the superretrieval is predicted by tracking the 2-drt trajectories starting at @xmath84 .",
    "the result of 2-drt trajectory tracking and that of simulations are in good agreement with each other . both are within the region where the superretrieval state is locally stable , as they should be , but apparently they do not coincide .",
    "the region where the superretrieval is observed in simulations may be further restricted by the following factors :    * the superretrieval solution @xmath129 may not be reachable from the conventional initial states with @xmath80 , even though it is an attractor .",
