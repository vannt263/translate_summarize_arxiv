    "experiments have been carried out to validate and use such expressions to extract useful information in different physical and biological systems @xcite .",
    "a new fluctuation theorem for dissipative systems has been derived by seifert @xcite , which is based on the generalization of the concept of entropy production to the level of a single trajectory . the overall entropy production , namely the sum of the contributions from the environment and the one from the particle along its trajectory , is shown to obey an integral fluctuation relation ( and in some cases a detailed one ) for any initial conditions , arbitrary driving and over a generic finite time interval .",
    "moreover , recent experiments have validated this theorem @xcite and the stochastic entropy production has been measured experimentally for the first time @xcite .",
    "in this work , we consider a brownian particle moving on a periodic potential under the action of an external constant force .",
    "such system allows us to carry out a detailed study of the total entropy production and assess carefully the implications of seifert s fluctuation theorem . after a summary of the main results of ref .",

    "in ref . @xcite the dynamics of one degree of freedom @xmath0 such as the position of a particle in a one dimensional system is studied .",
    "it evolves according to a langevin equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a gaussian white noise with autocorrelation @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the diffusion constant so that in equilibrium @xmath5 .",
    "we consider @xmath6 throughout this work .",
    "the force @xmath7 splits into a term arising from a conservative potential , @xmath8 , plus a time dependent external source , @xmath9 , whose control parameter is @xmath10 .",
    "the non - equilibrium gibbs entropy , @xmath11 can be interpreted as a mean over single trajectories as specified by the probability @xmath12 of finding the particle at position @xmath0 at time @xmath13 .",

    "therefore , it is possible to write down the rate of change of total entropy associated with a single trajectory or realization as @xmath16 where we have introduced the particle flux , which for the langevin dynamics we are considering is given by @xmath17    in the spirit of previous fluctuation theorems , which relate the weights of trajectories with their time reversed counterparts , seifert introduces the quantity @xmath18 , @xmath19 \\equiv   \\ln \\frac { p[x(t)|x_{0 } ] p_{0}(x_{0 } ) } { \\tilde{p}[\\tilde{x}(t)|\\tilde{x}_{0 } ] p_{1}(\\tilde{x}_{0 } ) } , \\ ] ] which relates the weight of a trajectory with its time reversed analogue .",

    "let us consider a one dimensional stochastic system in which a particle is moving in a periodic potential @xmath8 and under an external force @xmath37 ( so that we restrict the general driving to the simplest case of constant driving in time and space , @xmath38 ) .",

    "( [ rsplit ] ) , is the entropy change of the particle @xmath84 along the stochastic trajectory . on physical grounds ,",
    "it is fruitful to write @xmath85 so that three different physical sources contribute to the change in the overall entropy of the system .",
    "the total entropy change @xmath18 has contributions from the medium and from the system itself , namely , the total heat dissipated @xmath80 ( which comes both from the external forcing and the change of internal energy ) and the entropy change associated to the change in the system s internal state , @xmath84 .    as presented in fig .",
    "( [ split ] ) , for the simple model under scrutiny it is possible to study each probability distribution function of the different contributions separately . obviously , although @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "one can see that the structure of the probability distribution function @xmath88 , whose contribution is directly the external force , has no internal structure and is simply characterized by a broad , slightly tilted , peak which moves to higher values of @xmath89 as time increases .",

    "since the term associated to the external force takes increasing values , it is clear that the contributions from the periodic potential to the entropy change will have a restricted effect on the overall @xmath68 .",
    "nevertheless , the potential is the responsible for the peaked structure in @xmath68 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath84 is qualitatively analogous to that of @xmath92 .",

    "therefore , the probability distribution function of @xmath18 moves towards positive values as time goes by .",

    "one can clearly see that only for the steady state initial ensemble the detailed fluctuation theorem holds .",
    "it is worthy to stress this point to prevent confusions and errors when applying the predictions provided by the theorem in real experiments , in which one should have careful control on the preparation of the initial state of the system .",
    "it would be interesting , although more tedious , to test the predictions derived from the fluctuation theorem away from the steady state , in which no simple expression such as eq .",

    "( [ eq : flux_diff ] ) , which makes it possible to express the housekeeping heat in terms of the external driving and the particle flux as @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath108 , the mean heat produced can be rewritten in the suggestive form @xmath109 which implies that the mean total entropy change can be simply expressed in terms of the mean work produced and dissipated by the driving force , @xmath110 , as @xmath111 we can derive an explicit expression for the mean velocity of the particle   @xcite @xmath112 remember that @xmath113 . again , for the potential @xmath8 given by eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) with @xmath63 , one gets , after some integrations , @xmath114 note that the mean velocity could be recasted in terms of an effective mobility @xmath115 , which would depend on the applied force , so that @xmath116 , for small forces , @xmath117 which would correspond to the free diffusion of a brownian particle in the periodic potential , and for asymptotically large forces , @xmath115 reduces to the bare mobility , @xmath118 , in scaled units .    finally , coming back to the mean entropy production , the following analytical expression is then encountered , @xmath119 where @xmath120 . in fig .",

    "as a result , for short times and for typical energies of the system comparable to the thermal energy , negative values of @xmath18 will be observable , corresponding to the so - called `` transient violations of the second law '' .",
    "these violations contribute significantly to the averages at the same time that determine the tails of the distributions , which are crucial when examining the detailed fluctuation relation .",

    "the inset shows that at long times @xmath18 is positive and increases . upon averaging over a number of independent trajectories , the linear increase predicted in the previous section",

    "this , together with the energy scale , sets the regime where examining `` transient violations '' becomes impractical .",
    "we have considered a simple system in a nonequilibrium steady state and have studied in detail many of the predictions and consequences derived from the fluctuation theorem in ref .",
    "in particular , by choosing an appropriate periodic potential , we have been able to find an explicit analytical and physically meaningful expression for the total entropy production along a stochastic trajectory . advantage has been taken from the fact that only initial and final positions for each trajectory are relevant , being a potential useful feature in future experiments .",
