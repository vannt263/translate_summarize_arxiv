    "in this paper we discuss a mapping between classical and quantum systems that lets us regard quantum dynamics as a generalization of finite state classical dynamics , and that allows us to identify equivalent quantities and concepts in classical and quantum systems .",
    "a similar mapping has long been known in statistical mechanics @xcite that establishes classical lattice models and their combinatorial entropy as simple examples of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "there is an obvious candidate for the comparable dynamical mapping : classical computations are equivalent to a subset of quantum computations @xcite .",
    "most work on quantum computation is , however , based on hybrid classical / quantum models in which macroscopic classical operations control the sequencing of quantum operations .",
    "such systems do not provide a purely quantum target for a classical / quantum mapping . instead , early work showing that autonomous quantum systems can perform classical computation @xcite forms the basis for the dynamical mapping presented here .",
    "this mapping allows physical quantities such as energy and momentum to be identified with finite - state classical quantities , with the aid of classical interpolation theory .",
    "related issues are addressed in @xcite , but a general dynamical mapping is not provided there .    as a preliminary to discussing dynamics",
    "we first review a canonical method for mapping classical lattice models onto quantum lattice models in statistical mechanics .",
    "in statistical mechanics , it is well known that classical lattice models can be recast as quantum models , with distinct classical configurations identified with orthogonal basis states @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the well known ferromagnetic 2d ising model . in this model",
    "each of @xmath0 lattice sites in a square lattice is occupied by a classical two - state `` spin , '' and each state @xmath1 of the @xmath2 possible configurations of the lattice is assigned a classical configurational energy @xmath3 that depends only on how many pairs of adjacent lattice sites have the same spin value and how many have opposite values .",
    "a quantum lattice model corresponding to such a classical lattice model can be constructed by identifying each of the @xmath4 distinct classical states @xmath1 with a distinct basis vector @xmath5 in an @xmath4 dimensional hilbert space . a hamiltonian operator @xmath6 is defined by taking each configuration state @xmath5 to be an energy eigenstate of @xmath6 with energy eigenvalue @xmath7 : @xmath8    in quantum statistical mechanics the energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of the density operator @xmath9 , with eigenvalues that give the statistical weight to attach to each energy eigenstate . for example , for a canonical ensemble of quantum mechanical systems",
    ", @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath10 . from ( [ eq.eclassical ] ) this becomes the usual classical boltzmann factor when applied to a configuration state @xmath5 , and quantum statistical mechanics reduces to classical .",
    "since the definition of @xmath6 used in the statistical mechanics mapping makes each classical configuration a time - invariant state under unitary time evolution , we use a different definition of @xmath6 to emulate classical dynamics .",

    "perfect digital degrees of freedom are updated at discrete times according to a sequence of invertible transformations .",
    "the total amount of state in the system , including that used to define the dynamics , is finite .",
    "here we take the time between update events to always be @xmath11 , so that the system is updated at the constant rate @xmath12 .",

    "this is in fact the smallest energy allowed by quantum distinguishability bounds , assuming the ground state energy of a much larger system encompassing this one sets the zero of the energy scale @xcite . adding @xmath34 makes the average energy ( [ eq.en ] ) independent of @xmath35 , @xmath36 this is the least possible average energy compatible with a dynamics that traverses distinct states at the average rate @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "so for simplicity we will revert to taking @xmath39 in the remainder of the discussion .",
    "we have provided a prescription for constructing a continuous - time quantum hamiltonian description for any invertible classical finite - state dynamics  turning discrete - time models into continuous - time models .",

    "@xmath50 is a periodic version of the @xmath51 function @xcite , which is the foundation of bandlimited interpolation theory : @xmath52 for integer values of @xmath53 that equal 0 modulo @xmath4 and @xmath54 for other integer values of @xmath53 .",

    "using @xmath64 , @xmath59 is also given by @xmath65    this is obviously true at the @xmath4 sample times @xmath66 and so it must be true at all times , since @xmath67 is composed of the same frequency components as @xmath59 , and the @xmath4 coefficients @xmath63 are completely determined by the values of @xmath59 at the @xmath4 sample times @xmath66 ( in fact , the @xmath63 s are the fourier transform of the @xmath68 s ) . if the lowest frequency is @xmath69 rather than zero , use @xmath70 instead of @xmath50 above .",
    "thus ( [ eq.t - from - n ] ) can be regarded as an exact reconstruction of a continuous but bandlimited dynamics in hilbert space from @xmath14 samples .",
    "the bandlimit on the energy spectrum erases the distinction between continuous - time and discrete - time dynamics ( and field operators @xcite ) , since a bandlimited periodic function is completely determined by a finite number of sample points .",
    "if @xmath71 has the same period and bandwidth as @xmath59 ( perhaps with a different lowest frequency ) then ( [ eq.n - samples ] ) implies @xmath72 and so a bandlimit also erases some of the distinction between continuous and discrete analysis of the dynamics .",
    "rather than just have integer time states of a classical finite - state dynamics correspond to integer time states of a quantum finite - energy dynamics , we can also extend the classical finite - state dynamics to intermediate times and have the two systems be isomorphic at all times .      in classical finite - state lattice dynamics",
    "it is often useful to imagine that , when a 1 representing a particle hops from one lattice site to another , it moves continuously in between .",
    "this extension of the dynamics allows us to extend classical - mechanical conservations associated with continuous spatial symmetries to discrete particle motion in order to define , for example , momentum conserving lattice gases .",
    "continuously extended lattice dynamics have a continuous evolution in both time and space but , at every moment , only a finite amount of state : if there are @xmath18 spots in space that can have a 1 or not at integer times , there are still only @xmath18 spots that can at non - integer times .",
    "since these @xmath18 bits do nt change their values while they re moving between integer locations , the non - integer - time states are really just a fixed sequence of rearrangements of the bits of the integer - time state .",
    "these extra intermediate states are distinct classically since the bits are in different places but they are redundant informationally .    note that a continuously extended lattice dynamics can still be described as a repeated cycle of local updates , but in this case each update moves a bit only infinitesimally .",
    "after any finite interval of time all of the bits will have moved by equivalent amounts .      in a continuously extended classical lattice dynamics ,",
    "any unit - time separated sequence of states provides a complete description of the logical dynamics : since the bits of state do nt change between integer times , exactly when we sample them does nt matter .",
    "similarly , any unit - time separated sequence of states from the continuous unitary evolution ( [ eq.continuous-t ] ) constitute a complete orthonormal basis set , since ( [ eq.t - from - n ] ) implies @xmath73 thus we are free to define a distinguished basis at any time @xmath42 consisting of the unit - time separated set of @xmath14 states from the evolution ( [ eq.continuous-t ] ) that includes the current state @xmath44 .",
    "if we identify these basis states with corresponding unit - time separated classical configurations , then the classical and quantum dynamics are isomorphic at all times .    in analyzing finite - state dynamics , the @xmath44 s act much like a complete continuous basis since , again from ( [ eq.t - from - n ] ) , @xmath74 moreover , the inner product ( [ eq.tt-inner ] ) acts like a dirac delta function in an integral with a bandlimited function @xmath59 . from ( [ eq.int=sum ] ) , @xmath75",
    "the continuously extended isomorphism can be used to compute average values for operators , such as momentum , defined on continuous sets of configurations .",
    "rather than use @xmath14 orthonormal quantum states to describe a classical orbit with @xmath14 informationally distinct configurations , it is sometimes convenient to use more . in the continuous - basis limit",
    "this yields a continuous - hamiltonian description .",
    "suppose that , starting with a classical finite - state dynamics , we add @xmath76 redundant intermediate - time states in the unit interval between each pair of consecutive integer - time states .",
    "each orbit @xmath13 of the corresponding quantum dynamics ( generated by the hamiltonian @xmath77 ) now visits @xmath78 basis states rather than just the @xmath14 of the original dynamics ( generated by @xmath79 ) , and the state of the new @xmath77 dynamics at a continuous moment of time becomes , from ( [ eq.t - from - n ] ) , @xmath80 where the basis state @xmath81 has been labeled by the time @xmath82 when it is reached in an evolution starting from @xmath83 . since this extended dynamics traverses distinct states at a rate @xmath84 that is @xmath0 times the original rate @xmath37 , it has @xmath0 times the average energy .",
    "as the number of intermediate states added in a fixed time period goes to infinity , the hamiltonian @xmath77 approaches a continuous hamiltonian @xmath85 and the average energy of the state @xmath86 goes to infinity .      by putting a bandlimit on the energy spectrum of the configuration basis states we can make the @xmath77 dynamics isomorphic to the original @xmath79 dynamics , with the same average energy : a bandlimit on energy can correct for an oversampling of the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "the fourier transform relationship ( [ eq.em ] ) between energy eigenstates and configurational basis states is left unchanged but we construct , in addition , a new set of bandlimited configurations @xmath87 which are the fourier transforms of the lowest @xmath14 energy eigenstates of @xmath77 , @xmath88 with @xmath18 an integer .",
    "these states constitute an orthonormal basis for bandlimited superpositions of configurations .",
    "they have the same average energy as the configuration basis states of the @xmath79 dynamics : the amount of time @xmath35 taken for one period of the orbit is being kept constant , and so from ( [ eq.eigen ] ) the first @xmath14 energy eigenvalues @xmath31 of @xmath77 are the same as for @xmath79 .",
    "the continuous time states @xmath89 that evolve from @xmath90 are given by ( [ eq.cutoff-n ] ) with @xmath18 replaced by @xmath42 . as in ( [ eq.t - from - n ] ) they obey @xmath91 so the evolution of bandlimited states is isomorphic with that of @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , from ( [ eq.cutoff-n ] ) with @xmath92 and expressing @xmath93 in terms of the @xmath78 configurational basis states using ( [ eq.em ] ) ,    [ eq.cutoff-t ] _ n_d = 1_k=0^m n_d-1 s(n_d ,- t ) + [ eq.many-bases ] = 1_m=0^m-1 _ n=0^n_d-1 s(n_d , n+-t ) & .",
    "the bandlimited state is , at all times , an equally weighted superposition of @xmath0 equivalent states , each of which corresponds to the extended classical configuration at time @xmath42 represented in a different unit - time separated basis .",
    "thus the correspondence of @xmath89 to classical configurations is the same as for @xmath44 .",
    "the state ( [ eq.cutoff-t ] ) is a sum over configurations separated in time by @xmath94 .",
    "if we normalize each configuration state to length @xmath95 instead of to length 1 , this becomes delta - function normalization in the limit @xmath96 and    [ eq.cutoff-t-lim ] _",
    "n_d = _ 0^t_d du s(n_d , u - t ) .    from this and ( [ eq.tt-inner ] ) , @xmath97 and",
    "so we can use the isomorphic @xmath44 states to determine amplitudes in the continuous configuration basis .",
    "a classical finite - state lattice dynamics is naturally described as a repeating sequence of invertible gate operations @xcite . in mapping this onto a quantum dynamics , the classical model can be implemented isomorphically as a sequence of local unitary operations .",
    "fundamental physics is , however , normally described as particle dynamics . to make contact with this viewpoint we can recast finite - state lattice dynamics as particle mechanics , _ following the motions of individual 1 s as if they were distinguishable particles_.      consider a classical lattice dynamics in which a single particle , represented by a 1 , hops in the @xmath98 direction from lattice site to adjacent lattice site at a constant rate , with average speed @xmath99 .",
    "the motion is periodic in space , traversing @xmath4 lattice sites in a distance @xmath100 before repeating . at @xmath101",
    "the particle is at @xmath102 .    for this classical evolution",
    ", we can take the state of the system to be the integer position @xmath18 of the 1 at integer time @xmath18 . in an isomorphic @xmath79 quantum evolution ,",
    "the distinct classical configurations become integer - position basis states @xmath5 . from (",
    "[ eq.t - from - n ] ) we get a description of intermediate configurations in terms of integer - time ones , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the configuration obtained by evolving for a time @xmath105 from the configuration @xmath106 .",
    "we identify the non - integer @xmath104 with the non - integer positions of the continuously extended dynamics .    in the quantum description of a classical particle at a non - integer position @xmath107 modulo @xmath100 ,",
    "there is some amplitude for the particle at more than one integer position . from ( [ eq.tt-inner ] ) and using ( [ eq.iso-equiv ] ) we can interpret @xmath108 to be the amplitude to find the particle at any continuous position @xmath109 at time @xmath42 , and compute the average momentum directly from @xmath110 .",
    "alternatively , we can instead start with an infinite - dimensional quantum hamiltonian that generates a continuous shift in space in the @xmath98 direction at speed @xmath111 : @xmath112 the direction of the shift is apparent from noting that @xmath113 implies @xmath114 .",
    "direction we would use @xmath115 instead . to represent the direction explicitly in the state we would multiply it by @xmath116 or @xmath117 and let @xmath118 . ]",
    "now we can make this dynamics isomorphic to the @xmath79 discrete shift by bandlimiting the initial state so that the evolution only traverses @xmath4 distinct states in the width @xmath100 .",
    "then from ( [ eq.cutoff-t-lim ] ) the state corresponding to a classical particle at position @xmath107 in the position basis is @xmath119 , with energy @xmath120 just as in @xmath79 . from ( [ eq.h - infty ] ) , @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "the state @xmath123 achieves a general bound @xmath124 on the average separation of distinct states of a moving particle @xcite .    since this description applies to any particle shifting uniformly in a lattice dynamics , ( [ eq.p ] )",
    "gives the corresponding momentum .",
    "of course only lattice update operations that actually move a particle contribute to the shift - energy @xmath125 portion of its total energy .      we can often consider a classical lattice - gas dynamics to be a discrete - time sampling of an idealized classical - mechanical particle dynamics @xcite that obeys hamilton s equations , @xmath126 to make the lattice dynamics run faster by a factor @xmath127 we reduce the interval between the discrete events , @xmath128 . from ( [ eq.hamiltons ] ) , this can be accomplished by letting @xmath129 , which is exactly the energy scaling required by ( [ eq.e ] ) .",
    "we ca nt just rescale @xmath11 arbitrarily while keeping the @xmath130 s and @xmath131 s unchanged , however , because particle velocities are limited by the speed of light .",
    "we can , instead , run the dynamics faster by putting the discrete events closer together in both time and space , leaving velocities unchanged . if the distance between events @xmath132 , then the scale of the @xmath130 s must be multiplied by @xmath127 to get an overall scaling of @xmath133 by @xmath127 in ( [ eq.hamiltons ] ) .",
    "this is exactly the momentum scaling required by ( [ eq.p ] ) .",
    "treating 1 s in a classical finite - state lattice dynamics as distinguishable particles  and keeping track of the discrete position and velocity of each 1dramatically over - represents the number of distinct states : all states with the same spatial pattern of 1 s and velocities correspond to a single state of the original lattice model .",
    "we can fix this over - representation in a quantum description of the distinghishable particle dynamics by merging equivalent states , adding them together to form new _ occupation number _ basis states , and using only these to describe the evolution .",
    "if we antisymmetrize each sum under particle interchange , the new basis states will each have at most one 1 with a given position and velocity  we can symmetrize instead to allow more @xcite .    to describe a dynamics in which the number of ones changes with time",
    ", we can use creation and annihilation operators to add and remove particles from the state , while maintaining symmetrization .",
    "these field operators inherit fermionic or bosonic commutation rules from the symmetrization .",
    "as we see from ( [ eq.interpol-x ] ) ( or from ( [ eq.t - from - n - n ] ) for @xmath85 ) , a finite set of bandlimited basis states allows a particle to be added centered at any continuous position in space . in one dimension with one velocity , for example , the creation operator @xmath134 for any @xmath109 is a superposition of the creation operators @xmath135 for integer positions @xmath18 , @xmath136    of course nothing essential is gained by using a continuous space and time description , since a bandlimited continuous state is completely determined by its values at discrete positions and times .",
    "similarly , nothing essential is gained by introducing fermionic field operators : there would be no need to maintain the antisymmetry of equivalent states if the original dynamics were described isomorphically in terms of local unitary operations .",
    "the particle described by ( [ eq.psi ] ) moves at a constant speed and is localized to a single position basis state of a finite - dimensional basis at all times ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) . this in no way conflicts with the uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics , which can be regarded as bounds on representing information using limited bandwidth .",
    "constraints on time or position determine the minimum width of the energy or momentum eigenfrequency distribution needed to describe a state that meets the constraints . in the usual uncertainty bounds we also associate a width with the time or position amplitude distribution @xcite , but in general other constraints on time or position can be used to determine a minimum width of energy or momentum eigenfrequencies .",
    "for example , suppose we have an exactly periodic evolution with period @xmath60 .",
    "the state at time @xmath42 can be written @xmath137 exact periodicity requires that each @xmath138 be an integer multiple of @xmath61 .",
    "if this evolution passes through @xmath4 mutually orthogonal states , then the superposition must involve at least @xmath4 different @xmath139 s ( since you ca nt construct @xmath4 distinct states out of fewer than @xmath4 distinct states ) .",
    "moreover , there must also be at least @xmath4 distinct frequencies ( since groups of @xmath139 s with the same frequency act like a single eigenstate in the construction ) . to have @xmath4 distinct frequencies that are integer multiples of @xmath61 , the bandwidth @xmath140 ( highest frequency in the superposition minus lowest ) must obey @xmath141 this is a version of the bandwidth - time theorem of communication theory @xcite .",
    "if we let @xmath142 be the average time between distinct states , we see that this is also a version of the time - energy uncertainty relation , using @xmath140 directly rather than some other measure of the width of the energy eigenfrequency distribution .",
    "the definition ( [ eq.inv-trans ] ) achieves this bound .      in constructing uncertainty bounds , the standard deviation of the eigenfrequency distribution",
    "is traditionally chosen to measure its width .",
    "this choice reflects both familiarity from statistics and ( for position and momentum ) a simple connection between the commutation relation and the standard - deviation bound @xcite .",
    "this choice is often divergent , however , and so fails to provide a useful bound @xcite .",
    "this is true in our case .",
    "consider the bandlimited state @xmath143 centered at @xmath144 .",
    "limiting ourselves to spatial frequencies @xmath145 with @xmath22 ranging from 0 to @xmath146 , this state has the least possible information about what the momentum is , since all momentum eigenstates in the allowed range have equal amplitude .",
    "correspondingly we might expect the position to be as well - defined as possible , given the limited bandwidth .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig.prob-dist ] that the position localization of the probability distribution @xmath147 is similar to that of a gaussian ( dotted line ) .",
    "this is not apparent in the mean square position deviation , however , which can be estimated for large @xmath4 using ( [ eq.sinc-limit ] ) as @xmath148 which diverges as @xmath149 ( _ i.e. , _ on an infinitely wide space ) .",
    "is near the middle of the periodic space , then the wavefunction goes to 0 at the boundary as @xmath149 and so the usual uncertainty relations apply ( * ? ? ?",
    "] thus @xmath150 , which is perfectly distinct from a unit shift of itself , is not localized at all on the infinite line if we use the traditional second - moment measure of the width of the distribution .",
    "the unit - height gaussian , which looks so similar in the figure , has a mean square deviation of @xmath151 .",
    "other measures of the width have been proposed that avoid this disparity @xcite .      for our purposes , a much better measure of the width of the eigenfrequency distribution",
    "is twice the average half - width : @xmath152 . here",
    "@xmath153 is the average frequency ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath154 ) and @xmath155 the lowest frequency used ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath156 ) . in general @xcite ,",
    "@xmath157 where @xmath158 is the minimum bandwidth compatible with the temporal or spatial constraints on the system .",
    "for example , if @xmath159 is the minimum separation in time between two mutually orthogonal states in the evolution , then the minimum bandwidth needed is @xmath160 : there must be at least two distinct frequencies and they must be separated by at least half of @xmath161 .",
    "the @xmath160 bound ( [ eq.av-min ] ) is only achieved by the energy ( [ eq.en ] ) for @xmath162 . for @xmath163 ,",
    "the energy ( [ eq.en ] ) is about twice as great as allowed by this bound .",
    "there is , however , the additional bandwidth constraint ( [ eq.b ] ) required to have @xmath4 distinct states in period @xmath60 . the energy ( [ eq.en ] ) achieves ( [ eq.av-min ] ) with this constraint .",
    "we have seen examples where a quantum hamiltonian describes a classical finite - state dynamics , but also makes extra distinctions not present in the original dynamics : a many particle hamiltonian that keeps track of which identical 1-bit is where . a continuous - shift hamiltonian that adds distinct states between the discrete time steps .",
    "we can eliminate over - representation and make the dynamics isomorphic to the original by adding together equivalent configurations with equal weight to construct truly distinct basis states .",
    "starting from these , equivalent configurations will always have equal probability : _ equivalence is represented as uncertainty_.    in the construction of the occupation number basis states for identical 1-bits , a symmetrized or antisymmetrized state represents equivalent states as being equally probable . in the case of over - representation of intermediate states , constructing a basis without the high frequency information needed to represent intermediate details also merges equivalent states ( [ eq.cutoff-t ] ) , making them equally probable .",
    "the continuous - hamiltonian representation of a discrete shift is an interesting limiting case of representing equivalence as uncertainty . a bandlimit with @xmath4 distinct states yields ( [ eq.many-bases ] ) for finite @xmath0 . for a state centered at @xmath105 and @xmath96",
    "this becomes @xmath164 which is a uniform superposition of all the equivalent ways to represent a classical particle at position @xmath109 if only @xmath4 equally - spaced positions are distinct .",
    "the tradeoff between bandwidth and minimum separation in space determines the minimum uncertainty volume of phase space needed to represent each distinct state , , momentum eigenfrequencies must be integer multiples of @xmath165 . thus to represent @xmath4 distinct states a bandwidth @xmath166 is needed , and so the frequency - space volume per distinct state is @xmath167 ( uncertainty tradeoff for @xmath140 vs. @xmath168 ) . ] and this is achieved by @xmath169 .",
    "classical finite - state dynamics that are invertible can be mapped isomorphically onto the discrete time behavior of finite - energy quantum dynamics .",
    "a quantum evolution mapping an infinite number of distinct states into a finite time period would have an infinite average energy .",
    "quantum - classical isomorphism challenges conventional wisdom about essential differences between quantum and classical systems : identical particles , amplitudes , frequencies , complementarity and uncertainty all play essential roles in describing and analyzing classical finite - state dynamics using continuous language .    quantum - classical models also shed light on the foundations of classical mechanics .",
    "they provide a quantum substrate where interesting classical behavior arises without approximation or decoherence .",
