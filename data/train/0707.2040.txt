    "direct photons , i.e. photons not from hadronic decay , provide a powerful probe for the initial state of matter created in heavy ion collisions , since they interact with the medium only electromagnetically and therefore provide a baseline for the interpretation of jet - quenching models .",
    "the primary motivation for studying the direct photons has been to extract information about the gluon density inside proton in conjunction with dis data .",
    "however , this task has yet to be fulfilled due to difference between the measurement and perturbative qcd calculation which is difficult to explain by altering the gluon density function ( see ref .  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have recently shown that the color dipole formalism coupled to dglap evolution is an viable alternative to the parton model and provided a good description of inclusive photon and dilepton pair production in hadron - hadron collisions @xcite . here",
    "we predict the transverse momentum spectra of direct photons at the lhc energies @xmath0 tev and @xmath1 tev within the same framework .",
    "although in the process of electromagnetic bremsstrahlung by a quark no dipole participates , the cross section can be expressed via the more elementary cross section @xmath2 of interaction of a @xmath3 dipole .",
    "for the dipole cross section , we employ the saturation model of golec - biernat and wsthoff coupled to dglap evolution ( gbw - dglap ) @xcite which is better suited at large transverse momenta . without inclusion of dglap evolution , the direct photon cross section is overestimated @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , we show the gbw - dglap dipole model predictions for inclusive direct photon production at midrapidities for rhic , cdf and lhc energies .",
    "we stress that the theoretical curves in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , are the results of a parameter free calculation . notice also that in contrast to the parton model , neither @xmath4-factor ( nlo corrections ) , nor higher twist corrections are to be added .",
    "no quark - to - photon fragmentation function is needed either .",
    "indeed , the phenomenological dipole cross section is fitted to dis data and incorporates all perturbative and non - perturbative radiation contributions .",
    "for the same reason , in contrast to the parton model , in the dipole approach there is no ambiguity in defining the primordial transverse momentum of partons .",
    "such a small purely non - perturbative primordial momentum does not play a significant role for direct photon production at the given range of @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . notice that the color dipole picture accounts only for pomeron exchange from the target , while ignoring its valence content .",
    "therefore , reggeons are not taken into account , and as a consequence , the dipole is well suited mainly for high - energy processes . as our result for rhic and cdf",
    "energies indicate , we expect that dipole prescription to be at work for the lhc energies . at the tevatron , in order to reject the overwhelming background of secondary photons isolation cuts are imposed @xcite .",
    "isolation conditions are not imposed in our calculation .",
    "however , the cross section does not vary by more than @xmath6 under cdf isolation conditions @xcite .",
    "one should also notice that the parametrizations of the dipole cross section and proton structure function employed in our computation have been fitted to data at considerably lower @xmath5 values @xcite .     at @xmath7 tev @xcite and ( left ) for direct photon at @xmath8 for rhic energy @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "the error bars are the linear sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
