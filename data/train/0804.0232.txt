    "in the standard cosmological model , dark energy and dark matter are the dominant sources in the evolution of the late universe .",

    "various forms of coupling have been considered ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a general coupling may be described in the background by the energy balance equations of cold dark matter ( @xmath1 ) and dark energy ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is conformal time , with @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the rate of energy density transfer , so that @xmath9 implies that the direction of energy transfer is dark matter  @xmath10 dark energy ( dark energy  @xmath10 dark matter ) .",
    "the density evolution in the dark sector deviates from the standard case .",
    "we can use effective equation of state parameters for the dark sector to describe the equivalent uncoupled model in the background : writing @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we have [ weff ] = aq 3_c , = w_x -aq 3_x . when @xmath13 , we have @xmath14 , so that dark matter redshifts faster than @xmath15 , while @xmath16 , so that dark energy has more accelerating power .",
    "the opposite holds for @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath13 , the coupled dark energy can behave like an uncoupled  phantom \" model , i.e. , with @xmath18 , but without the usual problems associated with phantom dark energy  @xcite .    in order to avoid stringent  fifth - force \" constraints",
    ", we assume that baryons ( @xmath19 ) and photons ( @xmath20 ) are not coupled to dark energy and are separately conserved , and we assume the same for neutrinos ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "so the balance equation for fluid @xmath22 is @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the friedman equation is [ fe ] ^2=8g3a^2(_+_+_b+_c+_x ) .",
    "once a form for @xmath8 is given , the background dynamics are fully determined by the above equations , and typically the analysis focuses on the possibility of accelerating attractor solutions ( for recent work with further references , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the models may also be tested against geometric observational constraints ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the perturbed universe , there are subtleties and complications that do not arise for the background dynamics .",

    "for example , if one uses the ansatz @xmath26 , then the background dynamics can be determined and the parameters @xmath27 can be constrained by geometric observations . however , there is no covariant form for such ad hoc ansatzes , and therefore one is unable to compute the perturbations  no consistent cosmological model can be constructed on the basis of such ansatzes . *",

    "here we consider a dark energy fluid , with @xmath32const , that is coupled to dark matter via a covariant energy - momentum transfer four - vector @xmath33 , which reduces in the background to @xmath34 , where @xmath8 is a simple function of energy density .",
    "we show that the gauge - invariant curvature perturbation has a super - hubble instability in the early radiation era , no matter how small the coupling is , and even if adiabatic initial conditions are used .",
    "this rules out these models .",
    "it appears that constant-@xmath35 fluid models of dark energy , even with the imposition of @xmath30 , are unstable to couplings with the dark matter .",

    "in other words , the simple constant-@xmath35 fluid model can not be extended to the early radiation era .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of uncoupled dark energy , where constant-@xmath35 fluid models are well behaved in the primordial universe .",
    "a dynamically evolving quintessence field will likely avoid the instability we find , since @xmath35 typically does not remain constant back to the early radiation era .",
