    "understanding the origin of the sun s magnetic field is the most important topic in solar physics today .",
    "sunspots are a manifestation of strong magnetic field at the surface .",
    "other magnetic features in the form of magnetic flux tubes can be distinguish , like a plages which are a concentration of small - scale magnetic flux tubes ( bright area in solar surface ) and pores which are an isolated vertical magnetic flux tubes . constraining the subsurface structure ,",
    "dynamics and evolution of these magnetic features is essential to establish a relationships between internal solar properties and magnetic activity in the photosphere .",
    "helioseismology is a powerful tool to probe the structure and dynamics of the sun through the observation of solar oscillations .",
    "however , the method of local helioseismology is still limited since the magnetic field is not included in the theory .",
    "we only interpet the observations in the quite sun in term of temperature variation or velocity flow , but not in sunspots where there is a strong magnetic field . therefore",
    ", numerical simulations are needed to infer the structure of the magnetic field by modeling the interaction of waves with magnetic features .    in the first part of this study ( section [ part1 ] )",
    ", we investigate the propagation of a linear surface gravity wave packet ( @xmath0-mode ) through a monolithic structure of magnetic flux tube of different size . in the second part ( section [ part2 ] )",
    ", we explore the helioseismic response of a cluster model which considere the subsurface magnetic field of sunspots and plages as a bundle of small - scale magnetic flux tubes like spaghetti configuration .",
    "we use the code ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cameron et al . 2007 ) ) to propagate a linear and gaussian @xmath0-mode wave packet ( @xmath1 mhz ) through a three dimensional enhanced polytropic atmosphere ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cally & bogdan 1997 ) ) .    in this section ,",
    "we explore the helioseismic response of magnetic flux tubes with radii from 200 km ( e.g. , internetwork magnetic field ) to 3 mm ( e.g. , pore or small sunspot ) .",
    "we considere 4820 g purely vertical flux tube along @xmath2-direction .",
    "the flux tube is almost evacuated and it is superposed on the background atmosphere .",
    "the scattered wave field is constructed as the difference between the simulation with and without the flux tube .",
    "different scattered wave field patterns were observed for the different flux tubes . when the flux tube is small compared to the value of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the wavelength of the incident wave , mainly the @xmath5 kink modes are excited ( @xmath6 is the azimutal number of the wave ) . for mid - ranged tubes ,",
    "the oscillations are a mixture of @xmath5 kink mode , and @xmath7 sausage modes . for larger tubes , numerous modes with various @xmath6",
    "are excited ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* daiffallah et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "if we plot the maximum scattering amplitude versus tube radius measured in the far field ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , we find that tubes with radii around @xmath3 are the largest scatterers .",
    "we explain the decrease of scattering after this value of radius by the excitation of @xmath6-modes and the absorption of waves by these large tubes .",
    "for example in the case of tube with @xmath8 mm , a part of @xmath0-mode is converted to slow magneto - acoustic - gravity mode which propagates along magnetic field lines in @xmath2-direction ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * cally 2005 ) ) .",
    "this process can explain the observations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* braun et al.(1987 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* braun et al.(1988 ) ) which reveal a deficient in the power of the outgoing wave compared to the incoming wave from a typical sunspot on the solar surface ( fourier - hankel analysis ) .    .",
    "the dashed and the solid lines show the oscillations of a single tube of 200 km radius and the monolithic equivalent tube , respectively .",
    "the separation between the tubes inside the loose cluster is about @xmath3 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=249 ] .",
    "the dashed and the solid lines show the oscillations of a single tube of 200 km radius and the monolithic equivalent tube , respectively .",
    "the separation between the tubes inside the loose cluster is about @xmath3 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]",
    "in this section , we want to know what is the structure of magnetic field beneath sunspots : is it like a monolithic model as in section [ part1 ] or like a cluster model ? how to distinguish from the observed oscillations between these two models ?",
    "the cluster model can be a good approximation to simulate solar plage regions which are composed of an ensemble of compactly packed thin flux tubes ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hanasoge & cally 2009 ) ) .",
    "motiveted by these problems , we investigate the propagation of waves ( @xmath0-mode ) through a cluster of small identical magnetic flux tubes of 200 km radius ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hindman & jain 2012 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* daiffallah 2013 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* felipe et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "we have studied two cases , one is a compact cluster which it consists of seven identical magnetic flux tubes in a hexagonal close - packed configuration , and the other case is a loose cluster of nine tubes .",
    "the fig.[fig2 ] shows the horizontal displacement of the central tube axis as a function of depth @xmath2 ( dot - dashed line ) for the compact cluster in left panel , and the loose cluster in right panel .",
    "we can observe that the upper part of the compact cluster oscillates more like a single tube of 200 km radius ( dashed line ) than like the monolithic equivalent tube of 600 km ( solid line ) .",
    "furthermore , the large amplitude of the compact cluster compared to the amplitude of 200 km single tube confirm that this oscillation concerne the whole part of the compact cluster and not the tubes individually .",
    "this can be seen in the scattered wave field of the compact cluster in the fig.[fig3 ] where the compact cluster seems oscillate like a single object and there is no observation of multiple scattering in the near field .    the amplitude of the loose cluster in the right panel of fig.[fig2 ] is smaller than the amplitude of the 200 km single tube , which means that the incident wave energy is converted to tubes oscillation and the oscillation of the loose cluster in fig.[fig2 ] corresponds to that of the individual tubes .",
    "therefore , the loose cluster will show multiple scattering from the individual tubes in the near field . in this case",
    ", the absorption of the incident wave by the cluster will be enhanced .",
    "sunspots are a manifestations of strong magnetic field at the solar surface .",
    "they represent a major relation between internal magnetic field and solar activity in the photosphere .",
    "local helioseismology is a powerful tool to investigate the substructure of the sun .",
    "however , interpretation of data have been somewhat ambiguous in solar active regions where the magnetic field is strong .",
    "numerical simulations provide an efficient and direct way to understand the helioseismic signature of solar magnetic features , which have recently begun to be observed .",
    "we simulate in this study the propagation of a linear @xmath0-mode wave packet through different magnetic features .",
    "the aim is to get informations about the characteristics and the structure of these features by studying the scattered waves observed at the solar surface .",
    "the principal results of the simulations can be summarized in the following way :    * magnetic flux tubes are a strong absorbers and scatterers of @xmath0-mode waves .",
    "* different scattered wave field patterns were observed for different monolithic magnetic flux tubes radii .",
    "this will allow us to inferring the typical size of magnetic structures , but also magnetic field strength , vector orientation , profile , ... * a cluster model of magnetic flux tubes ( compact or loose ) scatters waves in different way from a monolithic model .",
    "this will allow us to inferring the magnetic structure of more complex solar features ( sunspots , plages , ... ) and distinguish between monolithic or cluster model , compact or loose cluster . * determining the parameters of these magnetic features , that is , structure , typical size , field strength , ... will help to reveal details of the process of solar dynamo and how magnetic field is transported up through the convection zone . *",
    "the subsurface structure of sunspots is still poorly understood , we need ( i ) high - resolution space observations , ( ii ) improving simulations ."
