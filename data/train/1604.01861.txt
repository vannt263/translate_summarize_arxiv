    "development of a detailed understanding of charmonium production and decay in heavy - ion collisions is an important but difficult task .",
    "the charmonium production rate is correlated with the nature of the medium produced in the heavy - ion collision , which might be a quark gluon plasma ; and many of the charmonium decays involve production of mesons with exposed charm , which themselves interact both with lighter mesons and the medium on their way to producing the observed final states .",
    "detailed knowledge of such hadronic effects and interactions is therefore required in order to reach reliable conclusions about a new state of matter from the final composition and distribution of decay products .",
    "information about charm - meson final - state interactions can be inferred from charmonium decays .",
    "an important example is the `` exotic '' heavy charmed state @xmath6 , first observed in @xmath7 decays by belle @xcite , confirmed by babar @xcite , and found in @xmath8 collisions by the cdf  ii @xcite and d@xmath9 @xcite collaborations .",
    "the @xmath6 appears to be a @xmath10 state and , within errors , its mass @xcite , @xmath11mev@xmath12 , coincides with the @xmath13 threshold .",
    "its composition is controversial and numerous theoretical descriptions have been proposed , _",
    "e.g_.  a mixture of pure charmonium and a molecular bound state @xcite , a purely molecular bound state @xcite , and a tetraquark state @xcite .",
    "molecular bound states are plausible since the mass difference between the @xmath6 and the @xmath13 system is extremely small , as discussed in ref.@xcite ; and although the binding mechanisms differ , these states might bear similarities to conjectured @xmath8 bound states in @xmath14 decays @xcite .",
    "irrespective of its internal structure , the observed decays @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xcite , and @xmath18 @xcite involve final - state interactions , which can be studied using phenomenological lagrangians .",
    "in such an approach , the @xmath19 state in @xmath20 is preceded by a @xmath1-meson loop that couples to the @xmath14 and @xmath0 @xcite and the reaction @xmath21 involves an intermediate triangle diagram with pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xcite .",
    "the model lagrangians are expressed in terms of couplings , _",
    "e.g_.  @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry implies that all such lagrangian couplings are degenerate at leading order @xcite ; but significant @xmath26 corrections spoil this prediction . in the limit of exact chiral , heavy - flavor and spin symmetries ,",
    "a heavy - meson chiral effective lagrangian @xcite describes the strong interactions between any two heavy mesons and a pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone boson , where the effective coupling , @xmath27 , plays a basic role . at leading order in the effective theory ,",
    "this coupling can be related to the hadronic @xmath28 decay amplitude : @xmath29 where , with @xmath30 the @xmath2-meson polarisation vector , @xmath31 it has been shown , however , that @xmath32 corrections are not negligible : applying eq . to both the strong decay @xmath33 and the ( unphysical ) process @xmath34 in the chiral limit @xcite",
    ", there is a material difference between the values of @xmath27 extracted from either @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "another issue also arises : can @xmath27 be realistically and unambiguously related to all the strong - interaction matrix elements mentioned above , @xmath37 , @xmath23 , etc . , _",
    "i.e_.  is there a practically useful universal value of @xmath27 ?",
    "the study of interactions between charmed mesons and nuclear matter are a major piece of the proposed activities of the @xmath38anda collaboration at the future facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) @xcite ; and it could also conceivably be pursued at the upgraded jefferson laboratory .",
    "for example , low - momentum charmonia , such as @xmath14 and @xmath39 , as well as @xmath40 mesons , can be produced by annihilation of antiprotons on nuclei @xcite and in electroproduction from nuclei owing to enhancements of hadronic interactions at threshold @xcite .",
    "since charmonia do not share valence - quarks in common with the surrounding nuclear medium , competing mechanisms have been proposed to describe the influence of that medium on their propagation , _",
    "e.g_.  qcd van der waals forces , arising from the exchange of two or more gluons between color - singlet states @xcite ; and intermediate charmed hadron states @xcite , such that @xmath41 hadronic vacuum polarization components of the @xmath14 interact with the medium via meson exchanges @xcite .",
    "model lagrangians have also been employed to study interactions between open - charm mesons and nuclei in attempts to explore the possibility of charmed nuclear bound states @xcite .",
    "they are formulated with couplings between @xmath5 mesons and light pseudoscalar and vector mesons , which are typically derived via an @xmath42 extension of light - flavor chirally - symmetric lagrangians .",
    "exotic states formed from a heavy meson and a nucleon were also investigated using heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "one might also seek a direct computation of the in - medium properties of systems containing charm by using a bound - state formalism .",
    "for example , the variation of the pion s mass , decay constant and elastic form factor as a function of nuclear density was recently studied in a light - front approach in ref.@xcite . in the longer term , however , one hopes to achieve a symmetry - preserving description of the in - medium properties of charm bound - states via a direct study of the relevant gap and bethe - salpeter equations subject to the inclusion of a chemical potential , as completed for the @xmath43- and @xmath0-mesons with simplified interaction kernels @xcite .    in the context of this widespread interest in systems containing charm ,",
    "herein we determine the general structure of the coupling of a @xmath0-meson , which is typically off - shell , to on - shell @xmath1- and @xmath2-mesons and compute the poincar - invariant amplitudes that arise , using a framework in which all elements are constrained by dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) studies in qcd .",
    "this approach provides a simultaneous description of light- and heavy - quarks and the bound states they constitute as well as of their electromagnetic and heavy - to - light transition form factors and strong couplings in the so - called triangle digram approximation  @xcite .",
    "the simplest case , _ viz_.  the @xmath44 coupling , @xmath23 , has previously been considered , with an estimate of the @xmath42 flavor - breaking pattern which relates @xmath23 to the well - constrained benchmark @xmath45 coupling and to the @xmath46 coupling , namely the ratios of couplings @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the case of exact @xmath42 symmetry , these ratios are respectively , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , though it was found that @xmath42 flavor symmetry is broken at the 300 - 400% level  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in comparison with common monopole parametrizations @xcite , the @xmath44 form factors computed in ref.@xcite possess a larger zero - momentum coupling and are considerably softer .",
    "these qualities could have a significant impact , _",
    "e.g_.  on predictions for @xmath6 production in heavy - ion collisions , which have sometimes used momentum - independent couplings based on @xmath42 symmetry @xcite .",
    "herein , therefore , we revisit and extend the study in ref.@xcite , and compute the couplings @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we analyse the complete structure of the amplitudes and expose differences in the magnitude and functional forms of the five associated momentum - dependent couplings .",
    "the couplings used in phenomenological lagrangians can be related to amplitudes describing transitions between on - shell pseudoscalar and/or vector @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) mesons via emission of a @xmath0-meson , which is typically off - shell in practice .",
    "the transition amplitudes may be expressed in terms of incoming and outgoing momenta , @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively , with @xmath58 being the @xmath0-meson momentum , and the helicity , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , of the participating vector - mesons .",

    "the dse approach to the calculation of hadron observables is poincar covariant provided the full structure of hadron bound - state amplitudes is retained @xcite .",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to a simple one - covariant model for the amplitudes , with the goal of simultaneously describing a wide range of phenomena ; and with omission of the full structure of amplitudes comes the complication that our results can be sensitive to the definition of the relativistic relative momentum .",

    "indeed , couplings between @xmath1- , @xmath2-mesons and @xmath43- , @xmath0-mesons can differ by almost an order - of - magnitude , and they also exhibit different evolution with light - meson virtuality [ table  [ tab1 ] and fig.[fig1 ] ] .",
    "it seems worthwhile to explore the impact of our findings on a wide variety of predictions for charmed meson observables , such as those described in the introduction that are based on phenomenological meson - exchange models .",
