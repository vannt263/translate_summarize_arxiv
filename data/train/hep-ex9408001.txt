    "40004000  = 1000      the nucleon spin - dependent structure functions , @xmath13 and @xmath3 , can be determined in deep inelastic scattering of polarized charged leptons on polarized nucleons .",
    "both are important for the understanding of nucleon spin structure .",
    "the structure function @xmath13 is used to test qcd sum rules , and in the quark  parton model",
    "it determines the contribution of the quark spins to the nucleon spin .",
    "the spin structure function @xmath3 differs from zero because of the masses and the transverse momenta of the quarks .",
    "it has a unique leading - order sensitivity to twist-3 operators , i.e. , quark ",
    "gluon correlation effects in qcd .",
    "the measurement of @xmath3 would provide the first information on these twist-3 operator matrix elements  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "@xmath3 can be written as the sum of a contribution , @xmath14 , directly calculable from @xmath13  @xcite , and a pure twist-3 term @xmath15  @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the four - momentum transfer squared , and @xmath19 is the bjorken scaling variable.in several recent papers , values for @xmath15 and their approximate @xmath20 dependence have been calculated using different assumptions @xcite .",
    "a sum rule for @xmath3 , @xmath21 was derived by burkhardt and cottingham using regge theory  @xcite .",
    "it has been regarded as a consequence of conservation of angular momentum  @xcite . at present",
    "the validity of the derivation of this sum rule is in question  @xcite , and it is clearly important to test it experimentally .    two kinds of spin - dependent cross - section asymmetries can be measured in inclusive lepton ",
    "nucleon scattering .",
    "when the target polarization is parallel to the direction of the longitudinally - polarized beam , the asymmetry is given by @xmath22 , whilst for a target polarized in a direction transverse to the beam , the asymmetry is given by @xmath23 @xmath24 here , @xmath25 corresponds to @xmath26 for parallel  ( antiparallel ) beam and target polarization . for perpendicular target polarisation",
    ", @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) stands for @xmath29 , when the target spin points in the upwards ( downwards ) direction .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath30 is defined about the beam axis , @xmath31 corresponding to a muon scattered upwards",
    ". it can be shown that @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath32 , and thus it is convenient to define @xmath33 , which is independent of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the virtual photon absorption asymmetries @xmath34 are related to the measured asymmetries @xmath22 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the virtual photon  nucleon absorption cross sections for total helicity 1/2 and 3/2 , respectively , and",
    "@xmath39 arises from the helicity spin - flip amplitude in forward photon ",
    "nucleon compton scattering  @xcite .",
    "the kinematic factor @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the energy transfer in the laboratory frame , and  @xmath43 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath44 is related to the virtual photon depolarization factor @xmath45 by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse photoabsorption cross sections , @xmath48/@xmath49 . in the case of @xmath22 ,",
    "the contribution of the @xmath2 term relative to @xmath50 is suppressed by a factor  @xmath40 .",
    "the opposite is true for the case of @xmath35 .",
    "positivity conditions  @xcite limit the magnitudes of @xmath50 and @xmath2 @xmath51 the asymmetries @xmath50 and @xmath2 can be expressed in terms of the structure functions @xmath13 and @xmath3 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the spin - independent structure function .",
    "the ratio @xmath47 , determined at slac  @xcite , is about 0.3 in the range @xmath54 for @xmath55  gev@xmath56 , and similar values are usually assumed at smaller  @xmath19 . using these values of @xmath47 , the positivity condition on @xmath2  [ eq .  ( [ upper ] ) ] combined with eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) leads to an upper limit for @xmath57 which is approximately of the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 varies from 0.07 to 0.10 .",
    "thus , large values of @xmath3 are allowed in the low @xmath19 region .    in the past",
    ", only @xmath22 has been measured in polarized deep inelastic experiments on the proton .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath50 has been extracted from these measurements by neglecting the contribution of the @xmath2 term . in this paper",
    "we present data on @xmath35 , which makes it possible to extract @xmath50 and @xmath2 with no approximations [ eqs .",
    "( [ ag1 ] ) and  ( [ ag2 ] ) ] .",
    "the @xmath50 results have been published in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this letter , we present the results for the asymmetry @xmath2 , and for the structure function @xmath3 .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the cern sps by scattering 100  gev longitudinally - polarized muons off transversely - polarized protons . the polarized target and the spectrometer used for these measurements",
    "are basically the same as those used to measure longitudinal asymmetries , and have been described in a previous publication  @xcite .",
    "the new smc target incorporates a sufficiently strong dipole field of 0.5 t  @xcite , in which the proton polarization can be maintained transverse to the beam direction .",
    "the two cells of the butanol target , each 60 cm long , were longitudinally polarized along a solenoid field of 2.5 t by dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) . when high polarization was reached , the proton spins were ` frozen ' at a base temperature of about 60mk , and rotated to a transverse ( vertical ) direction by applying the additional dipole field and reducing the longitudinal field to zero .",
    "upwards ( downwards ) transverse polarization was achieved by choosing the initial longitudinal polarization parallel ( antiparallel ) to the beam direction .",
    "the spins were reversed 10 times during the 17 days of data - taking .",
    "the transverse field was always applied in the same direction to avoid different acceptances . as it was not possible to measure the polarization in the transverse spin direction at 0.5  t ,",
    "it was measured before and after each reversal in the solenoid field at 2.5  t. the loss of polarization was less than 1% over a period of 12h .",
    "the average polarization was @xmath60 .",
    "the deflection of the incoming muons caused by the transverse dipole field was 2.25  mrad , and was compensated by an additional magnet , installed 7 m upstream of the target .",
    "the reconstruction software was modified to account for the curvature of the beam tracks in the region between the two sets of scintillator hodoscopes used to determine their direction .",
    "track reconstruction and vertex fitting inside the dipole field were tested by a monte  carlo simulation , and were found to perform just as well as in the case of the solenoid field used for longitudinal asymmetry measurements .",
    "the incident muons mostly come from pion decay and are naturally polarized in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the average beam polarization at 100 gev was determined from the positron energy spectrum in the decay @xmath61 , and found to be @xmath62  =  @xmath63 @xcite , in good agreement with the monte carlo simulation of the beam transport  @xcite .",
    "the events were required to satisfy @xmath64 ,  @xmath65  gev , and @xmath66  gev , in order to avoid large radiative corrections , to eliminate muons originating from the decay of pions produced in the target , and events with poor kinematic resolution .",
    "a total of @xmath67 events was obtained in the range @xmath0 and @xmath68  gev@xmath56 .",
    "the event distribution as a function of the angle @xmath30 is shown in fig .",
    "most events are collected in the regions where the angle @xmath30 is close to zero or @xmath69 because the trigger conditions predominantly select muons scattered in a direction close to the vertical plane .",
    "this optimizes our measurement , because only muons scattered in a plane close to the polarization plane contribute effectively to the asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetries were obtained separately for each target cell .",
    "the raw asymmetry @xmath70 is measured in bins of @xmath71 , and @xmath30 from the number of scattered muons ( @xmath72 ) in the azimuthal directions ( @xmath30,@xmath73 ) , and the corresponding counts ( @xmath74 ) evaluated after a reversal of the polarization . assuming that the ratio of the spectrometer acceptances at angles @xmath30 and @xmath73 is the same during the periods before and after polarization reversal , we obtain      the transverse asymmetry is then @xmath76 where @xmath62 and @xmath77 are the beam and target polarizations , and @xmath78 is the fraction of polarizable protons in the target material  @xmath79 . the values of @xmath35 corresponding to the same @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are averaged over the @xmath30 intervals , and over the five subsamples defined by the ten polarization reversals .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath2 is extracted from @xmath35 and @xmath22 in ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) bins , using eqs .",
    "( [ ag1 ] ) and ( [ ag2 ] ) . for @xmath22",
    "we use previous measurements on longitudinally polarized targets  @xcite .",
    "these experiments have published @xmath50 , extracted through the relation @xmath80 , where the @xmath2 contribution is neglected .",
    "we parametrize the @xmath50 data and recover @xmath22 through the same relation .    since no @xmath20 dependence is observed within the errors , we present the average of @xmath2 in each bin of @xmath19 ( see table  [ a2numbs ] ) . if the @xmath15 contribution can be neglected in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) and @xmath50 is independent of @xmath20 , @xmath81 is expected to scale . however ,",
    "if we average @xmath81 , instead of @xmath2 , we obtain the same results .",
    "the dominant systematic error on @xmath35 is the variation of the ratio of acceptances in the upper and lower parts of the spectrometer between polarization reversals .",
    "the resulting false asymmetries have been studied using real data and a monte  carlo simulation , and found to be negligible compared to the statistical error .",
    "radial effects and overall variations in detector efficiencies do not cause false asymmetries because they affect the upper and lower part of the spectrometer in the same way .",
    "the radiative corrections to @xmath82 were calculated with the method of ref .",
    "@xcite and found to be smaller than 0.001 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath2 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and table  [ a2numbs ] .",
    "the limit imposed by the positivity condition ( eq .  [ upper ] ) is also shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the present measurements constrain the asymmetry function @xmath2 to values much smaller than the positivity limit . at 90  % confidence level , we obtain @xmath83 for @xmath4 , and @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "these improved limits have been used in ref .",

    "they have been calculated from the values of @xmath13 from refs .",
    "@xcite assuming that @xmath13 scales with @xmath86 .",
    "additional sources of systematic errors in @xmath2 are the parametrization of longitudinal asymmetries , and the uncertainty in @xmath47 .",
    "both effects are smaller than 10  % of the statistical error .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath3 are listed in table  [ a2numbs ] , together with those of @xmath87 ( eq .  [ g2ww ] ) evaluated at the same @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the two sets are compatible within the statistical errors .",
    "therefore the present data do not show evidence for @xmath15 to be different from zero .",
    "the limited accuracy of the present data does not allow sensitive tests of specific predictions , such as the partial cancellation between the two terms of @xmath3 predicted by the bag models of refs .",
    "large contributions of @xmath15 close to the positivity limit are excluded in the @xmath19  range covered .",
    "however , @xmath15 about one order of magnitude larger than @xmath87 would still be allowed within the statistical errors .    when the minimum @xmath20 requirement is reduced to 0.5  gev@xmath56 , the data with @xmath88  gev@xmath56 in the lowest @xmath19-bin yield @xmath89 , which is consistent with the value for @xmath90  gev@xmath56 .",
    "if we neglect the @xmath20 dependence within the kinematic range of the present data , the results of table  [ a2numbs ] can be used to calculate the limits for the integral of @xmath3 , @xmath91 at 90 % confidence level .",
    "we do not attempt the evaluation of the first moment of @xmath3 , in order to test the burkhardt ",
