    "recent progress in microfabrication and measurement techniques makes it possible to study the properties of mesoscopic superconducting samples , and , in particular , disks with sizes comparable to the penetration depth @xmath0 and the coherence length @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "depending on the disk size various superconducting states can exist in such samples in an external magnetic field .    in small disks ,",
    "where the confinement dominates , there exist only giant vortex ( @xmath2 ) states ( circular symmetric states with a fixed value of angular momentum @xmath3 )  @xcite . for sufficiently large disks the @xmath4 state can break up into the multi - vortex ( @xmath5 ) state ( a mixture of giant vortices with different angular momentum )  @xcite .",
    "also ring - shaped vortex states with larger energy than @xmath2 and @xmath5 ones were predicted  @xcite .",
    "these ring - shaped two - dimensional vortex states have a cylindrically symmetric magnetic field profile and they are different from the ring - vortices that were e.g. found in three - dimensional superfluid liquid helium .",
    "but the analysis of ref .  @xcite showed that in a superconducting disk in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field the ring - shaped vortices are unstable .    in the present paper",
    "we study the @xmath5 states of a thin superconducting disk in an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath6 with step - like profile .",
    "this magnetic field profile could approximate the field resulting from a magnetic dot ( they are usually used in experiments , e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as the field of a current loop ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we found that this model field profile captures a lot of interesting physics and that the step height and width strongly influence the superconducting phase diagram .",
    "the details of our approach can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and , therefore , we briefly sketch only the necessary steps .",
    "we restrict ourselves to sufficiently thin disks such that @xmath7 . in this case , to a first approximation , the magnetic field due to the circulating superconducting currents may be neglected and the magnetic field inside the disk equals the external one .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , the order parameter of the @xmath5 state is written as a linear combination of eigenfunctions of the _ linearized _ ginzburg - landau equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radial distance from the disk center , @xmath10 is the azimuthal angle , and @xmath11 enumerates the different radial states for the same @xmath12 . in the homogeneous magnetic field case @xmath3 is the value of the effective total angular momentum which is equal to the number of vortices in the disk .",
    "later we will see that , for our inhomogeneous magnetic field case , the assignment of the total vorticity can be tricky .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) in the free energy ( measured in @xmath13 units ) @xmath14 \\right\\ } \\text { , }   \\label{free_en}\\ ] ] ( here @xmath15 is the local magnetic field , @xmath16 is the vector potential ) we obtain @xmath17 as a function of the complex parameters @xmath18 .",
    "minimization of @xmath17 with respect to these parameters allows to find the equilibrium vortex configurations and to determine their stability .",
    "we restrict ourselves to states built up by only two components in eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) .",
    "it brings quantitative bounds in our analysis but , nevertheless , gives the correct qualitative behavior and facilitates the physical insight into the problem . using two different approaches from refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath5 configurations with three and five components in eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) were checked .",
    "this resulted in 1 )  a reduction of the region of existence of metastable @xmath5 states at the low magnetic field limit , 2 )  an appearance of additional unstable states corresponding to the saddle points of the free energy function , and 3 )  no new vortex configurations in the ground state .",
    "thus , two components in eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) are sufficient to describe the vortex structure in the ground state of our system .",
    "depending on the radial state of the components we defined two different configurations : _ giant - giant _ ( @xmath19 ) and _ giant - ring _ ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) @xmath5 states .",
    "the first represents a combination of two @xmath22 states while the second is composed of one giant and one ring vortex .",
    "first , we investigate the case of a centered step - like magnetic field corresponding to a magnetic disk . the effect of the size of the superconducting disk on the vortex state is shown in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "the parameters considered are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the solid lines indicate where the ground state of the free energy changes from one state to another and dashed lines correspond to transitions between different @xmath2 states as metastable states .",
    "the right axis of the diagram shows the corresponding positive flux through the region @xmath25 .",
    "one can clearly see the _ re - entrant _ behavior .",
    "for example , for @xmath26 we observe the following change of total vorticity @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the ground state with total vorticity @xmath28 and @xmath29 covers the largest part of the phase diagram . with increasing disk size ,",
    "all other @xmath2 states are strongly suppressed in favor of the various @xmath5 states . for small disk sizes different @xmath2 states are present as the ground state . but with increase of disk size , islands with different @xmath5 configurations ( _ giant - ring _ and _ giant - giant _ @xmath5 states ) dominate the ground state diagram . for @xmath30 ,",
    "a giant - ring @xmath5 state appears , and for @xmath31 we obtain giant - giant states .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , for example , for @xmath32 and with increasing magnetic field @xmath33 , giant - giant combinations @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 etc .",
    "become the ground state . in the contour plot of the @xmath37-distribution for these states we observe single vortices which are arranged on a ring with a low density area ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , blue color - zero density , red - highest density ) situated in the center of the disk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , for the @xmath38 state ) .",
    "this central area is associated with a giant vortex , and encircling it leads to a phase change showing the vorticity @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig3](b ) shows the contour plot of the corresponding phase with seven anti - vortices arranged in a circle around the giant vortex and the _ total _ vorticity is @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that for the disk size @xmath40 and with changing of @xmath41 _ giant - giant _ @xmath5 states consist only of vortices arranged radially symmetric with no anti - vortices present .",
    "thus , it is obvious that enlarging the superconducting disk enhances the influence of the negative part of the step - like magnetic field . as a result",
    "we obtain a new giant - giant form called _ giant  multi anti - vortex _ states .",
    "the total vorticity is now equal to the lowest vorticity of the giant vortex states of which the multi - vortex consists of .",
    "this inevitably leads to a re - entrant behavior in the total vorticity , which is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite where it was found numerically that several vortices can enter ( or exit ) at once for disks with sufficiently large radius . for @xmath40 disks we only found that @xmath42 transitions are possible . with increase of the disk radius the @xmath35 and @xmath36 _ giant - multi anti - vortex",
    "_ states become @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the multi - vortex states become metastable again and the @xmath28 and @xmath29 states are now the only ground states . moreover , for @xmath46 we have the meissner state for all values of the applied magnetic field .",
    "next , we move the step - like field profile along the radius of the superconducting disk , i.e. consider a ring magnetic field profile as in the case of a current loop . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we present the phase diagram as function of @xmath47 . the parameters of the magnetic field profile are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath32 .",
    "thick solid curves indicate the transitions between different vortex states and dashed lines denote transitions between metastable @xmath2 states .",
    "the _ re - entrant _ behavior , as in previous case , is clearly visible .",
    "the most important result is that the @xmath5 states dominate this diagram .",
    "moreover , we have both types of multi - vortices , i.e. _ giant - giant _ and _ giant - ring _ , as ground state , and with shifting the field profile towards the disk periphery , giant - giant @xmath5 configurations cover most of the superconducting region .",
    "the giant - giant @xmath5 states in this case appear both as states with no anti - vortices present , and as _ giant  multi anti - vortex _ states . following the transition lines ,",
    "a correspondence between different giant - multi anti - vortex states @xmath50 can be seen : @xmath51 remains the same , while @xmath52 increases from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "as one can see , the latter is strongly correlated with _",
    "re - entrant _ behavior . in the rest of the diagram ,",
    "the @xmath5 states with the  classical  geometry ( both _ giant - giant _ and _ giant - ring _ ) dominate . however , a difference between those states exists . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , in the case of a _ giant - ring _ state , vortices are preferentially distributed within a ring - shaped lower density area .",
    "further , considering the high density areas at the disk periphery , a shift in phase of @xmath55 is observed , where @xmath3 is the total vorticity .",
    "although these states have a different origin sometimes they can exhibit a similar distribution of vortices but the phase is always able to distinguish between them .",
