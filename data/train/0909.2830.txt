    "the high - altitude water cherenkov ( hawc ) experiment will be built at 4100 meters on a plateau below the highest mountain in mexico , the pico de orizaba .",
    "it will be 10 to 15 times more sensitive than its predecessor , the milagro observatory@xcite . like milagro , hawc will survey the sky ( from its location at 19@xmath1 north latitude ) continuously measuring extensive air showers generated by cosmic and gamma rays , leading to a large field - of - view of @xmath02  sr .",
    "the physics goal of hawc is to make major progress in studying the origin of of cosmic rays .",
    "this can be achieved by detecting the highest energy gamma - ray sources ( @xmath0100 tev ) and by measuring and mapping the galactic diffuse gamma - ray emission from 1 tev to 100 tev .",
    "because of its @xmath2% duty cycle , hawc is particularly well suited to search for transients , new galactic and extragalactic sources of vhe gamma - radiation , and for small- and large - scale anisotropies in the cosmic radiation in an unbiased sky survey . in order to meet these physics goals ,",
    "good angular resolution is essential .",
    "with hawc we aim for an angular resolution between 0.25@xmath3 and 0.55@xmath3 , where 0.55@xmath3 is representative of low energies and 0.25@xmath3 of high energies . as in milagro",
    "the shower direction will be reconstructed using the relative times at which each of the pmts is hit . in this paper",
    ", we will describe the design of the optical calibration system that will be used to monitor the relative time responses of each pmt in the hawc detector .",
    "the hawc observatory is described in more detail elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "it will re - use the 900 8 `` pmts@xcite from milagro .",
    "the pmts will be deployed at a depth of @xmath04 m of water in separate tanks .",
    "the tanks will be closely packed in an array covering an area of approximately 150 m x 150 m . depending on the detailed design , more than 60% of this area will be covered with water .",
    "two alternative designs are under consideration : one with 900 individual rotomolded water tanks of @xmath4 m diameter holding one pmt ; a second with 7.3 m diameter tanks ( which are a combination of corrugated galvanized steel walls and a water - tight bladder ) holding three pmts",
    ". each tank will have one or more 8 '' baffled , upward - facing pmt(s ) anchored to the bottom .",
    "figure  [ fig - array ] shows a sketch of the proposed 900 tank deployment pattern .",
    "the primary goal of the optical calibration system is to monitor the time stability of the pmts and related readout / digitization electronics . to achieve an angular resolution of @xmath50.55@xmath3",
    "it is not only necessary to know the position of each pmt to only a few cm , but also to know the relative times at which each pmt in the array has been hit to an uncertainty of @xmath6ns .",
    "furthermore the channel to channel timing drifts and the slewing must be monitored and corrected for accordingly@xcite .",
    "the components of the hawc optical calibration system are chosen to meet this goal .",
    "this includes _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath7ns pulse - width laser light source@xcite and the use of equal length , duplex optical fibers on all fiber paths . furthermore to monitor the time slewing and to measure the _ photo - electron calibration _ of each ( pmt ) channel@xcite , filter wheels at the laser light source will allow control of the light pulses over a dynamic range from @xmath8 pe to @xmath9 pes .    for reasons of practicality and redundancy ,",
    "the tank pmts are divided into two groups : denoted _ black _ and _ white _ for optical calibration .",
    "this is sketched in figure  [ fig - array ] where @xmath10 physically nearby pmts form a black ( or white ) _ square_. the pattern of _ squares _ is similar to the pattern on a checker(chess ) board . a possible pattern of _ squares _",
    "is shown ( for the lower - right quadrant of the array ) in figure  [ fig - array ] .",
    "the calibration design foresees two separate laser light delivery systems .",
    "one laser plus optical distribution system will be used to pulse all of the black tanks , a second system will pulse all of the white tanks .",
    "the two laser systems and associating monitoring instrumentation will be located in a temperature controlled enclosure at the center of the hawc array ( shown as black rectangle in the center of the array in figure  [ fig - array ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - lightsource ] shows a sketch of one of the proposed light sources and its associating instrumentation .",
    "the light from the teem photonics powerchip laser@xcite will be sent through a beam expander@xcite into a 1:37 optical splitter@xcite at the calibration light source .",
    "the 1:37 optical splitter will fan - out the laser light pulses into the @xmath11 30 paths leading to the centers of all black ( or white ) _ squares _ of tanks . to connect to the approximate center of each _",
    "square _ we will use same - length , @xmath0200 m long , @xmath12m/125",
    "@xmath13 m graded index duplex fibers . finally at each _ square _",
    "the light is split again to be routed on @xmath025 m fibers to each tank ( see figure  [ fig - field ] ) where the fibers will be terminated with a simple diffuser positioned at a fixed distance from each tank pmt .",
    "additionally there will be one loop - back duplex fiber for monitoring ( double ) the optical fiber light transmission time for a representative light path for each _ square _ , and @xmath14 fiber to a tank in the adjacent _ square _ to link the timing of black and white optical calibrations .    .",
    "see text for details.,width=288 ]    .,width=288 ]    the @xmath0200 m long , duplex fibers naturally provide an outgoing and a return light path .",
    "the outgoing light path is needed to deliver the laser light pulses to the center of each _ square_.",
    "the return light path is used to monitor the light pulses by returning one representative signal ; see figure  [ fig - field ] . in summary",
    "the outgoing light follows the path from : the laser , into the 1:37 splitter , coupled through a patch panel ( at the light source see figure  [ fig - lightsource ] ) , into the @xmath0200 m long fiber to the _ field distribution _ at the center of each _ square _ where the light is split again to be routed on @xmath025 m fibers to each tank",
    ". the return light path will be exactly double the total optical fiber light path and is used to return a representative light signal from each _ square _ ; see figure  [ fig - field ] . again for both redundancy and practicality reasons , the return light pulses are merged using four 19:1 optical fan - ins@xcite , one for each quadrant of the array ; see figure  [ fig - lightsource ] .",
    "the return light will then be monitored with a small photo - tube@xcite . up to small timing differences",
    ", all return signals will arrive at the same time . thus to distinguish each light path",
    ", we are considering adding optical delay fibers , in increments of @xmath15 m of fiber delay , between the return light fibers from the _ squares _ and the 1:19 optical fan - ins . in this way",
    "each light path can be easily monitored .",
    "an example , showing the return light from three separate calibration loop - back signals , is shown in figure  [ fig - scope ] .",
    "the relative time delay from 5 m optical fiber is 25.6ns .    assuming a relative timing delay of @xmath165 m of optical fiber",
    ", the distinct light signals observed in the initial proof of principle study ( figure  [ fig - scope ] ) suggests that it should be straight forward to monitor all light paths to a precision of @xmath14ns using _",
    "e.g. _ a 4-channel digital oscilloscope digitize the return light pulses for each of the optical calibration light paths .",
    "several laboratory tests of the calibration system have already been performed .",
    "these have focused on proof of principle tests : _",
    "e.g. _ how uniform are the light signals in the 37 output fibers of the 1:37 optical splitter at the light source , or the light signals in the 19 optical fibers of the 1:19 optical splitter at the _ field distribution _ at each _",
    "square_. the other critical issue is the expected light at the individual tank pmts and whether it can result in @xmath17 pes ( the maximum signal needed to monitor the pmt / readout time slewing corrections ) .",
    "to achieve uniform fiber - to - fiber illumination with any 1:n splitter requires that the size of the light spot is significantly larger than the size of the fiber bundle .",
    "laser beams can be increased in size easily using commercial beam expanders .",
    "the balance is then between fiber - to - fiber uniformity and the signal size in each fiber : more uniformity comes at the cost of decreased signal size .",
    "first measurements with the jds uniphase power chip laser@xcite find that expanding the beam at the laser by a factor of @xmath18 results in a rather uniform illumination of the 1:37 optical fiber splitter@xcite .",
    "a laserprobe rm6600a radiometer with a rjp-465 silicon sensor@xcite has been used to measure the laser intensity and the signals into the optical fibers . as an example , with a @xmath19 beam expander .",
    "typical fiber signals were @xmath20nj ( @xmath2125% ) per pulse , while the measured laser energy was @xmath22j .    in tests of the _ field distribution _",
    ", an aspheric lens with a focal length of 4.5mm@xcite was used to create a collimated beam from the light source fiber into the 1:19 optical splitter .",
    "however it was found that the ( light source ) fiber speckle pattern resulted in a non - uniform light intensity within the collimated beam .",
    "one solution was to add a simple ground glass diffuser@xcite between the lens and the 1:19 splitter . while this decreased the the light intensity into the individual fibers of the 1:19 splitter , the net impact is on the design and positioning of the tank diffuser ( next paragraph ) .",
    "an alternate possibility ( yet to be studied ) is to reduce the amount of speckle by randomizing the polarization of the laser light at the source .",
    "the design of the tank light diffuser , mounted on the end of the optical fiber(s ) in each tank , has not been finalized .",
    "however estimates of the light intensity at the hawc tanks have been made by including all elements of the hawc calibration up to ( but not including ) the final tank optical diffusers .",
    "the resulting _ table top _ mock - up of the hawc calibration system included : the ( existing ) powerchip laser , @xmath19 beam expander , 1:37 fiber splitter , 2 x 150 m of @xmath12m/@xmath23 m optical fiber distribution , and the _ field distribution _ optics ( including the ground glass diffuser and 1:19 fiber splitter ) . including a @xmath24% quantum efficiency for the 8  hamamatsu pmts@xcite at the calibration wavelength of 532 nm , we expect @xmath17 pes in the pmts as long as the light coupling efficiency is @xmath25% between the calibration optical fiber ( diffuser ) and the 8  pmts .",
    "this argues for mounting the tank optical diffusers close to the pmts .",
    "this choice also minimizes possible pmt to pmt laser light time arrival differences from any light path length differences in the tanks .",
    "a _ table - top _ realization of the proposed hawc optical calibration system was set up to evaluate in detail the timing calibration of the hawc detector .",
    "the components of the calibration system have been tested for their performance , in particular their timing stability and the expected light intensity delivered to the individual tanks .",
    "no obstacles have been found .",
    "future efforts will focus on optimizing the light yield ( and fiber to fiber uniformity ) as well as the design of the tank diffuser and tank diffuser mounting plan .      jds uniphase _ powerchip nanolaser _ with a measured energy of @xmath26j / pulse at 532 nm .",
    "this is somewhat less than the original vendor specified energy of @xmath27j / pulse .",
    "this laser is now made by teem photonics@xcite ( below ) .",
