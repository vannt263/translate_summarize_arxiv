    "the precise determination of galactic open clusters main physical parameters plays a central role in the study of the stellar structure and evolution . with accurate photometric data , and",
    "once the external variables such as reddening are corrected for , the cluster distances , ages and chemical abundances can be inferred from the study of the photometric colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams .",
    "the usual way to obtain the cluster age is by means of isochrone fitting to the main sequence in a colour - magnitude diagram . in the case of young clusters -younger than 50 myr- isochrone fitting is made difficult by the usual presence of differential reddening across the cluster face , which widens the observed main sequence .",
    "moreover , the presence of emission line stars , like be o pms stars , which occupy anomalous positions in the photometric diagrams , additionally contributes to a further main sequence widening .",
    "hence , the fit of a particular isochrone can be a very uncertain process , and it is not difficult to find recent age determinations with very diverging values for a given young cluster .    in a recent paper , fabregat & torrejn ( @xcite ) propose the use of isochrone fitting in the @xmath8 plane of the @xmath9 photometric system as an adequate tool to obtain accurate cluster ages .",
    "the range of variation of the @xmath10 index along the b - type sequence amounts more than 1 mag .",
    ", being significantly larger than most common used photometric colours",
    ". moreover , the @xmath10 index is less affected by reddening , and allows an efficient segregation of emission - line stars .    in order to produce accurate and homogeneous dating for a sample of young galactic clusters",
    ", we have undertaken an observational programme to obtain ccd @xmath0 photometry . in this paper",
    "we present the first results , related to the clusters @xmath1 and @xmath2 persei .",
    "the double cluster and is one of the richest young open clusters in the galaxy , and also one of the brightest and closest to us . on a clear night , far from the light pollution , it can be easily seen with a naked eye , distinctly shining in the milky way between perseus and cassiopeia constellations . @xmath1 and @xmath2 persei ( and respectively )",

    "two modern studies based on ccd photometry , presented by keller et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and marco & bernabeu ( @xcite ) , converge in a common distance modulus of about 11.7 mag . for both clusters , but still present controversial results regarding their ages . the former finds a common age of log @xmath11 = 7.1 years for both clusters and the surrounding population , while the latter claims the existence of at least three different episodes of star formation . to contribute to ascertain",

    "the sequence of @xmath1 per is somewhat broader , most likely due to the variable reddening .    to obtain the distance we have fitted to the @xmath8 diagram of each cluster the zams as presented in table x of perry et al .",

    "( @xcite ) and marco & bernabeu ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , an indication of the validity of the dereddening procedure and the conformity between our photometry and the standard system can be obtained by comparing the resulting @xmath47 and @xmath48 indices with those of nearby , unreddened stars as given by perry et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ f7 ] and [ f8 ] .",
    "as it can be seen , the obtained indices are coincident with the mean intrinsic relations , and hence we can conclude that our photometry is in the standard system , and free of systematic effects .",

    "determination of the cluster ages will be done by isochrone fitting to the upper main sequence . in the @xmath9 system and for stars in the early group ,",
    "the @xmath49 colour and the @xmath10 index are temperature indicators , and hence both @xmath50 and @xmath8 planes are observational hr diagrams .",
    "following the discussion in fabregat & torrejn ( @xcite ) we consider more precise and reliable the isochrone fitting to the @xmath8 diagram , for the following reasons : i./ the range of variation of the @xmath10 index along the b - type sequence is more than ten times larger than the range of variation of @xmath49 , providing much better discrimination between isochrones of similar ages ; ii./ the @xmath10 index is less affected , by a factor of 5 , by interstellar reddening ; iii./ the @xmath8 plane allows an efficient segregation of emission line stars .    in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] we present the @xmath8 sequences of @xmath1 and @xmath2 per , together with isochrones with ages of @xmath51 7.0 , 7.1 and 7.2 years .",
    "the isochrones have been computed with the evolutionary models of schaller at al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and transformed to the observational plane by means of the relations obtained by torrejn ( @xcite ) .",
    "the best fitting in both clusters is obtained for @xmath51 7.1 , with most of the stars at the turnoff point lying between the @xmath51 7.0 and 7.2 isochrones .",
    "hence we propose @xmath7 as the common age of both clusters , in good agreement with the recent result of keller et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in a recent paper marco & bernabeu ( @xcite , hereinafter referred to as mb01 ) claimed that @xmath1 per is significantly older than @xmath2 per , and go further to propose three epochs of star formation within the double cluster at ages of log @xmath11 = 7.0 , 7.15 and 7.3 years .",
    "this is in clear disagreement with our results in the previous section .",
    "their study is also based on ccd @xmath9 photometry , and they use the same methods and techniques that we do in the present paper .",
    "hence , it is worth to compare both studies in order to ascertain the reasons of the diverging results .",
    "when comparing both sets of data , it should be noted that : i./ our standard photometry is at least twice as accurate as the mb01 one ( cf .",
    "table 9 in mb01 and table [ t3 ] in this paper ) , and ii./our ccd frames cover a larger area than mb01 ones , and hence our photometric sequences are more populated .",
    "mb01 find an age of log @xmath11 = 7.10  7.15 years for @xmath2 per , in agreement with our value of log @xmath11 = 7.10 obtained in the previous section .",
    "for @xmath1 per they obtain a significantly older age . in their fig .",
    "10 they show the log @xmath11 = 7.3 isochrone fitting a clump of stars at about @xmath52 , which they consider as the main sequence turnoff .",
    "this clump is also present in our data , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] where we present the @xmath8 plane and the the log @xmath11 = 7.1 and 7.3 isochrones . however , the distribution of stars in our fig . [ f10 ] near the turnoff point is different .",
    "the clump at @xmath52 is less conspicuous , it is only formed for at most six stars , and significantly leftwards to the fitting log @xmath11 = 7.3 isochrone there are at least eight main sequence cluster stars , which should have a younger age .",
    "we consider the latter as defining the actual cluster main sequence turnoff , which is well fitted by the log @xmath11 = 7.1 isochrone .",
    "the possibility of two distinct populations with log @xmath11 = 7.1 and 7.3 years seems very unlikely .",
    "the occurrence of stars slightly above the main sequence can be justified by several reasons , including binarity , high rotational velocity , or photometric errors . other small clump above the main sequence is apparent at @xmath53 , and it is also most likely caused by the above referred to reasons .",
    "mb01 also propose the presence of a population younger than log @xmath11 = 7.0 in the @xmath1 per region .",
    "this claim is based on the position in the @xmath54 plane of six supergiant b stars observed by crawford et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] we have also represented these stars ( filled triangles ) , which clearly fall at the left of the log @xmath11 = 7.1 isochrone .    but this argument is wrong .",
    "the @xmath55 index of the @xmath9 system is defined to be a measure of the balmer discontinuity depth , which for ob stars is related to the effective temperature . for this reason",
    ", the @xmath8 photometric plane can be considered as an observational hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "however , this is only true for stars of luminosity classes iii to v , and not for supergiants .",
    "crawford et al .",
    "( @xcite ) already note that ia type supergiants do not follow the mean @xmath31 calibration .",
    "schild & chaffee ( @xcite ) show that the balmer continuum of early type supergiants is affected by an emission or absorption contribution of circumstellar origin , and hence the balmer discontinuity depth is not correlated with spectral types or effective temperature .",
    "kilkenny & whittet ( @xcite ) present @xmath31 intrinsic relations for early type supergiants .",
    "there is a different relation for each luminosity class ( ia , iab , ib and ii ) , and all of them are in turn different to the mean relation for iii - v classes . if we assume that @xmath49 is a good temperature indicator for all luminosity classes ( see below ) , this implies that the @xmath10 index can not define a unique temperature scale valid for all luminosities .",
    "the case is much the same as for classical be stars .",
    "be stars also have continuum emission or absorption of circumstellar origin at the balmer discontinuity , and hence their @xmath10 indices are anomalous ( fabregat et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) . for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] we have represented the four be stars in the cluster nucleus ( filled circles ) . they also occupy anomalous positions at the left of the isochrones , and even below the zams .",
    "neither supergiants nor be stars should be used in a @xmath8 diagram when it is intended to be an observational hr diagram for isochrone fitting purposes , due that their @xmath10 index is not related with effective temperature .    in order to study the age of the supergiant star population in the @xmath1 per area , in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] we have represented the @xmath50 photometric diagram .",
    "@xmath21 is a measure of the paschen continuum slope , which is correlated with effective temperature for stars of all luminosity classes .",

    "@xcite ) . two supergiant stars , and , lie in the cluster nucleus , and have been dereddened as a function of their position in fig .",
    "the other four , , , and , are placed at the west of the cluster nucleus .",
    "following the discussion in sect .",
    "3 , we have used the value of @xmath56 in table [ t6 ] to obtain their intrinsic colours . in order to check the reliability of this value",
    ", we have calculated the individual reddening for all supergiant stars using the standard relations given by kilkenny & whittet ( @xcite ) .",

    "11 it is apparent that most of the supergiant stars lie close to the log @xmath11 = 7.1 isochrone , giving further support to this value as the actual age of @xmath1 per .",
    "there are no stars significantly leftwards to this isochrone , indicating that no younger population is present in the cluster area .",
    "mb01 also presented the @xmath50 plane for @xmath1 per ( their fig .",
    "9 ) . in their figure",
    "most supergiant stars are placed leftwards to the log @xmath11 = 7.0 isochrone , and even leftwards to the zams , indicating that these stars could be no members of the cluster .",
    "this is due to a reddening overcorrection .",
    "they used their mean cluster value , @xmath57 , to calculate the intrinsic colours .",
    "the deviating supergiants are placed at the west of the cluster nucleus , where we have demonstrated that the reddening is lower by more than a tenth of magnitude . with the proper reddening values supergiants are placed close to the cluster isochrone .",
    "we can conclude that there are no different epochs of star formation within the @xmath1 and @xmath2 persei clusters area , and that both clusters and the surrounding field stars share the same age of @xmath58 years , as determined in the previous sections .",
    "we propose that the wrong results obtained by mb01 are due to a number of factors , including the low accuracy of their photometry , the neglecting of the strongly variable reddening across the @xmath1 per cluster , the incorrect use of supergiant stars in the @xmath8 plane for isochrone analysis , and to a large extent the overinterpretation of the data at their disposal .",
    "as discussed in sect . 4 , and in more detail in fabregat & torrejn ( @xcite ) , the isochrone fitting in the @xmath8 plane is an excellent tool for accurate age determination in young open clusters .",
    "with accurate photometry , the main sequence turnoff is very well defined , allowing a precise discrimination between isochrones of slightly different ages . but",
    "its applicability is limited to the range of spectral types and luminosity classes for which the @xmath10 index is a good temperature indicator .",
    "this is restricted to ob stars of luminosity classes iii to v , and beyond this limits its use can conduct to misleading results .",
