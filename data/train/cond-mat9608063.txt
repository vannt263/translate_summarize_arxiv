    "a quantum dot @xcite is an isolated 2-d region of a few @xmath0 m or less in length to which @xmath1 electrons ( typically several hundreds ) are confined by an electrostatic potential .",
    "the dots can be weakly coupled via tunnel barriers to external leads in order to study their transport properties . for sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the conductance of the dot exhibits equally spaced peaks with increasing gate voltage @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained within a model @xcite where the leads are assumed to behave like electron reservoirs in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath2 and chemical potential @xmath3 , and the dot electrons are treated as a free fermi gas with the coulomb interaction taken into account only through charging effects . in this framework",
    "each successive peak corresponds to a single - electron tunneling event . for an additional electron to tunnel from the leads into the dot and occupy the ground state of the resulting @xmath4-electron gas",
    ", it has to overcome the coulomb repulsion energy of the dot electrons .",
    "@xmath3 must therefore increase from its value at the last tunneling event by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the capacitance between the dot and the reservoir and @xmath7 is the spacing between the single - particle energies @xmath8 .",
    "this condition provides a set of values @xmath9 at which tunneling is possible , resulting in peaks in the conductance @xmath10 of the dot .",
    "the suppression of tunneling between the peaks by coulomb repulsion is called coulomb blockade .    since the charging energy @xmath11",
    ", these peaks are equally spaced as a function of @xmath3 ( for @xmath12 ) and can be observed by increasing the gate voltage which controls @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting oscillations in the measured conductance are known as coulomb blockade oscillations . in the regime of isolated resonances @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the decay rate from the single - particle level @xmath15 into the leads , and for temperatures @xmath16 , the conductance is dominated by the contribution of the single level closest to @xmath3 . in the temperature regime @xmath17 ,",
    "the width of the peaks is @xmath18 independent of the individual decay rates .",
    "the peak amplitudes are found to fluctuate strongly @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations have been explained @xcite by a statistical theory based on the assumption that the hamiltonian of the dot can be described by random - matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "this assumption is valid either in the diffusive regime ( for weak disorder ) or when the classical dynamics of the electron inside the dot is chaotic @xcite due to irregularities in the confining potential .",
    "the full probability distribution of the conductance was derived in this framework and found to change dramatically when time reversal symmetry is broken due to the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have been probing the dot s conductance as a function of the external magnetic field or a changing shape .",
    "of particular interest are the correlations of the conductance peaks at different values of the external parameter ( magnetic field , shape , etc . ) . for ballistic cavities ( open dots ) , conductance correlations in a magnetic field were studied extensively , both theoretically for a large number of channels using the semiclassical approximation @xcite and the supersymmetry method @xcite , and experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently these correlations were measured also as a function of the dot s shape @xcite .",
    "such open dots are characterized by many overlapping resonances and exhibit properties that are analogous to ericson s fluctuations in nuclear reactions @xcite . however , until recently , very little was known about parametric conductance correlations in the coulomb blockade regime of isolated resonances , which is analogous to the neutron resonance regime in the compound nucleus @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the parametric correlation function of the conductance peaks @xmath19 where @xmath20 is any controllable parameter and @xmath21 is the conductance peak amplitude for a given value @xmath20 of the parameter . in ref .",

    "@xcite to study the statistics of avoided crossings in chaotic systems .",
    "universal parametric correlation of spectra ( e.g. level velocities ) have been derived in ref .",
    "however , the calculation of the conductance correlations requires knowledge of statistical properties of the eigenfunctions .",
    "the universality of all eigenfunction correlators , which implies in particular the universality of ( [ gparmcorr ] ) , was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "following our predictions , the conductance correlator has recently been measured for the situation of broken time - reversal symmetry where @xmath20 is a magnetic field @xcite and was found to be in good agreement with theory @xcite .",
    "the conductance distributions for one - channel symmetric leads were also measured @xcite recently and are in accord with the theoretical distributions derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a dot with reflection symmetry",
    "we derive an even more remarkable result : the conductance correlator is independent of the details of the channels in each lead such as their number and degree of correlations , and it reduces to the resonance width correlator for single - channel leads",
    ". however , the conductance correlations are sensitive to the absence or presence of a magnetic field . to demonstrate the universality of our results we test them in an anderson model of a disordered quantum dot .",
    "another problem that we address is the difficulty in performing the usual level velocity parameter scaling in experimental situations because of the inaccessibility of the spectrum , a coulomb blockade effect .",
    "one can trace the variation of the ground state energy of @xmath1 electrons in the dot as a function of the parameter by following the corresponding conductance peak .",
    "however it is not possible to measure the level spacing @xmath22 which is needed for the level velocity scaling .",
    "though @xmath22 may be estimated theoretically , e.g. from free fermi gas , its value may be modified by the electrons interaction .",
    "we find a new scaling procedure , with a scaling factor which depends on the eigenfunctions alone and can be extracted from the level width or the conductance peak@xcite .",
    "this should make it possible to extract the scaling directly from the conductance peaks data .",
    "the scaling factor is interpreted as the average rotation rate of the eigenvectors ( with respect to @xmath20 ) or as the rms conductance velocity .",
    "we remark that the conductance correlator in a symmetric dot is identical to the parametric correlator of the eigenfunction intensity at a fixed spatial point of a chaotic system , and therefore can also be measured in microwave cavity experiments@xcite .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",

    "iv we introduce the new scaling procedure based on the eigenfunction rotation rate .",
    "the scaling factor diverges logarithmically for the orthogonal case but we describe a way to regularize it . using perturbation theory , we derive analytically the width correlator at short distances and express the rotation scaling in terms of the rms of the width velocity .",
    "we also derive a semiclassical expression which is system - dependent for the rotation scaling and compute it for the case when the parameter is an external magnetic field .",
    "this gives us the magnitude of the correlation field .",
    "in section v we compute the universal distributions of the average width velocity for various values of the scaled @xmath25 . in section",
    "vi we discuss the universal parametric correlations of the conductance peaks in the general case of asymmetric dots with symmetric or asymmetric leads , and express the rotation scaling in terms of the rms of the conductance velocity . finally , our analytical results are verified in the completely solvable @xmath26 gp ( section vii ) .",
    "it is convenient to discuss the conductance of the dot in the framework of @xmath23-matrix theory , originally introduced for nuclear reactions that proceed through the compound nucleus formation and decay @xcite and more recently applied to quantum dots @xcite .",
