    "this is the third paper in a series aimed at understanding the structure of self - similar spherically symmetric wave maps coupled to gravity . in the first two papers  @xcite",
    "we showed that for small values of the coupling constant there exists a countable family of solutions that are analytic below the cauchy horizon of the central singularity . in this paper",
    "we wish to elaborate on the analysis of a periodic self - similar solution whose existence was only briefly mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "we tried to make this paper self - contained mathematically but we refer the reader to  @xcite for the discussion of the physical background of the problem and to  @xcite for more on the role of self - similar solutions in gravitational collapse .",
    "we showed in  @xcite that under the assumptions of spherical symmetry , equivariance and self - similarity the einstein equations coupled to the @xmath0 sigma field reduce to the following system of autonomous ordinary differential equations for three functions @xmath1 , and @xmath2 @xmath3 subject to the constraint @xmath4 physically the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 parametrize the metric , the function @xmath7 parametrizes the @xmath0 sigma field and @xmath8 is the dimensionless coupling constant ( @xmath9 corresponds to no gravity ) .",
    "we are interested in solutions of equations ( 1)-(4 ) starting at say @xmath10 with the following initial conditions ( as explained in  @xcite these conditions ensure regularity of solutions at the past light cone of the singularity ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a free parameter",
    "( since the system has reflection symmetry @xmath13 we may take @xmath14 without loss of generality ) .",
    "the value @xmath15 follows from the constraint ( 4 ) .",
    "in what follows we shall refer to solutions of equations ( 1)-(4 ) satisfying the initial conditions ( [ initial ] ) as @xmath12-orbits .",
    "we showed in  @xcite that for @xmath16 , @xmath12-orbits exist locally and are analytic in @xmath12 and @xmath17 .",
    "it follows immediately from ( 1)-(4 ) that a @xmath12-orbit can be continued as long as @xmath18 ( since then @xmath6 is bounded away from zero ) .",
    "however , if @xmath5 hits @xmath19 at some @xmath17 , then the solution becomes singular .",
    "now we shall show that generic @xmath12-orbits become singular in finite time . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath20 .",
    "we first show that if @xmath12 is small , then @xmath5 tends to -1 for some finite @xmath21 . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath22 .",
    "then , in the limit @xmath23 , equations ( 1)-(3 ) reduce to @xmath24 with the initial conditions @xmath25 the limiting equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are solved by @xmath26 and @xmath27 . substituting these solutions into ( 8) we get the equation",
    "@xmath28 whose solution ( which can be obtained in closed form ) behaves as @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the term @xmath31 in ( 6 ) stays bounded so , by uniform convergence on compact intervals , the solutions with sufficiently small @xmath12 will tend to @xmath32 .",
    "next , we show that if @xmath12 is large then @xmath5 tends to @xmath33 and @xmath34 for some finite @xmath35 .",
    "this time we define the variables @xmath36 then , in the limit @xmath37 , equations ( 1)-(3 ) reduce to ( where now prime is @xmath38 ) @xmath39 with the initial conditions @xmath40 it follows from ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) that , in the limit @xmath41 , @xmath42 . plugging this into equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , and using ( 15 ) , we get the limiting solution @xmath43 this solution becomes singular at @xmath44 . by uniform convergence on compact intervals , we conclude that for solutions of equations ( 1)-(4 ) with large @xmath12 ( and nonzero @xmath8 ) , the function @xmath45 attains a minimum and then tends to @xmath46 at some @xmath47 , while the function @xmath48 drops to zero at @xmath49 .",
    "to summarize , @xmath12-orbits tend in finite time to @xmath32 if @xmath12 is small , and to @xmath50 if @xmath12 is large . in what follows",
    ", we shall refer to these two kinds of solutions as to type @xmath6 and type @xmath51 orbits , respectively .",
    "we show next that the sets of type @xmath6 and type @xmath51 orbits are open .",
    "0.12 cm * lemma 1 . *",
    "if @xmath52 and @xmath53 for some @xmath54 then the orbit is of type b , i.e. , there is a finite @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 .",
    "0.12 cm _ proof : _ substituting equation ( 4 ) in ( 1 ) we get @xmath58 thus , if @xmath53 then @xmath59 so if @xmath52 then @xmath5 remains positive .",
    "but then by equation ( 2 ) @xmath6 decreases which implies by ( 17 ) that @xmath60 remains positive ( bounded away from zero in fact ) and hence @xmath5 must hit @xmath33 in finite time . to prove the second part of the lemma , note that by equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we have ( using the abbreviation @xmath61 )",
    "@xmath62 assume that @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath64 and since @xmath65 for @xmath66 we get a contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath67 .",
    "0.12 cm * corollary . *",
    "type b orbits are open .",
    "0.12 cm _ proof : _ if the @xmath68-orbit is of type b then by lemma  1 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for some @xmath54 .",
    "hence for nearby @xmath12 we also have @xmath71 and @xmath72 and thus , again by lemma  1 , the @xmath12-orbit is of type b. 0.12 cm * proposition 1 .",
    "* type a orbits are open .",
    "0.12 cm _ proof : _ first , note that if the orbit is of type a and @xmath73 then @xmath74 ( since otherwise the orbit would be of type b by lemma  1 ) . but for @xmath75 , by equation ( 2 ) @xmath76 , hence @xmath77 for @xmath78 where @xmath55 is the point at which @xmath79 .",
    "thus , @xmath80 for type a orbits .",
    "now , let @xmath68-orbit be of type a and consider a nearby @xmath12-orbit . by continuity",
    ", there is a point @xmath81 such that @xmath82 is close to @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is greater than , say , @xmath86 .",
    "first we show that such orbits have @xmath87 for all @xmath88 . to see this , notice that from equations ( 1)-(3 ) @xmath89",
    "hence at the first zero of @xmath90 after @xmath81 we have @xmath91 the numerator is negative because @xmath92 and @xmath5 is close to @xmath83 while the denominator is always positive , hence @xmath93 which is a contradiction .",
    "thus , @xmath87 and @xmath94 exists ( if the orbit stays in the region ) .",
    "now we show that @xmath95 for any such orbit for some @xmath96 . to prove this assume that @xmath97 . integrating equation ( 1 )",
    "we get @xmath98 which gives a contradiction as @xmath99 because the last integral in ( [ a ] ) is finite by equation ( 2 ) ( remember that @xmath6 is bounded from below ) .",
    "we now know that both type a and type b orbits are open so there must be orbits that are not type a or type b , that is , orbits that stay in @xmath100 for all @xmath17 .",
    "call these type c orbits .",
    "we note that type c orbits are defined for all @xmath101 since @xmath102 for all @xmath17 .",
    "0.11 cm * proposition 2 . * for any type c orbit we have @xmath103 0.11 cm _ proof : _ suppose that there is an @xmath81 such that @xmath104 for @xmath88 ( this is equivalent to @xmath105 ) .",
    "then from equation (  [ v ] ) @xmath106 for @xmath88 and hence @xmath107 for some @xmath96 which is a contradiction since @xmath108 for all @xmath17 .    similarly , suppose that there is an @xmath81 such that @xmath109 for @xmath88 ( this is equivalent to @xmath110 ) . from lemma  1",
    "we have that @xmath102 for @xmath88 .",
    "thus @xmath111 for @xmath88 which is a contradiction since by lemma  1 @xmath112 for all @xmath17 .    from proposition 2",
    "we see that type c orbits must oscillate at infinity about @xmath113 ( unless @xmath114 ) .",
    "0.1 cm once we know that type @xmath115 orbits exist we turn to their numerical construction .",
    "numerics indicates that the structure of type @xmath115 orbits is rather complicated for large @xmath8  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to small values @xmath116 , where the structure is simple .",
    "namely for each given @xmath8 there is a single critical value @xmath117 such that @xmath12-orbits tend to the attractor @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath51 ) if @xmath118 ( resp .",
    "@xmath119 ) and the @xmath120-orbit is of type @xmath115 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath120-orbit is a separatrix lying between two generic attractors @xmath6 and @xmath51 . in the next section",
    "we give numerical and analytical arguments that the @xmath120-orbit is asymptotically periodic .",
    "a straightforward way to determine the critical value @xmath120 is to take two values @xmath121 and @xmath122 leading to attractors @xmath6 and @xmath51 respectively and then fine - tune to @xmath120 by bisection .",
    "this procedure yields a pair of @xmath12 that are within a distance @xmath123 from @xmath120 ( where @xmath123 is limited by machine precision ) .",
    "such marginally critical @xmath12-orbits exhibit a transient periodic behavior before eventually escaping toward @xmath124 ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this suggests that the system has an unstable periodic solution and the @xmath120-orbit belongs to its basin of attraction . in other words",
    ", the value @xmath120 corresponds to the intersection of the line of initial data ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) with the 2-dimensional stable manifold of the periodic solution .",
    "in fact , if we take any two points @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the phase space which lead to attractors @xmath6 and @xmath51 , respectively , and perform bisection we obtain the same asymptotically periodic solution .",
    "this indicates that the stable manifold of the periodic solution is the boundary between the basins of attractors @xmath6 and @xmath51 .",
    "since the periodic solution is unstable and numerically it is impossible to set initial conditions exactly on the stable manifold , we can not obtain too many cycles of the periodic solution .",
    "although in our case this is not a serious difficulty because the positive lyapunov exponents are not large ( see figure 7 below ) , we would like to remark in passing that using so called straddle - orbit method due to battelino et al .  @xcite one can pursue the unstable periodic orbit in principle forever .",
    "this procedure , which can be viewed as a series of bisections , goes as follows . at initial time",
    "we choose two points @xmath130 and @xmath131 which lead to different attractors @xmath6 and @xmath51 and perform bisection until the distance between the iterates @xmath132 and @xmath133 is less a prescribed @xmath134 .",
    "next we integrate the equations numerically starting from the current @xmath132 and @xmath133 until the distance between the trajectories exceeds @xmath134 .",
    "when this happens at some time @xmath17 we stop the integration , assign the points @xmath135 and @xmath136 as current representatives and repeat the bisection .",
    "iterating this procedure one can progressively construct a trajectory staying within a distance @xmath134 from the codimension one stable manifold .",
    "the numerical solutions obtained by this method are shown in figures 3 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "using the fact that non - critical @xmath12-orbits become singular in finite time we can easily compute the positive lyapunov exponent @xmath137 of the periodic solution . to this end",
    "consider a marginally critical @xmath12-orbit with @xmath138 .",
    "such an orbit approaches the periodic solution , stays close to it for some time and eventually escapes along the unstable manifold to crash at a point @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath141 where @xmath142 , and @xmath143 denote the lengths of respective intervals of evolution ( we say that the solution `` escapes '' if its distance from the periodic attractor exceeds a prescribed value ) . during the periodic interval the distance between the @xmath12-orbit with @xmath138 and the periodic solution grows at the rate proportional to @xmath144 , hence @xmath145 .",
    "this implies that the number of cycles @xmath146 during this interval behaves as @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the period of the periodic solution . the length of the escape interval does not depend on the number of cycles but only on the phase of a cycle at which the escape from the periodic solution takes place , hence @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is a periodic function with period @xmath151 . summarizing",
    ", we have @xmath152 the numerical verification of this formula is shown in figure 6 . using ( [ wiggles ] )",
    "we calculated the dependence of @xmath137 on the coupling constant @xmath8 - the result is shown in figure 7 .",
    "in order to construct periodic solutions we consider equations ( 1)-(4 ) with initial conditions @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a free parameter and the value @xmath15 follows from the constraint ( 4 ) .",
    "we claim that for sufficiently small @xmath8 there is a unique @xmath154 such that @xmath155 for some @xmath156 . since the system is invariant under the shift @xmath157 , we call such solution periodic .",
    "now we shall construct the periodic solution in a perturbative way using the poincar - lindstedt method @xcite .",
    "we define the new variable @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the unknown in advance frequency .",
    "we remark that the rescaling of the independent variable by @xmath160 is essential in order to have a well - defined limit for @xmath161 while the rescaling by @xmath159 is introduced for convenience in order to have the fixed period @xmath162 . in terms of @xmath163 equations ( 1)-(3 )",
    "transform to @xmath164 @xmath165,\\\\ a'&=&-2\\omega\\beta a w f'^{2},\\\\ { \\omega}^{2}(af')'&=&\\beta^{2 } \\frac{\\sin(2f)}{w^{2}-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the constraint ( 4 ) becomes @xmath166 we consider these equations on the interval @xmath167 with the boundary conditions @xmath168 where the value of the constant @xmath169 follows from the constraint ( 28 ) .",
    "we seek solutions in the form of a power series in @xmath170 @xmath171 the key idea of the poincar - lindstedt method is to expand the frequency in the power series @xmath172 and to solve for the coefficients @xmath173 by demanding that the solution contains no secular terms .",
    "thus , we substitute ( [ series ] ) and ( [ seriesfreq ] ) into ( 25)-(28 ) , group the terms according to powers of @xmath170 and require that the coefficients of each power of @xmath170 vanish separately . in the lowest order @xmath174 we get @xmath175 where @xmath176 is yet undetermined . in the next order",
    "we get the equation @xmath177 , so to avoid a secular term we need to have @xmath178 .",
    "then , all @xmath179 terms are zero and in the order @xmath180 we get @xmath181 iterating this procedure with the help of mathematica we calculated the perturbation series up to order @xmath182 . for example , up to order @xmath183 we have @xmath184 we recall that the `` physical '' frequency is equal to @xmath185 so it diverges as @xmath170 tends to zero ( while the amplitude of oscillations goes to zero ) . in this sense",
    "the periodic solution is nonperturbative even though we constructed it by the perturbation technique .    for small values of @xmath170",
    "the perturbation expansion converges quickly to the periodic solution constructed numerically ( see figure 8) .",
    "as @xmath170 grows the convergence becomes slower and we need to take many terms in the perturbation series to approximate well the numerical solution ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "the fact that two independent ways of constructing the periodic solution agree , makes us feel confident that the periodic solution does in fact exist .",
    "we showed above that for small values of the coupling constant @xmath8 , the critical @xmath186-orbit is asymptotically periodic as @xmath99 . in the preceding papers [ 1,2 ] we showed that for a generic value of @xmath8 , the @xmath186-orbit evolved backwards in @xmath17",
    "becomes singular as @xmath187 ( which corresponds to the singularity at the center ) .",
    "however , there exist isolated values of @xmath8 ( called @xmath188 , @xmath189 ) for which the @xmath186-orbit is regular as @xmath187 . combining this with the result obtained above ,",
    "we conclude that for a finite set of isolated values @xmath188 ( satisfying @xmath190 ) the einstein - wave map equations admit self - similar solutions that are regular at the center and asymptotically periodic outside the past light cone .",
