    "over the past fifteen years , the field of extrasolar planets has moved from the fringes of science to become a central pillar of current and future astronomical studies .",
    "although the first extrasolar planets were discovered by radio observations of a pulsar ( wolszczan & frail  1992 ) , the vast majority of the over 170 known extrasolar planets orbit main sequence stars and were found using cross - dispersed echelle spectrographs at a dozen ground - based telescopes . the first detected extrasolar planet associated with a main sequence star , 51  peg ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) , ushered in a continuous stream of unexpected results on extrasolar planets , ranging from their extreme diversity (  hot jupiters \" , planets in very elongated orbits , multiple - jupiter - mass planetary systems ) to the recently discovered super - earth - mass planets around solar - type stars with orbital periods of a few days .",
    "a review of the field is given by marcy et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . these discoveries",
    "not only provide new challenges for the fields of planetary origins and evolution , but also indicate that a large sample of planets is required to obtain a full understanding of their nature .",
    "although the high - precision echelle doppler instruments have proven quite successful at detecting extrasolar planets , the current approach is costly and time - consuming because of the large telescopes required and the relatively low throughputs ( a few percent ) of the spectrographs as well as the limitation of observing one star at a time . a sample of approximately 5,000 stars ( generally the closest and brightest ones ) , including the 2000 n2k survey stars targeting for short period planets ( fischer et al . 2005 ) , has been monitored for planets with echelle instruments on a dozen telescopes , including most of the new generation large telescopes such as the keck , the very large telescope ( vlt ) , subaru , the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , and magellan .",
    "most of the target stars have visual magnitudes brighter than about 8.0 except the n2k targets stars with visual magnitudes brighter than about 10.5 ( fischer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "based on the current planetary detection rate of @xmath8 among solar type stars ( marcy et al .",
    "2005 ) , a few hundred planets will likely be detected over the next ten years using current techniques .",
    "given the surprising range of properties known to date ( and the likelihood of even larger surprises in the future ) , this sample will still be inadequate for giving us a comprehensive picture of planet formation and evolution and their relation to stellar properties such as mass , luminosity , spectral type , metallicity , duplicity , and age .",
    "furthermore , to monitor a large number of stars , one must move to targets with @xmath9 .",
    "an instrument with high throughput becomes critical to search for planets around fainter stars .",
    "in addition , an instrument with multiple object capability would greatly enhance the efficiency of any extrasolar planet survey .    a promising doppler technique for finding extrasolar planets , one that is quite different from the echelle approach , uses a dispersed fixed - delay interferometer ( dfdi ) for precision radial velocity measurements .",
    "the dfdi offers high throughput and multi - object capability . instead of measuring the absorption line centroid shifts in the echelle approach",
    ", a dfdi determines the radial velocity by monitoring interference fringe phase shifts .",
    "the idea for using a fixed - delay interferometer for high precision doppler measurements was first proposed by solar astrophysicists in the 1970s and 1980s to measure solar oscillations ( barker & hollenbach 1972 ; gorskii & lebedev 1977 ; beckers & brown 1978 , kozhevatov 1983 ) .",
    "this approach was adopted by the global oscillations network group ( gong ) interferometer ( harvey et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the gong interferometer , with a narrow passband ( @xmath10  ) , has produced very high doppler precision measurements of the sun ( sub m  s@xmath1 precision for the gong measurements ; harvey  2002 , private communication ) .",
    "the concept of combining a fixed - delay interferometer with a moderate resolution spectrometer for broad band operations for high precision stellar doppler measurements was proposed in 1997 by david erskine at lawrence livermore national lab .",
    "the initial lab experiments and telescope observations successfully demonstrated the dfdi concept [ earlier this concept was called fringing spectrometer and externally dispersed interferometer ( edi ) , erskine & ge 2000 ; ge , erskine & rushford 2002 ] .",
    "the theory for dfdi is described in ge  ( 2002 ) . in 2002 a prototype dfdi instrument , designated as the exoplanet tracker ( et ) , was used at the kpno 2.1  m telescope to reproduce the radial velocity curve of the known planet orbiting the solar type star 51  peg ( van eyken et al .",
    "2004a ) , demonstrating the capability of this new approach for planet detection . a new version of the et instrument , optimized for high throughput and relatively large wavelength coverage compared to the 2002 prototype ,",
    "was commissioned at the kpno 0.9  m coud feed and 2.1  m telescopes in 2003 november ( ge et al .",
    "2004 ; van eyken et al .",
    "the first dfdi multi - object observations , using a modified et , were obtained in 2005 march at the 2.5  m sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) telescope ( york et al . 2000 ; gunn et al .",
    "2006 ) at apache point observatory ( ge et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report the first detection of a new extrasolar planet using the dfdi technique .",
    "the planet , hd  102195b ( et-1 ) , associated with the star hd  102195 , has an orbital period of 4.11  days and was discovered with et at the kpno 0.9  m coud feed and 2.1  m telescopes .",
    "the planet survey instrumentation and observations are reviewed in section  2 , and a description of the survey data processing is provided in section  3 .",
    "section  4 presents additional radial velocity , spectroscopic , and photometric observations of hd  102195 .",
    "an analysis of the radial velocity curve and follow - up data of hd  102195 and a brief discussion of the properties of et-1 are given in sections  5 and  6 , respectively .",
    "in the winter of 2004 we began a small - scale extrasolar planet survey at kpno using the dfdi approach .",
    "this program is designed to detect new planets with short orbital periods targets were chosen primarily from the nstar catalogue ( gray et al .",
    "2003 ) , selecting dwarf stars of type fgk with stars that were known to be fast rotators or had high activity indicators were removed from the sample , as were any known visual doubles or variables . since studies have shown a strong correlation between frequency of planetary systems and high metallicity in the star ( e.g. , gonzalez 1997 ; reid 2002 ; santos et al . 2004 ; fischer & valenti 2005 ) , we selected relatively high metallicity stars to increase the planet detection efficiency .",
    "below we present a brief outline of the dfdi instrument , et , of which a more detailed description can be found in van eyken et al  ( 2004b ) .",
    "et includes a single object fiber feed system , a michelson type interferometer with a fixed optical delay in one of the arms , a spectrograph with a volume phase holographic ( vph ) grating , and a 4k@xmath114k ccd camera with 15  @xmath12 m pixels . an optical fiber with a 200  @xmath12 m core diameter ( 2.5@xmath13 on the sky )",
    "is fed by an @xmath14 beam from the kpno 0.9  m coud feed or 2.1  m telescope ( both telescopes are housed in the same enclosure and feed the same spectrograph , so the instrument does not have to be relocated ) .",
    "the fiber has an @xmath15 output beam .",
    "et is designed to operate from 50005640   and has a spectral resolving power of @xmath165,100 .",
    "a resolution element is sampled by 6.7  pixels in the dispersion direction .",
    "each fringe is sampled by @xmath17 pixels in the slit direction ; this range usually includes @xmath18 periods of fringing .",
    "the vph grating is a dickson type design , which produces a 92% peak grating efficiency but with a limited grating operation band of @xmath19  .",
    "the ccd camera was purchased from spectral instrument inc .",
    "the detector is a back - illuminated ccd with @xmath20% quantum efficiency in the et operating wavelengths .",
    "the measured instrument throughput from the fiber output to the detector is 49% . the overall average detection efficiency , including the telescope , seeing , fiber , instrument and detection losses , is 18% under typical seeing conditions ( @xmath16  1.5@xmath13 ) at the kpno coud feed/2.1  m. an iodine vapor glass cell 150  mm long and 50  mm in diameter is used as a doppler zero - velocity reference .",
    "the cell temperature is stabilized to since 2003 , we have been able to recover the expected rv signatures of known planets routinely with the et instrument ( see figure  1 ) and have obtained short term ( two day ) precision as high as 3.6  m  s@xmath1 ( photon noise limited ) on the bright rv stable star 36  uma ( van eyken et al .",
    "the instrument long term precision has not been well chacterized yet .",
    "the preliminary rv measurements over two months show that the instrument is at least stable to @xmath16 13  m  s@xmath1 .",
    "the initial et planet survey of 90 stars without previous precision radial velocity observations was conducted during the period 2004 december2005 may with the kpno 0.9  m coud feed from december to march and the 2.1-m telescope in may . a total of 59 nights of the coud feed time and 7 nights of 2.1-m time were allocated to the program .",
    "observations on 43 nights were obtained during the survey ( losses were primarily due to poor weather ) .",
    "the survey was divided into five observation blocks , each of @xmath16  10 nights duration .",
    "star and iodine templates were obtained at the beginning and end of each block ( van eyken et al .",
    "for a typical block , 56 rv measurements were acquired for each survey star .",
    "the rv data were taken with the iodine vapor cell in the stellar beam .",
    "the instrument was set to the same configuration during each observation block to maximize the instrument stability .",
    "the interferometer fringe pattern was stablized by a closed - loop , actively - controlled piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) system connected to one of the interferometer arms .",
    "the fringe pattern was monitored with a stablized hene laser at 0.6328  @xmath12 m purchased from melles griot inc . to measure the illumination profile and the spectral line slant for each fringe",
    "while maximizing the instrument stability , the interferometer fringes were jittered at the beginning and the end of each observation block to produce non - fringe calibration data .",
    "the jitter of the interferometer fringes was produced by operating the interferometer pzt ramp generators at about 10  hz . the interferometer phase was locked during the observations in each block .",
    "the instrument room was heated to @xmath1624@xmath21c , and the rms temperature fluctuation during the runs was approximately 0.1@xmath21c .",
    "the absolute velocity drift due to the temperature fluctuation and mechanical instability is about 12 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this velocity drift is calibrated and corrected with the iodine absorption line fringes .",
    "typical individual exposure times are @xmath1625 min for @xmath22 and @xmath1640 min for @xmath23 stars at the coud feed ; typical exposure times for the 2.1  m are 10  min for all targets .",
    "the average rms rv precision ( photon noise ) at the coud feed a total of @xmath16650 et observations of 90 stars were obtained during this campaign .",
    "the data produced by et required the development of a large software processing system . in this section",
    "we briefly outline the steps required to extract precision rv measurements from the raw data recorded by the detector .",
    "the main steps in the processing of the et fringe spectra are ( 1 )  image pre - processing , ( 2 )  sinusoid fitting , and ( 3 )  rv shift determination .    * preprocessing * : image preprocessing is performed with a combination of standard iraf procedures and proprietary software written in research systems inc s idl data analysis language .",
    "the steps consist of the following :    background subtraction / trimming : detector bias and background light calibration images ( dark plus stray light ) are first subtracted from the raw data .",
    "an attempt is made to remove as much internally scattered light as possible by fitting a smooth function to the dark areas of the images and using a one - dimensional interpolation scheme to estimate the scattered light levels in the areas covered by the spectra .",
    "the two - dimensional frames are then trimmed into new two - dimensional frames including only fringe spectra .",
    "flatfielding : pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations are corrected by dividing the data by a flatfield calibration image taken with a tungsten lamp .",
    "the irregular illumination of the spectrum is repaired by the application of a ` self illumination correction ' algorithm .",
    "this process constructs a second flatfield by extracting the underlying illumination function from each individual image ( see van eyken et al .",
    "2004a ) .",
    "slant correction : an algorithm is applied to correct for misalignment of the spectral lines with the rows / columns of the ccd .",
    "this feature is caused by a combination of imperfect alignment of the ccd and by aberration and distortion in the instrument optics ( i.e. , a simple rotation will not correct the alignment over the entire detector ) .",
    "this step is essential to obtain the proper cuts along the wavelength channels required to obtain uniform fringes .",
    "low pass filtering : finally , a one - dimensional , low - pass fourier filter is applied to the data in the dispersion direction .",
    "this action removes the interferometer comb , the pattern of parallel lines that is created by the continuum and therefore contains no doppler information .    * phase and visibility determination * : once the initial image processing is complete , the phases and visibilities of each wavelength channel ( column ) are measured .",
    "this is achieved simply by fitting a sine wave to each wavelength channel in the image with a standard @xmath24 minimization algorithm .",
    "the fit is weighted according to the number of counts in the original non - flatfielded data , on the assumption of photon noise dominated error .    to determine the phase accurately , two passes of the curve - fitting",
    "are performed to determine the fringe frequency .",
    "the first pass determines the frequencies of each channel .",
    "a polynomial is then fit to the frequencies as a function of wavelength ( weighted according to the measurement errors ) .",
    "the process is repeated a second time but with the frequencies fixed to match this function .",
    "this approach was found to significantly improve the final precision .    * determining the intrinsic doppler shift * : once the phase and visibility values are obtained for all wavelength channels , we combine them to form a vector vs. wavelength channel called a whirl , where each vector represents the fringe amplitude and phase ( see the definition in erskine & ge 2000 ) . in general , the star+iodine data whirl will be a linear vector combination of the iodine and star template whirls , where the template whirls are rotated in phase by an amount that must be determined .",
    "a set of four simultaneous linear equations can be constructed for each pair of channels ( erskine 2003 ) .",
    "the solution for the phase rotations is found by linearizing the complete overdetermined set of equations across all channels and using singular value decomposition .",
    "this procedure returns a @xmath25best fit solution \" along with standard error estimates .",
    "the measured rotations correspond to the star shift and the intrinsic instrument shift .",
    "the difference between these two rotations yield the intrinsic stellar rv shift .",
    "in addition to the two phase rotations , several additional degrees of freedom are allowed in our processing . in particular , we allow for bulk shift of the entire spectrum in the dispersion direction .",
    "this change can be produced by a doppler shift or by movement of the ccd detector due to thermal flexure .",
    "this , along with additional flexures in the instrument optics , can create translations of the image .",
    "a reduced @xmath24 value is determined between the star+iodine data and the best superposition of the pixel - shifted and rotated templates .",
    "this process is iterated until a minimum is reached in the reduced @xmath24 .    after correcting for instrument drift , it still remains to apply a barycentric correction to the velocities to account for the motion of the earth .",
    "this is done using our own software written in idl .",
    "diurnal motion is corrected using an algorithm adapted from the iraf procedure rvcorrect in the noao package .",
    "annual motion is corrected using the baryvel routine from the idl astronomy library ( ref .",
    "http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov ) , which is based on the algorithm from stumpff ( 1980 ) .",
    "at the completion of the data processing , the 90 stars in the survey fell into three catagories : ( 1 ) 75 of the stars exhibited less than 2.5@xmath26 rv scatter about a mean value ; ( 2 ) 10 stars had rv variations between 2.5@xmath26 and 1000  m  s@xmath1 rms about the mean ; and ( 3 ) 5 stars were spectroscopic binaries with rv variations larger than 1000 m s@xmath1 rms .",
    "only stars in the second group were considered candidates for harboring a planet and , of those ten stars , hd  102195 appeared to be the most promising candidate .",
    "having identified hd  102195 as the most promising planetary - candidate star from our initial exoplanet tracker survey , we embarked on a series of additional observations of hd  102195 to determine the nature of the rv variations .",
    "we obtained further precision rv measurements as well as high - resolution spectroscopy , ca  ii h  and  k emission - line spectroscopy , and high - precision photometry .",
    "the initial 14 coud measurements of hd  102195 with the et had an rms variation of slightly more than 60  m  s@xmath1 , with typical single - measurement errors of 20  m  s@xmath1 .",
    "an additional 14 et measurements were made in 2005 may with the kpno 2.1  m telescope and the same et instrument .",
    "figure  2 displays all 28 spring 2005 et radial velocities of the star and confirms hd  102195 as a good planetary candidate host star .",
    "the kpno 2.1  m et system was used again in 2005 december to obtain an additional 21 rv measurements of hd  102195 .",
    "we also acquired 10 rv measurements of the star between 2005 november and 2006 january with the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) of the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) ( ramsey et al .",
    "2006 ) to confirm the et results .",
    "the het / hrs data were obtained with a 2@xmath13 fiber and exposure times of 10 minutes .",
    "these observations were conducted with the hrs @xmath27 cross - dispersed echelle mode .",
    "this is the standard hrs configuration for precision rv measurements , and the data were processed with the techniques described in cochran et al .",
    "the het observations , which have typical internal errors of were able to be timed for maximum phase leverage because of the queue - scheduled operation of the telescope .",
    "all 59 precision rv measurements of hd  102195 from all sources are presented in table  1 .",
    "a total of nine high - resolution ( @xmath28 ) spectra of hd  102195 were obtained with the sarg spectrograph on the 3.5  m tng telescope at la palma on 2005 june 19 , 20 , and 21 .",
    "the wavelength coverage is complete from 3700    to 10000  .",
    "these data were used to monitor line - bisector variations , to determine stellar properties ( metallicity , @xmath29 , t@xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , and to search for any evidence of a second set of lines in the system .",

    "figure  3 shows a section of the sarg data centered at a wavelength of  6140   .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for each spectrum is about 100 per pixel . the nine spectra were normalized and fitted with synthetic spectra to derive the stellar parameters .",
    "the average values of the derived parameters are reported in section 5.1 .",
    "the nine spectra were searched for line bisector variations , but no significant variations were found over the three days .",

    "could three similar starspot groups spaced approximately 120  in longitude on the star be responsible for the observed radial velocity period ? figure  9 shows that there is essentially no power in the brightness variations at 4.11 days ( corresponding to a frequencey of 0.24 cycles per day ) .",
    "conversely , an examination of figure  7 shows that there is essentially no power in the radial velocity variations at the photometric period of 12.3  days .",

    "the analysis of the chromospheric activity traced by the s index does not show any variability at the 4.11 day period of the planet , but does display longer term changes that appear consistent with the photometric rotation period . the mean s@xmath107 index for the entire run is measured to be 0.024 , and varies from 0.023 to 0.025 . for comparison , in the reference star , tau ceti , the s index measuremtn varies less than 0.0005 .",
    "this result further suggests that stellar activity is not the source of the detected rv signals .",
    "in addition , the stellar rotation period measured from the photometry is consistent with the projected rotation velocity measured from the spectral analysis of the sarg and foces high resolution spectra .",
    "the measured corresponds to a maximum rotation period of @xmath108  days if a stellar radius of 0.84  r@xmath52 is adopted .",
    "this does indicate that the stellar rotation axis may be close to an inclination of 90 .",
    "however , as discussed in  5.5 above , photometric transits have been ruled out by our photometry .",
    "this planetary detection is the first time an extrasolar planet has been discovered via rv variations around a star fainter than @xmath109 with a sub - meter aperture telescope .",

    "the echellette can also increase the spectral resolution due to its higher dispersion over the low single - order blazed grating . since the doppler sensitivity is roughly proportional to the square root of the spectral resolution and wavelength coverage ( ge  2002 ) , it is likely that an et interferometer coupled with a cross - dispersed echellette will increase the doppler sensitivity by a factor of @xmath1635 times over current designs .    in summary ,",

    "<S> we report the detection of the first extrasolar planet , et-1 ( hd 102195b ) , using the exoplanet tracker ( et ) , a new generation doppler instrument . </S>",
    "<S> the planet orbits hd  102195 , a young star with solar metallicity that may be part of the local association . </S>",
    "<S> the planet imparts radial velocity variability to the star with a semiamplitude of @xmath0  m  s@xmath1 and a period of 4.11 days . the planetary minimum mass ( @xmath2 ) is @xmath3  @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the planet was initially detected in the spring of 2005 with the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 0.9  m coud feed telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the detection was confirmed by radial velocity observations with the et at the kpno 2.1  m telescope and also at the 9  m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) with its high resolution spectrograph . this planetary discovery with a 0.9  m telescope around a @xmath5 magnitude star </S>",
    "<S> was made possible by the high throughput of the instrument : 49% measured from the fiber output to the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the et s interferometer - based approach is an effective method for planet detection . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the et concept is adaptable to multiple - object doppler observations or very high precision observations with a cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph to separate stellar fringes over a broad wavelength band .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to spectroscopic observations of hd  102195 , we obtained brightness measurements with one of the automated photometric telescopes ( apts ) at fairborn observatory . </S>",
    "<S> those observations reveal that hd  102195 is a spotted variable star with an amplitude of @xmath6  mag and a @xmath7 day period . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with spectroscopically observed ca  ii h  and  k emission levels and line broadening measurements but inconsistent with rotational modulation of surface activity as the cause of the radial velocity variability . </S>",
    "<S> our photometric observations rule out transits of the planetary companion . </S>"
