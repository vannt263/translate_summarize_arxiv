    "the 2004 sumatra tsunami struck the indian ocean and presented a wake - up call around the globe for improved preparedness and awareness for tsunamis @xcite and other coastal hazards . in its aftermath , many countries initiated the assessment or , in some cases reassessment , of their tsunami risks which mainly have been based on the maximum runup determination .",
    "@xcite has been broadly referenced for this purpose , who developed an analytical model for non - breaking waves runup",
    ". however , the approach for breaking analysis must be numerical due to its complexity .    in their report for u.s .",
    "coastlines , @xcite mentioned the importance of numerical modeling in hazard assessments to quantify the impacts of future events .",
    "it has been recognized that as long as waves are not breaking , boussinesq and shallow water equations can be applied to simulate tsunami wave dynamics .",
    "especially the boussinesq equations are appropriate to study the wave approach and the runup process , and significant efforts have been made to include the proper dispersive terms @xcite . for a better representation of the flow field characteristics with boussinesq equations , @xcite proposed to use multiple layers along the vertical direction .",
    "however , such a multi - layer high - order boussinesq model is computationally expensive .",
    "furthermore , very close to the coast where the waves break , the irrotational assumption , which is appropriate for non - breaking waves , is violated .",
    "therefore , to fully understand and comprehensively study the very near - shore dynamics and effects of tsunami waves is better to explore with three - dimensional computational models .",
    "additionally , @xcite also highlighted that the runup value alone might not be appropriate to quantify the damage caused by tsunamis .",
    "runup describes the inundated area to the first order and can be employed for a large - scale overview of what happens after a tsunami strikes .",
    "however , runup values might not be sufficient to explore better coastal management strategies and solutions .    in this contribution",

    "note that the slopes of the curves are negative as the waves approaches the shoreline until the rundown starts .",
    "the more vertical the slope of the curve , the slower the wave front and vice versa .",
    "so , if the slope of the curve is less steep , then there is acceleration of the wave front .",
    "these accelerations occur between the squares and circles ( fig . 5 , 6 , 7 and 8) . the higher the @xmath41 ratio , the higher the intensity of the acceleration of the wave front .",
    "the presence of wave front acceleration during breaking is related to wave shoaling and has implications in the spatio - temporal evolution of the flow momentum , flow kinetic energy and flow force .",
    "while shoaling , as the wave becomes higher and steeper , the maximum flow momentum also increases .",
    "the maximum elevation of the wave crest generates the absolute maximum of the flow momentum ( squares in fig .",
    "[ curves ] , fig .",
    "[ maxima]a and fig .  [ space]a ) .",
    "after this absolute maximum , the maximum flow momentum decreases because the wave becomes lower and the water depth shallower .    for flow kinetic energy",
    "we observe that the largest velocities of the wave tip occur during breaking .",
    "however , the averaged velocity of the wave tip segment is not the largest because the averaging also considers slower water located deeper .",
    "the maximum flow kinetic energy reaches its absolute maximum when the water becomes shallower ( circles in fig .",
    "[ maxima]b ) .",
    "it is important to note that circles in fig .",
    "[ maxima]b are also the locations where wave front and wave crest converge .    when the absolute maximum flow momentum occurs ( squares in fig .",
    "[ maxima]a ) , the maximum kinetic energy at that time is very low compared with its absolute maximum ( circles in fig .",
    "[ maxima]b ) .",
    "conversely , when the flow is at its absolute maximum kinetic energy ( circles in fig .",
    "[ maxima]b ) , the maximum flow momentum at that time is very low compared with its absolute maximum ( squares in fig .",
    "[ maxima]a ) . additionally , the water depth is shallow where the absolute maxima of the flow kinetic energy occur .",
    "hence , although the kinetic energy is involved in the dangerousness of the tsunamis , it is not the only one to be considered .",
    "the maximum flow momentum and especially the maximum flow force should also be taken into account .    by analyzing the evolutions of maximum flow momentum and the maximum kinetic energy ,",
    "we observe that the second peak of the maximum momentum ( fig .",
    "6a ) almost coincides with the first peak of the maximum kinetic energy ( fig .",
    "6b ) and concurs with the sharp increment of the maximum kinetic energy ( fig .",
    "7a and 7b ) . from hereon ,",
    "the aim is to employ a variable that has an absolute maximum at points where the maximum flow momentum and maximum flow kinetic energy have their local maxima that is nearly coincident both spatially and temporally .",
    "figures  [ maxima]c and [ space]c depicts the spatio - temporal evolution of the above mentioned variable which is given by the flow force",
    ". the triangles in both figures are points of absolute maximum of flow force which synchronizes with local maxima of flow momentum and flow kinetic energy .",
    "the absolute maximum of the flow force appears just after the wave tip falls down on the water surface .",
    "this fall down causes a highly chaotic and turbulent layer of flow with significantly higher velocity at the surface and its vicinity .",
    "this process suddenly increases the kinetic energy ( first sharp increase in fig .  [ maxima]b and in fig .",
    "[ space]b ) and the water level which leads to an increase in the flow momentum ( local maxima peaks in fig .",
    "[ maxima]a and fig .  [ space]a ) .",
    "both together lead to the absolute maximum of the flow force ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ maxima]c and fig .  [ space]c ) .",
    "this location and time is when the flow becomes the most turbulent and dangerous .",
    "absolute maximum of flow force occurs just before shoreline ( triangles around @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ space]c . )",
    "regardless of the @xmath41 ratio of the wave . for the larger waves , @xmath41 = 0.45 , 0.40 and 0.35 runs , secondary peaks are present following the absolute maxima of the flow force , adding extra hazards .",
    "these results have to be considered in the shoreline facilities design .",
    "figure  [ lines]a depicts the absolute maxima of the flow force as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "this figure allows to estimate the absolute maximum flow force for any solitary wave not studied in this work with the same setup .",
    "additionally , fig .",
    "[ lines]b and [ lines]c provide the location and time respectively of the absolute maximum of flow momentum ( squares ) , the absolute maximum of flow kinetic energy ( circles ) and the absolute maximum of flow force ( triangles ) . the larger the @xmath41 ratio is , the larger the distance between squares and circles gets ( see fig .  [ lines]b and fig .",
    "[ lines]c ) and also the longer the breaking process takes and the farther the runup reaches .",
    "therefore by knowing the @xmath41 ratio of any solitary wave , it is possible to estimate not only the magnitude of the flow force , but also its occurrence spatially and temporally .",
    "in this study , we carried out numerical simulations with a non - depth integrated formulation of solitary waves to study their hazards during their proximity to the shoreline . because wave breaking is a three - dimensional process , neither the shallow water equations nor the boussinesq approximations can describe breaking analysis accurately .",
    "we approached this by averaging momentum , kinetic energy and force of the flow in segments along @xmath22 axis and by obtaining their maxima evolutions from three - dimensional sph simulations .",
    "figure 5 shows the wave front paths for different @xmath41 ratios . from fig . 6 and 7",
    "we obtain the locations and time of the absolute maxima of flow momentum , flow kinetic energy and flow force for various @xmath41 . when these points are plotted on fig .",
    "5 they appear on the curve of their respective @xmath41 wave path .",
    "this implies that the absolute maximum of flow momentum , the absolute maximum of flow kinetic energy and the absolute maximum of flow force always occur in the wave front , regardless of the @xmath41 ratio .",
    "so we conclude that the wave front will always be the most dangerous part of the tsunami at any time regardless of the @xmath41 wave ratio .",
    "also we conclude that flow force is the most important variable to utilize , over the flow momentum or flow kinetic energy , in order to identify the tsunamis dangerousness during breaking .",
    "this is mainly because the peaks of the absolute maxima of the flow force occur at points of nearly simultaneous local maxima of flow momentum and flow kinetic energy .",
    "this also occurs regardless of their @xmath41 ratio .",
    "the absolute maximum flow force for any @xmath41 occurs just before the shoreline .",
    "it denotes that the areas where the absolute maximum flow force occurs are most prone to hazards during the breaking and inundation processes .",
    "these conclusions render a better understanding of the breaking process and let us identify the physical variables that must be considered to evaluate the destructive hazards of solitary waves in space and time .",
    "also they provide important considerations to be taken into account to develop more reliable tsunami - risk evaluations in order to protect marine infrastructures and human lives .",
