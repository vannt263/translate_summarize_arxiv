    "the study of complex networks has been one of the most popular topics for many research fields in the last decade @xcite .",
    "this activity has been drown by the discoveries of the _ small - world _ @xcite and the _ scale free _ ( sf ) @xcite properties , which are common to many real networks , e.g. , internet , www , social networks , food - webs .",
    "the former means the ( sub-)logarithmic dependence of the mean shortest distance @xmath9 between nodes with network size @xmath0 as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) @xcite , and the latter a power - law tail in the degree distribution @xmath12 , where the degree @xmath13 is the number of edges connected to a node .",
    "the dynamics on complex networks , such as percolation , epidemic processes , interacting spin systems , coupled oscillators , have been extensively studied with stimulating our interests for the relationships between network topology and critical phenomena @xcite . in most analytical approaches _ locally tree - like approximation _ is used to give many detailed physical pictures about critical phenomena on some network models , particularly , on uncorrelated sf networks @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", many works have reported that systems on some growing networks show quite different phase transitions @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the percolation on some growing network models undergoes an _",
    "infinite order transition _ with a _ bkt - like singularity _ ; ( i ) the relative size of the giant component vanishes in an essentially singular way at the transition point , so that the transition is of infinite order , and ( ii ) the mean number @xmath14 of clusters with size @xmath2 per node ( or the cluster size distribution in short ) decays in a power - law fashion with @xmath2 in the whole region where no giant component exists .",
    "similar transitions are observed for the interacting spin systems on a hierarchical sf network @xcite , and an inhomogeneous growing network @xcite .",
    "the above unusual disordered phase is thought to be the same as the critical phase @xcite , which is also called _ patchy _ phase @xcite , observed on hierarchical sf networks and the hanoi networks . by renormalization group ( rg ) techniques , berker et al .",
    "@xcite have studied bond percolations on the decorated ( 2,2)-flower @xcite , which is one of hierarchical sf networks , to show the existence of a critical phase , where rg flow converges onto the line of nontrivial stable fixed points .",
    "let us turn our eyes upon exotic but regular graphs for a while .",
    "critical phenomena on _ nonamenable graphs _",
    "( nags ) , which are defined as graphs with positive cheeger constant , have been studied in recent years @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , nags are regular graphs having small - world property @xmath10 . hyperbolic lattices and regular trees are typical examples of nags .",
    "it has been predicted that the bond percolation on a nag exhibits a _ multiple phase transition _ ( mpt ) which takes three distinct phases according to the open bond probability @xmath4 as follows ; ( i ) the non - percolating phase ( @xmath15 ) in which only finite size clusters exist , ( ii ) the critical phase ( @xmath16 ) in which there are infinitely many infinite clusters , and ( iii ) the percolating phase ( @xmath17 ) in which the system has a unique infinite cluster . here _",
    "infinite cluster _ means a cluster whose mass diverges with system size @xmath0 as @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "recent paper @xcite ( see also @xcite ) performed monte - carlo simulations for the bond percolation on the enhanced binary tree , which is one of nags , to show that the system undergoes the mpt , and the critical phase has the following properties ; ( i ) continuously increasing of the fractal exponent @xmath6 with @xmath4 , where @xmath6 is defined as @xmath20 @xmath21 being the mean size of cluster to which the root node belongs ( hereafter we refer to this cluster as the root cluster ) , and ( ii ) the cluster size distribution @xmath14 always having a power - law tail @xmath22 with @xmath4-dependent @xmath5 satisfying @xmath23 we already know that standard systems on the euclidean lattices ( which are amenable ) have just one critical _ point _ and no critical _ phase _ @xcite , while it is unclear and rarely discussed so far whether percolations or other processes on complex networks have such a critical _ phase _ or not .    the aim of this paper is to connect two concepts , unusual phase transitions on growing networks and the mpt on nags .",
    "for this purpose we analyze the bond percolation on the _ growing random tree _ ( gr tree ) @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , growing networks are expected to show a criticality in the region where its order parameter takes zero , while it is also trivial that any tree has no ordered phase due to the absence of loops .",
    "thus , systems on the gr tree are always critical in the whole range of @xmath4 ( except @xmath24 ) .",
    "we show analytically that the exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 change continuously with the open bond probability @xmath4 , with satisfying the scaling relation ( [ relation ] ) .",
    "we also perform the monte - carlo simulation to show that finite size scaling for @xmath14 is quite well fitted for any @xmath4 , irrespective of the degree exponent @xmath7 .",
    "a realization t@xmath25 of the gr tree with @xmath0 nodes is obtained as a tree at time @xmath26 generated by a stochastic process as follows : one starts at time @xmath27 with t@xmath28 consisting of just one isolated node which we call the initial node or the root ( for later convenience it is connected to a dangling bond so that the initial degree is @xmath29 ) . at each time step , a new node is added and linked to t@xmath25 to make t@xmath30 ( see figure [ netgrowth ] ) . the probability that the new node is linked to a node of t@xmath25 with the degree @xmath13 is proportional to the linear attachment kernel @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the stationary degree distribution @xmath33 of the resulting tree is known to have a power - law tail @xmath12 , where the degree exponent @xmath7 is related to @xmath34 as @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we now consider the bond percolation on the gr tree with @xmath0 nodes .",
    "each bond is open with probability @xmath4 , otherwise closed .",
    "first , we evaluate the fractal exponent @xmath6 of the root cluster .",
    "our calculation here is completely in the same way as for the ising spin system @xcite .",
    "let us assign a level to each node according to the distance @xmath36 from the initial node .",
    "the initial node is regarded as at the @xmath37-th level .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the mean number of nodes at the @xmath36-th level on t@xmath25 .",
    "then the sum of all degrees of the nodes at the @xmath36-th level is equal to @xmath39 . in adding a new node to t@xmath25 ,",
    "the probability that the new node is linked to any node at the @xmath36-th level is @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "if this happens the new node itself is then at the @xmath41-th level , so we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the boundary condition is @xmath45 for all @xmath0 .",
    "the generating function of @xmath38 , @xmath46 is nothing but the mean size of the root cluster , and the recursion relation is obtained from ( [ nnlrec ] ) as @xmath47 it is easily solved as @xmath48for @xmath49 , the second term becomes dominant , so that the mean size of the root cluster grows asymptotically as @xmath50 and thus we find the fractal exponent @xmath6 as @xmath51     of the largest clusters ( blue square ) and @xmath6 of the root cluster ( red circle ) on the gr tree with @xmath52 , from top to bottom .",

    "we consider the time evolution of the number @xmath61 of clusters which have @xmath62 open bonds ( @xmath2 connecting nodes ) and @xmath36 closed bonds at time @xmath63 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath61 is given as @xmath64 with the initial condition @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "assuming the asymptotic form as @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , we obtain @xmath70 summing over @xmath36 gives the cluster size distribution as @xmath71 ; @xmath72 which is evaluated if @xmath73 as @xmath74}n_1 \\propto s^{-\\frac{1+p}{p}},\\ ] ] as previously reported in @xcite . to obtain an estimate of @xmath14 for finite offset @xmath34",
    ", we assume @xmath75 for each @xmath2 to satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "this approximation is the same as of @xcite .",
    "then @xmath14 is obtained as @xmath77}{\\gamma[s+(\\alpha ' -p-1)/(\\alpha ' p+q)+1]}.\\ ] ] thus its asymptotic form for @xmath78 is given by ( [ nspower ] ) with @xmath79 note that the scaling relation ( [ relation ] ) is satisfied between @xmath6 in eq.([psi ] ) and @xmath5 in eq.([tau ] ) .",
    "this result means that @xmath14 on the gr tree always follows power - law type , irrespective of @xmath7 or @xmath4 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we may say the same in terms of the correlation _ volume _ and the correlation _ length_. the connectedness function @xmath81 of node @xmath82 is defined as the probability that a randomly - chosen node , whose distance from node @xmath82 is @xmath36 , belongs to the same cluster with node @xmath82 . assuming that @xmath81 for @xmath83 decays as a single exponential function @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the correlation length .",
    "the correlation volume @xmath86 of node @xmath82 is given by summing the connected function as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of nodes whose distance from node @xmath82 is @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath86 is the size of cluster to which node @xmath82 belongs .",
    "since @xmath88 grows exponentially with @xmath36 for graphs with the small - world property , it is possible that some correlation volumes diverge even when correlation length decays exponentially .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , the critical points @xmath89 and @xmath90 of nags correspond to the points above which the correlation volume and length diverge , respectively .",
    "similarly , these grow with @xmath4 in a different way from each other on the gr trees : eq.([psi ] ) indicates that the correlation volume of the initial node , @xmath91 , diverges if @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , while the correlation length @xmath85 between any node pairs behaves like that of one - dimensional percolations , @xmath94 , and never diverges at any @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "note that in the mpt there is a certain open probability @xmath97 between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , above which the mean cluster size @xmath98 diverges @xcite .",
    "clearly , eq.([tau ] ) with @xmath99 gives the value @xmath100 , so that @xmath97 depends on the degree exponent @xmath7 in contrast to @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "for @xmath101 , @xmath97 reaches @xmath37 in the limit @xmath102 , so the mean cluster size diverges irrespective of @xmath103 .",
    "interestingly , another expression obtained by rewriting it in terms of the moments of @xmath13 , @xmath104 , is also obtained for the percolation threshold on uncorrelated sf networks .",
    "a similar expression for the ising case on the gr tree has already been obtained in @xcite .",

    "we perform the monte - carlo simulations for the bond percolation on the gr trees .",
    "the number of nodes is taken from about 4096 to 65536 . to measure the mean size of the root clusters , we generate 1000 graph samples from the gr tree and simulate the bond percolation 5000 times on each sample .",
    "figure [ psiplot ] plots the fractal exponent of the root cluster @xmath6 and the analytical prediction ( [ psi ] ) . here",

    "we also measure another critical exponent @xmath53 that characterizes the mean size of largest clusters @xmath109 .",
    "the estimated value in fig.[psiplot ] shows a good agreement with @xmath6 , which indicates that the root clusters can be regarded as the largest ones , @xmath110 . to check @xmath14",
    ", we assume a finite size scaling form @xcite ; @xmath111 where the scaling function behaves as @xmath112 here we also assume the scaling relation ( [ relation ] ) .",
    "figure [ fssa0 ] shows our finite size scaling for @xmath14 on the gr tree with @xmath113 .",

    "we also find similar results for various values of @xmath7 as shown in fig.[fssa100 ] .",
    "we consider the scaling relation ( [ relation ] ) is quite general . if @xmath114 holds asymptotically , _ a natural cutoff _",
    "@xmath115 of the cluster size distribution ( a natural cutoff of the degree distribution was introduced in @xcite ) is given as @xmath116 then eq.([relation ] ) follows with replacing @xmath53 by @xmath6 .",
    "finally we note that a standard finite size scaling analysis does not work to determine @xmath89 and @xmath90 by using the data in the critical phase ( see @xcite for the similar argument of the enhanced binary tree ) .",
    "suppose that in the critical phase @xmath117 holds with an increasing analytic function of @xmath118 for @xmath119 . then one can expand @xmath118 around any @xmath120 in the critical phase so that @xmath121 , which leads us to @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a `` scaling function '' around @xmath120 .",
    "this means that the scaled parameter @xmath120 is arbitrary as long as it is in the critical phase and its boundary @xmath89 and @xmath90 is hardly determined from this type of analysis for practical use .",
    "our results indicate that the bond percolation on the gr tree has a critical phase for @xmath80 , and the critical behavior is similar to that observed in a nag @xcite .",
    "the critical phase is characterized by a power - law behavior of @xmath14 with varying exponent .",
    "the same property is observed on the decorated ( 2,2)-flower @xcite and the hanoi networks @xcite . after the submission of this paper , sato and the authors calculated @xmath6 and @xmath5 of the decorated ( 2,2)-flower by a generating functional approach to confirm that the phase is indeed critical everywhere @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the critical phase is caused by opening a gap between the points at which the correlation volume and correlation length start to diverge .",
    "what is the structural factor of networks for such a separation to occur ?",
    "finding the answer is , we believe , an essential step in understanding usual and unusual phase transitions on complex networks .      99 r.albert and a .- l.barabsi _ rev.mod.phys .",
