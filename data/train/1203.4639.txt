    "the many - body electronic states and the pairing mechanism in iron pnictides have been significant open problems . by taking account of the coulomb interaction and the nesting of the fermi surfaces ( fss ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 4](a ) , a fully - gapped sign - reversing @xmath1-wave state ( @xmath3-wave state ) had been proposed @xcite .",
    "experimentally , both @xmath4 and antiferro ( af ) spin correlation increases as @xmath5 decreases in bafe@xmath6(as@xmath7p@xmath8)@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath4 in lafeaso@xmath7f@xmath8 at @xmath9 increases from 23 k to 43 k by applying the pressure , whereas af spin correlation is almost unchanged @xcite .",
    "thus , the relationship between @xmath4 and strength of the spin fluctuation seems to depend on compounds .    on the other hand ,",
    "an orbital - fluctuation - mediated @xmath1-wave state without sign reversal ( @xmath2-wave state ) had been proposed based on the five - orbital hubbard model including the charge quadrupole interaction @xcite .",
    "the charge quadrupole interaction is induced by the vertex correction ( vc)@xcite due to the coulomb interaction and the electron - phonon ( @xmath10-ph ) interaction due to fe - ion einstein oscillations . within the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) , it was found that @xmath11-orbital fluctuation is induced by small @xmath10-ph interaction .",
    "especially , the empirical relationship between @xmath4 and the as - fe - as bond angle ( lee plot ) @xcite has been naturally explained .",
    "recently , theoretically predicated orbital fluctuations @xcite have been detected via the substantial softening of the shear modulus @xcite . the softening of the shear modulus and the structure transition have been explained by the two - orbiton mechanism based on the orbital fluctuation theory@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-wave state is consistent with the robustness of @xmath4 against randomness @xcite as well as the `` resonance - like '' peak structure in the neutron inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "however , spin / orbital fluctuations obtained by the rpa are reduced by the self - energy correction . therefore , in order to confirm the orbital fluctuation scenario , it is desired to analyze the many - body electronic states beyond the rpa . for this purpose ,",
    "the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite would be appropriate , in which the absence of spin / orbital order in 2d systems , known as the mermin - wagner theorem , is rigorously satisfied @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the five - orbital hubbard model including the charge quadrupole interaction for iron pnictides using the flex approximation.@xcite in the normal state , large orbital fluctuations induce highly anisotropic quasiparticle lifetime on the fss as well as the @xmath0-linear or @xmath0-convex resistivity @xmath12 @xcite and the large negative thermo - electric power @xmath13 .",
    "the large orbital fluctuations also introduce the @xmath2-wave superconducting ( sc ) state for a wide range of parameters , and the competition between orbital and spin fluctuations lead to the nodal @xmath1-wave state .",
    "we propose that the orbital fluctuation is the origin of both the @xmath2-wave sc state and the non - fermi - liquid transport phenomena in the normal state .",
    "in this paper , we set the @xmath5 and @xmath14 axes parallel to the nearest fe - fe bonds and the orbital @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 orbitals are denoted as 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .    we employ the five - orbital hubbard model@xcite including the quadrupole - quadrupole [ electron - electron ( el - el ) ] interaction induced by the vc due to the coulomb interaction and @xmath10-ph interaction due to fe - ion einstein optical modes .",

    "[ fig1](a ) , the relation @xmath90 holds for @xmath91 , and the momentum dependence of @xmath92 on each fs is small although the af spin correlation is well developed . the value of @xmath74 increases with @xmath72 , and @xmath93 at @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , @xmath95 for @xmath96 ; the corresponding dimensionless coupling is just @xmath97 .",

    "this `` cold - spot '' is important for the transport phenomena .",
    "since the cold spot is on the e - pocket , the hall coefficient @xmath102 will be negative , consistent with experiments @xcite . in the case of high-@xmath4 cuprates , various non - fermi - liquid transport phenomena ( e.g. ,",

    "[ fig1](b ) , we show how the orbital and spin fluctuations develop as @xmath0 decreases : in the flex , the spin ( orbital ) susceptibility is enhanced by the spin ( orbital ) stoner enhancement factor @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the maximum of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath105 with respect to @xmath106",
    ". then , @xmath107 corresponds to the spin / orbital order , although it is prohibited in 2d systems by the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite . in the case of @xmath83 and @xmath91 , large @xmath108",

    "thus , it is confirmed that both ferro- and af - orbital fluctuations show critical evolutions near the orbital qcp .",

    "<S> we study the five - orbital hubbard model including the charge quadrupole interaction for iron pnictides . using the fluctuation - exchange approximation , </S>",
    "<S> orbital fluctuations evolve inversely proportional to the temperature , and therefore the resistivity shows linear or convex @xmath0-dependence for a wide range of temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the eliashberg gap equation , and show that an @xmath1-wave superconducting state without sign reversal ( @xmath2-wave state ) emerges when the orbital fluctuations dominate over the spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> when both fluctuations are comparable , their competition gives rise to a nodal @xmath1-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> the present study offers us a unified explanation for both the normal and superconducting states . </S>"
