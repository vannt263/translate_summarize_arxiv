    "exclusive production of elementary particles ( lepton pairs , higgs , etc . ) or mesons ( vector mesons , pair of pseudoscalar mesons , etc . ) in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is an interesting and quickly growing field @xcite of theoretical investigation . on experimental side",

    "uncertainties of almost three - orders of magnitude were found . as we discuss here , in the @xmath7 reaction one is sensitive rather to the close - to - threshold region for the @xmath1 subprocess where the specific pqcd approaches of @xcite are not applicable at all .",
    "furthermore the regge - factorization for this hard and soft processes is likely broken",
    ". the @xmath5 pair will eventually decay into the final state of four charged pions .",
    "if the @xmath5 invariant mass is very large , the two @xmath10pairs will be separated by a large rapidity gap .",
    "it has been recently suggested that in this kinematics , charge asymmetries can be used to discover / study the qcd - odderon exchange @xcite .    at the rhic energies discussed here , we will be however dominated by @xmath6 center - of - mass energies in the region of a few gev . here , experimental data for @xmath1 are known and were measured by several groups at @xmath2 colliders @xcite .",
    "experimentally one observes a huge enhancement close to the threshold .",
    "the origin of this enhancement was never understood .",
    "some speculations are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the huge cross section at @xmath11 1.5 - 2 gev was interpreted as a tensor resonance decaying into @xmath5 channel @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the regge factorization was tested . in the following",
