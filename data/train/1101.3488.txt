    "optical afterglow studies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) provide a powerful tool for unveiling the interstellar medium ( ism ) properties of their host galaxies .",
    "long grbs are connected to the death of a massive star , and their host galaxies are subsequently expected to be sites of heavy star - formation extending back to the early universe .",
    "metallicities determined from absorption lines of the ism show higher values than those of , for example , qso absorbers ( fynbo et al . 2006a ; savaglio et al . 2006 ; savaglio 2009 ) , though this might be only a sightline effect ( fynbo et al .",
    "kinematics of absorption lines give some indications for galactic outflows ( e.g. thne et al .",
    "2007 ) , which are an expected phenomenon in star - forming galaxies .",
    "usually , absorption lines in grb afterglow spectra are constant in time . in",
    "a few cases metal absorption lines together with their corresponding fine structure transitions , caused by uv pumping from the intense afterglow radiation , vary in intensity following the change in the ionizing flux of the burst .",
    "modeling of the line variability allows us to better constrain the distance from the grb to the absorbing material , which typically ranges from @xmath3pc to a few kpc ( e.g. vreeswijk et al .",
    "2007 , delia et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the presence of neutral material in the spectra implies distances on the order of a few hundred pc to several kpc ( e.g. prochaska et al .",
    "2007 , thne et al . 2007 ) . for strong",
    "nv absorption lines , it has been suggested that those lines must arise from material close to the grb site , at @xmath4100pc ( prochaska et al .",
    "grb 080310 showed variation in all resonant fe ii transitions which can only be explained with photoionization by the burst at a distance of @xmath5 100pc ( a. de cia et al . in prep . ) .",
    "excluding those few special cases , optical grb afterglow spectroscopy seems to predominantly probe the ism of the host galaxy and not the material around the grb progenitor .    studying the circumburst environment , however , would allow us to verify the predictions of current progenitor models .",
    "prompt emission x  ray data showed some evidence for variations in the absorbing column density ( amati et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the optical , absorption features from circumburst material",
    "are difficult to detect due to the flash ionization of the surrounding material by the grb out to several tens of parsecs ( robinson et al .",
    "2010 ) , even though the grb is predicted to reside in a dense environment .",
    "in addition , any remaining absorbing material would be hidden under the stronger absorption lines from the line - of - sight ism in the host galaxy .",
    "there are several potential signatures which could demonstrate that we are observing material close to the grb instead of the general ism of the galaxy : time variability of the absorption line strength ( perna & loeb 1998 ) , a high ionization state of the medium ( prochaska et al .",
    "2008 ) , or absorption lines at large velocities compared to the redshift of the grb .",
    "the last has been observed in a few cases ( fox et al .",
    "2008 , mller et al .",
    "2002 ) , but it can not be excluded that those systems are intervening absorbers and hence not connected to the grb .",
    "it was also suggested that a large difference between the optical and x - ray column densities might be a hint of observing highly ionized material , eventually close to the grb ( watson et al .",
    "2007 , campana et al . 2010 ) .",
    "an ideal laboratory would be a grb progenitor that exploded in a relatively isolated environment with little ism along the line of sight .",
    "so far , no conclusive evidence for such conditions has been found , probably because such physical conditions are rare and only a few afterglows have time resolved afterglow spectroscopy . in this paper",
    "we present the first example for such a scenario , grb 090426 .",
    "grb 090426 was discovered by the bat ( burst alert telescope ) @xmath6-ray telescope onboard the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) on april 26 , 2009 , 12:48 ut ( cummings et al . 2009 ) and had a duration of @xmath7s ( sato et al .",
    "soon after its discovery an optical counterpart was found by _ swift _",
    "( cummings et al . 2009 ) and the redshift was determined from an optical spectrum to be @xmath8 ( levesque et al .",
    "both its restframe duration ( 0.3s ) as well as its observed duration put grb 090426 into the short burst category according to the commonly used classification based on the duration of the prompt emission .    in  2",
    "we describe the optical spectra and afterglow observations . in ",
    "3 we discuss the characteristics of grb 090426 itself and some issues regarding its classification .  4 describes the properties of the ism in the line of sight as derived from optical and x  ray observations . in ",
    "5 we deal in detail with the ly@xmath1 line variation and model its behaviour with a photoionisation code .",
    " 6 describes the properties of the host galaxy of grb 090426 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are reported in  7 .",
    "we obtained both photometric and spectroscopic observations of the afterglow and the host galaxy .",
    "the imaging data are listed in tab .",
    "[ logafterglow ] , and the spectroscopic observations are detailed in tab .",
    "we observed the optical afterglow with mosca and alfosc at the not as well as fors2 at the vlt from 2009 apr .",
    "26 to june 19 in several bands .",
    "in addition , we include acquisition images from the spectroscopic observations .",
    "photometry was performed using sdss stars ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) as reference and the transformations described by jester et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to convert the sdss to v and r@xmath9 magnitudes . in order to account for the contribution of the host galaxy system to the light curve independent of the seeing , we used aperture photometry centered on the afterglow with radius of 2  .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of the afterglow with fors2 at the vlt starting on 2009 apr 27.048 ut ( 12.3 hr after the burst ) using grisms 600v and 600ri together with a 10 slit and an exposure time of 30min per grism .",
    "the spectrum covers a wavelength range from 3500 to 8600 with a resolution of @xmath5 11  .",
    "furthermore , we reanalyzed the spectrum from levesque et al . (",
    "2010 ) taken with lris at keck 1.1 hr after the burst .",
    "this spectrum has a similar resolution and wavelength coverage compared to the fors2 spectrum .",
    "* the spectra were reduced using standard tasks in iraf , with the different exposures and grisms from each instrument combined , flux calibrated , and then normalized .",
    "flux calibration prior to normalizing the spectrum makes the normalization more reliable , especially bluewards of ly @xmath1 and in the ly @xmath1 forest , since the afterglow continuum follows a smooth power law . *    after the fading of the afterglow an object was found @xmath10 sw of the grb position and initially suggested as the candidate host galaxy ( g1 ) .",
    "we took spectra of g1 with fors2 at the vlt on june 18 2009 using grism 300v ( 3300  8700  ) and exposure times of 2@xmath11s .",
    "the acquisition image for the spectroscopic observations of g1 revealed another object underlying the grb position ( therefore suggested as the real host galaxy , h ) , for which we obtained another spectrum on june 19 2009 with the same settings and exposure times .",
    "we also obtained 2 @xmath12 30min spectra with x - shooter at the vlt ( dodorico et al .",
    "2006 ) on june 2 2009 , covering a wavelength range from 9800 to 24800  .",
    "the slit was placed across the grb position ( and the host ) and g1 .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the variability of ly@xmath1 strongly suggests that the material lies close to the grb progenitor .",
    "such an effect has been predicted from photoionization modeling ( perna & loeb 1998 ) , but has never before been observed .",
    "the high column densities of the high ionization lines and the absence of their low ionization counterparts support the scenario that we are observing a large quantity of matter close to and ionised by the grb .",
    "this is further supported by the large difference between the optical and x  ray column density , which can be explained by photoionization of the medium by the grb ; x  ray absorption is insensitive to this phenomenon since it is caused by excitation of the electrons in the inner shells of the atoms ( campana et al .",

    "the following lines , which are usually strong in the environments of long - duration grbs , are not detected in our spectrum : siii @xmath17 1260,1304 and 1526  , c ii @xmath171534 , and al iii @xmath17 1670,1855 and 1863 .",
    "the ews of c iv and si iv in the spectrum of grb 090426 are almost twice as high as in the composite grb spectrum .",
    "considering that the hi column density of grb 090426 is very low compared to the approximate value for the composite ( log @xmath18/@xmath14= 21.7 ) , the relative abundance of these species are rather extreme for this burst .    if we take only a composite of sub - dla bursts ( 3 spectra ) , we see the following : a fit of the ly@xmath1 absorption line gives log @xmath18/@xmath14=19.3@xmath190.1 ( dominated by the spectrum of grb 070411 ) .",

    "2009 ( see fig . [ 090426:comp ] ) , grb 090426 occupies a rather different region than most burst in the sample .",
    "however , it seems that other grbs with low n@xmath13 also tend to show a rather high ionisation state of the observed medium .",
    "grb 060607a is the most extreme case , although it is not included in the plot since only civ has been listed in fynbo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . from fig . 3 in fox",
    "et al . ( 2008 ) , who analysed the uves spectrum of this burst , we see that this burst , together with the lowest reported log n@xmath13/@xmath14 of 16.8 ( fox et al .",
    "2008 , whereas fynbo et al .",
    "2009 report a value of @xmath5 17.2 ) for a grb , has no cii or siii while the high ionisation species are rather strong .",
    "grb 050809 has relatively strong low ionisation lines , but the value in fig .",
    "[ 090426:comp ] is influenced by the nondetection of siiv @xmath17 1403 while the other line of the doublet at @xmath17 1393 is detected .",
    "this seems to confirm that there is a correlation between the hydrogen column density and the ionisation of the medium , not surprising since a large hydrogen column density would screen the uv radiation from the grb .",
    "however , it might also imply that some bursts occur in a rather isolated region of their host galaxy , which would allow us to truly probe ionised gas from the surroundings of the burst itself .    /@xmath14",

    "photoionization models allow to us determine the distance of the observed material from the grb by considering the ionization state , column densities , and their variations with time ( e.g. lazzati et al . 2001 ) . here",
    ", we use the photoionisation code by perna & lazzati ( 2002 , see also lazzati & perna 2003 ) specifically written for application to grb observations .",
    "the code assumes that the grb is initially surrounded by a cold ( @xmath21  k ) absorbing material with solar metallicity , either in the form of a spherical shell * with a thickness of 0.1 the shell radius * or a spherical cloud . the grb spectrum and its temporal evolution are the input in the code , which computes the evolution of the absorbing material s ionization state as a function of both time and the distance of the absorber from the burst .",
    "at each time , the resulting wavelength - dependent opacity integrated over the line - of - sight is outputted and compared to the observations .",
    "the total absorption at early times is a measure of the total absorbing column , while the speed of the evolution is a measure of the distance of the absorber .",
    "this analysis is similar to what has been done for the combined soft - x - ray photoionization opacity in grb  050904 ( campana et al .",
    "grb  090426 is better suited for this kind of analysis since we observe variation in the hi absorption .",
    "since hydrogen is the most abundant element in the ism , constraining the geometry of the absorption region with the evolution of the ly@xmath1 absorption gives us a direct result that does not depend on metallicity considerations .",
    "the four panels of figure  [ fig : ew ] show the measured column densities of the h , c , si , and n ions with the best absorption model overlaid .",
    "we obtain the best fit model for a uniform cloud surrounding the grb .",
    "the cloud properties are fit using only the hi absorption , with the other ions and the soft - x - ray continuum absorption only used as consistency checks .",
    "the absorber that best reproduces our ly@xmath1 measurements is a cloud of radius @xmath22  pc ( which corresponds to the size of a large molecular cloud ) and an initial hi column density @xmath23  @xmath14 .",
    "such values correspond to a total mass of the molecular cloud of @xmath24 and an average density @xmath25  @xmath26 .",
    "the errors on the values from the modeling are on the order of @xmath27 .",
    "* the model does not rule out a solution in the form of a shell ; however , since the thickness of the shell is 0.1r , the density would be about 10 times larger as a result .",
    "a wind blown medium would be fully ionised ( see robinson et al .",
    "2010 ) at very early times and is therefore ruled out here . *",
    "figure  [ fig : clev ] shows the 1- , 2- , and 3- @xmath28 contour levels of the ly@xmath1 fitting in the @xmath29 plane ( thin solid lines ) .",
    "overlaid is the area that is consistent with the combined constraint of siiv column evolution and soft x - ray continuum absorption .",
    "the siiv constraint allows for regions of high column density ( right of the thick solid line ) while the soft x - ray absorption allows only for low column density regions ( left of the dashed line ) .",
    "the shaded area is in full agreement with the ly@xmath1 result .",
    "a much looser constraint comes from the nv fitting , while the civ column density can not be fit by our model . the civ excess might be an indication of a carbon - enriched medium , possibly from earlier sn explosions , but we caution the reader due to the large errors affecting the civ line ( see sec .",

    "the agreement of the photoionization model predictions with the evolution of the column densities ultimately confirms that all the material we observe is close to the grb site .",
    "such material has never been probed before in grb afterglow spectra .",
    "in addition to the afterglow spectroscopy , we obtained observations of the host galaxy and its neighbour . using the acquisition images of the spectroscopic observations , we determined the magnitudes of the two galaxies g1 and h ( the host ) to be @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , corresponding to absolute magnitudes of @xmath32(1500)= 21.05 and 20.43 . at the host redshift",

    "both galaxies show clear ly@xmath1 emission at redshifts of @xmath34 ( h ) and @xmath35 ( g1 ) , indicating that the host has about the same redshift as the grb while the companion is at a slightly higher redshift . at that redshift ,",
    "the physical distance between their cores is only 9kpc in projection , which implies that they are likely interacting and possibly in the process of merging .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission of the host galaxy gives a star formation rate of 3.1 @xmath36 yr@xmath37 , on the lower end of what is typically observed in ( long duration ) grb hosts ( savaglio et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in the 2-dimensional x - shooter spectrum",
    "we detect several faint emission lines in the near - ir , including [ oiii ] @xmath17 5007 , 4959 and h@xmath38 .",
    "both [ oiii ] lines show two components separated by about 400 km s@xmath37 and offset in the spatial direction , which we attribute to the host ( h ) and g1 .",
    "the second component of h@xmath38 is coincident with an atmospheric emission line .    comparing the afterglow spectra and the emission lines from the hot gas of the two galaxies , the kinematics turn out to be rather complex ( see fig . [ 090426:kinematics ] ) .",
    "the siiv transitions at @xmath17 1393 and 1403  each show two equally strong velocity components with a separation of about 300 kms@xmath37 . for nv and civ ,",
    "the two components can not be separated since the doublets are closer together ( civ is also affected by a sky line ) .",
    "the red component of the siiv lines is at about the same velocity as the center of the ly@xmath1 absorption .",
    "the almost equally strong blue si iv component is coincident with the blue wing of ly@xmath1 , which could be fitted with a small additional component at that velocity but with only 1/100 to 1/1000 the column density of the main component .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission lines of the host and g1 are slightly redshifted compared to their nebular emission lines , which could imply an outflow of hydrogen gas as commonly observed in , for example , lyman break galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "furthermore , emission and absorption line velocities from the host do not coincide , which suggests a complex velocity field due to the physical motion of the material seen in absorption .",
    "this is to be expected in the merging process of two galaxies .",
    "it also supports the suggestion that the material we see in absorption is actually close to the grb and not only coming from the ism of the host galaxy .",
    "the spectrum of grb 090426 is the first compelling case of observed photoionised material from the star - forming region of the progenitor itself .",
    "its low hydrogen column density is varying , the absorption lines show a highly ionised medium of high column density , and the large discrepancy between x  ray and optical absorption gives another indication for photoionised material being present .",
    "grb spectra have shown a large range of hydrogen column densities , usually explained by different sightlines of the grb through its host galaxy ( fynbo et al .",
    "2009 ; jakobsson et al .",
    "2006 ) , with some column densities even lower than the one measured for grb 090426 .",
    "however , if grb 090426 exploded in , for example , the halo of the galaxy or a very low density ism like a globular cluster , we would also expect low column densities of the metal absorption lines .",
    "a location in the halo had been suggested for grb 070125 ( cenko et al .",
    "2008 ) and grb 071003 ( perley et al .",
    "2008 ) , both of which show a bright but featureless continuum with extremely weak absorption lines .",
    "grbs with log @xmath18/@xmath14 @xmath4 20.0 tend to show a higher fraction of ionised versus neutral material , possibly explained by a lack of uv shielding by the lower density of hydrogen ; however , some of them still contain a relatively large column density of neutral material .",
    "in addition , the afterglow showed that the grb must have exploded in a non - low - density medium ( levesque et al .",
    "the strange properties of the spectrum of grb 090426 can therefore not simply be explained by a sightline effect .",
    "considering the fact that this grb exploded in what seems to be a galaxy merger , another scenario might explain the strange spectrum we observe .",
    "the lack of absorption from the normal ism of the host suggests that the progenitor did not reside in a star - forming region inside its host galaxy .",
    "a possible scenario is therefore that the progenitor was located in an isolated star - forming region outside the host itself , e.g. in something like a tidal tail created by the merging of the two galaxies .",
    "thus , the sightline to the grb would only intersect the material of the star - forming region , ionised by the grb flux and eventually piled up by the wind from massive wolf - rayet stars , and not the dense ism of the galaxy .",
    "we note , however , that the afterglow position is , in projection , close to the center of the galaxy .",
    "another strange feature about this burst was its relatively short duration paired with a soft high energy emission spectrum .",
    "naturally , the question arises if the unusual high - energy properties and those of the afterglow spectrum could be connected . from fig .",
    "[ 090426:hr ] we see that all other low column density grbs occupy the normal parameter space for long bursts concerning hr and duration , so there seems to be no obvious correlation between hr or duration and low column density .",
    "since the material observed in the afterglow spectrum is relatively far away from the burst compared to the prompt emission , which is expected to be produced by internal shocks within the jet of the grb , a connection is not to be expected .    concerning the progenitor of the burst , antonelli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and levesque et al .",
    "( 2010 ) had already concluded that , despite its short duration , the burst was likely due to the collapse of a massive star .",
    "arguments include the star - forming host galaxy , the high afterglow luminosity , consistency with the amati relation , and the strength of the absorption lines . in past years",
    ", the classification of bursts purely on its duration or another single observational fact has also been questioned .",
    "evidence for a collapsar progenitor has been observed even in the absence of a supernova signature ( grb 060505 and grb 060614 , see e.g. fynbo et al .",
    "2006b ) , which we can not verify for grb 090426 since the sn would be too faint to detect with current instruments , and a range of high redshift bursts have been detected with short intrinsic duration ( see e.g. l et al . 2010 ) .",
    "suggestions for how to produce a collapsar with such a short intrinsic duration include viewing the grb from off - axis , such that we see only a small part of the jet ( lazzati et al .",
    "2009 ) , or the possibility that the central engine had been turned off before the jet reached the surface of the str , with the destruction wave catching up with the jet and leading to a shorter prompt duration ( mizuta & aloy 2009 ) .",
    "no other grb observed so far has shown such extreme properties of the absorption lines , despite a number of spectra with relatively low column densities . however",
    ", none of them had time resolved spectral observations that would allow a line variability study ( with the exception of grb 080310 , a potentially similar case to grb 090426 concerning the properties of the afterglow spectrum ; see a. de cia et al . in prep . ) .",
    "a larger number of rapid response observations and time series of spectra using a high sensitivity and medium- to high - resolution spectrographs ( in order to fit reliable column densities ) might allow us to study a few more of those rare events where we directly see the interaction of the grb with its environment .",
