    "they also exhibit energetic regions with a _ negative specific heat _ , which persist even in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "that is the reason why the gibbs canonical ensemble is non applicable to the description of selfgravitating systems , since this ensemble is not able to access to those macroscopic states possesing a negative heat capacity . at first glance ,",
    "the selfgravitating systems could only be described by using the microcanonical ensemble .",

    "there are some approaches which have taken into account this kind of regularization of the long - range singularity of the newtonian potential in a microcanonical framework @xcite .",
    "the use of the rigid container can be conveniently substituted by imposing the following energetic prescription : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the kinetic energy of a particle of mass @xmath2 and @xmath3 its gravitational potential energy at the point @xmath4 , being @xmath5 an energy cutoff which is determined from the existence of certain tidal forces .",
    "all those particles satisfying the condition ( [ renormalization ] ) are confined by the gravity , on contrary , they will be able to scape out from the system if they do not lose their excessive energy .",
    "this regularization procedure is characteristic of the michie - king model for globular clusters @xcite , which supposes that those stars that gain suficient velocity through encounters are able to escape or are removed by tidal forces .",
    "the main motivation of such regularization scheme relies on the consideration of evaporation effects , and therefore , this regularization procedure is more realistic than the box regularization ( the use of the rigid container ) .",
