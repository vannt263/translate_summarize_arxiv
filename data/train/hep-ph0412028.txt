    "because of its large mass close to the electroweak scale , the top quark plays a special role in many new physics models . therefore , determining the couplings of the top quark is an important goal of future collider experiments in order to distinguish the minimal standard model from one of its extensions  @xcite .",
    "the ckm matrix element @xmath1 is presently constrained indirectly assuming unitarity of the ckm matrix and the expected precision of a direct measurement at the lhc is @xmath2 . at an international linear collider  ( ilc )  @xcite , a comparable precision can be achieved in single top production @xmath3  @xcite while a significant improvement requires the @xmath4 option of a linear collider  @xcite .",
    "an indirect determination is possible from the top width measurement at the top - pair production threshold at ilc  @xcite .",
    "assuming a higgs boson is found at lhc , measuring its yukawa coupling to the top quark  that is predicted to be equal to @xmath5 in the standard model on tree level  will be important to establish its properties and identify the underlying mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . at lhc",
    ", the top quark yukawa coupling can be determined to a precision of @xmath6 if the branching ratios of a standard model higgs boson are assumed or if the branching ratios are measured at an ilc operating at @xmath7 gev  @xcite . at an ilc with @xmath8 gev , in associated top higgs production",
    "@xcite @xmath9 a precision of @xmath10 can be reached in the determination of the top quark yukawa coupling  @xcite , depending on the value of the higgs mass .",
    "again , an indirect measurement of @xmath11 is possible at the top - pair production threshold  @xcite .    in this note ,",
    "i describe the calculation of tree level electroweak cross sections for six and eight fermion final states , contributing to single top production and associated top - higgs production , respectively .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the matrix element generator ` omega `  @xcite and the adaptive monte carlo phase space and event generator ` whizard `  @xcite .",
    "results for qcd backgrounds to associated top - higgs production obtained with ` madgraph `  @xcite are also presented .",
    "it is pointed out that a consistent treatment of finite width effects is essential in obtaining numerically reliable predictions .",
    "similarly , violating gauge invariance by including only subsets of feynman diagrams can give wrong results in important regions of phase space .    in section  [ sec : omega ] ,",
    "i give a brief update on ` omega ` and ` whizard ` , including a description of schemes implemented for the treatment of unstable particles .",
    "single top production and the relevant backgrounds from top - pair production and vector boson fusion are discussed in section  [ sec : single - top ] .",
    "associated top higgs production , backgrounds from associated top-@xmath12 production and gluon splitting and the numerical effects of including the full eight fermion final state are discussed in section  [ sec : yukawa ] .",
    "theoretical predictions for the physical six particle final states for single top production require the calculation of cross sections with hundreds to thousands contributing diagrams . for this purpose",
    "various computer programs are available and good agreement among the different codes has been found  @xcite . in associated top higgs production ,",
    "eight fermion final states with over twenty thousand diagrams appear for the decay mode @xmath13 .",
    "first results for such processes obtained with ` helac / phegas `  @xcite and ` omega / whizard ` have been presented  @xcite but a comprehensive study remains to be performed .",
    "here , i briefly review the current status of the programs ` omega / whizard ` used in the calculations described in this note .    in the `",
    "omega ` algorithm  @xcite , the amplitude is expressed in terms of sub - amplitudes with one external off - shell particle that can be constructed recursively . in this construction ,",
    "feynman diagrams are not generated separately and sub - amplitudes appearing more than once in the amplitude are factorized by construction , avoiding redundant code .",
    "the one - particle off shell sub - amplitudes satisfy simple ward identities , allowing for comprehensive gauge checks  @xcite that have be used to verify the implementation of the feynman rules of the electroweak standard model . `",
    "omega ` allows to generate ` fortran ` code for helicity amplitudes with arbitrary external particles , where masses are treated exactly .",
    "the complete electroweak standard model in unitarity and @xmath14 gauge is available , including ckm mixing .",
    "in addition , majorana fermions are supported  @xcite and the complete minimal supersymmetric standard model has been implemented . while qcd interaction vertices are included ,",
    "the implementation of interfering color amplitudes is not yet completed .",
    "thus qcd effects can presently only be included in simple situations where an overall color factor is sufficient .",
    "recent versions of ` omega ` allow to treat cascade decays of unstable particles , either by using the narrow width approximation or by selecting the diagrams with decay topology but keeping the decaying particle off - shell .",
    "for the phase space integration and event generation the adaptive multi - channel monte carlo package ` whizard `  @xcite has been used . in the current version",
    "the treatment of multi - particle final states with identical particles has been improved and good numerical agreement has been found  @xcite between the multi purpose programs ` omega / whizard ` and the dedicated six fermion production program ` lusifer `  @xcite . for processes with few identical particles in the final state , `",
    "omega / whizard ` has been found to be more efficient  @xcite , for processes with many identical particles the dedicated program . for up to six particles in the final state also matrix elements generated with ` madgraph ` can be used in ` whizard ` where the version currently implemented allows to include qcd effects at a fixed order of the coupling constant .    to obtain correct and numerically stable predictions for cross sections , it is important to use a consistent scheme for the decay widths of unstable particles .",
    "several schemes have been implemented in ` omega ` and compared in single @xmath15-production  @xcite . here",
    "i briefly discuss schemes for the top quark propagator  @xcite , similar remarks apply to the treatment of the gauge boson widths .",
    "a numerical comparison is given in  section  [ sec : single - top ] . while it is physically sensible to include a finite width only in resonant propagators , the resulting _ step width _",
    "scheme is in general inconsistent with gauge invariance . in the _ fixed width scheme _ , in ` omega ` the prescription @xmath16",
    "is used that is consistent with qed gauge invariance , in contrast to a naive breit wigner propagator , i.e. @xmath17 . while the fixed width scheme does not respect @xmath18 invariance , in the examples considered previously ( e.g. in  @xcite ) no numerical inconsistencies have been found . however , for forward scattering of the electron in the process @xmath19 considered in section  [ sec : single - top ] the fixed width scheme becomes numerically unstable in feynman gauge . in the _ complex mass _ scheme  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath18 gauge invariance is restored by replacing @xmath20 not only in the propagator but everywhere in the lagrangian , i.e. also in the top - yukawa couplings to the higgs and goldstone bosons .",
    "similar replacements are performed for the gauge boson masses , leading e.g. to a complex weinberg angle .",
    "the complex mass scheme is consistent for scattering amplitudes where only stable particles appear as external states , so the application in the single top production process @xmath21 requires to consider complete six fermion final states .",
    "another fully gauge invariant scheme is the _ fudge factor _ or overall scheme , where the amplitude is calculated with vanishing widths and multiplied with an overall factor @xmath22 for each resonant propagator .",
    "the triple gauge boson vertices in the nonlocal effective lagrangian scheme of  @xcite are also available in ` omega ` .",
    "a problematic high energy behavior has been found in simple versions of this scheme both in the second reference of  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "while the implementation of the @xmath23 vertex in this scheme into ` omega ` is planned for the future , it has not been used in the calculations described in this note .",
    "in this section , i discuss cross sections for six fermion final states contributing to single top production at a linear collider .",
    "an analysis of the measurement of the ckm matrix element using the process @xmath24 has been given in  @xcite and extended to anomalous couplings and the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 options of a linear collider in  @xcite .",
    "no six fermion final states have been considered , however .",
    "results for the reactions @xmath28 have appeared also in  @xcite .",
    "existing studies of six fermion final states for top production  @xcite have focused on top pair production and found background contributions of @xmath29 for @xmath30 gev , becoming more important with growing center of mass energy . also distortions in angular and invariant mass distributions by irreducible backgrounds have been observed .",
    "the impact of an anomalous @xmath31 coupling on the angular distributions of the leptonic decay products of the top quarks in six fermion final states for top pair production has been found to be small  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained with ` omega / whizard ` have been compared with existing results given in the literature .",
    "for the top production process @xmath21 agreement has been found with the results of  @xcite within the errors of the monte carlo integration . in table",
    "[ tab:6f - amegic ] , for some six fermion final states @xmath32 we compare with the results of  @xcite obtained with ` amegic `  @xcite , adopting the same set of input parameters and cuts and treating all fermions as massive . for comparison ,",
    "the results of  @xcite for massless fermions are also shown .",
    ".comparison of cross sections for six fermion final states contributing to single top production for @xmath33 gev [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , table  [ tab:8f ] shows the results for the full electroweak contributions to the leptonic final state @xmath34 and the semileptonic final state @xmath35 .",
    "similar to the process with an on - shell higgs in table  [ tab : yukawatop7 ] , going from the subset of diagrams with an intermediate top pair to that with an intermediate @xmath15 pair amounts to an effect of @xmath36 for @xmath37 gev , growing to @xmath38 at @xmath39 tev . the inclusion of the full set of diagrams contributing to the eight fermion final state shows no significant effect for the final states without identical particles considered here .",
    "in this note , i have described results obtained with the computer programs ` omega ` and ` whizard ` for six and eight fermion final states relevant for the measurement of the @xmath1 ckm matrix element and the higgs - top yukawa coupling at a linear collider .    in single top production , as discussed in section  [ sec : single - top ] , after applying cuts on the invariant mass of the @xmath40 pair to reduce vector boson fusion backgrounds , a difference between the top - production contribution and the full cross section of the order of @xmath41 remains .",
    "a small forward scattering angle of the electron enhances the single top signal at high energies , but also the vector boson fusion background . for this forward scattering of the electron , gauge invariant and numerically stable results",
    "have only been obtained in the fudge factor and the complex mass schemes for unstable particles .",
    "a study of anomalous couplings has been left for future work .    in the associated top - higgs production process discussed in section  [ sec : yukawa ] , an effect of the order of @xmath42 has been found in the electroweak cross section in going from the subset of diagrams with an intermediate top pair to that with an intermediate @xmath43 state .",
    "for the qcd background , the effect is much larger , as observed already in  @xcite .",
    "the numerical effect of including the full set of diagrams for the 8 fermion final states has turned out to be small if no identical fermions are present in the final state .",
    "future studies will include a variation of the values of the top and higgs masses and the inclusion of anomalous higgs - top couplings . for heavier higgs bosons the decay modes @xmath44 fermions",
    "should also be considered .",
