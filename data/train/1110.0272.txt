    "@xcite , the fractal property of complex networks has been extensively studied recently @xcite .",
    "the fractal property of a network is measured by the box - covering method in which the minimum number of subgraphs ( boxes ) of diameter @xmath2 ( in the sense of network distance ) required to cover the fractal network is proportional to @xmath3 with the fractal dimension @xmath4 .",
    "most of real - world fractal networks are inhomogeneous in the sense of the scale - free property defined by a power - law degree distribution @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of connections of a node ( degree ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the number of nodes in a subgraph of size @xmath2 depends strongly on whether the subgraph includes hubs and their neighboring nodes or not , which implies that the distribution of local node density is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "an inhomogeneous distribution of a physical quantity on a fractal object often exhibits the multifractal property @xcite . in many of fractal objects embedded in euclidean space",
    ", however , the underlying structure seldom shows the multifractal nature because of an exponentially thin tail of the mass distribution . on the contrary",
    ", we expect the multifractal scaling in a scale - free network due to large fluctuations of local node density . in this paper",
    ", we show analytically and numerically that fractal scale - free networks ( fsfns ) can have the multifractal property in their structural features .",
    "in order to explicate the possibility that a fsfn takes a multifractal structure , let us consider , at first , why conventional fractal structures do not possess the multifractal property . in the multifractal analysis , the behavior of a coarse - grained physical quantity on a fractal object is argued .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be a physical quantity on the discretized position @xmath9 and its normalized value ( measure ) , this is , @xmath10 the coarse - grained measure ( box measure ) @xmath11 is then given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a box of size @xmath2 in the system .",
    "if the spatial distribution of the physical quantity @xmath14 does not bring a characteristic length scale , the @xmath1th moment of the box measure @xmath15 has a power - law @xmath2 dependence , namely , @xmath16 , where the summation in eq .",
    "( [ box_measure ] ) is taken over boxes of size @xmath2 required to cover minimally the entire system . in the case that the exponent @xmath0 ( called as the mass exponent ) is a nonlinear ( linear ) function of @xmath1 , the distribution of the measure is regarded to be multifractal ( unifractal ) . here , we consider a constant mass of the site @xmath9 as a physical quantity @xmath17 .",
    "the normalized measure @xmath8 representing the mass density becomes constant and the box measure @xmath18 averaged over boxes is proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath4 is the fractal dimension of the system .",
    "if the fluctuation of @xmath11 over boxes is sufficiently small , eq .  ( [ box_measure ] ) is approximated as @xmath20 therefore we have the linear relation @xmath21 representing the unifractal nature of the mass density distribution .",
    "in fact , a narrow distribution of the box measure is widely observed in many fractals embedded in euclidean space @xcite .",
    "thus , most of fractal systems take unifractal structures , with some exceptions such as mathematical multifractal sets as the two - scale cantor set @xcite and geochemical distribution of minerals @xcite .",
    "the box measure @xmath11 of node density in a fsfn , however , has large fluctuations over boxes @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath11 of a box including a hub node can be much larger than that of a box without hubs .",
    "if the probability distribution function of the box measure has a fat tail like a power - law or log - normal form , @xmath11 can not be approximated by @xmath22 and the failure of eq .",
    "( [ similar ] ) gives a possibility of the multifractal scaling in structures of complex networks .    when applying the multifractal analysis to complex networks , it is unavoidable that covering boxes ( subgraphs ) of network diameter @xmath2 overlap each other @xcite , if every box includes the maximum number of nodes unless the subgraph diameter does not exceed @xmath2 as in the conventional multifractal analysis @xcite . therefore , the measure @xmath8 defined by eq .",
    "( [ measure1 ] ) can not be normalized as @xmath23 , and the mass exponent does not satisfy the basic condition @xmath24 . in order to overcome",
    "this difficulty , we modify the definition of the measure as @xmath25 in this definition , the normalization constant , and then @xmath8 , varies with the box size @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to confirm that the mass exponent calculated from eq .",
    "( [ mu_cn ] ) satisfies the general conditions @xmath26 and @xmath24 and for a unifractal system @xmath21 .",
    "we set hereafter @xmath27 to analyze the multifractal nature of the node density in a complex network .",
    "flower with @xmath28 in the third generation .",
    "( a ) the network is covered by @xmath29 @xmath30 flowers in the first generation ( scheme i ) , and ( b ) the network is first covered by four subgraphs of size @xmath31 centered at the largest hubs ( white nodes ) then covered by eight subgraphs centered at the second largest hubs ( gray nodes ) ( scheme ii).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "using the above definition of @xmath8 , we first examine analytically the multifractal property of the @xmath30-flower model @xcite .",
    "this deterministic model provides a class of fsfns . in this model , we start with the cycle graph consisting of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) nodes and edges ( the first generation ) . the network in the @xmath34th generation",
    "is obtained by replacing each edge in the @xmath35th generation network by two parallel paths of @xmath36 and @xmath37 edges .",
    "the network with large @xmath34 has the scale - free property with the degree exponent @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the number of nodes in the @xmath34th generation network is given by @xmath39 and the number of edges is @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , when @xmath41 is even , the diameter is written as @xmath42 from the network formation algorithm , the @xmath34th generation network is constructed by @xmath43 of @xmath30 flowers in the @xmath44th generation , where @xmath45 .",
    "this implies that if we cover the @xmath34th generation network by the @xmath44th generation subgraphs as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) the number of covering boxes @xmath46 is @xmath43 . using eq .",
    "( [ diameter ] ) , we can rewrite this relation as @xmath47^{-\\log w/\\log u}$ ] , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "if the length @xmath50 is large enough , we have the fractal dimension given by @xmath51 @xcite . the above covering scheme ( named as the covering scheme i ) , however , does not lead the minimum value of @xmath46 for a fixed @xmath50 . let us consider the following covering scheme ( named as the covering scheme ii ) . at first",
    ", we cover the @xmath30 flower by subgraphs of size @xmath50 centered at the largest hubs , then the remaining network is covered by subgraphs centered at the second largest hubs . repeating this procedure until all nodes are covered by subgraphs [ as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ] the number of covering boxes @xmath46 becomes less than @xmath43 .",
    "although two covering schemes yield different @xmath46 , these are in proportion as shown later , and then the fractal dimension calculated by the covering scheme ii is the same as that by scheme i. therefore , both covering schemes are valid for the _ fractal _ analysis . in the _ multifractal _ analysis , however , we treat not only @xmath52 but also @xmath53 for any @xmath1 . since the moment @xmath53 calculated by the covering scheme",
    "i is generally not proportional to @xmath54 by scheme ii , we need to choose scheme ii with less ( probably minimum ) covering boxes for the multifractal analysis of the @xmath30 flower .",
    "it is , in general , quite important to cover a network by less number of boxes in the multifractal analysis comparing to the case of the fractal analysis .",
    "let us cover the @xmath30 flower in the @xmath34th generation by boxes of size @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) in the covering scheme ii .",
    "the number of boxes @xmath57 centered at the @xmath58th largest hubs is equal to the number of such hubs , thus we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents a box of size @xmath50 centered at the @xmath58th largest hub and @xmath61 .",
    "since the number of nodes @xmath62 in @xmath60 is presented by @xmath63 the total number of nodes in all boxes , namely , the denominator of eq .",
