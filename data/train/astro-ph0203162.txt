    "the ongoing search for nearby stars is a challenge because the vast majority of stellar objects in the galaxy consist of intrinsically faint m dwarf stars , whose absolute visual magnitudes are in the @xmath3 range . not only are there several stellar systems waiting to be discovered , but it is very likely that a significant number of known nearby systems are yet to be recognized as multiple stars .",
    "a census of the stars in the immediate vicinity ( @xmath4pc ) of the sun reveals that more than half of the stellar bodies are members of double and triple stellar systems ( van de kamp 1971 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ third catalog of nearby stars _ by gliese & jahreiss 1991 ( hereafter gj ) , lists only 1031 bodies in multiple systems out of a total of 3803 stars .",
    "multiplicity among nearby m dwarf stars has been discussed and estimated by fischer & marcy ( 1992 ) .",
    "methods for the identification of companions depend on the separation ( semi - major axis @xmath5 ) between the components . for stars in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "very close companions @xmath6 au can generally be identified as spectroscopic binaries .",
    "systems with intermediate separations ( 1 au@xmath725 au ) are best found with high - resolution imaging techniques .",
    "nearby wide binaries , on the other hand , are well resolved on the sky , even on old photographic plates , and the challenge is to distinguish them from background stars .",
    "the main method to identify the components of nearby wide binaries is through their common proper motion .",
    "while close and intermediate separation binaries require intensive observational efforts , wide binaries can be identified using available all - sky surveys , provided they are sensitive enough to detect the companion as a high proper motion object .",
    "a list of wide binaries has been compiled by poveda _",
    "_ 1994 ( hereafter phacl ) . expanding on the gj catalog",
    ", they searched for unaccounted common proper motion companions to gj stars within 22.5pc of the sun by correlating the gj stars with entries in the _ catalog of double stars with common proper motion _ ( lds catalog , luyten 1987 ) and in the _ new luyten catalogue of stars with proper motions larger than two tenths of an arcsecond _",
    "( nltt catalog , luyten 1980 ) .",
    "they found 18 more systems overlooked by gj .",
    "the compilation given in phacl includes 305 wide binaries , 26 triples , and 3 quadruples , all systems with a semi - major axis @xmath8au , i.e. with an angular separation exceeding 1@xmath9 . the fact that phacl reports 18 companions not listed in gj strongly suggest that there are many more companions to be found , because _ both the nltt and lds catalogs are themselves significantly incomplete_.    two recent studies have provided a striking demonstration of the effect of incompleteness of high proper motion star catalogs on the current census of wide binary systems .",
    "mccarthy , zuckerman , & becklin ( 2001 ) have discovered one previously unrecognized , faint common proper motion companion to the star g144 - 016 ( gj 4153 ) .",
    "they serendipitously found the faint common proper motion companion ( located 1@xmath10 from g144 - 016 ) by comparing their finding charts drawn from first and second epoch digitized sky survey ( dss ) images . in another survey for substellar companions to nearby stars ,",
    "( 2001 ) report the discovery of three faint companions to known nearby stars based on their ir colors as obtained from the 2mass survey .",
    "one of the secondaries ( g216 - 7 b ) was also identified as a previously unrecognized faint proper motion companion , visible on the first and second epoch dss images .",
    "these two studies suggest that a systematic search for proper motion companions on palomar sky survey plates should reveal several more distant companions to known nearby stars .",
    "we have initiated a systematic , automated search for high proper motion stars using the dss ( lpine _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in the fields at low galactic latitudes , where the nltt catalog is clearly deficient ( @xmath11 star per square degree at @xmath12 , compared with @xmath13 stars per square degree at @xmath14 ) .",
    "we are using the superblink software , developed by sl , which works as an automated blink comparator .",
    "we have so far discovered several thousand stars that are well within the limits of the nltt catalog ( @xmath15 yr@xmath16 , @xmath17 ) but have been missed by luyten for a variety of reasons .",
    "we suspect that most of the stars have been missed because of the obvious difficulties involved when visually searching for moving objects in very crowded fields with the blink comparator .",
    "a computer - based search proves to be much more powerful and efficient .    by comparing the list of new high proper motion stars found by our software with objects listed in the gj catalog",
    ", we have discovered 5 common proper motion companions to gj objects previously listed as single stars . in this paper , we present spectroscopic observations of those newly identified wide multiples .",
    "one of the companions , gj 4153b , has already been discovered serendipitously by mccarthy , zuckermann , & becklin ( 2001 ) .",
    "the other four common proper motion companions are being cited here for the first time .",
    "this paper presents spectroscopic follow - up of the five common proper motion pairs , which confirms that they are physically related , low - mass , m dwarf companions to the known gj stars .",

    "each candidate high proper motion star is verified visually by blinking @xmath20 sub - images centered on the candidate ; bogus detections from e.g. plate artifacts , dust specks , scanning errors , are thus eliminated . as a preliminary study",
    ", we have investigated an area of the sky delimited by @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and covering the low galactic latitudes region ( @xmath23 ) . within these limits ,",
    "our superblink software has identified 18,953 stars with @xmath24 yr@xmath16 , all of which have been confirmed by visually blinking the candidates images . we have found a total of 4,287 stars with @xmath15 yr@xmath16 , of which 2,107 are `` new '' stars not listed in the nltt catalog but within its limits .",
    "the area under study covers an area @xmath25 square degrees , and contains a total of 346 stars listed in the gj catalog .",
    "we used the vizier web interface at the _ centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg _ to correlate all of our stars with @xmath24 yr@xmath16 with the gj catalog of nearby stars .",
    "we looked for any object in our catalog located within @xmath26 of a known nearby star , and verified whether the object had a proper motion similar in magnitude and orientation as the proper motion of the gj star .",

    "we verified with the simbad astronomical database and confirmed that the other 4 companions had never been cited in the literature before .",
    "all 5 stars were selected for follow - up spectroscopic observations , since mccarthy , zuckermann , & becklin ( 2001 ) did not publish a spectrum for gj 4153b .",
    "spectra of the five systems were obtained at the lick observatory with the kast spectrograph mounted on the 3.0-m shane telescope , under photometric conditions on the night of july 23 - 24 , 2001 ( heliocentric julian date 2,452,114 ) .",
    "longslit spectra were obtained with the stars centered on a 2.5@xmath9 wide slit .",
    "the instrument rotator was used , and set for each object such that the slit was oriented at the parallactic angle in order to avoid slit losses due to atmospheric differential refraction ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "four spectroscopic standards were observed during the run ( feige 110 , pg 1545 + 035 , pg1708 + 602 , and wolf 1346 , see massey & gronwall 1990 ) , and were used for calibration and as templates for the removal of telluric lines . in order to correct for the fringing on the ccd , which is significant on the red channel of the kast spectrograph redward of 7500  , we obtained separate dome flats for each target at the same telescope orientations ( azimuth - altitude ) as the observations .",
    "reduction was carried out with iraf , using the standard procedure for the reduction of longslit spectra ( doslit ) , including calibration and removal of the telluric lines .",
    "the resulting spectra are presented for each system in figures 1 - 5 , with both the primary and the secondary plotted on the same graph _ on a logarithmic scale _ to emphasize the difference in the monochromatic fluxes .",

    "we have also used the cah1/tio5 , cah2/tio5 , and cah3/tio5 ratios ( see gizis 1997 ) to determine whether the stars are dwarfs or subdwarfs ; the m stars are all clearly dwarfs under this system . the values of the tio5 , cah1 , cah2 , cah3 indices are listed in table 2 along with the estimated spectral types .",

    "we have confirmed the suspicion of mccarthy , zuckerman , & becklin ( 2001 ) that a significant number of known nearby stars have unrecognized distant companions that are recorded in the digitized sky survey .",
    "we believe that this is largely due to the incompleteness of published proper motion surveys , which is especially bad in the crowded fields of the milky way .",
    "our automated search for high proper motion stars at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath23 ) in the region @xmath68ra@xmath69 dec@xmath70 , has turned up over 2000 new high proper motion stars , of which 4 were found to be unrecognized common proper motion companions of known nearby stars ( we also recovered the companion found by mccarthy , zuckerman , & becklin 2001 ) .",
