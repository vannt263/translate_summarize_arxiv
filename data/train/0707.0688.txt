    "in this paper , we study the ground states of @xmath1 unit classical @xmath2 spins , @xmath11 , having a hamiltonian of the form @xmath12 where @xmath4 s are arbitrary real numbers  positive , negative or zero .",
    "such hamiltonians with arbitrary bonds and couplings are of interest in the context of disordered systems , especially spin glasses [ 1 ] .",
    "one of the interesting questions is the behavior of the ground state energy as the spin space dimension , @xmath5 , is increased .",
    "for example one can study the behavior of such models when @xmath5 is large . in this context",
    ", hastings [ 2 ] proved that for @xmath1 spins beyond a spin space dimension of @xmath13 the ground state energy does not decrease any further and also that this bound is saturated .",

    "al . [ 4 ] and for a relaxed version of maxcut problem of theoretical computer science [ 5 ] .",
    "an interesting question is the behavior of the _ average _ number of non - zero spin space components ( average over disorder ) in the ground state , as a function of the number of spins , @xmath1 . for the infinite range model with gaussian",
    "distributed @xmath4 s , this number increases as @xmath14 where @xmath15 [ 2,3 ] .",
    "lee , dhar and young [ 6 ] have numerically determined @xmath16 for several different models .",
    "we also derive both upper and lower bounds on the ground state energy of @xmath17 spins in terms of the ground state energy when they are replaced by @xmath2 spins ( @xmath18 ) keeping the couplings , @xmath4 s , the same . a stronger bound",
    "is also provided for ising spins ( @xmath19 ) when all couplings are antiferromagnetic and @xmath0 is low .",
    "we also consider the problem of finding the ground state of such a hamiltonian [ 7 ] .",
    "we study the inverse problem  how to find a ( non - trivial ) hamiltonian of the form in equation ( 1 ) so that a given spin state \\{@xmath20 } is the ground state .",
    "this question is trivial for ising spins .",
    "one just assigns a non - negative @xmath4 if the spins are parallel , and a non - positive @xmath4 if they are anti - parallel .",
    "however with @xmath2 spins @xmath21 the problem is non - trivial and in some cases there is no ( non - zero ) solution , for example , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with the three spins non - coplanar . in general , to find the desired set of couplings , @xmath4 s , we can express the hamiltonian in terms of the angles of the spherical polar coordinates of the spins and set the derivatives with respect to the angles equal to zero at the angles corresponding to the desired ground state .",
    "this gives a set of linear relations between the couplings , @xmath4 s .",
    "in addition , to ensure that this extremum is a minimum , and not a maximum or a saddle point , we have the additional constraint of the hessian being positive semi - definite .",
    "finding @xmath4 s which simultaneously satisfy the linear relations as well as the positive semidefiniteness constraint on the hessian is non - trivial .",
    "it is a semi - definite programming problem [ 8 ] for which fast algorithms and their software implementations are available .",

    "* proof * let us summarise the idea of the proof before getting into the details .",
    "suppose we have a ground state which has more than @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "starting fron the correlation matrix of this state we construct another matrix which is the correlation matrix of a spin state which is embedded in one less spin space dimension but has the same energy .",
    "this construction always works whenever the spin state is embedded in more than @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "since , as shown above , @xmath52 for @xmath51 this implies that for @xmath60 , @xmath59 , as desired .",
    "we now discuss the proof . when the spins are @xmath57 vectors let \\{@xmath10 } be a ground state .",
    "consider the correlation matrix , @xmath36 , with elements @xmath65 for all @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",

    "consider @xmath70 where @xmath71 is symmetric with @xmath72 .",
    "this leaves @xmath73 free parameters in @xmath71 and ensures that @xmath74 is also symmetric and the zero eigenvalues of @xmath36 and the corresponding eigenvectors are not perturbed .",

    "this ensures that the diagonal elements of @xmath74 remain unchanged .",
    "the @xmath73 free parameters of @xmath71 must satisfy the @xmath1 linear homogenous equations ( 5 ) .",
    "hence whenever @xmath77 such a non - zero @xmath71 will exist and we can increase @xmath78 till one of the first @xmath41 eigenvalues of @xmath36 becomes zero . thus we obtain a matrix @xmath74 which is the correlation matrix of a spin state embedded in @xmath79 dimensions . as shown in the next paragraph ,",
    "this spin state is a ground state . thus applying this procedure",
    "repeatedly we obtain a ground state embedded in atmost @xmath80 dimensions .",
    "the matrix @xmath71 chosen above is such that for @xmath78 small enough @xmath81 are _ both _ correlation matrices of valid spin states with energy @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "since we started from a @xmath36 which was a ground state this can happen only if @xmath83 i.e. if @xmath84 was a neutral direction .",
    "thus the correlation matrix @xmath74 also corresponds to a ground state .",
    "hence we have provided a construction for continuously deforming a ground state and bringing it to lie in an atmost @xmath24 dimensional subspace of the spin space without changing the energy , thus proving the desired result .",
    "* theorem 2 * the bound in theorem 1 is the best possible , i.e. there exist values of \\{@xmath4 } such that @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "* proof * consider three spins @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , see figure 1 .",
    "it is easy to see that for this system of three spins in the ground state @xmath87 is perpendicular to @xmath88 .",
    "if we integrate over @xmath89 , we get an effective interaction between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "now construct a set of @xmath41 spins with this effective interaction between every pair of them ( including the intermediate spins the total number of spins will be @xmath92 ) .",
    "their energy gets fully minimised only when these @xmath41 spins are perpendicular to each other which happens only in an atleast @xmath93 dimensional space thus completing the proof .    .",
    "shown are three of those members of the sequence for which @xmath94 is an integer ( such @xmath1 s are @xmath95 ) .",
    "rest of the members are obtained by adding appropriate number of free spins to the example of the last @xmath1 for which @xmath96 is an integer eg .",
    "@xmath97 example has two more free spins added to the @xmath98 example . ]",
    "we have seen that @xmath99 for @xmath8 .",
    "now we will derive an _ upper _ bound on @xmath7 in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "this result ( theorem 3 ) generalises a known result on the performance of goemans - williamson algorithm for maxcut problem of theoretical computer science [ 5 ] .",
    "the result by goemans and williamson , when translated into statistical physics language , would correspond to the special case of @xmath19 .",
    "theorem 4 is a translation of a known result on maxcut problem into statistical physics language [ 5 ] .",
    "the connection between the problem of finding the ground states of ising spins and maxcut problem has been known before[9 ]",
    ".    it will be helpful to summarise the overall strategy before getting into the details .",
    "suppose the various possible orientations of @xmath17 spins occur according to an arbitrary given probability distribution .",
    "then the energy is also a random variable and the expected value of the energy will always be greater than or equal to the ground state energy , i.e. @xmath100 $ ] , where @xmath101 $ ] denotes the expected value of the energy of @xmath17 spins . if we choose the probability distribution in such a way that we are able to bound @xmath101 $ ] in terms of @xmath0 from above we would have obtained the desired result .",
    "now we give the derivation in detail .",
    "first we define a randomised procedure for obtaining an @xmath17 state , say \\{@xmath102 } , from the ground state \\{@xmath103 } of @xmath2 spins . in the spin space of @xmath2 spins",

    "hence we can find a lower bound on @xmath113 , denoted by @xmath114 , which gives @xmath115    also replacing @xmath116 by @xmath117 in this inequality we get @xmath118    for @xmath119 , using ( 9 ) , we get @xmath120    for @xmath121 , using ( 10 ) , we get @xmath122    summing ( 11 ) over all those @xmath123-pairs for which @xmath119 and ( 12 ) over all those @xmath123-pairs for which @xmath121 and adding we get @xmath124 = - \\sum_{i > j }",
