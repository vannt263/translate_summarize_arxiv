    "spin currents are a central theme in spintronics since they are intimately associated with the manipulation and transport of spins in small structures and devices.@xcite spin currents can be generated by means of the spin hall effect ( she ) and detected by the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe).@xcite of special interest are multilayers made of normal metals ( n ) and ferromagnets ( f ) . when an electric current flows through n , an she spin current flows towards the interfaces , where it can be absorbed as a spin - transfer torque ( stt ) on the ferromagnet .",
    "this stt affects the magnetization damping@xcite or even switches the magnetization.@xcite the ishe can be used to detect spin currents pumped by the magnetization dynamics excited by microwaves@xcite or temperature gradients ( spin seebeck effect).@xcite    recently , magnetic insulators have attracted the attention of the spintronics community .",
    "yttrium iron garnets ( yig ) , a class of ferrimagnetic insulators with a large band gap , are interesting because of their very low magnetization damping .",
    "their magnetization can be activated thermally to generate the spin seebeck effect in yig@xmath1pt bilayers.@xcite by means of the she , spin waves can be electrically excited in yig via a pt contact , and , via the ishe , subsequently detected electrically in another pt contact.@xcite spin transport at an n@xmath1f interface is governed by the complex spin - mixing conductance @xmath2.@xcite the prediction of a large real part of @xmath2 for interfaces of yig with simple metals by first principles calculations@xcite has been confirmed by experiments.@xcite    magnetoresistance ( mr ) is the property of a material to change the value of its electrical resistance under an external magnetic field . in normal metals its origin",
    "is the lorentz force.@xcite the dependence of the resistance on the angle between current and magnetization in metallic ferromagnets is called anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) .",
    "the transverse component of the amr is also called the planar hall effect ( phe ) , _ i.e. _ the transverse ( hall ) voltage found in ferromagnets when the magnetization is rotated in the plane of the film.@xcite both effects are symmetric with respect to magnetization reversal , which distinguishes them from the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) for magnetizations normal to the film , which changes sign under magnetization reversal.@xcite the physical origin of amr , phe , and ahe is the spin - orbit interaction , in contrast to the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) , which reflects the change in resistance that accompanies the magnetic field - induced magnetic configuration in magnetic multilayers.@xcite    here we propose a theory for a recently discovered magnetoresistance effect in pt@xmath1yig bilayer systems.@xcite this mr is remarkable since yig  is a very good electric insulator such that a charge current can only flow in pt .",
    "we explain this unusual magnetoresistance not in terms of an equilibrium static magnetic proximity polarization in pt,@xcite but rather in terms of a non - equilibrium proximity effect caused by the simultaneous action of the she and ishe and therefore call it spin hall magnetoresistance ( smr ) .",
    "this effect scales like the square of the spin hall angle and is modulated by the magnetization direction in yig via the spin - transfer at the n@xmath1f interface .",
    "our explanation is similar to the hanle effect - induced magnetoresistance in the two - dimensional electron gas proposed by dyakonov.@xcite here we present the details of our theory , which is based on the spin - diffusion approximation in the n layer in the presence of spin - orbit interactions@xcite and quantum mechanical boundary conditions at the interface in terms of the spin - mixing conductance.@xcite we also address f@xmath1n@xmath1f spin valves with electric currents applied parallel to the interface(s ) with the additional degree of freedom of the relative angle between the two magnetizations directions .",

    "we developed a theory for the smr in n@xmath1f and f@xmath1n@xmath1f systems that takes into account the spin - orbit coupling in n as well as the spin - transfer at the n@xmath1f interface(s ) . in a n@xmath1f bilayer system ,",
    "the smr requires spin - flip in n and spin - transfer at the n@xmath1f interface .",
    "our results explain the smr measured in ref .   both qualitatively and quantitatively with transport parameters that are consistent with other experiments .",
    "the degrees of spin accumulation in n that can be controlled by the magnetization direction is found to be very significant . in the presence of an imaginary part of the spin - mixing conductance @xmath44 we predicted a ahe - like signal ( shahe ) . such a signal was observed in ref .   and can be explained with values of @xmath44 that agree with first principles calculations.@xcite we furthermore analyzed f@xmath1n@xmath1f spin valves for parallel and perpendicular magnetization configurations . a maximal smr @xmath182",
    "is found for a collinear magnetization configuration in the limit that the spin - diffusion length is much larger than the thickness of the normal spacer .",
    "the smr vanishes when rotating the two magnetizations into a fixed perpendicular constellation .",
    "the smr torques under applied currents in n are expected to lead to magnetization dynamics of n@xmath1f and f@xmath1n@xmath1f structures .",
