    "the search of the higgs boson is one of the principal goals of the experiments at the lhc . depending on its mass",
    ", it will be searched for in various final states and with different production mechanisms .",
    "the production mechanism with a cross section only second to the gluon - gluon fusion one is the boson - boson fusion ( vbf ) .",
    "this mechanism , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbf ] , allows a very clean signature of the final state .",
    "the incoming fermions scatter at high energy and enter the active volume of the lhc detectors in the high rapidity regions .",
    "the presence of the forward and backward jets induced by the two fermions ( here called `` tag jets '' ) characterizes the event as vbf ( for a detailed study of the characteristic of these jets see for example @xcite .",
    "the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) production presents another important feature : being a pure electroweak process the color exchange between the w and z is minimal , hence the jet activity in the central part of the detector is very low , if not absent .",
    "these features are exploited to reject the backgrounds and identify the vbf sample among the data produced at hadron colliders , by requiring the events to have a pair of jets , in opposite directions with respect to the beam axis , in the forward - backward region , and no other jets in the central part of the detector .",
    "to correctly establish the higgs signal is therefore mandatory to know with good precision the identification efficiency of the forward - backward jets and the efficiency of the central jet veto . the best way to determine these numbers from the data , without relying on the monte carlo simulation , would be to use a well know standard model process with similar kinematics",
    "the production of a single z boson via vbf could be a powerful instrument to evaluate the sensitivity of lhc detectors to the vbf production of the higgs boson @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "a parton level feasibility study of the vbf z production measurement at lhc is presented . after the signal definition",
    ", the cuts used to enhance the signal with respect to irreducible pure electroweak backgrounds are discussed ; finally , the dominant background for this analysis , coming from the production of a z from @xmath0 fusion accompanied by two jets , is considered . the unfortunately negative conclusion ends this work .",
    "the signal events are z bosons , that subsequently decay into leptons , produced via vbf .",
    "the generation of these events is done with the matrix element montecarlo madgraph @xcite asking for a final state with two leptons and two quarks .",
    "the process is at the order @xmath1 .    a small subset of the diagrams that contribute to the production of the four fermions final state at the @xmath1 order ( @xmath2 ) are shown in figure [ fig : graphsignal ] .",
    "the total cross section is @xmath3  fb .    out of the complete set of diagrams ,",
    "the first one in the figure corresponds to the vbf signal , which is searched for .",
    "the other diagrams will be hereafter called the electroweak irreducible background . for the purpose of this study ,",
    "a set of selection cuts has been implemented at montecarlo level to isolate the signal from the other electroweak processes , based on the invariant masses of the final state leptons and on the flavour and charge of the initial and final state quarks : events surviving the selections listed in table [ tab : vbfmccuts ] constitute the signal sample , while the others compose the irreducible electroweak background .",
    "final states with electrons or muons only have been considered .",
    "the fraction of vbf like events is about 4.5% of the total production ( 0.18  pb ) , that corresponds to about 36 events produced at 10  tev with an integrated luminosity of 200  pb@xmath4 .",
    ".mc - level selections to isolate the vbf contribution from the other four fermions final state processes at the @xmath1 leading order . [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "one of the most powerful discovery channel for the higgs boson in all the available mass range , is the one where the higgs is produced via vector boson fusion .",
    "the presence of the forward - backward jets and the absence of jets activity in the central region are clear identification marks .",
    "the possibility to identify single z boson produced in vbf has been studied as a `` data driven '' method to measure the efficiency to reconstruct and identify the forward - backward jets and the efficiency of the central jet veto .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to isolate the signal events from the dominant background coming from single z produced in association with jets coming from qcd .",
