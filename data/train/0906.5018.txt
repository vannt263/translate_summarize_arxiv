    "thirdly , the strength of the magnetic fields in the shocked region is unknown , but its energy density ( @xmath66 ) is assumed to be a fraction @xmath67 of the internal energy .",
    "these assumed `` micro - physics '' parameters , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , whose values are obtained from spectral fits @xcite reflect a lack of knowledge of the underlying microphysics @xcite .    the typical observed emission frequency from an electron with ( comoving ) energy @xmath70 in a frame with a bulk lorentz factor",
    "@xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "three critical frequencies are defined by three characteristic electron energies .",
    "these are @xmath73 ( the injection frequency ) , @xmath74 ( the cooling frequency ) , and @xmath75 ( the maximum synchrotron frequency ) . in our simulations of grb afterglows , there is one additional relevant frequency , @xmath76 , due to synchrotron self - absorption at lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "the general agreement between the blast wave dynamics and the direct measurements of the fireball size argue for the validity of this model s dynamics @xcite .",
    "the shock is most likely collisionless , i.e. mediated by plasma instabilities @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic instabilities mediating the afterglow shock are expected to generate magnetic fields .",
    "afterglow radiation was therefore predicted to result from synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons @xcite .",
    "the observed spectrum of afterglow radiation is indeed remarkably consistent with synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated to a power - law distribution , providing support for the standard afterglow model based on synchrotron emission of shock accelerated electrons @xcite . in order to determine the luminosity and spectrum of synchrotron radiation",
    ", the strength of the magnetic field ( @xmath69 ) and the energy distribution of the electrons ( @xmath62 ) must be determined . due to the lack of a first principles theory of collisionless shocks , a purely phenomenological approach to the model of afterglow radiation was ascribed without investigating in detail the processes responsible for particle acceleration and magnetic field generation @xcite .",
    "rather , one simply assumes that a fraction @xmath69 of the post - shock thermal energy density is carried by the magnetic field , that a fraction @xmath64 is carried by electrons , and that the energy distribution of the electrons is a power - law , @xmath77 ( above some minimum energy @xmath78 which is determined by @xmath64 and @xmath62 ) , @xmath79 , @xmath64 and @xmath62 are treated as free parameters , determined by observations .",
    "it is important to clarify here that the constraints implied on these parameters by the observations are independent of any assumptions regarding the nature of the afterglow shock and the processes responsible for particle acceleration or magnetic field generation .",
    "any model should satisfy these observational constraints .",
    "the properties of synchrotron ( or  jitter \" ) emission from relativistic shocks will be determined by the magnetic field strength and structure and the electron energy distribution behind the shock .",
    "the characteristics of jitter radiation may be important to understanding the complex time evolution and/or spectral structure in gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "for example , jitter radiation has been proposed as a means to explain grb spectra below the peak frequency that are harder than the `` line of death '' spectral index associated with synchrotron emission @xcite , i.e. , the observed spectral power scales as @xmath80 , whereas synchrotron spectra are @xmath81 or softer @xcite .",

    "such shocks are well - resolved in existing pic simulations ; therefore , the microscopic structure can be studied in detail .",
