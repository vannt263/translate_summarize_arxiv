    "the method of qcd sum rules @xcite , based on the exploitation of wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) in the study of properties of individual hadrons , has been extensively applied to the decay constants of heavy mesons .",
    "an  important finding of these analyses was the observation of the strong sensitivity of the decay constants to the precise values of the input ope parameters and to the algorithm used for fixing the effective threshold @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity governs the accuracy of the quark ",
    "hadron duality approximation and , to a great extent , determines the numerical prediction for decay constants inferred from qcd sum rules : even if the parameters of the truncated ope  are known with high precision , the decay constants may be predicted with only a limited accuracy ; the latter represents their systematic uncertainty . in a series of papers @xcite , we proposed a new algorithm for fixing the effective threshold within the borel qcd sum rules which allowed  us to obtain realistic estimates  of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "our procedure opened the possibility to get predictions for the decay constants  with a controlled accuracy @xcite and thus allowed  us to address subtle effects that call for a profound accurate treatment , such as the ratios of the decay constants of heavy vector and pseudoscalar mesons @xcite or the strong isospin - breaking effects in the decay constants of heavy mesons  @xcite .    here",
    ", we discuss the application of another variant of qcd sum rules to isospin breaking in the decay constants of heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "our analysis takes advantage of the fact that the ope provides the analytic dependence of the correlation functions on the quark masses ; this allows us to study , e.g. , the impact of the light - quark mass on heavy - meson decay constants , thus providing access to the strong isospin - violation effects .",
    "the approach we describe below seems quite promising for a study of the dependence of a generic hadron observable on quark masses .    a typical borel qcd sum rule for the decay constant @xmath6 of a heavy ( pseudoscalar or vector ) @xmath7 meson @xmath8 of mass @xmath9 , consisting of a heavy quark @xmath10 with mass @xmath0 and a light quark @xmath11 with mass @xmath1 , has the form @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the borel parameter and @xmath14 is an integer that depends on the lorentz structure in the correlation function chosen for the sum rule and on the number of subtractions in the corresponding dispersion representation .",
    "nonperturbative effects appear on the r.h.s .  of ( [ srn ] ) at two places : as power corrections given in terms of vacuum condensates and in the effective threshold @xmath15 .",
    "depending on the chosen value of @xmath14 , nonperturbative effects are distributed  in a different way between power corrections and the effective threshold .",
    "we are interested in the dependence of the decay constants of heavy ",
    "light mesons on the quark masses , in particular , in the strong isospin - breaking effects in the decay constants ( i.e. , the difference between the decay constants of @xmath16  and @xmath17 mesons induced by the small mass difference @xmath18 ) .",
    "we therefore need to properly take into account all effects depending on the light - quark flavour @xmath11 in the correlation function of the appropriate @xmath19 interpolating  currents .    clearly , the @xmath1-dependence on the l.h.s .  of ( [ srn ] )",
    "is encoded both in the decay constant @xmath6 and in the meson mass  @xmath9 . on the r.h.s , the isospin - breaking ( ib )",
    "effects come from several sources : the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath20 , the @xmath1-dependence of the effective threshold @xmath21 , the @xmath1-dependence of the power corrections , and the flavour dependence of the quark condensates , in particular , of @xmath22 . in general , all these effects mix together , which renders  the goal of isolating the ib effects in @xmath6 a complicated task .",
    "a careful analysis has been carried out recently in @xcite , setting @xmath23 in the case of pseudoscalar and @xmath24 in the case of vector mesons .",
    "there is , however , a particular limiting case of the sum rule which simplifies the problem considerably .",
    "let us  take the sum rule ( [ srn ] ) for @xmath25  this corresponds to considering the correlation function of mass dimension 2 , see next section  and set @xmath26 , the so - called local - duality ( ld ) limit .",
    "then the generic sum rule is reduced to the form @xmath27 on the l.h.s .",
    ", the @xmath9 contribution has dropped out , thus opening a direct access to the @xmath1-dependence of the decay constant @xmath6 . on the r.h.s .  of ( [ srn ] ) ,",
    "all nonperturbative power corrections vanish : the borelized correlator has mass dimension 2 , whereas the lowest - dimensional vacuum condensates ( the quark condensate @xmath28 and the gluon condensate @xmath29 ) have dimension 4 .",
    "this means that their contribution to the sum rule comes with a power of @xmath30 and thus vanishes in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "noteworthy , all nonperturbative effects enter now through a single quantity  the effective threshold .",
    "the functional dependence of @xmath32 on the quark masses , in particular , on @xmath1 , may be determined from the general properties of the decay constants of heavy ",
    "light mesons in qcd , whereas the unknown numerical coefficients of this functional dependence may be obtained from a few well - measured values of the decay constants , e.g. , for nonstrange and strange heavy mesons .",
    "having at our disposal a parameterization of the ld effective threshold , eq .",
    "( [ sr0 ] ) allows us to study the decay constants of heavy ",
    "light pseudoscalar and vector mesons as functions of @xmath1 and to access the strong isospin - breaking effects related to the small difference of the @xmath33- and @xmath34-quark masses in qcd .",
    "we would like to emphasize that , as will be demonstrated below , the main @xmath1-dependence of the decay constants originates from the calculable @xmath1-dependence of the perturbative spectral densities .",
    "therefore , the ld limit opens the possibility of a reliable analysis of the @xmath1-dependence and the strong ib effects in the decay constants of heavy  light mesons ( and , in principle , also in other quantities ) .",

    "light pseudoscalar and vector mesons and obtain predictions for strong ib effects in the decay constants .",
    "section 5 gives our conclusions .",
    "the appendix collects some details of treating the isospin - breaking effects within the ope , which , in our opinion , deserve to be presented .",
    "let us consider two - point qcd sum - rules for decay constants of pseudoscalar ( @xmath37 ) and vector ( @xmath38 ) mesons built up of one massive quark @xmath10 with mass @xmath0 and one light quark @xmath11 with mass @xmath1 .",

    "the power corrections for the vector correlator @xmath56 are easily found from @xmath57 : @xmath58 .",
    "also the borelized power corrections for the vector correlator vanish in the limit @xmath26 .",

    "let us emphasize that in ( [ pia ] ) both the full spectral densities and the decay constants are scale - independent quantities .",

    "we would like to emphasize that the perturbative spectral density ( [ rhopert ] ) does not generate terms of order @xmath80 in the dual correlator ( [ pia ] ) .",
    "this observation will be crucial for discussing properties of the effective thresholds in  the next section .",

    "`` linear '' threshold : the chiral logs @xmath148 are neglected and the parameters @xmath160 and @xmath159 are fixed by the lattice qcd results for the decay constants at two @xmath1 values , for the isospin - symmetric and the strange heavy mesons .",

    "an important outcome of our analysis is that the variation of the decay constants with respect to @xmath1 comes to a  great extent ( 7080% of the full effect ) comes from the rigorously calculable dependence on @xmath1 of the perturbative spectral densities and is therefore under a good theoretical control .    as our final estimates of the ib , we take the average of the results corresponding to the linear and the linear + log effective thresholds in table [ table : results ] : @xmath171 sizeably larger uncertainties of the ib in the decay constants of vector mesons compared to pseudoscalar mesons are related to larger uncertainties of the input lattice qcd results for the corresponding ratios @xmath172 .",

    "this step can not be done easily : the ope for @xmath192 is only given by local @xmath186-symmetric condensates if one keeps @xmath195 large and negative ; a straightforward extension of the known power corrections to @xmath196 leads to a wrong result : it is known that if one naively extends power corrections in the vector three - point function to @xmath197 , then they do not satisfy the ward identity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    on the other hand , one can proceed by expanding @xmath198 in powers of the small quark mass ; then the mass derivatives emerge . translating the expression ( [ expansion ] ) into momentum space , to @xmath199 accuracy",
    "we obtain @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the full two - point function of @xmath186-symmetric qcd , and @xmath202 is the three - point function of the scalar current @xmath203 at zero momentum transfer , also calculated in the full @xmath186-symmetric theory .",
    "consequently , finding the leading - order @xmath186-breaking effects reduces to calculating the green functions in @xmath186-symmetric qcd .",
    "now , consider the correlation functions @xmath204 for the two - point function , we can write the dispersion representation @xmath205 using the well - known relation @xmath206 the three - point function at zero momentum transfer may be related to the mass derivative of the two - point function , which then leads to the appearance of the mass derivatives of the quark condensate",
