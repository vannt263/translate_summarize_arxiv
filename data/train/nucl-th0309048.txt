    "it was recognized by shlyakhter @xcite that isotopic ratios of fission products and secondary neutron absorption reactions that occurred with the oklo natural reactor phenomenon some 2 billion years ago could be used to test whether the fine - structure constant @xmath0 varies with time .",
    "specifically , if a neutron absorber ( e.g. , @xmath3sm ) has a low - energy neutron absorption resonance , and the excited compound state can decay by gamma emission , the resonance energy will change in a predictable way if @xmath0 varies . the overlap of the resonance with the reactor neutron spectrum will subsequently change thereby altering the ratios of nearby isotopes .",
    "in addition to @xcite , two other detailed analyses of the oklo phenomenon have been completed @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this note is to assess the validity of the assumption in these analyses that the neutron spectrum can be described by a maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution , and to determine the effects on the limit of the time variation of @xmath0 for different neutron spectra .",
    "the possibility of a non - mb spectrum was discussed in @xcite ( footnote 3 ) , but was not considered to be important . however , for the high - accuracy results presented in @xcite , the effects due to deviations from a mb spectrum become very important .",
    "the fact that the oklo phenomenon occurred was indicated when uranium taken from this mine was found to be deficient in @xmath4u ; subsequent tests confirmed this discovery . from core samples and knowledge of reactor dynamics , the age of the oklo phenomenon was determined to be about 2 billion years . the conditions necessary for the multiple reactor zones to exist can be used to place constraints upon many parameters such as concentrations of various elements , temperature , moderator type and concentration , _ etc .",
    "_ while the reactor was operating .",
    "for example , it can be shown that only hydrogen or deuterium could have served as moderators at oklo and hydrogen present in water or as hydration of the uranium oxide appears to be the only plausible choice . as a first approximation to the reactor geometry",
    ", it seems reasonable to assume that the oklo phenomenon was a homogeneous reactor of infinite extent .",
    "this simplifies the estimation of the multiplication factor @xmath5 and the neutron flux @xmath6 which we will see depends on the amount of hydrogen and neutron absorbing impurities in the ore .    with the present isotopic ratio of @xmath4u/@xmath7u , the maximum @xmath5 that can be obtained in a homogeneous mixture of water and natural uranium is @xmath8 , which occurs where there are 2.43 molecules of water per atom of uranium @xcite ( see table 18.1 , p. 612 ) .",
    "the fractional isotopic abundance of @xmath4u in natural u at present is 0.711% . extrapolating this result",
    "implies a @xmath4u relative isotopic concentration of about 1.2% to achieve @xmath9 .",
    "two billion years ago , the relative concentration of @xmath4u was about 3.7% ( due to the different lifetimes of @xmath4u and @xmath7u ) .",
    "this implies that two billion years ago , @xmath10 for a system with 2.4 h@xmath11o molecules / u atom .",
    "if such a large fractional concentration of water was present , the oklo reactor would have been highly divergent . of the possible effects that can reduce @xmath5 , the two most likely are a low water ( or hydrogen ) concentration in the u deposit , and the presence of impurities .",
    "it is interesting to note that the reactor would have been somewhat self - stabilizing as a runaway to high temperatures would drive water out of the ore deposit",
    ".    precise knowledge of the nature and concentration of neutron - absorbing impurities at the time the oklo reactor was running is lacking .",
    "however , we can make a reasonable estimate of the possible maximum absorption by impurities .",
    "the forgoing arguments can made rigorous by estimating @xmath5 as a function of the hydrogen atomic number density fraction , @xmath12 and the atomic fraction of absorbing impurities @xmath13 , relative to the number density of u atoms . with @xmath4u isotopic fraction @xmath14 , for thermal neutrons : @xmath15+\\rho_h\\sigma_a^h+\\sum_i \\rho_i\\sigma_a^i}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & 2.47 e^{-.7031 ( 1/f_h)^{.58}}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&{580x\\over 690x+2.7(1-x)+0.33 f_h + \\sum_i f_i\\sigma_a^i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of neutrons released per @xmath4u fission , @xmath17 is the resonance escape probability obtained from eqs .",
    "( 10.29 ) and ( 13.3 ) of @xcite , @xmath18 b is the @xmath4u fission cross section , @xmath19 b is the total @xmath4u total neutron absorption cross section , @xmath20 b is the @xmath7u total neutron absorption cross section , @xmath21 b is the hydrogen absorption cross section",
    ". the total impurity absorption can be parameterized by @xmath22 furthermore , the effects of oxygen have been neglected . for @xmath23 , @xmath5 as a function of @xmath24 , and as a function of impurity concentration parameterized by @xmath25 ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1 . with no impurities ,",
    "@xmath9 is achieved when @xmath26 . for a higher hydrogen concentration",
    ", the reactor would have run away and the resulting high temperatures would have driven water out of the ore ; the system was likely self - stabilizing to @xmath9 . as the impurity concentration , parameterized by @xmath25 in fig .",
    "1 , increases , @xmath24 required for @xmath9 increases also ; at @xmath27 , @xmath28 to achieve @xmath9 . for @xmath29",
    "b , it is not possible to achieve @xmath30 .",
    "it is also known that the reactor operated until @xmath31 which implies a more restrictive limit of @xmath32 b , for which @xmath33 .",
    "we note that criticality calculations at these high @xmath34u concentrations are subject to a number of corrections ( see @xcite , pp .",
    "463 - 468 ) so the figures derived here are to be considered as providing guidelines for the operation of the natural reactor which indicates that @xmath24 is about 3 , with @xmath35 .    a ubiquitous substance that offers a significant thermal neutron absorption cross section is sodium chloride .",
    "the thermal absorption cross section for sodium is @xmath36b , but for chlorine @xmath37 b which limits @xmath38 .",
    "the relative atomic concentrations of other impurities can be similarly estimated .",
    "it is well - known that when neutrons are moderated in the presence of a @xmath40 absorber ( such as u ) , the low - energy part of the spectrum becomes suppressed relative to a high - energy @xmath41 component of the flux .",
    "the relevant parameter that describes this suppression is ( @xcite , pp . 335- 340 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is net absorption cross section of the homogeneous mixture for a neutron rms velocity corresponding to the moderator temperature , @xmath44 is the net scattering cross section of the moderating atoms , and @xmath45 is the atomic mass of the moderating atoms . in the present case , for neutron energies about 1 ev , the atomic mass @xmath46 for h which is responsible for most of the neutron moderation . when @xmath47 , the @xmath41 tail contains the bulk of the neutrons .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 where the flux as a function of @xmath48 as obtained from a monte carlo calculation following the procedure in @xcite .",
    "for the parameters derived in the last section , that is @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath35 , @xmath51 .",
    "however , for neutron energies less than 1 ev , molecular effects become important ; it is no longer a good approximation to assume that the neutron moderation occurs by scattering from free atoms .",
    "the chemical bonding effect can be estimated by setting @xmath52 , so in the low neutron energy region ( @xmath53 ev ) , @xmath47 at 300 k , and scales with temperature as @xmath54 the elements @xmath3sm and @xmath55gd have low energy neutron resonances and are particularly interesting to test for possible time variation of @xmath0 .",
    "the formalism developed in @xcite for the effective cross section of a substance with a low - energy neutron resonance can be understood as follows .",
    "the interaction of a neutron with a nucleus can be parameterized through the optical model , where the hamiltonian is @xmath56 where the absorption rate for neutrons with energy @xmath57 is @xmath58 .",
    "the absorption cross section can be expressed as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the neutron momentum , @xmath61 is a parameter that depends upon the spins of the neutron and interacting nuclei , @xmath62 is the resonance energy and @xmath63 are the rates for neutron and gamma ray absorption respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for elements of interest here can be found in @xcite .",
    "the absorption cross section at a particular energy can also be described as the product of the rate of absorption and the times @xmath64 spent in the material , normalized to the propagation length @xmath65 , @xmath66 far away from @xmath62 , @xmath67 is nearly constant and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the velocity at which the cross section was measured .",
    "nuclei whose cross sections can be described this way are know as `` @xmath40 '' absorbers .",
    "this is a more efficient representation for thermal neutron absorption of many nuclei such as u.    the net absorption cross section is given by the integral of the cross section time the neutron flux @xmath70 , @xmath71 in assessing the effects of a varying low - energy resonance , because all @xmath40 cross sections follow the same universal function which have exactly the same form up to a constant , it is useful to define an effective relative cross section for the nuclei with a varying @xmath67 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the energy - dependent cross section , @xmath74 is the moderator temperature , @xmath6 and @xmath75 are the neutron flux and energy distributions , respectively , and @xmath69 is the velocity at which @xmath40 absorption cross sections are measured .    in this analysis and the others that have been performed so far , the finite temperature and motion of the absorbing nuclei is ignored .",
    "this is a small correction to the resonance width because @xmath76 for the nuclei being considered , so the absorber velocity is much lower than the neutron velocity .",
    "assuming @xmath77 at 300 k , as a function of @xmath74 , @xmath78 . a procedure similar to that described in @xcite ( numerical integration )",
    "was used to calculate the change in @xmath39 as a function of change in resonance energy , but replacing the mb spectrum with spectra derived from fig .",
    "2 . the same resonance parameters as employed in @xcite were used , and the numerical integration was tested with a mb spectrum for which the same results as fig . 1 of @xcite were obtained .",
    "it is possible to determine the value of the cross section for @xmath3sm , @xmath79 , from detailed isotopic analyses of core samples from oklo and similarly for @xmath55gd to determine @xmath80 .",
    "such an analysis was performed in @xcite and indicates that @xmath81 this result can be used subsequently to determine the ancient value of @xmath62 which can be compared to the present - day measured value .",
    "results of the numerical integration for @xmath3sm are shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of moderator temperature with @xmath77 at 300 k. in @xcite , the mean temperature of the oklo reactor was estimated to be about 600 k. from the curve for 600 k in fig . 3 ( expanded around the @xmath82 kb in the lower plot ) , we find that the change in resonance energy is @xmath83 \\times 10^{-3}\\ { \\rm ev}\\ ] ] which indicates more than a @xmath2 deviation from zero .",
    "note that thetwo solution \" problem does not really exist in this case , but the upper magnitude range is expanded .    in the calculation of the moderated neutron spectrum , effects of chemical bonds ( which suppress the low energy spectrum ) have been approximately included .",
    "as the atoms become more tightly bound , @xmath84",
    "so ( @xmath85 ) , and in this limit the neutron flux spectrum becomes pure @xmath41 ; the result of a calculation for this case is shown in fig .",
    "4 . in this case ,",
    "for which two solutions exist , @xmath86 this result is roughly consistent with the @xmath77 result ; reality likely is somewhere between the @xmath872 and @xmath88 results .",
    "however , the result for @xmath77 clearly indicates a non - zero change in @xmath62 at a level of more than @xmath2 .",
    "results for a calculation of @xmath55gd are shown in fig .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath55gd data is complicated by the presence of impurities , and an extensive analysis is given in @xcite .",
    "the oklo data imply @xmath89 kb , which , from fig .",
    "5 , indicates , for the left - hand solution , @xmath90 this is consistent with the @xmath3sm result because impurities shift @xmath62 slightly , and the simple @xmath41 spectrum overestimates @xmath62 .",
    "a shift in resonance energy can be related to a shift in @xmath0 by @xmath91 a reasonable estimate of @xmath92 mev was presented in @xcite , and is roughly the same for @xmath3sm and @xmath55gd . taking the result eq .",
    "( [ 149result ] ) determines @xmath93\\times 10^{-9}\\ ] ] which is non - zero by more than @xmath2 .",
    "the central value plus twice the upper uncertainty can be used to set a 95% confidence limit on the magnitude of the integrated rate of change over the last two billion years @xmath94 by assuming higher temperatures , this limit decreases slightly . however",
    ", a significant modification of this result requires temperatures beyond physically reasonable values as assumed in @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the neutron absorption resonance parameters ( e.g. , the neutron and gamma widths ) , other than @xmath62 , do not change significantly with @xmath0 . in estimating @xmath95 it was assumed that @xmath62 represents a fixed energy above the ground states of nuclei with @xmath45 and @xmath96 , and @xmath95 is approximately the difference in the coulomb energies of the ground states .",
    "this result is in agreement with a more sophisticated analysis @xcite .",
    "if a @xmath40 absorber is present in the moderator of a neutron chain reactor , the neutron energy spectrum can deviate significantly from the a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the oklo phenomenon was rich in uranium which is a strong @xmath40 absorber . by considering realistic deviations from a maxwell - boltzmann low - energy neutron spectrum",
    ", we have shown that a recent analysis of the oklo natural reactor phenomenon implies an non - zero ( @xmath97 ) variation of @xmath0 over the last 2 billion years .",
    "the result is of opposite sign and an order of magnitude smaller than a recent astrophysical determination of the change in @xmath0 @xcite , which is non - zero , but over a different time scale .",
    "it has been suggested that the time variation of @xmath0 is not monotonic @xcite .",
    "our results are probably accurate to within 20% ; a full mcnp model of the reactor , assuming reasonable estimates of the temperature and impurities are possible , would be useful in light of the importance and interest in the possibility of a varying @xmath0 . finally , these results might be interpreted more efficiently in terms of @xmath98 for which the sensitivity is about two orders of magnitude higher than the sensitivity to @xmath0 variation @xcite ."
