    "the two - sublattice model , in which co2 and co3 ions form the one sublattice , denoted as 1 , and co1 and co4 ions form the other one , denoted as 2 , can be applied .",
    "the modulated , perpendicular to the _ b _ axis components average out to zero and only the net magnetizations of both sublattices are essential , fig .  [ fig4]c .",
    "4 .   the deflection of the net magnetizations of both sublattices by 4.6@xmath5 from the _ b _ axis and the possibility of existence of domains , in which the sign of this deflection is different , can be neglected and it can be assumed that the net magnetizations are directed along the _ b _ axis .",
    "the sublattice magnetized  along \" the field ( denoted as @xmath41 in fig .  [ fig4]c )",
    "is rigid , has a well defined magnetization modulus , and its magnetic anisotropy can be analyzed by using the anisotropy constant @xmath42 .",
    "the sublattice magnetized  against \" the external field ( denoted as @xmath43 ) is  weak \" and behaves as an anisotropic paramagnet located within an effective field , @xmath44 , composed of the external field , @xmath14 , and the exchange ( i.e. molecular ) field , @xmath45 , produced by the  rigid \" sublattice . 7 .",
    "the magnetization of the  weak \" sublattice is equal to : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 identifies the components along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes .",
    "8 .   for @xmath48 , the sublattice 1 is the rigid one and the sublattice 2 is the susceptible one . for @xmath49 ,",
    "both sublattices exchange their behavior , that means the sublattice 1 becomes the susceptible one , while the sublattice 2 becomes the rigid one .",
    "9 .   for @xmath50",
    "both sublattices are indistinguishable , therefore the torque goes through zero at these angles .    by taking the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 values , which fit the best the dependences of net magnetization on @xmath18 applied along the _ b _ axis ( measured in ref .   and in the present work , fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) , and by treating @xmath42 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 as fitted parameters , a good agreement between the measured and the calculated angle dependences of torque was achieved ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "the values of the parameters fitting the experimental data the best are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "these values imply that at the transition point the sublattice magnetized  along \" the field becomes  harder \" ( @xmath42 grows ) , whereas the other sublattice becomes  weaker \" ( its total susceptibility along the _ b _ axis remains unchanged , whereas the susceptibility along the _ c _ axis grows ) .",
    "nevertheless , the _ b _ axis remains the easy magnetization direction ( the sign of @xmath42 , characterizing the anisotropy of the sublattice 1 , does not change and the total susceptibility of the sublattice 2 remains larger along the _ b _ axis than along the _ c _ axis ) .",
    "this fact explains why no anomalies are observed at the transition point on temperature and field dependences of magnetization measured in the magnetic field applied along the _ b _ axis , fig .",
    "the uncertainty of each parameter given in table [ tab2 ] was estimated by keeping all other parameters fixed and checking that no noticeable change of the theoretical curve appears for the values of the examined parameter lying within the uncertainty range , whereas for the values beyond that range , fit quality deteriorates evidently .",
    "it should be mentioned that the proposed method of analysis , in which 9 fitted parameters are involved , should be treated rather as a qualitative method of elucidating the physical processes occurring in the sample , not as an accurate method for determining physical parameters , e.g. @xmath42 .",
    "in conclusion , it was shown that in licopo@xmath6 , the second order phase transition from the paramagnetic to the weakly ferromagnetic phase is accompanied by a @xmath24-shaped anomaly of specific heat , which can be described as the logarithmic divergence ( [ eq2 ] ) , characteristic of a 2d ising system .",
    "the deviation from the purely 2d behaviour was ascribed to the quasi-2d character of the magnetic structure .",
    "the first - order phase transition induced by an external magnetic field @xmath58 t parallel to the _ b _ axis , appearing at @xmath39 k , was discovered and shown to be related to the change of magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "support of swiss nsf for crystal growth ( prior to 1996 ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "this work was partly supported by the polish ministry of science and higher education from funds for science for 2008 - 2011 years , as a research project ( 2047/b / h03/2008/34 ) , and by the european union , within the european regional development fund , through the innovative economy grant ( poig.01.01.02 - 00 - 108/09 ) .",
    "we assumed that the simplest description of the licopo@xmath6 antiferromagnet can be based on the two - sublattice approximation , in which co2 and co3 ions form the one sublattice , denoted as 1 , and co1 and co4 ions form the other one , denoted as 2 ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig4]c ) .",
    "then , we can apply a molecular field approximation , which must be modified in such a way that the presence of an extremely weak , net spontaneous magnetization , @xmath59 , found experimentally,@xcite will be mimicked .",
    "an approach to the latter effect can be based on considerations concerning a much simpler case of a ferromagnet .",
    "it is known that within the molecular field approximation , the magnetization of a ferromagnet can be determined graphically as the intersection point of the brillouin function : @xmath60 and of the linear relation between the @xmath61 parameter and the magnetization : @xmath62 where @xmath51 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 denote , respectively , molecular field , saturation magnetization , @xmath64-factor and spin of the magnetic ion . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , for @xmath66 , in zero magnetic field the intersection point is located in the plateau of the brillouin function and the spontaneous magnetization reaches nearly the saturation value @xmath63",
    ". then , if the external field @xmath67 is applied along @xmath51 , the magnetization changes only slightly , whereas if the same field is applied against @xmath51 , the intersection point shifts to the region of noticeably smaller magnetization values , where also the curvature of the brillouin function and the susceptibility are larger .    since for licopo@xmath6 , the temperature of the first - order transition is @xmath68 k , @xmath51 ( estimated based on the @xmath1 value ) is @xmath318 t , and the applied fields ranging from 6 to 9 t are of the order from 0.3 to 0.5 @xmath51",
    ", we can expect a similar behavior for this more complex case of weakly ferromagnetic antiferromagnet .",
    "thus , we assumed that the sublattice 1 , magnetized along the field , figs .",
    "[ fig4]c and [ fig7 ] , is rigid , with well defined modulus of its magnetization , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the magnetic moment of one co@xmath71 ion ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 is the volume of the orthorhombic unit cell ( containing 4 formula units ) . as the result , magnetic anisotropy of this sublattice can be described by using the anisotropy constant @xmath42 . on the contrary ,",
    "the sublattice 2 , magnetized against the field , is susceptible and the modulus of its magnetization is a function of value and direction of the field @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the formalism involving anisotropy constants is inapplicable and we can describe a magnetic anisotropy of the sublattice 2 by introducing different magnetic susceptibilities along different crystallographic directions .",
    "( color online ) molecular field approximation for a standard ferromagnet .",
    "red curve presents the brillouin function .",
    "straight solid line presents the case of zero external field .",
    "the dash - dot and dashed lines show , respectively , the cases of the external field applied along and against the molecular field . ]",
    "( coming beyond the molecular field approximation we can say that the real licopo@xmath6 magnetic structure can have a form of a very weakly spread out `` fan'',@xcite fig .",
    "then , we can imagine that the molecular field picture described above is a simplification of the fact that the `` fan '' of the sublattice magnetized along the filed folds slightly , whereas the fan of the sublattice magnetized against the field spreads out considerably under influence of the magnetic field . )    besides we assumed that the deflection of the magnetization by 4.6@xmath5 away from the _ b _ axis and the possibility of existence of domains differing in sign of this deflection , i.e. , @xmath76 or @xmath77 , has no noticeable effect on the angle dependences of torque and on the net magnetization value along the _ b _ axis and can be neglected .",
    "thus , in our considerations was assumed that the _ b _ axis is the easy magnetization direction for both sublattices .",
    "validity of this assumption has been verified by direct calculations .    under the assumptions given above , for @xmath78 the magnetizations of both sublattices",
    "are given by the expressions : @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    ". then , the theoretical resultant magnetization of the sample , calculated according to the formula : @xmath88 should be equal to the experimental one , given by eq .",

    "( [ app3 ] ) and the coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath95 were determined by fitting the function ( [ app4 ] ) to the @xmath96 dependences ( since we had access to the @xmath96 dependences measured for @xmath40 and 10 k only , the @xmath94 and @xmath95 coefficients for @xmath97 k were determined by extrapolating the ones found for @xmath40 and 10 k ) .",
    "then , knowing these parameters , @xmath51 was determined by solving eq .",
