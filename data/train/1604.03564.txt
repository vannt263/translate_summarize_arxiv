    "since we are stacking on stellar mass - limited galaxy samples , this is expected due to the increase in the fraction of quiescent and/or quenching galaxies in the cluster environment . in the higher redshift clusters , however , the stacked average sfr is flat with cluster - centric radius , indicating that the fraction of quiescent or low sfr galaxies does not yet exceed the field value at this epoch .",
    "similarly , the flat average ssfr indicates that cluster galaxies at @xmath158 are still forming stars for their stellar mass at rates similar to field galaxies at the same epoch .",
    "these trends are fully consistent with the behavior in the pacs - detected cluster galaxy population seen in this work , as well as in @xcite , and further demonstrates that our cluster sample is undergoing a transition from the epoch of active sf to effective quenching during this era .",

    "the difference in amplitude between the full iscs sample and the higher mass pacs - selected subsample is broadly consistent with this relation ( though see above for a discussion on the cluster - to - cluster variation in sf activity relative to cluster richness for the pacs - selected sample ) .",

    "strong variations in the mass - normalized integrated sfrs of massive clusters at @xmath193 were first noted in @xcite ; we similarly find a wide range in @xmath168sfr / m@xmath179 for our cluster sample .",
    "this scatter in the sf activity at roughly fixed halo mass introduces the possibility of significant bias in single cluster studies .",
    "differences in the sf activity of cluster populations is likely due to a variety of factors , including differences in assembly history and dynamical state . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "even relatively evolved , rich clusters at @xmath4 show a wide range of morphologies .",
    "the x - ray observations available for a few clusters ( id8 , id10 , id11 ) in our sample indicate that these clusters are unrelaxed , with associated filamentary structures , and , in one case , may have undergone a recent interaction or merging event @xcite . as clusters at higher",
    "redshift are more likely to have recently experienced evolution in their dynamical state , it becomes more and more important to work with statistical cluster samples which can be used to average over these variations .",
    "of particular note in our sample are the clusters id6 ( @xmath99 ) and id10 ( @xmath100 ) . as described in section  [ sec : membership ] , these two clusters have a small angular separation ( @xmath216 or @xmath101mpc at @xmath20 ) , and given their overlap both spatially and in photometric redshift space , we have assured no double - counting of galaxies by assigning membership based on the maximum integrated pdf of the photometric redshifts . as a system and individually , these two clusters stand out among our sample , with @xmath168sfr per area 2 - 9 times larger within the virial radius than in the surrounding outskirts . id6 and id10 have the highest fractions of pacs - detected , ir - luminous galaxies within 250 kpc in our sample , @xmath217 and 50@xmath65 , respectively , relative to a median fraction of @xmath218 for the full cluster sample .",

    "this transition epoch is remarkably similar to the behavior we see for the evolution of sf activity in cluster galaxies , wherein sf quenching becomes effective around the same epoch .",
    "agn could provide a mechanism for quenching sf by heating and/or expelling cold gas .",

    "this has important implications for overdense environments where the hot icm in clusters will suppress new gas accretion from cold flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we consider this result in conjunction with : 1 ) the flat @xmath155 of ir - luminous cluster galaxies as a function of cluster - centric radius ( figure  [ fig : sf1 ] ) for both of our redshift bins , and 2 ) our stacking analysis ( figure  [ fig : stack2 ] ) , which shows a marked decrease in the @xmath155 at small projected radii at @xmath144 for stellar mass - limited cluster samples . taken together , these lines of evidence indicate that these clusters are   undergoing a rapid build - up of the red sequence , with star forming galaxies experiencing significant quenching over short timescales ( the period spanning the median redshifts of our bins , z=1.46 to z=1.26 , is @xmath228 gyr ) , rather than a gradual decrease in the sfrs of cluster sfgs over long timescales .  further constraining",
    "the timescale to fully quench cluster galaxies will require measurements of the star formation histories in individual cluster galaxies , both star forming and quenched , over a long redshift baseline .",
    "strangulation typically occurs over several gyr , too long to cause the transition seen in the star forming fraction of cluster galaxies at @xmath20 , indicating that it is not dominating quenching in high redshift clusters .",
