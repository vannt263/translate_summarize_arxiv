    "the high growth velocity of heterogeneous temperature induced nucleation of martensite , which is of the order of magnitude of sound ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ? *  ff . ) ) , is one of the reasons why the process of nucleation is not yet satisfactory understood . as pointed out in (",
    "23 ) `` the kinetics of martensitic transformations are depended mainly on the nucleation process as each plate grows rapidly to its limiting size '' and as a consequence `` it is often found that the plates of martensite formed ( ... ) have a constant lenght : thickness ratio '' until `` growth ceases because of plastic deformation '' .",
    "different models ( e.g. @xcite ) have been proposed to explain the formation and predict properties of such plates .",
    "it has been shown theoretically and experimentally that the availability of a free surface can have a significant influence on the nucleation process . in @xcite",
    "a single crystal of fe - ni was coated with a ni - rich surface layer to inhibit nucleation from the free surface with the effect that the formation of martensite was completely suppressed during slow cooling . applying a similar procedure to an in - cd alloy however",
    "did not show a difference between the coated and uncoated crystal . in a related experiment on cu - al - ni single- and polycrystals with varying grain - sizes",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the energy needed for bulk nucleation is significantly higher than that required for corner nucleation or to move a planar interface .",
    "a single crystal of the same alloy was considered in @xcite where it was shown experimentally and theoretically that corner nucleation is energetically preferable over interior nucleation .",
    "however if a free surface is not available , for instance because of a relatively large grain - size or by a coating as described above , it is of interest to establish criteria for interior nucleation .",
    "the present paper investigates the energetic properties of interior nucleation using a variational model based on non - linear elasticity first introduced in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where a nucleus forms with an array of interfacial dislocation , in this model the material is assumed to deform purely elastically without considering plasticity .",
    "further interfacial energy is not taken into account .",
    "this is justifiable by recent experiments in @xcite on ti - ni - pd and ti - ni - au crystals with very low hysteresis where it has been observed that structures with very complex interfaces form , even though less complex interfaces are already kinematically compatible , so that the contribution from interfacial energy must be negligible .",
    "a particularly interesting case of interior nucleation is self - accommodation . using the ball - james ( @xcite ) model it has been shown in @xcite that a necessary and sufficient condition for self - accommodation is that the austenite and martensite have equal volume . in this case",
    "the martensite can rearrange itself such that it matches the austenite along any surface and thus interior nucleation is energetically as preferable as nucleation from the boundary .",
    "however in general we expect to have a volume change during transformation , so that any inclusion of martensite within austenite necessarily has a region where it is neither on the austenite nor on the martensite wells",
    ". we will refer to this region as the interpolation layer and it can loosely be understood as the elastic equivalent to having interfacial energy and plasticity . by the classical theory of heterogeneous nucleation in order to transform a given region of austenite to martensite `` the negative free energy change resulting from the formation of a given volume of a more stable phase [ the martensite ] is opposed by a positive free energy change due to the creation of an interface [ the interpolation layer ] between the initial phase and the new phase '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus our criterion for interior nucleation is that the energy of the inclusion is lower than the energy of the parent phase , i.e. the austenite .",
    "it seems to have first been shown qualitatively in @xcite that for a sufficiently flat cylindrical inclusion nucleation is always energetically preferable over the pure austenite . in this paper",
    "we develop quantitative estimates on the energy difference between a nucleus and the austenite depending on the temperature and the assumed growth of the free energy density away from the wells .",

    "following @xcite microstructures correspond to minimising sequences of the total free energy @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the undistorted austenite at temperature @xmath6 and @xmath7 maps a point @xmath8 in the reference configuration to a point @xmath9 in the deformed configuration . in this continuum model the mesoscopic free energy density",
    "@xmath0 depends only on the deformation gradient @xmath10 and temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the deformation @xmath11 corresponds to pure austenite and thus , since we are interested in modelling inclusions of martensite within austenite , @xmath12 has to satisfy the homogeneous displacement boundary condition @xmath13 on @xmath14 . furthermore @xmath0 respects frame indifference , i.e. @xmath15 and the cubic symmetry of the austenite , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 , @xmath18 denote the set of martensitic wells .",
    "then for a fixed temperature @xmath19 below the transition temperature we assume @xmath20 clearly the energy functional is bounded from below by @xmath21 hence any sequence @xmath22 such that @xmath23 corresponds to a microstructure that can only contain variants of martensite and thus can only exist if the volume does not change during transformation .",
    "if the transformation does involve a change in volume , i.e. @xmath24 , it is of interest to find the minimal value of the free energy @xmath25 .",
    "since the energy is proportional to the volume of the inclusion the relevant quantity is the macroscopic free energy density , i.e. the average energy per volume element , denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath1 is the free energy density of a region that has been macroscopically deformed by the identity map , i.e. that obeys the boundary condition @xmath13 .",
    "a characterisation ( see @xcite ) of @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 so that @xmath28 .",
    "in particular whenever @xmath29 there exists a deformation @xmath30 that is energetically preferable over the pure austenite .",
    "in the following we will always assume @xmath24 so that we can not have stress - free inclusions .",
    "the goal is to construct a test function @xmath31 such that the corresponding deformation @xmath30 has negative total free energy and is thus energetically preferable over the pure austenite corresponding to @xmath13 .",
    "we will explore two different approaches . in the first approach we only allow deviations from the austenite and we show that the geometry of the inclusion plays a crucial rle . in the second approach we only allow deviations from the martensite wells and use the principle of self - accommodation to derive our estimates .",
    "by @xcite it is known that a fine mixture of two rank - one connected martensitic variants can form a stress - free planar interface with the austenite .",
    "that is , there exists a rank - one matrix @xmath32 such that @xmath33 where @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we consider an inclusion with a core of pure martensite .",
    "since the volumes do not agree we have a transition layer where the deformation gradients can not be supported on the wells .",
    "we show that the energy penalty from the transition layer can be overcome by the gain in negative energy due to the presence of the martensite as long as the inclusion is flat and thin .",

    "we define the two regions as follows @xmath40 \\rbrace , \\ , \\omega_2:=\\lbrace x\\in \\mathbb{r}^3 | x_3 \\in ( \\varphi(r),\\sigma \\varphi(r ) ] \\rbrace,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "[ thsimple ] let @xmath0 be as in and assume the following upper bound on @xmath0 away from the austenite @xmath55 then the inclusion given by definition [ defellipsinc ] provides the following upper bound @xmath56 where @xmath57 .    in @xmath38 the gradients of @xmath31 are supported on the martensite wells and therefore @xmath58 . in @xmath48",
    "we estimate the energy using the upper bound on @xmath59 .",
    "we have @xmath60 with @xmath61 noting that @xmath62 is independent of @xmath50 and using the coarea formula ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) ) we arrive at @xmath63 where @xmath64 . combining the two estimates we obtain @xmath65 and thus for @xmath66 and since @xmath67 we have @xmath68 where @xmath57 .",

    "we note that we derived this upper bound by taking the limit @xmath70 and thus @xmath71 which corresponds to @xmath72 as the volume is fixed .",
    "thus within the class of inclusions under consideration the lowest energy is achieved by a very flat and thin inclusion .",
    "we can derive the same upper bound on @xmath1 by estimating @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the rank - one convex envelope of @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the proof uses the general result that @xmath75 and is simpler than the proof of theorem [ thsimple ] but gives no information on the structure of the inclusion .    under the same assumptions as in theorem [ thsimple ] an upper bound on @xmath73 and",

    "an upper bound on @xmath74 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  6.10 ) ) is in its simplest form given by @xmath78 the estimate can be refined by applying the same estimate to each of the terms @xmath79 on the rhs .",
    "we now decompose @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 . then by using and",
    "we have @xmath83 with @xmath77 .",
    "minimisation with respect to @xmath84 gives the desired estimate .",
    "in many materials @xmath85 , so that matrices in a relatively small neighbourhood of the martensite wells have unit determinant . allowing deviations from the martensite wells we now consider an inclusion with a core of variants that are close to the martensite wells and allow self - accommodation and thus do not require a transition layer .",
    "[ theoremupper ] let @xmath86 and let @xmath0 be as with @xmath87 for all @xmath88 such that @xmath89 .",

    ". by we have @xmath95 and thus using we can estimate @xmath96    we note that unlike theorem [ thsimple ] this construction is only preferable over the pure austenite for @xmath97 sufficiently large , corresponding to a temperature @xmath19 sufficiently far below the transition temperature @xmath98 , or for @xmath99 sufficiently close to @xmath100 .",
    "a comparison with the estimates in theorem [ thsimple ] reveals that provides a better bound than for small volume changes and a worse bound on @xmath1 for large volume changes . for @xmath101 we recover the case of self - accommodation , i.e. @xmath102    for simplicity",
    "the present paper only considered a cubic - to - tetragonal phase transformation .",
    "however , in the first part the only assumption on the material was the existence of an interface between a microstructure of martensite and austenite .",
    "in the second part , the only assumption on the material was that it almost satisfies a criterion of self - accommodation ( e.g. in a cubic - to- * transformation this holds iff @xmath103 , cf .",
    "thus as long as either or both assumptions are satisfied all respective conclusions remain the same .",
    "without making any a priori assumptions , apart from cylindrical symmetry , on the shape of an inclusion of martensite within austenite we have shown that - within the class of inclusions under consideration - the lowest energy is achieved for a flat and thin shape as observed in experiments .",
    "we showed that @xmath1 is always negative , so that within the model , it is always energetically preferable to nucleate martensite within austenite .",
    "further by comparing two different types of nucleation in theorem [ thsimple ] and theorem [ theoremupper ] we could show that for materials that almost fulfil the criteria for self - accommodation , i.e. @xmath104 , it is energetically preferable to form a self - accommodating inclusion rather than an inclusion with a core of a simple laminate .",
