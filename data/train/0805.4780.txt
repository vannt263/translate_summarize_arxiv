    "reaction rates of capture reactions are a crucial input to astrophysical network calculations .",
    "in particular , neutron capture reactions , which play a pivotal role in the astrophysical r - process nucleosynthesis , have to be known for nuclei between the valley of @xmath9-stability and the neutron - drip line ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "typically the neutron capture rates for the r - process have been estimated using the statistical hauser - feshbach model , although this may be unreliable away from stability as the level density is low . @xmath5 cross sections for short - lived unstable nuclei can not be measured experimentally and have to be taken from theory . however , the production of unstable nuclei close to the r - process path has become possible in the recent years , and neutron transfer experiments like @xmath1 on these nuclei are becoming more and more feasible as beam intensity continues to rise .",
    "experimental programs using such transfer reactions to derive @xmath5 rates ( i.e. @xcite ) have shown promising results .",
    "theoretical work is needed to place this indirect method on firmer grounds .",
    "capture reactions can occur directly or through a resonance .",
    "this work focuses on the direct capture only and analyzes for the first time @xmath1 and @xmath5 reactions simultaneously using the combination of spectroscopic factors ( sf ) and asymptotic normalization coefficients ( anc ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to charged particle capture which is mostly peripheral ( e.g. @xcite ) , neutron capture reactions may contain an important contribution from the nuclear interior and consequently be very sensitive to the spectroscopic factor of the final state @xcite .",
    "one nucleon sfs were first introduced into nuclear physics in the context of the shell model , where a sequence of orbitals is generated by a mean - field .",
    "sfs provide a measure of the occupancy of these orbitals @xcite .",
    "even with modern residual interactions , shell model predictions appear to overestimate sfs for well bound systems when compared to experimental values @xcite .",
    "the cause for this disagreement is still not well understood and work along these lines is ongoing .",
    "sfs on unstable nuclei are usually extracted through reactions such as transfer or knockout @xcite .",
    "transfer reactions have been traditionally the prime method of spectroscopy in nuclear physics ( see e.g.  the recent compilation of @xmath1 reactions @xcite ) . in the standard analysis ,",
    "the experimental cross section is compared with the predictions from the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite or the adiabatic distorted wave approximation ( adwa ) @xcite , and the sf is extracted from the normalization . at present , there is a large interest in @xmath1 reactions , be it as an indirect measure of @xmath5 rates , as a testing ground for many - body structure models , or directly associated with stockpile issues @xcite . in the conventional approach ,",
    "the extracted sfs suffer from large uncertainty due to the ambiguity in the bound state and optical potential parameters .",
    "as example we note the recently measured @xmath1 reactions on @xmath10 and @xmath11 nuclei in inverse kinematics , which have been used to determine the neutron sfs of @xmath12ge and @xmath13se above the closed neutron shell at @xmath14 .",
    "these sfs were used to calculate the direct @xmath0 capture cross sections on @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , the measured low - energy @xmath1 reactions are peripheral ; this leads to large uncertainties in the extracted sfs due to the ambiguity of the bound state potential parameters , which can deviate significantly from the standard ones for neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "for all these reasons , the methodology used when analysing @xmath1 data has been recently revisited and questioned @xcite . as dwba predictions",
    "are often the base for the extraction of the phenomenological sfs , sources of uncertainty in dwba calculations need to be under control .",
    "once one has ensured the validity of the one - step approximation @xcite , one needs to assess the uncertainty in the optical potentials @xcite and the bound state potential parameters @xcite .",
    "along these lines , a combined method of extracting sfs from transfer reactions , using the asymptotic normalization coefficients ( ancs ) determined independently , was suggested and tested for different nuclei @xcite . introducing the anc of the bound state in the formulation , one controls the normalization of the peripheral part of the reaction amplitude , generally a large contribution to the transfer cross section .",
    "this allows to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the choice of the bound state potential parameters and test the choice of the optical potential or the assumptions in dwba .",
    "these same ideas can also be applied to direct capture reactions , breakup , and @xmath15 .",
    "the ultimate goal of this work is to prove the principle that @xmath1 reactions can indeed be used to extract @xmath5 rate , through a systematic methodology . along these lines ,",
    "an important step to validate the use of @xmath1 reactions as an indirect tool to extract @xmath0 cross sections for exotic nuclei is to check for consistency between sfs extracted from @xmath1 reactions and those from @xmath0 on stable nuclei , when there is a large variety of data to constrain the problem .",
    "we therefore benchmark the @xmath1 method on @xmath16ca@xmath17ca ( ground state and first excited state ) .",
    "this choice is based on the very high quality data for thermal neutron capture , the well known neutron scattering length , and the number of @xmath1 data sets on @xmath16ca which all together present a stringent test for the applied reaction model",
    ". the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we provide some theoretical background and present the procedure used for extracting sfs from either @xmath1 or neutron capture . in section iii",
    "we include the details of the calculations and the data used , and present the results of our test case . finally , in section iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "in both @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the main nuclear structure input is the overlap function between the final state and the initial state @xmath20 , its norm being the sf .",
    "this many - body overlap function is usually approximated by a single particle state @xmath21 such that the many - body effects are hidden into the normalization factor : @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the neutron sf .",
    "we emphasize that eq.([overlap ] ) is an approximation , since the radial dependence of the overlap function and the nucleon bound state wave function can differ : the overlap function , as a many body object , includes , in addition to mean - field effects , the effects of residual interactions , which affect the nuclear surface region , the relevant region for direct reactions @xcite .",
    "the single - particle function @xmath21 is the solution of the schrdinger equation with a central potential , typically a woods - saxon potential of _ standard _ geometry .",
    "asymptotically , the many - body overlap function and the single - particle function do have the same radial behaviour . then , defining @xmath24 as the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the overlap function , and @xmath25 the single - particle asymptotic normalization coefficient , @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that , if one knew @xmath25 then knowing the anc @xmath24 would provide directly the sf @xmath23 .",
    "however , this is hardly ever the case .",
    "ambiguities in the single - particle parameters introduce ambiguities in the sf which are not well controlled @xcite .",
    "the dwba amplitude for the transfer reaction @xmath18 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the transition operator is written in post - form @xmath28 with @xmath29 the interaction potential between @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 the optical potential in the final - state .",
    "the distorted waves in the initial and final states are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the deuteron wavefunction .",
    "similarly , the reaction amplitude for the @xmath0 process in first order is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the well known electromagnetic transition operator , and @xmath38 is the neutron incoming scattering wave , usually calculated with the same potential that generates the final neutron bound state @xmath39 . the amplitude for @xmath5 is given in the usual first order approximation and the operator is taken in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "the @xmath18 dwba amplitude depends on the optical potentials in the initial and final states and the bound state potential , while the @xmath40 reaction depends only on the @xmath41 potential for the bound and scattering states . in either case , a phenomenological sf is typically extracted through normalizing the cross section to the corresponding data . as in @xcite , and for illustration purposes only , one can split the total amplitude into an asymptotic part @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 where the single - particle function already behaves as a hankel function , and the remaining interior part @xmath44 .",
    "the cross section is schematically given by @xmath45|^{2}= |s^{1/2}\\,{m}_{int}^{\\alpha}[b ]   + c\\,{\\tilde m}_{ext}^{\\alpha}|^{2 } , \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 stands for @xmath1 or @xmath0 .",
    "here we express the dependence on the single particle parameters @xmath47 by the single - particle anc @xmath48 .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) brings out important intuitive physics : the normalization of the external part of the reaction amplitude is governed by the anc while the internal part is determined by the sf .",
    "if a reaction is completely peripheral , it is possible to extract the anc from the normalization to the data without any single - particle ambiguity ( i.e. , no dependence on @xmath25 ) . in general , there are contributions from both the internal and external region and it becomes important to fix the external part independently for an accurate determination of the sf .",
    "this is true for transfer and capture reactions .",
    "it is generally said that transfer reactions are surface peaked , however the internal / external relative contributions can change significantly with energy . for sub - coulomb transfer reactions ,",
    "one is only sensitive to the asymptotic part of the neutron wavefunction , and the anc can be extracted virtually without theoretical uncertainties . in @xcite ,",
    "the important realization was that , introducing this independent anc into the formulation , one could then extract a sf from a transfer reaction at higher energy , reducing significantly the uncertainty from the single - particle parameters .",
    "direct radiative capture @xmath0 can be mostly peripheral if there is a centrifugal barrier in the initial state ( e.g. @xmath49c@xmath50c @xcite ) .",
    "however if there is no barrier at all ( @xmath51wave neutron capture ) , the interior contribution is important . at typical stellar energies of 10 - 300 kev , @xmath51wave and @xmath52wave",
    "capture cross sections are often comparable , see e.g.@xcite , so both the anc and the sf are important ingredients to calculate the @xmath5 cross section . in this work",
    "we will analyse , en par , @xmath1 reactions at several beam energies and the corresponding capture reaction on @xmath16ca . by varying the single - particle radius within a reasonable interval and fixing the diffuseness",
    ", we generate a set of single - particle functions for a range of single - particle ancs . for each of these",
    ", we calculate the @xmath1 and @xmath5 cross sections . normalizing the peak of the @xmath1 angular distribution to the data at each energy , and normalizing the thermal neutron capture total cross section , we calculate phenomenological sfs .",
    "we choose @xmath1 at sub - coulomb energies , where the reaction is known to be peripheral , and normalize the theoretical cross section to the backward peak in the data .",
    "we include @xmath1 at higher energies and normalize the theory to the first forward peak in the data . in this way we obtain a function @xmath53 from each deuteron energy considered .",
    "we also extract @xmath54 from the thermal capture .",
    "these @xmath55 functions obviously vary differently with the single - particle anc @xmath25 .",
    "if there is consistency in the formulations , they should all intersect for a realistic @xmath56 .",
    "this procedure is better illustrated by looking at the ancs @xmath57 ^ 2 = s_{exp}^{dp}(b ) \\",
    ", b^2 \\,\\,\\ , { \\rm{and } } \\,\\,\\ ,   [ c_{exp}^{n\\gamma}(b)]^2=s_{exp}^{n\\gamma}(b ) \\ , b^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : sf_anc}\\ ] ] if the reaction is completely peripheral , @xmath58 is constant .",
    "if there is contribution from the interior , then @xmath58 has a slope .",
    "this slope will be more pronounced the larger the interior contribution .",
    "our test case is @xmath59 , which is part of the r - process chart @xcite and believed to be composed of the double magic @xmath16ca core and a neutron single particle state , either @xmath60 for the @xmath7ca ground state , or @xmath61 for the first excited state in @xmath7ca .",
    "direct capture is dominant for @xmath16ca@xmath17ca because of the small reaction q - value and the low level density ( see fig . 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "these properties of the stable neutron - rich @xmath16ca are close to the expected properties of nuclei close to the r - process path . for @xmath16ca ,",
    "direct neutron capture occurs via @xmath51wave @xcite and has a significant contribution from the nuclear interior .",
    "therefore it is an ideal test case since the result should be very sensitive to the anc , but also to the sf .",
    "another advantage of this choice is that the scattering length for @xmath62 has been measured with sufficient accuracy @xmath63 fm @xcite which allows to determine the initial scattering potential @xmath41 with very minor uncertainties @xcite .",
    "neutron radiative capture on @xmath64 @xcite and transfer @xmath65 @xcite have been accurately measured at several beam energies , for both the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "thermal @xmath5 data at 25 mev @xcite were measured with @xmath66% accuracy , and sub - coulomb @xmath1 at 1.992 mev @xcite was measured with @xmath67% accuracy . in this work we also use @xmath1 data at 13 mev and 19.3 mev from @xcite and at 56 mev from @xcite .",
    "neutron capture e1 cross sections are determined for the set of bound state wavefunctions corresponding to the single - particle radius within the range @xmath68 fm and fixed diffuseness @xmath69 fm , with the woods - saxon depth @xmath70 adjusted to reproduce the correct binding energy of the final states in @xmath7ca .",
    "the depth @xmath70 for the initial distorted wave is fixed to reproduce the @xmath71 scattering length @xcite . for the transfer calculations , following the procedure in @xcite , we use the perey - perey global optical potential @xcite to define the optical potential in the exit channel and construct the deuteron potential in the entrance channel using adwa @xcite , for all but the sub - coulomb reaction ( for the 1.99 mev @xmath1 calculations , we use the optical potentials presented in @xcite although results are not sensitive to this choice ",
    "e.g.  a variation of the potential depth by 10% changes the reaction cross section by only about 1% ) .",
    "adwa includes deuteron breakup and thus goes well beyond one - step dwba .",
    "the @xmath72ca and @xmath73ca potentials , needed to construct the finite range adiabatic deuteron potential @xcite , are also taken from @xcite .",
    "adwa is developed for reactions where the remnant @xmath74 can be neglected .",
    "we have checked that this is the case for @xmath16ca@xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath75 we use the reid - soft - core @xcite although a simple gaussian provides the same results . for the deuteron bound state we use @xcite and for @xmath7ca , the same set of bound state wavefunctions used for the @xmath5 calculations .",
    "all calculations are performed using fresco @xcite .",
    "the shape of the angular distribution at 56 mev @xcite , in particular in the forward angle region where it is most important , was not reproduced ( this was also the finding in @xcite ) .",
    "for that reason , instead of the perey and perey parameterization , we used the koning and delaroche @xcite with which a significant improvement was obtained for the ground state .",
    "calculated adwa angular distributions are compared to the data in fig.[fig_dpang ] .",
    "results for the @xmath7ca ground state are shown in fig.[fig_spfgrst1 ] and fig.[fig_ancgrst1 ] for @xmath55 and @xmath76 respectively . as expected , the sub - coulomb @xmath1 reaction is totally peripheral . at @xmath77 mev , the reaction is below the coulomb barrier ( @xmath78 mev ) both in the initial and final channels ( q - value is @xmath79 mev ) .",
    "@xmath76 remains constant over the broad interval of @xmath25 : @xmath80 @xmath81 for the @xmath82 , see fig.[fig_ancgrst1 ] .",
    "consequently the sf behaves as @xmath83 as illustrated in fig.[fig_spfgrst1 ] .",
    "the extracted anc is insensitive to the optical and bound state potential parameters , the error bar coming from the systematic error of the data alone . at @xmath84 and @xmath85 mev",
    ", the @xmath1 reaction turns out to be also dominantly peripheral .",
    "it is reassuring that the @xmath86 extracted at these energies @xcite are consistent with the sub - coulomb result , corroborating the adwa at these energies .",
    "however , we should note that , contrary to the @xmath87 mev case , these cross sections are sensitive to the choice of the optical potentials .",
    "the lack of @xmath25 dependence makes it impossible to determine the sf from the @xmath88 and @xmath85 mev data . increasing the beam energy changes the picture .",
    "fig.[fig_ancgrst1 ] shows clearly that the 56 mev data has a larger contribution from the interior and thus is more sensitive to the single particle parameters .",
    "expectedly , as the single particle anc increases , so does the external contribution , which explains the flattening of the @xmath89 curve from the @xmath4 mev ( d , p ) data .",
    "the error band is represented by the long - dashed lines in figs.[fig_spfgrst1 ] and [ fig_ancgrst1 ] .",
    "the cross sections at this energy were measured with @xmath67% accuracy but we have added in quadrature another @xmath67% due to the dependence on the optical potentials . from the joint analysis of the 2 mev data and the 56 mev data , we can extract a spectroscopic factor @xmath90 .",
    "the results for the anc extracted from @xmath91 show a strong @xmath25 dependence , in perfect agreement with @xcite , confirming an important contribution from the nuclear interior . from the overlapping regions in fig.[fig_ancgrst1 ] , we obtain @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 , in agreement with the value obtained from the @xmath4 mev transfer data .",
    "this @xmath95 @xmath93 corresponds to @xmath96 fm , a radius larger than the standard value .",
    "the determined sf is lower than one could expect from the independent particle shell model , confirming the reduction of the sf previously seen @xcite , and now the ambiguity of the bound state potential parameters has been eliminated .",
    "one may ask whether there are deuteron energies @xmath97 ( mev ) for which the @xmath1 cross sections show the same sensitivity to the nuclear interior as the corresponding @xmath5 .",
    "we find that @xmath98 mev provides an excellent match .",
    "adwa is expected to perform well in this energy region , as the adiabatic condition is satisfied ( see @xcite for a successful application on @xmath99c ) .",
    "we thus consider the @xmath1 reaction at @xmath98 mev and apply an arbitrary normalization to the cross section ( open circles in fig.[fig_spfgrst1 ] and fig.[fig_ancgrst1 ] ) . clearly illustrated in fig.[fig_ancgrst1 ]",
    ", @xmath76 obtained from the @xmath1 reaction at @xmath8 mev has a similar @xmath25 dependence as the @xmath76 from the @xmath0 process .",
    "we emphasize that a @xmath1 experiment on @xmath16ca at this energy would be very useful ; plans for such an experiment have been initiated by the present study @xcite .",
    "we also study the @xmath1 and @xmath0 reactions to the first excited state in @xmath100 .",
    "results for @xmath55 and @xmath76 show the same pattern as for the ground state .",
    "because of the relation between anc and sf we show only @xmath76 in fig.[fig_ancexst1 ] .",
    "we obtain from sub - coulomb @xmath1 reaction , @xmath101 @xmath81 .",
    "reactions at 13 and 19 mev remain peripheral and the @xmath4 mev distribution is not well described by our model . again , the @xmath1 at 30 mev and the @xmath0 show a similar sensitivity to the interior as for the ground state transition .",
    "our sub - coulomb @xmath1 and @xmath0 joint analysis provides @xmath102 @xmath93 and @xmath103 .",
    "again , this @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath96 fm , showing consistency in the geometry of the neutron @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals .",
    "the large radii @xmath104 give further evidence for a neutron skin in neutron - rich calcium isotopes @xcite .",
    "our goal was to provide a proof of principle that @xmath1 reactions can indeed be used to extract @xmath5 rates , through a systematic methodology . as sub - coulomb or near - coulomb - barrier @xmath1 reactions are peripheral",
    ", they provide an anc virtually free from optical potential ambiguities .",
    "whenever the @xmath105 reaction is peripheral , this is the only necessary bound state information needed for calculating the neutron capture cross section at low energy .",
    "if the @xmath0 is not peripheral , one needs to know both , the anc and the sf .",
    "we have shown for @xmath16ca that sfs obtained from thermal capture and @xmath4 mev ( d , p ) are consistent .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath1 data at energies around @xmath98 mev has a similar interior contribution as the @xmath5 and could thus be a better tool for extracting the @xmath5 cross sections . in order to confirm this , experiments at 30 mev providing cross sections with better than @xmath67% accuracy",
    ", would be very useful .",
    "any prediction of neutron capture cross sections on unstable nuclei will be complicated by the fact that the neutron scattering length will not be measurable in most cases .",
    "this leads to an additional uncertainty because the scattering potential is not as well - defined as for the presented example @xmath106 . a rough estimate",
    "( see e.g.  fig .  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows that this additional uncertainty remains below a factor of two for realistic variations of the neutron scattering potential .",
    "a detailed study of uncertainties of neutron capture cross sections for unstable nuclei will be given in a forthcoming paper .    from this work",
    ", we also find that @xmath51wave @xmath0 reactions are actually very well suited for extracting a sf . for the @xmath105 process ,",
    "the transition operator is well known , the ambiguity in the optical potential at very low energies is negligible when imposing the correct neutron scattering length , and the ambiguity of the bound state potential parameters is greatly reduced by fixing the asymptotic part of the bound state , say through sub - coulomb reactions .",
    "hence , the joint analysis of low energy @xmath1 and thermal @xmath51wave @xmath5 provides a powerful method to test microscopic structure models .",
