    "surface plasmon polaritons ( spps)@xcite are considered ideal for circuitry miniaturization to nanoscale dimensions@xcite , due to their inherent surface - bound and spatial confinement characteristics .",
    "this makes them appealing for various applications , such as nanoscopic signal processing@xcite and high resolution sensing@xcite .",
    "however , considering the fs temporal and nm spatial scales involved , direct real space characterization of evanescent waves presents a significant experimental challenge , especially in materials and devices involving buried interfaces and complex heterostructures.several optics - based approaches have been developed to meet the challenge of tracking surface - bound spps with appropriate resolution , notably dual - color coherent anti - stokes raman scattering ( cars)@xcite and scanning tip based techniques such as near - field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom ) @xcite . in recent years , the spatial and temporal resolution limits of these optical techniques have been pushed to the 10s of nm and 100s of fs @xcite . in an alternative approach ,",
    "the use of electron photoemission for detection , as in time - resolved nonlinear photoemission electron microscopy ( tr peem)@xcite , has allowed for comparable spatial resolution in imaging spps , with time resolution extending down to the few - fs single optical cycle regime .",
    "recent advances in tr - peem methods have facilitated the successful spatiotemporal mapping of localized and propagating surface plasmons in a variety of systems@xcite .",
    "however , as tr - peem relies on sample - emitted photoelectrons , and scanning - tip - based techniques require physical probe proximity to the evanescent field , both are inherently limited to the study of exposed material surfaces . furthermore , the connection between the probed field and the local density of photonics states is not always direct@xcite . due to these restrictions ,",
    "these techniques are not suited for studies of advanced multilayer systems and heterostructured devices that rely on plasmonic waves bound to buried interfaces.an alternative method to those mentioned above employs electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) in a transmission electron microscope@xcite , either in a spectrum imaging ( spim ) or energy - filtered transmission electron microscopy ( eftem ) configuration , enabling @xmath1 1 nm spatial resolution in the imaging of spps in thin films and nanostructures@xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "plasmonic guided modes are excited by the transient electric field generated by the fast ( 80 - 300 kev ) electrons traversing the specimen@xcite . in its most widespread spim implementation , eels is combined with an electron beam raster scanning approach , offering temporal imaging resolution down to the millisecond ( camera - rate ) range .",
    "recently however , a new technique termed photon - induced near - field electron microscopy ( pinem)@xcite extended the accessible domain of eels - based experiments to the nm / fs regime by optically exciting spps with intense fs laser pulses , and subsequently probing the resulting plasmonic near - fields through their interaction with ultrafast electron bunches@xcite . by creating an image using only the electrons that have gained energy through the inelastic scattering from plasmons , pinem performed in the eftem configuration enables direct field - of - view imaging of photoexcited plasmonic fields in a transmission geometry@xcite .",
    "compared to cars , nsom , and tr - peem , the pinem technique offers several major advantages : _",
    "i ) _ it allows experimental access to otherwise `` hidden '' plasmonic fields at interfaces buried beneath the surface of advanced multilayer designs ; _ ii ) _ it uses a noninvasive probe that does not strongly affect the plasmons being measured ; and _ iii ) _ it couples exclusively to the evanescent component of the electromagnetic field at the sample , avoiding incident or reflected beam signal contributions and enabling a direct image interpretation .",
    "these advantages , along with the convenient ability to obtain complementary nanoscale morphological , structural and chemical information through static or time - resolved tem imaging , electron diffraction and eels in the same setup , make pinem uniquely suited for probing plasmonics in more complex geometries and advanced multilayer systems . in recent years",
    ", pinem has been used to image optical near - fields at the surfaces of a variety of materials , nanostructures and biological specimens@xcite , although these efforts did not track the dynamical behavior of the photoinduced plasmons or target the material properties of the specimens .",
    "so far , the use of pinem to experimentally access spp dynamics has remained an open challenge due to the typical spp lifetime ( on the order of 100 fs ) being beyond instrumental temporal resolution ( to date at best @xmath1 500 fs using single optical pulses@xcite , extendable down to @xmath1 210 fs through photon gating@xcite ) , with the latter being primarily limited by the electron bunch duration@xcite.in this work we employ localized , embedded spp sources to launch spps in a 2d plasmonic waveguide , provided by a buried ag/ interface , allowing the photoinduced plasmons to propagate and interfere over several microns . in this geometry ,",
    "the electron - plasmon scattering observed at different distances from the spp sources occurs at different times due to the finite time delay needed for spp propagation . by visualizing and characterizing this temporal dependence using time - resolved pinem imaging , we could film the dynamical evolution of the collective plasmonic field propagating at a buried interface with combined ultrafast and nanoscale resolution .     * time - resolved pinem methodology . *",
    "* ( a ) * simplified scheme of the time - resolved pinem experiments in this work . a photon pump pulse incident on a nanopatterned ag - on- bilayer structure generates an spp wave propagating along the buried ag/ interface .",
    "the near - field of the propagating spp is subsequently probed through its interaction with a field - of - view electron pulse at a time - delay @xmath2 .",
    "energy - filtered imaging of the resulting electron distribution of transmitted electrons then provides spatially - resolved temporal snapshots of the near - field corresponding to the propagating plasmonic wave . *",
    "( b ) * variation of the relative time delay between the optical excitation pulse and the probing electron pulse generates a time - resolved movie of the ultrafast evolution of the buried plasmonic near - field.,width=453 ]",
    "a conceptual scheme of our experiment is sketched in fig .",
    "a linearly polarized optical pump pulse is incident on a nanocavity in a -supported ag thin film , launching spps of energy @xmath3 = @xmath4 that are confined to the ag/ interface . at a variable time delay @xmath2 , the propagating plasmonic wave",
    "is then probed by a spatially dispersed pulse of fast electrons , which inelastically scatter from the optically excited spps .",
    "this scattering interaction results in the electrons gaining and losing integer numbers of spp energy quanta@xcite , yielding equidistantly spaced peaks in the energy distribution of the transmitted electrons . by subsequently constructing an energy - filtered image using only those electrons that have gained energy , one directly obtains a spatially - resolved snapshot of the @xmath5 component of the buried plasmonic near - field@xcite . due to the large field - of - view of the electron beam employed here , snapshots recorded at different relative time delays @xmath2 thus capture the spatiotemporal evolution of the photoinduced plasmonic wave ( see fig .",
    "1b).the sample studied in this work consists of a 30 nm ag thin film deposited on a 50 nm membrane .",
    "a variety of different rectangular nanocavity ( nc ) arrays were patterned into the ag film using focused ion beam milling ( see methods and supplementary figure 1 ) . in order to experimentally measure the propagation speed of spps at the buried interface , we monitor a large , featureless area adjacent to a linear array of ncs , as sketched in fig",
    ". 2a . the optical pump beam ( @xmath6 @xmath0 , @xmath7 = 786 nm , full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) duration @xmath1 105 fs ) and the photoelectron probe beam ( @xmath6 @xmath0 40 ) , @xmath8 = 200 kev , fwhm duration @xmath1 650 fs ) are spatially overlapped at near - normal incidence on the ag side of the nanopatterned bilayer sample .",
    "the optical pump pulses generate spps at the edges of the ncs , with each edge coupling to the incident electric field component along the in - plane edge normal@xcite .",
    "since the ncs fully perforate the metal film , photoexcited spps are transmitted through the ncs to the other side of the ag layer and subsequently launched across the ag/ interface@xcite . in first approximation ,",
    "each nc edge thus effectively acts as a source of spps that travel radially outward in a point dipole - like pattern at the buried interface@xcite .",
    "consequently , according to the huygens - fresnel principle , the interferometric plasmonic wave propagating away from the nc array ( along the y - axis in fig .",
    "2a ) corresponds to the coherent superposition of the spps launched from the different ncs.figure 2b shows the experimental pinem image of the resulting plasmonic interference pattern ( pip ) , recorded at a zero relative delay time @xmath2 between the optical pump and electron probe pulse maxima .",
    "the spatial fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the entire frame in fig .",
    "2b gives direct access to the spatial frequencies present in the interference pattern@xcite , and its radial integral is singularly peaked at the spatial period corresponding to the wavelength of the optically driven spp wave ( fig . 2c ) .",
    "we can thus directly extract the spp wavelength @xmath9 and wavevector @xmath10 as 633 @xmath11 13 nm and 9.94 @xmath11 0.20 @xmath12m@xmath13 , respectively , where the errors are due to the uncertainty in the calibration of the pinem image ( see methods ) .",
    "figure 2d depicts the calculated electron energy loss probability for 200 kev electrons transmitted through a model of our layered sample ( 30 nm ag on 50 nm ) , plotted as a function of energy loss and momentum transfer normal to the beam direction . given the known energy of the optically driven spps in the measurements ( @xmath3 = @xmath14 = 1.58 @xmath11 0.015 ev ) , we find that the experimentally obtained spp characteristics match well with the theoretical dispersion of the plasmonic mode propagating at the buried interface ( see supplementary figure 2).since pinem is an ultrafast field - of - view technique , it can track the evolution of the photoexcited plasmonic wave in time , given a sufficient combined spatiotemporal resolution . here we can follow its evolution and build - up as it propagates away from the linear nc array upon photoexcitation by performing a slice analysis of the pinem images obtained at different time delays @xmath2 . as sketched in figure 3a , we divide up the image in a series of horizontal slices centered at different distances @xmath15 from the nc array . by taking the spatial fft of these slices for each delay , and integrating the fourier features corresponding to the spp interference",
    ", we can track the propagation of the plasmonic wavefront in time , as is sketched for a number of discrete slices in fig .",
    "these time traces correspond to the sub - ps cross - correlation of the electron probe and the photoexcited spp pulse in the different discrete @xmath15-ranges in the sample , offset by a temporal difference @xmath16 due to the spp wave propagation .",

    "this value is consistent with that expected from theory for the buried spp mode , as indicated in figure 2d .",

    "the ability of pinem to directly access plasmonic interference patterns opens up a multitude of possibilities for creating arbitrarily shaped plasmonic transient gratings , as the obtained interferometric structures can be precisely tailored by combining appropriately arranged nanoscale features with suitable photoexcitation@xcite .",
    "moreover , experiments can be supported by simulations applying maxwell s equations to the nanopattern architectures , providing effective feedback and enabling the predictive design of transient pips .",
    "figure 4 illustrates this flexibility in designing transient pips .",
    "panels a and b show the pinem image of a linear array of long ncs under photoexcitation using different linear polarization orientations , demonstrating that it is indeed possible to obtain transient plasmonic gratings using relatively simple nanostructures .",
    "more complex interference patterns can be generated away from such linear nc arrays , as shown for example for an array formed by short ncs ( fig .",
    "one particularly interesting feature of an spp wave propagating away from a periodic source array is the plasmon talbot effect , in which the source configuration is self - imaged into an array of plasmon focal spots at characteristic propagation distances@xcite .",
    "this is predicted to occur even outside the paraxial regime , and upon close inspection its signature can indeed be seen in figure 2b at @xmath26 , corresponding to the half - period shifted revival at half the so - called talbot distance . by combining two linear nc arrays with an appropriate relative positioning and photoexcitation",
    "one can exploit this effect even at shorter propagation distances , allowing for the generation of multiple closely spaced arrays of nanoscale focal spots of near - field intensity , and thus charge density , at the buried interface ( see fig .",
    "4d ) . here",
    "the pip is dominated by the interference of counter - propagating spps generated at the different arrays , such that its @xmath27/2 periodicity along the propagation axis yields @xmath9 = 638 @xmath11 32 nm , which is consistent with the value extracted in figure 2 .",
    "given the thin metal layer and relatively narrow ncs , the influence of multiple scattering and reflections of the spps on the structure of the resulting standing wave pattern is small , such that a simple analytical model based on a double array of point dipole spp sources can reproduce the major features observed ( see supplementary figure 3 ) .",
    "by contrast , this model does not capture the observed complex interference of co - propagating spps ( as in the propagation experiment ) . in this case , the time - averaged interference between spps from the different point - dipole sources is weaker ( similar to that in the plasmon talbot effect ) , and additional experimental factors such as non - uniform time - averaging ( due to the optical pulse envelope ) , finite bandwidth excitation and multiple order pinem scattering are expected to play a dominant role.as shown in fig .",
    "4a - b , the shape of the transient spp grating generated by the linear array of long ncs is strongly dependent on the excitation polarization .",
    "figure 5 analyzes the indicated region in more detail . in particular , we show in fig . 5a",
    "that upon photoexcitation using light polarized perpendicular to the nc long axis , the counterpropagating spps between the ncs set up a transient plasmonic grating with a period corresponding to half the spp wavelength .",
    "this yields another independent determination of the spp carrier wavelength ( @xmath9 = 639 @xmath11 6 nm ) , in good agreement with both previously extracted values and the calculated dispersion for the spp mode propagating at the interface .",
    "interestingly , varying the polarization angle of the incident light dramatically changes the relative intensities of the near - field grating fringes . at a polarization angle of @xmath28 , two of the grating fringes are almost completely suppressed , such that the periodicity of the plasmonic grating has effectively doubled .",
    "this is further illustrated in figs .",
    "5b and c , which depict the full polarization dependence of the transient plasmonic grating .",
    "panel b plots the fringe contrast @xmath29 , calculated as @xmath30/@xmath31 , for each of the four fringes indicated in fig .",

    "the materials ( ag and ) are represented through their dielectric functions , taken from tabulated measured data ( refs . and",
    ", respectively).an approximate plasmonic interference pattern for the nanostructure imaged in figure 4d was analytically calculated based on arrays of simple point dipole spp sources ( see supplementary figure 3 ) .",
    "the model takes into account the finite propagation distance @xmath53 @xmath54 , defined as the @xmath55 decay distance of the plasmon electric field , calculated from the tabulated permittivities for spps at a ag/ interface ( semi - infinite slabs ) at the photon energy under consideration .",
    "this value is consistent with the experimental observations in this work , which show little spatial plasmonic field decay within the field of view .",
    "all sources were assumed to be monochromatic ( @xmath27 = 638 nm ) , radiating spp waves travelling radially outward in a dipolar pattern .",
    "all dipoles were oriented along the same direction ( maximum radiated field along @xmath40 , with the point dipole oscillating along the perpendicular direction , i.e. @xmath56 ) .",
    "the resulting complex @xmath57-field components originating from the different sources were coherently summed , after which uniform time - averaging was incorporated by taking the square modulus of the sum .",
