    "following the discovery of the higgs boson , one of the main tasks of a future linear @xmath1collider will be precise model - independent measurements of its fundamental couplings to fermions and bosons and its total width @xcite .",
    "in particular , the determination of the couplings of the higgs boson to the other fundamental particles will be a crucial test of the nature of the higgs particle . in this respect",
    "future linear colliders will play a major role .",
    "different colliding options with different beam polarisations combined with adjustable center - of - mass energies in a wide range and the clean enviroment in these machines will allow for rather precise determinations of these couplings .    a lot of detailed studies of the standard model ( sm ) higgs couplings to fermions and @xmath11 and @xmath6 bosons can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrate the ability of a linear collider to access these couplings with precision of a few percent .",
    "also the trilinear higgs self - coupling in the double higgs production processes @xmath1@xmath12 and @xmath1@xmath13 @xcite are within the possibilities of experimental verification , although with substantially lower precision .",
    "another set of important higgs boson couplings is represented by the effective vertices @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these couplings do not occur at the tree - level but are induced by loop diagrams @xcite . since the higgs interaction is proportional to particle masses , loop contributions of massive fermions do not decouple , and these vertices could therefore serve to count the number of particles which couple to the higgs boson .",
    "the @xmath14 vertex can be accessed through the @xmath17 decay in @xmath1collisions @xcite or in the fusion reaction @xmath18 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 coupling can be determined either in @xmath1and lhc-@xmath19 interactions when the higgs decays into two photons @xcite,@xcite or directly by means of the compton back - scattering @xmath20fusion process @xmath20@xmath21 , with probably the best precision @xcite .    in this study",
    "we explore the potential of a linear @xmath1collider to measure the @xmath16 coupling through the rare @xmath8decay , for masses of the higgs particle in the range 120 to 160 gev .",
    "precise electroweak data provide the existence of a light higgs boson with a mass below 193 gev with 95% confidence level @xcite , with a preference for @xmath9 close to 120 gev .",
    "there are also hints of a signal in the direct search in @xmath1@xmath22 at lep2 , with a lower mass limit of @xmath23 114.1 gev at 95% cl @xcite .",
    "the reaction which will be used to explore the branching fraction bf(@xmath8 ) is @xmath24 assuming a higgs boson mass @xmath9 = 120 , 140 and 160 gev , @xmath25 = 500 gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath26 = 1 ab@xmath2",
    ".    the statistical precision for bf(@xmath8 ) is mainly determined by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the number of signal and background events within a small interval of the @xmath30 invariant mass , centered around @xmath9 .",
    "hence , evaluation of all relevant signal and background processes and optimization of selection procedures are mandatory , taking into account acceptances and resolutions of a linear collider detector .",
    "our analysis is , to our knowledge , the first on the study of bf(@xmath8 ) at any ( future ) collider .",
    "it includes the complete irreducible background and all main reducible background contributions expected .",
    "since the sm branching fraction @xmath8is very small and there is in particular large irreducible background , the most important hadronic z decays , @xmath31 , are accounted for in this analysis .",
    "although leptonic ( e , @xmath32 ) @xmath6 decays provide a clean final state signature and best @xmath6 boson recognition , their rates are however too small to include them at this stage of the analysis or to allow for an independent approach .",
    "@xmath33 decays are not considered since they prevent @xmath6 boson reconstruction in reaction ( 1 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we discuss simulation of the higgs signal and background events and their detector response . in section  3",
    "we present the results for unpolarised bf(@xmath8 ) measurements , using different selection procedures . in section  4",
    "improvements to the @xmath8branching fraction measurements are discussed when e.g. beam polarisation is accounted for in signal and background events .",
    "also , expectations on bf(@xmath8 ) from the higgs - strahlung process and possible systematic errors and the effect of overlap with @xmath34 are reviewed .",
    "section  5 summarizes the conclusions .",
    "in @xmath35 collisions the standard model higgs boson is predominantly produced by two different processes , the higgs - strahlung process @xmath36 and the weak boson ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) fusion reactions + @xmath39",
    "@xmath40    the @xmath38 fusion process ( 4 ) is strongly suppressed with respect to the @xmath37 fusion process ( 3 ) by about a factor of 10 , rather independent of @xmath25 . therefore , the production channel ( 4 ) is ignored in this study .",
    "the sm tree - level diagrams contributing to the signal reactions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , including the @xmath41 and @xmath8decays , are shown in fig .  1 .    in the @xmath42 approximation the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    "are factorizable parts of the higgs signal diagrams for the 2-to-4 body reaction ( 1 ) with electron neutrinos in the final state . in other words ,",
    "the amplitude squared of diagram 1 in fig .",
    "1 integrated over the phase space gives @xmath43(@xmath1@xmath44 and the amplitudes squared of diagrams 2 and 3 give @xmath45 . thus , to be most general in our analysis , events of reaction ( 1 ) were generated for the complete set of tree - level diagrams ( see fig .  2 for the contributing background diagrams ) by means of the program package comphep @xcite , including initial state bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung for the tesla linear collider option @xcite .",
    ".,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    the present version of comphep performs analytic calculations of the matrix element squared , generates an optimized fortran code and generates a flow of events .",
    "in addition , it provides for the user an appropriate kinematical scheme for the integration over the four - body phase space .",
    "the basic input parameters are taken from the report of the particle data group @xcite or are as listed here : @xmath46 = 4.3 gev , @xmath47 = 1/128 , @xmath48 = 91.19 gev , @xmath49 = 0.23 and @xmath50 = 2.50 gev .",
    "the comphep - pythia interface package @xcite was used to simulate the @xmath51 signature . in this way , higgs boson production and the complete irreducible background as well as possible interferences are taken into account .    for unstable particles ,",
    "breit - wigner formulae have been used for the s - channel propagators . the higgs boson width and",
    "the @xmath8branching fraction were imported from the program package hdecay @xcite .",
    "bf(@xmath8 ) depends on the higgs mass and is largest near @xmath9 = 144 gev . some values of this branching fraction , the total higgs width and the @xmath16 effective coupling constant relevant for our study are summarized in table 1 .

    "the results attainable for the relative uncertainties of the @xmath8branching fraction are 48% ( 27% , 44% ) for @xmath9 = 120 ( 140 , 160 ) gev .",
    "we regard these numbers as rather encouraging , especially considering the initial value of the s / b rates .",
    "although a complete optimization for neither selection technique has not been achieved , we are confident that room for improved @xmath8branching fraction measurements is limited , mainly due to the presence of overwhelming irreducible background with final state signature similar to the signal events . improvements may rely on the size of the higgs window not yet adjusted to obtain optimized numbers of signal to background events for a narrow gaussian resonance whose observed width is dominated by instrumental effects . also higgs - strahlung events which exist in the data sample at 500 gev",
    "would provide an independent @xmath8branching fraction , based on however different selection procedures .",
    "although a less accurate measurement is anticipated ( due to larger @xmath1@xmath56 irreducible background and more complicated analyses when both z bosons decay hadronically ) , but in combination with the @xmath4 fusion measurement an improved @xmath10b(@xmath8)/b(@xmath8 ) of about 10% can be expected .",
    "furthermore , inclusion of leptonic @xmath6 boson decays and @xmath57 fusion events of reaction ( 4 ) , so far neglected , would slightly improve the results .",
    "however , the increase of the signal event sample of about 10 to 20% would be partially compensated by more background which scales in approximatelly the same way .",
    "an alternative approach relies on studying the higgs - strahlung process @xmath58 at optimezed lower energies , e.g. at @xmath25 = 300 gev . here",
    ", approximately 95% of all z decays are useful and for @xmath26 = 1 ab@xmath2 about 200 @xmath59 events are expected . assuming similar selection efficiencies as found for the @xmath4 fusion process , the final @xmath8sample would consist of some 50 events , of which approximately 50% are 4-jet events with a prompt photon .",
    "a topology of four jets with an accompaning photon is not only produced by @xmath8@xmath60 decays , but also via fragmentation of quarks and gluons of continuum @xmath57 production . refering also to the huge irreducible @xmath61 background and the large cross - section process @xmath62 with initial and final state photon radiation ,",
    "detailed analyses are needed and preliminary results indicate less precision on bf(@xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "linear @xmath1colliders offer the possibility for longitudinal polarised electron and positron beams , with varying polarisation degrees in right - handed or left - handed modes .",
    "higgs boson production rates in both processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) depends strongly on the polarisation degree and the helicity of the incoming particles .",
    "for any given process , ratios of the cross - section for given electron and positron beam polarisations divided by the cross - section for unpolarised beams , denoted as @xmath63 , are presented in table 2 of @xcite for different beam polarisations .",
    "the higgs event rates in processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are enhanced most for left - handed @xmath64 colliding with right - handed @xmath65 with as large a degree of polarisation as possible . for the feasible though ambitious case of collisions between an @xmath64 beam with polarisation @xmath66 = -0.8 and an @xmath65 beam with polarisation @xmath67 = + 0.6 , @xmath63 = 1.77 and 2.88 for the higgs - strahlung and @xmath4 fusion processses , respectively .",
    "however , the dominant irreducible background in both processes scales in approximately the same way with beam polarisations as the signal processes @xcite , the precision of the @xmath8branching fraction improves by only a factor @xmath68 . under such circumstances , the relative uncertaities on bf(@xmath8 ) is lowered to 28% ( 16% , 26% ) for @xmath9 = 120 ( 140 , 160 ) gev , if the `` higgs - likeness '' selection technique is exploited .",
    "however , it should be noted that other physics processes will demand different beam polarisations and the assumption of using the full luminosity with the desired beam polarisation for this particular measurement gives some lower bound to the attainable precision .",
    "since the signal - to - background ratio is expected to be less than unity , it should be emphasized that large continuum @xmath30 production and copious @xmath69 background events must be rejected by excellent geometrical resolution and stringent isolation criteria combined with excellent electromagnetic and hadronic energy resolution and hermiticity . a worse resolution would flatten the marginal signal events over large @xmath30 background , thus degrading the visibility of the signal .",
    "systematic uncertainties due to detector effects such as photon detection effeciency , energy scales and resolutions are believed to be small and can be estimated from comparison of data with well understood processes , such as @xmath70 , compton scattering , bhabha , @xmath71 and @xmath4 events .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the integrated luminosity are expected to be below 0.5% , and statistical uncertainties due to final simulation sample sizes should be kept below few percent .",
    "simulations of the standard model background channels are expected to yield most of the sytematic uncertainties .",
    "the use of different event generators would keep this uncertainty under control and agreement between them within few percent is expected . taking all these effects together and accounting for a precise measurement of the inclusive higgs cross section of about 4% or less @xcite",
    ", it appears that the error on bf(@xmath8 ) will be dominated by the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the effect of overlap of @xmath34 to @xmath54 events has also been studied .",
    "the @xmath72 events due to photons radiated in the electro - magnetic interactions of the colliding beams have been generated by the guinea pig program @xcite with a rate modelled in @xcite .",
    "pythia @xcite has been used to generate the hadrons .",
    "the latest version of simdet @xcite overlays the @xmath72 events to @xmath5 events , and all final state particles are then reconstructed . without special care to isolate the particles from @xmath72 interactions",
    ", we found that the higgs events were recognized without notable loss or distortions after passing any of the selection procedure .",
    "we have examined the prospects at a future linear @xmath1collider of measuring the branching fraction of a standard model - like higgs boson into the @xmath6 boson and a photon , bf(@xmath8 ) .",
    "higgs boson masses of 120 , 140 and 160 gev and in integrated luminosity of @xmath26 = 1 ab@xmath2 at @xmath25 = 500 gev were assumed . in order to estimate the precision on bf(@xmath8 ) which can be attained",
    ", all expected background processes were included in the analysis , and acceptances and resolutions of a linear collider detector were taken into account .",
    "in particular , by simulating the 2-to-4 particle reactions @xmath1@xmath73 , in which the signal reaction @xmath5 is embedded , the complete irreducible background has been taken into account .",
    "only @xmath74 @xmath75decays were included so far .    since reactions like @xmath1@xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and radiative return @xmath79 events also constitute potentially serious background sources for the @xmath5 signal , different selection techniques ( consecutive cuts , jet finders , higgs - likeness )",
    "were applied and have been shown to result in tolerable background levels and higgs detection in the rare @xmath8decay . as the favored selection procedure",
    "the higgs - likeness technique has been found , with 15 to 30 identified signal events , comparable to the other methods , but with lowest total background .    for unpolarized beams , the expected relative precision for the @xmath8branching fraction",
    "was found to be 48% ( 27% , 44% ) for @xmath9 = 120 ( 140 , 160 ) gev , after accounting for all @xmath6 decays and convolution with the uncertainty on the inclusive @xmath4 fusion higgs boson cross - section .",
    "for @xmath64 beam polarisation of -0.8 and @xmath65 beam polarisation of + 0.6 , the @xmath4 fusion cross - section @xmath43(@xmath1@xmath80 is significantly enhanced , so improving substantially the precision on bf(@xmath8 ) to 28@xmath81 ( 17@xmath81 , 26@xmath81 ) , even taking into account the fact that the dominant irreducible background scales in the same way . with these uncertainties",
    "it should be possible to deduce a relative precision for the @xmath8partial width of @xmath82 , if an uncertainty of 5% for the total higgs width @xcite is included .",
    "this in turn allows to expect a relative precision for the @xmath0 coupling of 15% ( 9% , 14% ) for @xmath9 = 120 ( 140 , 160 ) gev .",
    "overlap of @xmath34 to @xmath54 events due to photons radiated in the electro - magnetic interactions of the colliding beams would not alter the uncertainties accessible .",
    "the results presented also suggest that the @xmath4 fusion reaction @xmath5 at 500 gev would be superior in @xmath8branching fraction measurements to the higgs - strahlung process @xmath1@xmath83 at lower energies , e.g. at @xmath25 = 300 gev @xcite , in particular if polarised beams are taken into account .",
    "however , detailed analyses are needed for the latter process to establish present indications .    for higgs masses significantly above 160 gev",
    ", it will be difficult to determine the @xmath0 coupling with valuable precision since the @xmath8branching fraction is too small to be accurately measured .    in summary ,",
    "our results confirms the unique ability of a linear @xmath1collider to access and reliably measure fundamental higgs boson parameters in the presence of initially overwhelming background with final state signature similar to the signal events .",
