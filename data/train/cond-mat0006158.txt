    "recently tsuchiya an katori @xcite have introduced a non conservative abelian sandpile model with a toppling rule similar to that of the well known bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw ) sandpile model @xcite .",
    "the model is defined in a square lattice of size @xmath0 and an integer energy profile @xmath1 is considered .",
    "sites with energy below the threshold @xmath2 are stable .",
    "if the energy at any given site @xmath3 exceeds this threshold the site transfer energy to its four nearest neighbors following the toppling rule : @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . @xmath7 is an integer number and @xmath8 is such that @xmath9 is also integer .",
    "the boundaries are assumed to be open and the system is perturbed by adding a unit of energy at a site selected at random and letting it evolve until an equilibrium configuration is reached .    on each toppling event an amount of energy @xmath10 is dissipated . for @xmath11",
    "the model is conservative , it is just the btw model but with a different scale of toppling and energy addition . in the btw model",
    "@xcite the energy added to perturb the system is 1 and on toppling an active site transfers an energy 1 to each neighbor , they are of the same order . in the model defined above the energy added is still 1 but the energy transferred on toppling is @xmath7 . in the limit @xmath11 and @xmath12 the btw model @xcite is recovered while for @xmath11 and @xmath13 it is similar to the btw model but with a uniform driving .    in the btw model ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) the avalanches can be decomposed in a sequence of sub avalanches called waves @xcite with well defined finite size scaling properties . on the contrary ,",
    "the distribution of the overall avalanche size @xmath14 is better described using a multi - fractal analysis @xcite .",
    "the break down of the finite size scaling has been recently shown to be a consequence of the existence of correlations in the sequence of waves @xcite .",
    "for @xmath15 the model is non conservative but still abelian @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath16 , exact calculations by tsuchiya and katori yield the mean avalanche size ( including avalanches with size zero ) @xmath17 @xcite . since @xmath18 they concluded that in the limit @xmath19 @xmath20 diverges .",
    "however , as it is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] this conclusion is wrong because @xmath8 can not goes to zero in an arbitrary way , in order to satisfy the constraint that @xmath2 remains integer .",
    "here it is demonstrated that @xmath21 and , therefore , @xmath22 for all possible values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the main goal of this work is to investigate the scaling properties of this non conservative btw like model in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the main questions are related with the existence or not of criticality in the conservative limit @xmath19 and if in this limit one recovers the conventional btw model @xmath11 . from the analysis of the energy scales involved in the model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] ) and numerical simulations ( sec . [ sec : numerical ] ) it is concluded that the model is critical when @xmath19 but it does not belong to the universality class of the btw model . its relation with other non conservative models with btw like toppling rule introduced in the literature",
    "@xcite is also discussed ( sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] ) .",
    "in this section some scaling laws are derived based on the energy scales involved in the model .",
    "the main idea of this approach is that the balance between input and dissipation of energy determine the scaling of some magnitudes with the dissipation per toppling event , following the general guidelines introduced by vespiganani _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "for this purpose the avalanches are assumed to be instantaneous and the analysis is focused in the time scale of the driving field . on each step one",
    "adds 1 unit of energy and measure the toppling activity and the energy dissipated . on each toppling event",
    "an amount of energy @xmath18 is locally dissipated while an amount @xmath23 is transferred to nearest neighbors . for boundary sites part of the energy is also dissipated through the boundary .",
    "let @xmath24 be the green function @xcite , the average number of toppling events at a distance @xmath25 from the site where the energy was added .",
    "close to @xmath26 the effect of local dissipation gives an small contribution and the main energy scale is given by the transport of the energy from active sites to their nearest neighbors .",
    "on the contrary , far from @xmath26 the effects of the local dissipation becomes more important .",
    "how far will depend on certain correlation length @xmath27 , such that for @xmath28 transport is more important than local dissipation while for @xmath29 the opposite occurs .    thus , there are two characteristic lengths in this model : the system size @xmath0 and the correlation length @xmath27 .",
    "the analysis developed above is valid in the thermodynamic limit @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the dissipation through the boundary of the system is negligible in comparison with the energy dissipated on each toppling event . in such a situation the only way to reach an stationary state is to balance the input of energy from the driving field with the energy locally dissipated .",
    "moreover , since @xmath27 is the only characteristic length @xmath24 is expected to satisfy the scaling law @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an scaling exponent and @xmath33 is the spatial dimension .",
    "the amount of energy @xmath34 locally dissipated inside an hyper - circle of radius @xmath25 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and the second proportionality is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the average energy transported through its boundary @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39/dx$ ] and the second proportionality is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the correlation length @xmath27 can be defined as the radius @xmath25 at which this two contribution becomes of the same order . with this definition and equating eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) with @xmath40 it results that @xmath41    on the other hand , on each step 1 unit of energy is added and in average the amount @xmath42 is dissipated , where @xmath43 is the mean avalanche size counting even the case when it has size 0 .",
    "equating this two contributions it results that @xmath44 moreover , using eq .",
    "one obtains ( [ eq:1 ] ) @xmath45    eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) reproduces the exact result by tsuchiya and katori .",
    "the present approach is however based on more general arguments an can be easily adapted to any sandpile model with local dissipation . the same argument ( energy balance ) has been previously used by vespiganani _",
    "et al _ @xcite to understand the scaling properties of other sandpile models with local dissipation . here",
    ", a slightly different approach has been considered where the new parameter @xmath7 , the ratio between the energy received from nearest active neighbors and from the driving field , has been taken into account .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) tsuchiya and katori concluded that when @xmath19 @xmath20 diverges .",
    "however , this conclusion is not valid if @xmath46 is restricted to be an integer number . to show this",
    "let us write @xmath47 which follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "but @xmath48 is restricted to take integer values . with @xmath7 being an integer number the only way to satisfy this requirement",
    "is that @xmath49 is also integer , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "then , since the smaller non negative integer is 1 it is concluded that @xmath21 and , therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) @xmath22 , i.e. it is bounded .    nevertheless , the correlation length @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) does not only depend on @xmath49 but also on @xmath7 . for fixed @xmath49",
    "it diverges in the limit @xmath51 and the model is critical .",
    "the real control parameter is then @xmath52 , i.e. the energy dissipated per toppling event relative to the characteristic energy scale of transport @xmath7 .",
    "although this result is in complete agreement with the field theory approach of vespignani _ et al _ @xcite the fact that @xmath20 does not diverges when @xmath53 ( @xmath51 ) excludes this model from their analysis .",
    "moreover , in previous sandpile models conservation implies the scaling law @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mean avalanche size excluding those with size 0 @xcite . to investigate the validity of such scaling relation for the present model",
    "let us take into account that @xmath56 is related to @xmath20 through the expression @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the probability to obtain an avalanche with non zero size . in the models considered by vespignani _",
    "@xcite @xmath12 and , therefore , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , ( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) it results that @xmath59",
    ". moreover , in this models @xmath58 has a finite value and , therefore , one obtains the mentioned scaling law @xmath60 .    on the contrary , in the model considered here @xmath55",
    "can not be related to @xmath27 using these arguments . for fixed @xmath49 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) one obtains that @xmath61 .",
    "thus , from the energy balance invoked above we can not say anything about the scaling of @xmath55 with @xmath27 ( an exponent 2 will be an accidental coincidence ) and , therefore , this model belongs to a new universality class .",
    "in this sections results obtained from numerical simulations of the model studied above are presented .",
    "the simulations were performed using @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath7 ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ranging from 1 to @xmath67 ) . for these values the condition @xmath68 was observed to be satisfied .",
    "statistics was taken over @xmath69 avalanches after the system reached the stationary state .    before entering in the analysis of the statistics of the avalanches",
    "let us check the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "the log - log plot of @xmath55 vs. @xmath7 is shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] . a clear linear behavior is observed for @xmath70 suggesting that above this value simple scaling applies . on top of this",
    "points the numerically computed values of @xmath71 are plotted obtaining an overlap in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) . if the scaling relation @xmath72 where valid , using eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , @xmath73 .",
    "however , a linear fit to this log - log plot gives a slope @xmath74 .",
    "the fact that this scaling relation thus not hold is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where the stationary energy distribution is shown .",
    "as it can be seen @xmath75 does not decreases as @xmath76 but slower , which explains why @xmath77 increases with @xmath7 with a slope smaller than 1 . the rest of the distribution scales like @xmath76 which is just a consequence of the increase of the density of possible values of @xmath78 .",
    "the avalanche statistics will be characterized by : the number of toppling events @xmath14 and steps @xmath79 required to reach an stable configuration , the number of sites @xmath80 `` touched '' by the avalanche , and the characteristic radius of the cluster formed by these sites @xmath25 .",
    "the main goal of the simulations is to determine the probability densities @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) in the stationary state .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath83 , in other words sites topples only once within an avalanche . in this model , as a difference with the original btw model , only one wave of topplings takes place .",
    "the first wave if generated from an initial site with height @xmath84 .",
    "when this site topples it transfers an amount equal to @xmath9 to its nearest neighbors and , therefore , ends with energy @xmath85 .",
    "the best we can have to obtain a second toppling at this site is that its four nearest neighbors also become active .",
    "in such a case the initial side will receive @xmath86 units of energy , which is not enough to make it active again .",
    "hence , no second wave will be obtained yielding @xmath83 .",
    "since the waves are known to satisfy well defined finite - size scaling properties and in the present model an avalanche is made by one wave it is expected that the distributions @xmath81 also satisfy a finite - size scaling .",
    "however , the scaling exponents will not necessarily be those obtained for the scaling of waves because , in the present model , conservation does not introduce any scaling relation among the different scaling exponents .",
    "if finite size scaling applies then these densities will satisfy @xmath87 , \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the power law exponent characterizing the self - similar regime and @xmath89 is a cut off above which the distribution deviates from a power law and has a fast decay given by @xmath90 .",
    "the validity of this scaling form is supported by the numerical results .",
    "the cut off @xmath89 is determined by the existence of the characteristic length @xmath91 and is expected to scale as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is an effective fractal dimension .    to compute the exponents @xmath88 and @xmath94 the moment analysis technique introduced by de menech _ et",
    "al _ @xcite is used .",
    "the moments of the probability density in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) are given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 the last equivalence in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) is valid for values of @xmath97 not to small , for which the precise form of @xmath81 at small @xmath98 is not important .",
    "@xmath99 can be determined from a linear fit to the log - log plot of @xmath100 vs. @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting values using @xmath101 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . in all cases ( @xmath102 ) for @xmath97 larger than 1 a well defined linear dependence is observed .",
    "from the linear fit ( see eq .",
    "[ eq:10 ] ) to these plots the exponents @xmath88 and @xmath94 are computed .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the exponent @xmath103 is very close to @xmath104 in very good agreement with the scaling arguments of previous section . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath105 is quite close to 1 which implies that the avalanche size ( or area ) scale as @xmath106 , i.e. avalanches are compact @xmath107 .",
    "with this value , the scaling relation @xmath108 yields the power law exponent @xmath109 which is clearly in disagreement with the value computed numerically .",
    "the reason for this result is that conservation does not introduce any scaling relation as it generally occurs in sandpile models @xcite .",
    "the exponents computed using the moment analysis technique can be checked using rescaled plots of the integrated distribution @xmath110 .",
    "the resulting plots are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , [ fig:5 ] , and [ fig:6 ] . the scaling works quite good supporting the validity of the reported exponents .    in the literature we can find other sandpile models with local dissipation and btw like toppling rule @xcite . in the models considered in @xcite and @xcite the energy profile is continuous and the dissipation rate per toppling event @xmath49 is a control parameter which can take any real value and , therefore , can be tuned to zero .",
    "another feature of these models is that only one wave of toppling can take place and , therefore , for any finite @xmath49 the model is in a different universality class from that of the btw model .",
    "on the other hand in @xcite the energy profile is discrete as in the original btw model at the prize of introducing stochasticity in the model . in this case with a probability @xmath111 energy is fully dissipated yielding an average dissipation per toppling event @xmath112 .",
    "clearly @xmath111 may take any real variable between 0 and 1 and , therefore , also in this case the dissipation per toppling event can be fine tuned to zero .",
    "as a difference with the models described in the previous paragraph , in this case multiple toppling of a site within an avalanche is possible , which make it closer to the original btw model .",
    "moreover , the use of finite size scaling techniques can be also questioned and a multi - fractal analysis may be more appropriate @xcite , which is another characteristic feature of the btw model @xcite .",
    "all this elements together with the numerical results reported in @xcite suggest that in the limit @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) this model belong to the same universality class of the btw model .    a common feature of all this models @xcite is that @xmath115 as predicted by the field theory approach of vespignani _ et al _ @xcite , leading to the scaling relation @xmath108 . on the contrary , in the present model the scaling of @xmath56 with @xmath116",
    "is not known and conservation does not introduce the above scaling relation .",
    "hence , the model introduced by tsuchiya and katori belongs to different class among sandpile models .",
    "a non conservative abelian sandpile model with a btw like toppling rule has been studied .",
    "the model can be though as the only possible generalization of the btw model to include local dissipation without introducing stochasticity in the toppling rule and keeping a discrete energy profile .",
    "however , the scaling approach and numerical the simulations reported here show that it does not belong to the universality class of the btw model , not even to the universality class of any sandpile model previously considered in the literature .",
