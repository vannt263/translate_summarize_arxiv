    "carbon fullerenes form a remarkable series of molecules whose physical and chemical properties are relatively well known .",
    "their properties can be controlled through size , shape , and structure@xcite .",
    "they can be functionalized , doped with endohedral or exohedral atoms , or polymerized @xcite .",
    "c@xmath3 is the most stable and well - studied molecule in the series .",
    "it has been widely used _",
    "e.g. _ in the design of efficient organic photovoltaic cells @xcite and as precursor in the growth of carbon nanotubes and nanopeapods @xcite .",
    "the strength of carbon @xmath6 bonds makes fullerenes extremely stable , and the ability of carbon to form bonds with different hybridization levels makes possible the existence of both hexagonal and pentagonal rings and hence a rich variety of sizes and shapes@xcite .",
    "in fact , carbon is the main constituent of a wide range of nanostructures from diamondoids to organic molecules , including fullerenes and nanotubes .",
    "it is likely that nano - electronic devices with desired properties can be created through intentional selection of specific carbon nanostructures@xcite . in order to systematically design such devices",
    "it is necessary to develop a thorough understanding of the electronic and optical properties of the nanostructure , either isolated or in a functionalized medium .",
    "detailed knowledge of the electronic structure of fullerene molecules is the key to explore several properties of those systems . as an example",
    ", the conductance of fullerene - based junctions depends crucially on the relative energy of electronic orbitals on the molecule with respect to the chemical potential on the leads @xcite .",
    "experimental characterization is often hindered at the nanoscale and therefore theory plays an increasingly important role in nano - science as a guide for experimental interpretation . while it is often claimed that theory can be used to design nanomaterials with targeted properties , for theory to have predictive power it is crucial to validate it in those precious cases where the comparison with experiment can be made .",
    "carbon compounds including nanotubes , @xcite adamatanes and fullerenes are among the few nanomaterials that have been characterized in terms of structure and composition .",
    "in this paper we apply the two most accurate approaches for calculating electronic / optical properties , the gw - bethe salpeter equation ( gw - bse ) approach @xcite and diffusion quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite . these methods are complementary : the gw - bse approach is based primarily on approximate green s functions and in - principle yields the entire optical spectrum , while qmc uses a stochastic sampling approach that is in - principle exact for the lowest energy excitation of each symmetry@xcite .",
    "due to recent algorithmic advances and a favourable scaling with system size , both of these methods can provide the optical properties of nanostructures with one hundred atoms or more using existing parallel computers @xcite . while gw - bse and qmc have previously shown good agreement for small molecules @xcite , this is the first comprehensive study of these methods for these much larger yet prototypical nanostructures .",
    "owing to the complexity involved in both qmc and gw - bse when applied to electronically confined systems , not much is known about the accuracy of either theory in confined nanostructures .",
    "we study a range of fullerenes ( c@xmath0 , c@xmath1 , c@xmath2 , c@xmath3 , c@xmath4 , and c@xmath5 ) , with the aim of answering these questions : ( 1 ) do these methods accurately predict the optical and electronic properties , particularly for the best experimentally characterized c@xmath3 molecule ?",
    "( 2 ) what are the trends in the physical properties across the fullerene series ? ( 3 ) where are improvements in each method required ?",
    "fullerenes are routinely produced in a wide range of sizes , from c@xmath0 to c@xmath7 or larger , and many isomers have been identified @xcite .",
    "the existence of several low - energy isomers for each molecular size poses a difficulty in modeling fullerenes . for each computed size",
    "we have chosen high - symmetry structures that satisfy the isolated pentagon rule @xcite as closely as possible .",
    "figure [ f - balls ] depicts the isomers investigated here , with the corresponding point groups .",
    "the atomic coordinates were obtained by minimizing the total energy within norm - conserving pseudopotential calculations using dft and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional @xcite .",
    "choices of grid point separation , energy cutoffs and supercell sizes were such that kohn - sham eigenvalues of bound orbitals are converged to 0.02  ev or better and bond lengths to 1% or better .",
    "atom coordinates are included in the supporting information accompanying this paper@xcite .",
    "owing to its simplicity , density - functional theory ( dft ) has been used to predict the electronic properties of nanostructures . nevertheless , it has two major deficiencies : ( 1 ) it can only describe the energy of optical excitations through _ ad hoc _ approaches such as constrained dft @xcite ; and ( 2 ) it is not possible to systematically improve the description of exchange and correlation effects within dft because the exact exchange - correlation functional can not be calculated in closed form @xcite .",
    "in contrast , many - body approaches can be systematically improved , at the expense of increased numerical complexity .    in the framework of the gw approximation @xcite",
    ", electron self - energies are calculated in terms of the green s function @xmath8 and the screened coulomb interaction @xmath9 as : @xmath10 where screening is commonly evaluated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we can modify eq .",
    "( [ e - gw0 ] ) by replacing the rpa with time - dependent dft with an adiabatic , local - density kernel ( tdlda ) . in order to retain feynman diagrams with the same order , we add a properly symmetrized vertex term together with the tdlda screened coulomb interaction @xcite :    @xmath11    at its lowest level of approximation , the green s function and the screened coulomb interaction above are calculated within dft @xcite .",
    "further improvement in the theory is attained by imposing self - consistency among the self - energy @xmath12 , green s function @xmath8 and screened coulomb interaction @xmath9 @xcite we impose self - consistency in an iterative scheme . in the first iteration",
    ", we calculate the self - energy using dft electronic orbitals and eq .",
    "( [ e - gwf ] ) . in subsequent iterations",
    ", we use a scissors operator to correct the energy of dft orbitals , according to the self - energy calculated in the previous iteration .",
    "we stress the fact that the scissors operator is constructed using information from the previous iteration only .",
    "no free parameters are involved .",
    "we stop when electron affinity and ionization potential are converged to within 0.02 ev .",
    "usually , this is reached in less than five iterations .",
    "tests performed on smaller molecules ( cl@xmath13 , benzene , co , sih@xmath14 ) indicate that going behond the scissors operator method would improve the final results by 0.1  ev or less .",
    "scissors operators have been used extensively in the context of electronic band structure of bulk semiconductors ( see ref . and references therein ) . in the following ,",
    "we refer to eqs .",
    "( [ e - gw0 ] ) and ( [ e - gwf ] ) as gw@xmath15 and gw@xmath16 approximations respectively .",
    "we denote by scgw@xmath16 approximation the self - consistent solution of eq .",
    "( [ e - gwf ] ) , where self - consistency is imposed through a scissors operator . after",
    "the quasi - particle orbitals are determined , we calculate optical excitations by diagonalizing the bethe - salpeter equation for electrons and holes following standard methodologies @xcite .",
    "the bse method has been used successfully to predict excitation energies of organic molecules @xcite , cdse nanocrystals @xcite and hydrogenated silicon clusters @xcite .    in the qmc methodology ( for a review ,",
    "@xcite ) , excitation energies are obtained via the difference in total energy between the ground state and individually constructed excited states .",
    "we use the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) technique with trial wave - functions consisting of a single slater determinant of single - particle orbitals multiplied by a jastrow correlation function @xcite .",
    "the most significant approximation is the fixed - node approximation , whereby the fermion nodes of a trial wave - function are used in place of the exact nodes , introducing a variational error .",
    "although dmc calculations for large systems additionally require the use of pseudopotentials , for carbon - based systems this approximation is secondary .",
    "we evaluate the pseudopotentials within the locality approximation . a test calculation for c@xmath0 using a variational pseudopotential evaluation@xcite found a global shift of @xmath17 ev but identical energy differences to within @xmath18 ev , demonstrating that this error is small in the fullerenes . in practice ,",
    "the accuracy of the results obtained for excitations is solely determined by the accuracy of the ground and excited state nodal surfaces .",
    "in contrast , the gw calculations are dependent on the detailed shape of the kohn - sham orbitals and the initial kohn - sham eigenvalues . given exact nodes for the ground state and for the first excited state of a given symmetry , dmc yields in - principle exact results@xcite .",
    "in general , there are additional symmetry related qualifications @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we use the kohn - sham orbitals from the ground state dft calculation in the slater determinant to effectively define the nodal surface of the trial wavefunction .",
    "dmc was used recently to calculate excitation energies and ionization energies of diamondoids yielding very good results @xcite .    to make comparisons between gw - bse and qmc on an equal footing we used the same norm conserving pseudopotential in each set of calculations .",
    "the initial qmc wave - functions were obtained from a local - density approximation ( lda ) dft calculation , while for gw calculations we additionally investigated the pbe@xcite gradient corrected functionals .",
    "gw@xmath16 electron affinities and vertical ionization potentials obtained using the lda are higher than the ones obtained using pbe by a fraction of electron - volt : 0.1  ev in c@xmath3 and 0.3  ev in c@xmath0 .",
    "the impact of replacing the lda with pbe on kohn - sham eigenvalues is even smaller : less than 0.05  ev . in view of these small differences",
    "we concentrate on lda - derived results .",
    "we have investigated two isomers of c@xmath5 .",
    "dft calculations have already indicated that c@xmath5 exists in a large number of isomers , where the oval shaped structure ( point group d@xmath19 ) is the most stable one @xcite .",
    "our dft calculations predict that the icosahedral isomer ( i@xmath20 ) is more energetic than the d@xmath19 isomer by 0.8  ev , confirming earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "this difference increases to @xmath21 ev in qmc .",
    "table [ t - ip ] shows the vertical ionization potential ( ip ) calculated within the gw and qmc theories .",
    "the ionization potential was also calculated using dft only , as the difference in total energy between the neutral and the charged molecules ( `` @xmath22scf - dft '' ) column .",
    "the ip is approximately 7.5  ev for all of the theories , with no well defined trend in ip with size apart from a slow decrease with increasing number of atoms .",
    "the analyzed structures have different curvatures , caused by the different positions of pentagonal rings from molecule to molecule .",
    "therefore , geometry and symmetry become important factors in determining the ionization potential . a classical electrostatic model based simply on a charged hollow sphere",
    "can only predict qualitatively the ionization potential of fullerenes @xcite . except for c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 ,",
    "the qmc ionization potential is lower than the gw@xmath16 ionization potential .",
    "the discrepancy between the two approaches is around 0.2  ev , close to the numerical accuracy associated with each theory . except for gw@xmath15",
    "all the methods predict ips close to experiment .",
    "self - consistency in the gw method is found to give very small improvement on the already accurate ip .",
    "table [ t - ip ] also shows that the gw@xmath16 approximation predicts an ip much more accurate than the gw@xmath15 approximation .",
    "therefore , including vertex corrections and polarizability effects beyond rpa are an improvement on the theory , confirming similar observations in benzene and naphthalene molecules @xcite .",
    ".vertical ionization potentials calculated from dft , qmc and gw theories .",
    "error bars in qmc values are indicated between parentheses .",
    "all energies in ev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , table [ t - triplet ] shows that the most stable fullerenes , namely c@xmath3 ( i@xmath20 ) and c@xmath4 ( d@xmath23 ) , have the largest triplet excitation energies .",
    "less stable fullerenes have small triplet excitation energy , of the order of 0.4  ev , whereas c@xmath5(i@xmath20 ) is predicted to have the smallest triplet energy : 0.11  ev ( tdlda ) .",
    "knowing that triplet excitation energies are related to the energy gap , this trend shows perfectly correlation between stability and energy gap : stable fullerenes have wide gap between homo and lumo , unstable fullerenes have narrow gap between homo and lumo .",
    "we have calculated and analyzed the low energy excitations of fullerenes c@xmath0 to c@xmath5 using three theoretical methods : density functional theory , many - body gw - bse and diffusion quantum monte carlo .",
    "overall these methods give an accurate description of the optical properties .",
    "ionization potentials are approximately constant and well predicted by all methods .",
    "the more stable fullerenes ( c@xmath3 and c@xmath4 ) are found to have highest excitation energy .",
    "stability correlates well with energy gap .",
    "we find a weak dependence of electron affinity with molecule size , with important implications for doping and functionalization of fullerenes .",
    "we find that two ingredients are essential to bring gw - bse predictions to agree with experimental data : vertex corrections , which are responsible for an almost rigid shift of electronic orbitals with respect to the vacuum level , and self - consistency , which widens the energy gap between occupied orbitals and unoccupied orbitals .",
    "qmc calculations of the lowest energy triplet excitation using a single determinant of kohn - sham orbitals give results higher than experiment by approximately 0.8  ev , indicating that the dft - derived trial wave - functions presumably give nodal errors of that magnitude .",
    "therefore while qmc calculation of even larger systems are possible as the systems size increases so does the nodal error .",
    "methods to improve the nodal structure are required to achieve a _",
    "total _ energy resolution of 0.1  ev .",
    "we believe the above observations will guide method selection for excitations in nanostructures .",
    "clearly , the robust design of optical nanoarchitectures will require further developments in many - body theories such as gw - bse and qmc .",
    "we also encourage more precise experimental determination of electronic excitations in well - characterized nanostructures to provide a more severe test to theory .",
