    "stellar populations with densities less than about @xmath2 stars / pc@xmath1 have a binary fraction , @xmath3 of at least 50 per cent . for example , in the solar neighbourhood ( density 1 star / pc@xmath1 ) @xmath4 @xcite or in ob associations ( density @xmath5 star / pc@xmath1 ) @xmath6 @xcite . in star - forming regions",
    "the binary fractions can be even higher , such as in the taurus - auriga groups ( density about 10 stars / pc@xmath1 ) where the fraction is near 100 per cent ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but even in high - density star - forming regions , such as the 1 myr old orion nebula cluster which has a density of @xmath7 stars / pc@xmath1 @xcite , the binary fraction is near 50 per cent @xcite .",
    "stellar - dynamical models have demonstrated that the orion nebula cluster must be expanding and that consequently further destruction of binary systems has mostly ceased @xcite . only in globular clusters , which are dense ( @xmath8 stars / pc@xmath1 ) and which have a long dynamical history over a hubble time , are binary fractions observed to be less than 10 - 20 per cent @xcite .",
    "but this is probably understandable as a result of the destruction of binary systems , first in the very dense initial configuration which these objects typically formed with @xcite , followed by long - term binary - star burning .",
    "+   + pal  14 is an old globular cluster with a mass of about 10@xmath9 , a ( three - dimensional ) half - light radius of 34 pc , and is located at a distance of 71 kpc from the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "it has a low density ( 0.1 - 0.2 stars / pc@xmath1 ) and so conformity with known stellar populations would imply it to have @xmath10 .",
    "measurements of @xmath11 would thus allow testing the dependence of the binary population on the physical conditions during star formation , as pal  14 is a low - metallicity population that formed nearly a hubble time ago @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest that pal  14 may be significantly mass segregated .",
    "how mass segregation can affect a velocity dispersion measurement has not been investigated , though . +   + however , pal  14 is also interesting for testing gravitational theories . that binaries can affect the dynamical mass estimate of stellar populations",
    "has already been studied in the context of dwarf - spheroidal satellite galaxies by @xcite and has recently been re - addressed by @xcite and @xcite for star clusters in the milky way disk .",
    "the measured ( one - dimensional ) velocity dispersion of pal  14 is ( @xmath12 ) km / s or ( @xmath13 ) km / s , depending on whether the outlying `` star 15 '' of a sample investigated by @xcite is included or not , respectively .",
    "now , if pal  14 has a binary fraction of 50 per cent or more , then the velocity dispersion measured from a single spectroscopic snapshot may be significantly contaminated , i.e. inflated , because of the binary - star orbital motions of the tracer stars .",
    "a potential problem arising here is that the dynamical velocity dispersion of the cluster must be about 0.5 km / s for newtonian dynamics to hold .",
    "so there is not much room for a binary - star contribution to the measured velocity dispersion . alternatively ,",
    "if the binary population is normal ( i.e. canonical ) , then the true ( binary - corrected ) velocity dispersion of the virialised cluster may be much smaller than the newtonian value .",
    "if this were the case , then a newtonian crisis would emerge , such that pal  14 would be `` kinematically frigid '' , a situation which is not expected from current theoretical dynamics . a third possibility is given by the unreliability of low - number statistics in such systems , i.e. a sample of about 17 stars may simply be insufficient to determine the velocity dispersion of such a stellar system .",
    "+   + thus , either pal  14 is in virial equilibrium , such that its stellar population would be non - canonical ( a binary fraction much lower than all other known populations ) . or , the cluster has a canonical stellar population , but is then kinematically frigid , in violation of newtonian dynamics .",
    "this would not be remedied by mond , because according to mond the cluster ought to have an even larger velocity dispersion than the newtonian value @xcite . the third explanation , of low - number statistics ,",
    "would imply that velocity dispersion measurements of low - velocity stellar systems would have to be taken with much more caution than is done in practice nowadays .",
    "+   + with this contribution we assess the expected velocity dispersion of pal  14 assuming various binary fractions and newtonian dynamics to be valid ( section 2 ) .",
    "these numerical experiments are compared to the observed velocities in the cluster in section 3 .",
    "the conclusions are contained in section 4 .",
    "for the purpose of testing the observed velocity dispersion of pal  14 , we create artificial star clusters with the observed properties of pal  14 and measure the velocity dispersion in these clusters .",
    "therefore we use the code mcluster ( kpper et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , an open - source project developed at aifa bonn to set up clusters for @xmath14-body computations , especially for nbody6 @xcite .",
    "we use this software to conveniently generate 300 renditions of pal  14 with various properties for taking out mock observations and testing the findings of @xcite on their conclusiveness . +   + the parameters for the artificial clusters we take from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most important quantity in this respect is the total mass of the cluster as it should be closely linked to the velocity dispersion in the assumed case of the cluster being in virial equilibrium .",
    "using star counts , @xcite find a mass for pal  14 between @xmath15 without taking into account compact remnants , and depending on the assumed mass function within the cluster .",
    "assuming additional 15 - 20 per cent mass in stellar remnants ( @xcite , and dabringhausen private communication ) yields a mass range for pal  14 of @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the two cases of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "+   + as the density distribution we choose a plummer sphere with a half - mass radius of 32 pc , which is the observed half - light radius of pal  14 of 128 @xcite at the assumed distance of ( @xmath19 ) kpc @xcite . setting the half - light radius equal to the half - mass radius",
    "assumes that mass follows light , just as @xcite have done in their investigation , i.e. that the cluster is not significantly mass segregated .",
    "moreover , the infinite plummer distribution is cut off at the jacobi radius ( @xmath20 pc for @xmath21 ) assuming a galactic circular velocity of 220 km / s at the galactocentric radius of pal  14 . +   + as the mass function of the cluster stars we use the canonical imf @xcite , but cut it off at a maximum stellar mass of @xmath22 as all stars above this mass should have died by stellar evolution at the expected age of pal  14 of 11.5 gyr @xcite . even though @xcite find a shallower slope in the range of @xmath23 to @xmath24 , we argue that the actual slope of the mass function is not very important in this respect as the velocities of the cluster stars get drawn independently of each other and we , in the end , only observe stars of mass above @xmath25 to be consistent with @xcite . +   + for investigating the effect of a realistic binary population on the velocity dispersion , we set up the binary population following the @xcite period distribution for field stars and a thermal eccentricity distribution .",
    "the binary orbital planes are distributed randomly , as are the orbital phases .",
    "we reject binaries with a semi - major axis below 100 @xmath26 , though , as these binaries may have been destroyed in a common - envelope phase of the binary components @xcite .",
    "moreover , we use random pairing for the binary components since we are dealing with an evolved population of low - mass stars .",
    "we vary the binary fraction , @xmath11 , from 0 to 1 and generate ten clusters for each binary fraction to gain better statistics . +   + in addition , we set up clusters with the above properties but being mass segregated .",
    "therefore , we use the procedure defined in @xcite which is implemented through plumix in mcluster .",
    "@xcite defines the degree of mass segregation through a single parameter , @xmath27 , which can vary from 0 ( not segregated ) to 1 ( completely mass segregated ) . to keep the number of models to a minimum",
    ", we concentrate on the cluster with @xmath28 without binaries , and see how mass segregation affects its velocity dispersion . again we generate 10 clusters for each value of @xmath27 .",
    "+   + the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath29 , we measure from our clusters by calculating @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mean velocity in the sample , and @xmath32 is the mean squared velocity .",
    "we do this separately in three different directions and take each as an independent measurement . +   + in fig .",
    "[ sigma_all ] we show the mean velocity dispersions for all stars above @xmath25 for ten different binary fractions and for both cluster masses .",
    "the error bars give the standard deviation of the different cluster renditions from the mean .",
    "the clusters without binaries have a very little spread about the mean whereas already a binary fraction of 0.1 introduces such a large scatter that the two mass groups of clusters overlap within their error bars . at a binary fraction of 0.5 the two mass groups are indistinguishable as their velocity dispersion",
    "gets completely dominated by the binary population . at a binary fraction of 1.0",
    "the velocity dispersion is about four times larger than in the case without binaries . +   + in fig .",
    "[ sigma_5kms ] we show the velocity dispersion when we draw 17 stars out of the total sample of stars above @xmath25 , just as @xcite have done .",
    "the data points show the mean of @xmath33 renditions out of the ten clusters for each binary fraction .",
    "again we took the line - of - sight velocity dispersions independently along three different directions for each rendition . since the final distribution of velocity dispersions for",
    "each binary fraction does not follow a gaussian distribution but is rather asymmetric , the error bars show 68 per cent of all renditions below the mean and 68 per cent of all renditions above the mean .",
    "+   + we rejected stars , though , when their velocities were off the mean by more than 2.5 km / s , i.e. only took stars within a velocity window of @xmath34 km / s into account .",
    "this is similar to the way @xcite get their velocity dispersion of pal  14 , and is the usual practise to discriminate between cluster members and non - members .",
    "we see that the mean measured velocity dispersion can increase by about 50 per cent compared to the velocity dispersion of all stars above @xmath25 if we only have 17 stars in our sample .",
    "this effect is small for low binary fractions but gets significant above a binary fraction of about 0.3 .",
    "moreover , the scatter in our velocity dispersion measurement is huge . at @xmath35",
    "we can measure values between 1 km / s and 3 km / s , depending on which stars we take into our sample . at a binary fraction of 1.0",
    "the mean measured velocity dispersion is about 7 times larger than the newtonian velocity dispersion without binaries . +   + in fig .",
    "[ sigma_10kms ] we show the same experiment but with a velocity window of @xmath36 km / s .",
    "the effect described above gets more significant .",
    "the mean value of the measured velocity dispersion increases and also the scatter grows . at @xmath35",
    "we can get values between 1 km / s and 4 km / s . at a binary fraction of 1.0 the measurements of a small sub - sample and the measurements of all stars barely agree within the error bars any more . note that the mean value can be as large as 10 times the true newtonian velocity dispersion without binaries .",
    "moreover , from comparing fig .",
    "[ sigma_5kms ] to fig .",
    "[ sigma_10kms ] we see that the measured velocity dispersion depends strongly on the velocity window which we allow .",
    "we tend to increasingly overestimate the true velocity dispersion by increasing the size of the allowed velocity window . +   + in fig .",
    "[ sigma_ms ] the velocity dispersion measurements are shown for the mass segregated clusters . the plot shows the velocity dispersion measurements for a cluster of @xmath28 without binaries , as seen in fig .",
    "[ sigma_all]-[sigma_10kms ] but for a mass segregation degree , @xmath27 , varying from 0 to 0.95 . from the figure",
    "we see that mass segregation increases the velocity dispersion further .",
    "the segregated cluster ( @xmath37 ) has a 20 per cent higher velocity dispersion than the unsegregated case ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that through mass segregation the heaviest stars ( which we observe for the velocity dispersion ) move to the cluster centre , and that stars on average move at higher velocities when they are in the cluster centre .",
    "when a sample of observed stars was concentrated on the centre of the cluster and was not well distributed over the cluster , we would get the same effect .",
    "@xcite have determined the velocity dispersion of pal  14 according to @xcite , i.e. have made a maximum - likelihood estimation , which is , of course , necessary as unlike in our samples the measurement errors of their radial velocities are all different . from their sample of 17 stars",
    "they find one star ( star 15 ) to lie 3 @xmath29 off the mean value , and thus split their investigation into two parts : one with taking star 15 into account and one without taking star 15 into account .",
    "for the sample with star 15 they find a velocity dispersion of ( 0.64@xmath390.15 ) km / s , and without star 15 they find ( 0.38@xmath390.12 ) km / s .",
    "+   + based on a kolmogorov - smirnov test , @xcite argue that star 15 is most likely not a regular member of pal  14 , i.e. a foreground contamination or part of a long - period binary system .",
    "thus , at the bottom line they favour the lower value of 0.38 km / s . +   + from fig .",
    "[ sigma_all ] we see that such a low velocity dispersion would imply that the binary fraction of pal  14 was less than 0.1 . with taking star 15 into account the velocity dispersion of pal  14",
    "would imply a binary fraction of less than 0.2 . +   + in fig .",
    "[ sigma_5kms ] the velocity dispersion derived from a sub - sample of 17 stars within a velocity interval of @xmath34 km / s shows that the lower value of 0.38 km / s would be consistent within the error bars with values less than @xmath40 , while the higher value of 0.64 km / s would be consistent with values less than @xmath41 .",
    "allowing for @xmath36 km / s reduces the latter to @xmath11 less than 0.3 ( fig .",
    "[ sigma_10kms ] ) . +   + from fig .",
    "[ sigma_ms ] we see that mass segregation does not help in understanding the low observational value of pal  14 s velocity dispersion , since mass segregation tends to increse the observed velocity dispersion of a cluster by up to 20 per cent compared to the unsegregated case . on the contrary , since pal  14 is supposed to be mass segregated @xcite , its velocity dispersion may be even inflated .",
    "our previous estimates on pal  14 s binary fraction therefore have to be taken as upper limits .",
    "from our test of the observed velocity dispersion of the milky - way globular cluster pal  14 , we have seen that the binary fraction within pal  14 has to be less than 0.2 in the case of star 15 not being considered a member , in order to be consistent with a velocity dispersion as low as ( 0.38@xmath390.12 ) km / s . with taking star 15 into account the maximum binary fraction consistent with the observational uncertainties",
    "is about 0.4 .",
    "this poses a number of questions on the nature of pal  14 .",
    "+   + as a first explanation of these findings we may assume that the binary fraction within pal  14 is indeed as low as found .",
    "but , as stated above , the density within pal  14 is as low as 0.1 - 0.2 stars / pc@xmath1 .",
    "the effect of disruption of binaries due to dynamical stellar evolution within its age of about 11.5 gyr is therefore negligible and we even may see here the primordial binary population of a globular cluster @xcite .",
    "thus , the formation of pal  14 must have been significantly different from what is observed in all other star forming sites today . or pal  14 must have undergone a very dense and violent phase in which most of the binaries were burned , but as we can see in the onc today , this is very unlikely to happen for a sufficiently long time span that the binary fraction drops below 0.5 .",
    "furthermore , such a scenario would give rise to the question how pal  14 could have expanded that much , as with a half - light radius of about 34 pc it is one of the most expanded globular clusters of the milky way today .",
    "recent numerical studies moreover show that this expansion is very unlikely to be of pure dynamical origin , since expansion takes place on a relaxation time scale and the relaxation time of pal  14 is of order of a hubble time @xcite .",
    "+   + a second option would be that the binary population is normal , i.e. above 0.5 , and that thus the observed velocity dispersion has to be corrected for the effect of binaries .",
    "as we have seen , this can be as much as a factor of 10 in the case of 17 stars drawn from a cluster with a binary fraction of 1.0 .",
    "since the lower mass limit of pal  14 is determined to be about @xmath28 @xcite this would imply that the true velocity dispersion of pal  14 is much lower than the newtonian prediction , i.e. pal  14 is `` kinematically frigid '' .",
    "this would be inconsistent with our understanding of newtonian gravity and could neither be explained by considering mond to be valid in pal  14 .",
    "+   + moreover , we found that mass segregation increases the observed velocity dispersion of a cluster even further , and thus can not explain the low velocity dispersion of pal  14 .",
    "the observed , flattened mass function of pal  14 on the other hand suggests that pal  14 is significantly mass segregated @xcite .",
    "thus , its unsegregated , i.e. for the effect of mass segregation corrected , velocity dispersion may be even lower than the values reported by @xcite , which would worsen the problem .",
    "+   + thus , the present state of knowledge on pal  14 is that either its binary fraction is highly abnormal , given its low density , or that it is significantly sub - virial .",
    "the former possibility would imply a non - standard star - formation event which formed pal  14 , while the latter indicates a problem understanding the dynamics of pal  14 .",
    "+   + in any case , this investigation has shown that one has to be cautious with low velocity dispersions derived from small samples of cluster stars .",
    "the observed value from such a sub - sample tends to be significantly larger than the true velocity dispersion . this effect gets larger with increasing size of the allowed velocity window about the mean radial velocity",
    ". this could be especially important in the outer parts of star clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , as was also recently shown by @xcite .",
    "+   + more line - of - sight velocity measurements , e.g. as a 2nd epoch spectroscopic snapshot , may help to reduce the statistical uncertainties and improve the significance of findings on whether or not newtonian dynamics is valid in pal  14 ( see also @xcite ) ."
