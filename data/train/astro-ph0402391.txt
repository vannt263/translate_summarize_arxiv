    "the radio spectrum of a young supernova probes the conditions in the magnetized plasma where this radiation originates from relativistic electrons , which are believed to be accelerated in the interface region of the supernova blast - wave shock and the circumstellar medium .",
    "the radio emission from the nearby supernova sn 1993j is clearly of a non - thermal nature and is argued to be due to synchrotron radiation in a magnetic field amplified in the interaction region and affected by synchrotron self absorption and external free - free absorption ( see e.g.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the most critical parameter of the plasma which affects the synchrotron radiation spectrum , is the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "this is often estimated indirectly under assumptions of equipartition of energy between the magnetic fields and that of relativistic particles or by fitting the radio flux density and turnover wavelength . in many classical radio sources , such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) like the crab or cassiopeia a , or in luminous radio galaxies , the radio spectral index is found to steepen at high frequencies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the so called synchrotron aging of the source , as during the lifetime of the source , electrons with high enough energies in a homogeneous magnetic field will be depleted due to efficient synchrotron radiation compared with the ones with lower energies .",
    "an observation of a synchrotron break can yield a measurement of the magnetic field _",
    "independent of the equipartition argument _ if the age of the source is known ( magnetic field in the crab nebula was measured by @xcite ( as quoted in @xcite ) using this technique ) .",
    "multi - frequency radio studies of a supernova like sn 1993j , that is bright enough in the radio bands can offer such a possibility .",
    "sn 1993j exploded on march 28 , 1993 .",
    "it was the archetypal type iib supernova and provided a good opportunity to study the extragalactic supernovae in detail for being the nearest extragalactic supernova ( 3.6 mpc ) . in this paper , we discuss the near simultaneous spectrum of sn 1993j obtained by combining the gmrt low frequency data with the vla high frequency data around day 3200 since explosion .",
    "we find a steepening of the spectrum by @xmath2 at radio frequency of 4 ghz .",
    "we associate this break with the synchrotron cooling .",
    "synchrotron aging of young supernovae has been discussed by @xcite and also mentioned by @xcite .",
    "however we find the first clear observational signature of a spectral break in radio bands of the young supernova sn 1993j . with this break frequency and the independently known age of the sn 1993j , we determine the magnetic field in the supernova .",
    "moreover , we predict how this break frequency will evolve with time , based on a quasi - static evolution of the electron spectrum under the combined effect of acceleration processes , synchrotron losses and adiabatic expansion of the shell where the electrons are confined .",
    "we compare this observationally determined field with the best fit magnetic field under equipartition assumption and thence derive the fraction by which relativistic energy density deviates from magnetic energy density .",
    "we briefly describe the observations of sn1993j in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we combine the data with the vla data and explore spectral fits with and without synchrotron cooling breaks . in section 4",
    "we explore the cumulative effects of adiabatic expansion of the supernova envelope and energy gain undergone by electrons under diffusive particle acceleration upon the synchrotron cooling affected particle spectrum . in section 5",
    "we discuss the evolution of the break frequency with time and the importance of wide - band spectra for modeling .",
    "we observed sn 1993j with the giant meter - wave radio telescope in 610 and 235 mhz wavebands on 2001 december 30 and in 1420 mhz band on 2001 october 15 .",
    "we combined this dataset with the high frequency vla observations ( kindly provided by @xcite ) in 22.5 , 14.9 , 8.4 , 4.8 and 1.4 ghz wavebands observed on 2002 january 13 ( see table [ tab:1 ] for details ) .",
    "since the supernova is 10 years old , we do not expect the flux density to change by significant amount in time scale of couple of months .",
    "for example using time dependence of the flux density as @xmath3 @xcite , we find that the flux density of supernova will change by only 2% from 2001 october 15 to 2001 december 30 , i.e. the flux density of sn at 1.4 ghz which was 33.9 mjy on 2001 october 15 scaled to 33.2 mjy on 2001 december 30 .",
    "the difference is well within the errors quoted .",
    "flux calibrators 3c48 and 3c147 were observed at the beginning and at the end of the observations . in 1420 mhz observations",
    ", we used 1034 + 565 as a phase calibrator , whereas , 0834 + 555 was used as phase calibrator for 610 and 235 mhz band observations .",
    "phase calibrator was observed for 6 minutes after every 25 minutes observation on the sn .",
    "the total time spend on supernova varied from 2 hours to 4 hours .",
    "the data was analyzed using astronomical image processing software ( aips ) .",
    "the flux density errors quoted in our gmrt datasets are @xmath4}\\ ] ] the 10% of the peak flux takes into account any possible systematic errors in gmrt as well as the variation in flux in the short time difference in the near simultaneous spectrum .",
    "more details of observations , data analysis and low frequency spectra of sn 1993j at other epochs will be described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "when we try to fit the combined gmrt plus vla spectrum using synchrotron self absorption ( ssa ) @xcite or free free absorption ( ffa ) @xcite models , we find that the optically thin part of the spectrum can not be fitted with a single power law .",
    "the data suggests a steepening of spectrum towards higher frequency end and two power laws are required to fit the optically thin part of the spectrum .",
    "the normalized @xmath5 per @xmath6 for ssa with a single power - law improves significantly to @xmath7 per @xmath8 with ssa with power law with a break .",
    "we use ssa model to derive the magnetic field from the turn - over in the spectrum .",
    "the best fit magnetic field at the peak of the spectrum under equipartition assumption is @xmath9 mg and radius is @xmath10 cm .",
    "the break in the spectrum occurs at @xmath11 ghz .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the spectrum with the ssa fit with a break in the spectrum .",
    "we see that the emission spectral index @xmath12 for frequency region below 4.02 ghz is @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the particle spectral index related to @xmath12 as , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the spectral index at 4.02 ghz towards higher frequency end changes by @xmath17 , hence emission spectral index after break towards higher frequency region is @xmath18 .",
    "this variation in spectral index is roughly consistent with that predicted from the synchrotron cooling effect with continuous injection ( see @xcite ) and we attribute the break in the spectrum of sn 1993j to synchrotron cooling .",
    "the lifetime of the relativistic electrons undergoing synchrotron losses is given as @xmath19=1.43 \\times 10^{12 } b^{-3/2 } { \\nu}^{-1/2}\\ ; { \\rm sec}\\ ] ] here we use @xmath20 .",
    "the above expression is implicitly a function of time , since the magnetic field in the region of emission itself changes with time as the supernova shock moves out farther into the circumstellar plasma .",
    "the time variation of the synchrotron break frequency can be obtained by setting : @xmath21 , whence ,    @xmath22    here we use @xmath23 @xcite . from the above equation ( and using @xmath24 @xcite ) and with break frequency 4 ghz , we get magnetic field @xmath25 gauss for @xmath26 days . however this estimate of the magnetic field",
    "does not account for other processes like diffusive fermi acceleration and adiabatic losses , likely to be important for a young supernova and affecting the break frequency .",
    "diffusive fermi acceleration and adiabatic expansion processes do not result in change of slope of the energy spectrum from what it was in case of pure synchrotron losses , but the frequency where the synchrotron cooling break occurs gets shifted depending upon the strength of these two competing processes @xcite .",
    "adiabatic losses shifts the break frequency towards lower frequency with time , whereas acceleration processes shift the cooling break to higher frequencies .",
    "we derive below the magnetic field under cumulative effect of all these processes .",
    "since supernova is young and expanding rapidly , the adiabatic losses will be given by @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath28 is the expansion velocity , i.e. the ejecta velocity and @xmath29 is the radius of the spherical shell .    in supernovae",
    ", diffusive mechanism is assumed to be the main acceleration mechanism @xcite . in this process",
    "electrons gain energy every time they cross the shock front either from upstream to downstream or vice versa .",
    "the average fractional momentum gain per shock crossing or recrossing is : @xmath30 and the average time taken to perform one such cycle is @xcite , @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the test particle velocity , @xmath33 is the upstream velocity and @xmath34 is the downstream velocity , and @xmath35 is the spatial diffusion coefficient of the test particles across the ambient magnetic field , when the shock front is quasi - perpendicular to the field . in the rest frame of shock front ,",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 ( for compression factor of 4 ) .",
    "hence the rate of energy gain will be @xmath38    the break in the spectrum will occur for those electron energies for which the time scales for the cumulative rate of change of electron energy due to synchrotron cooling plus adiabatic losses and gain through diffusive acceleration becomes comparable to the life time of the supernova @xcite .",
    "lifetime of electrons for the cumulative energy loss rate is @xmath39 where first term in the denominator is synchrotron loss term with @xmath40 . setting the life time @xmath41 , break frequency can be derived as : @xmath42}^2   \\,{\\rm hz}\\ ] ]    we do not yet have an observational determination of @xmath35 for sn 1993j . however in the case of sn 1987a , from the delay in the switch - on of the emission between 843 mhz and 4.8 ghz , this parameter was estimated to be @xmath43 @xmath44s@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "this is relatively independent of the density and magnetic field of the two clumps in the csm into which the sn 1987a shock was running into in the first 1500 - 1600 days .",
    "we use a slightly different @xmath46 for sn 1993j , since there is evidence that the compression ratio @xmath47 of gas or plasma across the shock in sn 1993j is higher than that of sn 1987a.$ ] ; which gives @xmath48 in case of sn 1993j in contrast to @xmath49 for sn 1987a @xcite . ]",
    "therefore , we estimate that @xmath35 for sn 1993j is ( scaled by the higher compression ratio in sn 1993j ) : @xmath50 @xmath44s@xmath45 i.e. @xmath51 @xmath44s@xmath45 . from vlbi observations @xcite ,",
    "the extrapolated angular radius of sn 1993j on day 3200 is @xmath52 i.e. @xmath53 cm . using @xmath35 and r in eq .",
    "[ synchr_freq ] we find magnetic field @xmath54 gauss , from the observationally determined break .    from our ssa best fit to the radio spectrum , we have a value of the best fit equipartition magnetic field @xmath55 mg . if @xmath56 is the ratio between relativistic electron energy density , @xmath57 , to magnetic energy density , @xmath58 , ( @xmath59 ) , then magnetic field @xmath60 depends on equipartition factor @xmath56 as @xmath61 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we get equipartition fraction @xmath56 i.e. @xmath62 . this small value of the ratio of particle energy density vs magnetic energy density indicates that the plasma kinetics is dominated by magnetic field and associated turbulence .",
    "we see in the last section that the magnetic field calculated from the break in the spectral index is @xmath63 gauss , which is @xmath641.4 times higher than that expected from an extrapolation of @xcite ( @xmath65 gauss at day 3200 ) .",
    "if we took only the synchrotron cooling effect and neglected adiabatic expansion and diffusive fermi acceleration , we get magnetic field @xmath25 gauss , which is in closer agreement with that of @xcite .",
    "however , at this young age of the supernova the effects of adiabatic expansion and diffusive fermi acceleration are likely to be significant as seen in sn1987a @xcite and hence these effects should not be neglected .",
    "one can estimate the importance of the diffusive acceleration term , if one is able to follow how the break frequency evolves with time . in eq .",
    "[ synchr_freq ] , first term is the contribution of the acceleration and second term is the contribution of adiabatic expansion and synchrotron losses .",
    "we note that for the estimated value of @xmath35 at the present epoch , diffusive fermi acceleration dominates and will continue to dominate over the adiabatic losses until about 20 years since explosion .",
    "therefore , at present epoch the break frequency evolves as @xmath66 .",
    "after 20 years when the acceleration will cease to dominate over adiabatic expansion and the break frequency will increase as : @xmath67 .    since we do not have an independent method to estimate the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath35 for sn 1993j , we have used the linearly scaled ( by the respective compression ratios , @xmath47 ) value of @xmath35 measured for sn 1987a from direct radio observations ( see @xcite )",
    "however , we can directly calculate the value of @xmath35 from the ( measurable ) rate of change of @xmath68 , i.e. from the expression : @xmath69\\left[-\\frac{r^2 } { 20 { \\kappa}_{\\perp}}t^{-3/2}\\,-2\\,t^{-1/2}\\right ] { \\rm hz / sec}\\ ] ] for the present epoch and with the estimated parameters as above , we calculate that the break frequency is changing at the rate of 1.2 ghz / year .",
    "thus a few more multi - frequency spectral observations across gmrt and vla bands , separated by a few years , will observationally determine the temporal variation in the break frequency and underline the importance of the diffusive acceleration effects .",
    "the combination of multi - frequency radio spectrum across gmrt and vla bands is critical for deriving the above results . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show a comparison of synchrotron self absorption model ( with a single optically - thin power - law index ) fitted only to the low frequency data ( 0.22 ghz to 1.4 ghz ) versus such a model fit obtained with only the higher frequency data ( 1.4 ghz to 22.5 ghz ) .",
    "this comparison shows that while the model fitted only to the low frequencies over - predicts the flux density at high frequencies , the model fitted only to high frequencies on the other hand fails to account for both synchrotron cooling break and seriously under - predicts the low frequency flux densities .",
    "the comparison underscores the importance of broad band observations for determining the physical processes taking place in the supernova .",
    "we note the uncertainity in @xmath35 for sn 1993j as also emphasised by the referee who suggests that @xmath35 may not be a constant , and points out a paper due to @xcite .",
    "this paper _ assumes _ that @xmath35 is proportional to the particle energy .",
    "this dependence may affect the determination of the magnetic field ( see eq .",
    "[ synchr_freq ] ) .",
    "only future observations of the break frequency evolution with time will directly put constraints on @xmath35 for sn 1993j .",
    "we also note that our results are based on the assumption that the acceleration and synchrotron losses are taking place in the same region .",
    "however , if the regions of the two processes are not substantially overlapping , the synchrotron break frequency will not be affected by acceleration . even in that case ,",
    "the magnetic field is much higher than the equipartiton magnetic field and the plasma is still dominated by the magnetic energy density .",
