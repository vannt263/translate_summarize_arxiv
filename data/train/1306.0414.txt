    "most quantum textbooks begin their exposition by postulating that to every physical system corresponds an abstract mathematical object a ray in hilbert space called the _ quantum state_. but does the quantum state correspond to a real physical property of the system ?",
    "a major reason for doubting is that the quantum state can not be observed directly .",
    "indeed it can only be reconstructed indirectly by carrying out measurements on ensembles of identically prepared systems @xcite .",
    "alternatively the quantum state could represent only an observer s knowledge of the physical system , rather than a physical reality .",
    "such an epistemic interpretation of the quantum state could provide an intuitive explanation for many quantum phenomena , such as the measurement postulate and wavefunction collapse @xcite .",
    "harrigan and spekkens formulated with precision the above alternatives @xcite .",
    "their starting point is the assumption that every quantum system possesses a real physical state , generally called the ontic state , denoted @xmath1 .",
    "the ontic state determines the probabilities of measurement outcomes . when an ensemble of systems is prepared , different members of the ensemble may be in different ontic states @xmath1 .",
    "a preparation procedure @xmath2 is therefore associated to a probability distribution @xmath3 over the ontic states .",
    "when a measurement is carried out on a system in ontic state @xmath1 , the probability to obtain outcome @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "therefore if preparation @xmath2 is followed by measurement @xmath6 the probability of outcome @xmath4 is @xmath7 these models reproduce the predictions of quantum theory if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the quantum operator corresponding to the outcome @xmath4 and @xmath10 is the quantum state assigned by quantum theory to the preparation @xmath2 .",
    "following @xcite one can distinguish two classes of models .",
    "a model is @xmath0__-ontic _ _ if the preparation of distinct pure quantum states always gives rise to distinct real states .",
    "that is , for every @xmath1 either @xmath11 or @xmath12 if the preparations @xmath2 and @xmath13 correspond to different quantum states @xmath14 .",
    "every real state @xmath1 is thus compatible with a unique pure quantum state .",
    "the quantum state is `` encoded '' in @xmath1 and we can consider it to represent a real property of the system .",
    "a model is @xmath0__-epistemic _ _ if the preparation of distinct pure quantum states may result in the same real state @xmath1 .",
    "that is , there exist preparations @xmath2 and @xmath13 corresponding to non - identical quantum states @xmath14 such that both @xmath15 and @xmath16 for some @xmath1 . in this case , the quantum state is not uniquely determined by the underlying real state .",
    "a consistent formulation of @xmath0-epistemic models would constitute a conceptual revolution of quantum mechanics .",
    "however it was recently shown that @xmath0-epistemic models that obey certain natural conditions can not reproduce the predictions of quantum theory .",
    "pusey , barrett , and rudolph ( pbr ) showed that @xmath0-epistemic models can not reproduce the predictions of quantum theory if they satisfy the property , termed _ preparation independence _",
    ", that independently prepared pure quantum states correspond to product distributions over ontic states @xcite .",
    "a similar result was obtained in @xcite using a simple argument that relies on a natural assumption of continuity .",
    "furthermore , the approach of @xcite shows that even for a single quantum system @xmath0-epistemic models are strongly constrained .",
    "these results show that @xmath0-epistemic models that reproduce the predictions of quantum theory must be both strongly discontinuous and assign a collective ontic state to independently prepared systems . a toy @xmath0-epistemic model that reproduces the predictions of quantum theory and that satisfies these constraints",
    "was exhibited in @xcite .",
    "additional recent theoretical results presenting no - go theorems for classes of @xmath0-epistemic models have been reported in @xcite .",
    "all these no - go theorems suggest the possibility of novel experiments in the foundations of quantum mechanics . here",
    "we report an experiment that tests the existence of the continuous @xmath0-epistemic models studied in @xcite . simultaneously with our work , an experimental test of @xmath0-epistemic models based on the original pbr no - go theorem using two ions in the same trap was reported in @xcite .",
    "the interest of basing the experimental test on the no - go theorem of @xcite is that continuous @xmath0-epistemic models make predictions that are in conflict with quantum theory already at the level of a single system .",
    "this greatly facilitates experimental tests .",
    "( constraints on @xmath0-epistemic models at the level of a single system were derived independently in @xcite , see the appendix of @xcite for the relation between the two approaches ) .",
    "our experiment uses attenuated coherent states of light traveling in an optical fibre .",
    "the coherent state is decomposed into time bins , which provide convenient realisations of high - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "specifically we test the predictions of epistemic models in dimensions @xmath17 . due to non - ideal state preparation ( uncontrolled phase drifts of the laser used ) and non - ideal measurements ( losses and detector inefficiency )",
    ", our experiment suffers from `` loopholes '' .",
    "that is , the observed data could be explained by continuous epistemic models that exploit these loopholes .",
    "we argue that if the continuous epistemic model satisfies some reasonable additional hypotheses , then it can not exploit these loopholes .",
    "for instance in the case of detection loophole , we have to make an assumption similar to the fair - sampling assumption often made in non - locality experiments . and in the case of uncertainty in the preparation procedure",
    ", we must make the hypothesis that the ontic state does not depend on whether or not control measurements are included in the preparation procedure .",
    "our experimental results are in agreement with the predictions of quantum theory and provide constraints on @xmath0-epistemic models that satisfy these additional constraints .",
    "more precisely , we parameterize @xmath0-epistemic models by two parameters , @xmath18 that describes how continuous the model is , and @xmath19 that describes how epistemic it is . our experimental results rule out a large class of models labeled by these two parameters .",
    "as our experiment is based on @xcite , we recall the relevant results .",

    "recall that according to the definition of @xmath0-ontic and @xmath0-epistemic models , we assign an ontic status to @xmath0 if a variation of @xmath0 necessarily implies a variation of the underlying reality @xmath1 , and we assign it an epistemic status if a variation of @xmath0 does not necessarily imply a variation of the reality @xmath1 .",
    "it is then natural to assume a form of continuity for @xmath0-epistemic models : a slight change of @xmath0 induces a slight change in the corresponding ensemble of @xmath1 s , in such a way that at least some @xmath1 s from the initial ensemble will also belong to the perturbed ensemble .",
    "the above is a slightly stronger form of continuity which asserts that there are real states @xmath1 in the initial ensemble that will remain part of the perturbed ensemble , no matter how we perturb the initial state , provided this perturbation is small enough .",
    "if @xmath0-epistemic models reproduce the predictions of quantum theory , then there is a fundamental constraint on their @xmath20-continuity .",

    "power fluctuations of the laser are less than 0.4db in 10hours , and side lobes are rejected by more than 63db .",
    "this guarantees that within the time interval used to produce the train of pulses the source emits a coherent state of well - defined photon mean number .",
    "we then create a pulse train from the cw laser output using an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "trains of @xmath72 pulses with one missing are thus created .",

    "drives the aom .",
    "the aom is turned on for 100ns and then off for 200ns .",

    "an overall attenuation of up to 120db with an absolute precision of 0.1db and a repeatability of 0.01db can be achieved .",
    "the mean number of photons in the pulse train is @xmath74 . to complete the state preparation phase",
    ", the light is sent through a fibre spool long enough to store the complete pulse train .",
    "the photons are detected with a superconducting single - photon detector ( sspd from scontel ) cooled to @xmath75k with overall efficiency ( including losses in optical components after the state preparation and data acquisition inefficiency ) @xmath76 and dark - count rate @xmath77hz",
    ". the dark - count rate can be measured with high precision , but it is sensitive to environmental conditions ( temperature of the detectors , ambient light ) that fluctuate during the experiment , which is the reason the quoted error is large .",
    "the data acquisition is realised by a time - to - digital - converter ( agilent acqiris system ) .",

    "the mean number of photons is chosen to be @xmath87 for all dimensions @xmath72 investigated .    because the states prepared in our experiment",

    "the latter are significantly more common than the detections .",
    "indeed , use of coherent states with @xmath74 and overall detection efficiency of approximately @xmath93 ( see section  [ sec : setup ] ) yields an overall probability of registering a click of approximately @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the event that the detector clicks in one of the time bins .",
    "these no - click events affect the interpretation of the experiment . to understand why , remember that the key point of theorem  1 was showing that if there is an ontic state that occurs with positive probability for all states @xmath46 ,",
    "then one finds a contradiction with quantum theory .",
    "but in the presence of no - click events this contradiction no longer holds .",
    "indeed there exists a trivial @xmath0-epistemic model that explains our experimental results in which the ontic states common to all preparations @xmath88 only give rise to no - click events .",
    "furthermore , the vacuum component of the states @xmath88 affects the interpretation of their mutual scalar product ( since states that are almost orthogonal become arbitrarily close to each other when superposed with a sufficiently large vacuum component that does not contribute to the click events ) .",

    "the exact way @xmath18 acts on the two and more photon space is not essential for the argument ( since the overlap of the states we consider with the two and more photon space is small ) .",

    "whether the quantum wavefunction is a real physical wave or a summary of our knowledge about a physical system is a question that has divided physicists since the inception of quantum theory .",
    "a precise formulation of these two alternatives , opening the way to clear - cut answers , was provided by harrigan and spekkens @xcite : if the wavefunction corresponds to a real , ontic , property of physical systems , the preparation of a system in different pure quantum states should always result in different physical states .",
    "if , on the other hand , the wavefunction has an epistemic status , such preparations should sometimes result in the same underlying physical state .",
    "following the breakthrough of pbr @xcite , a flurry of no - go theorems for @xmath0-epistemic models obeying natural constraints have recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "these no - go theorems inspire novel experimental tests . here , we reported a test of @xmath0-epistemic model based on the argument introduced in @xcite .",
    "there are two main motivations to perform such experiments .",
    "first , given that there are good reasons to support an epistemic view of the quantum state @xcite , the no - go theorems provide new directions in which to look for potential deviations from the expected quantum predictions .",
    "our experimental results do not exhibit any such deviations , therefore strengthening our belief in the validity of quantum theory .",
    "a second , related , motivation for performing an implementation of the no - go theorems is to rule out experimentally ( certain classes of ) @xmath0-epistemic models , in the same way that the violations of bell inequalities rule out locally - causal models .",
    "however , while such experiments have some common features with a bell test , they also differ from it in several ways . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "let us first consider the case of an ideal experiment free of experimental errors and noise .",
    "the proof of theorem  1 tells us that if we prepare a system according to @xmath44 possible procedures @xmath23 and subject it to a measurement @xmath6 , then the observed value @xmath194 provides a constraint on the extent @xmath19 to which the distributions over real states associated to each preparation overlap . in particular , if @xmath195 then no common real state @xmath1 can be associated to all the preparations @xmath23 .",
    "this conclusion is obtained independently of what specific states ( pure or mixed ) are used , or what specific measurements are performed .",
    "it only depends on the observed measurement statistics , as does the violation of a bell inequality .",
    "however contrary to bell inequalities , the observation of a value @xmath196 does not per se imply that some  intrinsically quantum \" or ",
    "non - classical \" behaviour has been produced in the experiment .",
    "indeed , the quantity @xmath197 has not been introduced to distinguish between a  classical \" and a  quantum \" worldview ( as in bell inequalities ) , but between @xmath0-ontic and @xmath0-epistemic models .",
    "thus for instance the @xmath0-epistemic model presented in @xcite perfectly reproduces all predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "furthermore , the statistics of an experimental test of @xmath0-ontic versus @xmath0-epistemic models could very easily be reproduced using purely classical states .",
    "for instance the use of @xmath44 classical states of the form @xmath198 instead of the states @xmath46 in theorem  1 would also yield a value of @xmath196 .",
    "however , because these states are not pure , this experiment would not exclude @xmath0-epistemic models .",
    "this shows that when carrying out an experimental test of @xmath0-ontic versus @xmath0-epistemic models , the kind of preparation procedures used in the experiment matters to its interpretation .",
    "indeed , a @xmath0-epistemic model does not need to predict different results than quantum theory for all preparation procedures ( for instance not for those associated to the purely - classical distributions @xmath199 over orthogonal states mentioned above ) , but only for those corresponding to pure quantum states that are sufficiently close ( within distance @xmath20 in the case of @xmath20-continuous models ) . a meaningful test of @xmath20-continuous @xmath0-epistemic models",
    "must therefore be based on two components : the measurement of @xmath197 and a reasonable confidence that preparations corresponding to pure quantum states within distance @xmath20 have been used .",
    "this should be contrasted with bell experiments that are `` device independent '' : their interpretation are independent of the details of the state preparation and measurement procedures .    in this later respect ,",
    "our experiment has some specific weaknesses related to the experimental system used ( photonic time bins obtained by chopping and attenuating a cw laser ) .",
    "first , the use of coherent states that have a non - zero vacuum component and inefficient detectors resulting in no - click events require , to reach meaningful conclusions , the use of a fair - sampling assumption , a redefinition of the continuity parameter @xmath18 , and a redefinition of the quantity @xmath200 .",
    "second , we need an additional hypothesis on the epistemic model to ensure that the preparation used in the experiment yields ( approximatively ) pure coherent quantum states with a known overlap ( see discussion in section  [ sec : mixed ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that we did not explicitly check the actual performance of the preparation procedure by , e.g. , performing a direct measurement of @xmath18 .",
    "such a verification would have required the use of a complex interferometer , and could have been performed only for very small dimension .",
    "our approach was to use the very well understood physics of lasers operating well above threshold as a basis for modeling the quantum states produced by our preparation procedure .",
    "this allowed us to probe states in a much higher dimensional hilbert space , and therefore small values of the continuity parameter @xmath18 , than would have been possible otherwise .",
    "taking into account all the above constraints , our experiment nevertheless excludes , with a high degree of confidence , a large class of @xmath0-epistemic models .",
    "these @xmath0-epistemic models are labeled by two parameters , @xmath18 that describes how continuous the model is , and @xmath19 that describes how epistemic it is .",
    "our experimental results exclude a region in the @xmath155 plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon2 ] .",
    "simultaneously with our work , an experimental test of @xmath0-epistemic models based on the original pbr no - go theorem using two ions in the same trap was reported in @xcite .",
    "both experiments exclude ( possibly different ) classes of @xmath0-epistemic models .",
    "both experiments require specific additional hypotheses to ensure that the prepared states are pure quantum states with desired properties ( as discussed in the above paragraphs and in @xcite ) .",
    "such additional hypotheses will probably be needed in any experimental test of @xmath0-epistemic models .",
    "we thank anonymous referees for useful comments .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the european union under project qcs , from the frs - fnrs under project diqip , and from the brussels - capital region through a bb2b grant .",
    "in this section we adopt an approach different from that followed in section  [ sec : detection ] of the main text .",
    "there are many different physical implementations of single - photon detectors which would give the same response to incoming light as the sspd used in the experiment .",
    "our main assumption is that for a given ontic state @xmath1 the probabilities of outcomes are independent of how the detector is implemented , provided it gives the same measurement statistics as the actual one .",
    "this obviously constitutes a strong assumption on the behaviour of @xmath0-epistemic models .",
    "its interest is that it allows us to keep the same continuity condition as in the main text , contrary to the reasoning in section  [ sec : detection ] .",
    "we suppose that the interaction of the detector with the electromagnetic field obeys photon - number superselection rule .",
    "that is , the excitations in the superconducting wire depend on the quanta of energy ( or photon number ) and not on the relative phases . with this hypothesis the response of the sspd",
    "should be very well approximated by an ideal detector consisting of three steps :    1 .",
    "a beam splitter , one arm of which absorbs a fraction @xmath201 of the coherent light , where @xmath176 is the efficiency of the actual detector ; 2 .   the beam splitter is followed by a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) detector which measures the photon number ( the result of this measurement is not provided to the experimenter ) ; 3 .   the state at the output of the qnd measurement is sent to a perfect single - photon detector with 100% efficiency and dark - count rate @xmath202 which provides as output the first time bin in which a photon is detected .",
    "such a model for a single - photon detector is standard in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "note that the actual sspd may differ slightly from the above idealisation ( for instance the attenuation may not be linear ) .",
    "such small changes could be implemented by changing slightly the model , and do not affect our conclusions .    from the point of view of quantum theory ,",
    "step 1 results in the preparation of an attenuated coherent state with photon mean number @xmath169 , and step 2 results in the preparation of a mixture @xmath203 of states @xmath204 with photon number @xmath205 , if the initial state was @xmath88 .",
    "note that the states @xmath204 are pure states . in particular the state @xmath206 , where @xmath46 corresponds to the state given in the main text",
    "now we make the assumption that , from the point of view of @xmath0-epistemic models , steps 1 and 2 can be thought of as additional state preparation steps .",
    "that is , the outcome of these steps is the preparation of a new ontic state @xmath207 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the ontic distribution corresponding to a statistical mixture @xmath203 of states @xmath204 is of the form @xmath208 . with these assumptions",
    ", we have the following identity for the predictions of @xmath0-epistemic models : @xmath209 where @xmath205 is the result of the qnd measurement and @xmath210 is the probability for the qnd measurement of detecting @xmath211 photons ( in the last line we retain only the term @xmath211 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath212 component in line 2 only contributes through the effect of dark counts .",
    "we now restrict our analysis to @xmath0-epistemic models associated to the single - photon states @xmath213 .",
    "we assume @xmath20-continuity of @xmath0-epistemic models ( using the definition given in the main text ) .",
    "if the states @xmath213 are @xmath20-close , then we have the bound @xmath214 , as in the main text .",
    "in summary the assumptions made above lead to the bound @xmath215 this is the same bound as obtained in the main text , except for the factor @xmath216 ( where we take into account that @xmath217 and neglect dark counts ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : mixed ] , the presence of additional parameters @xmath139 arising from phase fluctuations of the laser increases the distance @xmath18 with the reference state .",
    "the increase in distance is obtained from the following expressions ( which we first give for the case where the state contains one photon ) : @xmath218\\right|^2 & \\simeq & 1-\\frac{1}{d}-\\frac{d \\delta\\varphi^2}{4 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath219 is the expectation over the random phases @xmath220 , and we give the leading order effect of the random phases ( for @xmath44 large and @xmath221 small ) .",
    "we thus find @xmath222 = 1-\\sqrt{(d-1)/d}+\\frac{d\\delta\\varphi^2}{8 } \\ , .\\ ] ] now we insert this expression into eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatilde ] ) to obtain @xmath223 & = & 1-e_\\varphi\\left[|\\langle\\tilde\\alpha_{k,\\{\\varphi_j\\}}|\\tilde\\alpha_0\\rangle|\\right ] \\\\ & = & 1-\\frac{e^{\\alpha^2\\sqrt{(d-1)/d } } \\left(1-\\alpha^2\\frac{d \\delta\\varphi^2}{8}\\right ) -1}{e^{\\alpha^2}-1 } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this expression we see that @xmath165 $ ] reaches a minimum when @xmath224 . for larger @xmath44 ,",
    "the distance @xmath20 between the states is dominated by the random phases , rather than the presence or absence of time bin @xmath66 .",
    "this is indeed what is observed by using the exact numerical method in the main text .",
