    "in @xcite joyce and matveev introduced the algebraic structures known as _ quandles _ or _ distributive groupoids_. in particular , the _ fundamental quandle _ of an oriented classical knot was shown to determine the knot group and the peripheral subgroup and thus the knot complement up to homeomorphism , yielding a complete invariant of oriented classical knots . in @xcite quotients of the fundamental quandle , including the fundamental involutory quandle and the fundamental involutory abelian quandle were studied , including some connections to the alexander invariant . in particular",
    ", joyce showed that the fundamental involutory abelian quandle of a knot is always finite with cardinality equal to the determinant of the knot , while winker showed that some knots have infinite involutory ( non - abelian ) quandle .",
    "in this paper we consider some quotients of the fundamental quandles of classical and virtual knots and describe an algorithm which can sometimes reveal when a quotient of the fundamental quandle of a knot is finite",
    ". showing that a given quotient is infinite is harder for general quotient quandles , but is simpler for quotients of the fundamental alexander quandle of a knot , which has a module structure .",
    "we introduce the _ fundamental latin alexander quandle _ of a knot , a generalization of the alexander quandle with coefficients in an extension ring such that the resulting quandle is latin . from this new structure",
    "we define grbner basis - valued invariants akin to those defined in @xcite .",
    "we include an example which shows that the new invariant is not determined by the generalized alexander polynomial for virtual knots .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ q ]",
    "we review the basics of quandles . in section [ qfq ]",
    "we consider some quotients of the fundamental quandle . in section [ flaq ]",
    "we define the fundamental latin alexander quandle and the fundamental latin alexander grbner ( flag ) invariants , including computations of the @xmath0 invariant for all classical knots with up to eight crossings .",
    "we end in section [ qfr ] with some questions for future research .",
    "we begin with a definition ( see @xcite ) .    it is a straightforward exercise to show that @xmath1 forms a quandle under the dual quandle operation and that the two operations mutually right - distribute , i.e. , we have @xmath2    [ ex : f8 ]    say a relation in a quandle presentation is _ short _ if it has the form @xmath3 for @xmath4 generators .",
    "then we observe that every finitely presented quandle @xmath1 has a presentation in which every relation is short , since we can add new generators @xmath5 and short form relations abbreviating subwords of the form @xmath6 to @xmath5 as needed until all relations are short . if our generators are numbered @xmath7 , then we can express a short form presentation with a matrix whose row @xmath8 column @xmath9 entry is @xmath10 if @xmath3 and @xmath11 otherwise ; we will call this a _ presentation matrix _ for @xmath1 . if a presentation matrix for @xmath1 has no zeros",
    ", then it expresses the complete operation table for @xmath1 , and @xmath1 is a finite quandle .",
    "knot quandles are generally infinite . however , it is observed in @xcite and later in @xcite that the _ involutory _ version of the fundamental quandle of a knot is often finite , and the fundamental _ abelian involutory quandle _ of a knot is always finite with order equal to the determinant of the knot , i.e. the absolute value of the alexander polynomial evaluated at @xmath12 .",
    "the fundamental involutory quandle of a knot can be understood as the result of adding a fourth axiom which says    * @xmath13 for all @xmath14    or equivalently , replacing the second quandle axiom with    * @xmath15 for all @xmath14 ;    the fundamental abelian involutory quandle is then obtained by adding an additional axiom which says    * @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "we can verify that the fundamental involutory quandle of the figure eight knot is finite with cardinality 5 by observing that moves of the following types do not change the quandle presented by a presentation matrix :    * filling in a zero with a value obtained as a consequence of the axioms and other relations , * filling in a zero with a number defining a new generator and adding a row and column of zeroes corresponding to the new generator * deleting a row and column and replacing all instances of the larger generator with the smaller one when two generators are found to be equal , taking care to note any new equalities of generators implied .",
    "this gives us an algorithm for filling in the complete operation table of a finitely presented quandle : first , fill in all zeroes determined by consequences of the axioms and keep a list of any pairs of equal generators , reducing the presentation by eliminating redundant generators when possible .",
    "next , if any zeroes remain , choose one to assign to a new generator and repeat the process .",
    "this procedure may or may not terminate ",
    "if the presented quandle is infinite , the process can never terminate , but even if the quandle finite then the speed of termination depends a great deal on the choice of zeroes for replacement . on the other hand , when the process does terminate , the result is a sequence of tietze moves showing that the presented quandle is finite .",
    "[ ex : f82 ]    the involutory and abelian conditions have geometric motivations : the involutory condition comes from considering unoriented knots , while the abelian condition is the condition required for the set of quandle homomorphisms from the knot quandle to @xmath1 to inherit a natural quandle structure ( see @xcite for more ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can consider these quotient quandles to be simply the result of imposing algebraic conditions on the fundamental quandle of a knot .",
    "any such choice of conditions results in a quandle - valued knot invariant , and for each such invariant we can ask whether the resulting quandle is finite . in @xcite the generalizations of the involutory condition to higher numbers of operations , e.g. @xmath18 were considered , with the notable result that the square knot and granny knot have non - isomorphic 4-quandles ( i.e. , quotients in which we set @xmath19 ) , despite having isomorphic knot groups .",
    "we considered several examples of algebraic axioms and used our procedure outlined above , implemented in ` python ` , to search for examples of knots whose fundamental quandles had finite quotients when the axioms were imposed .",
    "these included :    * _ anti - abelian axiom _ : @xmath20 , * _ left distributive axiom _ : @xmath21 * _ commutative operator axiom _ : @xmath22 * _ latin axiom _ : @xmath23    both in combination with the abelian and involutory axioms and alone .",
    "some combinations are redundant ; for instance , the abelian condition implies left distributivity .",
    "curiously , we found that many of the above conditions yield the same results , with most knots of small crossing number having either trivial one - element quotient quandles or the three - element quandle structure @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "recall that a _",
    "virtual knot _ is an equivalence class of oriented gauss codes under the equivalence relation determined by the gauss code reidemeister moves .",
    "it is standard practice to draw virtual knots with extra _ virtual crossings _ , circled self - intersections representing non - planarity of gauss codes ; these virtual crossings interact with classical crossings via the _ detour move _ , @xmath26 which says we can redraw any arc with only virtual crossings in its interior as any other arc with only virtual crossings in its interior .",
    "virtual knots may be understood as equivalence classes of knots in thickened oriented surfaces @xmath27 $ ] modulo stabilization .",
    "see @xcite for more about virtual knots .",
    "let @xmath28 be a virtual knot .",
    "the _ fundamental involutory virtual quandle _ of @xmath28 is the virtual quandle with presentation consisting of one generator for each portion of @xmath28 containing only overcrossings ( that is , we divide @xmath28 at classical undercrossings and at virtual crossings ) with relations as pictured together with the involutory quandle axioms . @xmath29",
    "let @xmath28 be a knot or link .",
    "the _ fundamental alexander quandle _",
    "@xmath31 is the @xmath32-module generated by generators corresponding to arcs in a diagram of @xmath28 with alexander quandle operations at the crossings . as a @xmath32-module , the fundamental alexander quandle of a knot is the classical alexander invariant .",
    "let @xmath33 be a polynomial ring and @xmath34 an @xmath33-module with presentation matrix @xmath35 , i.e. the rows of @xmath36 correspond to generators of @xmath34 and the rows of @xmath36 express relations defining @xmath34 .",
    "the _ @xmath10th elementary ideal _",
    "@xmath37 of @xmath34 is the ideal in @xmath33 generated by the @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 if @xmath40 ) minors of @xmath36 .",
    "it is a standard result ( see @xcite for instance ) that changes to @xmath36 reflecting tietze moves in the presentation of @xmath34 do not change the elementary ideals , and hence these ideals are invariants of @xmath34 .",
    "recall that a quandle is _ latin _ if in addition to the right - invertibility required by quandle axioms 2 , we also have left - invertibility .",
    "that is , a quandle @xmath1 is latin if it satisfies the axiom    * for every @xmath14 , there is a unique @xmath41 such that @xmath42    or equivalently    * for every @xmath43 , the map @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 is bijective .",
    "a finite quandle is latin if and only its operation table forms a latin square , i.e. if every row and column is a permutation of the elements of @xmath1 .",
    "the element @xmath46 is not invertible in @xmath32 ; its `` natural '' inverse is the laurent series @xmath47 . we prefer to stick to polynomial rings , so we define the fundamental latin alexander quandle of an oriented link @xmath48 in the following way : let @xmath49 $ ] where the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 are new formal variables , not ( yet ) inverses for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and then define the quotient ring @xmath54 .",
    "then we define the _ fundamental latin alexander quandle _ of @xmath48 , @xmath55 , to be the @xmath56-module generated by a set of generators corresponding to arcs in a diagram of @xmath48 with relations of the form @xmath57 at crossings as depicted below .",
    "equivalently , @xmath55 can be regarded as the alexander quandle of the knot with coefficients in the extension ring @xmath58 $ ] of @xmath59 $ ] .    in @xcite ,",
    "grbner basis - valued invariants of knots and link were defined from the alexander biquandle by considering the pullback ideals of the elementary ideals to a standard ( non - laurent ) polynomial ring , then taking the grbner basis of the resulting ideal with respect to a choice of monomial ordering .",
    "we can apply the same idea here to get a new grbner basis - valued invariant which we call the _ fundamental latin alexander grbner _",
    "invariant , denoted @xmath60 .",
    "the flag invariant contains in general more information that the alexander polynomial ; for instance , the number of elements of the flag basis with respect to a choice of monomial ordering , @xmath61 is an invariant of knots , while the classical alexander @xmath62 ideal is always principal for classical knots .",
    "we note that setting @xmath63 and @xmath64 in each of the polynomials in the @xmath65 ideal yields either the alexander polynomial or 0 , since this is the ideal which is set to zero when defining the alexander invariant .",
    "since the @xmath66 ideals are in general not principal , these grbner bases in general contain more information than the usual @xmath10th alexander polynomial .",
    "the flag ideals are defined for virtual knots just as for classical knots since each crossing can be considered locally .",
    "thus , we can extend the flag invariant to virtual knots in the usual way by simply ignoring virtual crossings .",
    "in this section we collect a few questions for future research .",
    "what other quotients of the fundamental quandle yield interesting finite quandles ? what is the relationship between quotients of the fundamental quandle , a variety of functorial invariant , and the homomorphism - based invariants such as the quandle counting invariant and its enhancements ? what does the cardinality of the @xmath66 invariant tell us about a knot ?"
