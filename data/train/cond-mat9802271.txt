    "quantum spin chains have been the subject of intensive study during the past seven decades @xcite .",
    "experimentally , their properties are investigated via inelastic neutron scattering on ( anti)ferromagnetic quasi one - dimensional compounds @xcite .",
    "one important quantity that holds much of the information related to such compounds is the dynamical correlation function ( dcf ) @xmath5 of two local spin operators .",
    "indeed , the neutron scattering intensity is directly proportional to it , see for example @xcite .",
    "an important feature of these chains is that some of them , like the heisenberg model , are amenable to exact theoretical treatment while still describing nontrivial interactions @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this is because they incorporate in them a rich mathematical structure : the quantum affine algebra . the early work on such models consisted in determining exactly their static thermodynamic properties , see @xcite , whereas , more recently , a fuller exploitation of the quantum symmetry using bosonization techniques has allowed for a more systematic description of their dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "a systematic account of this work is given in @xcite .    however , one aspect of these new techniques is that the exact correlation functions are usually obtained in the form of quite complicated contour integrals and this renders their manipulation somewhat cumbersome .",
    "but on the other hand , before this exact treatment , the approach to these dynamical quantities was only approximate . indeed , if one considers for instance the dcf in the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , the focus has for a long time been only on what we now know to be its two - spinon contribution @xmath4 .",
    "first there has been the anderson ( semi - classical ) spin - wave theory @xcite , an approach based on an expansion in powers of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spin of the system and hence , is exact only in the classical limit @xmath8 .",
    "it can describe with some satisfaction compounds with higher spins @xcite , but fails in the quantum limit @xmath9 .",
    "then there has been the so - called mller ansatz @xcite , which gives an approximate expression for @xmath4 that can account for many aspects of the phenomenology for @xmath9 compounds .",
    "only very recently could we get for this system a final exact expression for @xmath4 @xcite , and that gave a better account of the data @xcite .",
    "now for the spin-@xmath10 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , there is a need to go beyond the two - spinon contribution .",
    "the need is two - fold .",
    "first , it is important to see if one is able to get useful information from these complicated and compact expressions we alluded to above .",
    "second and more important perhaps is the fact that , though the exact two - spinon contribution accounts for much of the phenomenology as we said , about 70% , in a sense that will become clear later in section 3 , it still does nt account for _ all _ of it .",
    "this point is demonstrated in particular in @xcite .",
    "the natural step forward is to look into the exact four - spinon contribution . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "refs @xcite and @xcite constitute the first direct attempt in this direction . a general expression for the @xmath11-spinon contribution to the dcf in the anisotropic heisenberg model is given in @xcite and ( a still compact one ) for the isotropic limit in @xcite . in ref @xcite",
    ", we specialize to the four - spinon case and give a discussion of some of its properties in the isotropic and ising limits . in particular",
    ", we show that in the isotropic limit , the one of interest here , the exact four - spinon contribution is safe of any potential divergences .    in this work , we further the description of the four - spinon contribution @xmath12 .",
    "we determine the region in which @xmath0 is not identically zero and show that it is larger than that of @xmath4 . also , we show that the behavior of @xmath12 as a function of the neutron momentum transfer @xmath2 is similar in its overall shape to that of the corresponding @xmath4 .",
    "this result is to be contrasted with the fact that the expression of @xmath0 is a lot more involved than that of @xmath4 , see ( [ s4 ] ) and ( [ s2ex ] ) respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 heisenberg model .",
    "we describe the spinon hilbert - space structure and define the dynamical correlation function . in section 3",
    ", we succinctly review the properties of the two - spinon contribution .",
    "we give the exact expression of @xmath4 and that of the mller ansatz , and briefly compare their main features . in section 4 ,",
    "we give the exact expression of @xmath0 and discuss in detail its properties we mentioned above .",
    "the last section comprises concluding remarks .",
    "the antiferromagnetic @xmath9 @xmath1-heisenberg model is defined as the isotropic limit of the @xmath13-anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "the isotropic antiferromagnetic limit is obtained via the limit @xmath16 or equivalently @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 are the usual pauli matrices acting at the site @xmath19 the exact diagonalization directly in the thermodynamic limit of the hamiltonian in ( [ ham ] ) is possible using the @xmath20 quantum group symmetry present in the model @xcite .",
    "the resulting hilbert space @xmath21 consists of @xmath22-spinon energy eigenstates @xmath23 built on the two vacuum states @xmath24 , @xmath25 such that : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy of spinon @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a spectral parameter living on the unit circle . in the above equation , @xmath30 and the index",
    "@xmath31 refers to the boundary condition on the spin chain , see @xcite .",
    "the translation operator @xmath32 which shifts the spin chain by one site acts on the spinon eigenstates in the following manner : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the lattice momentum of spinon @xmath28 .",
    "the expressions of the spinon energy and lattice momentum in terms of the spectral parameter are quite cumbersome in the anisotropic case , see @xcite , but simplify considerably in the isotropic limit , see eq ( [ disrel ] ) below .",
    "the completeness relation in @xmath21 reads : @xmath36    the two - point dcf is the fourier transform of the zero - temperature vacuum - to - vacuum two - point function , i.e. , it is defined by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath2 are the neutron energy and momentum transfer respectively and @xmath39 denotes @xmath40 .",
    "the dcf is such that : @xmath41 the two relations that express the reflection and periodicity symmetries on the linear chain . inserting the completeness relation and using the heisenberg relation : @xmath42",
    "we can write the transverse dcf as the sum of @xmath11-spinon contributions : @xmath43 where the @xmath11-spinon dcf @xmath44 is given by : @xmath45 relation in which @xmath46 denotes the form factor : @xmath47 note that each @xmath44 must satisfy relations ( [ symdcf ] ) .",
    "the exact expression of this form factor has been determined in @xcite . using this form factor",
    ", we can give an exact expression for the @xmath11-spinon dcf in the anisotropic case , see @xcite , and determine exactly its isotropic limit , see @xcite .",
    "this limit is obtained via the replacement @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the spectral parameter suited for this limit .",
    "the expressions of the energy @xmath50 and momentum @xmath51 in terms of @xmath49 then read : @xmath52 the transverse two - spinon dcf @xmath4 does not involve a contour integration and has been given in @xcite .",
    "the four - spinon one @xmath0 involves only one contour integration and its expression is given in @xcite . in the next section , we review the properties of @xmath4 and in the one that follows it , we discuss those of @xmath0 .",
    "the exact expression of the two - spinon dcf  of the spin @xmath10 @xmath1-model is given in @xcite and reads : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the heaviside step function and the function @xmath55 is given by : @xmath56 @xmath57 is the upper ( lower )  bound of the two - spinon excitation energies called the des cloizeaux and pearson @xcite upper ( lower ) bound or limit .",
    "they read : @xmath58 the quantity @xmath59 and is related to @xmath38 and @xmath2 by the relation : @xmath60 a relation obtained using eq ( [ disrel ] ) and the energy - momentum conservation laws : @xmath61 note that the explicit expression of @xmath4 given in eq ( [ s2ex ] ) satisfies the reflection and periodicity symmetries expressed in ( [ symdcf ] ) .    the properties of @xmath4 have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "there , a comparison with the mller ansatz @xcite is given .",
    "this latter was derived from the properties of some solutions to the bethe - ansatz equations , from numerical calculations on finite spin chains and from an analysis of phenomenological results .",
    "it reads : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a constant determined in such a way to fit best the phenomenology @xcite .",
    "there are two main differences between the exact expression ( [ s2ex ] ) and the approximate one ( [ s2mul ] ) , @xcite . first , the two - spinon threshold at @xmath64 is more singular in ( [ s2ex ] )  than in ( [ s2mul ] ) .",
    "second , at the upper two - spinon boundary @xmath65 , @xmath4 vanishes smoothly whereas @xmath66 has a sharp cut - off .",
    "but if one defines the frequency moments of the dcf : @xmath67 one shows that as @xmath68 the moment of @xmath4 vanishes as : @xmath69 and the same holds for the mller ansatz @xmath66 .",
    "actually , the frequency moments ( [ fremom ] ) are particular cases of a set of sum rules the dcf is known to satisfy exactly . for exemple , we know that the first moment is exactly equal to @xcite : @xmath70 it turns out that the same frequency moment for @xmath4 is such that @xcite : @xmath71 this means that , according to this sum rule , @xmath4 is way off the total dcf @xmath5 by roughly 30% .",
    "in fact , other exact sum rules confirm this trend , see @xcite .",
    "of course , those remaining 30% are `` filled '' , so to speak , by the @xmath72-spinon contributions .",
    "the natural question that comes to mind is : how much @xmath0 takes up from these 30% ?",
    "obviously , one has first to study the behavior of this contribution before trying to answer this question , and this we do in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the analytic expression of the four - spinon dcf has been worked out in @xcite and for @xmath73 it reads : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a numerical constant and the integrand @xmath76 is given by : @xmath77 the different quantities involved in this expression are : @xmath78 the function @xmath79 is given by : @xmath80 \\ ; ,   \\label{f}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 and the function @xmath82 reads : @xmath83 where @xmath54 is the heaviside step function . in ( [ fs4 ] ) , the sum @xmath84 is over the two pairs @xmath85 and @xmath86 solutions of the energy - momentum conservation laws : @xmath87 they read : @xmath88 note that the solution in ( [ scl ] ) is allowed as long as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is given in ( [ not ] ) and : @xmath91    we henceforth put ourselves in the interval @xmath92 . to get the behavior of @xmath0 for the values of @xmath2 outside this interval , one uses the symmetry relations ( [ symdcf ] ) given in section 2 . in the work @xcite",
    ", we have discussed the behavior of the function @xmath76 given in ( [ fs4 ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the series @xmath82 is convergent .",
    "we have also shown that in the region where two @xmath93 s or more get equal , the function @xmath82 is finite .",
    "the function @xmath79 going to zero in these same regions @xcite , this means the integrand @xmath76 of @xmath0 has a nice regular behavior there .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that @xmath76 is exponentially convergent when one of the @xmath93 s goes to infinity , which means the two integrals over @xmath94 and @xmath95 in ( [ s4 ] )  do not yield infinities .",
    "all these analytic results pave the way to `` safe '' numerical manipulations .",
    "the first thing we wish to discuss in this work is the extent of the region in the @xmath96-plane in which @xmath0 is not identically zero , and compare it to that of @xmath4 .",
    "remember that from ( [ s2ex ] ) , @xmath4 is zero identically outside the spin - wave continuum @xmath97 , where @xmath98 are given in ( [ dcp ] ) . from the condition @xmath99 discussed after eq ( [ scl ] ) ,",
    "one infers that in order for @xmath0 to be nonzero identically , one has to have @xmath100 , where : @xmath101 all these branches are plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "the first thing we immediately see is that the @xmath0-region , i.e. , the region in which @xmath0 is not identically zero , is not confined to the spin - wave continuum delimited by the dcp branches @xmath102 given in ( [ dcp ] ) .",
    "this means that , a fortiori , the full @xmath5 is also not confined to the @xmath4-region .",
    "this fact is confirmed by early finite chain numerical calculations @xcite and the phenomenology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "1 shows that for @xmath103 , the @xmath0-region is entirely beyond the @xmath4-region .",
    "this means that for this interval , we may expect @xmath4 to be dominant in @xmath5 within the spin - wave continuum .",
    "however , for @xmath104 , there is overlap between the two regions such that the @xmath4-region is more or less within the @xmath0-region .",
    "we may therefore expect here the contribution of @xmath0 to play a rle , and hence , we expect @xmath4 to be a little less dominant within the spin - wave continuum .",
    "the next feature we discuss in this work is the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 for fixed @xmath38 .",
    "2a , 3a and 4a show the behavior of @xmath0 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively .",
    "note that we have scaled @xmath0 to appropriate units .",
    "2b , 3b and 4b show the behavior of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath2 for the same values of @xmath38 .",
    "let us for example discuss the case @xmath107 .",
    "we see from fig .  3b",
    "that the function @xmath4 vanishes for ( roughly )  @xmath108 .",
    "looking back into fig .  1 , this corresponds indeed to the region outside the spin - wave continum for @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 .",
    "the function @xmath4 starts at @xmath111 with a large value and goes to a minimum at @xmath112 1 .",
    "3a shows that the function @xmath0 has a somewhat similar behavior . from the figure",
    ", we read that @xmath0 too is not vanishing for ( roughly ) @xmath113 . from fig .  1 , that corresponds within the @xmath0-region to @xmath114 . but fig .",
    "1 shows also that for @xmath115 , @xmath0 may be non - vanishing in the interval @xmath116 .",
    "that contribution does nt appear on fig .",
    "3a , presumably because @xmath0 there is negligeable .",
    "this is confirmed in the case @xmath117 which is close to the case @xmath118 : there we see @xmath0 having a very small contribution in the corresponding interval . from fig .",
    "3a , we see that @xmath0 , like @xmath4 , starts from a large value at its lower boundary @xmath119 and decreases while moving to @xmath120 .",
    "the case @xmath121 is practically the same .",
    "4b shows @xmath4 starting from zero at roughly @xmath122 , getting to a maximum and sharply dropping to zero a little further .",
    "it then starts sharply again from a large value a little after @xmath123 and decreases to a minimum at @xmath120 .",
    "this is also consistent with fig .  1 :",
    "the function @xmath4 starts to be nonvanishing for @xmath121 at @xmath124 .",
    "it stays nonvanishing until @xmath125 reaches the value @xmath126 it remains identically zero until @xmath127 reaches the value @xmath128 at which we enter back into the @xmath4-region .",
    "as we said , @xmath0 has in this case too the same overall behavior as that of @xmath4 . in fig .  4a",
    ", we see that @xmath0 starts to increase from the value zero at @xmath129 .",
    "it goes quickly to a maximum before dropping sharply to zero a little before @xmath130 .",
    "it stays at zero till a little after @xmath123 and increases sharply",
    ". then it decreases while wiggling to @xmath120 .",
    "this overall behavior is also consistent with fig .  1 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath121 , the @xmath0-region starts at @xmath129 and extends first to @xmath131",
    ". then we get outside this region from this value of @xmath2 till @xmath132 .",
    "then @xmath0 is no more identically zero beyond this point until we reach the point @xmath133 .",
    "as we said , this is quite consistent with fig .",
    "in this work , we have discussed the behavior of the exact four - spinon contribution @xmath0 to the dynamical correlation function @xmath5 of the @xmath134 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model and compared it to the one of the exact two - spinon contribution @xmath4 .",
    "we first reviewed the model and the spinon structure of the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "we then gave a brief account of the results concerning @xmath4 and its comparison to the mller ansatz .",
    "the first thing concerning @xmath0 we discussed is the region in the @xmath96-plane in which @xmath0 is not identically zero .",
    "we found it to be different and larger than that of @xmath4 , i.e. , the spin - wave continuum .",
    "both regions are drawn in fig .  1 .",
    "we then discussed the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 for fixed values of @xmath38 , and compared it to the one of @xmath4 .",
    "these behaviors are plotted in figs .",
    "2,3 and 4 .",
    "we have found that the overall shape of @xmath0 is more or less the same as that of @xmath4 .",
    "the first thing to emphasize we think is the overall similarity between the shapes of @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "this is not at all expected from the outset , given the more complicated expression of @xmath0 , see ( [ s4 ] ) , as compared to that of @xmath4 , see ( [ s2ex ] ) .",
    "does this mean that the shape of the other @xmath72-spinon contributions and hence of the total @xmath5 is already more or less `` traced '' by that of @xmath4 ?",
    "we think that at this stage , it is too early for such an inference : this is a preliminary investigation into the behavior of @xmath0 and clearly more work is needed .    in any case",
    ", it would have been interesting to measure @xmath0 for other ( larger ) values of @xmath3 , especially in regions where @xmath4 is identically zero whereas @xmath0 is not , see fig .  1 .",
    "but as @xmath3 increases , the structure of the function @xmath135 of eq([fs4 ] ) in the @xmath136-plane gets `` richer '' , which means numerically harder to handle .",
    "to illustrate this point , we have plotted for the reader in figs .",
    "5 the function @xmath76 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( 5a ) , @xmath139 ( 5b ) .",
    "one can see that as @xmath3 increases , the function @xmath76 gets distributed nontrivially in larger areas in the @xmath136-plane , with an increasing more involved structure .",
    "this is the main reason why we preferred to defer the discussion of these regions to future work .",
    "also , for the same reason , we have deferred the systematic discussion of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath38 for fixed values @xmath2 .",
    "one other interesting question we havent touched on in this work but merely alluded to at the end of section 3 is the following : how much @xmath0 accounts for in the total @xmath5 ?",
    "in other words , is @xmath140 better an approximation to the total @xmath5 than @xmath4 alone , and if yes , by how much ?",
    "as we said , we know that @xmath4 accounts for about 70% of the total @xmath5 , which means that roughly 30% are left for the @xmath72-spinon contributions . to tackle this question as it should , one has to rely on a certain number of sum rules @xmath5 is known to satisfy exactly .",
    "then one compares the contribution of @xmath140 to the exact result and carries a discussion thereon .",
    "the other interesting question one may ask is the physical interpretation and implications of the behavior of the four - spinon dcf we have described in this work . what would certainly be interesting is to be able to systematically measure @xmath5 outside the spin - wave continuum so that we are assured of having the effects of the two - spinon contribution eliminated .",
