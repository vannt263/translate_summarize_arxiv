    ", this means that the detuning of the cavity field from resonance is much larger than the atomic linewidth . in the case of membranes",
    "the requirement is similar , in that we need the polarisability to be effectively constant with respect to frequency .",

    "our numerical investigations show that the major effect of absorption is not on the optomechanical coupling strength , but on the linewidth of the cavity .",

    "<S> we investigate the collective optomechanics of an ensemble of scatterers inside a fabry  prot resonator and identify an optimized configuration where the ensemble is transmissive , in contrast with the usual reflective optomechanics approach . in this configuration </S>",
    "<S> , the optomechanical coupling of a specific collective mechanical mode can be several orders of magnitude larger than the single - element case , and long - range interactions can be generated between the different elements since light permeates throughout the array . </S>",
    "<S> this new regime should realistically allow for achieving strong single - photon optomechanical coupling with massive resonators , realizing hybrid quantum interfaces , and exploiting collective long - range interactions in arrays of atoms or mechanical oscillators .    </S>",
    "<S> the field of optomechanics has made tremendous progress over the past decades  @xcite , cooling of massive mechanical oscillators to the motional quantum ground state being but one of a series of achievements that demonstrate the power of coupling light to moving scatterers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the control of mechanical motion in the quantum regime has many important applications , ranging from precision measurements  @xcite , quantum information processing  @xcite , and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics  @xcite , to the photonics sciences  @xcite . despite recent progress </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between a single photon and a single phonon remains typically very weak , therefore necessitating the use of many photons to amplify the interaction  @xcite . in this regime , which is useful for cooling and light  </S>",
    "<S> motion entanglement generation , a stronger coupling per photon is desirable to limit the negative effects of using large powers , e.g. , bulk temperature increases or phase - noise heating  @xcite . ultimately , reaching the strong ( single - photon ) coupling regime , in which a single quantum of light can appreciably affect the motion of the mechanical oscillator , is essential to exploiting fully the quantum nature of the optomechanical interaction , as exhibited by such effects as the optomechanical photon blockade  @xcite and non - gaussian mechanical states  @xcite .    among the various approaches currently followed to couple mechanical oscillators with optical resonators , a successful one involves positioning reflecting objects  dielectric membranes  @xcite , atoms  @xcite , or microspheres  @xcite  inside an optical cavity . with dielectric membranes </S>",
    "<S> the optomechanical interaction strength saturates to a fundamental limit @xmath0 as the reflectivity of the membrane approaches unity  @xcite . for a highly reflective membrane placed to the center of a fabry  prot ( fp ) resonator of length @xmath1 and resonance frequency @xmath2 , the single - photon coupling strength is given by the shift in cavity frequency when the mirror moves through a distance equal to the spread @xmath3 of its zero - point fluctuations , @xmath4 , and is typically rather weak for a macroscopic cavity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several approaches can be followed to improve quantum motional control in single membrane systems , by e.g. , tailoring of the optical and mechanical properties of the individual membranes  @xcite , using photothermal cooling forces  @xcite , active thermal noise compensation  @xcite , optical trapping  @xcite techniques , or coupling to cold atoms  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another promising approach consists in exploiting _ collective _ optomechanical interactions using microscopic ensembles of cold atoms  @xcite or arrays of macroscopic mechanical oscillators  @xcite . in </S>",
    "<S> the former the optomechanical coupling strength usually scales as @xmath5 with the number , @xmath6 , of atoms , and the weakly - coupled atomic systems are said to demonstrate infinitely long - ranged interactions  @xcite . in the latter </S>",
    "<S> , one can confine the light in periodic structures at the wavelength scale . in this vein , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , optomechanical crystals  @xcite have proven to be very successful at obtaining large coupling strengths by decreasing the length of the effective cavity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , interactions between distant elements in arrays of massive scatterers are believed to be strongly suppressed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we provide here a unifying formalism that shows these two systems as limiting cases of a more generic model for an array of scatterers in a fp cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to identify an optimized configuration for the scatterers that is transmissive instead of the typical reflective approach . </S>",
    "<S> we base our treatment on the observation that around a transmission point of the mechanical system , the cavity response to a certain collective mechanical oscillation can be greatly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be seen as an alternative to the traditional approach that requires smaller cavities ( on the order of a few wavelengths  @xcite ) to increase the field density of modes and thus the coupling between light and mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals a regime where , regardless of whether the scatterers are atoms or mobile dielectrics , the coupling strength ( i )  scales superlinearly ( @xmath7 ) with the number of scatterers and ( ii )  does not saturate as the reflectivity of the elements approaches unity . </S>",
    "<S> this allows in principle multi - element opto- or electro - mechanical systems to reach single - photon optomechanical coupling strengths orders of magnitude larger than those currently possible , and does not require wavelength - scale confinement of the light field . </S>",
    "<S> concomitantly , we show that in this configuration ( iii )  the resonator field couples to a specific collective mechanical mode supporting inter - element interactions that are as long - ranged as the array itself . since the model is applicable both to mobile dielectrics , such as membranes  @xcite or microspheres  @xcite , and to cold atoms in an optical lattice  @xcite , this new regime should realistically allow for achieving strong single - photon optomechanical coupling and realizing quantum optomechanical interfaces . </S>",

    "<S> this time , we suppose that the membrane has an amplitude reflectivity @xmath12 , which we parametrize in terms of the polarizability @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the single - photon optomechanical coupling strength is now @xmath14 , which is maximized to @xmath0 for large @xmath15 , i.e. , in the _ reflective _ regime @xmath16 . in order to illustrate the emergence of collective optomechanics </S>",
