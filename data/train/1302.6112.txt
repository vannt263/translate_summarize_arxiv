    "the properties of multi - electron systems can in principle be predicted by solving the interacting many - body schrdinger equation .",
    "however , numerical solutions are only feasible for small systems consisting of a few interacting electrons due to the exponential scaling of the computational demand with the number of particles .",
    "one possible way to overcome this so - called `` exponential wall '' @xcite is density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , which has been successfully applied to many - body systems in a wide range of areas in physics and chemistry .",
    "dft is based on the existence of an energy functional whose minimization yields the ground state density .",
    "this minimization is usually performed via the so - called kohn - sham ( ks ) construction @xcite where the interacting multi - particle system is mapped to a unique system of non - interacting particles having the same ground - state density .",
    "the non - interacting problem decouples into ( non - linear ) one - particle equations with an effective hamiltonian depending on the density .",
    "the advantage of dft thus originates from the fact that the solution of @xmath0 one - particle equations is less involved than solving one exponentially scaling @xmath0-particle problem .",
    "the crucial ingredient in the ks construction is the hartree - exchange - correlation ( hxc ) potential which , if it was exact , would comprise all many - body effects .",
    "its exact form is , however , unknown in general , and approximations have to be employed in practice .",
    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) extends dft to time - dependent problems @xcite .",
    "the existence of a time - dependent ks system is , however , no longer based on a minimization principle but on the local force equation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the exact time - dependent hxc potential has additional , subtle features : it depends on the initial state ( both interacting and non - interacting ) and on the density at previous times ( that is , it has `` memory '' ) @xcite . therefore the construction of better approximations to the hxc potential within tddft is much more involved than in dft .",
    "this is even more of a problem as it turns out that the hxc approximations known from dft often fail when applied to tddft beyond linear response @xcite",
    ".    one might think that if tddft is employed to the study of multi - particle systems subject to time - periodic external potentials , e.g. , an atom interacting with a monochromatic laser field , one could involve the floquet theorem .",
    "indeed , in such situations the interacting many - body time - dependent schrdinger equation is a partial differential equation with time - periodic coefficients and thus admits a time - periodic basis . as a consequence , the problem can be converted into an infinite set of time - independent equations by virtue of the floquet theorem @xcite .    already at the beginning of the application of density - functional theory to time - dependent systems attempts",
    "were made to incorporate floquet theory in a density - functional framework @xcite .",
    "a minimization principle was proposed , which was perturbative in nature and hence valid only for weak and off - resonant fields . however , even if these conditions are met there are problems with defining a proper adiabatic limit , which is fundamental to the proposed minimization procedure @xcite .",
    "the problems arise due to the fact that floquet theory maps the quasi - spectrum of the time - dependent problem into an interval of length @xmath1 , i.e. , the frequency of the periodicity employed . in any interval @xmath2 for @xmath3 arbitrary",
    "we find infinitely many quasi - eigenenergies ( they are dense in @xmath4 ) and thus infinitely many eigenfunctions around every point in the quasi - spectrum .",
    "a consequence of this is that there is no unique final state to which the system tends as the external perturbation is turned off adiabatically . in order to restore the adiabatic limit a truncation to a finite basis",
    "is usually employed , which is anyway unavoidable in practical calculations .    in refs .",
    "@xcite floquet - dft approaches were pursued for non - perturbative fields and later criticized in refs .",
    "@xcite where the authors also suggested to embark upon the problem from a tddft point of view , thereby avoiding the minimization problem .",
    "the basic question then remains whether a floquet basis can be found for the associated ks system , i.e. , whether the ks hamiltonian itself is periodic .",
    "known explicit expressions for the exchange - correlation potential in the time - dependent ks hamiltonian such as the adiabatic local density approximation or generalized gradient approximations @xcite have the feature that a periodic density will lead to a periodic ks hamiltonian ( with the same period ) since the adiabatic hxc potentials depend on the instantaneous density only .",
    "however , the density does not have to be periodic and , in fact , it generally is not , as we will demonstrate in this work . on the other hand , even if an approximate functional leads to an aperiodic ks potential because of , e.g. , an aperiodic density , this does not yet demonstrate the incompatibility of tddft and floquet theory , because the unknown _ exact _ ks potential nevertheless could be periodic . in this work",
    "we will show by means of numerical and analytical counter examples that this , unfortunately , is not the case and thus tddft is , in general , not compatible with floquet theory .",

    "now we make the basic assumption of any floquet approach in a density - functional framework : if the hamiltonian @xmath25 describing the @xmath0 interacting electrons is periodic with the frequency @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , then we assume the same periodicity for the ks hamiltonian as well .",

    "hence , the floquet theorem can not be applied .    here , for our example for which we are able to write down an explicit expression for the ks potential , we have proven that for _ any _ initial ks state it is impossible to have a laser - periodic ks potential when the density has another period .",
    "we investigated the applicability of the floquet theorem to time - dependent kohn - sham hamiltonians . by employing analytically and numerically exactly solvable counter examples we showed that",
    ", in general , floquet theory is not compatible with time - dependent density functional theory .",
    "the reason is that , while periodic drivers such as laser fields of course render the interacting many - body hamiltonian periodic , the corresponding kohn - sham hamiltonian , in general , is aperiodic .",
    "we discussed how the periodicity properties of the single - particle density translate to the kohn - sham potential .",
    "if in the floquet analysis of the many - body time - dependent schrdinger wave function more than one floquet state plays a role  such as for non - adiabatic ramping or resonant interactions  the exact kohn - sham potential is aperiodic so that the floquet theorem is inapplicable .",
    "further we showed that also the initial - state dependence of the time - dependent kohn - sham hamiltonian can not be employed to restore its periodicity .",
    "of course , one may view kohn - sham - floquet theory as an approximative approach for the study of laser - matter phenomena in which resonances and non - adiabaticities are expected to be not relevant .",
