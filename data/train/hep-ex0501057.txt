    "the angle @xmath4 can be determined using a time dependent analysis in charmless decays such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the extraction of @xmath4 has been studied in several theoretical approaches.@xcite an isospin analysis@xcite that requires knowledge of the branching fractions of @xmath9 can determine @xmath4 with relatively little theoretical uncertainty .    here",
    "we present a time dependent analysis of @xmath10 violation in @xmath0 decays .",
    "we also report on the first evidence for @xmath11 decay .",
    "as the final state @xmath7 is not a @xmath10 eigenstate , one has to consider four decay modes with different charge and flavor combinations : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the decay rates can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the proper - time difference between the fully reconstructed and the associated @xmath16 decay , and @xmath17 corresponds to @xmath18 tags .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are associated with mixing - induced @xmath10 violation ( related to @xmath4 ) and flavor - dependent direct @xmath10 violation , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath10-conserving . @xmath22 describes the asymmetry between the rates @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath21 depends in addition on difference in strong phases between the amplitudes contributing to @xmath5 decays .",
    "the direct @xmath10 violation is related to the time and flavor integrated charge asymmetry , @xmath25 , defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the sum of the yields for @xmath29 and @xmath30 decays to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we also define two separate direct-@xmath10 related asymmetries : @xmath33 the analysis is based on the quasi - two - body approach .",
    "we consider @xmath34 candidates from two distinct bands in the @xmath35 dalitz plot .",
    "the @xmath36 candidates are selected by requiring two oppositely charged pion - candidate tracks with @xmath37 candidates .",
    "charged tracks are required to originate from the interaction point and have transverse momenta greater than 100 mev / c . to identify tracks as charged pions",
    ", we combine information from time - of - flight counters , aerogel threshold cherenkov counters and the central tracking chambers .",
    "neutral pion candidates are reconstructed from photon pairs with invariant masses in the range @xmath38 , and momentum larger than 200 mev/@xmath39 in the laboratory frame .",
    "photon candidates are selected with a minimum energy requirement of 50 mev in the barrel region of the electromagnetic calorimeter @xmath40 and 100 mev in the endcap regions , where @xmath41 denotes the polar angle of the photon with respect to the beam line .",
    "we also apply a cut on the angle between the photon flight direction and the boost direction from the laboratory system in the @xmath37 rest frame , @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath16 meson candidates are identified using two kinematic variables : the beam energy constrained mass @xmath43 , and the energy difference @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the center - of - mass ( cm ) beam energy , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the reconstructed energy and momentum of the @xmath16 candidate in the cm frame .",
    "we accept events in the region @xmath48 and @xmath49 and define a signal region as @xmath50 and @xmath51 . to avoid the region where the @xmath31 and @xmath32 amplitudes interfere ,",

    "the dominant background to @xmath7 is @xmath54 @xmath55 continuum events . to discriminate the signal from the background we use the event topology , which tends to be isotropic for @xmath56 events and jet - like for @xmath57 events .",
    "we combine a fisher discriminant based on five modified fox - wolfram moments@xcite with the cosine of the angle between the flight direction of the @xmath16 in the cm frame and the electron beam direction to form the likelihood ratio @xmath58 . here ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are likelihood functions for signal and continuum events , respectively .",
    "the continuum background is reduced by applying a cut @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath62-flavor of the accompanying @xmath16 meson is identified using tracks not associated with the reconstructed @xmath0 decays .",
    "the tagging algorithm is identical to that used for the belle sin@xmath63 measurement@xcite .",
    "the tagging information is represented by two parameters , @xmath64 , the flavor , and a quality factor @xmath65 that ranges from @xmath66 for no flavor discriminant to @xmath67 for unambiguous flavor assignment .",
    "the signal - side tracks and the tag - side tracks are fit for the signal ( @xmath68 ) and tag ( @xmath69 ) side vertices using an interaction point constraint .",
    "taking into account that @xmath70 are produced practically at rest in the @xmath2 cm frame , the proper time difference @xmath71 is proportional to the distance between vertices @xmath72 : @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the lorentz boost of the @xmath3 system .",
    "the @xmath75 yields are extracted using an unbinned maximum - likelihood ( ml ) fit to the two - dimensional ( @xmath76 ) distribution .",
