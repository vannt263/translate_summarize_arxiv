    "fascinating magnetic behavior , exotic ground states and new quantum phenomena have been discovered over the last years by intensive investigations of spin-1/2 magnetic insulators .",
    "spin - peierls transitions,@xcite skyrmions  @xcite and bose - einstein condensation of magnons  @xcite are only some examples for such phenomena that attracted so much attention since they enable expanding our understanding of the quantum nature of matter and may be relevant for high - tech applications.@xcite the diversity of magnetic properties observed , in particular in cu@xmath0 compounds is directly related to the huge variety of crystal structures that can be found in this class of materials : the magnetic cu@xmath0-ion and its ligands x typically form ( distorted ) square - planar cux@xmath4 plaquettes , which can either remain well isolated in the structure or may be linked in various ways to form dimers , chains , planes or even more intricate frameworks .",
    "the arrangement and connectivity of the plaquettes as well as their geometric distortion directly determine the strength and type of magnetic exchange interactions and , thus , the macroscopic magnetic properties .",
    "accordingly , the evaluation of individual exchange pathways and the subsequent development of a microscopic magnetic model is essential for understanding the magnetic behavior .",
    "this task , however , is far from being trivial .    as a first step toward the microscopic understanding of magnetic materials ,",
    "a set of valuable empirical rules has been derived by goodenough , kanamori and anderson ( gka ) . for cuprates ,",
    "these rules basically describe how the exchange interactions depend on the cu ",
    "x  cu bridging angle.@xcite however , a straight forward application of these rules often results in inappropriate microscopic magnetic models , since in general many details , such as covalency , distortions or neighboring anionic groups , play an important role.@xcite in the last years , the combination of experiments and advanced theoretical methods , such as density functional theory ( dft ) or wave - function ( wf)-based approaches , has turned out as a reliable strategy for developing microscopic magnetic models in cases where experiment or theory alone may leave ambiguities.@xcite the ambiguity of describing experimental data with different models usually stems from the large number of independent model parameters which , in turn , allow for similarly good fits of the measured data for several models or parameter regimes .    in the case of computational methods",
    ", ambiguities arise from different approximations for the description of strong electron correlations , for which no feasible general scheme is available so far .",
    "the problems are particularly severe in case of weak couplings close to the transition from an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) regime , where subtle features of the crystal structure play a crucial role .",
    "however , at least a qualitative evaluation of such couplings is essential because it helps to establish the dimensionality of the system , the relevance of magnetic frustration , and other important details of the magnetic model .",
    "ambiguities in the computational results have been encountered , e.g. , for the ( cu@xmath5)la@xmath6o@xmath7 ( @xmath5=cl , br ; @xmath8=nb , ta ) family,@xcite azurite,@xcite cdvo@xmath9@xcite and @xmath10-cu@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath7.@xcite in all these cases , the mean - field treatment of hubbard correlations on top of standard dft  the so - called dft+@xmath11 method  was employed .",
    "problems , in particular with respect to the coupling strength , also occurred for other computation techniques that rest upon the admixture of hartree - fock exchange to dft functionals ( hybrid functionals)@xcite or an advanced wf - based treatment of electronic correlations.@xcite    in the present work , we investigate the natural cu@xmath0-mineral callaghanite .",
    "it features well isolated cu@xmath1(oh)@xmath2 dimers ( fig .",
    "[ struct ] ) with a bridging angle of 96.14@xmath12 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : xxstr ] ) that falls into the range of 9598@xmath12 where the transition from fm to afm coupling typically occurs.@xcite this behavior follows the empirical gka rules , which require that fm couplings prevail for bridging angles close to 90@xmath12 , where the usually dominating afm second - order contributions vanish for symmetry reasons .",
    "accordingly , callaghanite is a good candidate for nearly compensated fm and afm exchange contributions at the bridging angle of about @xmath13 .",
    "this expectation is actually supported by our magnetization and specific heat measurements ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : experiment ] ) revealing a quantum paramagnetic behavior and very weak exchange couplings with an absolute strength of below 10k . from an experimental point of view , this small energy scale renders the compound also a good candidate for observing interesting effects , such as quantum phase transitions under pressure . on the theoretical side , on which we will focus in the present study",
    ", this mineral represents an ideal system for testing the accuracy and reliability of different computational methods applied to strongly correlated compounds .",
    "dft+@xmath11 , the pbe0 hybrid functional and wf - based multi - reference methods will be employed for calculating intra- and interdimer couplings , and the results will be compared and evaluated with respect to the experimental data .    the paper is organized as follows : experimental and theoretical methods are described in sec .",

    "the experimental part of this work was done on a natural sample ( fig .",
    "[ struct ] ) of callaghanite from the premiers chemical mine , gabbs , nye co. , nevada , usa . the sample quality was first checked by laboratory powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) ( huber g670 guinier camera , cuk@xmath14 radiation , imageplate detector , @xmath15 angle range ) .",
    "powder xrd patterns down to a temperature of 10k were collected at the id31 beamline of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf , grenoble ) at a wavelength of about 0.4 .",

    "heat capacity data were acquired by relaxation technique with a qd ppms in fields up to 8 t .",
    "the electronic and magnetic structure calculations within dft were performed with the full - potential local - orbital code ` fplo9.07 - 41`@xcite as well as with the vienna ab initio simulation package ( ` vasp5.2`).@xcite the first code was used in combination with the local density approximation ( lda),@xcite generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite and the dft+@xmath11 method.@xcite calculations using the pbe0 hybrid functional@xcite were carried out with ` vasp5.2 ` .",
    "a 4@xmath164@xmath164 @xmath17-mesh was employed for lda and gga runs while supercells used for dft+@xmath11 and pbe0 calculations were computed for about 20 @xmath17-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone . the convergence with respect to the @xmath17-mesh was carefully checked .",
    "the hydrogen positions , which are essential for the evaluation of the exchange couplings  @xcite but not yet determined experimentally,@xcite were obtained by a relaxation of the h atomic parameters with respect to the total energy within gga.@xcite such a procedure was recently proven to provide sufficiently accurate h - positions for cuprates.@xcite    the exchange coupling constants were calculated in two different ways within dft .",
    "one strategy starts from an lda band structure .",
    "since lda does not properly account for strong electron correlations , it typically yields a spurious metallic ground state .",
    "the half - filled bands at the fermi level , however , allow identifying the crucial exchange pathways and are sufficient for the calculation of the low - energy part of the magnetic excitation spectrum . projecting these bands onto a tight - binding ( tb ) model",
    ", we obtain the transfer integrals @xmath18 , which were calculated as off - diagonal hamiltonian matrix - elements between cu - centered wannier functions .",
    "next , the tb - model was projected onto a single - band hubbard model that accounts for the strong electron correlations by including the effective onsite coulomb repulsion , @xmath19 , pertaining to the mixed cu - o wannier functions , @xmath20 .",
    "subsequently , the hubbard model is mapped onto a heisenberg model @xmath21 this is justified for @xmath22 and half - filling , as realized in callaghanite ( table  [ tj ] ) .",

    "the onsite coulomb repulsion of the cu(3@xmath28 ) orbitals , @xmath29 , was varied between 5.58.0ev and 7.011.0ev for amf and fll dccs , respectively , covering the ranges of @xmath30ev and @xmath31ev that are typically used for these two types of dccs as implemented in ` fplo9.07 - 41`.@xcite the onsite hunds exchange , @xmath32 , was fixed to 1.0ev .",
    "additionally , we evaluated the intradimer exchange constant @xmath33 with wf - based methods , which allow for an in principle parameter - free treatment of electron correlations .",
    "the calculations were all done in a scalar - relativistic mode using the ` orca2.9 ` code.@xcite since the application of wf - based methods is restricted to finite systems with a limited number of atoms , @xmath33 is calculated for an isolated [ cu@xmath1(oh)@xmath2]@xmath35 cluster .",

    "the point charges were optimized so that pbe0 and unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) cluster results for @xmath33 agree with those from periodic calculations performed with ` vasp5.2 ` . in order to reduce the number of electrons in the calculations ,",
    "the inner 10 electrons ( ne core ) of cu were simulated with a stuttgart - dresden effective core potential ( ecp).@xcite the following basis sets were used for the calculations : def2-tzvpp basis for cu valence electrons,@xcite aug - cc - pvtz for oxygen  @xcite and a simple 3 - 21 g basis for hydrogen.@xcite the basis set convergence was carefully checked with pbe0 as well as with @xmath36-electron valence state perturbation theory ( nevpt2).@xcite starting from a broken - symmetry lda - wf , we performed complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) calculations with a minimum active space , including the two unpaired electrons in two orbitals .",
    "dynamical correlations were subsequently included by the difference dedicated configuration interaction ( ddci3 ) method.@xcite owing to the fact that ddci was designed for computing energy differences , it represents one of the most accurate schemes for calculating exchange constants .",

    "owing to the very weak dispersion of these four bands , the splitting between the occupied and unoccupied bands @xmath64 at the center of the brillouin zone , @xmath65 , can be interpreted in terms of the molecular orbital ( mo ) picture for superexchange presented by hay et al .",
