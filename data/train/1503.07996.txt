    "the situation now changed with the availability of new experimental data @xcite , which , as we will see , strongly constrain the value of @xmath6 .",

    "this means that the matrix element @xmath0 has been largely overestimated in the past dis or qcd sum rule analyses at finite density .",
    "indeed , applying the novel estimate of @xmath6 to the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the electromagnetic current , which contains information on the spin - averaged structure functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , it is found that the above matrix element only gives a contribution of 3 % or less compared to the experimentally extracted values of the twist-4 effects in the second moments of these structure functions and can , therefore , be ignored at the presently available level of precision , which is in contrast to the conclusions of earlier studies .",
    "furthermore , examining the ope of the vector current correlator in nuclear matter , coupling to the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 mesons , and , separately , the nuclear correlator in nuclear matter , we similarly find the relevant contributions to be small .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "before discussing the estimation of @xmath6 based on the newly available experimental data , we here for illustration and later comparison briefly describe two simple methods , that have so far been used to compute @xmath6 .      here , we will follow @xcite to estimate the needed matrix element .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 in the first line represents the average momentum of the quark @xmath23 in the nucleon , while the second line follows from the assumption that @xmath22 is about @xmath24 of the nucleon momentum @xmath4 , as half of the nucleon momentum is carried by the gluons and the rest is divided evenly among the three valence quarks . transforming this result into a traceless form",
    ", we get @xmath25 which hence means : @xmath26 expressing this through the quark mass @xmath27 and the @xmath28 sigma term @xmath29 , we get @xmath30 using @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 @xcite , we finally obtain @xmath33      here , we briefly recapitulate the discussion of @xcite to estimate the needed matrix elements . combining eqs.(4.43 ) and",
    "( 4.49 ) of @xcite , we obtain @xmath34 where the second term follows from the fact that the two covariant derivatives do not commute . the above equation",
    "then immediately gives @xmath35 employing a bag model estimate , it was furthermore shown in @xcite that first term in the bracket on the right - hand side of the above equation is much smaller than the second one and can , therefore , be ignored .    next , using a parametrization proposed in @xcite @xmath36 we are led to @xmath37 @xmath38 is believed to be about @xmath39 in vacuum @xcite , which was assumed in @xcite to hold also for the one - nucleon state .",
    "this assumptions leads to @xmath40 which is about 5 times larger than eq.([eq : old.est.1 ] ) of the previous subsection .    as we will see later ,",
    "the estimate in eq.([eq : dd2.200 ] ) turns out to be 2 orders of magnitude larger than our updated value based on experimental constraints .",
    "this means that the ansatz of eq.([eq : new ] ) with @xmath39 is most likely an overestimation of the actual matrix element .",
    "we , therefore , caution the practitioners of qcd sum rules at finite density to be careful when making use of this parametrization .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the only information that we presently have from experiment , is the magnitude of @xmath13 [ given in eq.([eq : ev ] ) ] at a few values of @xmath15 .",
    "this , obviously , does not suffice to determine @xmath6 completely and we , thus , have to introduce a number of assumptions on the relations of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and their sea - quark counterparts .",
    "for this , we will have to rely partially on model calculations of @xmath1 . specifically , these models are the bag model ( bm ) @xcite , the chiral quark soliton model ( @xmath43qsm ) @xcite , and the spectator model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "to get an idea of the systematic uncertainties of these assumptions and models , we will test several versions of them and study their effects on @xmath6 . for illustration",
    "we give the @xmath6 values and their respective flavor decompositions obtained from the bm , @xmath43qsm , and sm in table [ tab : model.val ] .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to get an idea of the size of the contributions of the twist-4 terms , we will here evaluate their contribution to the ope of the @xmath20 meson at rest .",
    "a more detailed study on the ope for the general finite three - momentum case will be done elsewhere .",
    "let us simplify eq.([eq : final.res ] ) by setting @xmath44 , which means that we are working in the nuclear matter rest frame .",
    "furthermore , we set @xmath45 , take the trace over the lorentz indices and define @xmath46 which gives for the dimension - six , twist-4 term , @xmath47 considering the expression of @xmath48 together with the numbers of table [ tab : abcm4 ] , it is seen that @xmath49 gives the dominant contribution for all data sets and that @xmath50 with our new estimate is negligibly small .",
    "it is , however , noted that with the old estimate of eq.([eq : dd2.200 ] ) , which would mean using @xmath51 instead of @xmath50 , the @xmath50-term would , due to its large prefactor @xmath52 , actually have provided by far the largest contribution and would have increased the overall value of @xmath48 at least by a factor of about 4 .",
    "if the findings of this paper are correct , this will help to largely reduce the twist-4 contributions to this sum rule .",
    "making use now of our new estimate of @xmath50 and of the other parameters given in table [ tab : abcm4 ] , the variable @xmath48 is found to take values that lie roughly between 4 and 9 mev .",
    "after borel - transforming the result of eq.([eq : phi.ope.result ] ) , we obtain @xmath53 let us compare this finding with the other terms appearing in the ope at the same order .",
    "these are given for instance in eq.(12 ) of @xcite , from which we list below the linear density coefficients of the dimension - six term : @xmath54 numerically , these give @xmath55 for which we have used @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which is rather on the larger side considering the recent lattice qcd calculations of this quantity .",
    "for the other parameters , we used the values given in @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the above numbers that the four - quark condensate term is dominant .",
    "all this now has to be compared to eq.([eq : www ] ) , without the density and borel mass factors .",
    "this leads to @xmath58 where we have set @xmath59 , which lies at the center of the expected value range of @xmath48 . even though our new estimate of the @xmath50 operator has helped to reduce the magnitude of the twist-4 contribution , the result of eq.([eq : twist4 ] )",
    "is still rather large , namely , of the same order as four - quark condensate term and more than 16 times larger than the twist-2 term .",

    "we have in this work studied the matrix element @xmath0 and have for the first time provided an estimate for its value that is based on experimental constraints . to do this , we partially had to rely on a number of assumptions on the relative contributions of @xmath61 and @xmath74 quarks and their respective antiparticles to @xmath6 and , furthermore , on the behavior of @xmath1 at small and large @xmath15 . for setting up these assumptions we followed the guidance of the bag model @xcite , the chiral quark soliton model @xcite and the spectator model @xcite , which have been used to compute the contributions of the different quark flavors to @xmath1 .",
    "the final result , given in eq.([eq : new.estimate.e2 ] ) , contains both the uncertainties of the experimental results of @xcite and the systematic errors due to the assumptions derived from the different quark models .",

    "it hence seems to be essentially impossible to reconcile the experimental data of @xcite with the old estimates of @xmath6 , which , therefore , should be discarded in future studies .    to study the consequences of our findings",

    "our calculations show that , with the new estimate of eq.([eq : new.estimate.e2 ] ) , @xmath6 is so small that its contribution to the ope for all the above - mentioned cases turns out to be negligible .",
    "let us here especially mention the ope corresponding to the @xmath20 meson channel , for which the relevant operator is @xmath93 . with the old value of eq.([eq : dd2.200 ] ) , this would have become the dominant twist-4 term , with seizable consequences for the behavior of the @xmath20 meson in nuclear matter , but our result shows that this is not the case .",
    "we furthermore studied the contribution of the present operator to the nucleon scalar and vector self - energy and the nuclear symmetry energy in nuclear matter as obtained from the nucleon sum rule . from this",
    ", we found that the uncertainties of the self - energies due to @xmath6 are much reduced with our new estimate .",
    "for the nuclear symmetry energy , the effect of @xmath6 turned out to be minimal .",
    "our new estimate of @xmath6 will also have consequences for the ope of other channels not studied in this work , which will be relevant for investigations of the behavior of the respective hadrons in nuclear matter .",
    "one such case could , for instance , be the study of the @xmath94 or @xmath49 meson spectrum at finite density @xcite .",
    "as @xmath6 , however , turns out to be small , it can generally be expected to have only a marginal effect , but this needs to be confirmed in a separate calculation for each channel of interest .",
