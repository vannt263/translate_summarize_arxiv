    "the study of wealth distribution  @xcite in a society has remained an intriguing problem since vilfredo pareto who first observed  @xcite that the number of rich people with wealth @xmath0 decay following an inverse power - law : @xmath1 @xmath2 is the number density of people possessing wealth @xmath0 and @xmath3 is known as the pareto exponent .",
    "this exponent generally assumes a value between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in different economies and times  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that for low and medium income , the number density @xmath2 falls off much faster : exponentially  @xcite or in a log - normal way  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", easy availability of data in electronic media has helped in the analysis of wealth or income distributions in various societies  @xcite .",
    "it is now more or less established that the distribution has a power - law tail for the large ( about 5% of the population ) wealth / income while the majority ( around 95% ) low income distribution fits well to gibbs or log - normal form  @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to model a simple economy with minimum trading ingredients , which involve a wealth exchange process  @xcite that produce a distribution of wealth similar to that observed in the real market .",
    "we are particularly interested in microscopic models of markets where the ( economic ) trading activity is considered as a scattering process  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for recent extensive reviews ) .",
    "we concentrate on models that incorporate ` saving propensity ' ( of the agents ) as an essential ingredient in a trading process , and reproduces the salient features seen across wealth distributions in varied economies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "much earlier , angle  @xcite studied an inequality process , which can be mapped to the uniform savings models is certain cases ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed review",
    ".    these studies also show ( and discussed briefly here ) how the distribution of savings can be modified to reproduce the salient features of empirical distributions of wealth  namely the shape of the distribution for the low and middle wealth and the tunable pareto exponent . in all these models",
    "@xcite , ` savings ' was introduced as a quenched parameter that remained invariant with time ( or trading ) .",
    "apart from presenting a brief summary in section ii ( giving the established results in such models ) , we present new results for a similar ( gas like ) market model , where the exchange is for a non - consumable commodity ( globally conserved , like money ) .",
    "we find , although the details of the steady - state money and wealth ( money and commodity together ) distributions differ considerably , the same pareto tail feature appears in both , with identical exponent ( @xmath3 ) value .",
    "we first consider an ideal - gas model of a closed economic system .",
    "wealth is measured in terms of the amount of money possessed by an individual .",
    "production is not allowed i.e , total money @xmath6 is fixed and also there is no migration of population i.e , total number of agents @xmath7 is fixed , and the only economic activity is confined to trading . each agent @xmath8 , individual or corporate , possess money @xmath9 at time @xmath10 . in any trading , a pair of agents @xmath8 and @xmath11 randomly exchange their money  @xcite , such that their total money is ( locally ) conserved and none posses negative money ( @xmath12 , i.e , debt not allowed ) : @xmath13 @xmath14 all the money transactions considered in this paper follow local conservation : @xmath15 the time ( @xmath10 ) changes by one unit after each trading and @xmath16 is a random fraction chosen independently for each trading or at each time @xmath10 .",
    "the steady - state ( @xmath17 ) distribution of money is gibbs one : @xmath18 no matter how uniform or justified the initial distribution is , the eventual steady state corresponds to gibbs distribution where most of the people have very little money .",
    "this follows from the conservation of money and additivity of entropy : @xmath19 this steady state result is quite robust and realistic .",
    "several variations of the trading  @xcite , does not affect the distribution .",
    "in any trading , savings come naturally  @xcite . a saving factor @xmath20",
    "is therefore introduced in the same model  @xcite ( ref .",
    "@xcite is the model without savings ) , where each trader at time @xmath10 saves a fraction @xmath20 of its money @xmath9 and trades randomly with the rest . in each of the following two cases ,",
    "the savings fraction does not vary with time , and hence we call it ` quenched ' in the terminology of statistical mechanics .      for the case of ` uniform ' savings ,",
    "the money exchange rules remain the same ( eqn .",
    "( [ mdelm ] ) ) , where @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a random fraction , coming from the stochastic nature of the trading .",
    "@xmath20 is a fraction ( @xmath22 ) which we call the saving factor .",
    "the market ( non - interacting at @xmath23 and @xmath4 ) becomes effectively ` interacting ' for any non - vanishing @xmath24 : for uniform @xmath20 ( same for all agents ) , the steady state distribution @xmath25 of money is sharply decaying on both sides with the most - probable money per agent shifting away from @xmath26 ( for @xmath23 ) to @xmath27 as @xmath28",
    ". the self - organizing feature of this market , induced by sheer self - interest of saving by each agent without any global perspective , is very significant as the fraction of paupers decrease with saving fraction @xmath20 and most people possess some fraction of the average money in the market ( for @xmath28 , the socialists dream is achieved with just people s self - interest of saving ! ) .",
    "this uniform saving propensity does not give the pareto - like power - law distribution yet , but the markovian nature of the scattering or trading processes ( eqn .",
    "( [ prob ] ) ) is lost and the system becomes co - operative . through @xmath20 , the agents indirectly get to develop a correlation with ( start interacting with ) each other and the system co - operatively self - organizes  @xcite towards a most - probable distribution .",
    "this model has been understood to a certain extent ( see e.g ,  @xcite ) , and argued to resemble a gamma distribution  @xcite , and partly explained analytically .",
    "this model clearly finds its relevance in cases where the economy consists of traders with ` waged ' income  @xcite .      in a real society or economy",
    ", @xmath20 is a very inhomogeneous parameter : the interest of saving varies from person to person .",
    "we move a step closer to the real situation where saving factor @xmath20 is widely distributed within the population  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of money in such a trading can be written as : @xmath29 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one again follows the same rules ( eqn .",
    "( [ mdelm ] ) ) as before , except that @xmath31 here ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the saving propensities of agents @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "the agents have uniform ( over time ) saving propensities , distributed independently , randomly and uniformly ( white ) within an interval @xmath34 to @xmath4 agent @xmath8 saves a random fraction @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and this @xmath35 value is quenched for each agent ( @xmath35 are independent of trading or @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xmath2 is found to follow a strict power - law decay .",
    "this decay fits to pareto law ( [ par ] ) with @xmath37 for several decades .",
    "this power law is extremely robust : a distribution @xmath38 of quenched @xmath20 values among the agents produce power law distributed @xmath0 with pareto index @xmath39 , irrespective of the value of @xmath40 . for negative @xmath40 values , however , we get an initial ( small @xmath0 ) gibbs - like decay in @xmath2 . in case @xmath41 , the pareto exponent is modified to @xmath42 , which qualifies for the non - universal exponents in the same model @xcite .",
    "this model  @xcite has been thoroughly analyzed , and the analytical derivation of the pareto exponent has been achieved in certain cases  @xcite . the pareto exponent has been derived to exactly @xmath4 .    in this model , agents with higher saving propensity tend to hold higher average wealth , which is justified by the fact that the saving propensity in the rich population is always high  @xcite .",
    "in the above markets , modifications due to exchange of a consumable commodity hardy affects the distribution , as the commodity once bought or sold need not be accounted for .",
    "consumable commodities effectively have no ` price ' , as due to their short lifetime to contribute to the total wealth of an individual .",
    "it is interesting however , to study the role of non - consumable commodities in such market models and this we do here .    in the simplified version of a market with a single non - consumable commodity , we again consider a fixed number of traders or agents @xmath7 who trade in a market involving total money @xmath43 and total commodity @xmath44 , @xmath9 and @xmath45 being the money and commodity of the @xmath8-th agent at time @xmath10 and are both non - negative .",
    "needless to mention , both @xmath9 and @xmath45 change with time or trading @xmath10 .",
    "the market , as before is closed , which means , @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath46 are constants .",
    "the wealth @xmath47 of an individual @xmath8 is thus , the sum of the money and commodity it possesses , i.e. , @xmath48 ; @xmath49 is the `` global '' price .",
    "in course of trading , total money and total commodity are locally conserved , and hence the total wealth . in such a market",
    ", one can define a global average price parameter @xmath50 , which is set here to unity , giving @xmath51 .",
    "it may be noted here that in order to avoid the complication of restricting the commodity - money exchange and their reversal between the same agents , the fisher velocity of money circulation ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) is renormalised to unity here . in order to accommodate the lack of proper information and the ability of the agents to bargain etc . , we will allow of course fluctuations @xmath52 in the price of the commodities at any trading ( time ) : @xmath53 .",
    "we find , the nature of steady state to be unchanged and independent of @xmath52 , once it becomes nonvanishing .      in general ,",
    "the dynamics of money in this market looks the same as eqn .",
    "( [ mdelm ] ) , with @xmath54 given by eqns .",
    "( [ deltam ] ) , ( [ eps ] ) or ( [ lrand ] ) depending on whether @xmath55 for all , @xmath56 but uniform for all @xmath8 or @xmath57 respectively .",
    "however , all @xmath54 are not allowed here ; only those , for which @xmath58 or @xmath59 are allowed by the corresponding changes @xmath60 or @xmath61 in their respective commodities ( @xmath62 ) : @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the local - time ` price ' parameter , a stochastic variable : @xmath66 the role of the stochasticity in @xmath65 is to imitate the effect of bargaining in a trading process .",
    "@xmath52 parametrizes the amount of stochasticity .",
    "the role of @xmath52 is significant in the sense that it determines the ( relaxation ) time the whole system takes to reach a dynamically equilibrium state ; the system reaches equilibrium sooner for larger @xmath52 , while its magnitude does not affect the steady state distribution .",
    "it may be noted that , in course of trading process , certain exchanges are not allowed ( e.g. , in cases when a particular pair of traders do not have enough commodity to exchange in favor of an agreed exchange of money ) .",
    "we then skip these steps and choose a new pair of agents for trading .      for @xmath67 ,",
    "of course , the wealth of each agent remains invariant with time ; only the proportion of money and commodity interchange within themselves , since the ` price ' factor remains constant .",
    "this of course happens irrespective of the savings factor being zero , uniform or distributed . for @xmath67 , the steady state distribution of money or commodity can take non - trivial forms : ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : commogif.flam.del0 ] ) , but has strictly a @xmath52-function behavior for the total wealth distribution ; it gets frozen at the value of wealth one starts with ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : commogif.flam.del0 ] for the case @xmath68 for all @xmath8 ) .",
    "as mentioned already for @xmath69 , the steady state results are not dependent on the value of @xmath52 ( the relaxation time of course decreases with increasing @xmath52 ) . in such a market with uniform savings , money distribution",
    "@xmath2 has a form similar to a set ( for @xmath70 ) of gamma functions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : commogif.flam.mc ] ) : a set of curves with a most - probable value shifting from @xmath34 to @xmath4 as saving factor @xmath20 changes from @xmath34 to @xmath4 ( as in the case without any commodity ) .",
    "the commodity distribution @xmath71 has an initial peak and an exponential fall - off , without much systematics with varying @xmath20 ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : commogif.flam.mc ] ) .",
    "the distribution @xmath72 of total wealth @xmath73 behaves much like @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : commogif.flam.w ] ) .",
    "it is to be noted that since there is no precise correspondence with commodity and money for @xmath69 ( unlike when @xmath67 , when the sum is fixed ) , @xmath72 can not be derived directly from @xmath2 and @xmath71 . however , there are further interesting features .",
    "although they form a class of gamma distributions , the set of curves for different values of saving factor @xmath20 seem to intersect at a common point , near @xmath74 .",
    "all the reported data are for a system of @xmath75 agents , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 and for a case where the noise level @xmath52 equals @xmath78% .    for @xmath20 distributed uniformly within the interval @xmath22 , the tails of both money and wealth distributions @xmath2 and @xmath72 have pareto law behavior with a fitting exponent value @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : commogif.dlam.mc ] and [ fig : commogif.dlam.w ] respectively ) , whereas the commodity distribution is still exponentially decaying ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : commogif.dlam.mc ] ) .",
    "let us first summarize the results for the models without any commodity ( money - only exchange models ) : there are @xmath7 players participating in a game , each having an initial capital of one unit of money .",
    "@xmath7 is very large , and total money @xmath81 remains fixed over the game ( so also the number of players @xmath7 ) .",
    "( a ) in the simplest version , the only move at any time is that two of these players are randomly chosen and they decide to share their total money randomly among them .",
    "as one can easily guess , the initial uniform ( a delta function ) distribution of money will soon disappear .",
    "let us ask what the eventual steady state distribution of money after many such moves will be ? at each move , a pair of randomly chosen players share a random fraction of their total money among themselves .",
    "the answer is well established in physics for more than a century  soon , there will be a stable money distribution and it will be gibbs distribution : @xmath82 $ ] ; @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "( b ) now think of a modified move in this game : each player ` saves ' a fraction @xmath20 of the money available with him / her after each move and while going to the next move .",
    "everybody saves the same fraction @xmath20 .",
    "what is the steady state distribution of money after a large number of such moves ?",
    "it becomes gamma - function like , while the distribution parameters of course depend on @xmath20 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) see also ref .",
    "@xcite ; for a somewhat different model with similar results developed much earlier . no exact treatment of this problem is available so far .",
    "( c ) what happens to the eventual money distribution among these players if @xmath20 is not the same for all players but is different for different players ? let the distribution @xmath84 of saving propensity @xmath20 be such that @xmath84 is non - vanishing when @xmath28 .",
    "the actual distribution will depend on the saving propensity distribution @xmath84 , but for all of them , the asymptotic form of the distribution will become pareto - like : @xmath85 ; @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "this is valid for all such distributions ( unless @xmath88 , when @xmath89 ) .",
    "however , for variation of @xmath84 such that @xmath90 for @xmath91 , one will get an initial gamma function form for @xmath2 for small and intermediate values of @xmath0 , with parameters determined by @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , and this distribution will eventually become pareto - like for @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "a somewhat rigorous analytical treatment of this problem is now available  @xcite .    a major limitation of these money - only exchange models considered earlier  @xcite ( and summarised in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) above )",
    "is that it does not make any explicit reference to the commodities exchanged with the money and to the constraints they impose .",
    "also , the wealth is not just the money is possession ( unless the commodity exchanged with the money is strictly consumable ) . here",
    ", we study the effect of a single non - consumable commodity on the money ( and also wealth ) distributions in the steady state , allowing for the total ( in time ) price fluctuation .",
    "this allowance of price fluctuation here is very crucial for the model ; it allows for the stochastic dynamics to play its proper role in the market . as such",
    ", this model is therefore quite different from that considered recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath49 is strictly unity and the stochasticity enters from other exogenous factors . in the sense that we also consider two exchangeable variables in the market , our model has some similarity with that in ref  @xcite . however , silver et al  @xcite consider only random exchanges between them ( keeping the total conserved ) while we consider random exchanges permitting price fluctuations and savings .",
    "as such they get only the gamma distribution in wealth , while we get both gamma and pareto distributions .    in spite of many significant effects due to the inclusion of a non - consumable commodity , the general feature of gamma - like form of the money ( and wealth ) distributions ( for uniform @xmath20 ) and the power law tails for both money and wealth ( for distributed @xmath20 ) with identical exponents , are seen to remain unchanged .",
    "the precise studies ( theories ) for the money - only exchange models are therefore extremely useful and relevant .    specifically , we study here numerically the behavior of an ideal gas like model of markets having only one non - consumable commodity .",
    "the total amount of money in the market @xmath94 , @xmath95 is fixed , so is the total amount of commodity @xmath96 and of course the total number of agents @xmath7 in the market . as in the market",
    "there is only one commodity , which is non - consumable , we normalize its global price @xmath97 to unity .",
    "the wealth of any agent @xmath8 at any time @xmath10 is therefore @xmath98 . if no fluctuation in price @xmath99 is allowed ( over @xmath49 ) , then the money - commodity exchange leads to trivial money and commodity distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : commogif.flam.del0 ] , which keeps the wealth of any agent unchanged over time .",
    "if we now allow the price @xmath65 at any time to fluctuate over @xmath49 by a factor @xmath52 ( as in ( [ pricedelta ] ) ) , nontrivial money , commodity and wealth distributions set in ( the steady states of which are independent of @xmath52 ; @xmath69 ) .",
    "we investigated here the behavior of the steady - state distributions of money , commodity and total wealth , as this dynamics of trading or exchange of money or commodity proceeds , allowing for temporal fluctuations in the price of the commodity .",
    "these distributions are studied in markets with agents having uniform ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : commogif.flam.mc ] and [ fig : commogif.flam.w ] ) and random saving factors ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : commogif.dlam.mc ] and [ fig : commogif.dlam.w ] ) .",
    "the self - organizing features in money distribution are similar to the cases without any commodity ( or with consumable commodities ) , the commodity distribution shows an exponential decay .",
    "the wealth distribution shows interesting behavior : gamma like distribution for uniform saving propensity and has a power - law tail ( with pareto exponent value @xmath39 ) for a market with agents having random saving propensity .",
    "although our results are numerical , and the pareto behavior for the wealth distribution tail gets somewhat more restricted in range ( compared to that of the money distribution ; see fig .",
    "( [ fig : commogif.dlam.mc ] ) ) , the robustness of the power - law behavior nevertheless becomes obvious from , say fig .",
    "( [ fig : commogif.dlam.mc ] ) , where the power law tail for the money distribution clearly dominates over the commodity distribution tail , which rapidly decays off exponentially .",
