    "recently pitknen @xcite proposed a method of proving the riemann hypothesis based on the orthogonality relations between eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian operator used in super - conformal transformations .",
    "the states orthogonal to a `` vacuum '' state correspond to the zeros of the riemann zeta - function . according to his proposal ,",
    "the proof of rh rests on proving the hermiticity of the inner product and an assumption about the conformal gauge invariance in the subspace of the states corresponding to the zeros of the @xmath12-function , the plausible role of ( super ) conformal invariance was proposed in @xcite .    in previous works",
    "@xcite we have already explored some possible strategies which could lead to a solution of the problem .",
    "now we will pursue one of them in detail .",
    "it is based on the idea already described above ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) which relates the non - trivial zeros of the @xmath12-function and orthogonality of eigenfunctions of the appropriately chosen operator .",
    "we are not assuming any ad - hoc symmetries like conformal invariance , but in fact , we show why the @xmath18 and @xmath19 symmetries are in direct correlation with the @xmath20 of the riemann s fundamental identity @xmath21 .",

    "since @xmath34 can be chosen arbitrarily , we choose it to be related to the bernoulli string spectral counting function , given by the jacobi theta series , @xmath35 this choice is justified in part by the fact that jacobi s theta series @xmath36 has a deep connection to the integral representations of the riemann zeta - function @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite show that the construction of a genuine inner product is impossible .",
    "therefore from now on we will loosely speak of a `` scalar product '' realizing that we do not have a scalar product as such .",
    "the crucial problem is whether there are zeros outside the critical line ( but still inside the critical strip ) and not the interpretation of equation ( [ eq : innerprpsi ] ) as a genuine inner product . despite this , we still rather loosely refer to this mapping as a scalar product .",
    "the states still have a real norm squared , which however need not to be positive - definite .    here",
    "we must emphasize that our arguments do not rely on the validity of the zeta - function regularization procedure @xcite , which precludes a rigorous interpretation of the right hand side of ( [ eq : thetarie ] ) as a scalar product .",
    "instead , we can simply replace the expression `` scalar product of @xmath54 and @xmath55 '' by the map @xmath67 of complex numbers defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in other words , our arguments do not rely on an evaluation of the integral @xmath71 , but only on the mapping @xmath72 , defined as the finite part of the integral ( [ eq : innerprpsi ] ) .",

    "the `` inner '' products are trivially divergent due to the contribution of the @xmath79 term of the gj theta series in the integral ( [ eq : innerprpsi ] ) . from now on , we denote for `` inner '' product in ( [ eq : innerprpsi ] ) and ( [ eq : map ] ) as the finite part of the integrals by simply removing the trivial infinity .",
    "we shall see in the next section , that this `` additive '' regularization is in fact compatible with the symmetries of the problem .",
    "in our approach , the rh emerges as a consequence of the symmetries of the orthogonal states to the `` vacuum '' state @xmath56 . to this end",
    "we prove now the first theorem :    _ th .",
    "1_. if @xmath80 and @xmath81 are such that @xmath82 , the symmetries of all the states @xmath57 orthogonal to the `` vacuum '' state are preserved by any map @xmath67 ( equation [ eq : map ] ) , which leads to @xmath83    _ proof _ : if the state associated with the complex number @xmath84 is orthogonal to the `` vacuum '' state and the `` scalar product '' is given by @xmath85 , then the riemann zeta - function has zeros at @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    if we equate @xmath90 , then @xmath91 .",

    "notice that our choice of @xmath95 and @xmath96 is compatible with this symmetry if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are related by @xmath97 .",
    "conversely , if we assume that the orthogonal states to the `` vacuum '' state have the same symmetries of @xmath65 , then @xmath80 and @xmath81 must be related by @xmath82 .",
    "this results in a very specific relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , obtained from @xmath98 for @xmath99 real .",
    "it is clear that a map with arbitrary values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 does not preserve the above symmetries .",
    "_ th . 2 _ .",
    "the rh is a direct consequence of the assumption that the kernel of the map @xmath100 has the same symmetry properties as the zeros of zeta .",
    "this means that the values of @xmath26 such that @xmath101 ; i.e. the states `` orthogonal '' to the `` vacuum '' state @xmath102 , are symmetrically distributed with respect to the critical line and come in multiplets of four arguments @xmath26 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "_ proof : _ due to the analytic properties of the function @xmath106 it follows from theorem 1 that such symmetry conditions are satisfied if and only if : @xmath107 , implying that @xmath108 from which in turn follows that : @xmath109 , so their real parts satisfy : @xmath110 .    hence , for a fixed value of @xmath111 , the value of its real part @xmath112 can be continuously changed by continuously changing @xmath113 , since @xmath114 .",
    "if we assume that the zeros form a discrete set of points , this means that @xmath115 is the only consistent value it can have .",
    "unless @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) which is absurd because this yields a constant potential @xmath34 , @xmath118 .",
    "the case @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) is also ruled out because the potential @xmath121 either blows up , is zero or is ill - defined depending on the values of @xmath45 . from this follows that @xmath122 is the only consistent and possible value which the real part of the zeros of zeta can have .",
    "therefore , rh follows directly from the latter conclusion .    another way of rephrasing this is to say that the family of the @xmath123 operators yields a continuous family of maps which map @xmath111 into @xmath112 .",
    "such pairs of points @xmath124 have the double - reflection symmetry @xmath125 , @xmath126 , if , and only if , @xmath127 from which it follows that @xmath128 .",

    "if @xmath132 is orthogonal to the `` vacuum '' state associated with the complex number @xmath133 then @xmath134 is a zero of the @xmath12 , and the real parts of @xmath26 and @xmath134 are related by @xmath135 . if one assumes a discrete set of zeros then these real parts must be independent of @xmath136 , that is independent of @xmath80 .",
    "this can be satisfied only if the orthogonal state has for its real part equal to @xmath137 , which yields @xmath138 , that is the rh .",
    "_ th . 3 _ . the @xmath139 symmetry of the riemann nontrivial zeros and the @xmath31 symmetry of the `` inner '' products , are concatenated with the @xmath140 symmetry of the `` orthogonal '' states to a `` vacuum '' state @xmath141 , for any real @xmath9 .",
    "_ proof : _ gauss has shown that @xcite , @xmath142 where the jacobi series @xmath143 is defined by equation ( [ eq : jacobitheta ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : gauss ] ) implies that one can always find a @xmath9 , such that @xmath144 for all values of @xmath7 if , and only if , @xmath145 .",
    "due to ( @xmath136 ) are real , this forces @xmath9 be a real . in terms of ( @xmath99 )",
    "this relation becomes , @xmath146 , that when @xmath147 gives the known relation @xmath148 .",
    "then , invariance of the `` inner '' product under the inversion symmetry , @xmath149 follows by adopting a standard regularization procedure of removing the infinities , which yields the well defined finite parts : @xmath150 . if this invariance under inversion holds for all values of @xmath7 and due to the fact that @xmath151 ( except for the trivial case when @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) the only consistent solution , for all values of @xmath154 , has to be @xmath155 due to riemann s fundamental identity @xmath156 .",
    "then one can write down the integrals , after removing the infinities , in explicit form as , @xmath157 under @xmath158 we have , @xmath159    adopting an `` additive '' regularization procedure of removing the infinities , one can see that ( [ eq : gtoz ] ) = ( [ eq : infinity ] ) .",

    "the origins of the symmetry @xmath161 in the scalar product @xmath162 stem from the invariance of the integral ( [ eq : gtoz ] ) ( modulo the infinities ) under the @xmath158 transformation .",
    "such invariance is translated as an invariance under @xmath163 , based on the gauss - jacobi relation .",
    "notice how important it is not to introduce _ ad hoc _ any symmetries , like conformal invariance , without justifying their origins .",
    "we are basing everything in the fundamental relation @xmath164 , therefore our symmetry @xmath165 is well justified .    from the symmetries of theorem 3 ,",
    "one can easily show that @xmath166 .",
    "then , the rh will follows immediately , since , @xmath167 .",
    "the real values of this equation are @xmath168 .    and",
    "as we have seen earlier in section [ sec : zeros ] , because @xmath169 depends continuously on the parameter @xmath170 , for any given fixed value of @xmath41 , one could always assign in a continuous manner zeros whose real parts are of the given form .",
    "this can be achieved by simply varying in a continuous fashion the parameter @xmath170 .",
    "if , and only if , the zeros are discrete the only compatible and consistent solution is , @xmath171 .",

    "the orthogonal states to the new `` vacuum '' are such that , @xmath177 = -z ( s ' ) = 0 $ ] .",
    "now we will demonstrate how by choosing a continuous family of operators with @xmath178 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath179 ) , the rh is a direct consequence of the fact that the states orthogonal to the `` vacuum '' state have the same symmetry properties as the zeros of @xmath12-function .    from the relation @xmath180",
    ", one can generate the equation for a family of lines passing though the point ( @xmath181 ) given mathematically by @xmath182 .",

    "those lines are either : ( i ) parallel to the critical riemann line or ( ii ) they are not parallel . in case ( i )",

    "the family of lines @xmath190 , parametrized by suitable values of ( @xmath99 ) , can be viewed as belonging to a homotopy class of maps .",
    "when we have a continuum of the ( @xmath99 ) or ( @xmath136 ) parameters , we sweep a continuum of orthogonal states located at the four vertices of a rectangle of figure [ fig : fig ] .",
    "the four vertices are all mapped to the four discrete nontrivial zeros @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , living in the four vertices of the rectangle .",
    "one can deform continuously the rectangle containing the four orthogonal states and shrink it in size to zero when all the four vertices collapse to the center of symmetry ( @xmath195 ) .",

    "we will apply this result to the function @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "let us imagine we have a zero off the critical line at @xmath199 , which means that the ( @xmath200 ) values are @xmath201 and @xmath202 , @xmath114 .",
    "the argument of deforming continuously the four vertices of the rectangle , along the diagonals , so they collapse finally to the center of symmetry @xmath203 , after using these equations , can be expressed analytically as : @xmath204 = \\lim\\limits_{a\\to\\infty } z(1/2 ) = z(1/2 + 0i ) .",

    "there is a pole of @xmath206 at @xmath207 and at @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , when the four vertices collapse to the center point @xmath94 , one has found , after looking at the first and last term of ( [ eq : limits ] ) , that @xmath209 .",
    "if @xmath210 is a putative zero off the critical line , this would imply that @xmath211 is equal to zero , which is a contradiction since there is no zero at @xmath212 ( an `` experimental '' fact ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that because the ( homotopy ) deformation does not yield a zero at @xmath94 , we can not have zeros off the critical line at @xmath213 .",
    "notice that from ( [ eq : limits ] ) by using @xmath114 , when @xmath80 goes to @xmath214 , @xmath3 goes to @xmath215 , we can always approach the limits @xmath216 , and @xmath217 , along straight lines in the @xmath218 and @xmath219 planes , respectively , whose finite slope is given by @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively .",
    "for this reason the first and second terms of ( [ eq : limits ] ) are well justified .",
    "the remaining terms of ( [ eq : limits ] ) are justified based on the continuity properties of the function @xmath22 .",
    "naturaly , for fixed @xmath80 ( not equal to @xmath214 ) when @xmath26 goes to @xmath212 we have that @xmath222 since @xmath223 is a fixed point .",
    "notice that in equation ( [ eq : limits ] ) one can have @xmath224 without having @xmath225 nor @xmath134 equal to @xmath226 .",
    "of course , if this equality holds for all values of @xmath134 and @xmath227 , then one must have that @xmath228 due to the fundamental identity @xmath229 .    because there is no zero at @xmath196",
    ", this means that the state associated with @xmath230 is not orthogonal to itself .",
    "so dilating - back the point @xmath230 , which is not an orthogonal state , into a continuum of vertices of a rectangle , we then conclude that the initial four vertices can not be orthogonal states to the vacuum @xmath56 and",
    "since these sates were mapped to the points @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , we conclude that these can not be zeros .",
    "it is impossible to deform continuously the slopes of the diagonals of the rectangles ( given by the zeros ) because this will be tantamount of saying that the zeros ( the slopes ) can vary continuously .",
    "the slopes can only change in discrete jumps if , and only if , the zeros are discrete . then , we can not continuously deform the rectangle shown in figure [ fig : fig ] into rectangles of narrower and narrower width , and of increasing height , which collapse to the vertical critical riemann line in the limit of zero width and infinite height . for this reason we can have zeros at the critical vertical line without having a zero at the center of symmetry @xmath233 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the diagonals and the center point @xmath234 belong to different homotopy classes than the critical vertical line .    in order to deform the center of symmetry @xmath235 onto points belonging to the critical vertical line",
    ", it is necessary to have a family of rhombuses with two of its vertices located in the critical vertical line , and the other two vertices to lie in the ( positive ) horizontal axis .",
    "these four vertices correspond to putative orthogonal states to the vacuum @xmath236 and must have a one - to - one correspondence to four putative zeros .    if this occurs , then it is possible to deform ( continuously ) the family of rhombuses by varying the @xmath80 parameter ( the @xmath3 ) continuously , in such a way that rhombuses will then collapse into the center symmetry point @xmath223 .",
    "however , to begin with , this procedure is not possible for the simple reason that there are no zeros located in the positive horizontal axis and , hence , there is no such family of rhombuses , in the first place , available to be deformed .",
    "for this reason , it is not possible to deform the center of symmetry @xmath237 onto points belonging to the critical vertical line .    and from this result , that there is no equivalence - deformation among the points along the critical line and the center of symmetry @xmath237",
    ", we conclude that the fact that nontrivial zeros exist at the critical vertical line is indeed compatible with the fact that there is no zero at @xmath237 .",
    "whereas , by deforming the four vertices of the rectangles , along the diagonals , into the center symmetry @xmath237 , implies that the state @xmath238 would have been orthogonal to itself , and a zero at @xmath203 would have been found . since there is no zero at @xmath237 , this implies that the four states living in the four vertices of the rectangles could have not been orthogonal to the vacuum , in the first place , and consequently , there can not be zeros located off the critical riemann line .",
    "for this reason , the core of our proof relies on symmetry considerations and the fact that we have a continuum of differential operators that permits us to vary the location of the orthogonal states continuously along straight lines ( the diagonals of the rectangle in figure [ fig : fig ] ) passing through the center of symmetry .",
    "to complete the final steps of the proof of the rh we show that one can trade - off the symmetries @xmath10 goes to @xmath11 of the function @xmath239 with the symmetries of the `` inner '' products under @xmath240 , which , in turn , is concatenated with the @xmath241 symmetry of the `` orthogonal '' states .",
    "relation ( [ eq : gauss ] ) will be useful to show that the set of orthogonal states to the `` vacuum '' state has the same symmetry of the zeroes of the riemann s zeta function . @xmath242 is defined as a summation over positive integers only , and @xmath243 over all integers and zero .",
    "we can recast relation ( [ eq : gauss ] ) into the following useful form , @xmath244 .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we will choose @xmath245 , so the `` inner '' products are taken w.r.t the @xmath246 vacuum , and later we will study the most general case .",
    "invariance of the `` inner '' product under the inversion symmetry , @xmath18 , and adopting a standard regularization procedure of removing the infinities , yields the well defined finite parts : @xmath150 . if this invariance under inversion holds for all values of @xmath7 and due to the fact that @xmath151 ( except for the trivial case when @xmath247 , @xmath153 ) the only consistent solution , for all values of @xmath7 , has to be @xmath155 due to riemann s fundamental identity @xmath248 .",
    "hence `` orthogonality '' corresponds to finding a zero of zeta @xmath249 inside the critical domain .",
    "the @xmath250 parameters are defined in terms of @xmath113 in the way mentioned above , @xmath251 and @xmath252 , which satisfy the condition @xmath166 equivalent to @xmath253 .",

    "only such inversions allow @xmath257 the physical meaning is clear , @xmath31 is replacing an scaling with a contraction , it is the scaling analog of a `` time reversal transformation '' which is translated as the conjugation @xmath10 goes to @xmath258 .",
    "this is the key to this proof of the rh .    from the mere definition of @xmath259 and the jacobi - gauss relations , one requires , to obey the equality @xmath260 , @xmath261 = t^{- f(s ) + k } e^{v(t ) } , \\label{eq : functionf}\\ ] ] for all values of @xmath262 .",
    "the solutions to the functions @xmath263 are @xmath264 where @xmath265 is real because ( [ eq : functionf ] ) and the gauss - jacobi relations yield @xmath266 , since @xmath267 are real by definition .",
    "and from these conditions it follows that the orthogonal states to the `` vacuum '' state must obey the same symmetries properties as the zeros of zeta , symmetric with respect to the critical line for the particular case @xmath245 , @xmath268 . if @xmath269 is orthogonal to the `` vacuum '' ,",

    "they found that the imaginary parts of the nontrivial riemann zeros can be reproduced using a one - dimensional local - potential model , and that a close look at the potential suggests that it has a fractal structure of dimension d = 1.5 .",
    "the potential found by @xcite has a smooth part and a random part .",
    "we believe that the fluctuating part of the potential may be determined by using an infinite product of weierstraas `` devil '' fractal functions , continuous but nowhere differentiable .",

    "what ties all these identities together based on the above concatenation of three transformations , is nothing but the fundamental identity @xmath359 and the gauss - jacobi relations ( after regularization ) .",
    "of course , we have to use the formula of @xcite ( after dropping the infinities ) and insert the factors of 2 due to our summation over the integers from @xmath360 to @xmath361 .",
    "one further remark is in order .",
    "even if we fix the values of @xmath7 , the symmetry - invariance of the `` inner '' products under inversions @xmath5 goes to @xmath6 still gives @xmath362 .",
    "if we fix the values of @xmath26 of the `` orthogonal '' states , one still has the freedom to vary in continuous manner the @xmath363 parameters , i.e the @xmath364 coefficients which appear inside the arguments of the @xmath365 functions . if the above equation holds for all values of @xmath363 ( for all values of @xmath250 ) , and since @xmath10 is not equal to @xmath366 in general , then the only possibility to obey the above equality , for all values of @xmath363 or @xmath367 is to have @xmath368 due to the fundamental identity @xmath369 . and once more , for fixed values of @xmath7 , we still can trade - off the @xmath10 goes for @xmath11 symmetry for the inversions @xmath240 symmetry .",

    "\\3 . adopting a standard regularization program of dropping the infinities and retaining the well defined terms @xmath372 in the integrals of the book @xcite .    \\4 . for the particular case",
