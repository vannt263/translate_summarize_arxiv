    "the electronic properties of mesoscopic systems have been studied experimentally and theoretically for many years .",
    "more recently the behavior of other excitations , for example lattice vibrations ( phonons ) and spin degrees of freedom , have come under study in these systems . in this paper we present results relevant to the issues of heat transport by phonons and the dissipation of vibrational modes in mesoscopic systems .",
    "the interest in heat transport by phonons in mesoscopic systems arises because for easily fabricated devices the wavelength of a typical thermal phonon becomes comparable to the dimension of the thermal pathway at accessible temperatures of order @xmath1 . thus _",
    "quantized _ thermal transport due to the discrete mode structure of the thermal pathway should become evident . we @xcite and others @xcite showed that this leads to a natural quantum unit of thermal conductance @xmath2 similar to the role of @xmath3 as a quantum of electrical conductance in one dimensional wires @xcite .",
    "this quantum unit of thermal conductance is predicted @xcite to be clearly observable at low enough temperatures where only the acoustic @xmath4 ) vibrational modes are excited in the thermal pathway  the waveguide - like modes with nonzero frequency cutoffs at long wavelengths are populated with exponentially small numbers : a universal thermal conductance is predicted equal to @xmath5 with @xmath6 the number of acoustic modes ( @xmath7 for a freely suspended beam of material , corresponding to a longitudinal mode , two bending modes and a torsional mode ) .",
    "these predictions were recently verified in beautiful experiments by schwab et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "vibrational modes in mesoscopic systems are found to have anomalously low @xmath0 values , compared to larger systems of the same material @xcite . at first sight",
    ", the dissipation might be expected to become smaller as the oscillator becomes smaller , since defects such as dislocations are eliminated when the size gets less than a typical defect separation .",
    "thus the observation of lower values of @xmath0 was a surprise .",
    "in addition , unexpected dependencies on temperature @xcite and magnetic field @xcite have been observed and remain unexplained .",
    "both the possibility of observing the universal thermal conductance and explanations for the @xmath0 of small resonators involve the properties of phonon excitations with a wavelength comparable to the system size . here",
    "we investigate a particular issue relevant to both these questions , namely the coupling of vibrational modes across an abrupt junction between two blocks of the same material but with different dimensions .",

    "the `` bridge '' is made of silicon , silicon nitride or gallium arsenide , is freely floating , and is of rectangular cross section .",
    "the bridge is connected to two larger blocks of the same semiconductor . in thermal conduction experiments the block at one end , called the cavity , is also freely floating ( and is physically supported by four bridges ) and is of the same thickness .",
    "the block at the other end provides both the mechanical support and a thermal reservoir . in recent experiments @xcite the dimensions",
    "were : thickness @xmath8 ; width @xmath9 ; length @xmath10 . in vibration experiments",
    "the bridge may be supported just at one end ( a cantilever ) @xcite or at both ends ( a beam ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an important question in both thermal transport and oscillator damping experiments is the coupling of the vibrational modes of the bridge to modes in the supports  how well the energy in a mode in the bridge is transmitted to the supports , and vice versa .",
    "we have previously introduced a simple scalar model of the elastic waves to study this question in the context of thermal transport @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give a more realistic description of the vibrational modes .",
    "first , in section [ secscalar ] , we introduce an improved scalar model , using a better choice for the boundary conditions on the scalar field that provides a more realistic approximation to the waves in an elastic medium . the scalar model in its revised form provides a useful first guide to the expected behavior of the experimental system , and a simpler environment in which to develop intuition and methods of theoretical attack . with the scalar model we perform a complete calculation of the scattering of the waves at the abrupt junction between the bridge and the supports for all the modes and at all wave vectors .",
    "we use the resulting transmission coefficients to evaluate the effect of the abrupt junction on the thermal conductance , particularly the universal low temperature expression .",
    "in addition we introduce a simple method to calculate the transmission coefficients for the long wave length acoustic modes , and compare the results with the general results . in the full elastic calculation",
    "we will not be able to calculate the transmission coefficient for full range of modes , but will be restricted to this type of long wavelength calculation .",
    "secondly we propose that the elasticity theory for a thin plate geometry provides a useful semiquantitative description of the experimental geometry .",
    "this is described in section [ sec_thinplate ] . the full elasticity theory for the modes in the two dimensional ,",
    "thin plate geometry is sufficiently tractable that a complete mode spectrum is readily calculated . on the other hand , a fully three dimensional elasticity theory",
    "can only be attacked purely numerically .",
    "the two dimensional theory reproduces many important features of a fully three dimensional elasticity theory , for example the mixing of bulk longitudinal and transverse waves by reflection at boundaries , the correct behavior of the dispersion relation at long wavelength and low frequency , including the `` bending '' modes with the unusual quadratic dispersion @xmath11 at long wavelengths , and regions of negative dispersion in the mode spectra .",
    "thus the results should be more informative than the naive scalar model .",
    "the results should be accurate at sufficiently low temperatures where the modes with structure across the thickness are frozen out .",
    "we use the thin plate model to investigate the mode structure in the beam , and the coupling of these modes to the supports , also treated as thin plates of the same thickness .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_applications ] we apply the results to the issues of heat transport and oscillations in mesoscopic systems .",

    "two thermal masses are connected by four thermal pathways of mesoscopic dimensions in which heat transport by phonons is the dominant mechanism .",
    "one of the thermal masses , which we call the cavity , is a freely suspended thin block of semiconductor , with resistive wires on the upper surface to act as heat source and thermometer .",
    "the four bridges act as the thermal pathway to the outside world , as well as mechanical supports .",
    "conceptually , heat is added to the cavity by resistive heating , and the resulting temperature difference from the reservoir is measured , yielding , for small heating , the thermal conductance of the bridges . in practice issues such as the thermal contact between the electrons in the resistive heater and thermometer and the phonons , and other thermal pathways to the reservoir such as through the electrical contacts to the resistive heaters , have to be considered . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the ideal situation where the phonon thermal pathway of the bridge dominates the conductance .    in mesoscopic systems it is easy to cool to temperatures where the transverse dimensions of the beam are comparable to or smaller than the typical phonon wavelength @xmath12 where @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath14 is planck s constant",
    ", @xmath15 is a typical speed of sound in the material and @xmath16 is the temperature .",
    "when this condition is satisfied the discreet mode structure of the thermal pathway becomes evident ",
    "the first level of the quantization of thermal transport .",
    "angelescu et al.@xcite showed that the thermal conductance takes on a quasi - universal form , largely independent of the material and mode structure of the beam , on the assumption that the contact between the modes in the bridge and the cavity and reservoir can be considered ideal .",
    "an ideal contact implies that the right going phonon modes in the bridge in fig .",
    "( [ fig_geometry ] ) are populated with a thermal distribution at the temperature of the cavity , and the left going modes at the temperature of the reservoir .    in a thermal conductance measurement",
    "the cavity and reservoir are maintained at temperatures @xmath17 and @xmath16 with temperature difference @xmath18 small compared to their mean temperature .",
    "if we first look at the transport by the right moving phonons , the energy flux is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the wave vector along the bridge , @xmath21 is the dispersion relation of the @xmath22th discrete mode of the bridge , and @xmath23 is the group velocity . transforming the integral to an integral over frequencies yields an expression for the heat transport by right moving phonons@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the _ cutoff frequency _ of the @xmath22th mode , i.e. the lowest frequency at which this mode propagates .",
    "( we have assumed the @xmath22th mode propagates to arbitrarily large frequencies .",
    "if a particular mode only propagates over a finite band of frequencies , the upper limit of the integral will be replaced by @xmath26 . ) _ the key simplification in this result is that the group velocity factor is cancelled by the density of states in transforming from an integration over wave numbers to an integration over frequencies . _    for ideal coupling to the reservoirs the distribution function @xmath27 for the right moving phonons in eq .",
    "( [ unscaledmode ] ) is evaluated as the bose distribution at the _ cavity _",
    "temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the thermal conductance is given by subtracting the analogous expression @xmath28 for the left moving phonons given by eq .",
    "( [ unscaledmode ] ) , but now with the distribution @xmath29 given by the bose distribution at the _ reservoir _ temperature @xmath16@xmath30 finally , introducing the scaled frequency variable @xmath31 gives the expression @xcite@xmath32 where @xmath33 is given by the integral@xmath34 equation ( [ eq_conductance ] ) demonstrates the important result that the properties of the bridge only enter through the ratio of the mode cutoff frequencies to the temperature @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 plays the role of the quantum unit of thermal conductance , analogous to the quantum of electrical conductance @xmath3 for one dimensional wires . at very low temperatures",
    "the contribution to the thermal conductance by the modes with nonzero cutoff frequency will be exponentially small leaving a _ universal _ thermal conductance @xcite@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of `` acoustic '' modes , i.e. modes with frequency tending to zero at long wavelengths .",
    "usually this will be _ four _ for the beam ( two transverse bending modes , one longitudinal compressional mode , and a torsional mode ) .",
    "note that there is _ no _ dependence on the bridge properties in this expression .",
    "more generally we can not assume perfect coupling between the modes in the bridge and the cavity and reservoir .",
    "this can be taken into account , following the landauer approach to electrical conductance @xcite , through a transmission coefficient for energy to be transported across the interfaces .",
    "for example for imperfect contact at the cavity bridge interface we would find a thermal conductance ( returning to unscaled quantities in the integral for clarity)@xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy transmission coefficient from the mode @xmath22 of the bridge at frequency @xmath40 into the cavity modes .",
    "imperfect coupling at the bridge - reservoir junction , and elastic scattering due to imperfections in the bridge can be similarly included through a total transmission matrix as in the electron case .",
    "a central issue in predicting the thermal conductance is then to calculate the transmission coefficient @xmath39 .",
    "this is particularly important in the question of the observability of the universal conductance at low temperatures , since the scattering of the long wavelength phonons contributing to this quantity becomes strong ",
    "indeed for the abrupt junction in fig .",
    "( [ fig_geometry ] ) , @xmath41 as @xmath42 as we will see below .",
    "although it is feasible in experiment to `` smooth off '' the corners , as indeed was done in the experiment of schwab et al .",
    "@xcite , consideration of the worst case abrupt junction provides insight into the importance of geometric scattering .",
    "the @xmath0 of an oscillator is given by@xmath43 where @xmath44 is the rate of energy loss from the mode at frequency @xmath40 containing energy @xmath45 .",
    "if we consider the oscillations of a beam supported by two supports , or a cantilever with one support , and estimate the energy loss as the energy transmitted into the supports , we find for the mode @xmath46@xmath47 where @xmath48 is the group velocity of a wave propagating in the beam , and @xmath49 is the length of the beam .",
    "the exact evaluation of this quantity depends on the nature of the mode ( longitudinal , bending etc . ) . for the longitudinal and torsional modes , which have a linear spectrum @xmath50 , the frequency of the fundamental mode in a beam of length @xmath49 is of order @xmath51",
    ", the group velocity is @xmath52 , and so@xmath53 for the bending waves with a quadratic spectrum @xmath11 , the result is more complicated , but the @xmath0 values are similar , and tend to this form for large @xmath46 , so we will use this expression as a fairly accurate general estimate .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ q_transmission ] ) that good isolation of the mode @xmath54 is a criterion for high @xmath0 . in practice",
    "this expression for the dissipation may be an overestimate , since we are assuming that all the energy of the mode that enters the support either dissipates away , or propagates away to large distances so that the energy is not returned to the oscillations of the beam . if this is not the case , the transmission of energy into the support is only one part of the problem  we would also have to consider the behavior of the vibrational energy in the supports as well .",
    "as a simple model of the elasticity problem consider a single scalar field @xmath55 .",
    "this might represent , for example , the ( scalar ) `` displacement '' , and the ( vector ) `` stress '' @xmath56 would then be proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "we will suppose a two dimensional domain corresponding to the thin plate .",
    "this leads to a wave equation@xmath58 with @xmath59 the two dimensional laplacian and @xmath15 giving the speed of propagation of the wave .",
    "stress free boundary conditions at the edges are then @xmath60 with @xmath61 the normal to the edge .",
    "note that this neumann boundary condition allows the propagation of an acoustic mode ( @xmath62 ) in the bridge as we expect for elastic waves , whereas dirichlet boundary conditions do not .",
    "an example of an elastic system described by such a scalar model is a stretched membrane : @xmath55 would then be the displacement normal to the membrane and @xmath63 is the vertical force on a unit line in membrane normal to the direction @xmath64 .",
    "the scalar problem is sufficiently simple that we can calculate the transmission across an abrupt junction such as the cavity to bridge junction in full detail .",
