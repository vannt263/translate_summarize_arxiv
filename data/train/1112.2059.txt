    "in this paper , we develop interest rate models that offer consistent dynamics in the short , medium , and long term . often interest rate models have valid dynamics in the short term , that is to say , over days or perhaps a few weeks .",
    "such models may be appropriate for the pricing of securities with short time - to - maturity . for financial assets with long - term maturities ,",
    "one requires interest rate models with plausible long - term dynamics , which retain their validity over years .",
    "thus the question arises as to how one can create interest rate models which are sensitive to market changes over both short and long time intervals , so that they remain useful for the pricing of securities of various tenors . ideally , one would have at one s disposal interest rate models that allow for consistent pricing of financial instruments expiring within a range of a few minutes up to years , and if necessary over decades .",
    "one can imagine an investor holding a portfolio of securities maturing over various periods of time , perhaps spanning several years .",
    "another situation requiring interest rate models that are valid over short and long terms , is where illiquid long - term fixed - income assets need to be replicated with ( rolled - over ) liquid shorter - term derivatives .",
    "here it is central that the underlying interest rate model possesses consistent dynamics over all periods of time in order to avoid substantial hedging inaccuracy .",
    "insurance companies , or pension funds , holding liabilities over decades might have no other means but to invest in shorter - term derivatives , possibly with maturities of months or a few years , in order to secure enough collateral for their long - term liabilities reserves .",
    "furthermore , such hedges might in turn need second - order liquid short - term protection , and so forth . applying different interest rate models validated for the various investment periods , which frequently do not guarantee price and hedging consistency",
    ", seems undesirable .",
    "instead , we propose a family of pricing kernel models which may generate interest rate dynamics sufficiently flexible to allow for diverse behaviour over short , medium and long periods of time .",
    "we imagine economies , and their associated financial markets , that are exposed to a variety of uncertainties , such as economic , social , political , environmental , or demographic ones .",
    "we model the degree of impact of these underlying factors on an economy ( and financial markets ) at each point in time by combinations of continuous - time stochastic processes of different probability laws .",
    "when designing interest rate models that are sensitive to the states an economy may take , subject to its response to the underlying uncertainty factors , one may wonder a ) how many stochastic factor processes ought to be considered , and b ) what is the combination , or mixture , of factor processes determining the dynamics of an economy and its associated financial market .",
    "it is plausible to assume that the number of stochastic factors and their combined impact on a financial market continuously changes over time , and thus that any interest rate model designed in such a set - up is by nature time - inhomogeneous .",
    "the recipe used to construct interest - rate models within the framework proposed in this paper can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "assume that the response of a financial market to uncertainty is modelled by a family of stochastic processes , e.g. markov processes .",
    "2 .   consider a mixture of such stochastic processes as the basic driver of the resulting interest rate models .",
    "3 .   in order to explicitly design interest rate models ,",
    "apply a method for the modelling of the pricing kernel associated with the economy , which underlies the considered financial market .",
    "4 .   derive the interest rate dynamics directly from the pricing kernel models , or , if more convenient , deduce the interest rate model from the bond price process associated with the constructed pricing kernel .",
    "the set of stochastic processes chosen to model an economy s response to uncertainty , the particular mixture of those , and the pricing kernel model jointly characterize the dynamics of the derived interest rate model .",
    "we welcome these degrees of freedom , for any one of them may abate the shortcoming ( or may amplify the virtues ) of another . for example , one might be constrained to choose lvy processes to model the impact of uncertainty on markets .",
    "the fact that lvy processes are time - homogeneous processes with independent increments , might be seen as a disadvantage for modelling interest rates for long time spans .",
    "however , a time - dependent pricing kernel function may later introduce time - inhomogeneity in the resulting interest rate model .",
    "the choice of a certain set of stochastic processes implicitly determines a particular joint law of the modelled market response to the uncertainty sources .",
    "although the resulting multivariate law may not coincide well with the law of the combined uncertainty impact , the fact that we can directly model a particular mixture of stochastic processes provides the desirable degree of freedom in order to control the dynamical law of the market s response to uncertainty . in this paper",
    ", we consider `` randomised mixing functions '' for the construction of multivariate interest rate models with distinct response patterns to short- , medium- , and long - term uncertainties .",
    "having a randomised mixing function enables us to introduce the concept of `` partially - observable mixtures '' of stochastic processes .",
    "we take the view that market agents can not fully observe the actual combination of processes underlying the market .",
    "instead they form best estimates of the randomised mixture given the information they possess ; these estimates are continuously updated as time elapses .",
    "this feature introduces a feedback effect in the constructed pricing models .",
    "the reason why we prefer to propose pricing kernel models in order to generate the dynamics of interest rates , as opposed to modelling the interest rates directly , is that the modelling of the pricing kernel offers an integrated approach to equilibrium asset pricing in general ( see cochrane @xcite , duffie @xcite ) , including risk management and thus the quantification of risk involved in an investment .",
    "the pricing kernel includes the _ quantified _ total response to the uncertainties affecting an economy or , in other words , the risk premium asked by an investor as an incentive for investing in risky assets . in this work",
    "we first consider a particular family of pricing kernel models , namely the flesaker - hughston class ( see flesaker & hughston @xcite , hunt & kennedy @xcite , cairns @xcite , brigo & mercurio @xcite ) . since our goal in this paper is to primarily introduce a framework capable of addressing issues arising in interest rate modelling over short to long term time intervals",
    ", we apply our ideas first to the flesaker - hughston class of pricing kernels .",
    "we conclude the paper by introducing randomised weighted heat kernel models , along the lines of akahori _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and akahori & macrina @xcite , which extend the class of pricing kernels developed in the first part of this paper .",
