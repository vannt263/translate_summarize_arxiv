    "a few xmd galaxies , for example , i  zw  18 and sbs   0335@xmath13052 e and w , where there is no evidence for an old stellar population , are considered as good candidates for young galaxies in the local universe .",
    "in general , however , old stellar populations have been found in most ( of the as of yet small numbers ) of well - studied xmd galaxies . despite the presence of an older stellar population ,",
    "the very low ism metallicities of xmds indicate that they are relatively unevolved systems .",
    "further evidence for their relatively unevolved status comes from the fact that they are very gas rich ; neutral hydrogen is often the dominant baryonic component in these galaxies .",

    "the blue colour and the very low metallicity of sbs  1129 + 576 both are indicative of a relatively young age for the dominant stellar population . however , as is generally the case with very low metallicity galaxies , the spectroscopic and photometric data do not allow one to rule out models in which the galaxy contains stellar populations as old as 10  gyr , albeit with the majority of the current luminosity coming from a much younger ( @xmath2100  myr ) population .    @xcite ( 1999 )",

    "the sao 6-m telescope spectrum ( unpublished ) for this object as well as its sdss dr3 spectrum show an h@xmath34 emission line with ew  =  28   , a faint [ ] @xmath525007 line and balmer absorption lines in blue . according to the starburst-99 models of @xcite ( 1999 ) , for an instantaneous starburst with the metallicity @xmath53  =  0.0004 and a standard salpeter imf ,",
    "all of these features are consistent with a star formation episode with an age of @xmath220  myr .",
    "this age is larger but comparable with that of the starbursts in sbs  1129 + 576 and sbs  1129 + 577 .",
    "for sdss  j113227.68 + 572142.3 , the peak column density ( at a resolution of @xmath28  arcsec or 1  kpc ) is @xmath23.9  @xmath3  10@xmath19  atoms  @xmath11 , corresponding to a deprojected total gas column density of @xmath24.0  @xmath3  10@xmath19  atoms  @xmath11 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath22 below the nominal star formation threshold .",
    "we note that @xcite also found that star formation in very faint dwarf galaxies does occur at gas column densitites approximately two times lower than the nominal threshold density .",
    "the size of the galaxy is comparable to our beam size , even at the highest resolution ( i.e. @xmath28  arcsec ) .",
    "it is thus very likely that our observed peak column density is a severe underestimate of the true column density .",
    "it is possible that the star formation in sdss j113227.68 + 572142.3 was triggered by the accretion of a small amount of gas onto a gas - poor ( dwarf elliptical ? ) progenitor .",
    "deeper observations may help to confirm or rule out this hypothesis .",
    "the sbs  1129 + 576/577 system is morphologically very similar to  1225 + 01 ( @xcite 1992 , @xcite ) .",
    "both systems consist of two components with a bridge between the two . in both systems ,",
    "the southern component is almost edge - on , whereas the northern component is more face - on .",
    "the finger at the south - western edge of sbs  1129 + 576 is a countertail similar to that in the south - western component of  1225 + 01 .",
    "the north - east clump of  1225 + 01 has a bar as sbs  1129 + 577 does have .",

    "sbs  1129 + 576 , like the south - western component in  1225 + 01 , is on a prograde orbit .",
    "the masses of the less - massive components in both systems are similar ( where we assume a distance of 15  mpc to  1225 + 01 ) .",
    "the ratio of the masses of the two components is , however , different , with a value of @xmath21:1.9 for  1225 + 01 and @xmath21:4.3 for sbs  1129 + 576/577 . in computing these ratios",
    ", we assume that in the bridges originally belonged to less - massive components .",
    "the major difference between the systems sbs  1129 + 576/577 and  1225 + 01 is that no optical counterpart has been found in south - west clump of  1225 + 01 to a limiting surface brightness of 27.0 @xmath15-mag  arcsec@xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the environments of these systems . @xcite ( 1992 )",
    "found that there is no dwarf galaxy within @xmath21  mpc of  1225 + 01 , while the nearest luminous galaxy is at @xmath21.2  mpc from it ( for an adopted distance of 15  mpc ) .",

    "there are several galaxies at the projected distances of 150500 kpc with the velocities in the range @xmath217001800  km  s@xmath17  ( including a rather luminous sb(s)c galaxy ngc  3683 , with @xmath57 of @xmath1319.6  mag ) , but their radial velocities imply that all of them are more than @xmath22  mpc away from the sbs  1129 + 576/577 system .",
    "there are four dwarf galaxies with radial velocities from 1450 to 1565  km  s@xmath17  at the projected distances of @xmath2350400 kpc . the nearest luminous galaxy with close radial velocity is ngc  3619 ( @xmath5819.5  mag ) at @xmath20.8  mpc .",
    "we conclude that both systems are at a distance of @xmath21  mpc from the nearest luminous galaxies and at several hundred kpc from the nearest dwarf galaxy .",
    "sbs  0335 - 052 ( @xcite 2001a ) is another interesting object to compare to the sbs  1129 + 576/577 system .",
    "both the components , sbs  0335@xmath13052 e and w , at a projected distance of 22  kpc ( @xcite 2001a ) are candidate young galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; pustilnik , pramskij & kniazev 2004 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the envelope surrounding these components is similar to the one seen in sbs  1129 + 576/577 system .",
    "its total gas mass is comparable to that of sbs  1129 + 577 ( i.e. @xmath210@xmath6  m@xmath7 ) .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of sbs  0335 - 052 in and at other wavelengths suggest that the most plausible interpretation of this system is a merger .",
    "the progenitors are either extremely unevolved very gas - rich objects or protogalaxies .",
    "their mutual tidal interaction has triggered the current bursts of star formation .",
    "the peak measured column densities are 1.0  @xmath3  10@xmath10 and 0.7  @xmath3  10@xmath10  atoms  @xmath11 in the west and east components , respectively , at a linear resolution of 5.4  @xmath3  3.9  kpc .",
    "this system , however , seems to be not very isolated , lying at the outskirts of the loose group lgg 103 .",

    "similarly , the current starburst in the low - metallicity galaxy hs  0822 + 3542 appears to be triggered by interaction with its companion sao  0822 + 3545 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite for an alternative interpretation ) . for i  zw  18 , an xmd system with the second - lowest known metallicity",
    ", there is an extended distribution with four distinct components ( @xcite ) , only two of which have optical counterparts .    interpreting the observed configuration of sbs  1129 + 576 as the first close encounter ( as is for the case of  1225 + 01 )",
    ", we would expect that the significant exchange of matter has not yet taken place .",
    "this is consistent with the large difference of metallicities ( o / h differ by a factor of @xmath23 , or 0.5  dex ) .",
    "as noted by @xcite , in some of the probable xmd mergers , which are at more advanced stages , the differences in o / h in different components are significantly smaller .",
    "this is consistent with the gas exchange leading to a more homogeneous composition of ism in the merging components towards the late stages of merger .",
    "in particular , for hs  0122 + 0743 ( @xcite ; pustilnik et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , in which optical components are in contact , o / h differs by less than 0.1  dex . on the other hand , for sbs  0335052 e and w , which seem to have their first close encounter",
    "the situation appears to be more complicated .",
    "while the galaxies are not expected to have exchanged much gas , their o / h differs by only 0.17 dex .",
    "this may be the result of the metal - enrichment by the first star formation episodes in both components leading to a typical value of z  @xmath21/30  z@xmath7 ( @xcite ) . summarising the comparison of sbs  1129 + 576 with several other xmd bcgs",
    ", we find that the tidal - interaction - triggered star formation is a common theme for all of them .",
    "we summarise our conclusions about this study of the metal - poor galaxy sbs  1129 + 576 and its immediate surroundings as follows :    1 .",
    "sbs  1129 + 576 is undergoing a strong interaction with the nearby dwarf galaxy sbs  1129 + 577 .",
    "we assume that has been pulled out from it to form a bridge between the two galaxies .",
    "the mass of in the bridge is 2.1  @xmath3 10@xmath4  m@xmath7 , roughly half the mass remaining in the disc of sbs  1129 + 576 .",
    "the observed morphology of the system suggests that it is in a prograde orbit .",
    "the system is probably on its first encounter and no significant exchange of material has taken place yet .",
    "this is consistent with the very different ism metallicities of the two systems .",
    "the enhanced star formation in these gas - rich galaxies ( @xmath47/l@xmath32 of 2.1 and 3.8 ) has very likely been triggered by mutual tidal interaction .",
    "2 .   the two peaks in sbs 1129 + 576 are at face - on surface densities of @xmath21.5  @xmath3  10@xmath10 and @xmath21.7  @xmath3  10@xmath10  atoms  @xmath11 .",
    "these coincide with the positions of the two brightest regions , respectively .",
    "the face - on column density in regions identified in sbs  1129 + 577 using the slit spectroscopy is above @xmath21.8  @xmath3  10  @xmath10  atoms  @xmath11 .",
    "this is similar in value to the threshold density for star formation seen in other bcgs .",
    "3 .   sbs  1129 + 577 has a central bar with a ring surrounding it , while the outer gas has been distorted into a strong one - armed spiral pattern .",
    "these are also likely to be consequences of the tidal interaction .",
    "the velocity field of sbs  1129 + 577 shows that the disc is warped in the outer region , while in the inner region the gas orbits appear to be non - circular , probably as a response to the potential of the central bar .",
    "there is a hint of an integral - shaped warp in the inner parts of disc of sbs  1129 + 576 .",
    "the system has a third dwarf galaxy with mass of 1.1@xmath310@xmath9 m@xmath7 .",
    "it has an @xmath47/l@xmath32 value of 0.08 , that is , much lower than those for its more - massive companions .",
    "while the optical spectrum of this galaxy indicates a recent star - formation episode ( @xmath220 myr , comparable to that for starburst ages in sbs  1129 + 576 and sbs  1129 + 577 ) , its low @xmath47/l@xmath32 suggests that it has had a very different evolutionary history .",
    "it is further unusual in having ongoing star formation , despite having a peak observed gas column density lower than the nominal threshold for star formation .",
    "we note , however , the true column density may be considerably higher than that derived from our comparatively low poor resolution maps .",
    "the system sbs  1129 + 576/577 is similar in many aspects to two other well - known xmd systems .",
    "these are  1225 + 01 and sbs  0335052 e and w , where the current star burst appears to have been triggered by tidal interaction .    _ acknowledgment .",
