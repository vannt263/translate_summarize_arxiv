    "we consider 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath0-deformed minkowski space - time @xmath1 , with the commutation relation @xmath2}={{\\rm i}}{\\theta}^{\\mu\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the space - time coordinates ( cf .",

    "the non - commutativity parameter @xmath3 is assumed to be constant and in order to avoid difficulties with time - ordering in the field theory , we choose the special case where @xmath4 . in order to construct the perturbative field theory formulation ,",
    "it is more convenient to use fields @xmath5 ( which are functions of ordinary commuting coordinates ) instead of operator valued objects like @xmath6 .",

    "one can then represent the original operator multiplication in terms of star products of symbols as @xmath9\\star s\\left[\\hat{g}\\right]\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in using the weyl - ordered symbol ( which corresponds to the weyl - ordering prescription of the operators ) one arrives at the following definition of the weyl - moyal @xmath10-product ( @xmath11(x)\\to a(x)$ ] ) : @xmath12 it has the important property of invariance under cyclic permutations of the integral @xmath13 moreover , bilinear terms are unaffected by the star product : @xmath14 for a field theory this means that interaction vertices gain phases , whereas propagators remain unchanged . in constructing feynman graphs one",
    "hence has to deal with so - called planar and non - planar diagrams  @xcite . while planar diagrams have the same ultraviolet divergences known from commutative field theory , the non - planar ones are finite due to phase factors .",
    "a simple example of an integral appearing in non - planar graphs is @xmath15 it is obvious , that the phases act as uv - regulators , but since this regulating effect can only take place for non - vanishing @xmath16 , a new infrared divergence appears as @xmath17 .",
    "this is the origin of the _ uv / ir mixing _",
    "problem  @xcite .    here",
    "we would like to consider a non - commutative @xmath18 gauge theory action @xmath19 where the field tensor @xmath20}\\ ] ] is endowed with a non - abelian structure due to the star product . as shown by several authors",
    "@xcite , this action leads to an ir singular vacuum polarization , whose quadratic ir divergent term @xmath21 is gauge fixing independent .",
    "obviously , graphs with this insertion are ir divergent .",
    "in order to get rid of ir divergences , slavnov  @xcite has proposed a modification of yang - mills theories , adding to the action a term @xmath22 in doing this , a constraint @xmath23 is implemented which has the effect of making the gauge field propagator transversal with respect to @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "hence , ir divergent feynman graphs such as the one depicted in figure  [ fig : insertion ] become _",
    "finite_.        there is , however , a catch : even though @xmath26 is introduced as a lagrange multiplier implementing a constraint , it becomes a dynamical field . or to be more precise : one has additional feynman rules , namely a @xmath26-propagator , a mixed @xmath27-propagator and a @xmath28-vertex , and hence numerous additional feynman graphs . since the additional propagators are not transversal with respect to @xmath24 , slavnovs trick does not work for certain diagrams , i.e. the one depicted in figure  [ fig : insert-2loop ] .",
    "let us now discuss special features of the gauge fixed action including the slavnov term : in order to avoid unitarity problems  @xcite we choose the non - commutativity tensor spacelike , i.e. @xmath29 furthermore , we choose the gauge fixing to be of an axial type  @xcite with gauge fixing vector in the plane of the non - commutative coordinates : @xmath30 with these choices the slavnov term , together with the gauge fixing terms , have the form of a 2-dimensional topological bf model ( cf .  @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the covariant derivative @xmath33}\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "the action @xmath34 is invariant under the brst symmetry @xmath35 \\ , ,   & & sb = 0 \\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & sc   =    \\frac{{{\\rm i}}g}{2 }   \\ , [ c , c ] \\ , , & & s^2=0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have omitted the stars , and the commutators are considered to be graded by the ghost - number .",
    "additionally , the gauge fixed action is also invariant under a ( non - physical ) _ linear vector supersymmetry ( vsusy ) _ , whose field transformations are @xmath36 since the operator @xmath37 lowers the ghost - number by one unit , it represents an antiderivation ( very much like the brst operator @xmath38 which raises the ghost - number by one unit ) .",
    "* note : * _ only the interplay of appropriate choices for @xmath3 and @xmath39 lead to the existence of the vsusy .",
    "_    in contrast to the pure topological theories , we have an additional vectorial symmetry : @xmath40 this further symmetry is in fact a ( non - linear ) symmetry of the gauge invariant action .",
    "its existence is due to the presence of the yang - mills part of the action which , in contrast to the bf - type part of the action , involves also @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "notice that the algebra involving @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath43 and the ( @xmath44)-plane translation generator @xmath45 closes on - shell ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we shall now discuss the consequences of the linear vsusy : the generating functional @xmath46 of the connected green functions is given by the legendre transform of the generating functional @xmath47 of the one - particle irreducible green functions . at the classical level ( tree graph approximation ) one has @xmath48 , and hence the ward identity describing the linear vector supersymmetry in terms of @xmath46 in the tree graph approximation is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 are sources of @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "varying this expression with respect to @xmath52 and @xmath53 yields for the gauge field propagator : @xmath54{$\\delta_{a_ia_\\mu}=0$}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , as soon as one of its indices is either 1 or 2 , the gauge field propagator is zero . as the @xmath28-vertex is proportional to @xmath55 ,",
    "which here is non - vanishing only in the ( @xmath44)-plane , relation ( [ prop - relation ] ) has the following important consequence for the feynman graphs : _ the combination of gauge boson propagator and @xmath28 vertex is zero _ ( see figure  [ fig : vertex - prop ] ) .",
    "-vertex contracted with a photon propagator vanishes . ]",
    "furthermore , it is impossible to construct a closed loop including a @xmath28-vertex without having such a combination somewhere . _ hence , all loop graphs involving the @xmath28-vertex vanish ! _",
    "in particular , dangerous vacuum polarization insertions as in figure  [ fig : insert-2loop ] vanish .",
    "this is the reason , why the model is free of the most dangerous , i.e. the quadratic , infrared singularities , as pointed out by slavnov  @xcite for the special case of @xmath56 .",
    "in this section we would like to discuss the question whether we can show cancellation of ir singular feynman graphs for a more general choice of @xmath57 and @xmath39 .",
    "the answer is yes , but we need to impose stronger slavnov constraints .",
    "the initial slavnov constraint was @xmath58 . with `` stronger '' we mean that each term in the sum should vanish seperately .",
    "upon imposing these stronger conditions we may write for the action  @xcite : @xmath59,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 .",
    "this action looks like a 3 dimensional bf model coupled to maxwell theory . as in the pure bf - case ,",
    "the action has two gauge symmetries @xmath61}\\,,\\qquad & & { \\delta}_{g2}{\\lambda}_k = d_k\\lambda'\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar to the previous model , we have an additional bosonic vector symmetry of the gauge invariant action : @xmath62 there is , however , a difference to the previous case : the additional vectorial symmetry is broken when fixing the second gauge symmetry @xmath63 .",
    "if we consider a space - like axial gauge fixing of the form}$ ] is the redefined multiplier field fixing the second gauge freedom @xmath63 . ]",
    "@xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the gauge fixed action is invariant under the linear vsusy @xmath65 in addition to the usual brst invariance .",
    "the ward identity describing the linear vector supersymmetry in terms of @xmath46 at the classical level is given by @xmath66=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the same arguments as before show the absence of ir singular graphs .",
    "however , the model exhibits numerous further symmetries which have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "one should also note , that a generalization to higher dimensional models is possible .",
    "for example if @xmath26 had @xmath67 indices the vsusy would become @xmath68 after appropriate redefinitions of lagrange multipliers .",
    "slavnov - extended yang mills theory can be shown to be free of the worst infrared singularities , if the slavnov term is of bf - type .",
    "furthermore , supersymmetry , in the form of vsusy , seems to play a decisive role in theories which are not poincar supersymmetric .",
    "open questions are :    * what is the role of vsusy with respect to uv / ir mixing in topological ncgft in general ?",
    "* what are the consequences of the additional symmetries appearing in these models ?",
