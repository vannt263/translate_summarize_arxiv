    "an elliptical stadium is a two - parameter planar domain constructed by adding symmetrically two half - ellipses to the opposite sides of a rectangle . in the corresponding elliptical stadium billiard , the point particle is moving with constant velocity within this boundary , exhibiting specular reflections on the walls .",
    "this billiard is a generalization of the bunimovich stadium billiard with circular arcs@xcite , which is fully ergodic for any length of the central rectangle .",
    "when the semicircles are replaced by half - ellipses , a plethora of new dynamical properties emerges , ranging from exact integrability , through mixed dynamics with a single chaotic component or with a finely fragmented phase space , to broad regions of fully developed chaos .",
    "thanks to these properties the elliptical stadium billiard can be considered a paradigmatic example of a hamiltonian dynamical system , which convincingly illustrates both gradual and abrupt transitions induced by the parameter variation .    to appreciate these advantages ,",
    "the system should be looked at as a whole .",
    "several descriptions of the elliptical stadium billiard can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , although detailed and mathematically rigorous , they concentrate on some specific billiard properties and consider only restricted parameter regions . therefore in the present analysis",
    "we take into account all possible boundary shapes and investigate the properties of the elliptical stadium billiard in the full parameter space spanned by two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "some of the preliminary results for special cases with the present parametrization were described in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the elliptical stadium is a closed planar domain , whose boundary in the @xmath3 plane is defined by means of two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , satisfying the conditions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is symmetrical with respect to the x- and y - axis and is described in our parametrization as    @xmath6    the meaning of parameters is visible from fig .",
    "the horizontal diameter is normalized to 2 .",
    "the vertical semiaxis of the ellipse is @xmath1 , and the height @xmath7 of the billiard extends from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the horizontal length of the central rectangle is @xmath10 , and the horizontal semiaxis of the ellipse is @xmath11 .",
    "the limiting boundary subclasses for some specific parameter combinations are as follows . for @xmath12",
    "the shape is elliptical , for @xmath13 it is rectangular . especially , for @xmath14 it is a square , and for @xmath12 and @xmath15 a circle . for @xmath2",
    "one obtains the bunimovich stadia@xcite with different lengths of the central rectangle , which define the border separating two distinct boundary classes , one for @xmath16 with elongated semiellipses , and the other with @xmath17 and flattened semiellipses .",
    "another interesting case is @xmath18 , where the central rectangle is a square , and whose properties were briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "the focal points differ for the two classes . for @xmath17",
    "there are four foci at the points    @xmath19 , \\ ] ]    and for @xmath16 the two foci are situated at the points    @xmath20 .\\ ] ]    these expressions enhance the importance of the term @xmath21 which is negative for @xmath16 , positive for @xmath17 , and zero for @xmath2 ( bunimovich stadium ) . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the curvature radius is    @xmath23^{3/2 } } { \\gamma(1-\\delta)^4 } .\\ ] ]    for @xmath24 the boundary is flat and the curvature radius is @xmath25 . at the endpoints of the horizontal and the vertical axis of the ellipse the curvature radius is @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "it is @xmath28 for the circular arcs of the bunimovich stadium .",
    "2 shows some typical shapes of the elliptical stadia for @xmath0 between 0 and 1 and for @xmath1 between 0.25 and 1.5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 can have any value between zero and infinity .",
    "however , at @xmath29 the boundary degenerates into a line , and the values of @xmath1 greater than 1.5 do not introduce any essentially new features .",
    "dynamics of a classical planar billiard can be examined by calculating the points on the billiard boundary where impacts and elastic reflections of the particle take place .",
    "1(b ) shows the meaning of variables describing an impact and appearing in the conditions for existence and stability of orbits .",
    "symbols @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , denote the angles which the directions of the incoming and the outcoming path make with the x - axis .",
    "the normal to the boundary at the impact point t closes the angle @xmath32 with the x - axis .",
    "the angle between the normal and the incoming ( or outcoming ) path is @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the angle between the tangent to the boundary at the impact point t@xmath35 and the incoming ( or outcoming ) path .",
    "the slope of the normal to the boundary at the impact point is given as the negative inverse derivative @xmath36 .",
    "for the iterative numerical computation of the impact points it is useful to know the relation between the slopes of the incident and the outgoing path , expressed as    @xmath37    in our numerical computations , two separate sets of data were obtained : coordinates @xmath38 of the impact points on the billiard boundary , needed for the graphical presentation of the orbits and for the computations of the orbit stability , and coordinates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , suitable for the graphical presentation of the poincar ' e sections .",
    "the points p@xmath41 in the poincar ' e diagrams are obtained by plotting as @xmath39 the x - coordinate of the point s in which the rectilinear path segment crosses the x - axis , and as @xmath42 the projection of the velocity on the x - axis . with an additional assumption concerning the horizontal diametral orbit ( explained in iii.b ) the poincar ' e sections",
    "are thus completely defined . as some orbit segments",
    "do not cross the x - axis , the number of points in the poincar ' e diagram can be smaller than the number of the impact points on the boundary . in our chosen system of units the mass and the velocity of the particle are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , hence both @xmath39 and @xmath40 lie in the interval [ -1,1 ] . for billiards with noncircular boundary segments@xcite such variables are computationally more convenient than those containing the arc length variable suitable for the billiard boundaries with circular arcs@xcite .",
    "since @xmath39 and @xmath40 are canonically conjugated variables and our billiard is a hamiltonian system which reduces to the collision - to - collision symplectic twist map , the phase space and the corresponding poincar ' e sections are area preserving .    depending on the choice of the shape parameters and on initial conditions ,",
    "one obtains three types of orbits : periodic orbits , which define fixed points in the poincar ' e diagram ; quasiperiodic orbits which define invariant curves surrounding the fixed points , and chaotic orbits which fill densely a part of the phase space .",
    "as described in @xcite , periodic orbits can be stable ( elliptic ) , unstable ( hyperbolic ) and neutral ( parabolic ) . to discern these properties for the elliptical stadium billiard",
    ", we use the criterion stated in @xcite , by which the stability of an orbit is assured if the absolute value of the trace of the deviation matrix @xmath45 is smaller than 2 , thus if    @xmath46    the deviation matrix of the closed orbit of period @xmath47 can be written as @xmath48 , where the @xmath49 matrix @xmath50 for two subsequent impact points t@xmath51 and t@xmath52 , connected by a rectilinear path ( the chord ) of the length @xmath53 , is @xcite    @xmath54    to examine the properties of the elliptical stadium billiard in the full parameter space , one may proceed by scanning the complete array of @xmath0 and @xmath1 values .",
    "however , it is often sufficient to make use of a restricted , conveniently defined , one - parameter subspace .",
    "depending on the property considered , we choose among the following possibilities : constant @xmath0 and changing @xmath1 , constant @xmath1 and changing @xmath0 as in @xcite , or @xmath18 as in @xcite .",
    "this subfamily of elliptical stadia has elongated semiellipses .",
    "the corresponding billiards have been investigated in @xcite , with the principal aim to establish the limiting shapes beyond which the billiard is fully chaotic .",
    "parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 used there to describe the boundary are connected with our parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 through relations    @xmath57    the results reported in @xcite suggest that in the parameter space there exists a lower limit above which the billiard is chaotic , as consequence of the existence of the stable pantographic orbits . in fig .",
    "3 results of our numerical calculations of the poincar ' e sections are shown for @xmath58 and different values of @xmath59 .",
    "this example conveniently illustrates the behavior typical for this region of the parameter space .",
    "numerous elliptic islands arising from the stable pantographic orbits can be recognized .",
    "the islands due to some other types of orbits are also visible .",
    "typical orbits contributing to these pictures are shown in fig .",
    "4 , for @xmath58 and increasing values of @xmath1 .",
    "the lowest two pantographic orbits , the bow - tie orbit ( @xmath60 ) and the candy orbit ( @xmath61 ) , are shown in figs .",
    "4(f ) and 4(h ) , respectively .",
    "three higher period pantographic orbits are seen in figures 4(a ) , 4(c ) and 4(d ) .",
    "some other types of orbits are depicted in figs .",
    "4(b ) , 4(e ) and 4(g ) .    in @xcite , an earlier conjecture of donnay@xcite , stating that the lower limit of chaos is set by relations @xmath62 and @xmath63 , was investigated . in our parametrization",
    "this region is delimited by functions    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    in order to visualize the segmentation of the parameter space into regions of different dynamical behavior , in fig .",
    "5(a ) we plot the pairs of shape parameters as points in the @xmath1 - @xmath0 diagram .",
    "possible parameter choices are situated within an infinitely long horizontal band of height 1 .",
    "the tilted line connecting the points ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,0 ) holds for bunimovich stadia .",
    "the points below and above this line , respectively , are the elongated and the flattened elliptical stadia .",
    "the region delimited by functions ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) is visible as a narow quasi - triangular area denoted by d in fig .",
    "the obtuse angle of this quasi - triangle is situated at the point @xmath67 , @xmath68 . in a recent paper del magno and",
    "markarian@xcite proved exactly that for this region of the parameter space the elliptical stadium billiard is fully chaotic ( ergodic with k- and bernoulli properties ) .",
    "however , there are strong indications that the lowest limit of chaoticity is not consistent with this line .",
    "it can be probably identified with the limit derived in @xcite , separating regions b and c in fig .",
    "5(a ) and resulting from the onset of the stable pantographic orbits .",
    "whereas the lower limit of the region d consists of two parts , this new limit is made of an infinite number of shorter segments , corresponding to all possible pantographic indices @xmath47@xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations based on the box - counting method ( described in the next section ) confirm the chaoticity of the region c and identify the border between regions b and c in the parameter space as the lower limit of chaos .",
    "another conspicuous feature of billiards with @xmath16 is the stickiness of certain orbits and consequent fragmentation of the chaotic part of the phase space into two or more separate sections .",
    "this occurs below a certain limiting combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the exact shape of this limit is not obvious .",
    "it is probably connected with the straight line @xmath69 , pointed out in @xcite , separating in fig .",
    "5(a ) the region a from the region b , which can be blamed to the discontinuities in the boundary curvature at the points where the flat parts join the elliptical arcs .",
    "similar phenomena have been noticed in various billiards with circular arcs@xcite .",
    "this part of the parameter space , comprising the flat half - ellipses , had not been investigated previously , except for the brief analysis in @xcite , later cited in @xcite . as an example of the typical behavior , the poincar ' e sections for @xmath58 and various @xmath70",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "6 . here appear some new types of orbits and we examine their existence and stability .",
    "these are the diametral orbits ( horizontal , vertical and tilted ) of period two , the hour - glass orbit of period four , the diamond orbit of period four , as well as the whole family of multidiamond orbits . in our further description , we will refer to the impact coordinates @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the first quadrant ( instead of @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , with no loss of generality for the obtained results , due to the symmetries of the boundary and of the considered orbits .",
    "the horizontal two - bounce orbit obviously exists for all combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , the trace of the deviation matrix@xcite is equal to    @xmath75 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 , so that the stability condition ( 6 ) reads    @xmath78    hence the two - bounce horizontal diametral orbit becomes stable for    @xmath79    thus , there is a bifurcation at the value @xmath80 giving birth to the stable diametral orbit .",
    "again we choose @xmath58 as a typical example , and keeping it constant we notice that for this value of @xmath0 the upper limit of chaos is @xmath81",
    ". in the region @xmath82 , denoted in fig .",
    "5(a ) by e , there are no periodic orbits , and this is the region of full chaoticity .",
    "this result has been proved in @xcite , among results for several chaotic billiards , and later cited in a discussion of the elliptical stadium billiards @xcite .",
    "( it should be mentioned that for this case the definition of the shape parameter in @xcite differs from that in eqs.(8 ) . )    in the poincar ' e plot , the invariant points of the horizontal diametral orbit are defined as @xmath83 , since this orbit can be understood as a limiting case of a long and thin horizontal hour - glass orbit , which will be discussed below in more detail .",
    "the poincar ' e diagrams in fig . 6",
    "show that the corresponding elliptic island arising for higher values of @xmath1 above the @xmath84 line develops into a broad band filled with invariant curves .",
    "the corresponding orbit will be shown below in fig .",
    "11(a ) .    here",

    "thereby the chord length @xmath104 in ( 20 ) should be replaced by    @xmath105    where    @xmath106    the trace of the deviation matrix is then    @xmath107\\ ] ]    with @xmath77 .",

    "they have lost the symmetry of the hour - glass orbit , but in the mutual relation to each other retain the left - right mirroring symmetry ( figs .",
    "11(g ) and 11(h ) ) .",
    "this type of behavior , known as the pitchfork bifurcation , has been encountered in limaon billiards@xcite .",
    "in this section we return to the question of limits within which the elliptical stadium billiard is fully chaotic . for @xmath17 ,",
    "our numerical calculations of the billiard dynamics confirmed the result of @xcite , stating that the billiard is chaotic for @xmath82 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the billiard is fully chaotic for the narrow region determined by ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) below the bunimovich line @xmath2 . in @xcite",
    "this band was conjectured to be much broader , and its lower limit attributed to the emergence of the stable pantographic orbits .    here",
    "we propose to test these limits numerically , by means of the box - counting method .",
    "we calculate the poincar ' e sections for a chosen pair of shape parameters , starting with 5000 randomly chosen sets of initial conditions and iterating each orbit for 100 intersections with the x - axis , thus obtaining 500000 points ( @xmath39,@xmath40 ) in the poincar ' e diagram . having in mind the symmetry of the billiard , we plot the absolute values ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 ) of the computed pairs .",
    "then we divide the obtained diagram into a grid of small squares of side 0.01 , count the number @xmath47 of squares which have points in them and calculate the ratio of this number to the total number @xmath139 of squares .",
    "the obtained ratio @xmath140 is denoted by @xmath141 and determines the fraction of the chaotic region in the poincar ' e section . in this way",
    "also certain points belonging to invariant curves within the regular islands are included .",
    "however , their contribution is negligible in comparison with the considerably larger chaotic contribution , since the average number of points per square is 50 and our principal aim is to examine the onset of complete chaos .",
    "numerically , the size of the box has been varied until the saturation of @xmath140 ratio was achieved , providing a consistent and reliable method of analysis of the set obtained in the numerical experiment .",
    "we proceed by calculating the chaotic fraction for a constant value of @xmath0 and varying @xmath1 .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "12 , where the classical chaotic fraction @xmath142 is plotted against @xmath1 for a set of values of @xmath0 .",
    "these pictures show that for each @xmath0 there exist pronounced lower and upper limits of the fully chaotic region , characterized by @xmath143 .",
    "when one plots these limits in the parameter space diagram in fig .",
    "5(a ) , one obtains two curves , the upper one within the region @xmath17 , which coincides with eq .",
    "( 14 ) and separates the region e from region f , and the lower one in the region @xmath16 , separating regions b and c. thus our numerical experiments confirmed the existence of both limits , the lower one determined in @xcite from the pantographic orbits , and the upper one suggested in @xcite .",
    "outside this fully chaotic region ( consisting of regions c , d and e in fig .",
    "5(a ) ) , the value of the fraction @xmath141 is characterized by oscillations following the parameter variation , called in @xcite the `` breathing chaos '' . at some values",
    "there are strong discontinuities , which can be traced to bifurcations of various orbits .",
    "the elliptical stadium billiard can also be considered as a two - dimensional quantal system . the schr \" odinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath144 moving freely within the two - dimensional billiard boundary is identical to the helmholtz equation for the wave function @xmath145    @xmath146    where @xmath147 is the particle energy .",
    "the usual transformation to dimensionless variables is equivalent to substituting    @xmath148    which yields    @xmath149\\psi(x , y)=0 .\\ ] ]    we solve this equation following the method of ridell @xcite and , using the expansion in the spherical bessel functions @xcite , obtain the wave functions and energy levels within the preselected energy interval .",
    "the described method yields about 500 - 3000 levels , depending on the shape .      according to @xcite ,",
    "statistical properties of the energy spectrum reflect the degree of chaoticity in the corresponding classical system .",
    "for the elliptical stadium billiard it would be interesting to see whether the quantal calculation confirms the existence of the region of fully developed chaos , in the sense of the conjecture of bohigas , giannoni and schmit@xcite.to assess this correspondence , we calculate the spectrum and wave functions for a given pair of shape parameters .",
    "the obtained spectrum is then unfolded using the method of french and wong@xcite and the resulting histograms are analyzed by means of the nearest neighbor spacing distribution method ( nnsd ) . to fit the numerically calculated distributions , we propose three possibilities : the brody distribution@xcite , the berry - robnik distribution @xcite , and a two - parameter generalization of both brody and berry - robnik distributions    @xmath150 + \\nonumber\\\\   \\nonumber\\\\ + { \\rm e}^{-(1-q)s}q \\left [ 2(1-q)+\\alpha(\\omega+1)q^{\\omega+1}s^{\\omega }   \\right ] { \\rm e}^{-\\alpha q^{\\omega+1}s^{\\omega+1}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which we shall henceforth call the prosen - robnik ( pr ) distribution . for @xmath151",

    "it coincides with wigner distribution if @xmath151 and @xmath153 , and with the poisson distribution whenever @xmath154 . here",

    "relation between the level spacing distribution @xmath163 and the gap distribution is @xmath164 .",
    "the function ( 44 ) has been evaluated in @xcite and was used to test the spectra of several types of the billiards of mixed type@xcite . fitting the calculated histograms to this distribution gives two parameters @xmath165 and @xmath166 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the resulting value of @xmath165 is the variable which corresponds to the classical @xmath141 , the magnitude of the chaotic fraction of the phase space .",
    "this distribution gives more realistic results than the brody or the berry - robnik distribution .",
    "the berry - robnik and brody distributions have different behavior for very small spacings : brody distribution vanishes at @xmath167 , whereas for the berry - robnik distribution @xmath168 .",
    "besides , the berry - robnik parameter @xmath169 has a well defined physical meaning : quantitatively it is the fraction of the phase space which is filled with chaotic trajectories , whereas the remaining regular fraction of the phase space is equal to @xmath170 .",
    "however , the berry - robnik distribution is exactly applicable only in the semiclassical limit , and we are exploring the complete spectrum , including the lowest lying levels",
    ".    in @xcite prosen and robnik argue that distribution ( 44 ) describes simultaneously transition from semiclassical to quantal regime and transition from integrability to chaos .",
    "the two parameters @xmath171 and @xmath169 characterize these two transitions , respectively , so that @xmath169 retains its meaning as the chaotic fraction of the phase space , but is applicable also to cases far from the semiclassical limit .",
    "the diagram of ( 44 ) in dependence on @xmath171 and @xmath169 has been presented in @xcite .    in applying the generalized distribution ( 44 ) to the billiard ( 1 ) we hold both parameters @xmath171 and @xmath169 within the limits [ 0,1 ] .",
    "we choose the subset of elliptical stadium billiards with @xmath18 , and in figs .",
    "13(a)-13(k ) we show the histograms and their fit with @xmath172 . in the region where @xmath18 lies between 0.44 and 0.63",
    "the distribution is very close to wigner and @xmath173 .",
    "according to @xcite this would correspond to the complete classical chaos . in fig .",
    "13(l ) some obtained values of @xmath165 are shown in dependence on @xmath0 and compared with the classical result obtained with the box - counting method .",
    "the values obtained with the brody and berry - robnik distributions are also shown .    to the question whether the fluctuations of @xmath141 with gradual changes in shape parameter reflect on the quantal values of @xmath169 outside the chaotic region , the answer is positive , but requires further investigation .",
    "considering the importance of bifurcations examined in section iii , one can expect the effects similar to those found in the oval billiard@xcite .",
    "in this work we have explored classical and quantal dynamics of the elliptical stadium billiards in the full two - parameter space , analyzing two distinct groups of these billiards , separated from each other by the set of bunimovich billiards .",
    "for @xmath16 we have confirmed the important role of the pantographic orbits in establishing the lower bound for chaos .",
    "for @xmath17 we have analyzed in detail the diametral two - bounce orbits and the diamond and multidiamond orbits of increasing periodicity , creating numerous new corresponding elliptic islands when the value @xmath13 is approached .",
    "especially interesting is the behavior of the hour - glass orbit which is , while remaining stable within a large range of increasing values of @xmath1 , accompanied with a resonant belt with changing periodicity . at the value where the orbit becomes unstable ,",
    "a bifurcation to a pair of stable quasi - hour - glass orbits with distorted symmetry appear .",
    "the upper limit of chaos @xmath80 is obtained by estimating the stability of the horizontal two - bounce orbit , and coincides with the limit proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have thus numerically confirmed the existence of a broad region of chaos in the parameter space surrounding the straight line belonging to the bunimovich stadia .",
    "thereby the most important dynamical phenomena of the elliptical stadium billiards in the full parameter space are revealed .",
    "there remains , however , the open question of the stickiness of orbits in the region @xmath16 , the fragmentation of the phase space and its connection with the discontinuities of the boundary curvature , and possible importance of the limiting straight line @xmath69 . one possible method to resolve",
    "this is to analyze the statistics and the phase space properties of the leaking billiards @xcite .",
    "preliminary investigations show promising results , and should be able to explain the foliation and the fragmentation of the phase space of the elliptical stadium billiard .    in conclusion",
    ", our investigation has revealed dynamical properties of a large two - parameter family of stadium - like billiards exhibiting a rich variety of integrable , mixed and chaotic behavior , in dependence on two shape parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with the special case of @xmath2 corresponding to the bunimovich stadium billiard @xcite .",
    "the proposed billiard shapes and obtained results could serve as an additional testing ground for the experimental properties of semiconducting optical devices and microwave resonant cavities .",
