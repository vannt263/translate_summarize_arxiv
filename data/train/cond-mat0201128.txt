    "al _ confirmed @xcite , that in a case of slight quench ( small @xmath3 ) , the equilibrium proceeds through the usual nucleation mechanism .",
    "however , lack of the macroscopic order parameter ( like the average magnetization in the ising system below @xmath4 ) in the both initial and final states hinders precise measurement of the nucleation time in this regime .",
    "we simulate relaxation of the metastable states , which are induced in the potts ferromagnet near the first order phase transition driven by the external magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the heat - bath dynamics is used to thermalize spins .",
    "nucleation time is measured as the function of the applied field at @xmath1 for @xmath6 .",
    "one can say , that for small @xmath0 , @xmath7 , the line @xmath8 in the potts model represents the liquid - vapour phase transition , and it simulates the liquid - solid transition for large @xmath0 , @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted , that the langer s theory of nucleation @xcite based on the coarse - grained free - energy functional can not be applied in the latter case @xcite .",
    "so , our aim is to identify in the potts model the nucleation regimes well - known in the ising model , and to study how they are modified by increase of @xmath0 .",

    "the candidate spins to flip have been chosen sequentially : site by site in the row , and row by row in the lattice .",
    "we define the nucleation time @xmath63 as the number of sweeps through the lattice after which the number of spins in the initial ( metastable ) phase reduces to @xmath64 .",

    ", the nucleation time fluctuates very much .",
    "so , we had to average the nucleation time in this regime over 100 or even 1000 runs .",
    "it is important to note , that for @xmath51 the relation between the nucleation time @xmath63 and the total relaxation time @xmath67 is not straightforward and is different in different regimes .",
    "a typical time dependence of the order parameters @xmath19 in the first nucleation regime for @xmath68 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . since the fall of the magnetization @xmath69 is very rapid compared with the time which the system has spent in the metastable state , the nucleation time @xmath63 and the total relaxation time @xmath67 are essentially the same in this regime .",
    "this is true also in the second nucleation regime . in the latter case , however , the system can fall with equal probabilities to one of the equilibrium states , either @xmath70 , or @xmath71 .",
    "2 shows a typical time evolution of the magnetization in the first coalescence regime . up to the saturation at 1 ,",
    "the magnetization @xmath72 increases approximately linearly with time due to the steady expansion of many stable phase droplets .",
    "thus , the system reaches equilibrium in about two nucleation times : @xmath73 .",
    "the situation is quite different in the second coalescence regime , see fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    "many critical droplets of the both equilibrium phases @xmath74 and @xmath70 are initially generated in the lattice .",
    "they expand and expel the metastable @xmath58 phase from the system in about two nucleation times .",
    "the resulting state is still far from the equilibrium , since the lattice is divided into domains of two stable phases @xmath70 and @xmath71 . during the final ( very slow at low temperatures ) stage of the relaxation ,",
    "these two phases compete , until one of them will expel another from the system .",
    "so , the nucleation time @xmath63 and the total relaxation time @xmath67 may be of different order of magnitude in the second coalescence regime .",
    "our simulations were restricted to the temperature @xmath1 and the lattice sizes @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we have started from the @xmath42 potts model , which is equivalent to the ising model .",
    "this provides a good possibility to verify efficiency of the applied simulation scheme , since nucleation in the ising model has been thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the nucleation time in the logscale for the @xmath42 potts ( ising ) model .",
    "pluses correspond to the nucleation time averaged over 1000 runs in the @xmath65 lattice .",

    "three relaxation regimes are clearly identified : the strong field regime ( sfr ) , the coalescence regime ( cr ) , and the nucleation regime ( nr ) .",
    "increase of the lattice size does not change the nucleation time in the strong field and coalescence regimes .",
    "the nucleation regime was not observed in the @xmath66 lattice in the studied region of fields @xmath45 . in the nucleation regime",
    ", the nucleation time fluctuates very much , and the distribution @xmath78 of these fluctuations is described by the simple exponential law : @xmath79 for this distribution , the averaged time equals to the dispersion : @xmath80= \\tau $ ] .",
    "this is indeed observed in the @xmath65 lattice at @xmath81 indicating well established nucleation regime in this field region .",
    "the theoretical prediction for the averaged nucleation time in the nucleation regime with the wulff s shape droplet is given by equation ( [ tcor ] ) , where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the upper straight line in fig .",
    "4 shows the nucleation theory exponent , and the second ( curved ) line plots the the same exponent corrected by the prefactor @xmath84 , i.e. equation ( [ tcor ] ) .",
    "though the latter curve contains only one free parameter - the constant factor @xmath85 - it fits well the numerical simulation points for the @xmath65 lattice in the nucleation regime , much better then the first ( straight ) line .",
    "the curved line gives also a good fit for the dispersion points in the small @xmath65 lattice not only in the nucleation region , but also at crossover to the coalescence regime down to @xmath86 .",
    "the possible explanation of this result may be the following .",
    "measured nucleation time @xmath63 consists of two terms @xmath87 , which have the same order of magnitude in the crossover region .",
    "the first term relates to the time of nucleation of the first critical droplet in the system , and the second term denotes the time of the expansion of this droplet to @xmath88 of the whole lattice .",
    "the first term should strongly fluctuate according to the exponential law ( [ texp ] ) .",
    "if the second term @xmath89 fluctuates much weaker , one should have for the total time dispersion : @xmath76=d[t_n+t_e ] \\approx d[t_n]=\\langle t_n \\rangle = \\tau,\\ ] ] where the averaged time @xmath90 of the first droplet nucleation is still given by equation ( [ tcor ] ) .",
    "thus , in the crossover region , dependence ( [ tcor ] ) should fit better the time dispersion points @xmath75 $ ] , than the averaged time @xmath91 , which is indeed observed .",
    "the first numerical verification of the magnetic field dependence of the prefactor in ( [ tcor ] ) for the two - dimensional ising model has been reported by rikvold _",
    "al _ @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the value @xmath82 was confirmed at @xmath92 for the metropolis dynamics with randomly chosen sites .",
    "however , a smaller value @xmath93 was observed in @xcite , when the sites in the lattice were chosen sequentially . though we have also used the sequential chose of sites in the lattice ,",
    "our data for the nucleation time in the nucleation region are better fitted by ( [ tcor ] ) with the prefactor exponent @xmath82 , rather then @xmath94 , see fig .",
    "this is more clear for the dispersion @xmath75 $ ] ( crosses in fig .",
    "5 ) , since the latter is still described by ( [ tcor ] ) at the crossover to the coalescence regime .",
    "the lower straight line is the best linear fit for the nucleation time in the larger @xmath66 lattice in the coalescence regime ( cr ) .",
    "the ratio of slopes @xmath95 of two straight lines in fig . 4 corresponding to the nucleation and coalescence regimes is much smaller than @xmath96 , expected from the theory in the small @xmath45 limit .",
    "however , we are still far from the well - established small @xmath45 limit , as it is evident from the considerable difference between first and second lines in fig .",
    "if one takes this into account , this disagreement of the observed @xmath95 value with @xmath96 expected in the @xmath97 limit becomes not so surprising .",
    "figures 6 - 10 show the observed dependence of the nucleation time on the inverse field @xmath98 in the @xmath99 potts models , @xmath100 in the first @xmath101 and second @xmath102 regimes .",
    "pluses correspond to the nucleation time averaged over 100 runs in the smaller lattice .",
    "crosses indicate nucleation time in the @xmath66 lattice . only the second regime @xmath102 has been studied in the @xmath103 potts model , since the nucleation time in the first regime @xmath101 becomes too long in this case , see equation ( [ tratio ] ) below .",
    "qualitatively , the magnetic field dependence of the nucleation time in all cases is similar to that in the ising model . the same three field regions ( srf , nr , cr ) have been observed . as in the ising case ,",
    "the nucleation regime was realized only in the smaller lattice , @xmath65 . in the latter regime",
    ", the relaxation time strongly fluctuates .    in all cases , @xmath104 behaves linearly with @xmath105 in the nucleation regime ( nr ) , in agreement with the classical nucleation theory . in the @xmath68 and @xmath106 systems the observed slopes ( @xmath107 ) in nr agree with the circle shape of the critical droplets",
    "however , in the @xmath103 model our data indicate the square critical droplet shape , see fig .",
    "10 , and table [ ta ] .",
    "the ratio of slopes in nucleation and coalescence regimes varies from @xmath108 in the @xmath68 , @xmath101 case , down to @xmath109 in the @xmath106 , @xmath102 case . as in the @xmath42 model , these values are lower than @xmath96 predicted by the theory .    in the first nucleation regime ( @xmath101 ) , the nucleating critical droplet should be of the single equilibrium phase @xmath58 , whereas in the second nucleation regime ( @xmath102 ) , a critical droplet of either of @xmath61 equilibrium phases @xmath110 provides relaxation .",
    "so , it is naturally to expect , that nucleation time @xmath111 in the first nucleation regime will be longer , that the nucleation time @xmath112 in the second nucleation regime , and @xmath113 the observed ratios @xmath114 determined from the circle droplet fits in fig .",
    "6 - 9 @xmath115 are in a good agreement with ( [ tratio ] ) .",
    "we have simulated nucleation in the @xmath0-state potts model on the square lattice for @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the nucleation time have been measured in two regimes ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) at @xmath116 for two lattice sizes @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the strong field regime , coalescence regime , and nucleation regime are clearly identified .",
    "the observed magnetic field dependencies of the nucleation time is in agreement with the classical nucleation theory , if one takes into account the anisotropy of the critical droplet shape .",
    "our numerical data indicate , that the shape of the critical droplet changes from ( roughly ) circle towards square with increasing @xmath0 at the fixed temperature @xmath1 .",
    "a similar result was observed by bikker _",
    "@xcite in numerical calculations of the equilibrium crystal shape in the three - dimensional potts model .",
    "so , increase of @xmath0 has a similar effect on the equilibrium droplet shape , as decrease of temperature .",
    "this is natural , since the both reduce the correlation length , which should increase anisotropy in the system .",
    "the ratio of ( @xmath117 ) slopes in nucleation and coalescence regimes does not approach 3 , predicted by the theory in the @xmath118 limit .",
    "we associate this discrepancy with the finite-@xmath45 corrections , which are still considerable in the studied region of the magnetic field .    though @xmath119 and @xmath120 state potts models have different type phase transitions at @xmath4 ( continuous for @xmath119 and first order for @xmath120 ) , metastable phases in these models relax to the equilibrium in a similar way .",
