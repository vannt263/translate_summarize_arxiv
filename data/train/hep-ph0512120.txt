    "the charm - anticharm production in photo- and hadroproduction is known as one of the crucial tests of conventional gluon distributions within a standard factorization approach . at high energies",
    "one tests gluon distributions at low values of longitudinal momentum fraction . at leading order of collinear approach the heavy quark and heavy antiquark",
    "are produced back to back i.e. the azimuthal correlation function is proportional to @xmath4 and the distribution in @xmath5 ( heavy quark transverse momentum ) and @xmath6 ( heavy antiquark transverse momentum ) is proportional to @xmath7 . in collinear approach",
    "this changes only in next - to - leading order . in unintegrated gluon distribution approach the azimuthal angle and @xmath8 decorrelations",
    "are obtained already in leading order of perturbative expansion .",
    "different models of ugdf were presented in the literature .",
    "recently we have tested some of the models in photoproduction @xcite . here",
    "we shall discuss in detail the case of hadroproduction .",
    "it was realized recently that the understanding of transverse momenta can be a clue to understand many high energy reactions . in some reactions like meson hadroproduction , prompt photon and drell - yan production or single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) the transverse momenta",
    "are not obtained dynamically but are included `` by hand '' with gaussian smearing ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter of the smearing is assumed to be independent of longitudinal momentum fraction and is usually arbitrarily chosen or adjusted to a selected set of data .    in some of high - energy reactions that involve gluons",
    "the unintegrated gluon distributions are modelled or are obtained as a solution of some ( usually simplified ) qcd evolution equations .",
    "in particular , the charm - anticharm hadroproduction is considered as one of the flag processes for the so - called @xmath9-factorization approach @xcite .",
    "there are already a few phenomenological trials to calculate the charm or bottom production within the @xmath9-factorization approach @xcite .",
    "the results of these trials differ considerably due to completely different ugdfs used .",
    "in the present paper we shall compare different approaches how to include transverse momenta proposed in the literature for the charm - anticharm pair production at the tevatron energy w = 1.96 gev both for the single charm / anticharm distributions as well as for a few charm - anticharm correlation observables .",
    "let us consider the reaction @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are heavy quark and heavy antiquark , respectively . in the leading - order ( lo ) approximation within collinear approach the triple - differential cross section in rapidity of @xmath11 ( @xmath13 ) , in rapidity of @xmath12 ( @xmath14 ) and transverse momentum of one of them ( @xmath15 )",
    "can be written as @xmath16 above @xmath17 and @xmath18 are familiar ( integrated ) parton distributions in hadron @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "there are two types of lo @xmath21 subprocesses which enter eq.([lo_collinear ] ) : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the first mechanism dominates at large energies and the second near the threshold .",
    "the parton distributions are evaluated at : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the formulae for matrix element squared averaged over initial and summed over final spin polarizations can be found e.g. in ref.@xcite .",
    "if one allows for transverse momenta of the initial partons , the sum of transverse momenta of the final @xmath11 and @xmath12 no longer cancels . formula ( [ lo_collinear ] ) can be easily generalized if one allows for the initial parton transverse momenta .",
    "then @xmath27 where now @xmath28 and @xmath29 are so - called unintegrated parton distributions . , + ( b ) @xmath30 . ]",
    "the extra integration is over transverse momenta of the initial partons .",
    "the two extra factors @xmath31 attached to the integration over @xmath32 and @xmath33 instead over @xmath34 and @xmath35 as in the conventional relation between unintegrated ( @xmath36 ) and integrated ( @xmath37 ) parton distributions . the two - dimensional dirac delta function assures momentum conservation .",
    "now the unintegrated parton distributions must be evaluated at : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . in general , the matrix element must be calculated for initial off - shell partons .",
    "the corresponding formulae for initial gluons were calculated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the present paper for illustration",
    "we shall compare results obtained for both on - shell and off - shell matrix elements .",

    "@xmath46 this formula is very useful to study correlations between the produced heavy quark @xmath11 and heavy antiquark @xmath12 .",
    "for example @xmath47 in the last equation we have introduced @xmath48 , where @xmath49 ( -2@xmath50 , 2@xmath50 ) .",
    "the factor 4 @xmath50 comes from the integration over @xmath51 .",
    "the first factor 1/2 comes from the jacobian transformation while the second factor 1/2 takes into account an extra extension of the domain when using @xmath52 and @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    at the tevatron energy",
    "the contribution of the @xmath22 subrocess is more than order of magnitude larger than its counterpart for the @xmath23 subprocess .",
    "therefore in the following we shall take into account only gluon - gluon fusion process i.e. i=0 and j=0 .",
    "the quark - antiquark mechanism is important only at small center - of - mass energies .    in lo",
    "collinear approach @xmath56 a deviation from this relation is therefore a measure of the initial gluon ( parton ) transverse momenta .",
    "purely perturbative @xmath57-factorization formalism to @xmath58 applies if @xmath59 .",
    "the choice of @xmath60 is to large extent arbitrary . in refs.@xcite",
    "a rather large @xmath60 was chosen and the space @xmath61 was subdivided into four disjoint regions .",
    "for example the contribution when both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are small was replaced by the leading - order collinear cross section . such an approach by construction assures that @xmath64(collinear lo ) .",
    "+ it is rather obvious that the total cross section strongly depends on the choice of @xmath60 .",
    "our philosophy here is different .",
    "many models of ugdf in the literature treat the soft region explicitly .",
    "therefore we use the @xmath57-factorization formula everywhere on the @xmath61 plane . for perturbatively generated ugdfs , like kmr @xcite for instance , we shall extrapolate the perturbative behaviour into the soft region .",
    "thus our approach guarantees a smooth behaviour on the @xmath61 plane and reduces arbitrariness in dividing the two - dimensional gluon - transverse - momentum space .",
    "obtaining ugdfs from underlying qcd is not an easy task .",
    "the main reason is the difficulty in separating out the perturbative from nonperturbative domains .",
    "the nonperturbative domain is difficult _ per se_. even in perturbative region different schemes of resummation have been proposed . in this section",
    "we describe briefly some representative ugdfs from the literature used in the present paper to calculate charm - anticharm production .",
    "kwieciski has shown that the evolution equations for unintegrated parton distributions takes a particularly simple form in the variable conjugated to the parton transverse momentum .",
    "the two possible representations are interrelated via fourier - bessel transform @xmath65 the index k above numerates either gluons ( k=0 ) , quarks ( k@xmath66 0 ) or antiquarks ( k@xmath67 0 ) .    in the impact - parameter space",
    "the kwieciski equation takes a rather simple ( diagonal in b ) form @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the perturbative solutions @xmath68 do not include nonperturbative effects such as , for instance , intrinsic transverse momenta of partons in colliding hadrons .",
    "one of the reasons is e.g. internal motion of constituents of the proton . in order to include such effects",
    "we modify the perturbative solution @xmath69 and write the modified parton distributions @xmath70 in the simple factorized form @xmath71 in the present study we shall use the following functional form for the nonperturbative form factor @xmath72 in eq.([formfactor ] ) @xmath73 is the only free parameter .    in the following we use leading - order integrated parton distributions from ref.@xcite as the initial condition for qcd evolution .",
    "the set of integro - differential equations in b - space is solved by the method based on the discretisation made with the help of the chebyshev polynomials ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "then the unintegrated parton distributions @xmath74 are put on a grid in @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 and the grid was used in practical applications for chebyshev interpolation . in our practical application",
    "we need rather gluon distributions in momentum space .",
    "the latter are obtained via fourier transform ( [ fourier ] ) from @xmath74 .",

    "different prescriptions for @xmath81 have been used in the literature .",
    "the most popular choice @xmath82 corresponds to the angular ordering in the gluon emission .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the unintegrated gluon density given by ( [ kmr_master ] ) starts only at @xmath83 @xcite , i.e. in the perturbative domain . at lower @xmath84",
    "an extrapolation is needed .",
    "a use of the grv integrated gluon distribution @xcite in ( [ kmr_master ] ) seems more adequate than any other gluon distribution because it allows to go down to small gluon transverse momenta .",
    "following ref.@xcite @xmath85 = 0.5 gev@xmath86 is taken as the lowest value where the unintegrated gluon distribution is calculated from eq.([kmr_master ] ) .",
    "below it is assumed @xmath87 in general , the quantity @xmath85 can be treated as a free nonperturbative parameter .    the choice of @xmath80 in our case of charmed quark - antiquark production is not completely obvious . in the present analysis , because we limit to not too large quark / antiquark transverse momenta , @xmath88 is taken for simplicity .",
    "this allows to prepare a two - dimensional grid @xmath89 to be used for further interpolation in the @xmath57-factorization formula which accelerates the multi - dimensional integrations .",
    "if @xmath90 in eq.([kmr_master ] ) is ignored we shall denote the corresponding gluon distribution as @xmath91 or @xmath92 and call it dglap gluon distribution for brevity .      at very low @xmath75",

    "the remaining parameters were adjusted in @xcite to reproduce with a satisfactory accuracy the gluon distribution which was obtained in @xcite as the numerical solution of the bfkl equation .",
    "it was found that @xmath99 = 1 , @xmath100 = 1.19 and @xmath101 = 0.15 @xcite .",
    "another parametrization of gluon distribution in the proton can be obtained based on the golec - biernat  wsthoff parametrization of the dipole - nucleon cross section with parameters fitted to the hera data .",
    "the dipole - nucleon cross section can be transformed to corresponding unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "the resulting gluon distribution reads @xcite : @xmath102 where @xmath103 from their fit to the data : @xmath104 = 29.12 mb , @xmath105 = 0.41 @xmath106 10@xmath107 , @xmath108 = 0.277 . in order to determine the gluon distribution we take",
    "somewhat arbitrarily @xmath109 = 0.2 .",
    "another parametrization , also based on the idea of gluon saturation , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the gbw approach @xcite , where the dipole - nucleon cross section is parametrized , in the karzeev - levin approach it is the unintegrated gluon distribution which is parametrized . in the following we shall consider the most simplified functional form : @xmath110 the saturation momentum @xmath111 is parametrized exactly as in the gbw model @xmath112 1 gev@xmath86 @xmath113 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath114 was adjusted in @xcite to roughly describe the hera data .      for better understanding we shall compare our results with the results obtained with a simple unintegrated gluon distribution : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a standard collinear ( integrated ) gluon distribution and @xmath117 is a gaussian two - dimensional function : @xmath118 such a phenomenological procedure is often used to improve collinear calculations for small transverse momenta @xcite .",

    "in the present analysis we shall discuss both inclusive spectra of charm quarks / antiquarks as well as correlations between quark and antiquark . in order to obtain the integrated cross section a 7-dimensional integration has to be performed .",
    "we have carefully explored the 7-dimensional phase space in order to optimize the integration .",
    "if not otherwise stated we take the whole range of quark / antiquark rapidities : -6 @xmath120 6 and -6 @xmath121 6 .",
    "let us start from single particle spectra of charm quarks . in fig.[fig",
    ": dsig_dpt_gauss ] we demonstrate the effect of gluon transverse momentum gaussian smearing on final quark transverse momentum distribution for w = 1.96 tev , i.e. at the present tevatron energy .",
    "the smearing of primordial gluon distributions causses only a mild broadening of the charm quark - antiquark spectra .",
    "there is almost no difference if off - shell kinematics is used instead of on - shell one that is usually used in the case of the ad hoc gaussian smearing .    in fig.[fig :",

    "the resulting effect is rather mild .",
    "the off - shell matrix elements necessary for the @xmath57-factorization approach were calculated only for some selected reactions . according to our knowledge it was never shown quantitatively in the literature what is actual difference if the off - shell matrix element is replaced by its on - shell counterpart . in fig.[fig : dsig_dpt_kwiec_onshellme_offshellme ] we present results for the kwieciski ugdf for both on - shell and off - shell matrix elements . for this observable",
    "the use of the off - shell matrix element causes only a small enhancement compared to the use of the on - shell matrix element .    in fig.[fig : dsig_dpt_ugdf ] we collected results obtained with different unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature . in this case",
    "consequently the off - shell matrix element and off - shell kinematics were used .",
    "the gbw gluon distribution leads to much smaller cross section .",
    "the kl gluon distribution produces the hardest @xmath15 spectrum .",
    "rather different slopes in transverse momentum of @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 ) are obtained for different ugdfs .",
    "this differences survive after convoluting the inclusive quark / antiquark spectra with fragmentation functions . thus , in principle , precise distribution in transverse momentum of charmed mesons should be useful to select a `` correct '' model of ugdf .",
    "a detailed comparison with the experimental data requires , however , a detailed knoweledge of fragmentation functions .",
    "the inclusive spectra are not the best observables to test ugdf @xcite .",
    "let us come now to correlations between charm quark and charm antiquark .",
    "the azimuthal angle correlation is the most popular observable in this context .",
    "there is a trivial relation between the relative azimuthal angle distribution and the average transverse momenta of gluons .",

    "( see e.g.@xcite ) and off - shell ( see e.g.@xcite ) kinematics is used .",
    "our calculation shows that there is almost no difference whether on - shell or off - shell kinematics is applied . in fig.[fig : dsig_dphi_kwiec_b0 ] we show the angular correlations for the kwieciski ugdf for different values of the @xmath73 parameter .",
    "the effect here is smaller than for the simple gaussian smearing .",
    "this is due to the fact that here the perturbative broadening is included explicitly and the parameter @xmath73 takes into account only nonperturbative part .",
    "the use of on - shell matrix elements instead of off - shell ones leads to slightly stronger back - to - back correlations .    in fig.[fig : dsig_dphi_ugdf ] we compare results for different unintegrated gluon distribution from the literature .",
    "quite different results are obtained for different ugdf .",
    "the nonperturbative gbw glue leads to strong azimuthal correlations between @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "in contrast , bfkl dynamics leads to strong decorrelations of azimuthal angles of charm and anticharm quarks . the saturation - idea inspired kl distribution , as well as bfkl and kmr distributions lead to an local enhancement for @xmath127 0 which is probably due to gluon splitting s - channel subprocess . in the last case",
    "there is a sizeable difference between the result obtained with on - shell ( left panel ) and off - shell ( right panel ) matrix elements .",
    "gluon distribution obtained by the kmr method and the kl and bfkl distributions generate very similar shapes in azimuthal angle .",
    "the gluon distribution obtained by the solution of the kwieciski equation gives somewhat narrower distribution around @xmath128 .",
    "the initial state gluon transverse momentum is also responsible for the decorrelation of the charm quark , charm antiquark transverse momenta . in the case of absence of any gluon transverse momenta in leading - order collinear approximation @xmath129 .",
    "the effect of transverse momenta is shown in fig.[fig : maps ] for different unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature .",
    "although the main strength is concentrated along the diagonal @xmath129 , there is a smearing over whole two - dimensional space of @xmath130 .",
    "as for the case of azimuthal correlations , different pattern can be observed for different ugdf .",
    "in general , the shape of the two - dimensional map is governed by the ugdf used and the matrix element squared .",
    "it is of interest to unfold these two effects . in fig.[fig : matrix2 ] we show an average matrix element squared ( obtained with the help of bfkl ugdf ) in the @xmath130 space .",
    "a rather weak dependence can be observed which means that ugdf is the crucial element responsible for the variation of the cross section in the @xmath130 space .",
    "we compare the on - shell ( left panel ) and off - shell ( right panel ) matrix elements squared averaged with ugdf over the phase space .",
    "in contrast to the more inclusive cases considered above , here the difference is quite sizeable . in fig.[fig : off - shell - to - on - shell ] we present the corresponding ratio of both two - dimensional functions .",
    "what is the origin of populating the asymmetric final state configurations ?",

    "the smallest values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 are obtained along the diagonal ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "this means that along diagonal the soft nonperturbative part of ugdf is tested .",
    "the larger distance from the diagonal , the larger @xmath62 and @xmath63 are sampled .",
    "the kmr is known to have long tails in gluon transverse momenta .",

    "the kmr and kl have largest fractions of asymmetric initial state configurations .",
    "the almost vanishing fraction of asymmetric configurations for gbw glue is due to a lack of pqcd effects .",
    "a rather schematic kl distribution includes the hard components only in a simple parametric form .",
    "our purely model discussion here is a bit academic because initial state configurations are not directly the observables .",
    "therefore the effect of the large tails in ugdfs can be only tested indirectly by studying asymmetric configurations in the final state ( charmed mesons , muons ) space @xmath130 .",
    "the decorrelation in @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be also studied in the collinear next - to - leading order approach .",
    "it is worth to stress here , however , that collinear approach even in higher order approximation is unreliable in the region @xmath141 . in order to avoid conceptual and/or numerical problems asymmetric cuts on jets transverse momentum",

    "consequently , the shape of inclusive spectra only weakly depends on whether on - shell or off - shell matrix element is used .",
    "in contrast there is a sizeable effect for more exclusive variables , dependent e.g. on the position in the @xmath130 space .",
    "we have shown that the analysis of azimuthal correlations and decorrelations on the @xmath5(c transverse momentum ) x @xmath6(@xmath124 transverse momentum ) plane as well as the combination of both are very promissing to verify ugdf .",
