    "a quantum critical point ( qcp ) occurs in the heavy fermion ( hf ) compound cein@xmath0 under a hydrostatic pressure of @xmath2 = 25 kbar .",
    "this corresponds to a transition at @xmath3 = 0 k from a magnetically ordered to a disordered state .",
    "it was found that at least up to 23 kbar the ground state is antiferromagnetically ordered with a propagation vector @xmath4 . at ambient pressure",
    "the nel temperature is @xmath5 = 10.1 k and the staggered magnetization is @xmath6 = 0.5 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "cein@xmath0 becomes superconducting below @xmath8 = 200 mk in the vicinity of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "more generally , the appearance of unconventional superconductivity around @xmath2 in hf systems is supposed to be related to the enhancement of magnetic fluctuations when @xmath9 .",
    "cein@xmath0 crystallizes in the cubic aucu@xmath0 structure , and hence the magnetic fluctuations are expected to be three - dimensional ( 3d ) .",
    "this is confirmed by resistivity measurements , which show a @xmath10 non fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior at the critical pressure , as expected for 3d fluctuations in spin - fluctuation theories @xcite .",
    "recently , a new family of hf compounds was discovered @xcite , ce@xmath11t@xmath12in@xmath13 , which is composed of alternating layers of cein@xmath0 and tin@xmath14 stacked along the c - direction with t = ir , rh , or co. their main interest arises from the layered structure that is thought to induce 2d fluctuations that would enhance the superconductivity more than 3d fluctuations near @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "indeed , cecoin@xmath15 has a superconducting state at ambient pressure below @xmath8 = 2.3 k , the highest @xmath8 observed up to now in hf systems @xcite .",
    "these recent results motivated us to reinvestigate the common brick of these quasi 2d compounds : the 3d heavy fermion cein@xmath0 .    previous inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) studies on powder samples of cein@xmath0 @xcite showed the existence of a crystal field ( cf ) excitation at @xmath16 12 mev with a large broadening ascribed to the kondo effect . in this work ,",
    "we present new ins measurements on single crystals , which due to new flux growing methods are now sufficiently large for such studies .",
    "these measurements show the existence of well - defined spin - wave excitations in the magnetically ordered phase , which coexist with quasielastic ( qe ) kondo - type spin - fluctuations and the previously observed broadened crystal - field excitations .",
    "the single crystals used in this study were grown by the self flux method @xcite . a first set of neutron scattering measurements was carried out on the time - of - flight chopper spectrometer mari at isis , using incident energies of 22 and 60.3 mev .",
    "the corresponding energy resolution was approximately 2 and 5 mev , respectively . because of the strong neutron absorption cross - section of in",
    ", the single crystals were cut to a thickness of 2 mm and used in transmission geometry .",
    "a total of 30 crystals with total weight of 13 g were aligned and glued to a thin aluminium plate , which was mounted in a closed - cycle refrigerator .",
    "the mosaicity of the assembly was approximately 6@xmath17 .",
    "measurements were performed in the ( hhl ) plane , with an angle between the incident wavevector and the [ 001 ] direction of 2.5 and 30@xmath17 .",
    "a second set of neutron scattering measurements was made on the triple - axis spectrometer in22 at the ill ( grenoble , france ) .",
    "pyrolytic graphite was used for the vertically focusing monochromator and the horizontally focusing analyzer .",
    "a pg filter in the scattered beam was used to suppress higher order contamination , and final neutron energies of 8.05 and 14.7 mev were used , giving an energy resolution of 0.5 and 1.0 mev , respectively .",
    "two thin plates of the assembly used on mari were aligned on an aluminum support and mounted in a helium flow `` orange '' cryostat .",
    "the total mass of the sample was about 1 g and the mosaicity 0.5@xmath17 .",
    "the ( hhl ) scattering plane was investigated .",
    "for the two crystals orientations used on mari and at temperatures of @xmath3 = 5 , 15 and 150 k , we recorded @xmath18 intensity maps for 0@xmath1910 @xmath20 and @xmath21 mev , where * q * is the wavevector transfer and @xmath22 is the energy transfer . despite strong phonon contamination from both the cein@xmath0 sample and the al support , we observed an excitation around 12 mev which was independent of the crystal orientation and whose intensity decreased with @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the 12 mev excitation obtained for @xmath24 @xmath20 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the excitation shows only a very slight softening and broadening as the temperature goes from the ordered state at @xmath25 k to the paramagnetic state at @xmath26 k. at much higher temperatures , @xmath3 = 150 k , the excitation is partly suppressed .",
    "figure 2 shows the wavevector dependence of the excitation spectrum at @xmath25 k. the peak at 12 mev observed at low @xmath23 ( integration over @xmath27 @xmath20 ) disappears at higher wave vectors ( integration over @xmath28 @xmath20 ) , reflecting its magnetic nature .",
    "the contribution around 20 mev , seen only at high @xmath23 s , is due to phonons .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath3 dependence of the 12 mev excitation , as illustrated in figs . 1 and 2",
    ", clearly show its magnetic origin , and corresponds to the cf excitation observed in powder samples by lawrence et al .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the cubic environment of ce@xmath29 in cein@xmath0 can be treated in terms of stevens operators by the following cf hamiltonian : @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian splits the @xmath31 spin - orbit level of ce@xmath29 into a @xmath32 quartet and a @xmath33 doublet . in the case of cein@xmath0",
    ", susceptibility measurements indicates that @xmath34 @xcite , implying that the ground state is @xmath33 .",
    "this has been confirmed by polarized neutron scattering measurements , which also reveals an admixture of @xmath32 to the ground state @xmath33 in the ordered phase @xcite .",
    "the excitation observed here at 12 mev corresponds then to the @xmath35 excitation .",
    "in addition to the 12 mev cf excitation , it is clear from the data that there is an additional quasielastic ( qe ) component to the scattering .",
    "the low-@xmath23 data at @xmath25 k were therefore analyzed using three components : an incoherent elastic peak , a quasielastic spin - fluctuation contribution , and a crystal - field excitation . since the different contributions partly overlap , we fixed the width ( half width at half maximum , hwhm ) @xmath36 of the qe contribution to @xmath37 = 0.86 mev where @xmath38 = 10 k is the kondo temperature .",
    "the results of the analysis at @xmath3 = 5 k give a crystal - field splitting of @xmath39 mev and a broadening of the cf levels ( hwhm ) of @xmath40 mev .",
    "no significant difference in the values of the cf excitations were found for the different orientations of the crystal . at @xmath26",
    "k , the resulting cf splitting is @xmath41 mev and its width is @xmath42 mev .",
    "the slight softening observed of @xmath43 is related to the splitting of the cf levels below @xmath5 .",
    "the dispersive mode that appears below @xmath5 was first observed using the mari chopper spectrometer .",
    "because of the 3d character of this mode , the study of its dispersion was continued using the in22 triple - axis spectrometer .",
    "energy scans up to 6 mev energy transfer were measured for different values of the wavevector transfer @xmath44 .",
    "figure 3 shows spectra of cein@xmath0 at @xmath45 for @xmath46 and 15 k. this corresponds to the reduced wavevector @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a reciprocal lattice vector and @xmath49 is a magnetic propagation vector ( wavevectors are expressed in reciprocal lattice unit with 1 r.l.u .",
    "= 2 @xmath50 , where @xmath51   is the lattice parameter ) .",
    "figure 3 clearly shows that the excitation present at @xmath52 disappears for @xmath53 . for each wavevector @xmath54 ,",
    "the excitation was fitted by a gaussian whose width corresponds to the instrumental resolution .",
    "the strong dispersion of this excitation in the three main directions of the crystal is shown in figure 4 .",
    "since the direction of the ordered moment in cein@xmath55 is unknown and our sample is in a multidomain state , it is not possible to determine the polarization of the excitation ; it will be assumed to be transverse as for a conventional spin wave .    supposing that the cf energy is of the same order as the exchange interaction , it seems appropriate to treat the spin wave using the so - called molecular - field random - phase approximation @xcite . writing the exchange hamiltonian as @xmath56 gives the general dispersion relation @xmath57 [ \\delta - m^{2}i(\\textbf{q+k})]\\}^{1/2 } , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the propagation vector of the ordered state , @xmath59 the fourier transform of the exchange interaction @xmath60 , and @xmath61 the splitting of the @xmath33 doublet into @xmath62 and @xmath63 due to the molecular and anisotropy fields",
    "the transition matrix element between the ground state @xmath62 and the first excited state @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 ( @xmath65 + or - ) .",
    "considering only the nearest neighbor exchange @xmath66 [ along ( 1,0,0 ) ] and the next nearest neighbor exchange @xmath67 [ along ( 1,1,0 ) ] , the exchange interaction is @xmath68\\nonumber \\\\ & + & 2i_{2}[cos(2\\pi ( q_{x}-q_{y}))+cos(2\\pi ( q_{y}-q_{z}))+cos(2\\pi(q_{z}-q_{x } ) ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\:\\,+ cos(2\\pi ( q_{x}+q_{y}))+cos(2\\pi ( q_{y}+q_{z}))+cos(2\\pi(q_{z}+q_{x}))].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a two sub - lattice picture constituted of alternating ( 1,1,1 ) planes where the spins are up or down , @xmath66 would correspond to the antiferromagnetic exchange between spins from different sublattices and @xmath67 would correspond to the ferromagnetic exchange between spins from the same sublattice .",
    "a global fit to the dispersion curves of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is shown in figure 4 .",
    "it gives the exchange terms @xmath69 mev and @xmath70 mev and the @xmath33 splitting @xmath71 mev .",
    "the corresponding spin - wave gap is : @xmath72 1.28 mev .",
    "the exchange energy can be expressed by @xmath73 .",
    "taking the wave functions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 when there is neither exchange nor distortion @xcite gives us an approximated square transition matrix element @xmath74 = 2.78 thus @xmath75 mev . with @xmath76",
    ", we obtain @xmath77 mev .",
    "the ratio @xmath78 permits then to conclude that the cf energy is of the same order than the exchange interaction that justifies the treatment of the spin wave using the molecular - field random - phase approximation .",
    "we have analyzed the q - independent excitations using two contributions , one corresponding to quasielastic scattering and the other to a crystal - field transition .",
    "since these excitations overlap with each other and with the incoherent peak ( see figure 2 ) , the energy , width , and weight of the different contributions extracted from the data depend on the model used for the fitting .",
    "this is illustrated by the scatter in the estimates of @xmath43 , @xmath79 , and @xmath36 found in the literature @xcite . at low temperatures , the qe excitation corresponds to the spin fluctuations of the @xmath33 electronic level , which are attributed to the kondo effect .",
    "its width ( hwhm ) @xmath36 corresponds to the kondo temperature .",
    "a kondo temperature of @xmath38 = 10 k at a pressure of @xmath80 = 19 kbar was obtained in @xmath81in - nqr measurements by kawasaki et al .",
    "it is likely that below this pressure the anomaly at @xmath5 in the @xmath82 temperature variation masks the @xmath38 anomaly .",
    "we assume therefore that @xmath38 has a very slight variation for pressures below @xmath80 = 19 kbar , so that it is only slightly smaller than 10 k at ambient pressure .",
    "resistivity measurements give a kondo scattering maximum at @xmath83 50 k @xcite , which corresponds to the high kondo temperature @xmath84{t_{k}(\\delta_{cf}/k_{b})^{2}}$ ] @xcite .",
    "ins gives @xmath85 10.6 mev which with @xmath86 50 k leads to @xmath87 8 k. it is then reasonable to approximate the kondo temperature by @xmath87 10 k in cein@xmath0 at ambient pressure . for the ins measurement carried out at @xmath88 5 k @xmath89",
    ", we choose consequently to fix the qe width to @xmath90 0.86mev .",
    "the fact that @xmath91 5.7 mev is relatively large compared to @xmath92 0.86 mev is due to the larger spin fluctuations associated with the @xmath32 first excited level .",
    "in fact , the cf transition @xmath35 has a width corresponding to the convolution of the @xmath33 and @xmath32 widths @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we can approximate @xmath95 and thus estimate that @xmath96 4.84 mev , which is effectively 5 times larger than @xmath36 .",
    "even if the cf level is broad , it seems that the propagating spin waves can be described by considering @xmath33 as an `` isolated '' doublet split by the anisotropy and exchange fields .",
    "since this doublet originates from a sixfold degenerate @xmath76 level , an anisotropy gap is expected in the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "we recall that in the isotropic case , the spin - wave dispersion has no gap , since only the exchange is responsible for the splitting @xmath61 .",
    "the gap @xmath97 of the spin wave excitation corresponds to its minimum energy that is obtained at @xmath98 . since this excitation overlaps with the incoherent elastic scattering that reflects the experimental resolution and with the quasielastic contribution of the spin fluctuations ,",
    "the gap was not correctly obtained in the present neutron experiment .",
    "the given value of @xmath97 corresponds to the best fit to the data using the spin - wave model described above .",
    "an attempt to directly observe the gap using a smaller incident energy ( and hence better resolution ) on the cold triple - axis spectrometer in12 ( ill ) failed because of the strong indium absorption cross - section .",
    "a determination of the energy gap was also made by low - temperature specific - heat measurements which exhibited a spin wave contribution that leads to a gap @xmath99 mev @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the gap energy of 1.28 mev deduced from our ins measurements is somewhat overestimated .",
    "the result of our spin - wave analysis is in good agreement with calculations made by wang et al . for ce@xmath29 ions under cubic crystal field and effective exchange field @xcite .",
    "they consider a molecular field along the c - axis , which can be approximated by @xmath100 , and calculate the level splitting as a function of @xmath101 . knowing that for cein@xmath0 @xmath5 = 10.1 k , @xmath102 mev and hence @xmath103 mev ( @xmath104 ) , we have @xmath105mev @xmath106 . for this value of @xmath101 , wang et al .",
    "calculate a @xmath33 splitting of about @xmath107 mev .",
    "although we suppose that in our case the molecular field is not along the c - axis ( see below ) , we believe that wang s calculations give the right order of the splitting @xmath61 .",
    "there are several indications for that the moments are not along the c - axis .",
    "if the cf alone imposes the easy magnetization axis , the positive sign of @xmath108 in the cf hamiltonian implies that the moments are along the [ 1,1,1 ] direction in the ordered phase .",
    "this is also supported by nuclear quadrupolar resonance measurements @xcite .",
    "although it is difficult to determine the moment direction of a cubic compound by neutron diffraction , some recent measurements also suggest that the moments are not along the c - axis @xcite .",
    "cein@xmath0 seems to have a behavior very similar to the hf compound cepd@xmath14si@xmath14 which is antiferromagnetically ordered at ambient pressure and has the same kind of excitation spectrum with coexisting qe , cf , and spin - wave excitations @xcite .",
    "the characteristic energies are very close and , moreover , unconventional superconductivity appears at a similar external pressure @xcite .",
    "a summary of the characteristic physical quantities of those two compounds is given in table 1 .",
    "a focus on the few differences between those two compounds can be made as following .",
    "firstly cepd@xmath14si@xmath14 is tetragonal while cein@xmath0 is cubic .",
    "some characteristics such as the cf splitting or the susceptibility anisotropy can be directly linked to anisotropy effects that are resulting from those lattice structures . then , the characteristic quantities @xmath8 and @xmath109 are twice bigger in cepd@xmath14si@xmath14 than in cein@xmath0 , that could traduce an enhancement of the spin fluctuations in the tetragonal cepd@xmath14si@xmath14 . as a supplement to the studies of quasi 2d ce@xmath11t@xmath12in@xmath13 compounds where @xmath8 can reach more than 2 k ,",
    "an alternative way to study the influence of anisotropy in strongly correlated systems could consequently remain in a detailed comparison between cubic cein@xmath0 and tetragonal cepd@xmath14si@xmath14 .",
    ".characteristic physical quantities of cein@xmath0 and cepd@xmath14si@xmath14 .",

    "we have performed the first inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals of cein@xmath0 . the combined use of time - of - flight and triple - axis spectrometers allowed us to study both local and dispersive low - energy excitations .",
    "we found the coexistence below @xmath5 of a spin - wave with a quasielastic component and a crystal - field excitation .",
    "the cf levels are substantially broadened by kondo - type spin fluctuations , which indicates the proximity to an intermediate valence state where the cf collapse . despite the smearing of the cf levels ,",
    "the observation of spin waves means that the ground state level in cein@xmath0 is also relatively well - defined .",
    "the challenge is then to understand how these excitations evolve on going toward a qcp where the hierarchy between the kondo effect and the rkky coupling is reversed while the cf should be close to a collapse .",
