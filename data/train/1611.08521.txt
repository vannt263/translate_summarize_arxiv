    "the direct numerical simulations , which have obtained important results in the last decades , largely dominate the actual research in turbulence .",
    "the analytical advance based on first principle description and mathematically justifiable approximations is comparatively very small .",
    "one cause , perhaps the principal one , is the stochastic advection process , which appears in all turbulent systems . in realistic descriptions of turbulence",
    "the advected field are active in the sense that they influence the velocity fields .",
    "but , even the most simplified models that deal with passive fields have not been solved analytically in all cases .",
    "the cause is the basic problem of particle trajectories in stochastic velocity fields , which can be rather complex in important special cases .",
    "one example is the turbulence in incompressible media that is dominantly two dimensional .",
    "the two - dimensional turbulence has a self - organizing character @xcite-@xcite that consists of the generation of quasi - coherent structure ( vortices ) , which can increase up to the size of the system in special cases as the decaying turbulence in ideal fluids .",
    "the tendency to self - organization is partly maintained is weakly perturbed systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this property appear at the basic level of particle ( tracer ) trajectories .",
    "they are random sequences of trapping or eddying events and long jumps .",
    "the trapping process @xcite-@xcite strongly modifies the diffusion coefficients and leads to non - gaussian distribution of displacements .",
    "theoretical methods for determining the statistics of the advected particles were developed in the last decades and used for the study of various aspects of the transport . the decorrelation trajectory method ( dtm , @xcite ) and",
    "the nested subensemble approach ( nsa , @xcite ) are the first semi - analytical methods that are able to go beyond the quasi - linear regime that corresponds to quasi - gaussian transport .",
    "they were specifically developed for the case of two - dimensional incompressible turbulence that is characterized by trajectory trapping or eddying .",
    "the general conclusion of these studies is that the existence of space correlations of the stochastic velocity can generate trajectory trapping or eddying , which leads to nonstandard statistics of trajectories : non - gaussian distributions , long time lagrangian correlations ( memory ) , strongly modified transport coefficients and an increased degree of coherence .",
    "the trapped trajectories form quasi - coherent structures similar to fluid vortices .",
    "very recent results @xcite have shown that these methods could be the basis for the development of a theoretical approach for the study of test modes in turbulent plasmas .",
    "it is similar to the lagrangian approach initiated by dupree @xcite , @xcite and developed in the 70s .",
    "the assumption of random trajectories with gaussian distribution limited the application of dupree s method to the quasilinear regime .",
    "the dtm and nsa enable the evaluation of the average propagator of the test modes in the nonlinear regime and extend the theoretical procedure to the complex processes that are generated in these conditions .",
    "the tendency of drift turbulence evolution beyond the quasilinear regime was obtained .",
    "we present a theoretical approach to the study of turbulence evolution , the iterated self - consistent method ( isc ) .",
    "it is based on the analysis of the test particles and test modes in turbulent plasmas .",
    "both test particle and test mode studies start from given statistical description of the turbulence .",
    "however , the coupling of these problems can lead to the evaluation of turbulence evolution and to the understanding of the nonlinear processes that are generated .",
    "the isc is applied here to the drift turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the physical processes analyzed in this paper and the main ideas that are followed in this study are presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains the test particle studies of transport , the dtm and the nsa . a discussion on the representation of the complex trajectories by these methods is also included .",
    "the two modules of the isc ( test particle and test mode studies ) for the case of drift turbulence are presented in section 4 .",
    "the isc is discussed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains the results on the evolution of drift turbulence and the analysis of the nonlinear processes that appear in different conditions ( weak and strong drive of the instability ) .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 7 .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that particle trajectories in two - dimensional incompressible stochastic velocity fields are characterized by a mixture of random and quasi - coherent aspects , which appear as a random sequence of large jumps and trapping or eddying events .",
    "they are solutions of the equation@xmath0where @xmath1 is the trajectory in rectangular coordinates @xmath2 @xmath3  @xmath4  @xmath5  and @xmath6  is the potential .  this is a hamiltonian system with the conjugate variables represented by the two components of particle trajectories .",
    "the origin of eddying is the hamiltonian structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the trajectories are periodic and they wind on the contour lines of the potential when it is time independent .",
    "this defines the state of permanent trapping .",
    "the lagrangian potential is invariant in these conditions and the transport is subdiffusive because the particles are tied on the fixed contour lines of the potential .    if the motion is weakly perturbed ( by time variation of the potential or by other components of the motion that can by introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) , the trapping is temporary and alternates with large jumps .",
    "the statistical importance of the trapping events depends on the strength of the perturbation that is represented by dimensionless factors , which are usually ratios of characteristic times .",
    "two characteristic times are defined in ( eq1 ) : the correlation time of the potential @xmath7 that gives the scale of the time variation of @xmath6 and the time of flight of the particles @xmath8 where @xmath9  is the space scale of @xmath6  and @xmath10 is the amplitude of the velocity .",
    "these parameters appear in the eulerian correlation of the potential defined in section 3 .",
    "the characteristic times define the kubo number @xmath11  which is a measure of trapping in time dependent potentials .",
    "namely , the permanent trapping corresponds to @xmath12  temporary trapping exists for @xmath13 and the statistical relevance of trapping is a decreasing function of @xmath14 any other perturbation of the basic hamiltonian motion  defines a characteristic time @xmath15 for the decorrelation of the trajectory from the potential , and a dimensionless parameter similar to kubo number , the decorrelation number @xmath16     the trapping events appear when the trajectory arrives around the maxima and the minima of the potential . the process is quasi - coherent because it affects all the particles situated in these regions in the same way .",
    "the high degree of coherence of the trapped trajectories is evidenced in a study of the statistical properties of the distance @xmath17 between neighbour trajectories @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath18 is very slow , which shows that neighbour particles have a coherent motion for a long time compared to @xmath19 they are characterized by a strong clump effect with the increase of @xmath20 that is slower than the richardson law .",
    "these trajectories form intermittent quasi - coherent structures similar to fluid vortices and represent eddying regions .",
    "their average size and life - time depend on the characteristic of the turbulence .",
    "the trapping events appear around the maxima and the minima of the potential .",
    "the other particles ( that evolve on contour lines corresponding to small absolute values of the potential ) have much larger displacements .",
    "the large displacements are caused by the large size of these contour lines and also by the decorrelation , which allows transitions between neighbour potential cells .",
    "these large jumps are random . the transport is essentially determined by them , while the trapping events have negligible contributions .",
    "thus , trapping can be associated to a process of micro - confinement . at a given moment",
    ", the micro - confinement affects a fraction of the particle , and , in a large time interval , every particle is subjected to micro - confinement events during a fraction of this time .",
    "the micro - confinement determines the existence of transport reservoirs in the sense that diffusion can be strongly enhanced when these trapped particles are released by the increase of the perturbation strength .",
    "the quasi - coherent trajectory structures have more complex effects in the presence of an average velocity @xmath21 the probability of the lagrangian velocity has to be time invariant , as required by the zero divergence of the velocity field . in particular , the average lagrangian velocity @xmath22 has to be equal to the average eulerian velocity at any time .",
    "the trapped particles do not contribute to @xmath23 which means that the free particles have an average velocity larger than @xmath24 in order to compensate the fraction of trapped particles @xmath25 this effect leads , in the case of a potential that drifts with the velocity @xmath26 to flows in both directions : the structures move with the potential with the velocity @xmath24 and the freeparticles have an average motion in the opposite direction with a velocity @xmath27 such that   @xmath28the average velocity also determines the release of a part of the trapped particles and the decrease of the size of the trajectory structures . at large @xmath24 ,",
    "the structures are completely eliminated at    the aim of the paper is to analyze the effects produced by these complex trajectories on the evolution of drift turbulence and on the associated transport .",
    "we show that the physical picture of the trajectories that mix random and quasi - coherent aspects is well represented in the dtm and nsa .",
    "the problem of test particle transport and typical results obtained with these methods are presented in section 3 .",
    "the image of the random and quasi - coherent aspects given by the dtm and nsa is emphasized and the effects of the micro - confinement are discussed in this section .    the drift turbulence is analyzed in relation with the random and quasi - coherent aspects of the trajectories ( sections 4 and 6 ) .",
    "this type of turbulence determines special effects on transport coefficients , which are presented in section 4.2 , together with the characteristics of the trajectory structures and their influence on the probability of displacements .",
    "the test modes on turbulent plasma are presented in section 4.1 .",
    "it is shown that the trajectory structures can lead to strong nonlinear effects .",
    "the self - consistent evolution of the drift turbulence obtained with the isc is finally analyzed in section 6 .",
    "the eulerian and the lagragian correlations are the main concepts in test particle transport . the two point eulerian correlation ( ec ) of the velocity is defined as@xmath29where @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 account for the two components of the velocity .",
    "the main statistical parameters of the velocity field appear in this function .",
    "the amplitudes of velocity fluctuation are @xmath33 the correlation lengths @xmath34  are the characteristic decay lengths of the functions @xmath35 and the correlation time is defined by the time decay of @xmath36 we consider here homogeneous and stationary velocity fields , which have ecs that depend only on the distance between the two points and on the difference between the two times , as ( ecdef ) .",
    "the ec describes the space structure and the time variation of the stochastic velocity field    the lagrangian velocity correlation ( lvc ) is defined as@xmath37where @xmath38  is the trajectory in a realization of the stochastic field that starts at @xmath39 in the point @xmath40 .",
    "the lvc is thus a time dependent function that describes statistical properties of particle motion in the stochastic velocity field . in most cases the lvc decays to zero since the lagrangian velocity becomes statistically independent on the initial velocity ( it decorrelates ) .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath15  of the lvc decay is the measure of the memory of the stochastic lagragian velocity .",
    "the decorrelation time @xmath41 is the correlation time @xmath7  of the ec if particle motion is determined only by the  velocity field , and it can be completely different of @xmath7 in the presence of additional components of the motion ( average velocity , collisional diffusivity , etc . )    besides this important effect of memory , the lvc determines the main quantities related to test particle transport . as shown by taylor taylor ,",
    "the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xmath42 and its derivative , the running diffusion coefficient @xmath43 , are integrals of the lvc@xmath44@xmath45  the asymptotic values of @xmath43   @xmath46are the diffusion coefficients . the time dependent diffusion coefficients provide  the `` microscopic '' characteristics of the transport process .",
    "the diffusion at the transport space - time scales , which are much larger than @xmath47 and @xmath48 is described by the asymptotic values @xmath49    the aim of the test particle studies is essentially to determine the lvc as function of the ec .",
    "the decorrelation of the lagrangian velocity after the memory time @xmath50  leads to the possibility of decomposing the statistics of the displacements at large time @xmath51  in a sequence of independent small scale processes of time @xmath52  the probability of the small scale displacements ( the micro - probability ) , @xmath53 determines the elementary step of the transport process as the msd@xmath54the statistics of the displacements at large times @xmath51 is gaussian , with the exception of the processes that have @xmath55  or @xmath56  ( see  @xcite , bcarte ) .",
    "the asymptotic diffusion coefficients are usually approximated by a random walk with the step @xmath57  performed in the time @xmath48  that is @xmath58    it is important to underline that the test particle transport gives results that are in very good agreement to those obtained from turbulent fluxes when the space scale of the turbulence is much smaller than the characteristic lengths of the gradients .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical simulations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical methods are essentially based on corrsin hypothesis @xcite , which assume that the micro - probability @xmath59 is gaussian and that the displacements are statistically independent on the velocity field .",
    "they lead to diffusive transport in the limit of static velocity fields ( @xmath60 and thus they can not apply to the special case of zero divergence two - dimensional velocity fields .",
    "it can be shown that a diffusive transport is obtained even when the second assumption is eliminated , which suggest that the micro - probability is not gaussian in the presence of trapping .",
    "the first theoretical approach that finds subdiffusive transport in this special case ( @xcite , @xcite ) does not use the gaussian assumption , but it is based on the percolation theory .",
    "it only determines the scaling of the asymptotic diffusion coefficients .",
    "the detailed statistical information that is contained in the lvc ( [ lcdef ] ) was first obtained by the decorrelation trajectory method ( dtm , @xcite ) .",
    "this semi - analytical method was developed and validated by the nested subensemble approach ( nsa , @xcite ) .",
    "a short review of the dtm and nsa and a discussion of the image they give on the micro - confinement process is presented below .      trajectory trapping or eddying is a consequence of the lagrangian invariance of the potential .",
    "the dtm and the nsa were developed having in mind the necessity of evidencing the statistical consequences of this invariance .",
    "we have also imposed the condition of performing only the approximations that do not violate this property .",
    "the main idea is to define subensembles of the realizations of the potential that correspond to the same values of the potential and of its derivatives in the starting point of the trajectories @xmath61 @xmath62  a system of nested subensembles is constructed .",
    "all the realization with the potential @xmath63 are grouped together in a subensemble @xmath64 then @xmath65 is subdivided  into subensembles @xmath66according to the values of the first space derivatives of the potential @xmath67 , then each @xmath66  is again divided  into smaller subensembles @xmath68  using the values of the second derivatives @xmath69 , and the procedure can continue .",

    "the subensemble average @xmath75 exists even in the case of zero average velocities .",

    "the subensemble dispersion @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 ) is much smaller that the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations in the whole set of realization @xmath81 .",
    "it is zero for @xmath82 and @xmath83  ( because imposing a condition on the value of the velocity eliminates any fluctuation ) , and it reaches the value @xmath81 at distances larger than the correlation lengths @xmath34 and/or at times larger than the correlation time @xmath7 .",
    "the small amplitude of the velocity fluctuations in the subensemble @xmath70 provides a second contribution to the increase of the degree of similarity of the set of trajectories that yield from the realizations that are included in @xmath84    the subensemble average velocity @xmath76 has the same structure as particle velocity .",
    "it can be derived from a function @xmath85 which is the subensemble average potential@xmath86the potential @xmath87 is obtained as the conditional average with the set of conditions that define the nested subensembles .",

    "the characteristics of the ec , @xmath34  and @xmath367 also saturate ( figure 6b ) .",
    "the condition for the existence of trajectory structures is no more fulfilled ( @xmath256 is significantly smaller than @xmath368 .",
    "however , trapping becomes much stronger ( @xmath217 and the size of the structures increase , as seen in figure 6c ) .",
    "this rather nontrivial evolution of the drift turbulence can be understood by analyzing the nonlinear effects that influence the growth rate ( gamnl ) : the ion diffusion , the formation of ion trajectory structures and flows .",

    ", height=188 ]    the evolution of the diffusion coefficients @xmath154 is presented in figure 7 , where the amplitudes of the drift turbulence @xmath370 and of the zonal flow potential @xmath371  are also shown .",
    "one can see that the zonal flow modes become unstable when trapping appears and they grow exponentially until @xmath372 their amplitude is negligible compared to that of the drift turbulence during this time interval .",
    "thus , it is not expected an important role of the zonal flow modes at this stage .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath270 is much larger than @xmath271 it has a very large increase rate during the first transition into the nonlinear regime .",
    "the cause is ion trapping in the potential that drifts with the diamagnetic velocity , which determines a strong amplification of the diffusion along @xmath373 as discusses in section 4.2 and represented in figure 3 .",
    "the strong diffusion determines the transitory decay of the potential @xmath374 under the nonlinearity limit .",
    "consequently , the structures of the ion trajectories are destroyed . the fraction of trapped trajectories and the size of the structures decrease when @xmath375 decreases ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath270 decreases due to both effects ( the decrease of @xmath151 and the reduction of structures ) .",
    "one can see in figures 7 and 6c that transitory peaks and decays appear around @xmath376 for @xmath377 @xmath210 @xmath217  and @xmath305 .",
    "after that , the potential increases again and reaches a higher level in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the diffusion coefficients @xmath270 recovers large values , but without driving the decay process .",
    "the strong diffusion is supported by the potential , which increases at this stage instead of having a fast decay as in the previous event .",
    "the cause of the different behahiour is the evolution of the parameters of the spectrum .",
    "the dominant wave number @xmath378  ( maxima of the spectrum ) and the width of the spectrum @xmath379 decrease as seen in figure 6b . as a consequence ,",
    "the damping effect of the diffusion @xmath380  is weaker at small wave numbers and the growth rate of the modes remains positive .",
    "the third time interval in the evolution is characterized by the presence of the zonal flow modes at amplitudes comparable to @xmath149  the drift turbulence decays and saturates while the zonal flow amplitude increases .",
    "the ec of the drift potential also saturates ( @xmath34  and @xmath336  are roughly constant during this interval ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath335 shown in figure 6a is determined by the growing contribution of the zonal flow modes .",
    "zonal flow provide the explanation for the increase of trapping ( figure 6c ) that seems paradoxical in the condition of the decay of @xmath381 below the nonlinearity limit .",
    "the structure of the potential contour lines is modified by the zonal flow potential , which determines larger structures that capture the ions which are not micro - confined by the drift turbulence .",
    "the fraction of trapped ions and the size of the structures increase in correlation with the increase of @xmath382 ( figures 6c and 7 ) .",
    "a deformation of the trajectory structures appears due to the stronger increase of @xmath383  that of @xmath384  they are initially elongated in the gradient direction and eventually they acquire a shape dominated by the zonal flow modes .",
    "the fraction of trapped ions strongly increases and , at @xmath385 it overcomes the value @xmath386 ( @xmath387 that corresponds to negative growth rate of the drift modes ( [ gamnl ] ) even in the absence of diffusion .    the diffusion coefficients decrease in this stage due to the decay of the potential @xmath149 the increase of the diffusion @xmath270 determined by the zonal flow contribution discussed in @xcite",
    "is not observed here because the negative growth rate effect leads to the transition in the quasilinear regime and the condition ( @xmath388 ) for this effect is not fulfilled .",
    "the decay of the drift turbulence is caused by the zonal flow modes through the amplification of trapping rather than by an increased diffusion .",
    "the evolution of the spectrum of the drift turbulence is presented in figure 8a , which shows the function @xmath389 at time intervals @xmath390the spectrum becomes narrower as time increases and its maxima move to smaller values of @xmath391     the eulerian correlation of the potential is shown in figure 8b . the oscillatory dependence on @xmath392 is determined by the narrow peaks of the spectrum .",
    "it determines the small diffusion along the density gradient @xmath393  despite the amplitude of the stochastic velocity that is much larger in this direction ( @xmath394     the spectrum of the zonal flow modes @xmath395 is shown in figure 8c at the same time moments as @xmath396  the two spectra have similar shapes , with the difference that the zonal flow modes have small tails at large @xmath397 while a very strong cut appears for the drift modes at large @xmath398 .",
    "this is the consequence of the diffusive damping that is weak in the case of the zonal flow modes , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ gamzf ] ) .",
    "the dominant wave number of the zonal flow modes is around @xmath399 and it has a weak decrease with time ( as also seen in figure 6b , black curve ) .",
    "particle trajectories in 2-dimensional incompressible velocity fields can include both random and coherent aspects , which appear as random sequences of large jumps and trapping or eddying events .",
    "this complex behaviour is determined by the hamiltonian structure of the equation of motion , and it effectively appears when the stochastic potential is only weakly perturbed .",
    "the trapped trajectories have a high degree of coherence and they form intermittent quasi - coherent trajectory structures .",
    "their size and life - time depend on the characteristic of the turbulence .",
    "the distribution of the displacements is non - gaussian in the presence of these vortical structures .",
    "we have developed semi - analytical statistical methods for the study of such complex trajectories , the dtm @xcite and the nsa @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these methods provide very clear physical images on the nonlinear transport processes and reasonably good quantitative results .",
    "the quasi - coherent structures , which actually produce a process of micro - confinement , have strong effects on the transport .",
    "the transport is determined by the long jumps , while the structures represent a diffusion reservoir , which leads to significant increase of the diffusion coefficients when the particles are released by a decorrelation mechanism .",
    "the transport process is completely different in the presence of structures in the sense that the dependence on the parameters is different .",
    "the quasi - coherent structures have strong effect on the test modes on turbulent plasmas .",
    "this conclusion is drawn from an analytical study of the drift turbulence that includes the coherent aspects of the trajectories beside the random ones @xcite .",
    "the frequencies and the growth rates of the test modes on strongly turbulent plasmas could be determined by the renormalized propagator procedure .",
    "a different perspective on important aspects of the physics of drift type turbulence in the strongly nonlinear regime is deduced .",
    "the main role in the nonlinear processes is shown to be played by the ion trajectory structures .",
    "the nonlinear damping of drift modes and the generation of zonal flow modes appear when trapping is strong due to the ion flows generated by the drift of the potential with the diamagnetic velocity .",
    "the conclusion drawn from this test mode study is that there is no causality relation between these processes , although there is time correlation between them .",
    "the predator - prey paradigm is not sustained by these results .",
    "these test particle and test mode studies determine the transport coefficients and the characteristics of the test modes for given statistical description of the turbulence , as functions of turbulence parameters .",
    "the conclusions on turbulence and transport evolution base on the analysis of these results are speculative , because they only suppose that the positive growth rates of the test modes eventually drive the turbulence in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we show here that test particle and test mode studies can be connected in an iterated self - consistent ( isc ) theoretical description of turbulence evolution .",
    "it is an approximate lagrangian method that takes into account the quasi - coherent aspects of particle trajectories in turbulence .",
    "a computer code based on the isc was developed for the drift turbulence in uniform magnetic field .",
    "the advantage of this approach is the clear physical image that can be deduced for complicated nonlinear processes .",
    "they are related to the basic problem of particle advection in turbulence .      in the case of weak drive of the drift turbulence ,",
    "the evolution is determined by the nonlinear effects of the ion diffusion .",
    "they consist not only of the diffusive damping that reduces the growth rate of the modes , but also of the modification of the spectrum .",
    "the dominant wave number decreases and the correlation length increase .",
    "in particular the increase of @xmath400 leads to values that are larger than those of the normalized potential @xmath256 during the evolution , which shows that trajectory trapping is negligible .",
    "the ion trajectories are random in this case , with negligible structures .    in the case of strong drive , both random and the quasi - coherent characteristics of the trajectories are generated during the evolution .",
    "the structures of trajectories influence the evolution of the drift turbulence by three mechanisms .",
    "all of them are connected to the quasi - coherent trajectory structures .",
    "one in the dependence of the growth rates of the test modes ( [ gamnl ] ) on the parameters of the structures ( the fraction of trapped trajectories @xmath401 and the size of the structures ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath401 and of @xmath305  determine the decrease of  @xmath402  which become negative for all wave numbers at @xmath403  even for @xmath404  the increase of the structures determines the generation of the zonal flow modes ( as @xmath405  ( [ gamzf ] ) ) , which represent the second possible influence on the drift turbulence .",
    "they action is indirect and consists of the modification of the diffusion and/or of the structures .",
    "the third mechanism is provided by the diffusion , which can be strongly changed by the structures .",
    "the results presented in the figures 6 - 8 show a strong action of the third mechanism at the beginning of the nonlinear stage , around @xmath406 trajectory trapping determines a strong increase of the diffusion coefficient @xmath377 which drives the turbulence back in the quasilinear regime .",
    "the process last for a short time interval , and it is eliminated by the decrease of the wave numbers of the drift turbulence , which reduces strongly the diffusive damping in the growth rate ( [ gamnl ] ) .",
    "the decrease of the wave numbers is due to the narrowing of the spectrum as the effect of increased diffusion .",
    "thus , a complex transient process of interaction appears at this stage , which is the result of increased diffusion which determines both the increase and the decrease of the diffusive damping .",
    "the other two mechanisms determine the evolution at later time when the zonal flow modes reach amplitudes that are comparable to @xmath149 the zonal flow modes determine the increase of the structures due the the modification of the potential .",
    "the fraction of trapped trajectories increases , the structure have larger size and they become elongated in the direction of the zona flow modes .",
    "this leads to the decay of the drift turbulence which acquire negative growth rates .",
    "the zonal flow effect is produced through the quasi - coherent structures , rather than through the diffusion in the system studied here .    in conclusion ,",
    "the results obtained in this paper bring a new image on nonlinear processes associated to the generation of quasi - coherence in particle trajectories .",
    "they apply to the drift turbulence in a simple confinement geometry ( uniform magnetic field ) , but we expect that similar processes can be found in more realistic models of turbulence",
