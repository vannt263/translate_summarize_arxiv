    "the similarity of metallicity and age between m5 and ngc 6229 has been noted in the past ( borissova et al .",

    "however , when it comes to the instability strip ( is ) in the hb , there are important differences : m5 has about twice as many stars in the hb as ngc 6629 , which is a consequence of m5 being brighter and then more massive , and hence it is not a surprise that it has about twice as many rrl .",

    "the more metallic ooi clusters may have both blue and red hbs and display a large dispersion .",
    "those clusters for which we have explored the rr lyrae distribution are plotted with filled symbols while empty symbols are used otherwise .",
    "three ooi clusters are also labelled ; despite their closeness in the plot the only one with a clear rrab - rrc segregation is ngc 6229 , while ngc 3201 , and now m5 ( see fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) , show both blazhko and stable rrab stars well distributed all across the is , in the either - or region , i.e. to the blue of the first - overtone red border .",
    "it should be noted however that in all cases stable rrc stars are well confined to the blue of the first - overtone red border as expected . in passing",
    "let us mention that this is yet another important difference between m5 and `` its twin '' ngc 6229 .",
    "it is true that we have explored only three ooi clusters and that an analysis of a larger number of both types of oosterhoff clusters is desirable ; however , we might preliminarily conclude that blue - tailed ooii clusters seem to have their rrab and rrc stars systematically well segregated around the red border of the first - overtone instability strip . however , ooi clusters may or may not have this property .    . the reduced period @xmath34 is defined as @xmath39.,width=313,height=207 ]     as a function of [ fe / h]@xmath38 for galactic gcs of different oosterhoff types , according to the legend , with data taken from catelan ( 2009 ) .",
    "inner and outer halo clusters are represented by circles and squares respectivelly , width=302,height=283 ]    .",
    "[ fel ]    the distribution of rrl on the hb may be explained by the arguments of caputo et al .",
    "( 1978 ) which involve the occurrence of a hysteresis mechanism ( van albada & baker 1973 ) for stars crossing the is . according to this mechanism the stars in the `` either - or '' region can retain the mode they were pulsating in before entering the region , which depends on whether the star is coming from the blue side as an rrc or from the red side as an rrab .",
    "caputo et al . ( 1978 ) also suggest that the original mode in which a rrl is pulsating depends on the location of the starting point at the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) , which in turn depends on the mass and the chemical composition of the star ; they used these ideas to explain the existence of the two oosterhoff groups as follows ; 1 ) the zahb point is in the fundamental zone , leading to an assortment of rrc and rrab in the `` either - or '' region and a lower value of the average period for both rrc and rrab and a lower proportion of rrc stars , hence an ooi cluster , and 2 ) the zahb point is bluer than the fundamental zone , in the `` either - or '' or in the first overtone regions , then the `` either - or '' region is populated exclusively by rrc stars and the rrab stars are to be found only in the fundamental region , producing larger averages of periods and a higher proportion of rrc and hence an ooii type cluster .",
    "the above scenario explains well the clean segregation of rrc and rrab seen in the ooii clusters , or the definitive lack of segregation in ooi clusters like ngc  3201 or m5 , but , as commented by arellano ferro et al .",
    "( 2015b ) , the clean segregation observed in the ooi cluster ngc  6229 is at odds with the above picture .",
    "furthermore , rrab - rrc segregation in ooii clusters is also favoured by the arguments of pritzl et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that in clusters with blue hbs , i.e. large values of @xmath27 , stars with masses below a critical mass on the zahb to the blue of the is , evolve redwards and spend sufficient time to contribute to the population of rrl .",
    "thus , clusters with a blue hb morphology are ooii , with redwards evolution , which in turn favours the segregation between rrc and rrab on the is which , in passing , should at least statistically display increasing secular period variations",
    ". unfortunately there are few clusters with a large enough number of rrl with secularly changing periods that have been studied ; e.g. the ooii clusters omega cen ( martin 1938 ) and m15 ( silbermann & smith 1995 ) and the ooi clusters m3 ( corwin & carney 2001 ) and m5 ( szeidl et al . 2011 ) ; in all these clusters only a small surplus , and probably not statistically significant , of rrl are reported as having increasing periods .",
    "growing evidence of the existence of multiple stellar populations in gcs ( see for instance jang & lee ( 2015 ) and the references therein ) invites us to consider whether this is connected with the observed rrab - rrc splitting discussed above .",
    "according to jang & lee ( 2015 ) , in inner - halo gcs the time elapsed between the first stellar generation ( g1 ) and a helium ( @xmath40 ) and cno enhanced second generation ( g2 ) is @xmath30 0.5 gyr while in the outer - halo gc s , g1 has been delayed by @xmath30 0.8 gyr and the time between g1 and g2 has been longer , @xmath30 1.4 gyr .",
    "they have demonstrated that for metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath41 , in outer gc s the is is mostly ( but not exclusively ) populated by g1 while the @xmath40- and cno - enhanced g2 rr lyrae stars must be more luminous ( see their figure 7 ) with an average @xmath42d , which agrees very well with the observed @xmath43d in m5 . for inner gc s of similar metallicity",
    "the mix of g1 and g2 in the is is likely more due to the shorter time between generations in which case @xmath44d . for lower metallicity outer gc s , [ fe / h]@xmath45 , the is is populated basically by g2 stars .",
    "we shall recall that for a @xmath40- and cno - enhanced g2 , the masses on the zahb are shifted towards lower temperatures ( jang et al .",
    "2014 , their figure 3 ) , hence displacing the first overtone red - edge ( fre ) to the red ( bono caputo & marconi 1995 ) .",
    "more than one generation sharing the is will have different fre boundaries contributing to a mix of rrc and rrab stars .",
    "what effect the above scenario might have on the presence or not of the rrab - rrc splitting is not clear at present as several factors seem to play a role ; the overall metallicity , the presence of more than one generation in the is and the time elapsed between generations . we could add to this the possible presence of pre - zahb rr lyrae stars ( silva aguirre et al .",
    "2008 ) . clearly more investigation of a larger sample of gc s is necessary to confront the observations with theoretical predictions .",
    "we speculate that in outer - halo ooii clusters the larger time difference between generations favours the existence of an rrab - rrc splitting as we have generally observed .",
    "the distance to m5 can be estimated from our data using different approaches ; firstly , from the weighted mean @xmath17 , calculated for the rrab and rrc from the fourier light curve decomposition ( table [ fisicos ] ) , which can be considered as independent estimates since they come from different empirical calibrations and zero points .",
    "secondly , we can use the @xmath14-band rr lyrae p - l relation derived by catelan , pritzl & smith ( 2004 ) . as a third approach",
    "we can use the three known sx phe stars and their p - l relation . and",
    "finally a fourth approach is via the bolometric magnitude for stars at the tip of the rgb .",
    "below we expand on these solutions .",
    "being m5 a nearby cluster , its reddening is small , we adopted @xmath46=0.03 mag ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "given the mean @xmath17 for rrl in table [ fisicos ] we found a true distance modulus of @xmath47 mag and @xmath48 mag using 38 rrab and 24 rrc stars respectively , which correspond to the distances @xmath49 and @xmath4 kpc .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are the standard deviations of the corresponding means .",
    "the distance to m5 listed in the catalogue of harris ( 1996 ) ( 2010 edition ) is 7.5 kpc in good agreement with our calculations .",
    "the @xmath14-band rr lyrae p - l relation derived by catelan , pritzl & smith ( 2004 ) is of the form :    @xmath50    with @xmath51 -1.765 $ ] .",
    "we applied these equations to all 62 rrab and rrc stars in table [ fisicos ] .",
    "the periods for the rrc stars were fundamentalized following the period ratio @xmath52 in double mode stars ( catelan 2009 ) .",
    "we found an average distance of 7.2@xmath260.3 kpc .",
    "an independent estimate of the distance can be obtained from the three sx phe known in the cluster .",
    "[ sxpl ] shows the p - l relationship of cohen & sarajedini ( 2012 ) ;    @xmath53    positioned for the rrl mean distance .",
    "the first - overtone and second - overtone lines were positioned adopting the frequency ratios @xmath54= 0.783 and @xmath55 = 0.571 ( see santolamazza et al .",
    "2001 or jeon et al . 2003 ; poretti et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it seems clear from the plot that v164 is a fundamental pulsator while v160 and v170 pulsate in the first - overtone .",
    "then , adopting eq .",
    "[ eqn : pl_cs ] we find an average true distance modulus of @xmath56 or a distance of @xmath5 kpc .",
    "the uncertainty was calculated from calibration errors neglecting the uncertainty in the period .",
    "yet another approach to the cluster distance determination is by using the tip of the rgb .",
    "this method was developed for estimating distances to nearby galaxies ( lee , freedman & madore , 1993 ) .",
    "one possibility is to use the specific calibration of the bolometric magnitude of the tip of the rgb , of m5 by viaux et al .",
    "( 2013 ) under the arguments that the neutrino magnetic dipole moment enhances the plasma decay process , postpones helium ignition in low - mass stars , and therefore extends the red giant branch ( rgb ) in gcs .",
    "these authors came to the conclusion that in m5 @xmath57= -4.17 @xmath26 0.13 mag and we adopted that value .",
    "as in arellano ferro et al .",
    "( 2015b ) for the case of ngc 6229 , we found that the method is extremely sensitive to the star selection .",
    "reasonable results are found for the stars nearest to the tip of the rgb , i.e. the reddest and brightest in this region of the cmd .",
    "we restricted our calculation to the two brightest rgb stars in our sample v50 and v174 . according to viaux et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the trgb is between 0.05 and 0.16 mag brighter than the brightest stars on the rgb .",
    "the fact that v50 and v174 may not be the brightest stars on the rgb implies that their magntiudes would have to be corrected to bring them to the trgb by at least the above quantities ; the larger the correction the smaller the resulting distance .",
    "we applied a correction between 0.05 and 0.16 mag to v50 and v174 and found a mean distance of between 7.5 and 7.2 kpc respectively .",
    "the above independent estimations of the cluster distance are , within their uncertainties , satisfactorily in agreement . however , given the sensitivity of the sx phe p - l and the trgb approaches to the number of stars involved as well as to the sample selection , we believe that the distance determinations from the rrl stars , which deal with much larger samples and carefully calibrated zero points of the luminosity scale are the best achieved .    for the metallicity , the overall average value from the rrl is [ fe / h]@xmath58 or [ fe / h]@xmath59 found from the fourier decomposition of the light curves of 38 rrab and 24 rrc . these values can be compared with previous values in the literature : [ fe / h]@xmath60 ( harris 1996 ) ; [ fe / h]@xmath61 ( kaluzny et al . 2000 ) from an independent fourier decomposition analysis ; [ fe / h]@xmath62 ( zinn 1985 ) ; [ fe / h]@xmath63 ( carretta et al .",
    "2009 )      the age of m5 has been discussed in numerous works .",
    "we have not attempted an independent estimation .",
    "the age of m5 was determined by jimenez & padoan ( 1998 ) via its luminosity function and they found an age of @xmath64 gyr assuming [ @xmath65/fe]=+0.4 .",
    "two more recent determinations of the age of m5 are by dotter et al .",
    "( 2010 ) using relative ages from isochrone fitting , and by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2013 ) using an improved calibration of the  vertical method  or the magnitude difference between the turn off point and the hb ; these authors find 12.25@xmath260.75 gyr and 11.50@xmath260.25 gyr respectively .",
    "thus , in the cmd of fig .",
    "3 we have overlayed the corresponding isochrones for 12.0 gyr from the victoria - regina evolutionary models ( vandenberg et al . 2014 ) and for the metallicities [ fe / h]=@xmath66 ( red ) and [ fe / h]=@xmath67 ( blue ) and [ @xmath65/fe]=+0.4 , shifted for the average apparent distance modulus @xmath68=14.395 mag found from the rrab and rrc stars , and @xmath69 .",
    "the isochrones for these two metallicities are very similar except perhaps at the tip of the rgb where the isochrone for the more metal - rich composition gets less luminous . however ,",
    "if shifts are applied to these isochrones within the uncertainty of the distance modulus and reddening , @xmath70 mag , the two cases are indistinguishable .",
    "we can stress then that our cmd is consistent with the metallicity and distance derived in this paper and an age of @xmath71 gyr found in the above papers for m5 .",
    "the fourier decomposition of the light curves of stable rrl , and the calibrations and zero points available in the recent literature allowed us to determine the mean metallicity and distance to m5 as [ fe / h]@xmath72 and @xmath24 and @xmath1 kpc and @xmath73 kpc , from the rrab and rrc stars respectively .",
    "also individual values of radius and mass are provided .",
    "the employment of the @xmath74 rr lyrae p - l relation leads to a distance of 7.2@xmath260.3 kpc .",
    "the distance to the cluster was also estimated from two independent methods ; the p - l relation of sx phe and the luminosity at the tip of the rgb finding 7.7@xmath260.4 kpc and 7.5@xmath260.1 kpc respectively .",
    "however we have shown that in the case of m5 the accuracy of these two alternative methods does not compete with the accuracy attained with the rr lyraes and the fourier light curve decomposition .",
    "a group of 16 evolved stars have been identified from their distribution in the amplitude - period plane",
    ". evolved stars should be moving to the red in the cmd , hence their periods should be increasing . from the period change study of szeidl et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and our own period change analysis , which will be published elsewhere , we can see that some stars have increasing periods ( v11 , v16 , v39 , v45 , v77 , v87 and v90 ) and some have clearly decreasing periods ( v9 , v12 and v17 ) , which might be unexpected in truly evolved stars .",
    "however it is understood now that stochastic processes may produce both positive , negative or irregular period variation , e.g. mixing events in the core of a star at the hb ( sweigart & renzini 1979 ) or , as suggested more recently by silva aguirre et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , period decreases can occur in pre - zahb rr lyrae stars on their final approach to the zahb . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ cmd ] we have drawn a small line segment from the corresponding circles , to the right or left to indicate period increase or decrease respectively . the remainder of the evolved stars were not found to be undergoing secular period variations in our analysis . from their position on the cmd , their long period value and large period change rate , we conclude that v77 and v87 are truly advanced in their evolution towards the agb .    for the most luminous stars in the is ( v107 , v122 and v158 ) we argue that they are not truly evolved stars but owe their overluminosity to a helium enhanced atmosphere or to the presence of an unseen companion .",
    "we note that in the hb instability strip of m5 , rrab stars share the either - or region with rrc stars , like in the case of the ooi cluster ngc 3201 , but in contrast with ngc 6229 , a cluster presumably nearly a twin of m5 , where the rrab - rrc splitting is noticeable .",
    "we also highlight the fact that the rrab - rrc splitting is a common feature in ooii clusters with a blue tail .",
    "our ccd @xmath75 time - series , spanning a little more than two years , allowed us to detect amplitude and phase modulations in 14 rrab and 9 rrc stars not previously reported as having the blazhko effect .",
    "these new findings account for incidence rates of at least 38% and 26% of the rrab and rrc respectively showing the blazhko effect in m5 .",
    "this comes as a natural result since in the last few years the detection of blazhko variables in gcs has been increasing , most likely due to the improvement in the quality of the ccd observations and reduction techniques .",
    "take for example the cluster ngc 5024 with the largest known population of blazhko variables with 66% and 37% of rrab and rrc respectively ( arellano ferro et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "finally , it is well known from key studies in the past ( e.g. oosterhoff 1941 , szeidl et al .",
    "2011 ) that a large fraction of the rrl population of m5 is undergoing secular period variations . our present data add up to 20 years to the time - base of available data for m5 and a re - analysis of the period change rates is deferred to a forthcoming paper .",

    "( 2015a ) to be misidentified in the literature . in that paper the identifications",
    "have been discussed and corrected and a detailed identification chart is given .",
    "* v14*. in the cvsgc ( 2014 update ) it is noted as an unconfirmed variable , probably after evstigneeva et al . ( 1995 )",
    ". however the star is clearly variable in the study of kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and in the present work .",
    "it displays some amplitude modulation already noted by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    *",
    "v18*. it displays a tremendous amplitude variation from 0.617 mag in 2012 to 1.218 mag in 2013 and 2014 .",
    "the observations on january 23 , 2013 are already consistent with the large amplitude , meaning that the star underwent the amplitude change between may 2012 and january 2013 . the photographic light curve from 1934 from oosterhoff ( 1941 ) , although a bit scattered , shows an amplitude of 0.76 mag and while not directly comparable with our @xmath13 or @xmath14 light curve amplitudes we mention that oosterhoff himsef noted considerable light curve variations and suggested to classifiy it as an irregular variable . the data from 1997 of kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show an amplitude of 1.27 mag and a mild suggestion of the blazhko effect .",
    "the repetitivity of our light curves from february to may in 2012 at the low amplitude and again during 2013 - 2014 at the large amplitude , suggests that the star remains with a constant amplitude before it goes through the amplitude variation episodes : it is therefore a very strong blazhko modulator with a rather long period .",
    "according to szeidl et al .",
    "( 2011 ) the blazhko period is longer than 500d .      *",
    "v27*. despite its relative isolation it shows a very peculiar light curve .",
    "we have not been able to identify more than one period .",
    "thus the observed amplitude and phase modulations must be due to the blazhko effect .",
    "we adopted the period of szeidl et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that phases the light curve best .",
    "they did not find secular period changes for this star .",
    "the blazhko modulations are very prominent .",
    "* v28*. similar to v18 , this star shows a very pronounced amplitude modulation from 1.120 mag to 0.653 mag with much different time distributions than v18 .",
    "the amplitudes in the light curves of oosterhoff ( 1941 ) and kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are in between the above two extremes .",
    "* v42 , v84*. these two w virginis ( cw ) stars are shown in the cmd of fig .",
    "[ cmd ] and their light curves are displayed in fig .",
    "the data are included in the electronic table [ tab : vi_phot ] .",
    "their periods are listed in table [ variables ] .",
    "for v42 the period 25.735d given in the cvsgc phases our data correctly .",
    "for v84 the period 53.95d in the cvsgc does not phase our data properly but we found that about half of it , 26.49d , produces a nice light curve .          * v77*. this is the rrab with the largest period in m5 ( 0.845158d ) .",
    "it has a low amplitude and a peculiar shape of the light curve with a roundish maximum . in the amplitude - period diagram ( fig .",
    "[ bailey ] ) the star falls in the extreme right of the diagram , much beyond the evolved stars sequence . in the cmd ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) it is one of the brightest stars . the star is undergoing a secular period increase with a rate among the largest in m5 ( szeidl et al . 2011 ) .",
    "all these properties are consistent with the star being in an advanced evolutionary state towards the agb .    *",
    "v78*. this star has the shortest period among the known rrl stars in m5 ( 0.264820d ) .",
    "kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have argued that it may be a second overtone pulsator ( rre ) and noted the slight asymmetry of the light curve .",
    "we point out that while the asymmetry is there , it appears as prominent as in the other rrc stars with longer periods ( e.g. v15 , v55 , v60 etc . ) .",
    "in fact , an inspection of the light curves of the rrc stars in fig . [ varsc ]",
    "reveals that a slight asymmetry is present in most of them , so this seems to be more the rule than the exception in this cluster .",
    "however , following catelan s ( 2004 ) practice , we have checked the log p - @xmath78 plane and confirmed that , after fundamentalizing the period of v78 assuming that it is a second - overtone pulsator , the star falls in the natural extension to short period of the rrab distribution .",
    "this seem to support the idea that v78 is a rre .",
    "* v104*. it has been noticed by several authors that the light curve of this peculiar star shows very prominent amplitude and phase modulations .",
    "it has been suggested to be a double mode star ( reid 1996 ) and a semi - detached binary ( drissen & shara 1998 ) .",
    "its rather long period for an rrc star and its position among rrab stars on the log p - @xmath78 plane make it more likely to be an rrab star .",
    "we used period04 to search for traces of double mode activity but found no significant secondary frequencies .",
    "our light curve is very peculiar indeed and shows multiple rr lyrae - like curves , all well phased with a period of 0.486748 , with phase and mean brightness displacements .",
    "it is probably an rrab in a binary system , unfortunatelly we could only estimate five times of maximum on our data and two in the light curve of drissen & shara ( 1998 ) and thus , with the handful of times of maximum the corresponding o - c diagram does not shed clear signs of duplicity .",
    "* v121*. this star is close to the center of the cluster but it is not blended with another star of similar magnitude or brighter . despite this , it shows large modulations in phase and amplitude probably due to the presence of blazhko effect . the light curves in caputo el al .",
    "( 1999 ) and drissen & shara ( 1998 ) look stable but their time - base are very short .    * v127*. this star is very close to another of similar brightness .",
    "it is identified in the discovering paper ( kravtsov 1988 ) and we confirm that the variable is the nw of the pair ( see fig . [ chart ] ) . in the paper by olech",
    "( 1999 ) its light curve appears as that of a small amplitude rrc - like with a period 0.544965d .",
    "however our period 0.540366d produces a clear rrab light curve with amplitude apparently diminished due to flux contamination by the neighbour . on the bailey diagram ( fig .",
    "[ bailey ] ) the star clearly sits among the rrab stars .",
    "it also shows amplitude modulations .",
    "* v156*. the variability of this star and a nice looking rrab light curve were reported by drissen & shara ( 1998 ) from their high resolution images of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and they labelled it as v15 .",
    "the star identified by these authors is strongly blended in our images and we were not able to either calculate a period at confidence or recover a rrl - like light curve , hence it was not included in fig .",
    "[ varsaba ] . in fig .",
    "[ v156 ] we show the nightly light variations and note the changes of the maximum brightness , inviting the suggestion of blazhko modulations .",
    "caputo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) offered an alternative identification and named the star v156 , however the light curve of that star does not show variations in our collection .      *",
    "v157*. the light curve of this star has an anomalously low amplitude , likely due to blending in our images with a close bright star .",
    "its position in the cmd ( fig .",
    "[ cmd ] ) and bailey diagram ( fig .",
    "[ bailey ] ) is therefore peculiar .",
    "* v158*. it is noted in the cvsgc as `` rrc ? '' indeed its period 0.442627d is rather long for an rrc , however , its light curve is a little asymmetric and resembles that of the other rrc stars in the cluster . in the bailey s diagram ( fig .",
    "[ bailey ] ) , the star falls halfway between the rrc and the rrab distributions .",
    "we have labelled it as rrc .",
    "we have identified a few close pairs of variable stars in our images that , depending on the seeing conditions may or may not have contaminated each other s light curves .",
    "we list them below and briefly discuss them .      *",
    "v109-v142*. these two rrab stars are separated by only 4.0 pixels or 1.2 arcsec in our images and hence the interference of each other s light curves which is evident as noise ( see table [ tab : observations ] ) .",
    "the light curve of v142 shows very prominent phase and amplitude modulations .",
    "the variability was discovered by brocato , castellani & ripepi ( 1996 ) but the light curve was not made available .",
    "partial light curves were displayed by caputo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and drissen & shara ( 1998 ) where the variations are clear but no modulation was detected , most likely due to the limited time - base of these data sets .",
    "* v112-v113*. the separation of these stars is 7.4 pixels or 2.2 arcsec which means that in nights of poorer seeing their light curves are contaminated by the light of the neighbour producing noisier light curves .",
    "* v130-v131*. these stars are separated by 8.4 pixels or 2.5 arcsec , i.e. ocassionally , on nights of poorer seeing there is mutual light contamination .",
    "scatter in the light curve of v130 was noted by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) but their search for a secondary frequency was futile .",
    "our light curve shows clear amplitude modulations which could be attributed to the blazhko effect .",
    "v131 is not included by kaluzny et al . both stars included by caputo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show no amplitude modulations but their light curves are sparse . in our data v131 also shows mild amplitude modulations .",
    "it is possible that the observed amplitude modulations are due , at least partially , to the light contamination from the neighbour .    .",
    "a systematic and thorough analysis of 50 rrab stars in m5 was conducted by jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in search of blazhko - type variability and its characterization , using a collection of photometry of m5 covering nearly 100 years .",
    "they identified 20 blazhko stars among the rrab population and calculated the modulation periods ( their table 1 ) .",
    "the modulation periods range mostly between 40 and 600 days , with the exception of v72 for which the modulation is about 1200 days .",
    "the time - base of our data is 770 days ( see table [ tab : observations ] ) .",
    "this means that based only on our observations we should be able to detect the modulations in all those variables , provided that the modulations are strong enough and the photometry is of good quality . of the 20 stars found by jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2011 ) four ( v2 , v29 , v58 and v72 ) are not in the fov of our images .",
    "the remaining 16 stars are labelled @xmath79 in table [ variables ] , however v5 , v30 and v38 , look rather stable in our light curves , thus we would have been unable to identify these as blazhko variables based exclusively on our data .",
    "we find it difficult to judge the real blazhko nature of these three stars .",
    "we note first that the blazhko modulations reported by jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are in all cases very mild and that for v5 and v38 the blazhko classification relies on a comparison between the data from reid ( 1996 ) , whose light curves are a bit scattered , and the data from kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1999 ; 2000 ) separated by 5 years ; both stars are in crowded fields and kaluzny et al .",
    "2000 has pointed out that neighbours at 5 - 10 arcsec affect some of the photometric data . for the more isolated star v30 the comparison was between the data of storm et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1999 ; 2000 ) separated by 10 years , reduced and transformed to the standard system by different approaches . while these details may contribute to apparent amplitude differences",
    ", it is also possible that our data time - base is not long enough for the detection of a long - period modulation . for the other 13 stars the modulations are also evident in our data .    besides the above mentioned stars",
    ", we have also been able to detect amplitude - phase modulations in the light curves of another 14 rrab stars , some of which are subtle but visible , hence probably undetectable in old photographic data .",
    "these 14 newly identified blazhko rrab stars are labelled @xmath77 in table [ variables ] .",
    "this makes a total of 30 blazhko stars in m5 in a sample of 79 rrab stars , i.e. an occurrence rate of at least 38% .    .",
    "no blazkho rrc variables were reported by jurcsik et al .",
    "however , the modulations are clearly visible in 9 stars of the 34 in our sample ; v35 , v40 , v44 , v53 , v55 , v99 , v120 , v130 and v131 .",
    "this makes an incidence rate of at least 26% for rrc blazhko variables in m5 .    .",
    "the presence of bumps near the maximum light in rrc stars is clear in v31 , v35 , v57 , v60 , v62 , v95 , v100 , v105 , v108 , v113 , v116 , v130 and v133 .",
    "bumps were noted before by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in v31 , v35 , v57 and v62 and highlighted that bumps do not occur for stars with periods above 0.28 - 0.30 d , which is true also for our extended list of `` bumpy '' stars with the exception of v108 and v130 with p@xmath300.328 , although we may concede that the bump in these cases is rather mild .",
    "kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) venture the possibility that the bump is associated with some sort of interaction between the first and second overtones .",
    "the bump was actually reproduced in the rrc star u com by hydrodynamical models constraining the metallicity and calibrating the adopted turbulent convection model .",
    "the bump was found to be sensitive to the parameters governing the coupling between convection and pulsation ( bono , castellani & marconi 2000 ) ."
