    "carma processes are the continuous - time analogs of the widely known discrete - time arma processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a comprehensive introduction ) ; they were first defined in @xcite in the univariate gaussian setting and have stimulated a considerable amount of research in recent years ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the restriction of the driving process to brownian motion was relaxed and @xcite allowed for lvy processes with finite logarithmic moments .",
    "because of their applicability to irregularly spaced observations and high - frequency data , they have turned out to be a versatile and powerful tool in the modeling of phenomena from the natural sciences , engineering and finance . recently , @xcite extended the concept to multivariate carma ( mcarma ) processes with the intention of being able to model the joint behavior of several dependent time series .",
    "mcarma processes are thus the continuous - time analogs of discrete - time vector arma ( varma ) models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : first , we establish the equivalence between mcarma and multivariate continuous - time state space models , a correspondence which is well known in the discrete - time setting @xcite ; second , we investigate the probabilistic properties of the discrete - time process obtained by recording the values of an mcarma process at discrete , equally spaced points in time .",
    "a detailed understanding of the innovations of the weak varma process which arises is a prerequisite for proving asymptotic properties of statistics of a discretely observed mcarma process .",
    "one notion of asymptotic independence which is very useful in this context is complete regularity ( see section [ section - results ] for a  precise definition ) and we show that the innovations of a discretized mcarma process have this desirable property",
    ". our results therefore not only provide important insight into the probabilistic structure of carma processes , but they are also fundamental to the development of an estimation theory for non - gaussian continuous - time state space models based on equidistant observations .    in this paper , we show that a sampled mcarma process is a discrete - time varma process with dependent innovations .",
    "while the mixing behavior of arma and more general linear processes is fairly well understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the mixing properties of the innovations of a sampled continuous - time process have received very little attention . from @xcite",
    ", it is only known that the innovations of a discretized univariate lvy - driven carma process are weak white noise , which , by itself , is typically of little help in applications .",
    "we show that the linear innovations of a sampled mcarma process satisfy a set of varma equations and we conclude that under a mild continuity assumption on the driving lvy process , they are geometrically completely regular and , in particular , geometrically strongly mixing .",
    "this continuity assumption is further shown to be satisfied for most of the practically relevant choices of the driving lvy process , including processes with a non - singular gaussian component , as well as compound poisson processes with an absolutely continuous jump size distribution and infinite activity processes whose lvy measures admit a density in a neighborhood of zero .    this paper is structured as follows . in section [ section - mlp ] we review some well - known properties of lvy processes , which we will use later .",
    "the class of multivariate carma processes , in a slightly more general form than in the original definition of @xcite , is described in detail in section  [ section - mcarma ] and shown to be equivalent to the class of continuous - time state space models . in section  [ section - results ] the main result about the mixing properties of the sampled processes is stated and demonstrated to be applicable in many practical situations .",
