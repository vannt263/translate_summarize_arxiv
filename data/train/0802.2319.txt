    "geometric properties of critical two - dimensional systems of statistical mechanics have attracted considerable interest of both physicists and mathematicians in recent years . on the one hand ,",
    "methods of quantum gravity have been successfully applied by duplantier to obtain the multifractal spectrum of harmonic measure on critical cluster boundaries @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the invention of the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) by schramm @xcite has made it possible to study conformally - invariant critical curves rigorously ( several reviews of sle are available by now ; see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "conformal field theory ( cft ) has been a natural and traditional language for description of critical statistical systems in two dimensions .",
    "it is important to understand how fractal properties of critical curves can be obtained from cft .",
    "a part of the emerging picture is that the stochastic geometry of critical curves can be studied by traditional methods of cft .",
    "as any local field theory , cft focuses on correlation functions of local operators .",
    "it turns out that the stochastic geometry of critical curves is related to correlators of certain primary fields in cft .",
    "this connection , first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been further developed in our papers @xcite where we have identified the curve - creating primary operators and considered their correlators with other primaries serving as `` probes '' of harmonic measure . along this way we have reproduced duplantier s results for multifractal exponents associated with harmonic measure .",
    "in addition to harmonic measure , complicated planar domains and their boundaries are characterized by winding or rotation .",
    "the notion of rotation spectrum for planar domains has been introduced by binder in ref . @xcite .",
    "then the mixed rotation and harmonic measure spectrum has been found exactly for critical curves by duplantier and binder @xcite . in that paper",
    "the authors combined an earlier coulomb gas approach to the distribution of winding angles of critical curves @xcite with the quantum gravity methods of refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend our previous analysis @xcite to include the winding ( rotation ) of critical curves .",
    "as it happens , to account for rotation of critical curves , we need to consider cft primary fields with _ complex _",
    "weights and charges .",
    "the procedure involves an analytic continuation of chiral correlation functions and then gluing the chiral sectors to obtain real but angular dependent correlators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ formulation of problem ] we formulate the problem and give heuristic definitions of various objects of interest including harmonic measure and rotation of critical curves . in section [ one point ]",
    "we consider a special case of a single probe of harmonic measure and rotation near a star configuration of several critical curves .",
    "then we go on to the general case , where several probes can be placed in the vicinity of a critical star configuration .",
    "we conclude in section [ discussion ] with a discussion and comparison with other works .",
    "consider a two - dimensional critical statistical system .",
    "such systems can be formulated as critical points in an ensemble of curves on a lattice , e.g. the loops of the @xmath1 model or the high-@xmath2 expansion loops of the @xmath3-state potts model .",
    "when the system is critical , these curves are called critical curves . in the continuum limit , statistical systems are invariant under conformal transformations and can be described by a cft with a certain central charge @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the critical curves are fluctuating fractal curves .",
    "any conformal transformation in two dimensions locally looks like a combination of rotation and a scale transformation ( dilatation ) . for a given composition of dilatation and rotation in the plane there exist curves which remain invariant .",
    "they are logarithmic spirals @xmath5 .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 characterizes the winding of a spiral and is called the rate of rotation . for a pure dilatation",
    "the spirals degenerate into straight lines ( no rotation : @xmath7 ) which may intersect and form corners with arbitrary opening angles .    since any conformal transformation is locally a composition of dilatation and rotation , a conformally invariant critical curve",
    "can be thought of as an assembly of elementary corners and logarithmic spirals at all scales .",
    "the so called multifractal analysis aims at determining the fractal dimensions of the subsets of a critical curve with given opening angle and winding .",
    "these fractal dimensions form a continuous family of multifractal exponents .",
    "harmonic measure is another way of characterizing the complicated fractal geometry of a critical curve . in a simple electrostatic analogy",
    "we can imagine that a critical cluster is charged with a unit charge that all goes to the boundary of the cluster .",
    "charge density ( which is the density of harmonic measure ) on the boundary is very uneven and lumpy , and can be characterized by its moments .",
    "therefore , in the ensemble of critical curves it is natural to characterize their fractal geometry by the statistics of local winding and harmonic measure near some point on the curve .",
    "locally , near a charged corner the scaling of the charge density or , equivalently , of the magnitude of the electric field @xmath8 is determined by the opening angle @xmath9 at the corner : @xmath10 .",
    "what will be important for us in the following is that this power - law behavior is the same along all straight lines that converge at the apex of the corner .",
    "all these lines intersect the equipotentials at constant angles @xmath11 , and only one of them is an electric field line ( corresponding to @xmath12 ) . in mathematics",
    "such lines are sometimes called `` slanted green lines '' , while the electric field lines are called `` green lines '' . in a general situation",
    "we will denote the slanted green line that goes from the origin and forms the angle @xmath11 with equipotentials by @xmath13 .",
    "similar statements can be made for a logarithmic spiral .",
    "the information about the rate of rotation @xmath6 of a spiral is contained in the winding of any of the slanted green lines that emanate from the spiral s origin .",
    "it is easy to see that the line @xmath13 is the rotated logarithmic spiral @xmath14 ( with @xmath12 again corresponding to the unique electric field line going from the origin ) , and we can follow any of them to `` measure '' @xmath6 .",
    "the information on the scaling of the magnitude of the electric field and the winding of a slanted green line near a certain point on the critical curve is contained in the value of the derivative of a uniformizing conformal map @xmath15 that maps the exterior of the critical cluster onto a standard simple domain . in these terms",
    ", the electrostatic potential of the curve is @xmath16 , the magnitude of the field near the curve is @xmath17 , and the direction of the field is related to @xmath18 .",
    "( in terms of the complex potential @xmath19 we have @xmath20 . )",
    "we will use this idea extensively in what follows .",
    "it is convenient for our purposes to restrict the statistical ensemble so that a critical curve always passes through a fixed point , and work in the vicinity of this point .    in this paper",
    "we consider only dilute critical systems , which means that critical curves generically do not intersect ( see , however , the discussion of exceptional star configurations below ) .",
    "this choice is dictated by the nature of our problem . in the dense phase where critical curves have multiple points , the harmonic measure is only supported on the external perimeters of critical clusters ( think of electric charge spreading on the surface of a conductor ) .",
    "the external perimeters are always simple critical curves described by a model in the dilute phase , and it is sufficient to consider dilute systems in our problem .",
    "the prime example of this phenomenon is provided by critical percolation : percolation hulls intersect themselves at all scales , while the external perimeters of percolation clusters are simple curves in the universality class of self - avoiding random walks .    in the absence of boundaries in the system critical curves are closed loops",
    ". if the system has a boundary and the boundary condition changes at certain boundary points , it gives rise to critical curves which start and end at these points .",
    "a hole in the system is a component of the boundary .",
    "if the boundary condition changes on it , we will observe critical curves emanating from the hole . on scales",
    "much larger than the size of the hole the latter becomes a puncture . in this case",
    "there are critical curves coming out of a single point in the bulk of the system . inserting a puncture at some point in the bulk",
    "we can ensure that in each realization of the statistical ensemble there is a `` star ''  a fixed number @xmath21 of curves starting from this point .",
    "[ star page ] generally speaking , a critical system need not contain punctures or be restricted in any way by insertion of curve - creating operators .",
    "these are merely artificial devices which we will use in our calculations .",
    "the meaning of @xmath22 stars is obvious : any point on a curve is such a star .",
    "in fact , stars with @xmath23 can also be meaningful even in the absence of punctures .",
    "a star with an even number @xmath24 of legs is a point of self - intersection of a critical curve . since in the dilute phase",
    "the latter are simple curves with probability one , stars with @xmath25 can only appear as exceptional configurations in rare realizations of the statistical ensemble , all such realizations having the total weight ( probability ) zero .",
    "in fact , we can quantify this discussion by assigning a negative fractal dimension @xmath26 ( see eq .",
    "( [ d_k ] ) below ) to the set of stars with @xmath25 legs .",
    "the meaning of a negative fractal dimension is as follows .",
    "if in a system of size @xmath27 several curves approach each other within a distance @xmath28 , then on the scales much larger than @xmath28 the configuration of the curves will look like a star .",
    "however , in a typical realization of the statistical ensemble , the number of points where such approach happens , scales as @xmath29 , and goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in the rest of the paper we apply methods of cft to the problem of the mixed multifractal spectrum of harmonic measure and winding of critical curves . in this approach",
    "a @xmath21-legged star of critical curves is created by an insertion of a specific curve - creating operator @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this operator can be realized as a vertex operator in the coulomb gas formulation of cft , and has known holomorphic charge @xmath31 and weight @xmath32 , see eqs .",
    "( [ central charge ] , [ cc - charge ] , [ cc - weights ] ) below .",
    "other primary operators inserted close to the curve - creating one can then serve as probes for the harmonic measure .",
    "this has been explained and used in our previous works @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will see that to account for winding of critical curves , the probes must have complex charges and conformal weights .",
    "we want to point out here that while harmonic measure can behave nontrivially and be probed both in the bulk and on a boundary of a critical system , the mixed spectrum that takes into account winding is only defined in the bulk .",
    "indeed , there is no way a critical curve can rotate around a point on a boundary .",
    "therefore , our present analysis only deals with the bulk curve creating operators .",
    "for simplicity we start with the case of the electric field ( both the magnitude and the direction ) measured at a single point and then generalize the method to multiple points .",
    "consider a @xmath21-legged star  @xmath21 critical curves emanating from the origin in the bulk of the system .",
    "we are interested in the properties of the star much closer to the origin than the system boundaries .",
    "the shape of the legs of the star far from the origin is unimportant , which allows us to trace each leg only up to a certain distance from the origin .",
    "let us describe the shape of such a truncated star by an analytic function @xmath15 which maps the exterior @xmath33 of the star onto the exterior of the unit disk @xmath34 .",
    "the statistical ensemble of the shapes of the star defines the statistical ensemble of @xmath15 .    .",
    "the point @xmath35 is chosen to lie on the dotted circle of a fixed radius and so that @xmath15 lies on the same radial line as @xmath36.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    close to the origin the @xmath21 curves of the star divide the plane into @xmath21 sectors .",
    "approached from different sectors , the origin is mapped onto @xmath21 points @xmath37 on the unit circle : @xmath38 for @xmath35 in the @xmath39-th sector . to make @xmath15 unique we specify @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the conformal radius of the star .",
    "its fluctuations are unimportant . for each realization of the star we can choose the truncation radius so that @xmath43 .    as we have explained above",
    ", the magnitude and the direction of the electric field at a point @xmath35 are determined by @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "both these quantities are random .",
    "conformal invariance suggests that locally @xmath44 scales as a power of @xmath46 and @xmath45 behaves as @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we can study the joint moments of @xmath44 and @xmath48 expecting them to scale as @xmath49 & \\sim    \\label{definition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes average over the fluctuating geometry of the star .",
    "this equation defines the multifractal exponents @xmath51 , and our goal below is to obtain them using methods of cft .",
    "let us now discuss a subtle point about eq .",
    "( [ definition ] ) . we can treat the average over the star shapes in two ways .",
    "the first way is to specify the position of point @xmath35 in such a way that for any star @xmath33 this point is on the slanted green line @xmath13 in , say , the first sector ( the choice of the sector is arbitrary and immaterial ) .",
    "let us denote this choice by @xmath52 ( implicitly keeping in mind that the choice depends on the star shape ) .",
    "then the average in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ definition ] ) should be understood as @xmath53 & \\sim |z_\\theta|^{\\delta_k(n , p ) } , \\label{fixed theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( only the argument of @xmath52 fluctuates here , while @xmath54 is fixed ) .",
    "the simplest such choice is to place @xmath35 on the electric field line @xmath55 .",
    "then in the @xmath56 plane the image @xmath15 lies on a radial straight line : @xmath57 see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for illustration .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we have argued in the previous section , the scaling of @xmath44 and @xmath48 should be the same along _ any _ line @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we can average ( integrate ) over @xmath11 ( and sum over the different sectors ) in eq .",
    "( [ fixed theta ] ) while keeping @xmath54 constant .",
    "this procedure produces a manifestly rotationally invariant average . in this average",
    "we can distribute the contributions that come from star shapes which differ by a global rotation around the origin into sets , and then sum up all such sets . due to isotropy of our critical system",
    ", all terms in a given set have the same statistical weight .",
    "therefore , to calculate the average , we can choose any single term from each set and sum these up .",
    "we can choose these terms so that @xmath58 is the same for all of them , which gives the left hand side in eq .",
    "( [ definition ] ) with a _ fixed _",
    "point @xmath35 .",
    "this is the second way to interpret the average over the star shapes .",
    "as we see , the two ways are equivalent and produce the same scaling behavior with the multifractal exponents @xmath51 .",
    "a critical system is characterized by the central charge @xmath4 which we parametrize , as is usual in cft , by the so called background charge @xmath59 : @xmath60 as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the coulomb gas description of the dilute phase we have to impose the dirichlet conditions on the system boundaries . a consistent way of doing it also implies that the background charge @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ central charge ] ) is non - positive : @xmath61 .    within the cft description ( see @xcite for introduction to the mathematical apparatus of cft used below ) a @xmath21-legged star centered at the origin is created by inserting the curve - creating operator @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "this operator has holomorphic charge @xmath63 and its antiholomorphic charge is @xmath64 .",
    "it is spinless with real conformal weights : @xmath65    to calculate the mixed multifractal exponents @xmath51 by means of cft we consider a primary operator @xmath66 whose holomorphic and antiholomorphic weights @xmath67 are complex and conjugate to each other : @xmath68 ( notice that we use asterisk to denote complex conjugation , while the bar over a weight or charge simply indicates the antiholomorphic sector . )",
    "its holomorphic and antiholomorphic charges are related to the weights by the equations @xcite @xmath69 ( the introduction of the charges is convenient because they make fusion of primary operators look simple : the charges of the fused fields simply add up . )",
    "note the sign difference in the formula for @xmath70 compared to that in ref .",
    "the difference is necessitated by our convention ( @xmath71 ) for the dilute phase .",
    "the solutions @xmath72 , @xmath73 are chosen so that @xmath74 : @xmath75 the two charges are related by @xmath76 . if we denote the real and imaginary parts of the holomorphic charge as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the real and imaginary parts of the holomorphic weight @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80    the operator @xmath81 plays the role of a `` probe '' of harmonic measure and rotation of critical curves when we place it at a point @xmath35 near the origin of a @xmath21-star .",
    "the star is created by inserting the curve - creating operator @xmath62 .",
    "thus we propose to consider the following correlation function : @xmath82 here and in what follows these angular brackets denote a cft average and @xmath83 stands for all operators far from the origin and is necessary to make the correlation function non - zero . the right hand side in eq .",
