    "consider the @xmath0 wave equation with non - homogeneous boundary conditions : @xmath4 system ( [ contwavecontrolled ] ) is said to be _ exactly controllable _ in time @xmath5 if , for all @xmath6 , there exists a control function @xmath7 such that the solution of ( [ contwavecontrolled ] ) can be driven at rest at time @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9    we also introduce the adjoint @xmath0 wave equation with homogeneous boundary conditions : @xmath10    this system is well known to be well posed in the energy space @xmath11 and the energy below is conserved in time : @xmath12    the hilbert uniqueness method ( hum ) introduced in @xcite allows showing that the property of _ exact controllability _ for ( [ contwavecontrolled ] ) is equivalent to the _ boundary observability _ of ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) .",
    "the _ observability property _ of the wave equation ensures that the following _ observability inequality _ holds for all solutions of ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) provided @xmath5 : @xmath13    the best constant @xmath14 in ( [ contobsineq ] ) is the so - called _",

    "it is also well known that for all @xmath21 and all solutions @xmath22 of the adjoint problem ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) with initial data @xmath23 , the following _ admissibility inequality _ holds : @xmath24 so that for all @xmath5 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are equivalent norms .    as a consequence of these results ,",
    "it is easy to see that for all @xmath6 , there exists a control @xmath7 driving the solution of ( [ contwavecontrolled ] ) to the rest at @xmath27 , i.e. such that ( [ contnullcontrol ] ) holds .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to the fact that @xmath28 for all solutions @xmath22 of ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) , where @xmath29 is the duality product between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    the hum control @xmath32 , the one of minimal @xmath33-norm , has the explicit form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the solution corresponding to the minimum @xmath36 of the quadratic functional @xmath37    the effect of substituting the continuous controlled wave equation ( [ contwavecontrolled ] ) or the corresponding adjoint problem ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) by discrete models has been intensively studied during the last years , starting from some simple numerical schemes on uniform meshes like finite differences or linear @xmath2 - finite element methods in @xcite and , more recently , more complex schemes like the discontinuous galerkin ones in @xcite .",
    "in all these cases , the convergence of the approximation scheme in the classical sense of the numerical analysis does not suffice to guarantee that the sequence of discrete controls converges to the continuous ones , as one could expect .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are classes of initial data for the discrete adjoint problem generating high frequency wave packets propagating at a very low group velocity and that , consequently , are impossible to be observed from the boundary of the domain during a finite time , uniformly as the mesh - size parameter tends to zero .",
    "this leads to the divergence of the discrete observability constant as the mesh size tends to zero .",
    "high frequency pathological phenomena have also been observed for numerical approximation schemes of other models , like the linear schrdinger equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , in which one is interested in the uniformity of the so - called _ dispersive estimates _ , which play an important role in the study of the well - posedness of the non - linear models .",
    "several _ filtering techniques _ have been designed to face these high frequency pathologies : the _ fourier truncation method _",
    "@xcite ) , which simply eliminates all the high frequency fourier components propagating non - uniformly ; the _ bi - grid algorithm _ introduced in @xcite and @xcite and rigorously studied in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite in the context of the finite differences semi - discretization of the @xmath0 and @xmath38 wave equation and of the schrdinger equation ( cf.@xcite ) , which consists in taking initial data with slow oscillations obtained by linear interpolation from data given on a coarser grid ; and the _ numerical viscosity _ method , which by adding a suitable dissipative mechanism damps out the spurious high frequencies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we should emphasize that the _ mixed finite element method _ analyzed in @xcite is , as far as we know , the unique method that preserves the propagation and controllability properties of the continuous model uniformly in the mesh size without requiring any extra filtering .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the survey articles @xcite and @xcite for a presentation of the development and the state of the art in this topic .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyze the behavior of the quadratic @xmath1 - finite element semi - discretization of the problems ( [ contwavecontrolled ] ) and ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) from the uniform controllability / observability point of view . in * section [ sectintrop2 ]",
    "* we introduce in a rigorous way the discrete analogue of ( [ contwavecontrolled ] ) and ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) and explain the minimization process generating the discrete controls . in * section [ sectfour ] * we analyze the spectral problem associated to this discrete model and reveal the co - existence of two main types of fourier modes : an _ acoustic _ one , of physical nature , related to the nodal components of the numerical solution , and an _ optic _ one , of spurious nature , related to the curvature with which the quadratic finite element method perturbs the linear approximation .",
    "we also study finer properties of the spectrum , for example the _ spectral gap _ , identifying three regions of null gap : the highest frequencies on both acoustic and optic modes and the lowest frequencies on the optic one .",
    "the content of this section is related to previously existing work .",
    "for instance , the dispersive properties of higher - order finite element methods have been analyzed in @xcite in the setting of the helmholtz equation .",
    "an explicit form of the acoustic dispersion relation was obtained for approximations of arbitrary order .",
    "it was shown that the numerical dispersion displays three different types of behavior , depending on the approximation order relative to the mesh - size and the wave number . in * section [ sectboundobseig ]",
    "* we obtain some spectral identities allowing us to analyze the discrete observability inequality for the adjoint system . in * section [ sectingham ] * we show that the _ fourier truncation _ of the three pathological regions of the spectrum leads to an uniform observability inequality . in * section [ sectbigrid ] * we prove that a filtering mechanism consisting in , firstly , considering piecewise linear initial data and , secondly , preconditionning the nodal components by a bi - grid algorithm guarantees uniform observability properties . within the proof",
    ", we use a classical _ dyadic decomposition argument _",
    "@xcite ) , which mainly relies on the fact that for this class of initial data the total energy can be bounded by the energy of the projection on the low frequency components of the acoustic dispersion relation .",
    "we should emphasize that our results are finer than the ones in @xcite or @xcite , where one obtains uniform observability properties for finite element approximations of any order , but by filtering the fourier modes much under the critical scale @xmath39 .",
    "here we only consider the particular case of quadratic finite element approximation on @xmath0 meshes , but we get to the critical filtering scale @xmath39 .",
    "note however that the results in @xcite and @xcite apply in the context of non - uniform grids as well . in * section [ sectconvergence ]",
    "* we present the main steps of the proof of the convergence of the discrete control problem under the assumption that the initial data in the corresponding adjoint problem are filtered through a fourier truncation or a bi - grid algorithm .",

    "the function @xmath60 can be identified with the vector of its coefficients , @xmath61 ( in the sequel , all vectors under consideration will be column vectors ) .",
    "thus , using @xmath62 , @xmath63 , as test functions in ( [ p2waveadjointvar ] ) , system ( [ p2waveadjointvar ] ) can be written as the following system of @xmath64 second - order linear differential equations ( odes ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the following @xmath68 _ pentha - diagonal mass _ and _ stiffness _ matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 we introduce the discrete analogue of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 spaces to be @xmath74 for the elements of the space @xmath75 we have to impose the additional requirement @xmath76 .",

    "the total energy of its solutions is conserved in time : @xmath101    one of the goals of this paper is to study discrete versions of the observability inequality ( [ contobsineq ] ) of the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a @xmath104 _ observability matrix operator_. the observability inequality ( [ p2observabilityinequalitygeneral ] ) makes sense for rather general matrices @xmath103 , corresponding , for instance , to the observability from any open subset contained in the spatial domain @xmath105 .",
    "but , within this paper , we focus on the particular case of _ boundary observation operators _ @xmath103 , in the sense that they approximate the normal derivative @xmath106 of the solution of the continuous adjoint problem ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) at @xmath17 .",
    "the main example of such boundary matrix operators @xmath103 that will be used throughout this paper is as follows : @xmath107    the operator @xmath103 is also the one used for the finite difference semi - discretization in @xcite . let us remark that at the discrete level there are different ways to approximate the normal derivative of the continuous solution of ( [ contwaveadjoint ] ) . since @xmath108 is a vector and @xmath106 is a scalar , the way in which @xmath108 approximates @xmath109 needs to be further explained .",
    "remark that @xmath103 in ( [ observationoperators ] ) is almost a null matrix , excepting the penultimate component on the last row .",
    "the last component of @xmath108 , the only non - trivial one , equals to @xmath110 .",
    "the consistency analysis shows that if @xmath111 is a sufficiently regular function and @xmath87 is its quadratic interpolation , then @xmath112 is a first - order approximation of @xmath113 .",
    "we are interested in observability inequalities ( [ p2observabilityinequalitygeneral ] ) in a finite , but sufficiently large observability time , say @xmath114 . in this paper",
    "we show that , when working on the whole discrete space @xmath115 , the observability constant @xmath116 blows - up as @xmath117 , whatever @xmath21 is .",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is to design appropriate subspaces @xmath118 on which the observability constant @xmath116 is uniformly bounded as @xmath117 .",
    "we will also prove that the discrete version of ( [ contdirectinequality ] ) below holds uniformly as @xmath117 in the approximate space @xmath98 for all @xmath21 : @xmath119    once the observability problem is well understood , we are in conditions to address the discrete control problem . for a discrete control function @xmath98 , we consider the following non - homogeneous problem : @xmath120    here , the superscript @xmath121 denotes matrix transposition",
    ". multiplying system ( [ p2controlledpbm ] ) by any solution @xmath122 of the adjoint problem ( [ p2adjoint ] ) , integrating in time and imposing that at @xmath27 the solution is at rest , i.e. @xmath123 we obtain that @xmath124 necessarily satisfies the following identity which fully characterizes all possible exact controls @xmath124 : @xmath125    in view of this , we introduce the following discrete version of the quadratic functional ( [ contfunctional ] ) : @xmath126 @xmath122 being the solution of the adjoint problem ( [ p2adjoint ] ) with initial data @xmath127 and @xmath128 the initial data to be controlled in ( [ p2controlledpbm ] ) .",
    "the functional @xmath129 is continuous and strictly convex .",

    "accordingly , the controls @xmath136 only act on @xmath137 when @xmath124 is the numerical control obtained by ( [ p2optimalcontrol ] ) .",
    "consequently , the boundary observability operator @xmath103 does not act really at @xmath17 , but at @xmath138 , being in fact an internal control acting on a single point which is closer and closer to the boundary as the mesh size parameter becomes smaller , so that in the limit as @xmath117 it becomes a boundary control .",
    "observe also that the control problem we deal with is a coupled system of non - homogeneous odes modeling the interaction between the nodal and the midpoint components .",
    "thus , the node @xmath139 lies in fact on the boundary of the midpoint component .",
    "consequently , the controls @xmath136 in ( [ p2controlledpbm ] ) , with @xmath124 as in ( [ p2optimalcontrol ] ) , are really natural approximations of the continuous boundary controls @xmath32 in ( [ contwavecontrolled ] ) .",
