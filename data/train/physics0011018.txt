    "it has long been the case that pressure determinations for incompressible flows , both navier - stokes and magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) , are known to be highly non - local .",
    "taking the divergence of the equation of motion @xmath1 and using @xmath2 leaves us with a poisson equation for the pressure @xmath0 , which is said to function as an equation of state : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the fluid velocity field as a function of position and time , @xmath5 is the magnetic field , @xmath6 is the electric current density , @xmath7 is the speed of light , @xmath8 is the kinematic viscosity , assumed spatially uniform and constant , and @xmath0 is the pressure normalized to @xmath9 the mass density , also spatially uniform .",
    "( [ eq : eqmo ] ) and ( [ eq : pe ] ) are written for mhd .",
    "their navier - stokes equivalents can be obtained simply by dropping the terms containing @xmath5 and @xmath10 .    if we are to solve ( [ eq : pe ] ) for @xmath0 , boundary conditions are required . in the immediate neighborhood of a stationary  no - slip \" boundary ,",
    "both the terms on the left of ( [ eq : eqmo ] ) vanish and we are left with the following equation for @xmath11 as a boundary condition : @xmath12    we now focus on the navier - stokes case , where the magnetic terms disappear from ( [ eq : bcs ] ) , for simplicity .",
    "all the complications of mhd are illustrated by this simpler case .",
    "it is apparent that ( [ eq : bcs ] ) must apply to all components of @xmath11 , and that while the normal component of @xmath11 is enough to determine @xmath0 through neumann boundary conditions , the tangential components of ( [ eq : bcs ] ) at the wall equally well determine @xmath0 through dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this is a problem which some inventive procedures have been proposed to resolve , usually by some degree of  pre - processing \" or various dynamical recipes which seem to lead to approximately no - slip velocity fields after a few time steps ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is not our purpose to review or critique these recipes , but rather to focus on a set of velocity fields , related to chandrasekhar - reid functions @xcite , for which ( [ eq : pe ] ) is explicitly soluble at a level where the neumann or dirichlet conditions can be exactly implemented . in   [ sec : pdetermin ] , we explore the difference between the two pressures so arrived at .",
    "then in   [ sec : discussion ] , we propose a replacement for the long - standing practice of demanding that all components of a solenoidal @xmath13 vanish at material walls , in favor of a replacement by a wall friction term for which the above mathematical difficulty is no longer present .",
    "of course , similar statements and options will apply to all comparable incompressible mhd problems .",
    "restricting attention at present to the navier - stokes case , we consider two - dimen- sional , solenoidal , velocity fields obtained from the following stream function : @xmath14 \\label{eq : sf}\\ ] ] the hyperbolic cosine term in ( [ eq : sf ] ) contributes a potential flow velocity component to @xmath13 which makes it possible to demand that @xmath15 obey two boundary conditions : the vanishing of both components at rigid walls @xcite .",
    "the function in ( [ eq : sf ] ) is even in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but can obviously be converted into an odd or mixed one by the appropriate trigonometric substitutions .",
    "the velocity field @xmath18 has only @xmath16 and @xmath17 components and is periodic in @xmath16 , with an arbitrary wavenumber @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a normalizing constant , and the constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 can systematically be found numerically to any desired accuracy so that both components of @xmath13 vanish at symmetrically placed no - slip walls at @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in fact , for given @xmath19 , an infinite sequence of such pairs of @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be determined straightforwardly .",
    "thus any such @xmath13 , or superposition thereof , is not only solenoidal , but has both components zero at @xmath25 , and all spatial derivatives exist .",
    "moreover , the  source \" term , or @xmath26 , from the right hand side of ( [ eq : pe ] ) , is of a relatively simple nature for such a @xmath13 , since every term in it can be written as a product of exponentials of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is straightforward to find an inhomogeneous solution for @xmath0 , which then is the same for all boundary conditions for a given @xmath13 of the form stated . to this inhomogeneous part of @xmath0",
    "must be added a solution of laplace s equation .",
    "this can be chosen so that the total @xmath0 may satisfy either the normal component of ( [ eq : bcs ] ) at the walls , or the tangential component of it , but not both .",
    "the determination involves only simple but tedious algebra .     using @xmath30 from ( [ eq : sf ] ) with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33,height=336 ]    we illustrate , in figure  [ fig : vfield ] , an arrow plot of the velocity field given by choosing @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 , in units of @xmath36 .",
    "the two pressures resulting from the satisfaction of the normal and tangential components of ( [ eq : bcs ] ) can best be compared by comparing their respective values of @xmath11 , since @xmath0 itself is indeterminate up to an additive constant in both cases . in figure",
    "[ fig : gradp ] , we display , as an arrow plot , the difference between the pressure gradients associated with the velocity field shown in figure  [ fig : vfield ]",
    ". we have rewritten ( [ eq : eqmo])-([eq : bcs ] ) in dimensionless units for this purpose , with the kinematic viscosity being replaced by the reciprocal of a reynolds number , which may be defined as @xmath37 . here , the angle brackets refer to the mean of @xmath38 taken over the 2-d box , containing one period in the @xmath16 direction and from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the value of  used to construct figure  [ fig : gradp ] is @xmath41 , with the dimensionless version of @xmath42 in ( [ eq : sf ] ) .",
    "the two pressures are similar but not identical .     with @xmath43,height=336 ]    in figure  [ fig : contour ] , a fractional measure of the difference between the  neumann pressure \" @xmath44 and the  dirichlet pressure \" @xmath45 is exhibited as a contour plot of the scalar ratio @xmath46 there is no absolute significance to the numerical value of this ratio .",
    "it initially increases with approaching a maximum of about @xmath47 near the wall for @xmath48 .",
    "it is considered interesting however , that the fractional difference is nearly x - independent where it is largest .",
    "that occurs formally because the algebra reveals it to be dominated by a term which varies as @xmath49 in a region where @xmath50 .     with @xmath43 .",
    "note that the fractional difference between the two values of @xmath11 is significant only near the wall.,height=336 ]    it is amusing but perhaps not significant to superpose the velocity field from ( [ eq : sf ] ) with a parabolic plane poiseuille flow of a larger amplitude .",
    "the resulting flow field is shown in figure  [ fig : vstreet ] , and it bears a striking but perhaps not significant similarity to the flow patterns seen in two - dimensional plane poiseuille flow @xcite when linear stability thresholds are approached . the pressure gradient difference for this case will be fractionally smaller than in figure  [ fig : contour ] , since pure parabolic plane poiseuille flow is a rare case where the two pressures happen to agree , and it quantitatively dominates the pressures determined from equation ( [ eq : pe ] ) in this example .     plus parabolic plane poiseuille flow : @xmath51 with @xmath52,height=336 ]",
    "an alternative to the no - slip condition is the ",
    "navier \" boundary condition @xcite : the slip velocity at the wall surface is taken to be proportional to the rate of shear at the wall .",
    "this may be expressed @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the slip velocity of the fluid at the wall , @xmath55 is the rate of shear at the wall and @xmath56 is a constant with the dimensions length .",
    "molecular dynamic simulations of newtonian liquids under shear @xcite have shown this to be the case under some circumstances .",
    "in fact recent work @xcite has shown that , in cases where the shear rate is large , there is a nonlinear relationship between @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the velocity field shown in figure  [ fig : vfield ] does not lead to one which obeys the navier boundary condition , after an initial time step , where the fluid has been allowed to slip at the wall .",
    "if the velocity field determined by ( [ eq : sf ] ) is advanced in time using ( [ eq : eqmo ] ) with the  neumann pressure \" , the proportionality between the slip velocity and the rate of shear at the wall , after the initial time step , varies sinusoidally with @xmath16 .",
    "it is difficult to see in what sense the velocity field obtained from ( [ eq : sf ] ) might be an unacceptable one from the point of view of the navier - stokes or mhd descriptions .",
    "it seems to have all the properties that are thought to be relevant .",
    "the family of functions of the same x - periodicity in ( [ eq : sf ] ) can be shown to be orthogonal , and is a candidate for a complete set , in which any @xmath13 might be expanded , when supplemented by flux - bearing functions of y alone .",
    "the mathematical question of which if any velocity fields , which are both solenoidal and vanish at the wall , would lead to neumann and dirichlet pressures that were in agreement with each other , must remain open . indeed , the question of whether there are any , without some degree of  pre - processing , \" must remain open .",
    "this is an unsatisfactory situation for fluid mechanics and mhd , in our opinion , even if it is a not unfamiliar one .",
    "the search for alternatives seems mandatory .",
    "one alternative that may be explored is one that seemed some time ago , in a rather different context [ shan & montgomery 1994a , b ] , to have worked well enough for mhd .",
    "namely , we may think of replacing the requirement of the vanishing of the tangential velocity at a rigid wall with a wall friction term , added to the right hand side of ( [ eq : eqmo ] ) , of the form @xmath57 where the coefficient @xmath58 vanishes in the interior of the fluid and rises sharply to a large positive value near the wall .",
    "the region over which it is allowed to rise should be smaller than the characteristic thickness of any boundary layer that it might be intended to resolve , but seems otherwise not particularly restrictive .",
    "such a term provides a mechanism for momentum loss to the wall and constrains the tangential velocity to small values , but does not force it to zero .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition disappears in favor of a relation that permits the time evolution of the tangential components of @xmath13 , while demanding that @xmath0 be determined solely by the neumann condition ( the normal component of ( [ eq : bcs ] ) only ) . in a previous mhd application [ shan & montgomery 1994a , b ] dealing with rotating mhd fluids , the scheme seemed to perform acceptably well , but was not intensively tested or benchmarked sharply against any of the better understood navier - stokes flows .",
    "this comparison seems worthy of future attention .",
    "the work of one of us ( d.c.m . ) was supported by hospitality in the fluid dynamics laboratory at the eindhoven university of technology in the netherlands .",
    "a preliminary account of this work was presented orally at a meeting of the american physical society @xcite ."
