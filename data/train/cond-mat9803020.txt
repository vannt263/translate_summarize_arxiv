    "there are many problems in physics in which multi - particle interactions play an important rle .",
    "one may mention nuclear forces , solid @xmath5 @xcite , adsorbed systems@xcite and plasmas@xcite .",
    "it is known from some exact results@xcite that the critical properties of models with many body forces generally depend on the range of interaction .",
    "recently considerable effort has been made to clarify the properties of a simple one - dimensional quantum model described by the hamiltonian@xcite : @xmath6 here the @xmath7 , @xmath8 are pauli matrices at site @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the exchange coupling and the transverse field , respectively .",
    "the classical statistical mechanical equivalent of this model is a two - dimensional square lattice ising model with mixed @xmath0-spin and two - spin interactions@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ e : hamilton ] ) is self - dual@xcite and the self - dual point is @xmath12 independent of @xmath0 . according to numerical studies @xcite",
    "there is one phase transition in the system , which takes place at the self - dual point , and the transition changes from second to first order , when @xmath13 . in the borderline case",
    "@xmath14 the transition is conjectured@xcite to belong to the four state potts universality class , a conjecture which is supported by an approximate mapping@xcite and by numerical studies@xcite .    concerning the simple structure of the model , its self - dual symmetry and the expected relation to q - state potts models",
    ", one can also pose the question , whether the model is integrable , at least in its self - dual point . to find an answer to this question in this paper we are going to study the statistical properties of the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "as it has been established in a series of papers @xcite the spectrum of a hamiltonian ( or the transfer matrix for classical statistical mechanical models ) has different statistical properties for integrable and non - integrable models and one can make a close connection to the theory of the spectral properties of random matrices . in the actual calculation",
    "we first make use of all all those symmetries of the hamiltonian which do not depend on the value of the couplings , and for large finite lattices we block - diagonalize the eigenvalue matrix of the problem .",
    "the statistical analysis of the energy levels is then performed for each block separately . in a non - integrable model ,",
    "in which no further internal symmetry is present the matrix - elements of a block - matrix are expected to be loosely correlated , so that they can be approximately represented by random entries . indeed the spectrum of non - integrable models is found to belong to the class of orthogonal random matrices , to the so called gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) and the level spacing distribution is described by the wigner surmise@xcite : @xmath15 on the other hand if the hamiltonian is integrable by the bethe ansatz there is an infinite number of internal symmetries and consequently the matrix - elements of a block - matrix are strongly correlated . loosely speaking integrable hamiltonians",
    "are so peculiar that they are not well described by an ` average hamiltonian ' .",
    "then one expects that in this case the eigenvalues themselves behave like independent random numbers , so that the spectrum of integrable models belongs to the ensemble of diagonal random matrices and the level spacing distribution is described by the poissonian ( exponential ) distribution : @xmath16 .",
    "numerical studies of integrable models @xcite are indeed in agreement with this assumption .    in this paper",
    "we are going to perform the analysis of the level statistics of the multispin coupling hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e : hamilton ] ) . we are going to answer two questions .",
    "the first question is whether or not the hamiltonian is integrable , at least at the transition ( self - dual ) point .",
    "our second question concerns the characteristics of the level distribution at a first order transition point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the symmetries of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e : hamilton ] ) , which are essential to perform a block - diagonalization , are presented in section 2 .",
    "the statistical analysis of the spectrum of the block - diagonalized hamiltonian is given in section 3 , while the results are discussed in the final section .",
    "as described in the introduction the first step in a statistical analysis of the energy eigenvalues is to block - diagonalize the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e : hamilton ] ) using all those symmetries of the model which do not depend on the actual values of the couplings . before analyzing these symmetries ,",
    "let us first notice that if @xmath17 denotes the set of energies of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ e : hamilton ] ) , one has @xmath18 .",
    "this can be seen introducing the operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 and noting that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 if @xmath24 and -1 otherwise . on a finite lattice this symmetry holds for periodic boundary conditions and if the length of the chain is a multiple of @xmath0 . in what follows",
    "we consider this type of lattices and restrict ourself to the case @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the symmetries of the model are of three types : i ) _ space - like symmetries _ , which describe invariance of the system under geometrical transformations ( translation , inversion , etc ) ;  ii ) _ gauge symmetries _ , which are connected to invariance of the hamiltonian under internal transformations ; and finally iii ) _ duality symmetries _ , which make a connection between the strong- and weak - coupling regimes of the hamiltonian .",
    "\\i ) the _ space symmetry _ of the model on a finite lattice depends on the boundary condition . in a statistical analysis of the spectrum of finite systems",
    "it is desired to use the most symmetric boundary condition to get a block structure , which well represents the statistical behavior of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , as already mentioned , we apply periodic boundary conditions , which can be formally expressed as @xmath27 .",
    "the space symmetry group is then the automorphy group of a ring , irrespective of the range of the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "this is the dihedral group generated by the translation @xmath28 and the reflection @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) which both commute with @xmath32 .",
    "\\ii ) the _ gauge symmetries _ are generalizations of the spin - reversal symmetry for the well known @xmath33 case .",
    "recalling that we take @xmath34 to be a multiple of @xmath0 , let us introduce a set of @xmath35 operators @xmath36 for @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the bits of the binary representation of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is such that @xmath42 the spin reversal symmetry , which holds when @xmath0 is even , is @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the condition eq .",
    "( [ e : cond ] ) ensures that all the operators @xmath46 commute with @xmath47 .",
    "it is also clear that these operators are diagonal , involutive and form an abelian group ( @xmath48 is the identity ) .",
    "this implies that all the @xmath49 representations are one - dimensional and the corresponding projectors are of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 for all @xmath45 and @xmath29 .",
    "all these projectors split the hilbert space in @xmath52 invariant subspaces of size @xmath53 each .",
    "for example , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 even , @xmath54 projects onto the subspace with an even number of up spins , while @xmath55 projects onto the subspace with an odd number of up spins .",
    "the projector @xmath56 projects onto the most symmetric subspace to which the ground state belongs ( we refer now to this subspace as the ground - state sector ) , whereas the other @xmath57 sectors become degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , in this limit , the degeneracy of the ground state in the strong coupling phase @xmath58 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "this degeneracy for the @xmath14 model is just four , which led debierre and turban@xcite to conjecture the same universality class for the transition as that for the @xmath59 state potts model .",
    "the combination of the space symmetry and the gauge symmetry is not obvious , since the operators of these two groups do _ not _ commute in general .",
    "the product of these two groups is a semi - direct product , ( not a direct product ) since the gauge group is a normal subgroup . as usual",
    "the states are labelled by the number of the representation , @xmath29 , to which they belong .",
    "we have computed the character table of the symmetry group from which the dimensions of the invariant subspaces are deduced and then the block - diagonal hamiltonian is constructed .",
    "the dimensions of the irreducible representations and the size of the corresponding blocks are given in tables i - iii for different values of @xmath0 , in the range of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for @xmath34 even and odd , respectively .",
    "we note that in the ground state sector , which is labelled by @xmath62 and corresponds to @xmath63 all the operators of the space and gauge symmetry group commute , so that _ in this sector _ we have a representation of the dihedral group . in what follows we use the same labelling convention as in @xcite .",
    "\\iii ) as mentioned in the introduction the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e : hamilton ] ) has the property of _ duality symmetry_. to show this and its consequences in finite lattices , first we define , for an infinite lattice , dual pauli operators @xmath64 as @xmath65 in terms of which the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ e : hamilton ] ) is expressed as @xmath66 consequently the two sets of energies @xmath67 and @xmath68 are equal : @xmath69 and the self - dual point @xmath70 corresponds to the transition point of the system , provided there is one single phase transition in the system .",
    "the duality symmetry , as described above holds in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. when the length of the system @xmath71 . in a _",
    "finite system _ duality generally relates sectors of the hamiltonian with different boundary conditions . with periodic boundary conditions",
    "one has the symmetries @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which in terms of the dual operators in eq .",
    "( [ e : dualpaulix ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ e : dualpauliz ] ) are only satisfied in the ground state sector of the hamiltonian . as a result self - duality holds only in the ground state sector , which is indeed verified numerically .",
    "based on this observation we expect somewhat different statistical properties of the energy levels in the self - dual and non - selfdual sectors .",
    "using the symmetries as described in the previous section we have performed the block - diagonalization of the eigenvalue matrices for large finite lattices , the size of which was a multiple of the length of the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "we went up to @xmath74 and 15 for @xmath14 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the size of the blocks , as seen in tables i - iii , is relatively small , especially for larger values of @xmath0 their size is reduced by gauge symmetry .",
    "having the block - diagonalized hamiltonian we solved their spectrum by standard numerical methods , which are contained in the lapack library .",
    "the next step , before performing the analysis , is to unfold the spectrum , i.e. to subtract the average tendency and to keep only the fluctuations , which are normalized in the same manner at each part of the spectrum .",
    "technical details relating to unfolding the spectrum are given in ref .",
    "the unfolded spectrum is then analyzed and several spectral quantities are determined and compared with the predictions of random matrix theory .",
    "first , we consider the level spacing distribution , @xmath77 , which is expected of the wigner form in eq .",
    "( [ e : wigner ] ) for non - integrable models , whereas it is generally of the poissonian form for integrable models . to analyze realistic spectra",
    "it is often useful to consider brody s interpolation formula : @xmath78 with @xmath79^{1+\\beta}$ ] , which corresponds to the wigner and the poisson form for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the interpolation parameter @xmath82 , which is determined by an optimalization fit , proved itself to be a useful indicator for the localization of integrable varieties@xcite .",
    "another quantity characterizing the independence of the eigenvalues is the spectral rigidity in an interval of length @xmath9 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the integrated density of unfolded eigenvalues and @xmath85 denotes an average over @xmath86 .",
    "finally , we shall also consider the number variance @xmath87 defined as the variance of the number of unfolded eigenvalues in an interval of length @xmath9 : @xmath88 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle_{\\epsilon}\\ ; , \\label{e : variance}\\ ] ] where the brackets denote an averaging over @xmath89 .",
    "first we presents the results of the statistical analysis of the spectra _ outside the transition point_. as seen in figs .",
    "[ f : pdsgeneric ] and [ f : s2d3generic ] on the example of the @xmath14 model at a coupling @xmath90 for a 15-site chain , all the three characteristic quantities of the spectrum are very well described by the wigner distribution @xcite .",
    "[ f : s2d3generic ] presents the rigidity and the number variance for the same parameters . the expected behavior for independent random energies and for the eigenvalues of the goe are also shown .",
    "the goe behavior is observed up to quite large values of @xmath34 , indicating that goe matrices provide a good description of the hamiltonian .",
    "the data shown are obtained averaging over all the representations .",
    "however very similar results are obtained averaging only over the self - dual sector .",
    "the characteristic parameters of the spectrum do not depend on whether the sector under consideration is selfdual or non - selfdual we also note that very similar behavior is found for other ranges of the interaction @xmath2 or for other values of @xmath91 . consequently there is no evidence for the integrability of the model with @xmath4 away from the critical point .    in the following we investigate the level statistics of the model as a function of the ratio @xmath92 and calculate the interpolation parameter @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ e : brody ] ) as a best fit over the self - dual and non - selfdual sectors .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : betadeh ] for @xmath93 and @xmath14 , whereas data for the largest system size are only included in the self - dual sector .",
    "we note that the corresponding data for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and a less extensive calculation for @xmath94 , lead us to very similar conclusions .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ f : betadeh ] that brody s parameter @xmath82 has different behavior in the self - dual and in the non - selfdual sectors . while in the non - selfdual sectors",
    "@xmath82 is approximately constant and its value @xmath95 corresponds to the goe result , in the self - dual sector there is a change in the value of @xmath82 around the self - dual point .",
    "actually its value drops from @xmath80 to about @xmath96 at the transition point .",
    "the region , where the change in @xmath82 takes place seems to shrink only to the self - dual point in the thermodynamic limit , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : betadeh ] by comparing the results with @xmath93 and @xmath97 .",
    "this observation leads us to study carefully the spectral properties of the models _ at the transition point _ , the results of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : mixture](a ) .",
    "as seen in the figure the level spacing distribution could not be well fitted by the interpolation formula in eq .",
    "( [ e : brody ] ) , at least with the symmetries we have taken into account .",
    "however , it is given approximately by the arithmetic average of the wigner and poisson distributions , which is also shown in the figure .",
    "we argue that the measured spectral quantities in the self - dual sector can be interpreted as if the spectrum is composed of two independent wigner distributions . to check our assumption",
    "we have taken two non - selfdual blocks of roughly the same size each of which has wigner characteristics and merged the levels of the two blocks .",
    "then we analyzed the level statistics of the combined blocks and the obtained results in fig .",
    "[ f : mixture](b ) looks very similar to those we found for the self - dual sector and presented in fig .",
    "[ f : mixture](a ) .",
    "thus at this point we conclude that the spectrum of the self - dual sector at the self - dual point is seemingly composed of two independent parts , each having wigner - type characteristics .",
    "this type of behavior is the result of an extra symmetry , the _ self - duality _ , which is just seen in the selfdual sector . furthermore , we argue that this extra symmetry is manifested by the crossing of energy levels at the self - dual point in the thermodynamic limit @xmath71 . to see this",
    "we have calculated the quantity : @xmath98 which measures the asymmetry in the the level spacing distribution . for _ independent _ random variables chosen according to a wigner",
    "distribution one has : @xmath99 yielding a mean value @xmath100 . for matrices from the goe , the correlation between spacings @xmath101 modifies this value .",
    "we have numerically found that this value does not vary considerably with the size of the matrix , and is very close to @xmath102 as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : delta ] for non - selfdual sectors @xmath103 is indeed close to the goe result in ( [ e : dgoe ] ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath104 is found in the self - dual sector far from the self - dual point , however there is a sharp increase in @xmath103 in the neighborhood of @xmath105.@xcite since the value of @xmath103 at the self - dual point is monotonically increasing with the size of the system ( see tab .",
    "[ t : delta ] ) , one expects that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath106 . thus there is an exact degeneracy in the selfdual sector at the transition point , which should be connected with the presence of an extra symmetry .",
    "the possible origin of this extra symmetry is discussed in the final section .",
    "in this paper we have studied the statistical properties of the spectrum of a transverse - field ising spin chain with @xmath0-spin interactions and compared to the predictions of random matrix theory .",
    "away from the transition point , which is known exactly from duality symmetry , the spectrum is shown to be a gaussian orthogonal ensemble and its properties are well described by the wigner distribution . on the other hand at the transition point the spectral properties of the selfdual and non - selfdual sectors are different .",
    "while the spectra of non - selfdual sectors are close to the wigner distribution the same for the selfdual sector can be described as the composition of two independent wigner distributions .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that this special behavior at the transition point is the result of level crossing in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this observation can be compared with the known exact@xcite and numerical@xcite results on the two - dimensional @xmath107 potts model . as known exactly@xcite ,",
    "this model is also self - dual and there is a first order transition in the system . as an analogous quantity to the hamiltonian in ( eq .  [ e : hamilton ] ) we consider the @xmath108 transfer matrix of the potts model , which in the hamiltonian limit@xcite is given by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denotes the lattice spacing and @xmath111 is the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional quantum potts model .",
    "according to exact results@xcite in the thermodynamic limit the ground state of @xmath111 at the transition point is @xmath112-fold degenerate . at this point",
    "the first two levels of the self - dual sector , as well as the first levels of the @xmath113 other , non- selfdual sectors are degenerate .",
    "thus the first order nature of the transition is manifested by a level crossing in the self - dual sector .",
    "( for finite rings one observes a hybridization gap in the selfdual sector , which vanishes exponentially with the size of the system@xcite . )",
    "as shown by numerical calculations@xcite the same type of level crossing phenomena takes place for the higher lying levels , too .",
    "thus , for finite systems , the spectrum at the transition point is expected to decompose into two parts , which are going to be degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our numerical results on the multispin coupling model are in agreement with the above picture , thus we expect a similar scenario .",
    "the selfdual symmetry at the transition point , which is connected to a level crossing in the selfdual sector in the thermodynamic limit is responsible for the unusual spectral properties of the multispin coupling models for @xmath2 . the @xmath14 model , in which the transition is expected to be second order , is assumed to represent the border limit of continuous models .",
    "thus one expects that the above scenario , which stays valid as @xmath114 , could hold also for @xmath14 , perhaps with another type of functional form for the size dependence of the hybridization gap .",
    "indeed , this type of behavior has been found by our numerical studies .",
    "finally , we turn to discuss possible integrability of the multispin coupling model in eq .",
    "( [ e : hamilton ] ) . as a result of our numerical studies of spectral properties of the model",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence in favor of integrability of the hamiltonian in ( eq .  [ e : hamilton ] ) for @xmath4 , even at the transition point .",
    "this study were partially performed during our visits in budapest and grenoble , respectively , which was subsidized by an exchange grant of the rseau formation - recherches france - hongrie ( ministre de leducation suprieure et de la recherche ) .",
    "f.  i.s work has been supported by the hungarian national research fund under grants no otka to12830 and otka to23642 and by the minister of education under grant no . 0765/1997 .",
    "we have observed sharp peaks in @xmath103 at some specific values of @xmath92 as a result of almost degenerate energy levels .",
    "we have got rid of this finite size effect by discarding the values of @xmath115 which are 100 times larger than the average value .",
    "this does not change the value of the asymmetry @xmath103 for the self - dual point @xmath105 since the increase at this point is not due to some - quasi degeneracy , but to the fact that almost all eigenvalues are clustered in pairs of close values .",
