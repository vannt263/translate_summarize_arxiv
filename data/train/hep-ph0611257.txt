    "in the minimal standard model ( sm ) , neutrinos are massless",
    ". however , small nonzero neutrino masses are required by the atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments .",
    "a natural explanation for such tiny neutrino masses in the sm comes from an effective dimension-5 operator  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the usual left - handed lepton doublets transforming as @xmath3 under the standard electroweak @xmath4 gauge group and @xmath5 is the usual higgs doublet of the sm .",
    "there are three realizations of this operator  @xcite , the most popular one being the canonical seesaw  @xcite mechanism which adds three singlet heavy neutral fermions @xmath6 to the sm lagrangian .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is then given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9 dirac mass matrix linking @xmath10 with @xmath11 through the yukawa interactions @xmath12 .",
    "the majorana masses of @xmath11 violate lepton number by two units .",
    "therefore , in the early universe , a net lepton asymmetry may be generated  @xcite through the out - of - equilibrium decay of the lightest @xmath11 ( call it @xmath13 ) .",
    "the generated lepton asymmetry then gets converted into a baryon asymmetry through the interactions of the sm sphalerons  @xcite which conserve @xmath14 , but violate @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are baryon and lepton number respectively .",
    "the existence of @xmath11 explains thus at the same time why both neutrino masses as well as the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) are nonzero and small .    in supersymmetric theories the reheating temperature ( @xmath18 ) following inflation is likely to be rather low  @xcite .",
    "although some models  @xcite may allow a higher reheating temperature , in the conventional models @xmath18 is bounded strongly from above by the possible overproduction of gravitinos . on the other hand , in the simplest version of the seesaw mechanism",
    "the condition for thermal leptogenesis requires that the mass @xmath19 of the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath13 should be much higher than @xmath18 , assuming that @xmath13 contributes to the left - handed neutrino masses dominantly .",
    "since inflation would erase any pre - existing lepton asymmetry , the asymmetry generated by @xmath13 after inflation would be highly suppressed by its small number density and hence this mechanism will fail to explain the bau .    to avoid this problem ,",
    "several ideas have been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "an attractive scenario is the extended seesaw mechanism  . in this paper",
    "we follow the same scheme and work with the canonical seesaw mechanism ( sm plus three @xmath11 ) in the next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , which has an extra singlet superfield @xmath20 . to distinguish @xmath11 from @xmath20 ,",
    "an exactly conserved @xmath0 discrete symmetry is imposed , corresponding to @xmath21 .",
    "we then add an extra heavy singlet superfield @xmath22 , together with a softly broken discrete symmetry @xmath23 , under which @xmath22 is odd and all others are even . as a result ,",
    "the production and decay channels of @xmath22 are different , and the out - of - equilibrium decay of @xmath22 can take place much below the mass scale of the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath13 .",
    "the lower bound on the mass scale of @xmath22 can then be compatible with the upper bound on the reheating temperature after inflation .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the canonical leptogenesis and briefly recall the davidson - ibarra ( di ) bound on the mass scale of @xmath13 . in section",
    "iii we discuss an extended seesaw model by introducing an additional heavy singlet fermion @xmath22 of mass less than that of @xmath13 . in section",
    "iv we discuss how the thermal - leptogenesis constraint on the mass scale of @xmath22 can be lowered in comparison with the mass scale of @xmath13 . in section v we solve the required boltzmann equations numerically and show how the low mass scale of @xmath22 is compatible with thermal leptogenesis . in section",
    "vi we state our conclusions .",
    "in canonical leptogenesis the lightest right - handed neutrino @xmath13 decays into either @xmath24 and @xmath25 , or @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus a cp asymmetry can be established from the interference of the tree - level amplitudes with the one - loop vertex  @xcite and self - energy corrections  @xcite .",
    "a net lepton asymmetry arises when the decay rate @xmath28 fails to compete with the expansion rate of the universe @xmath29 at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the effective neutrino mass parameter , @xmath32 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the mssm and @xmath33 gev .",
    "this means that a bound on @xmath34 may be established by first considering the out - of - equilibrium condition @xmath35 which gives @xmath36 however , for @xmath37 a reduced lepton asymmetry may still be generated , depending on the details of the boltzmann equations which quantify the deviation from equilibrium of the process in question .    assuming a normal mass hierarchy in the right handed neutrino mass spectrum the cp asymmetry @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 ^ 2}{(m_d^\\dagger m_d)_{11}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{epsilon_1}\\ ] ]    the baryon - to - photon ratio of number densities has been measured @xcite with precision , i.e. @xmath40 to get the correct value of @xmath41 , one needs @xmath38 to be of order @xmath42 to @xmath43 . however",
    ", using the di upper bound on the cp asymmetry parameter  @xcite |_1| [ cp - bound ] one can get a lower bound on the mass scale of the lightest right - handed neutrino as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm higgs and it is also assumed that the physical left handed neutrinos follow the normal mass hierarchy . since @xmath18 is not likely to exceed @xmath46 gev , this poses a problem for canonical leptogenesis . in order to overcome this problem we consider an extended seesaw model as follows .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite we proposed a singlet mechanism to overcome the di bound shown in eq .",
    "( [ di - bound ] ) .",
    "we now present a realistic model where this mechanism can be implemented .",
    "one more ingredient has been added to produce these singlet fields abundantly in a thermal bath .",
    "we start with the nmssm model , which includes a singlet superfield @xmath20 in addition to the usual particles of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . to implement the seesaw mechanism ,",
    "we also include three right - handed neutrinos @xmath6 .",
    "we then demonstrate how a minimal extension of this model may admit a very low scale of leptogenesis , thus overcoming the gravitino problem .",
    "we include another singlet superfield @xmath22 and impose a @xmath47 discrete symmetry . under @xmath0 ,",
    "the lepton superfields @xmath48 are odd , whereas the higgs superfields @xmath49 are even .",
    "this corresponds to having an exactly conserved lepton number @xmath21 , or the usual @xmath50parity of the mssm . under @xmath23",
    ", @xmath22 is odd and all others are even , but @xmath23 is allowed to be broken softly .",
    "the most general superpotential invariant under @xmath47 is then given by @xmath51 we do not discuss quarks nor other interactions of the nmssm , which have been studied elsewhere .",
    "we deal only with neutrino masses and leptogenesis .",
    "we now break @xmath23 softly and the only possible such term is @xmath52 i.e. exactly as required to implement the singlet mechanism of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this allows @xmath22 to mix with @xmath11 to form a @xmath53 mass matrix in the basis @xmath54 $ ] , i.e. @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and without loss of generality we choose @xmath57 to be diagonal with masses @xmath58 . for small @xmath59 as well as",
    "the usual seesaw assumption that the entries of @xmath60 are very small relative to @xmath61 , the heavy masses are roughly given by @xmath62 corresponding to the mass eigenstates @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65 the light neutrino mass matrix is then ( m_)_ij -_k ( m_d)_ik ( m_k + ) ^-1 ( m_d)_kj .",
    "[ neutrino_mass ] in the limit @xmath66 we recover the neutrino masses as in the canonical seesaw mechanism .",
    "we assume thus @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the following .",
    "in this model , the addition of @xmath22 allows the choice @xmath70 .",
    "the induced couplings of @xmath22 to leptons are suppressed by factors of @xmath71 compared to those of @xmath11 .",
    "the decay rate of @xmath22 is thus given by _",
    "d^s = m_s _ i , [ gamma_d ] where we have assumed @xmath72 and the effective neutrino mass parameter is defined as _ i=. [ effective - mass ] assuming that @xmath73 and @xmath74 the above eq .",
    "( [ gamma_d ] ) can be rewritten as _",
    "d^s m_s _ 3 m_3 ( d_3/m_3)^2 .",
    "[ final_gamma ] the out - of - equilibrium condition @xmath75 is thus suppressed by a factor @xmath76 in comparison to @xmath77 and hence can be satisfied at a lower mass depending on the value of @xmath78 . the value of @xmath79 , @xmath34 and @xmath80 can be approximately fixed from the low energy neutrino oscillation data .",
    "so , the remaining free parameters are @xmath78 and @xmath69 on which the suppression factor @xmath81 depends .",
    "1.25 in -.95 in    -.5 in    the cp asymmetry generated by the decays of @xmath22 comes from the interference of the tree - level and one - loop diagrams of fig .",

    "( [ suppression - factor ] ) .",
    "this is shown in section v by numerically solving the required boltzmann equations . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "( [ allowed_ms ] ) the value of @xmath69 can be lowered much less than the di bound on @xmath19 by an appropriate choice of @xmath78 .",
    "this is because the low values of @xmath69 are not restricted by the low energy neutrino oscillation data for @xmath86 as we have seen from eq .",
    "moreover the washout effects are suppressed for low values of @xmath87 .",
    "so , a successful lepton asymmetric universe before the electroweak phase transition can be created even for a tev scale of @xmath22 .",
    "in this model @xmath22 is produced through the decay of @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding yukawa coupling @xmath88 can be as large as of order unity .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 can be brought to thermal equilibrium through the scattering processes : @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "note that these processes never change the number density of @xmath22 , but they keep @xmath22 in kinetic equilibrium .",
    "the decay rate of @xmath20 can be given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the boost factor and @xmath94 .",
    "thus the inverse decay of @xmath20 is given by @xmath95 .",
    "once the @xmath22 particles are produced , they decay through the channel : @xmath96 as shown in fig .",
    "( [ lepfg ] ) which violates lepton number by two units .",
    "apart from that , the other process which depletes the number density of @xmath22 is @xmath97 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "( [ delta_l=1 ] ) .    the subsequent decay of @xmath22 , below its mass scale , then produces the required baryon asymmetry through the leptogenesis route .",
    "however , an exact lepton asymmetry can be estimated by solving the required boltzmann equations  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to define the boltzmann equations in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is called the comoving density of @xmath22 while @xmath101 is the density of net lepton in a comoving volume and s = g _ * t^3 [ entropy ] is the entropy density .",

    "( [ gamma_s ] ) and ( [ washout ] ) the @xmath108 s are defined as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the scattering density .",

    "( [ washoutfig ] ) .      in fig .",
    "( [ decay_fig ] ) we have plotted the decay and inverse decay of @xmath20 and @xmath22 against @xmath113 . it is shown that the inverse decay of @xmath114 is not sufficient to bring @xmath22 into thermal equilibrium even if the suppression factor @xmath78 is as large as @xmath115 gev .",
    "on the contrary , the decay rate of @xmath20 is sufficiently larger than the hubble expansion parameter .",
    "hence @xmath22 can be brought to thermal equilibrium through the scattering process involving @xmath20 as long as @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , at a temperature far above the mass scale of @xmath22 it is in thermal equilibrium and hence a net lepton asymmetry in the thermal plasma is zero . below the mass scale of @xmath22",
    "the lepton number violating processes go out of thermal equilibrium and thus produce a net lepton asymmetry dynamically .",
    "this is obtained by solving the boltzmann equations ( [ s - evolution ] ) and ( [ l - evolution ] ) .",

    "however , the value of @xmath85 can not be made indefinitely small . because a net @xmath17-asymmetry has to build up before the electroweak phase transition which is required to be converted to the @xmath16-asymmetry through the sphaleron transitions .",

    "this indicates that for @xmath124 gev , @xmath125 and @xmath69 can be readjusted among themselves so as to get the suppression factor @xmath85 ranging from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",

    "we accomplished the baryogenesis via leptogenesis from the decay of an additional singlet @xmath22 in a supersymmetric extended nmssm .",
    "the bound coming from the out - of - equilibrium condition could be evaded because the couplings of the singlets cancel out from the asymmetry , so the couplings could be small and can satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition even at low scales . in the simplest seesaw models the couplings of the lightest right - handed neutrino could not be lowered much because that will not enable the thermal production of these fields .",
