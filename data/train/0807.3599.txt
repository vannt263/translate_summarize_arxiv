    "a classical game @xcite can be considered an abstract mathematical entity that is connected to the physical world abbottshalizidavies in at least three recognizable ways : a ) it describes a strategic interaction among the participating players b ) it is implemented using a classical physical system that the players share to play the game c ) it is played in the presence of a referee who ensures that the participating players abide by its rules .",
    "quantum games @xcite-@xcite retain a ) and c ) but they are distinguished from the classical games in that the physical system used in the implementation of the game is quantum mechanical .",
    "this naturally gives rise to the central question for the area of quantum games : how quantum mechanical features of the shared physical system , used in the physical implementation of the game , express themselves in terms of the outcome / solution of the game ?",
    "for a faithful answer to this question it seems natural to establish , as the first step , a correspondence between the classical features , or classicality , of the shared physical system and the classical game and its particular outcome . establishing this correspondence",
    "paves the way for the next step asking what impact it will have on the outcome / solution of the game as the classical features of the shared physical system are replaced by quantum features .",
    "the physical system used in a two - party einstein - podolsky - rosen - bohm ( epr - bohm ) experiment epr , bell , bell(a),bell1,bell2,aspect , peres , cereceda , winsbergfine , fine is known to have genuinely quantum features .",
    "this naturally motivates the use of a two - party epr - bohm physical system to play a two - player quantum game .    motivated by developing this approach towards quantum games , we proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite a scheme to play quantum games using epr - bohm experiment .",
    "we reported that this scheme is able to construct genuine quantum games from quantum mechanical probabilities only @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished in the proposed scheme without referring to the quantum mechanical state vectors , and with little reliance on the mathematical tools of quantum mechanics .",
    "we proposed this scheme for quantum games in view of jarrett s position jarrett stating that the experimentally observed violations of bell inequalities in epr - bohm experiments are due to violations of the conjunction of two probabilistic constraints  locality and completeness .",
    "jarrett concluded @xcite that the predictions of quantum mechanics , in good agreement with the experimental results , satisfy locality , but violate completeness .",
    "winsberg and fine @xcite prefer the wording * *  * * _ _ factorizability _ _ * *  * * for jarrett s * *  * * _ completeness_. we adopted winsberg and fine s terminology in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as in this present paper . that is , the quantum features of epr - bohm experiments emerge for non - factorizable joint probabilities .    by constructing quantum games from unusual non - factorizable joint probabilities",
    "this scheme provides a unifying perspective for both quantum and classical games , and also presents a more easily accessible analysis of quantum games for researchers working outside the domain of quantum physics .",
    "this scheme was developed for quantum games @xcite and applied it to analyze the games @xcite of prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) , stag hunt , and chicken .",
    "for the pd game our analysis showed that , contrary to the widely held belief , no new solution that is different from the classical solution emerges when a quantum version of this game is constructed using an epr - bohm setting .",
    "however , within the same setting , for three - player pd iqbalcheonm , iqbalcheonabbott a new solution indeed emerges that is also found to be pareto - optimal @xcite .",
    "moreover , we showed that for the two - player quantum chicken game , new solution(s ) arise for two identified sets of quantum mechanical joint probabilities that maximally violate the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) sum of correlations @xcite .",
    "the classical game of pd has a unique nash equilibrium ( ne ) consisting of a pair of identical pure strategies  and , in the two - player case , its quantum version in the scheme using the epr - bohm setting , it does not generate a new outcome .",
    "this motivates us , in the present paper , to study a quantum version of a two - player game , within the same scheme , that has a unique mixed ne .",
    "the well - known game of matching pennies ( mp ) @xcite provides such an example .    using the scheme based on epr - bohm experiments to play this game , we find the impact on the solution of this game when the factorizability condition on joint probabilities is dropped , while the conditions describing normalization and locality are retained .    another motive behind investigating the mp game , played using the epr - bohm setting , is as follows .",
    "we notice that when multiple ne emerge in a classical game , the analysis of its quantum version generates a separate set of constraints on joint probabilities corresponding to that particular ne .",
    "these constraints ensure that the classical game and its particular outcome remains embedded within the quantum game . as the mp game has a unique mixed classical ne",
    ", it presents an ideal situation to study how dropping the factorizability condition on joint probabilities may change the outcome of the game .",
    "in the game of mp each of the two players , henceforth labelled as alice and bob , have a penny that each secretly flips to heads @xmath0 or tails @xmath1 .",
    "no communication takes place between bob and alice and they disclose their choices simultaneously to a referee , who organizes the game and ensures that its rules are respected by the participating players .",
    "if the referee finds that the pennies match ( both heads or both tails ) , he takes one dollar from bob and gives it to alice ( @xmath2 for alice , @xmath3 for bob ) . if the pennies do not match (",
    "one heads and one tails ) , the referee takes one dollar from alice and gives it to bob ( @xmath3 for alice , @xmath2 for bob ) .",
    "as one player s gain is exactly equal to the other player s loss , the game is zero - sum and is represented with the payoff matrix :    @xmath4    where we take @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that mp has no pure strategy nash equilibrium rasmusen and instead has a unique mixed strategy ne . for completeness of this paper",

    "ne the players payoffs work out as    @xmath24      the first step in our quantization scheme for the mp game consists of translating the game into a classical arrangement using a physical system that involves @xmath25 joint probabilities .",
    "the arrangement we use consists of two players sharing @xmath26 biased coins to play the game , assuming that the referee has the means to set constraints on their biases .",

    "s / he identifies @xmath28 to be alice s coins and @xmath29 to be bob s coins . in a run , the referee hands over the @xmath28 coins to alice and the @xmath30 coins bob .",
    "alice s and bob s strategies consist of choosing one coin out of the two that each player receives in a run .",

    "we now state that the statistical behavior of the @xmath26 biased coins , expressed over a large number of tosses , is described by :    @xmath36    where the @xmath0 state of a coin is denoted by @xmath2 and the @xmath37 state by @xmath3 .",

    "we have found that , in order to guarantee that factorizable joint probabilities result in the classical game , certain constraints , given in ( [ constraint on indepedent probs ] ) , need to be placed on the coin probabilities @xmath49 . this translation paves the way for introducing the quantum mechanical joint probabilities in the playing of this game , that may not be factorizable as they are for classical coins .",

    "was originally developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the quantum game using the epr - bohm setting involves ( refer to fig .",

    "alice and bob are located at some distance from each other and are unable to communicate between themselves .",
    "3 .   the players , however , can communicate about their actions , which they perform on their received halves , to the referee who organizes the game and ensures that the rules of the game are followed .",

    "6 .   after receiving information about the pair of directions , which the players have chosen in a particular run , the referee rotates stern - gerlach type detectors along the two chosen directions and performs a quantum measurement",
    "the outcome of the quantum measurement @xcite , on alice s side , and on bob s side of the stern - gerlach detectors , is either @xmath62 or @xmath3 .",
    "runs are repeated as the players receive a large number of halves in pairs , when each pair comes from the same source .",
    "the referee records the measurement outcomes for all runs , when in each run each player chooses one of the two directions . 10 .",
    "the referee defines a player s strategy , over a large number of runs , to be a linear combination ( with normalized and real coefficients ) of the two directions along which the measurement is performed .",
    "the referee has payoff relations that s / he makes public at the start of the game and announces rewards to the players after the completion of runs .",
    "the referee constructs these payoff relations in view of a ) the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) of the game being played , b ) the list of players choices of directions over several runs , and c ) the list of measurement outcomes that the referee prepares using his / her stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "the translated mp game , using @xmath26 biased coins , allows one to express players payoff relations in terms of the @xmath25 joint probabilities .",
    "the following section shows that the physical system in the epr - bohm experiments also involve @xmath25 joint probabilities , and thus the above translation provides the natural route for playing a quantum mp game .",
    "the payoff relations ( [ q payoffs ] ) are defined in view of the fact that the set of @xmath25 joint probabilities satisfy a number of constraints that are imposed by the requirements of a ) normalization , b ) locality , and c ) factorizability .    in order to better appreciate the quantum mechanical probabilities , we consider , for example , the situation when over all runs alice chooses @xmath52 and bob chooses @xmath48 .",
    "referee rotates stern - gerlach detectors along these two directions and then , for example , referring to ( [ table ] ) @xmath63 gives the probability of him / her obtaining @xmath3 along alice s @xmath52 direction and @xmath2 along bob s @xmath48 direction .",
    "normalization says that when , for example , alice chooses @xmath52 and bob chooses @xmath48 for all the runs , the only possible outcomes are @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "the same is true for other pure strategy pairs @xmath31 @xmath33 @xmath68 :    @xmath69      the @xmath25 joint probabilities satisfy another set of constraints that are obtained from the requirements stating that in a run :    \\a ) alice s outcome of @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( obtained along @xmath52 or @xmath44 ) is independent of whether bob chooses @xmath61 or @xmath48 in that run    \\b ) bob s outcome of @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( obtained along @xmath61 or @xmath70 ) is independent of whether alice chooses @xmath52 or @xmath44 in that run .    when translated in terms of joint probabilities , and referring to ( table ) , these requirements state that    @xmath71    quite often one finds in the literature the word ` locality ' to describe these constraints .",
    "as can be seen , the possibility , described in ( factorizability ) , of writing @xmath72 for @xmath73 in terms of @xmath74 $ ] also assumes locality .",
    "notice that for a factorizable set of joint probabilities ( [ factorizability ] ) the locality constraints ( [ locality constraints ] ) always hold .",

    "( factorizability,[rsrs ] ) and in the possibility of finding @xmath74 $ ] that allows this , it is assumed that joint probabilities satisfy the locality constraints ( [ locality constraints ] ) .",
    "we now refer to a result , reported by cereceda @xcite stating that , because of normalization ( [ normalization ] ) , half of the eqs .",
    "( locality constraints ) are redundant thus making eight among sixteen probabilities @xmath72 independent .",
    "cereceda has reported that a convenient solution of the system ( [ normalization ] , [ locality constraints ] ) , is the one for which the set of variables :    @xmath78    is expressed in terms of the remaining set of variables :    @xmath79    is given as    @xmath80    these relationships arise because the quantum mechanical joint probabilities fulfill both the normalization condition ( [ normalization ] ) as well as the locality constraints ( [ locality constraints ] ) .",
    "notice that using ( [ table ] ) the correlation @xmath81 , for example , can be found as    @xmath82    the correlations @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 can similarly be worked out .",
    "the chsh sum of correlations is then defined as    @xmath87    and the chsh inequality :    @xmath88    which holds for any theory of local hidden variables .",
    "cereceda has reported @xcite that there exist two sets of joint probabilities that maximally violate the quantum prediction of the clauser - holt - shimony - horne ( chsh ) sum of correlations .",
    "the first set is given as    @xmath89    whereas the second set is given as    @xmath90    where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are defined in ( [ first set of probabilities],[second set of probabilities ] ) .",
    "that is , these two sets provide the maximum absolute limit of @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",

    "the quantity @xmath95 is then equivalently expressed as    @xmath97    in the following , the epr setting , introduced in this section , is used to play the quantum version of the matching pennies game .",
    "essentially , our quantum mp game corresponds when the @xmath25 joint probabilities , that appear in the payoff relations ( [ q payoffs ] ) , are obtained using the epr - bohm setting , instead of using a large number of tosses performed on biased coins .",
    "the players payoff relations in the quantum mp  game , therefore , remain exactly the same as they are defined and made public by the referee in eq .",

    "( [ constraint on indepedent probs ] ) we recall that it expresses the constraints on the coin probabilities .",
    "we also notice that the factorizability , expressed by ( [ factorizability ] ) , permits one to write the coin probabilities in terms of joint probabilities :    @xmath98    which allows us to rewrite the constraints ( [ constraint on indepedent probs ] ) on coin probabilities as    @xmath99    this provides the the key for embedding the classical game within the quantum game .",
    "s / he makes prior ( experimental ) arrangements in the epr - bohm setup ensuring that the constraints ( [ constraint on joint probabilities ] ) on joint probabilities hold during the whole course of playing the game @xcite .",
    "when this is the case the classical game remains embedded within the corresponding quantum game in that the quantum game attains classical interpretation with the joint probabilities becoming factorizable .",
    "however , the joint probabilities that the epr - bohm setting can generate can also be non - factorizable .",
    "this permits playing a quantum game in which the constraints ( [ constraint on joint probabilities ] ) hold , while the factorizability condition on joint probabilities is dropped .",
    "we now look at how dropping the factorizability condition for joint probabilities affects the outcome of the game . with the constraints ( constraint on joint probabilities ) continuing to hold , the referee can then find a pair of ne strategies @xmath19 in the quantum game using the inequalities ( [ ne ] ) as usual .",
    "because of non - factorizable joint probabilities the strategy pair @xmath19 may be different from the one which comes out for factorizable joint probabilities .",
    "notice that the rewards at the ne are identical to the ones given in ( payoffs at the ne ) .",
    "that is , when the @xmath25 joint probabilities become factorizable , the ne and the players payoffs become identical to the ones obtained in the usual mixed strategy solution of the mp game . also , the @xmath25 joint probabilities , even when they are non - factorizable and , therefore , violate one or more of the set of eqs .",
    "( [ factorizability2 ] ) , will always satisfy the normalization constraints ( [ normalization ] ) as well as the locality constraints ( [ locality constraints ] ) .    to be consistent with the standard setting @xcite for playing a two - player two - strategy game ,",
    "the referee considers it reasonable to require that in the epr setting a player plays a pure strategy if s / he chooses the same direction over all the runs and that s / he plays a mixed strategy if s / he has a probability distribution with which s / he chooses between the two directions at her / his disposal . however , identifying pure and mixed strategies in such a way is not of much help as the payoff relations , which referee uses to reward the players , generate the classical mixed strategy game even when the players play ` pure strategies . '",
    "this , however , remains consistent with the known result in the area of quantum games stating that a pure product initial state leads to the classical mixed strategy game .",

    "@xcite , and that of the present paper , however , is that it shows that , along with the reported possibility of translating epr - bohm experiments as special games , one can in fact quantize any two - player game using the framework of epr - bohm experiments .",
    "secondly , that we can analyze our quantum game using the non - factorizable property of quantum mechanical joint probabilities .",
    "nonfactorizability is known @xcite to be a necessary but insufficient condition for the violation of bell s inequality , the chsh form of which we consider here .",
    "that is , a set of @xmath25  joint probabilities that violates bell s inequality will always be non - factorizable , whereas one can find a set of joint probabilities that is non - factorizable and still does not violate the chsh form of bell s inequality .",
    "this known result has the following implications when it is considered in our scheme for playing quantum games using epr - bohm experiments : as a new solution of the game , which emerges because of dropping the factorizability condition , the relevant joint probabilities may not violate the bell s inequality ( in its chsh form)only those outcomes of the quantum game are to be considered to have a _ bona fide _ quantum aspect @xcite for which the corresponding set of joint probabilities violates the chsh form of bell s inequality .",
    "the ne of the quantum game for which the bell s inequality is not violated will , therefore , have a pseudoclassical aspect .",
    "using bell s inequality one can identify the pseudoclassical domain from the quantum domain as follows . with the constraints ( [ constraint on joint probabilities ] ) the chsh inequality ( [ chsh ] ) using ( [ delta ] , p12&p15 ) reduces itself to @xmath130where @xmath131 .",
    "now , if a set of joint probabilities results in a ne in the quantum game and for this set we have @xmath130  then this ne has the pseudoclassical aspect .",
    "however , if for this set we have @xmath132  then it has a _ bona fide _ quantum aspect . note that in the quantum mp game the strategy pairs @xmath118and @xmath119  emerge as ne for the set ( [ first set ] ) .",
    "for these ne we obtain @xmath133 .",
    "similarly , the strategy pairs @xmath124and @xmath119  emerge as ne for the set ( [ first set ] ) and for these ne we obtain @xmath134 .",
    "these four  ne , therefore , have a _ bona fide _ quantum aspect .                                                                                                                here by quantum mechanical probabilities we mean the probabilities that are obtained from squaring the probability amplitudes .",
    "in this paper we do not consider the negative probabilities that are sometimes introduced to give another perspective on quantum phenomena .",
    "that is , in each run the referee s measurement generates one of the @xmath26 possible pairs @xmath135 @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where the first entry in a bracket is the measurement outcome along alice s chosen direction ( which is either @xmath52 or @xmath44 ) and , similarly , the second entry corresponds to bob s chosen direction ( which is either @xmath61 or @xmath48 ) ."
