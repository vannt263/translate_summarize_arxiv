    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies exhibit some of the most extreme properties known for disk galaxies .",
    "this class itself can be split into the group of disk dominated , late - type field galaxies with absolute magnitudes between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and central surface brightnesses @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath5 , and the much smaller group of giant lsb galaxies ( `` malin-1 cousins '' , sprayberry et al 1995 and knezek 1993 ) .",
    "judging from their morphology these latter galaxies have undergone an evolutionary history quite different from the late - type field lsb galaxies which we will consider in this paper .",
    "the extreme gas - richness ( mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ) and low metallicities ( mcgaugh 1994 ) of the late - type lsb galaxies indicate that they are quite unevolved .",
    "they have low mass surface densities and this has often been suggested as a possible cause for their slow evolution ( van der hulst et al .  1987 , mcgaugh 1992 , de blok & mcgaugh 1996 ) .",
    "detailed investigations of a small sample of lsb galaxies ( van der hulst et al .",
    "1993 ) show that their gas surface densities in general lie below the critical density needed for star formation , as derived by kennicutt ( 1989 ) .",
    "although this global threshold density should be considered as a boundary condition only ( local instabilities may still cause star formation ) , it nevertheless shows that conditions for star formation in lsb galaxies are not as favourable as in `` normal '' high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "this might simply be caused by the low densities , making dynamical timescales much longer , and therefore hampering the collapse of gas complexes into giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "the low metallicity may also make cooling of the interstellar medium ( ism ) more difficult , delaying the formation of gmcs .    to get a better handle on the properties of the cold , molecular component of the ism in lsb galaxies",
    ", one needs to observe indicators such as the co molecule .",
    "previous studies ( schombert et al . 1990 ) that have tried to detect co , have not succeeded to rather low limits .",
    "this either means that co does not work as a tracer in lsb galaxies  implying that large amounts of molecular hydrogen could still exist  or that lsb galaxies are deficient in their molecular component .",
    "the case of h@xmath6-poor galaxies is especially interesting : the conditions that can then be deduced for lsb galaxies , which have obviously formed stars , might help answer questions as : where and how do stars form in an environment poor in molecular gas ? is a small molecular component , even as an intermediate agent always needed ?",
    "are gmcs always needed for star formation ?    in this paper",
    "we will describe the results and implications of a few very deep pointed observations in the line of various galactic environments in lsb galaxies .",

    "many studies list the total h@xmath6 masses of galaxies and compare them with other properties . to be able to compare our results , which only give @xmath35 in a part of the galaxy , with these other studies we derive an upper limit on the total h@xmath6 mass in the following way : we compute the ratio between the area of the beam and the total area of the galaxy within ( 1 ) the hi radius ( radius where surface density reaches 1 @xmath43 pc@xmath5 ) and ( 2 ) the optical radius @xmath44 . by multiplying the upper limits from table  2 with this ratio we find the total h@xmath6 mass ( again within either the hi radius or the optical radius ) .",

    "we have therefore used the h@xmath6 mass from table  2 without changes .",
    "the non - detections of co can be taken at face - value to suggest that lsb galaxies are poor in h@xmath6 .",
    "there are , however , several factors which complicate this naive interpretation .",
    "the most important of these is the conversion factor @xmath49 which is used to convert the measured co brightness temperature into an h@xmath6 mass .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is uncertain and is inferred to have a large range .",
    "any interpretation of co measurements will thus depend on the assumed values of @xmath49 .    in the following sections we will first discuss our results in the light of other studies of the molecular gas in late type galaxies , then explore the implications of possible variations in the conversion factor @xmath49 with morphological type and metallicity and",
    "finally infer that the lsb galaxies of the kind considered are here significantly poorer in h@xmath6 than their hsb counterparts .",
    "as the ism in lsb galaxies has low metallicities ( mcgaugh 1994 ) we will compare our non - detections with observations of samples of other late - type , low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "one such sample is that of sage et al .",
    "( 1992 ) of dwarf irregulars and blue compact galaxies .",
    "one of their conclusions is that for the galaxies in their sample the co / ratio did not depend on metallicity .",
    "if this were also true for our lsb galaxies then we would have expected to detect co based on their masses .",
    "our results therefore appear inconsistent with a constant co / ratio .",
    "this should perhaps not be expected : dwarf irregulars and especially blue compact galaxies have appreciable star formation rates or are undergoing bursts and both also have high surface densities .",
    "lsb galaxies on the other hand have low current star formation rates and low surface densities .",
    "a better comparison sample therefore is perhaps the sample of magellanic irregular galaxies of hunter & sage ( 1993 ) .",
    "these observations also resulted in null - detections .",
    "based on this they suggest that molecular gas may be a transient phenomenon in dwarf galaxies , as a result of the low volume densities which supposedly are not high enough to sustain h@xmath6 . the low densities found in lsb galaxies ( de blok et al.1996 ) then suggest that similar reasoning can explain the apparent lack of co , and thus of h@xmath6 .",
    "it is of interest also to examine as a comparison sample the sample of late - type galaxies in the virgo cluster as described by kenney & young ( 1988 ) .",
    "they discuss several reasons why the co - poor but hi - rich galaxies in their sample are most likely also h@xmath6-poor .",
    "the lsb galaxies discussed here share some of the properties of the late - type virgo - spirals so this discussion is relevant for our results .",
    "the sample of virgo spirals shows a large range in co - surface brightness ( defined as @xmath50 ) with the most luminous galaxies having the highest values .",
    "kenney & young divide the group of galaxies with @xmath3 into two groups according to their hi - richness .",
    "the hi - rich galaxies turn out to be poor in co , while the hi - poor galaxies are rich in co. as they find no hi - rich galaxies that are also co - rich , they suggest that this indicates that the hi - rich galaxies do not contain much molecular gas .",
    "this might thus be a hint that the gas - rich late - type lsb galaxies are also poor in molecular gas .",
    "kenney & young also find a correlation between the amount of far infra - red ( fir ) emission ( arising from dust heated by starlight ) and the total amount of gas within the optical radius of a galaxy .",
    "actual fir measurements of lsb galaxies are to our knowledge not available ( none of the late - type lsb galaxies discussed here was found in the iras database ) , but we can use the work by bothun et al.(1989 ) to show that lsb galaxies must have fir luminosities of @xmath51 .",
    "comparison with the relation of kenney & young ( their fig .",
    "3d ) then implies that the amount of present in lsb galaxies ( a few times @xmath52 ) is ( more than ) enough to account for the total gas mass .",
    "this also is an indication that lsb galaxies do not contain large amounts of molecular gas .",
    "what conditions must a galaxy fulfill in order to be able to maintain large amounts of molecular gas ?",
    "first , the metallicity must be high enough to ensure sufficient amounts of dust .",
    "second , the total column density of gas must be large enough to shield h@xmath6 from dissociating radiation . measurements of colours , metallicities and hii region balmer decrements of late - type lsb galaxies all suggests a low dust content ( mcgaugh 1994 , van den hoek et al .",
    "observations of the ( de blok et al .",
    "1996 ) show low surface densities .",
    "lsb galaxies do not seem to obey the conditions necessary for h@xmath6 .    as the h@xmath6 formation rate",
    "is thought to be proportional to the number density of the dust , the low dust content and low dust - to - gas ratio , or alternatively the low metallicity , lower this rate and also lower the fraction of star - forming - cloud mass that is in molecular form .",
    "the low dust content may make the conversion from into h@xmath6 more difficult , as dust grains provide shielding from the interstellar radiation field .",
    "a larger column density of gas is thus needed to self - shield the h@xmath6 .",
    "the low densities and lack of dust found in lsb galaxies make it easier for uv photons to dissociate molecules , thus destroying h@xmath6 more easily .",
    "however , the same processes affect the co molecules even more .",
    "lower abundances of oxygen , and presumably carbon , in the gas means that the sizes of the clouds as traced by the co may be smaller than the underlying h@xmath6 clouds .",
    "the co emission will therefore be lower too .",
    "if a constant conversion factor is assumed , this then leads to an underestimate of the total amount of molecular hydrogen .",
    "this effect is dramatically illustrated by maloney & black ( 1988 ) using a model of the smc .",
    "a dust to gas ratio ( equivalent to metallicity ) 17 times smaller than that of the local solar neigbourhood yields an h@xmath6 peak abundance which is decreased by only 10% .",
    "the effect is much more dramatic for the co. whereas models for galactic gmcs show that 99% of the carbon is locked up in co , the gmcs in the smc contain only 1% of the carbon in the form of co. self - shielding is thus very important for the survival of co molecules in the interstellar uv radiation field .",
    "observations of molecular clouds in the smc ( rubio et al .",
    "1993 ) do indeed show this effect and the value found for @xmath49 from an analysis of virial masses of individual clouds is 4  20 times higher than the standard galactic value for clouds of 20  200 pc in size .",
    "similarly the co to h@xmath6 conversion factor can be very different in the low metallicity lsb galaxies .",
    "one should keep in mind that a different value of @xmath49 _ does not imply that lsb galaxies contain large amounts of h@xmath6 .",
    "_ it still leaves open the possibility that the absolute amount of h@xmath6 may be fairly small .",
    "we therefore discuss various approaches to the conversion factor and the implications for the h@xmath6 content of lsb galaxies in the following subsections ( 4.2.1 - 3 )      young & knezek ( 1989 ) have analysed the change in @xmath53 over a large range in hubble type , and found a decreasing importance of h@xmath6 towards later hubble types . in this analysis they kept the conversion factor @xmath49 constant at @xmath54 cm@xmath5/(k km s@xmath29 , arguing that this trend can not be caused by a change in @xmath49 alone , as that would imply that the temperature of the gaseous ism would need to be some 20 times lower in late type galaxies than in early types , or alternatively the density of the gas would have to differ by a factor of 400 between early and late types .",
    "this means that the change in @xmath55 would have to be caused at least partly by a true decrease in the importance of h@xmath6 towards later types . again , if these arguments are accepted , lsb galaxies are galaxies that are poor in h@xmath6 , and whose gas component is totally dominated by the neutral hydrogen .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 , where the data of young & knezek is schematically represented , along with lsb measurements .",
    "the upper limits derived for the lsb galaxies clearly follow the trend defined by the hubble sequence . assuming a constant @xmath49 thus makes lsb galaxies 2 orders of magnitude more poor in h@xmath6 than early - type hsb galaxies and , based on our upper limits , a factor of @xmath56 poorer than hsb late - type galaxies of similar hubble type .",
    "low h@xmath6 fractions can also be inferred from the work of vila - costas & edmunds ( 1992 ) [ vce ] . amongst other things they looked at the mutual dependences in a number of hsb galaxies of metal abundances in the gas , surface densities of the gas and h@xmath6 fractions .",
    "the latter were determined from co fluxes from the literature , by assuming a variable conversion factor that would for each galaxy give an exponential total ( i.e.  and h@xmath6 ) gas distribution .",
    "they show that low gas - surface density galaxies have low oxygen abundances ( their fig .",
    "7 ) , and low h@xmath6 fractions .    in fig .",
    "3 the relation between abundance and molecular gas fraction from vce is shown , with our measurements and those from schombert et al .",
    "( 1990 ) overplotted .",
    "we did not include knezek s ( 1993 ) sample as this consists of giant lsb galaxies who have most likely undergone a different evolutionary history .    applying the abundance values from mcgaugh ( 1994 ) and de blok & van der hulst ( 1997 , paper i ) to the trend derived by vce we find that @xmath57 in lsb galaxies must be less than @xmath58 , consistent with the actual measurements , where our measurements imply ratios of less than 0.06 .",
    "the trend as presented in vce can not be explained as an artefact of their variable conversion factor @xmath49 .",
    "vce allow values between 0.8 and 4.8 ( @xmath59 ) , which is a factor of 6 .",
    "this translates in approximately a factor of 2 change in @xmath57 .",
    "the various values of @xmath49 which vce derive are however independent of properties like hubble type , and will therefore not introduce any _ systematic _ trends .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath49 in a non - systematic way as vce have done is therefore merely a shift in the positions of individual galaxies by at most a factor of 2 .",
    "in essence they have just added scatter to the relation derived by young & knezek ( 1989 ) .",
    "this therefore does not affect the conclusion that the vce analysis implies that the molecular component in lsb galaxies most likely constitutes only a small fraction of the total amount of gas .",
    "wilson ( 1995 ) demonstrated that maloney & black s ( 1988 ) ideas concerning a variation in @xmath49 with metallicity is borne out in observations of galaxies in the local group .",
    "based on measurements of the co luminosity and determination of the virial masses of individual clouds , wilson finds that the conversion factor increases as the metallicity decreases .",
    "israel ( 1997 ) investigated the metallicity dependence of @xmath49 in a different way using the fir surface brightness and column density to estimate the column density of h@xmath6 and found an even steeper relationship .",
    "the average oxygen abundance for the lsb galaxies we observed is 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath60 . using the above results this would lead to conversion factor values @xmath49 of 2  6 times the galactic value .",
    "the star formation rates and column densities in the galaxies used to derive the dependence of @xmath49 on metallicity are appreciably higher than those commonly found in lsb galaxies .",
    "the lower star formation rate implies a lower energy density of the radiation field and consequently lower dissociation of the co and h@xmath6",
    ". the result will be that @xmath49 probably is not as large as in the extreme case of the smc , so some care should be excercised in using these results for estimating the h@xmath6 mass limits for lsb galaxies .",
    "another effect of the low metallicities is a less efficient cooling of the ism , which leads to _ higher _ cloud temperatures , making it difficult for a cold molecular phase to exist .",
    "detailed modelling suggests that the lack of cooling is sufficient to prevent most of the gas from becoming cold ( @xmath61 ) ( see the results presented in gerritsen & de blok [ paper iii ] ) , and that this is one of the main causes for the low star formation rates in lsb galaxies .",
    "this implies that h@xmath6 would only be a small fraction of the total gas mass .",
    "bearing these effects in mind we estimate that @xmath49 will be @xmath62 times the galactic value in our objects . in other words , lsb galaxies should contain 4 times more h@xmath6 than the galactic value suggests .",
    "the trend found by young & knezek ( 1989 ) implies a decrease in the importance of molecular gas by a factor of 300 from early- to late - type galaxies .",
    "our lsb galaxies are furthermore at least a factor 10 more poor in molecular gas than average late - type hsb galaxies .    assuming that the galactic value of @xmath49 holds for the early - type galaxies , the metallicity dependence of @xmath49 increases the upper limits for the amount of molecular gas inferred in lsb galaxies by a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "this still makes lsb galaxies a factor @xmath63 more poor in molecular gas than the early - types .",
    "the metallicity dependence of @xmath49 implies that its value for the late - type hsb galaxies will also be larger .",
    "this means that the amount of molecular gas in lsb galaxies will increase by _",
    "less than _ a factor of @xmath64 with respect to the late - type hsb galaxies , thus retaining the difference between lsb and hsb galaxies .",
    "if , as suggested by , amongst others , israel ( 1997 ) the value of @xmath49 depends mainly on the radiation field , rather than metallicity , then the value of @xmath49 in late - type hsb galaxies could actually be @xmath65 than in the lsb galaxies , thus increasing the difference between hsb and lsb galaxies .",
    "similar arguments apply to the vce results .",
    "the larger @xmath49 will decrease the slope of the vce trend by about a factor of 3 , which is however not enough to make the trend of decreasing h@xmath6 fraction with decreasing abundance disappear .    in summary , the metallicity dependence of @xmath49 tends to offset partly the trends found by young & knezek ( 1989 ) and vce , but the effect is not strong enough to make these trends disappear .",
    "the trend of decreasing molecular gas content with hubble type remains , although slightly less steep than given by young & knezek .",
    "the conclusion remains that it is likely that lsb galaxies have smaller h@xmath6 fractions than their hsb counterparts .",
    "an additional argument why it is plausible to have small h@xmath6 fractions in lsb galaxies is the role of shear .",
    "one way of creating high column density regions where molecular gas may form is by making massive clouds .",
    "these form most likely in cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "the collision rate will be larger in galaxies where shear plays an important role .",
    "clouds may then also grow from gravitational accretion in shearing gas layers .",
    "the rotation curves of lsb galaxies show them to have only slowly rising rotation curves with large solid - body parts , so that the amount of shear will be smaller with a consequently smaller cloud growth rate .",
    "the cloud formation rate also depends on the mean gas volume density .",
    "for example in our milky way at 4 kpc 70 percent of the molecular gas is locked up in massive clouds , while at 10 kpc this is only 10 percent ( see e.g. sakamoto et al .",
    "it will be clear that the conditions for forming massive clouds will be less favourable in lsb galaxies .",
    "these arguments thus imply that lsb galaxies probably have a low h@xmath6 content .",
    "we should note though that co emission has been detected in a few lsb galaxies in the sample of knezek ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , as noted earlier , her sample was selected to contain giant early - type lsb galaxies .",
    "these galaxies have a much different morphology ( e.g. presence of a large bulge ) than the galaxies in our sample .",
    "a detailed discussion of these galaxies would be interesting but is unfortunately beyond the scope of this paper .      throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed a one - to - one correspondence between the co(2 - 1 ) brightness temperature and the co(1 - 0 ) brightness temperature .",
    "all derivations of @xmath49 etc . are based on the latter . in practice",
    "the correspondence is not entirely one - to - one , as the co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) lines do not necessarily trace the same gas .",
    "co(2 - 1 ) probably traces slightly warmer and denser clouds .",
    "chiar et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find from observations of an ensemble of molecular clouds in the galactic plane that the average ratio between the co(2 - 1 ) and co(1 - 0 ) brightness temperatures @xmath66 is 0.8 .",
    "this implies that a conversion factor @xmath67 based on co(2 - 1 ) observations should be 20 percent larger than @xmath68 , which is the commonly used conversion factor .",
    "further independent modelling by kutner et al .",
    "( 1990 ) shows that the ratio @xmath66 depends on gas density , co abundance and temperature .",
    "they find that @xmath66 increases with decreasing co abundance .",
    "one might tentatively conclude from this that the @xmath66 ratio in lsb galaxies might be closer to unity than the value of 0.8 mentioned above .",
    "the results of rubio et al.(1993 ) for the smc indicate a @xmath66 ratio of 1.2 , supporting the idea that this ratio is at least unity for lsb galaxies . in the worst case assuming a",
    "one - to - one correspondence between co(2 - 1 ) and co(1 - 0 ) ( i.e. assuming that @xmath69 ) thus underestimates the derived lsb h@xmath6 masses by 20 percent .",
    "this is not enough to make lsb galaxies rich in h@xmath6 and does affect neither the discussion nor the results .",
    "we have presented deep , pointed @xmath0co(@xmath1 ) observations of three lsb galaxies .",
    "no co was found at any of the positions observed .",
    "this leads to a mean upper limit of the local @xmath70 , with individual values for the total @xmath71 ratio reaching less than 6% ( assuming a galactic value for the co to h@xmath6 conversion factor @xmath49 ) .",
    "it is , however , unlikely that the galactic conversion factor applies to lsb galaxies which have low metallicities and low dust content .",
    "in fact the value for @xmath49 is likely to be @xmath62 times higher .",
    "the h@xmath6 content would be correspondingly higher .",
    "our limits then imply that lsb galaxies roughly have ( less than ) 25% of their gass mass in the form of h@xmath6 .",
    "this is still lower than is found in hsb galaxies .",
    "the conclusion then is that there are no large amounts of h@xmath6 hidden in lsb galaxies .",
    "the low star formation rates measured in lsb galaxies can thus be explained by the virtual absence of a molecular component .",
    "star formation in lsb galaxies may thus proceed in a different way than in hsb galaxies . a detailed comparison between the properties of star forming regions in lsb and hsb galaxies may be a good way to put more constraints on the way stars form in environments that lack a cold component .",
    "the james clerk maxwell telescope is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the particle physics and astronomy research council of the united kingdom , the netherlands organisation for scientific research , and the national research council of canada .",
