    "let @xmath3 be a polynomial mapping . in this article we consider @xmath4 as a dynamical system , that is",
    ", we study the behavior of the sequence of iterates @xmath5 . a case of particular interest",
    "is when @xmath4 extends as a holomorphic endomorphism on @xmath6 . as a matter of expositional simplicity ,",
    "let us assume for the moment that this property holds .",
    "the _ fatou set _",
    "@xmath7 is classically defined as the largest open subset of @xmath6 in which the sequence of iterates is locally equicontinuous ( or _ normal _ , according to the usual terminology ) .",
    "its complement , the _ julia set _ , is where chaotic dynamics takes place .",
    "fatou component _ is a connected component of @xmath7 .",
    "when the dimension @xmath8 equals 1 , the non wandering domain theorem due to sullivan @xcite asserts that every fatou component is eventually periodic .",
    "this result is fundamental for at least two reasons .    *",
    "first , it opens the way to a complete description of the dynamics in the fatou set : the orbit of any point in the fatou set eventually lands in a ( super-)attracting basin , a parabolic basin or a rotation domain .",
    "* secondly , it introduced quasi - conformal mappings as a new tool in this research area , leading to many subsequent developments .",
    "there are many variants and generalizations of sullivan s theorem in several areas of one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "for instance it was shown by eremenko and lyubich @xcite and goldberg and keen @xcite that entire mappings with finitely many singular values have no wandering domains . on the other hand ,",
    "baker @xcite , prior to sullivan s result , gave the first example of an entire mapping with a wandering domain .",
    "simple explicit entire mappings with fatou components wandering to infinity were given in @xcite and @xcite , while more elaborate examples with varied dynamical behaviors were presented in @xcite .",
    "more recently , bishop @xcite constructed an example with a bounded singular set . in all cases , the orbit of the wandering domain is unbounded .    in the real setting",
    ", the question of ( non-)existence of wandering intervals has a long and rich history .",
    "it started with denjoy s theory of linearization of circle diffeomorphisms @xcite : a @xmath9-diffeomorphism of the circle with irrational rotation number has no wandering intervals ( hence it is linearizable ) , whereas this result breaks down for @xmath10 diffeomorphisms .",
    "more recent results include homeomorphisms with various degrees of regularity and flatness of critical points",
    ".    for interval maps , the non - existence of wandering intervals for unimodal maps with negative schwarzian was established by guckenheimer @xcite , and later extended to several classes of interval and circle maps in @xcite . in particular , the result of martens , de melo and van strien implies the non - existence of wandering intervals for polynomials on the real line .",
    "one difficulty is to define a notion of fatou set in this context .",
    "let us just note here that for a real polynomial , the fatou set as defined in @xcite contains the intersection of the complex fatou set with the real line but could _ a priori _ be larger .",
    "the problem was also studied in the non - archimedian setting , in particular in the work of benedetto @xcite and trucco @xcite .",
    "@xmath11    the question of the existence of wandering fatou components makes sense in higher dimension , and was put forward by many authors since the 1990 s ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "higher dimensional transcendental mappings with wandering domains can be constructed from one - dimensional examples by simply taking products .",
    "an example of a transcendental biholomorphic map in @xmath0 with a wandering fatou component oscillating to infinity was constructed by fornss and sibony in @xcite .    for higher dimensional polynomials and rational mappings ,",
    "it is widely acknowledged that quasi - conformal methods break down , so a direct approach to generalize sullivan s theorem fails . besides this observation , little",
    "was known about the problem so far .",
    "recently , m. lyubich suggested that polynomial skew products with wandering domains might be constructed by using parabolic implosion techniques .",
    "the idea was to combine slow convergence to an invariant fiber and parabolic transition in the fiber direction , to produce orbits shadowing those of a lavaurs map ( see below for a more precise description ) .    in this paper",
    ", we bring this idea to completion , thereby providing the first examples of higher dimensional polynomial mappings with wandering domains .",
    "there exists an endomorphism @xmath12 , induced by a polynomial skew - product mapping @xmath13 , possessing a wandering fatou component .",
    "let us point out that the orbits in these wandering domains are bounded .",
    "the approach is in fact essentially local .",
    "a more detailed statement is the following ( see below for the definition of lavaurs maps ) .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be polynomials of the form @xmath16 if the lavaurs map @xmath17 has an attracting fixed point , then the skew - product map @xmath13 defined by @xmath18 admits a wandering fatou component .",
    "notice that if @xmath19 and @xmath20 have the same degree , @xmath4 extends to a holomorphic self - map on @xmath1 .",
    "observe also that examples in arbitrary dimension @xmath21 may be obtained from this result by simply considering products mappings of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 admits a fixed fatou component .    before explaining what the lavaurs map is ,",
    "let us give some explicit examples satisfying the assumption of the main theorem .",

    "numerical experiments suggest that the value @xmath27 works ( see figure [ fig:0.95 ] on page ) .    in view of the results of @xcite cited above ,",
    "it is also of interest to look for real polynomial mappings with wandering fatou domains intersecting @xmath28 .",

    "numerical experiments suggest that the parameter @xmath32 satisfies this property .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon graphically in figure [ realwandering ] for the mapping  @xmath4 defined by @xmath33 the set of points @xmath34 with bounded orbit is contained in the rectangle @xmath35 . the topmost image in figure [ realwandering ] displays this set of points .",
    "the bottom right image is a zoom near the point @xmath36 .",
    "a wandering component is visible ( in green ) .",
    "the bottom left image displays the window @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; the orbit of a point @xmath39 contained in the wandering domain is indicated .",
    "the coordinate @xmath40 is close to @xmath41 and we plotted the first @xmath42 and the next @xmath43 iterates .",
    "the points are indicated in black except @xmath39 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are colored in red .",
    "these peculiar values are explained by the proof of the main theorem ( see proposition [ key ] below ) .",
    "@xmath11    using skew - products to construct new examples is natural as it allows to build on one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "this idea was already used several times in holomorphic dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) and beyond .",
    "fatou components of polynomial skew - products were studied in several earlier works .",
    "lilov showed in his thesis @xcite that skew - products do not have wandering components near a super - attracting invariant fiber .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the argument used in @xcite breaks down near an attracting fiber .",
    "the construction in @xcite uses a repelling fixed point in the invariant fiber with multiplier equal to the inverse of the multiplier of the attracting fiber .",
    "this resonance between multipliers induces a dynamical behavior that can not occur in one - dimensional dynamics .    in the same vein ,",
    "an invariant fiber at the center of a siegel disk was used in @xcite to construct a non - recurrent fatou component with limit set isomorphic to a punctured disk . in that construction",
    "the invariant fiber also contains a siegel disk , but with the opposite rotation number .",
    "we note that the construction presented in this paper uses an invariant parabolic fiber which again contains a parabolic point .",
    "@xmath11    to explain the notion of lavaurs map and the strategy of the proof , we need to recall some facts on parabolic dynamics ( see appendix [ app ] for more details ) .",
    "let @xmath19 be a polynomial of the form @xmath46 and denote by @xmath47 the parabolic basin of @xmath48 .",
    "it is known that there is an _ attracting fatou coordinate _",
    "@xmath49 which conjugates @xmath19 to the translation @xmath50 by @xmath51 : @xmath52 this fatou coordinate may be normalized by used in this normalization as well as in the next one is the branch defined in @xmath53 which vanishes at @xmath51 ] @xmath55 likewise , there is a _ repelling fatou parameterization _",

    "( semi-)parabolic implosion was recently studied in the context of dissipative polynomial automorphisms of @xmath0 by bedford , smillie and ueda @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us already point out that since our results do not fit into the classical framework , our treatment of parabolic implosion will be essentially self - contained .",
    "as it turns out , our computations bear some similarity with those of @xcite .",
    "we can now explain the strategy of the proof of the main theorem .",
    "let @xmath61 be the parabolic basin of @xmath48 under iteration of @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 converges to  0 like @xmath64 .",
    "we want to choose @xmath65 so that the first coordinate of  @xmath66 returns close to the attracting fixed point of @xmath59 infinitely many times .",
    "the proof is designed so that the return times are the integers @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",

    "our setting is slightly different since @xmath78 keeps decreasing along the orbit . indeed on the first",
    "coordinate we are taking the composition of @xmath70 transformations @xmath79 the main step of the proof of the main theorem consists in a detailed analysis of this perturbed situation .",
    "we show that the decay of @xmath80 is counterbalanced by taking _",
    "exactly _ one additional iterate of @xmath4 .",
    "the precise statement is the following .",
