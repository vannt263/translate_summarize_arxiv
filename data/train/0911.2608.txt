    "we show that this can actually be done in two different ways , both of which reduce to the same notion for links .",

    "we define analogous operations of fusion and fission for embedded graphs and we introduce an equivalence relation of cobordism by iterated application of these two operations . + the second possible definition of cobordism of embedded graphs is a surface ( meaning here 2-complex ) in @xmath0 $ ] with boundary the union of the given graphs . while for links , where cobordisms are realized by smooth surfaces , these can always be decomposed into a sequence of handle attachments , hence into a sequence of fusions and fissions , in the case of graphs not all cobordisms realized by 2-complexes can be decomposed as fusions and fissions , hence the two notions are no longer equivalent . the idea of categorification the jones polynomial is known by khovanov homology for links which is a new link invariant introduced by khovanov @xcite,@xcite",

    "this is based on a result of kauffman that constructs a topological invariant of embedded graphs in the 3-sphere by associating to such a graph a family of links and knots obtained using some local replacements at each vertex in the graph .",
    "he showed that it is a topological invariant by showing that the resulting knot and link types in the family thus constructed are invariant under a set of reidemeister moves for embedded graphs that determine the ambient isotopy class of the embedded graphs .",
