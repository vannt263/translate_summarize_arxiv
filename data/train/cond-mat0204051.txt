    "in the past decades , the vortex state of superconducting networks has been investigated by several groups using different imaging techniques ( scanning hall microscopy @xcite , scanning squid microscopy@xcite or bitter decoration @xcite ) .",
    "the vortex configuration was studied in square or triangular lattices as a function of the magnetic field . in superconducting arrays",
    "the relevant variable is the magnetic frustration , @xmath2 , which represents the vortex filling factor .",
    "@xmath2 is defined as @xmath0 with @xmath3 , the flux quantum , and @xmath4 , the magnetic flux per elementary plaquette .",
    "the vortex pattern reflects the spatial phase configuration of the superconducting order parameter resulting from the competition between the magnetic field and the underlying lattice @xcite . for rational frustration @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 integer numbers ,",
    "a commensurate ground state is generally expected as for example the checkerboard state which was imaged in square lattices at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to present the detailed results of a magnetic decoration experiment in a fully frustrated dice network .",
    "the unusual properties of the dice lattice were recently highlighted by the discovery of a peculiar destructive interference phenomenon occurring at @xmath1 for the electronic wave function in the tight - binding model@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was shown later to manifest itself as a broadening of the superconducting transition and a suppression of the critical current in the corresponding superconducting wire network@xcite .",
    "this observation was indicative of the absence of commensurate vortex state in the dice network , in contrast to the square network which was shown to exhibit a sharp critical current peak at @xmath1@xcite .",
    "we report here new careful decoration experiments on a series of high quality extended niobium dice networks under different magnetic fields .",
    "the analysis of the vortex correlation functions shows unambiguously that the vortex state is fully disordered at @xmath1 and confirms the results suggested by our preliminary experiments on small networks @xcite .",
    "the issue of the vortex configuration is of additional interest in the dice lattice as the vortices are located on the ( dual ) kagom lattice ( fig .",
    "[ kagome ] ) .",
    "since the vortex variable is binary , for @xmath2 smaller than 1 ( in each cell there is either one vortex ( @xmath8 ) or no vortex ( @xmath9 ) ) , we can view this problem as ising spins on the nodes of a kagom lattice .",
    "this general problem has been studied theoretically@xcite with first and second neighbour interaction .",
    "our vortex experiment is the first observation of binary variables on a the kagom lattice .",
    "the imaging was performed by the bitter magnetic decoration technique @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic contrast of vortices in superconducting wire networks@xcite is very weak , we used the so - called flux compression technique@xcite .",
    "the networks ( fig .",
    "[ pattern ] ) were made of niobium wires ( @xmath10 m long , @xmath11 nm wide ) patterned from a @xmath12 nm thick nb layer epitaxially grown on a sapphire substrate at 550@xmath13c .",
    "the patterning was achieved by reactive ion etching in @xmath14 through an aluminum mask prepared by _ e - beam _ lithography@xcite .",
    "only the first @xmath15 nm nb was removed , leaving unpatterned a @xmath16 nm thick niobium layer as a flux compression bottom layer .",
    "the total array size was @xmath17 m long and @xmath18 m wide .",
    "the networks contained about @xmath19 cells , with a wire width homogeneity better than @xmath20 .",
    "the elementary cell area in all networks is @xmath21m@xmath22 and the matching field ( @xmath23 ) was obtained for @xmath24 mt .",
    "the decoration cell was placed inside a double @xmath25-metal shield . before each",
    "run the magnetic field was calibrated using the magnetoresistance curve of a large sns josephson junction array .",
    "the flux accuracy is a few @xmath26 per cell .",
    "we always found the counted vortex density perfectly consistent with our field calibration .",
    "we first apply the magnetic field in the normal state at @xmath27 k. then the sample is slowly cooled down across the niobium transition temperature .",
    "vortices nucleate at the niobium superconducting transition temperature , @xmath28 k for our samples , and , because of the strong network pinning , their configuration freezes out as the temperature decreases a few mk below @xmath29@xcite .",
    "flux compression takes place at the superconducting transition ( @xmath30 k ) of the bottom layer when the network vortex loops convert into abrikosov vortices .",
    "once the temperature is stabilized at @xmath31 k , ni particles are flash - evaporated on the sample under a nominal residual helium pressure of @xmath32 mbar .",
    "the vortex positions are then registrated at room temperature using a scanning electron microscope ( cf fig .",
    "[ pattern ] ) .",
    "this `` one - shot '' technique allows us to image a wide region and collect statistical information on the position of vortices .",
    "in this section we compare the vortex structures at @xmath33 and at @xmath1 .",
    "the datas are extracted from the sem - micrographs and the vortex configuration is then regenerated on a computer . the pictures on fig .",
    "[ configtiers ] and [ configdemi ] are parts of the complete images .",
    "since the bravais cell is composed of three different plaquettes , we represent the vortices with three different colors ( blue , green , and red ) depending on where they are located . to obtain a quantitative information on the degree of disorder",
    ", we have calculated linear correlation functions between vortex variables in the three equivalent directions of the lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ kagome ] ) . by making distinction between thoses three directions , we keep information on the domain shapes , which would be lost on averaging over the three contributions .",
    "the vortex variables @xmath34 are equal to @xmath8 if a vortex is present in the @xmath35 cell and @xmath9 if not .",
    "the three correlation functions , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are defined as :    @xmath39    where the @xmath40 cell is the @xmath41-th neighbour of the @xmath35 cell in the @xmath42 , respectively @xmath43 or @xmath44 , direction ( see fig . [ kagome ] ) and @xmath45 is the mean product @xmath46 for each @xmath35 having at least one @xmath41-th neighbour in the @xmath42 ( respectively @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) direction .",
    "we first consider filling factor @xmath47 where a stable commensurate state is expected .",
    "indeed one can build a simple ordered configuration with 1 vortex every @xmath48 cells , i.e. one vortex per bravais cell .",
    "this ordered phase is three times degenerated due to the lattice symmetry . on fig .",
    "[ configtiers ] , we show two of those phases observed on two different runs performed at magnetic field @xmath49 mt . we have analyzed each time a zone of approximately @xmath50 cells at the network s center .",
    "the actual frustration , as determined from the observed number of vortices , is for the first run : @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ configtiers ] left ) .",
    "we observe a huge single domain extending over the whole picture .",
    "for the second run shown in fig .",
    "[ configtiers ] right , the actual frustration is @xmath52 .",
    "the observed effective domain size is approximately 10 cells .",
    "excess vortices seem to gather near the domains walls , as can also be noticed in the former case ( added vortices sit preferentially on the defect lines ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to the one observed in square arrays @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions for @xmath53 are shown on fig .",
    "[ corretiers ] .",
    "as can be seen , the correlation falls from @xmath54 at @xmath55 to approximately @xmath56 at @xmath57 in the three directions and this level of correlation is conserved beyond the 40-th neighbour .",
    "the extended ordered vortex state at @xmath33 , is similar to that observed in the square or triangular lattices with rationnal frustrations @xcite .",
    "this structure remains ordered even within a few percent of excess vortices but the domain size decreases .",
    "this indicates the robustness of the @xmath47-ordered state to extra vortices .",
    "in contrast , at half filling the vortex lattice is incommensurate with the dice lattice .",
    "one must consider two bravais cells .",
    "we performed three different experiments at @xmath1 .",
    "the number of investigated cells was approximately @xmath58 for each experiment .",
    "the measured frustration was @xmath59 around the ideal half filling .",
    "a part of two regenerate images is displayed on fig .",
    "[ configdemi ] .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath1 is a rational filling factor , we did not observe simple ordered phases in any of the three experiments .",
    "rather we observe strongly disordered states reminiscent of the incommensurate states occuring at irrational frustrations @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions ( see fig . [ corrdemi ] ) rapidly drops to approximately @xmath60 beyond @xmath61 .",
    "this residual correlation is a real effect , larger than the experimental uncertainties .",
    "it is due to differences in the probability of populating the three different sites in the bravais cell .",
    "it corresponds for this decoration experiment to a population ratio of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively for the different kind of sites .",
    "this difference could be due to some slight inhomogeneity in the network temperature during cooling or in the wire geometry@xcite .",
    "presently the origin of this small effect is not understood and remains an open problem . fitting the correlation function with an exponential function @xmath65",
    ", we get a correlation length @xmath66 for @xmath1 .",
    "we also imaged a vortex lattice at @xmath67 .",
    "we saw no ordered domains , but we could not make definitive conclusion on the @xmath68-state with this experiment .",
    "this small deviation from the exact @xmath69 indeed corresponds to @xmath70 of the vortex population and might change the configuration more efficiently than for a higher filling factor such as @xmath33 or @xmath1 . in the litterature ,",
    "no observation of ordered vortex state was ever reported in superconducting networks for such small filling factors .",
    "our observation of a very short correlation length at @xmath71 , is indicative of a strongly disordered state .",
    "this observation is consistent with previous transport measurements in superconducting al networks with the same lattice@xcite .",
    "a sharp peak was observed at @xmath33 , consistent with the strongly pinning commensurate state shown in fig .",
    "[ configtiers ] . on the other hand",
    "the suppression of critical current at @xmath1 was indicative of a weakening of the phase rigidity due to the localization of the superconducting wave function in the aharonov bohm cages@xcite .",
    "the absence of ordering is reminiscent of the problem of classical ising spins ( zero or one vortex per cell ) on the nodes of the kagom lattice@xcite .",
    "however , since the condition of nearest neighbour interaction which is central to the prediction of disordered state at all temperatures in the ising model , is presumably not fulfilled for array vortices one can not draw conclusions from this analogy .",
    "very recent theoretical studies of vortices in dice josephson junctions arrays have more relevance as they directly address this issue of vortex ordering .",
    "korshunov @xcite investigated the ground state of superconducting dice arrays with either cosine or quadratic dependence of the coupling energy upon the phase difference .",
    "he found a ground state made of an ordered configuration of vortex triads ( clusters of three adjacent vortices ) . because of the proliferation of zero - energy domain walls , the ground state entropy is large but it is not extensive , in contrast to the case of ising spins on a kagome lattice@xcite where an extensive entropy was found .",
    "therefore , in this model , the true ground state configuration for @xmath1 should be ordered .",
    "in contrast , the observed vortex correlation functions in our decoration experiments do not reveal any signature of order .",
    "also , the histogram of vortex cluster sizes shows no preferred occurrence of triads .",
    "we do not believe that the geometrical irregularities present in experimental sample@xcite are responsible for the observed disordered state .",
    "instead , we believe that it results from the combination of large thermal fluctuations and large entropy of low energy configurational states at the vortex freezing temperature@xcite . indeed , a large number of low energy vortex configurations are likely to exist in the dice lattice @xcite .",
    "however , their difference in energy is much less than the energy barrier for vortex motion which , in the wire network@xcite is mostly determined by the single wire length , independently of the network topology . on cooling down the vortex lattice",
    "may therefore be freezed out in a configuration different from the true ground state . a possible origin of the lack of ordering of the vortex lattice",
    "was recently pointed out by v. cataudella and r. fazio@xcite .",
    "their monte carlo simulations on the fully frustrated josephson junction dice array suggest the existence of a low temperature phase transition below which a glassy dynamics prevents the system to reach the true ground state conjectured in ref@xcite .",
    "this scenario is consistent with our observation but can not be tested in our strong vortex pinning wire network array .",
    "we performed magnetic imaging of the vortex configuration in nb dice networks under several magnetic fields .",
    "we focused our study on magnetic frustrations @xmath33 and @xmath1 .",
    "numerical calculations of the correlations on the observed vortex positions lead to a quantitative characterization of the degree of disorder .",
    "while a robust commensurate state is found at @xmath33 , we observe a strongly disordered vortex configuration at @xmath1 characterized by a vortex correlation length close to one cell size .",
    "it is worth noticing that this feature , particular to the dice lattice , appears here in a system with no geometrical disorder .",
    "the discrepancy with the korshunov prediction that the ground state is ordered suggests that the true ground state is not accessible in our experiment .",
    "further investigation of josephson junction arrays on a dice lattice by transport and high sensitive magnetic microscopy@xcite at much lower temperature are needed to reveal the true nature of the ground state .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with c.c .",
    "abilio , b. canals , b. douot , s.e .",
    "korshunov , m. feigelman , l. ioffe , p. martinoli , r. mosseri , r. fazio and j. vidal .",
    "discussions within the esf `` vortex matter program '' and the tmr network no .",
    "fmrx - ct97 - 0143 are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the _ e - beam _ lithography and the sem observations were carried out with cea - leti - plato organization teams and tools .                                        vortex pinning is strong in wire arrays@xcite due to the large energy barrier for vortex crossing a superconduction wire .",
    "this barrier is suppressed in the vicinity of @xmath29 when the superconducting coherence length which defines the vortex core size becomes of order of the wire length .",
    "the condition @xmath72 gives an indication of the onset of pinning by the wire array and determines the freezing temperature of the vortex lattice .",
    "it is reached at @xmath73 mk below @xmath29 .",
    "the _ e - beam _ lithography process may lead to some defects which are repeted in each cell of the network .",
    "for example we can not discard a few percent difference in the width of wires with different angles .",
    "the difference in the probability of populating the three different sites in the bravais cell might be due to such systematic defects ."
