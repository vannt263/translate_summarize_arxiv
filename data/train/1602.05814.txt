    "in hadron - hadron collisions , possible signals of multi parton interactions ( mpi ) , due to the interactions of at least two partons of each hadron , have been investigated for a long time @xcite .",
    "recently , thanks to the the possibilities offered by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , run 2 , a lot of attention on this subject has been paid @xcite . in the present talk , we focus our scrutiny on the simplest mpi process , double parton scattering ( dps ) .",
    "the cross section for this process , assuming factorization , depends on non - perturbative quantities , the so called double parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) , which describe the joint probability of finding two partons at a given transverse distance with given longitudinal momentum fractions .",
    "dpdfs are therefore related to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) nucleon structure @xcite and are non - perturbative quantities .",
    "tractable model calculations of the dpdfs have been proposed in the last few years ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular ,    in refs .",
    "@xcite , dpdfs have been evaluated by means of a light - front ( lf ) approach , which allows one to achieve a poincar covariant treatment and then to reproduce the essential dpdfs sum rules .",
    "let us stress that even if there are no clear data from which dpdfs can be extracted , a signature of dps has been observed and measured in several experiments @xcite .",
    "in particular the dps cross section is estimated through the so called `` effective cross section '' , @xmath0 and evaluated in model dependent ways . despite large error bars @xmath0",
    "is found to be constant w.r.t . the center - of - mass energy of the collision and the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the interacting partons . in order to calculate @xmath0 in our dynamical model ,",
    "a useful expression has been derived in ref .",
    "thanks to that study , @xmath0 can be be directly evaluated from the calculations of dpdfs . in particular , in @xcite and here , use has been made of the results discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which dpdfs have been estimated by means of a lf model . in the next sections the main results of the calculations of @xmath0 will be properly shown and described .",
    "in this section , starting from the phenomenological definition of @xmath0 , a direct relation between this quantity and standard parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and dpdfs will be shown .",
    "@xmath0 , is usually defined through a `` pocket formula '' when a dps process produces two final states @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite :    @xmath4    here , @xmath5 if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are identical and @xmath6 if they are different . in the numerator , @xmath7 is the differential cross section for the inclusive process @xmath8 and reads as follows :    @xmath9    where here @xmath10 is the standard single pdf , the indices read @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the factorization scale for the process @xmath13 . on the other hand side , the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ pocket ] ) is the differential double parton scattering cross section :    @xmath14    in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , @xmath15 , often called `` double generalized parton distributions '' ( @xmath16 , @xcite ) , depends on @xmath17 , the transverse momentum imbalance of the partons 1 and 2 .",
    "@xmath16 are the fourier transform of the dpdfs @xmath18 , which depend on @xmath19 , the transverse separation , in coordinate space , between two partons .",
    "@xmath18 represents the probability of finding parton pairs @xmath20 with longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath21 and transverse distance @xmath19 .",
    "this is the non - perturbative input describing soft - physics .",
    "let us point out the physical content of @xmath0 .",
    "( [ pocket ] ) , if the occurrence of the @xmath3 were not biased by that of the @xmath2 , instead of the ratio @xmath22 one would read @xmath23 , representing the probability to have @xmath3 once @xmath2 has taken place assuming rare hard multiple collisions . the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath24 measures",
    "therefore correlations between the interacting partons in the colliding proton .",
    "now a suitable expression of @xmath0 for microscopic calculations , in particular highlighting the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath0 , will be derived .",
    "first of all , let us assume that heavy quark flavors do not contribute in the process and the that elementary cross section , appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ s_single ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , is basically ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a universal function , and @xmath27 are color factors , with @xmath28 , which stay in the ratio @xmath29 .    at this point , inserting eqs .",
    "( [ s_single])-([4 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ pocket ] ) together with these assumptions , one finds the following formal expression of @xmath0 : @xmath30    as one can see , in the above equation , assuming a complete factorized ansatz for dpdfs in terms of standard pdfs , e.g. , @xmath31 , one obtains a constant value of @xmath0 w.r.t . to @xmath1 .",
    "this scenario is realized neglecting double parton correlations .",
    "this is the kind of condition often guessed for the extraction of @xmath0 from data since there is no experimental information on dpdfs .",
    "the problems related to the uncorrelated ansatz are discussed in a number of papers ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in particular , in the valence region we are interested here , this assumption is not supported by model calculations @xcite , due to the presence of double parton correlations . before describing our results , the present experimental scenario is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , where @xmath0 , measured by different experiments @xcite , which analyzed the latter quantity with different final states at different values of the center - of - mass energy , @xmath32 , has been plotted . as one can see",
    ", a constant value of @xmath0 could be consistent with the data within the large experimental errorbars , which could hide the fundamental information on the possible @xmath1-dependence .",
    "let us stress that such important dependence could open new ways to access the 3d nucleon structure @xcite .",
    "nowadays , fundamental information on the 3d structure of the nucleon , related to the transverse position of partons , is usually investigated thorough the study and the measurements of hard - exclusive processes such as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , which allows to access the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent developments ) .",
    "further information could be obtained via the investigation of dpdfs in its full @xmath1 dependence which can be extracted from @xmath0 in dps .",
    "let us remark that the information encoded in dpdfs are anyhow complementary to those provided by gpds in impact parameter space .",
    "in fact , the latter quantities are one - body densities describing the probability of finding a parton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath33 at a given transverse distance from the center of the target , while , dpdfs are two - body distributions related to the _ relative _ distance between two partons with given @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "the measurements of dps could access information on the average transverse distance of two fast or slow partons : a very interesting dynamical feature , not included in gpds .",
    "l0.3     dpdfs can not be easily evaluated within qcd while they can be estimated at a low energy scale , @xmath36 , using models , as extensively done for the pdfs ( e.g. ref .",
    "the results of these analyses should then be evolved using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in order to match data taken at an energy scale @xmath37 .",
    "dpdf evolution is discussed e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite . the analysis we are presenting makes use of the poincar covariant light - front model approach , allowing for a correct starting point for a precise pqcd evolution . thanks to this feature , our model calculations can be relevant for the analysis of high - energy data .",
    "the model , chosen in order to grasp the most relevant features of dpdfs , is the one presented and described in ref .",
    "@xcite , being already used for the studies of other different distributions ( see , e.g. ,    [ fig : fig2 ]    refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the explicit calculation of @xmath38 has been described in details in refs .",
    "in particular , let us point out that strong correlation effects are present at the scale of the model and still sizable , in the valence region , at the experimental scale , i.e. after pqcd evolution",
    ". at low values of @xmath33 , presently studied at the lhc , correlations become less relevant , although their effects are still important for the spin - dependent contributions to unpolarized proton scattering . in order to evaluate @xmath0 , the single and the double pdfs , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) have been calculated imposing a unique factorization scale @xmath39 ( as in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath40 is the hadronic scale , where only valence quarks are present . here and in ref .",
    "@xcite we focus our analysis on the kinematics of the old afs data @xcite , i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the average energy scale turns out to be @xmath43 gev@xmath44 .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown in fig .",
    "2 , at the scale of the model , @xmath45 gev@xmath44 , and after non - singlet evolution to @xmath46 ( details on the fixing of the hadronic scale and on the calculation of the qcd evolution can be found in ref .",
    "as one can see , a strong @xmath47 dependence has been found in this narrow kinematical range at both the experimental and the model scales .",
    "one should notice that the three old experimental extractions of @xmath0 @xcite , which include the valence region ( cf .",
    "1 ) , lie in the obtained range of values of @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "2 . let us remark two important issues on the pqcd evolution of dpdfs . in our approach",
    ", there is only evolution on @xmath47 , being the one on @xmath48 still an open challenge and , furthermore , since we are interested , for the moment being , on the valence region , only the homogenous part of the evolution equations has been taken into account in our calculation .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the average value of @xmath0 , @xmath49 mb , is in good agreement with the experimental data reported in fig . 1 .",
    "in the present work , a suitable expression of @xmath0 for microscopic calculations , in terms of dpdfs and standard pdfs , has been derived . in order to perform the calculation of @xmath0 ,",
    "use has been made of a relativistic poincar covariant quark model .",
    "in particular , our investigation predicts an @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 , whose values are consistent with data including the valence region .",
    "moreover , such dependence , found when a non singlet evolution of the valence distributions is performed , as well as when perturbatively generated gluons are included into the scheme , is a feature not easily read in the available data .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 in restricted @xmath1 ranges would lead , therefore , to a first signature of double parton correlations in the proton , a novel and interesting aspect of the 3d structure of the nucleon .",
