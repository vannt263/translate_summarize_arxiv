    "detection of gravitational waves is one of the greatest challenges in experimental and theoretical physics in this decade .",
    "several kilometer - size laser interferometers , such as tama  @xcite , the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite , and geo  @xcite are in operation now and virgo  @xcite will be in several years .",
    "in addition to these ground - based detectors , the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) with an arm length of @xmath2 has been proposed  @xcite , and is planned to start taking observations in @xmath3 .",
    "nonspherical stellar collapse is one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves for both ground - based detectors and space antennas .",
    "ground - based interferometric detectors have a good sensitivity in the frequency range between @xmath4 and 1 khz .",
    "thus , the stellar core collapse of a massive star to a neutron star  @xcite or a black hole  @xcite is one of the targets . according to @xcite , at the formation of a massive black hole , quasinormal modes of a black hole are excited and",
    "gravitational waves of high amplitude associated with the quasinormal modes are emitted .",
    "( see  @xcite for a review of black hole quasinormal modes . )",
    "the frequency of gravitational waves associated with the fundamental quadrupole quasinormal modes of rotating black holes is @xcite @xmath5 where the frequency is higher for more rapidly rotating black holes .",
    "equation ( [ eq1.1 ] ) indicates that formation of black holes of mass @xmath6 may be a promising source for laser - interferometric detectors .",
    "the frequency band of space antennas is between @xmath7 and @xmath8 hz  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the formation of supermassive black holes may be one of the most promising sources . although the actual scenarios by which supermassive black holes form are still uncertain , viable stellar dynamical and hydrodynamical routes leading to the formation of supermassive black holes have been proposed  @xcite . in typical hydrodynamical scenarios ,",
    "a supermassive gas cloud is built up from multiple collisions of stars or small gas clouds in stellar clusters to form a supermassive star .",
    "supermassive stars ultimately collapse to black holes following quasistationary cooling and contraction to the onset of radial instability  @xcite .",
    "such dynamical formation of supermassive black holes may be a strong gravitational wave source for lisa  @xcite .",
    "the most hopeful approach for the computation of gravitational waves from stellar collapse to a black hole is to numerically solve the fully nonlinear coupled equations of einstein and the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "there has been much progress in this field in the last few years  @xcite . however , it is not technically easy to compute gravitational waves with high precision in numerical relativity , since the amplitude of gravitational waves associated with the stellar collapse is not very large and as a result , they could be contaminated by numerical noises and/or gauge modes .",
    "to cross - check the numerical results and also to compute precise gravitational waveforms , it is desirable to have another method .    as an alternative approach ,",
    "linear perturbation theory has been developed  @xcite . in this approach , we decompose the fully nonlinear metric and matter field of slightly nonspherical profiles into a spherically symmetric dynamical field and linearized nonspherical perturbations . because of progress in numerical techniques and computational resources , einstein s equations in spherically symmetric spacetime can be now accurately computed at low computational cost .",
    "furthermore , due to the spherical symmetry of the background spacetime , the perturbations can be expanded in spherical harmonics .",
    "thus all the equations for gravitational waves reduce to two simple ( 1 + 1 ) wave equations of even and odd parities , which can be numerically solved with high precision .",
    "although this method is applicable only to slightly nonspherical problems , the gravitational waveforms of small amplitude associated with stellar collapse can be computed with high accuracy .",
    "the result is also useful for calibration of fully nonlinear numerical results .",
    "the history of progress in linear perturbation theory of a spherically symmetric spacetime is as follows .",
    "the first work in this field was done by regge and wheeler  @xcite and zerilli  @xcite .",
    "they derived the linear perturbation equations of odd parity  @xcite and of even parity  @xcite in schwarzschild background spacetime .",
    "subsequently , a gauge - invariant formalism of linear perturbations was developed by moncrief  @xcite . extending his work , cunningham , price , and moncrief",
    "@xcite derived perturbation equations on the oppenheimer - snyder solution for a collapsing uniform dust ball  @xcite , and computed gravitational waves emitted during the gravitational collapse of a dust ball to a black hole .",
    "gerlach and sengupta  @xcite subsequently developed a gauge - invariant formulation of the linear perturbation on general spherically symmetric spacetimes . using the gerlach - sengupta formalism , seidel and co - workers  @xcite computed gravitational radiation from stellar core collapses , focusing mainly on the waveforms associated with the formation of neutron stars .",
    "they numerically solved the spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic equations using the may - white scheme  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied scalar gravitational radiation from a collapsing homogeneous dust ball in scalar - tensor theories of gravity , using a similar method to that of cunningham , price , and moncrief  @xcite .",
    "iguchi , nakao , and harada  @xcite studied nonspherical perturbations of a collapsing inhomogeneous dust ball , which is described by the lematre - tolman - bondi solution  @xcite .",
    "recently , gundlach and martn - garca  @xcite have developed a covariant gauge - invariant formulation of nonspherical perturbations on spherically symmetric spacetimes with a perfect fluid , and derived coordinate - independent matching conditions for perturbations at the stellar surface .",
    "the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes have been often studied using a method developed by may and white  @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "spherically symmetric spacetimes are described in terms of the so - called misner and sharp coordinate system  @xcite , in which a spacelike comoving slicing and an orthogonal time coordinate are adopted .",
    "this formulation is robust for the simulation of oscillating spherical stars and stellar core collapse to neutron stars .",
    "however , it is not robust enough to carry out simulations for black hole formation , because the computation often crashes before all of the matter is swallowed into a black hole due to inappropriate choice of the slicing condition  , while the surface is swallowed by an event horizon at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the orthogonal time coordinate and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the initial central density and average density of the dust cloud at @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that the former can be earlier than the latter for the initial data with certain central concentration . ] .    to compute black hole formation ,",
    "a null formulation proposed by hernandez and misner is well suited  @xcite . in this formulation",
    ", spacetime is foliated by an outgoing null coordinate and thus the whole region outside the black hole horizon can be covered .",
    "the singularity avoidance of the null foliation is assured until the foliation reaches an event horizon if the cosmic censorship holds . using this formulation , miller and motta",
    "@xcite performed the numerical simulation of collapse to black hole formation .",
    "baumgarte , shapiro , and teukolsky  @xcite used this formulation to study neutrino emission in the delayed collapse of hot neutron stars to black holes .",
    "this formulation was also applied to the study of cosmic censorship  @xcite and the formation of primordial black holes  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also computed the spherical collapse of supermassive stars using an outgoing null coordinate but different radial coordinate , i.e. , bondi metric to study the neutrino emissivity during the collapse .",
    "in this paper , we present a new implementation in linearized einstein theory , in which spherical background spacetimes are computed with the hernandez - misner scheme , while nonspherical linear perturbations are treated using the single - null coordinate system . with the hernandez - misner scheme , it is possible to follow spherical stellar collapse to a black hole until almost all the matter has collapsed below the event horizon .",
    "the null coordinate system is well - suited for computation of gravitational waves emitted near the event horizon , which we want to study here . as a related work to the present treatment , siebel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented simulations of gravitational collapse of neutron stars to black holes and the computation of quasinormal ringing in the spherically symmetric einstein - fluid - klein - gordon system using an outgoing null coordinate without linear approximation .",

    "thus , the initial data set is given in the following manner .",
    "first we specify @xmath189 , and compute @xmath191 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) .",
    "then , we determine @xmath190 and @xmath192 by integrating eqs .",
    "( [ eq : evolvep ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) using the condition @xmath198 with the initial value @xmath199 and @xmath200 . here , we have to tune @xmath199 so that it matches the static exterior solution at the stellar surface .",
    "the matching is written as @xmath201\\frac{\\gamma+u}{r}\\bar{\\pi}-16\\pi\\bar{j}r=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath202 is abbreviated as @xmath203 .",
    "after this procedure , the multipole moment @xmath137 is determined by matching the interior solution with the exterior static solution  ( [ eq : exteriorstatic ] ) .",
    "then , using the moment @xmath137 , the initial data set for the exterior solution is provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : exteriorstatic ] ) .",
    "the effective potential term of the wave equation for @xmath114 is regular on the event horizon .",
    "however , it contains a term of the form `` zero divided by zero '' ( for @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 ) .",
    "this implies that it is not possible to numerically integrate the wave equation for @xmath114 on the null surfaces which are very close to the event horizon .",
    "to integrate the wave equations until the null surface reaches the event horizon , we use an extrapolation for the value of @xmath114 on the junction null surface in the neighborhood of the event horizon as @xmath207 where the value @xmath208 on the event horizon is estimated as @xmath209 @xmath210 and @xmath211 are the values for @xmath114 and @xmath22 on the junction null surface at the @xmath212th ( final ) time step in region ii and @xmath213 . to compute gravitational waves in region iii emitted in the neighborhood of the event horizon",
    ", this extrapolation is necessary and quite helpful .",
    "as the first test of the spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic code , we performed a simulation for the homogeneous dust collapse .",
    "the numerical solution can be compared with the oppenheimer - snyder solution  @xcite .",
    "we chose the total grid number as 500 in this test .",
    "as the initial condition , we set a momentarily static dust ball of uniform density and of radius @xmath214 . precisely speaking",
    ", the dust surface is maximally expanded on the initial null slice . in this case , the event horizon is located at @xmath215 , where @xmath83 denotes the proper time of an observer comoving with the stellar surface .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : oppenheimer_snyder ] we show the time evolution of the coordinate velocity profiles as a function of circumferential radius at selected time steps .",
    "the crosses denote the numerical results and the solid curves the exact solutions .",
    "the figure shows that the numerical results agree with the exact solutions within @xmath216 error .",
    "we also note that the computation can be continued until the null hypersurface reaches a surface very close to the event horizon .    to demonstrate that the code works well even in the presence of pressure",
    ", we carried out a long - term evolution of spherically symmetric stars in equilibrium . here , we adopt the polytropic equations of state as @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the specific internal energy , and @xmath219 an adiabatic constant , for which we choose as 2 and @xmath220 . with @xmath221 , moderately stiff equations of state for neutron stars are qualitatively approximated . with @xmath222 , the equation of state for supermassive stars of mass @xmath223 , in which the radiation pressure dominates over the gas pressure , is well approximated . according to  @xcite ,",
    "the equation of state for supermassive stars may be approximated by the polytropic equation of state with @xmath219 as @xmath224 thus , we adopt @xmath225 to model a supermassive star of mass @xmath226 .",
    "the equilibrium configurations are obtained by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation .    in fig .",
