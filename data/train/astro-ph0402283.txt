    "beginning of the project ( launched on 26 january 1978 ) , it was expected that the archival value of the data obtained with iue would be very high .",
    "this expectation has been borne out fully after 18.6 years of orbital operations ( on 30 september 1996 the science operations with the iue spacecraft were stopped ) .",
    "the average iue archive data retrieval rate , during the operational phase of the project , has been some 61,000 spectra per year .",
    "this compares to a new data access rate of 5,500 spectra per year . considering that the demand for observing time continued to exceed the available time by a factor of three until the end of science operations ,",
    "it is clear that the iue archive remains an important source of data .",

    "these transmitted an optical video image of the sky area around the target reflected off of the focal plane , to the controlling ground station .",
    "fes-1 was never used in operations .",
    "fes-2 was always used for fine guidance throughout the mission .",
    "it has also been important as a photometer to measure the optical brightness of the observed sources . in 1991 , scattered light entering the telescope required a revision of the guidance procedures and affected the photometric performance of the fes .",
    "the only serious problems encountered with iue during its operation stemmed from the failures of five of the six gyroscopes in its attitude control system ( in the years 1979 , 1982 , 1982 , 1985 , and 1996 ) . when the fourth gyroscope failed , iue continued operations thanks to an innovative reworking of its attitude control system by using the fine sun sensor as a gyro substitute .",
    "even with another gyroscope lost in the last year of operation , iue could still be stabilized in three - axes with a single gyroscope , by adding star - tracker measurements . during the unexpectedly long operation period of iue",
    ", its nasa operators at gsfc and esa personnel at vilspa devised work - around methods to operate , despite unexpectedly high levels of stray light , when a piece of thermal blanket or reflecting tape fluttered in front of the telescope aperture in 1991 .    until october 1995",
    ", iue was in continuous operation , controlled for 16 hours daily from gsfc and for the remaining eight hours from vilspa .",
    "after that , esa took on a major role to alleviate financial problems of the partners .",
    "the operational schemes were completely redesigned and an innovative control system was implemented . with these innovations , it became feasible to perform science operations controlled only from vilspa .",
    "for practical reasons , only 16 hours were used for scientific operations , while the eight hours in the low - quality ( high radiation background ) part of the orbit were used for spacecraft housekeeping . in february 1996",
    ", esa decided to discontinue the satellite operations .",
    "iue remained operational until 30 september 1996 , when its remaining hydrazine fuel was deliberately vented , its batteries were drained , and its transmitter was turned off .      the stability of the iue instrument , and the care taken to ensure a proper calibration throughout the mission , make the iue database a very valuable archival resource for specific investigations in the domain of astronomical ultraviolet spectroscopy .",
    "the iue uniform low - dispersion archive ( ulda ) was the first attempt to put the results of iue at the disposition of the astronomical community in an orderly manner .",
    "version 3.0 of the ulda was released in september 1990 and contained 98.7% of all the low - resolution spectra obtained by iue before january 1 , 1989 ( @xmath144,000 spectra ) .",
    "the ulda was installed at a number of national hosts and was made available to general users from these hosts .",
    "the lasting value of the iue archive became even more evident after the final reprocessing of all the low - dispersion spectra into the final iue newly extracted spectral archive ( ines ) was completed .",
    "the reprocessing was done using improved extraction techniques and calibrations ( newsips : nichols 1993 ) .",
    "the iue final archive , another collaborative effort by nasa , esa , and pparc , was identified during the final phase of the mission as a necessary step in the production of a high - quality and uniform data base .",
    "this archive was seen as the final repository of the information collected by iue , produced at a stage when specialized knowledge of the instrument and of its calibration procedures were still available .",
    "the final archive will be maintained accessible to the scientific community as the historical reference of the iue mission and as a source of information for future studies based on iue uv spectra .",
    "it is a special tribute to the leadership of the iue project that most of the final archive production was done while the satellite was still in operation .",
    "the final version of the iue archive contains 104,471 spectra reprocessed with the most up - to - date calibration and includes high - resolution echelle spectra binned to the resolution of the low dispersion observations .",
    "the low - resolution version of the iue archive has been installed at the esa / inta ines primary center at vilspa / laeff and at 19 national or institutional hosts ( as of 18 february 2000 ) .",
    "although the iue data set does not represent a uniform survey of the sky , the large variety of objects observed by it offers unique opportunities to derive `` average '' properties of celestial populations .",
    "this has been used by many ( _ e.g. _ fanelli _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) to derive uv - to - optical color indices for various stellar spectral types and luminosity classes .",
    "these are later used to derive transformations , to create models of the uv sky ( brosch 1991 ) , or to determine the level of the diffuse uv background .",
    "observations of galaxies were used to determine average uv spectra of irregular , spiral , and elliptical galaxies , and of galactic bulges ( ellis 1982 , burstein _ et al .",

    "atlases of uv spectra of selected types of objects , based on iue data were published ( _ i.e. _ longo & capaccioli 1992 for normal galaxies , or courvoisier & paltani 1992 for active galaxies ) .",
    "apart from these special - purpose atlases , note those dedicated to the classification of stars from their uv spectra published by esa and by nasa ( heck 1984 ; wu 1991 ) .",
    "the ulda access guide no .",
    "3 ( longo & capaccioli 1992 ) included spectra obtained up to the 31st of december 1991 . the availability of the iue final archive , and of ines , along with the additional information collected until the cessation of iue observations on 30 september 1996 , were the reasons to compile a new collection of uv spectra of normal galaxies , obtained by the iue observatory .",
    "this collection is presented in this publication .",
    "we believe that its compilation will further enhance the lasting value of the iue observations .",
    "far uv radiation from galaxies was detected in the late sixties by space satellites such as the oao-2 and later the td-1 .",
    "it was the advent of the iue however , that provided a large number of spectra for many galaxies , of different morphological types , that confirmed and greatly expanded the earlier uv data .",
    "attempts to explain the uv emission from galaxies led to a flourishing of modeling work and to new views on star formation and chemical evolution . in spite of the enormous contribution of the iue experiment , the information about uv emission from galaxies is very sparse and the astronomical community still lacks a large sample of a few thousand galaxies with good uv information , from which to perform adequate statistical studies .",
    "this information is very important in order to understand evolution in the universe .",
    "significant information on selected objects , mainly on stellar populations and the nature of the ism , was obtained from the early iue spectra ( oconnell 1992 ) .",
    "similar observational data , combining uv with optical and near - ir spectrophotometry through matched apertures , were used to derive template spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for various types of galaxies ( storchi - bergmann _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; mcquade _ et al .",
    "a combination of iue observations and data from other uv imaging missions was used to extract `` total '' uv information on galaxies ( longo 1991 ; rifatto 1995a , 1995b ) .",
    "some of the latter information was included in the ulda guide to normal galaxies ( longo & capaccioli 1992 ) and in a comparison of galaxy properties in the uv using synthetic photometry from the iue spectra in seven photometric bands , five of which matched the ans bands ( longo 1991 ) .",
    "there is hope to derive the star - forming histories of galaxies through a combination of data from the uv to the near - ir , in the manner of the storchi - bergmann _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ; sb2 ) templates .",
    "the significant uv data collected by iue from normal galaxies is usually at @xmath21400 , except for the very young starburst galaxies and for some ellipticals .",
    "this spectral region , in late - type galaxies , contains mainly radiation from a - type stars and requires extrapolation of the stellar population to earlier types in order to account for lyman continuum photons . the flux below 1400 , observed in starburst galaxies , originates from stars earlier than type a , mainly b stars , although sometimes a contribution by field o - stars can not be ruled out ( brosch 1999 ) .",
    "some elliptical galaxies exhibit upturns of their spectral energy distributions below 2000 ( burstein 1988 ; bonatto 1996 ; oconnell 1999 ) .",
    "these are presumably produced by low - mass , helium - burning stars on the extreme horizontal - branch and in later stages of evolution .",
    "it is impractical to rely only on the detailed modeling of spectral features in the optical region in order to understand large populations of galaxies in terms of stellar populations and star - formation histories .",
    "one should combine information from many spectral bands , covering as wide a spectral region as possible . in the absence of very deep uv surveys in more than a single spectral band , such as those expected to result from the galex all - sky two - band uv survey ( bianchi & martin 1997 ) , our information about significant numbers of galaxies measured in the uv originates from the scap-2000 ( donas _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) , foca ( milliard _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , and faust ( deharveng 1994 ; bowyer 1995 ; brosch 1995 , 1997 , 1999 , _ et seq . _ ) measurements .",
    "these consist of integrated photometry at 1650 or 2000 of a few hundred galaxies .",
    "uv spectral information for about two dozen galaxies was also obtained by the astron observatory ( boyarchuk 1994 ) . in the 2000 band , and in the uv brightness range 16.5 - 18.5 , galaxies apparently dominate the source counts ( milliard _ et al .",
    "the corresponding blue magnitudes of these galaxies are b=1820 mag .",
    "and their typical color index is @xmath3\\approx-$]1.5 . comparing this color index with the template spectra of kinney _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , the foca - detected galaxies seem to fit the sb2 template , _",
    "i.e. , _ a slightly reddened starburst galaxy .",
    "the claim by the foca group of a large contribution of uv galaxies in deep - uv sky observations is supported by theoretical arguments requiring a fast - evolving population of perhaps dwarf galaxies for z=0.2 - 1.0 , in order to explain the faint source counts in other spectral domains ( ellis 1997 ) .",
    "the data sets provided by ines consist of low - resolution spectra extracted with an improved method from the line - by - line images of the iue final archive , and of high - resolution spectra resampled to the low - resolution wavelength step .",
    "the new extraction of the low - resolution spectra includes :    1 .   a better noise model ( schartel & rodriguez - pascual 1998 ) .",
    "2 .   a better spectral extraction procedure , resulting in improved extraction of spectra with lines and in a more adequate background estimation ( rodriguez - pascual 1998 ) .",
    "3 .   a better propagation of the quality flags , with a larger number of pixels flagged and more correct information about potential problems . 4 .",
    "a homogenized wavelength scale for the lw cameras .",
    "a major improvement in removing the contribution of stray light into the lwp camera in images obtained after 1991",
    ". 6 .   a revision of the flux density scale .    another important aspect of ines _ vs. _",
    "ulda is the presentation of spectra in standard fits format ; this implies that the spectra can easily be manipulated by the standard image - processing software packages in general use by the astronomical community .    the noise model used for the production of ines",
    "is derived empirically , from hundreds of flat - field images with different exposure times .",
    "this was required , given that the iue detectors are television - type and are different in their behavior from ccd detectors . an improved noise model for",
    "the iue spectra was a necessary first - step of an improved extraction procedure , because the determination of the spatial extent of the object spectrum in the cross - dispersion direction is based on the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio along the entrance aperture .",
    "also , the determination of the errors in the final extracted spectra is based on propagation of the errors from all the previous stages of the extraction .    the background determination for ines",
    "is performed by fits of chebyshev polynomials across the iue spectra external to the entrance aperture .",
    "the polynomial fit is assumed to be constant across the aperture .",
    "the extraction profile is determined by finding the extent of the spectrum through a spline fit along the spatial direction , for extents of s / n@xmath430 along the direction of the dispersion , and with a minimum of seven wavelength steps . in cases of weak spectra , where the s / n is below a certain threshold , the extraction is done by adding up all the flux within the entire aperture . in many instances relevant to galaxies , when the aperture is much larger than the dimensions of the target and the surface brightness is relatively low , this is the proper procedure .",
    "the accuracy of ines flux extraction has been tested by schartel & skillen ( 1998 ) and was found that , in general , newsips and ines gave consistent results .",
    "the definite advantage of ines was demonstrated for spectra with strong and narrow emission lines , where ines gave consistently more reliable results .",
    "in addition , the production of ines was done through a strict configuration control of all the re - processing stages .",
    "this resulted in improved quality control of the spectra and also of the information entered in the image headers .",
    "this included interactive verification of the input parameters against the hand - written observing logs , as well as automatic checks of the validity of values , correct sizes , and input formats of the raw images .",
    "the selection of objects to be included in this catalog is based primarily on the object classification included in the fits header of the object spectrum in ines and partly on object selection from the ines archive .",
    "the iue observing class is a two - digit code describing the observed target . in selecting the objects included here , we chose codes 80 ( spiral galaxy ) , 81 ( elliptical galaxy ) , 82 ( irregular galaxy ) , and 88 ( emission - line galaxy , non - seyfert ) .",
    "searches of the ines archive returned 370 objects corresponding to these definitions .",
    "further consideration of additional data about these 370 objects , mainly collected from the ned data base , indicated that some of them harbor active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "these objects may not have been known as agns at the time of the iue observations , or the guest observer ( go ) did not identify the object as an agn when the resident astronomer ( ra ) entered the necessary information in the exposure header .",
    "such objects were deleted from the candidate list .    on the other hand ,",
    "opposite cases of missed normal galaxies could exist .",
    "we did not search the more than 100,000 spectra on ines for objects classified by the go , and entered by the ra in the image header , as anything but classes 80 , 81 , 82 , or 88 , which may be `` normal galaxies '' as defined here . these objects are , therefore , excluded from this guide .",
    "another reason for rejecting candidates selected as normal galaxies were a few cases where an object was identified as a normal galaxy , had a spectrum present in the archive , but the extracted spectrum contained essentially no flux .",
    "in other cases , the location of the iue entrance aperture was patently off the object and sampled only clear sky , yielding a zero net - flux spectrum in ines .",
    "such cases were not included in our compilation , but have a remark in the appropriate section of the comments .",
    "the 274 galaxies included in the present guide are listed in table 1 .",
    "we present there the leading name of the galaxy as it appears in the homogeneous identification of iue , its j2000 equatorial coordinates , its morphological type and its t - type , its total b magnitude , and ( b  v ) and ( u  b ) colors , as listed in the leda database .",
    "given the large number of normal galaxies in the sample , we decided to present for each object the most relevant information on a single page of this guide .",
    "an individual page contains , therefore , the following information :    1 .   a header with the name of the galaxy as given in ines , its j2000 celestial coordinates ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , and its galactic coordinates ( l and b ) .",
    "2 .   a list of alternative names for the galaxy culled from leda .",
    "general information about the object , collected from the leda data base : morphological t - type , morphological type , redshift , and logarithmic size parameters d@xmath7 and r@xmath7 .",
    "information about the two iue spectra ( sw and lw ) presented on the page : image number , date when each spectrum was acquired , exposure of each spectrum in seconds , and position angle of the aperture s major axis .",
    "image numbers of at most ten additional iue spectra of the object . these are selected by decreasing order of exposure time .",
    "6 .   a plot of the combined uv spectrum of the galaxy , from 1150 to 3350 .",
    "note that the lw spectrum was , in some instances , scaled to match the long wavelength end of the sw spectrum , as explained below",
    ".   two images of the galaxy , extracted from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , with the overlaid outline of the iue aperture relevant for the specific spectrum displayed here .",
    "the left image is always that of the sw aperture position and the right image is that of the lw .",
    "the selection of spectra to be combined into the representative uv spectrum of the galaxy was done according to the following rules :    1 .",
    "two spectra , one sw and another lw , with the longest exposures , were selected from ines .",
    "the positions of the two iue entrance apertures , for the sw and lw spectra , were checked in the images with the aperture overlays . if the locations were very similar , the two spectra were retained and combined into the final representative spectrum .",
    "if not , ines was searched for a suitable pair of deep spectra conforming to the similar - location criterion .",
    "3 .   in a number of instances ,",
    "only sw or only lw spectra were available . in these cases ,",
    "the left or the right image of the galaxy , with the suitable aperture overlaid , is missing .",
    "the two selected sw and lw spectra were then combined into a single representative uv spectrum of the object . sometimes , the mean spectral energy density ( sed ) levels of the sw and lw spectra of the same object were very different from each other . a simple combination , _",
    "e.g. _ by concatenation of the sw and lw spectra would then result in a step - like sed .",
    "this is clearly visible in some of the spectra displayed in the ulda access guide no .",
    "3 ( longo & capaccioli 1992 ) , _ e.g.",
    "_ a1223 + 4846 .",
    "to prevent such an occurence , we decided to bring the lw spectrum to the level of the sw so as to ensure a smooth linkage between the spectra .",
    "we averaged the flux density in a 50 segment at the long wavelength end of the sw spectrum , and in a 50 segment at the short wavelength end of the lw spectrum .",
    "the normalization constant was determined from these flux density averages .",
    "the difference between the two averages was * added * to the lw spectrum to bring it into smooth continuation of the sw spectrum , and is indicated on the spectral plot .",
    "this matching was not performed in cases when it would have driven any part of the lw spectrum to negative flux levels .",
    "such cases can be noticed by the gap between the sw and lw spectra displayed on the relevant pages ( _ e.g. _ ic1613 ) .",
    "a marginal case , where the shift was from a spectrum at zero lw flux level , was for aoo anon1244 - 53 .",
    "in few a cases ( _ e.g. _ ngc 1147 ) the lw spectrum seems contaminated by additional light between 1900 and 2200 . in such cases ,",
    "no flux - matching procedure was applied .",
    "for some extended galaxies , much larger than the iue entrance apertures , spectra were obtained at a number of physically different regions in the galaxy .",
    "when two spectra , one sw and the other lw , could be identified in the same location for such a region , one page was dedicated to the separate presentation of this information .",
    "multiple pages are shown for the following galaxies : ngc 3034 , ngc 3690 , ngc 4449 , ngc 4861 , ngc 5236 .",
    "for some spectra , the aperture coordinates reported in the image header are incorrect and point to a region outside the target , while the spectra show a significant signal .",
    "for these spectra , a new aperture position was computed ( solano , e. , private communication ) based on the guide star position used by the guest observer .",
    "table 2 lists the image number and the revised aperture position .",
    "we emphasize here that the morphological type of an object included in this compilation is the one listed in leda . perusing the contents of this ines guide",
    ", we found that some objects with which we are familiar are obviously mis - classified in leda .",
    "such an example is mrk 49 , an e galaxy in leda but which is really a compact , starbursting dwarf .",
    "it is possible that there are more such mis - classifications , but we have not attempted to sort them out . along with the morphological type listed in table 1 , the numerical t - type associated with a galaxy should also change .",
    "we believe this change not to be significant when considering the statistical distribution of the normal galaxy population displayed here ( cf . , figure 3 ) .",
    "the most important difference between the two guides is inherent in our catalog being a later compilation , including all galaxies observed by iue that fulfill the selection criteria",
    ". the improved extraction procedures of ines resulted in much less noise in the spectrum of a galaxy , in comparison to the spectra presented by longo & capaccioli ( 1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , the method of combining the sw and lw spectra of one object is different ; we tried to match the blue end of the lw to the `` red '' end of the sw by averaging regions of overlap and adding a constant to the lw spectrum , thus the spectra we present are , by definition , smoothly joined .",
    "longo & capaccioli ( 1992 ) decided to correct the spectra they plotted in the ulda access guide no . 3 for galactic extinction .",
    "they used the burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) color excess and the seaton ( 1979 ) average extinction curve .",
    "it is obvious today that the galactic extinction is extremely patchy , even when using the improved extinction from schlegel ( 1998 ) ; we decided therefore not to correct the spectra for galactic extinction .",
    "the present guide contains 274 objects , approximately twice the number of galaxies included in the ulda guide of normal galaxies .",
    "therefore , it offers a much wider sample of objects for comparison than the previous publication . on the other hand , the same problem that plagued",
    "the derivation of template uv spectra of galaxies by storchi - bergman ( 1994 ) still remains ; in many cases the iue aperture samples only the innermost regions of galaxies .",
    "the catalog of normal galaxies here presented includes 274 galaxies distributed over the sky .",
    "the distribution is shown in figure 1 .",
    "this large collection of data , resulting from many individual research projects , does not constitute a homogeneous sample .",
    "the total b magnitude @xmath8 ( figure 2 ) spans a relative wide range ( from 6 to 19 mag ) , with a mean value of 12.5 and a peak between 13 - 15 mag , confirming that very few faint galaxies were observed by iue .",
    "the sample contains galaxies of all the morphological types , from ellipticals to irregulars ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the elliptical galaxies , some of which are intrinsically strong uv emitters due to the the uv - upturn phenomenon , represent about one - quarter of the total number of the galaxies in this sample .",
    "figure 3 shows the distribution of galaxies as a function of the continuous t - type morphological parameter .",
    "the objects were binned according to their morphological classes : e , e - s0 , s0 , s0a , sa , sab , sb , sbc , sc , scd , sd , sm , irr .",
    "the distribution of galaxies with redshift is shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is clear that iue observed normal galaxies only in the very nearby universe .",
    "many of the galaxies observed by iue are extended objects with respect to the large aperture of the spectrograh .",
    "the large iue apertures are 10``@xmath920 '' and oval - like , each corresponding to the area of a circular diaphragm having a diameter of 15.1 arcsec ( longo & capaccioli 1992 ) . in order to estimate the fraction of the galaxy area observed by iue , we calculated for each galaxy the `` coverage parameter '' c , defined as the logarithmic ratio between the surface area of the galaxy and the area of the large iue aperture .",
    "@xmath10\\ ] ]    here d@xmath7 and r@xmath7 are the major axis and the axial ratio of the optical image of the galaxy as listed in leda , in units of arcsec .",
    "the numerator approximates the surface area of the galaxy , represented as an ellipse with the major and minor axes of the galaxy .",
    "a c - value of zero implies that the entire galaxy was measured by in the iue spectrum .",
    "the distribution of galaxies as a function of the c parameter is shown in figure 5 .",
    "for 17 faint galaxies , where the axes are not measurable and which are not shown in figure 5 , the c parameter is @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath12 of the sample , the iue aperture covered less than the @xmath13 of the galaxy .",
    "figure 6 shows the number of available spectra per galaxy . for 40% of the galaxies included in this guide to normal galaxies only one spectrum , either sw or lw ,",
    "was obtained .",
    "a few galaxies were observed extensively . among those are the starburst galaxies ngc 4449 ,",
    "ngc 5253 , and ngc 5236 .",
    "figure 7 shows the number of galaxies in our sample as a function of the observation date of the two spectra included here .",
    "the distribution indicates two periods of enhanced interest in uv spectra of galaxies . from the launch of iue to the mid-80s there was presumably a learning period of uv properties of galaxies , when many objects were observed .",
    "after this , the exploitation of iue began in earnest .",
    "the peak in 1994 - 5 was probably due to `` last - minute '' observations , prior to the closing of the iue observatory .    in conclusion , the iue data set for normal galaxies represents mostly a sample of uv spectra of the innermost regions of bright nearby galaxies .",
    "in some cases , the coordinates listed for the entrance aperture do not correspond to the coordinates of the galaxy identified in the header as the target of the observation , and iue did not , in fact , observe an object but rather sampled blank parts of the sky .",
    "the galaxies for which the spectra are clearly misplaced , and which were removed from the present catalog , are : mcg + 06 - 20 - 0022 , ngc 3077 , ngc 5813 , aoo 1204 - 137 , aoo pks 1543 + 091 , aoo acg 1116 + 51 , and aoo pox 4 .",
    "for all the galaxies of the sample but six , the representative spectrum presented was obtained by the matching procedure of the sw and lw spectra ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the additive constant eventually applied to the lw spectrum is included on the right side of the plot .",
    "the lw spectra of five galaxies : ngc 147 , ngc 253 , aoo gh 10 - 4 , ngc 3642 , ngc 6062 , shows a rising trend toward short wavelengths ; it is possible that an additional light source contributed to the recorded spectrum .",
    "the lw spectrum for these galaxies is presented without performing the matching procedure .",
    "below we provide a few comments on individual objects and for the galaxies for which more than one page is presented :    aoo um 239 : this object was rejected from the list of galaxies included in this guide .",
    "the iue aperture is located on an object that is one arcmin south of the declination quoted by ned for aoo um 239 .",
    "ngc 221 : this companion of the andromeda galaxy , in the local group , is one of the most observed elliptical galaxies . the civ line is absent in the deepest   19@xmath14 34@xmath15.24 + 51@xmath16 30 11\".84 ( pmm usno - a2.0 ) .",
    "as explained above , this galaxy was excluded from our compilation .",
    "aoo 1214 - 277 and aoo 1214 - 28 : these targets are near the tololo 21 galaxy .",
    "the coordinates reported in the corresponding pages are those of some objects near the galaxy , listed in the pmm usno - a2.0 catalog .",
    "ngc 4449 : up to 48 spectra were obtained by iue for ngc 4449 .",
    "there are many hii regions and a complex of supernova remnants in this irregular galaxy .",
    "eight pages are shown here for ngc 4449 , representing the different regions sampled by iue .",
    "aoo anon 1244 - 53 : the level of the spectrum in the lw frame is consistent with a noisy zero signal .",
    "ngc 4861 : this system consists of ic 3961 plus a blue compact hii region in the south - west , identified as ngc 4861 .",
    "individual pages are shown for the two objects .",
    "aoo pox 120 : the declination quoted in leda is wrong . the coordinates listed here for this galaxy are from ned .",
    "ngc 5236 : this galaxy , better known as m83 , is a nearby bright starburst spiral .",
    "young massive star cluster systems are located in the nucleus and in the arms .",
    "many iue spectra were obtained at the position of some of the large number of historical supernovae observed in this galaxy .",
    "ngc 5253 : this nearby dwarf starburst galaxy hosts many bright knots embedded in its amorphous central region .",
    "it is believed that this complex of starburst regions is the source of the strong soft thermal x - ray emission detected by rosat .",
    "the representative spectrum is quite smooth , although the sw spectrum is saturated from 1800 to 1900 .",
    "ngc 5461 and ngc 5471 : these are two hii regions in the outskirts of m101 .",
    "aoo pks 1543 + 091 : the iue coordinates are wrong , and the spectrograph pointed at an unidentified faint object . the object is not included in our `` normal galaxies '' sample .",
    "eso b338-ig4 : this is a compact galaxy with double nuclei that was extensively studied by iue .    aoo am 2020 - 504 ; the declination listed in leda is wrong .",
    "the coordinates presented here for this galaxy are from ned .",
    "mcg-07 - 47 - 023 : the signal in the sw and lw spectra is consistent with a noisy zero signal .",
    "ngc 7673 : the coordinates of the lw frame are outside the object . the correct location of the aperture , calculated from the position of the guide star as stored in the header of this image , is still outside the galaxy .",
    "we present here a compilation of all galaxies classified as `` normal '' , _ i.e. _ not containing an agn , which were observed by the iue satellite .",
    "this is an updated and enlarged version of the previous iue ulda guide to normal galaxies , produced by longo & capaccioli , and supersedes it .",
    "we took advantage of the final processing of iue observations within the ines archive to extract all the observations of galaxies classified as normal and we present their uv spectra after matching the fluxes between the sw and lw segments that were observed toward the same location in the galaxy .",
    "we believe that although most iue observations of normal galaxies were only of their central regions , as defined by the optical light distributions , this compilation will be of some use in understanding the uv light produced by the different stellar populations in objects lacking a central , compact , massive object .",
    "this compilation was produced in support of the tauvex mission .",

    "<S> each representative spectrum of a galaxy consists of a short - wave ( sw ) and a long - wave ( lw ) iue low - dispersion spectrum ( where available ) combined into a single spectrum covering the wavelength range 1150 to 3350 . </S>",
    "<S> we selected the two spectra to be combined so as to be , preferably , the deepest exposures available in the ines archive . </S>",
    "<S> each representative spectrum is accompanied by two images of the galaxy , on which the locations of the sw entrance aperture and the lw entrance aperture are marked .    </S>",
