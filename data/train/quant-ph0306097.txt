    "squared modulus of the overlap between a pair of time evolving quantum states propagated by two slightly different hamiltonians , known as the fidelity or the quantum loschmidt echo , has recently attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "in addition to numerous numerical simulations , several theoretical results have been proposed to describe the fidelity decay in relation to the nature of the ( corresponding classical ) dynamics .",
    "jalabert and pastawski @xcite have related fidelity decay for coherent initial states at very short times , namely below or around the ehrenfest time @xmath7 , to the classical phase space stretching rate as characterized by the lyapunov exponents . in more general situations , and",
    "in particular for longer time scales , fidelity decay has been related to the integrated time correlation function of the perturbation through a kind of fluctuation - dissipation relationship @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "we have developed a general theory of fidelity decay based on a semiclassical treatment of this fluctuation - dissipation formula .",
    "it turns out that if the corresponding classical dynamics is fully chaotic then the decay of fidelity is , after a short @xmath8 ( ehrenfest ) timescale , independent of the structure of the initial state in accordance with the quantum ergodicity . on the contrary , if the corresponding classical dynamics is regular then the long time asymptotics sensitively depend on the structure of the initial state and range from a _",
    "gaussian _ fidelity decay for _ coherent initial states _ to a _ power - law _ fidelity decay for _ random initial states_. for regular classical dynamics",
    "the theory @xcite predicts _ faster _ decay of fidelity on a short time scale @xmath9 ( @xmath10strength of the perturbation ) , as the time correlation function of the perturbation observable does not decay , _ compared _ to the chaotic classical dynamics where the decay time scale is longer @xmath11 , and is longer the faster the decay of correlations we have .",
    "however , the fast  ballistic decay of fidelity in the case of regular classical dynamics described by the theory @xcite does not happen in one special but important case , namely when the time average of the perturbation ( _ i.e. _ the observable which perturbs the hamiltonian ) vanishes .",
    "classically , this means that the perturbation does not change the frequencies of the invariant ( kam ) tori in the leading order in @xmath3 , at least in the phase space region of interest .",
    "such a case of regular classical dynamics with vanishing time - averaged perturbation is the subject of the present paper .",
    "though this is not a generic case for a sufficiently large class of perturbations , it may emerge naturally if the system and the perturbation possess appropriate discrete or continuous symmetries .",
    "we will discuss general initial states , and specifically also coherent and random initial states .",
    "we find a very surprising result , namely that the quantum fidelity , after decaying for a short time ( e.g. following the classical fidelity @xcite for coherent initial states ) , _ freezes _ on a plateau of constant value .",
    "this is purely a quantum effect and has no analogue in the classical fidelity .",
    "the relative time span of the plateau is of the order of inverse perturbation strength @xmath12 and can be made arbitrary large for small perturbations .",
    "however for long times after the plateau ends , the fidelity displays a ballistic decay with the characteristic time scale @xmath13 , _",
    "e.g. _ gaussian for coherent initial states and power law @xmath14 for random initial states where @xmath15 is the number of freedoms .",
    "this ballistic decay can be explained semiclassically due to perturbative changes of the frequencies of invariant tori in the second order in @xmath3 . for coherent initial states in one dimension",
    "we find and explain another quite surprising general phenomenon , which we call ` the echo resonance ' where the fidelity displays sudden and significant revivals which can , under certain conditions , come back even to value @xmath16 .",
    "this happens at particular values of times , which depend on the derivative of the classical frequency with respect to the canonical action and do not depend on @xmath3 .    using the formalism of action - angle variables and its semiclassical quantization we derive explicit semiclassical formulae , in the leading order in @xmath4 , for the fidelity in all the regimes .",
    "our results are demonstrated with high precision by numerical experiments using a regular quantum top which is perturbed by periodic kicking .",
    "the quantum saturation of fidelity , which is a central result of this paper , may also be of some practical importance as it provides a mechanism for stabilizing the regular quantum dynamics .",
    "in section 2 we define the basic quantities and study the general properties of the so - called _ echo operator _ whose expectation value gives the fidelity .",
    "we propose a useful asymptotic ansatz for the echo operator , which is used later in section 3 , in combination with the semiclassical action - angle dynamics , to derive explicit general results on the echo operator and fidelity and to identify different regimes . in section 4",
    "we define a numerical model on which the results for two specific classes of initial states , namely coherent and random states , are later quantitatively validated in sections 5 and 6 , respectively . in section 7",
    "we discuss the general picture and summarize the results .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the _ unperturbed _ and the _ perturbed _ hamiltonian , respectively . in order to cover the even more general case of periodically time - dependent ( e.g. kicked ) systems , say of period @xmath19 , @xmath20 , we utilize our formalism in terms of the floquet map @xmath21^\\dagger$ ] , where @xmath22 denotes _ left - to - right _ time ordered product .",
    "dynamics is now generated by a discrete group @xmath23 , where an autonomous continuous time flow is approached in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "it seems convenient to postulate slightly different but completely general form of a _ small _ perturbation @xmath25 generated by a hermitean operator @xmath26 which in the leading order matches @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",

    "i.e. _ the norm of the exponential is small , @xmath147 , so we can use the second order expansion of ( [ eq : ferg1 ] ) which is precisely the linear response formula ( [ eq : lr2 ] ) .",
    "we have to compute the uncertainty of the time integrated perturbation operator @xmath110 . from semiclassical expression for @xmath110 ( [ eq",

    "thus the above expectation values should be _ time independent _ and equal to their time averages @xmath155 this gives us a prediction that , after following a classical decay up to the short time @xmath154 , the fidelity should reach a constant value  a plateau and stay there up to time @xmath132 .",
    "the linear response value of the fidelity at the plateau is @xmath156    further , we can easily go beyond the linear response approximation by expanding the formula ( [ eq : ferg1 ] ) to all orders in @xmath3 .",

    "therefore to remedy the random state formula for @xmath243 ( [ eq : plateaurs ] ) we simply replace an integral with the summation excluding the divergent terms , so the general final result reads @xmath427    again we find an excellent confirmation of our theoretical predictions in the numerical experiment . in the first calculations we choose the shift",
    "@xmath428 so that we have no singular frequency throughout the action space . in figure",
    "[ fig : shortran ] we demonstrate the plateau , which in the case of random states starts earlier than for coherent states , namely at @xmath429 .",
    "the value of the plateau can be calculated by numerically evaluating the integrals occurring in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lrrs ] ) , for the linear response approximation , or eq . ( [ eq : plateaurs ] ) in general .",
    "the integral over the angle @xmath430 in the formula for the plateau ( [ eq : plateaurs ] ) again gives a bessel function so that we end up with a numerical integration over @xmath320 @xmath431 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{eq : bessr}\\ ] ] observe that the random state plateau is just a square of the action - space average of a coherent state expression ( [ eq : plat ] ) .",
    "horizontal chain lines in figure [ fig : shortran ] correspond to this theoretical values and agree with the numerics , both for weak perturbation @xmath407 and strong perturbation @xmath223 ( inset ) .",
    "the plateau lasts up to @xmath132 which is for random states @xmath4-independent , @xmath291 .",
    "small resonances visible in the figures are due to the fact that the hamiltonian is a quadratic function of the action and therefore @xmath432 , so that the resonance condition ( [ eq : resonance ] ) is satisfied also for extended states ( [ eq : rescond ] ) . for a more generic hamiltonian these narrow resonant spikes will be absent . in figure .",
    "[ fig : shortransing ] we also demonstrate the plateau in the fidelity for the zero - shift case @xmath203 with a singular - frequency , @xmath433 , where we again find an excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction ( [ eq : plateaurs1 ] ) . in this case",
    "the theoretical value has been obtained by replacing an integral in ( [ eq : bessr ] ) with a sum over @xmath308 ( replacing @xmath434 ) and summing over all quantum numbers except @xmath435 .",
    "observe that the value of the plateau is much lower than in the case of a non - zero shift @xmath204 in figure [ fig : shortran ] .",
    ", for @xmath220 ( a ) , and @xmath221 ( b ) .",
    "here @xmath262 and averaging for @xmath220 , and @xmath221 , is performed over @xmath436 , and @xmath404 , initial random states , respectively .",
    "heavy chain line is the theoretical asymptotic decay ( [ eq : fergr ] ) with analytically computed prefactor ( no fitting parameters ) .",
    "the inset in the bottom figure shows the diffractive quotient between the numerical fidelity and the asymptotic formula ( [ eq : fsqrt ] ) ( chain line in the main figure ) . ]",
    "again , after sufficiently long time @xmath6 , the second term in bch expansion ( [ eq : bch1 ] ) will be dominating and we shall use the ensemble average of the asi formula ( [ eq : ferg2 ] ) where @xmath437 @xmath438 the semiclassical computation of such an integral is an elementary application of stationary phase method in @xmath15-dimensions , following @xcite for the analogous case of a generic observable .",
    "the condition for the validity of stationary phase method is that @xmath439 which will turn out to be consistent with the assumption @xmath387 .",
    "let @xmath440 be the @xmath441 points where the phase of the exponential on rhs of ( [ eq : fergr ] ) is stationary , @xmath442 .",
    "this yields a simple result @xmath443 where @xmath444 is a matrix of second derivatives at the stationary point @xmath445 , and @xmath446 where @xmath447 are numbers of positive / negative eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath448 .",
    "here we should remember that the asymptotic formula ( [ eq : fergr ] ) has been obtained as a stationary phase approximation of an integral in the limit of an infinite action space .",
    "if we have a finite region of the action space , the stationary phase approximation of ( [ eq : fergr ] ) gives additional oscillating prefactor , whose amplitude dies out as @xmath449 for @xmath215 and/or @xmath450 , and which can be interpreted as a _",
    "diffraction_. this oscillating prefactor can be seen in numerical data for fidelity in the inset of figure [ fig : longran ] .",
    "so we have found that , apart from possible oscillation due to phase differences if @xmath451 , the fidelity will for a random state asymptotically decrease with a power law @xmath452 note that for a random initial state , the actual transition time scale @xmath132 , as predicted by eq.([eq : t2 ] ) , indeed does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "the above theory is again quantitatively confirmed in figure [ fig : longran ] for the quantized top with @xmath453 , where a ( single ) stationary point needed for the formula ( [ eq : fsqrt ] ) had to be calculated numerically .",
    "in the present paper we have elaborated a semiclassical theory of quantum fidelity decay for systems with an integrable classical counterparts , perturbed by observables of vanishing time average .",
    "such perturbations may not be generic , but provide important special class of perturbations which are often enforced by symmetries .",
    "we have found that quantum fidelity will generally , after initial decay on a short perturbation independent timescale @xmath154 , exhibit a saturation around a constant value  the plateau , and stay there up to time @xmath132 , such that the time span of the plateau @xmath454 can be made arbitrary long for small perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "after the plateau , @xmath387 , the fidelity will decay as a gaussian for a coherent initial state , or as a power law @xmath14 for random initial states , just to name the two most important specific cases , where the timescale of decay is generally proportional to @xmath455 .",
    "this must be contrasted with the decay in the regular case of a non - zero time - average perturbation @xcite where the decay time scales with the perturbation strength as @xmath274 . in the case of localized initial wavepackets in one dimension ,",
    "we observe and explain the effect of echo resonances , _ i.e. _ the sudden revivals of fidelity at perturbation independent and equally spaced instants of time .",
    "the freezing of fidelity is a distinct quantum phenomenon , as the corresponding classical fidelity for the initial gaussian wavepacket displays a power - law decay @xmath14 @xcite after the point @xmath154 where the quantum plateau starts .",
    "the classical fidelity decays on a time scale @xmath274 no matter what the average value of the perturbation is , while the time scale of quantum fidelity decay drastically changes from @xmath274 to @xmath455 , having @xmath62 .",
    "this increased stability of regular quantum systems to perturbations with a zero time average could be potentially useful in constructing quantum devices @xcite .",
    "this is even more so because the plateau also exists for random initial states which are expected to be more relevant for efficient quantum information processing .",
