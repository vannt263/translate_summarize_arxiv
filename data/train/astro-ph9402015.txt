    "0.8 cm absorption - line features in the spectra of distant quasars arising from intervening damped ly@xmath0 systems are presently yielding extremely interesting information about the evolution of the gaseous content of the universe .",
    "surveys carried out at optical wavelengths indicate that the damped ly@xmath0 absorbers contribute a cosmological mass density roughly comparable to the density of luminous matter in present - day spiral galaxies ( wolfe et al .",
    "more recently , lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have analyzed a set of international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra in order to extend the search for damped ly@xmath0 absorption systems to lower redshifts .",
    "taken together , these surveys indicate that the cosmological mass density of neutral gas associated with damped ly@xmath0 absorption decreases significantly from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , and this evolution results from a steady decrease in the incidence of high column density absorption systems with decreasing redshift .",
    "the damped ly@xmath0 absorbers are prime candidates for the progenitors of spiral galaxies .",
    "detailed absorption - line modelling of individual damped ly@xmath0 absorption systems indicates a resemblance to extended hi disks ( wolfe et al .",
    "further evidence for the disk hypothesis has also come using a variety of other observational techniques .",
    "vlbi investigation of the @xmath7 21 cm line in the quasar pks0458 - 02 reveals that the absorber extends at least @xmath8 kpc transverse to the line of sight ( briggs et al .",
    "in addition , wolfe et al . (",
    "1992 ) have acquired deep ccd images of the field surrounding the qso h0836 + 113 and find a ly@xmath0 emitter corresponding to the z=2.466 damped ly@xmath0 line with linear dimensions @xmath9 kpc@xmath10 , comparable to the size of a present - day disk galaxy .    if the damped ly@xmath0 systems are indeed the progenitors of galactic disks , then the observed evolution of these systems with redshift places important constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation .",
    "most currently popular cosmological models , including cold dark matter ( cdm ) models and variations thereof , predict that structure forms in a hierarchical fashion , with small objects merging to form larger and larger structures .",
    "gas , which is trapped and heated within a collapsing dark matter halo , may then cool and collapse to form a rotationally supported disk at the centre of the halo .",
    "this picture has been investigated in a number of papers using analytic techniques based on the press - schechter formalism ( white & frenk 1991 ; lacey & silk 1991 ; kauffmann et al . 1993 ; lacey et al . 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "it has also been studied using numerical techniques such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) ( katz & gunn 1991 ; katz , hernquist & weinberg 1992 ; navarro & white 1994 ; evrard , summers & davis 1993 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the most recent data of lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1993 ) on the statistics of damped ly@xmath0 absorption systems to constrain cosmological models and the history of star formation in galaxies .",
    "we make use of the analytic formalism developed by kauffmann & white ( 1993 ) and kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to keep track of the cooling of gas and formation of stars in an evolving distribution of dark matter halos in a hierarchical universe .    in section 3",
    ", we show that the rapid increase in the cosmological mass density of neutral gas at high redshifts can not be accommodated in _ any _ model where stars form with the same efficiency at all epochs . in most studies of galaxy formation in a hierarchical universe",
    ", stars are assumed to form at a rate proportional to the amount of gas which cools at any given time .",
    "this leads to neutral gas mass densities that remain constant or even decrease at high redshift .",
    "we also show that a mixed dark matter ( mdm ) model with @xmath2 is not able to account for the large amounts of hi gas observed at high redshift in damped ly@xmath0 systems , simply because structure forms too late in this model . in section 4 , we construct a model in which the efficiency of star formation in the universe decreases as a power of the redshift @xmath11 , and we assume that gas cooling within a dark matter halo forms an exponential disk with a scale length proportional to the virial radius of the halo .",
    "we find that our model is in good agreement with the available observations .",
    "finally , we show that our empirically - derived star formation law leads to disk galaxies with spectral properties similar to those of present day spiral galaxies .",
    "the semianalytic model of galaxy formation that we use has been described in detail in a recent paper by kauffmann , white & guiderdoni ( 1993 , hereafter kwg ) .",
    "we will only present a brief summary of the model here .",
    "we use an extension of the press - schechter theory due to bower ( 1991 ) and bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to model the evolution of dark matter halos in a hierarchical universe .",
    "we construct monte carlo realizations of the merging history of a present - day dark matter halo of given mass .",
    "this allows us to trace the merging path of every halo mass element through all the progenitor halos from which the present object formed .    let us now consider a set of dark matter halos present in the universe at some redshift z. for simplicity , we model our halos as truncated , singular , isothermal spheres .",
    "we assume that when a halo forms , gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature of the halo and relaxes to a distribution that exactly parallels that of the dark matter .",
    "gas is then able to cool and collapse to form a galaxy at the centre of the halo . in the terminology adopted by kwg",
    ", this galaxy is referred to as the _ central _ galaxy of the halo .",
    "the rate at which cold gas settles onto the central galaxy of a halo of circular velocity @xmath12 is given by min@xmath13 .",
    "the infall rate @xmath14 onto the halo is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fraction of the critical density in the form of baryons and @xmath17 is the fraction of the baryons in the form of gas . in this paper , we adopt @xmath18 , which is the upper limit of values allowed by big bang nucleosynthesis if @xmath19 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( olive et al .",
    "the cooling rate @xmath20 can be expressed as a simple inflow equation , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radius at which the cooling time in the halo is equal to the age of the universe .",
    "it is not easy to predict exactly at what rate this cold gas will turn into stars .",
    "kwg choose a star formation law given by the simple equation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the total mass of cold gas , @xmath25 is a characteristic dynamical timescale for the galaxy , and @xmath0 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "similar star formation laws have also been adopted by other authors ( white & frenk 1991 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ) . for a standard scalo ( 1986 ) imf ,",
    "the number of supernovae expected per solar mass of stars formed is @xmath26 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the ejecta from each supernova , @xmath27 , is about 10@xmath28 ergs . if a fraction @xmath29 of this energy is used to reheat cold gas to the virial temperature of the halo , the amount of cold gas lost to the interstellar medium in time @xmath30 can be estimated as , @xmath31 the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath29 together control the luminosity and cold gas content of a galaxy . in kwg ,",
    "these parameters were fixed so that the central galaxy of a @xmath32 km s@xmath4 halo at z=0 had a luminosity and gas content equal to that of the milky way .",
    "let us now consider this set of halos at some later redshift , @xmath33 .",
    "our monte carlo merging histories tell us which halos present at redshift @xmath11 have merged with each other to form a larger object .",
    "the central galaxy of this new halo is identified with the central galaxy of its largest predecessor .",
    "the galaxies that have formed inside the smaller predecessors become _ satellites_. these satellites merge with the central galaxy at a rate governed by the dynamical friction timescale ( see kwg for more details ) .",
    "in this section , we place constraints on cosmological models and on the star formation history of galaxies using the observed evolution of the hi mass density contributed by damped ly@xmath0 systems .",
    "we consider three cosmological models :    1 .   a b=1.5 cdm model .",
    "this is the lowest value of @xmath34 allowed by the observed abundance of rich clusters ( white et al .",
    "a cobe normalized model would have b=1 .",
    "2 .   a b=2.5 cdm model .",
    "3 .   a mdm model with @xmath2 normalized to cobe .",
    "this value of the neutrino mass density has been shown to provide the best fit to the observed large scale structure and streaming motions of galaxies ( klypin et al .",
    "1993 ; pogosyan & starobinsky 1993 ) .    in all three cases ,",
    "we assume @xmath35 and @xmath19 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 . in our formalism",
    ", the influence of the choice of cosmological model is reflected by the way the mass distribution of dark matter halos changes as a function of redshift .",
    "structure forms progressively later as we proceed from model 1 to model 3 in the list above . in the mdm model , galaxy - sized halos only become abundant at redshifts less than 1 .    the equations governing cooling and star formation within the halos",
    "have already been described in section 2 .",
    "note that equation ( 3 ) implies that stars always form at a rate proportional to the mass of cold gas in the halo . in figure 1",
    ", we plot the total mass density of cold gas contained in halos with circular velocities between 50 and 300 km s@xmath4 , corresponding to the circular velocities of present - day spiral galaxies . as can be seen , the predicted @xmath1 matches the observations at low redshift in all three models .",
    "this is not unexpected because we have tuned the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath29 in equations 3 and 4 to match the gas mass of a milky way - type galaxy at the present day .",
    "however , @xmath1 does not increase with redshift in any of these models as in the data .",
    "it either remains flat or , in the case of the mdm model , drops off at high redshift .",
    "it is clear than in order to reproduce the observed increase in the hi mass density , stars must form less efficiently at high redshift .",
    "we now show that structure formation occurs too late in the mdm model to account for the large mass of high column - density neutral hydrogen observed at large redshifts , even if we neglect star formation completely .",
    "the short - dashed / dotted line in figure 1 shows the mass density contributed by _ all _ baryons in halos with circular velocities between 50 and 300 km s@xmath4 .",
    "recall that we have chosen @xmath18 .",
    "this curve falls below the observational data at redshifts greater than 2 .",
    "the hypothesis that damped ly@xmath0 systems are the progenitors of spiral galaxies is simply not viable for an mdm cosmology .",
    "we can make an even stronger case against mdm by considering the mass density contributed by baryons in halos with @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ( the long - dashed / dotted line in figure 1 ) .",
    "this curve falls below the observations at @xmath36 .",
    "rees ( 1986 ) has shown that an external uv background of an intensity 10@xmath37 erg @xmath38 s@xmath4 hz@xmath4 sr@xmath4 , sufficient to satisfy the gunn - peterson constraints on the ionization of the diffuse intergalactic medium and explain the proximity effect at redshifts @xmath39 ( lu et al .",
    "1991 ) , would cause gas to be stably confined in halos with @xmath40 km s@xmath4 .",
    "gas would then be unable to dissipate and collapse to form a system with high column - density .",
    "mdm models thus appear to be ruled out even if damped ly@xmath0 systems have no connection with present - day disk galaxies .",
    "this is not true of either of the two cdm models we have considered .",
    "in this section , we present a model which can fit the observations .",
    "we modify the star formation law in equation 3 to allow for a star formation efficiency which decreases with redshift , and we focus on the b=1.5 cdm model .",
    "we now write @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the redshift at which star formation `` switches on '' .",
    "the heavy solid line in figure 1 shows the evolution of @xmath1 for a b=1.5 cdm model and the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we are now able to reproduce the observed increase in @xmath1 at high redshift .",
    "these parameters also leads to a `` milky way '' gas mass and luminosity that matches observations .",
    "next we investigate whether we can reproduce the observed distribution of damped ly@xmath0 absorber column densities .",
    "we assume for simplicity that gas cooling in a halo collapses to form a planar disk with a radial hi profile @xmath46 when viewed face on .",
    "we also assume that this profile has exponential form : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the central column density of the disk .",
    "bosma ( 1981 ) has made a detailed study of the radial distribution of hi gas in spiral galaxies .",
    "he finds that n(hi ) typically decreases from a few times @xmath49 @xmath38 at the centre of the disk to @xmath50 @xmath38 at about 1.5 holmberg radii .",
    "the holmberg radius for a typical @xmath51 galaxy is about 15 - 18 kpc .",
    "this implies an hi disk scale length of about 8 kpc . we have adopted a simple scaling relation for the scale length of disks forming inside a halo of circular velocity @xmath12 at redshift @xmath11 : @xmath52 this is motivated by the relationship between the virial radius of a dark matter halo and its circular velocity ( white & frenk 1991 ) @xmath53    following fall & pei ( 1993 ) , the column density distribution at redshift z may be written @xmath54 dv_c,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the number density of halos with circular velocity in the range @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting column density distributions for 3 different redshift bins are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we see that our exponential disk model is able to provide a reasonable match to the observations , including the increase in the number of high column density systems with redshift .    in figure 3a",
    ", we show the star formation rate as a function of redshift for a milky way - type galaxy .",
    "the star formation rate increases rapidly , peaking at 8 @xmath61 yr@xmath4 at a redshift 1 and then declining to about 2 @xmath61 yr@xmath4 by the present day as all the cold gas is used up in the galaxy .",
    "we have used the spectral synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) and a scalo imf to compute the spectrum of a galaxy with this star formation history at the present day . in figure 3b",
    "we compare the resulting spectrum with the observed spectra of typical sb and sc galaxies .",
    "the spectra are taken from kennicutt ( 1992 ) .",
    "the model spectrum has a 4000  break and optical colours intermediate between those of the two galaxies .",
    "we therefore conclude that our empirically - motivated star formation law ( equation 6 ) can produce disks with spectral energy distributions consistent with those of present - day galaxies like the milky way .",
    "in this paper , we have assumed that damped ly@xmath0 systems are the progenitors of present - day spiral galaxies and we have used their observed properties to place constraints on cosmological models and the history of star formation in disks .",
    "we have shown that the observed evolution of @xmath1 contributed by these systems implies that stars must have formed considerably less efficiently in the past .",
    "mdm models are unable to reproduce the mass of cold gas seen at high redshift , even in the absence of star formation .",
    "this model predicts that at redshifts greater than 3 , most of the mass in the universe is in halos too small to permit photo - ionized gas to dissipate and collapse to form high column - density systems .",
    "we present an empirically - motivated star formation law that can reproduce most of the observed properties of damped ly@xmath0 systems in a b=1.5 cdm cosmology . using a simple model for an absorber as a planar exponential disk , we are able to match the evolution of @xmath1 and the distribution of column densities as a function of redshift . for b=1.5 cdm",
    ", we require that the star formation efficiency decreases in proportion to the square of the redshift and that no stars form in disks at redshifts greater than 4 .",
    "this upper limit to the redshift of star formation would be relaxed in a model where structure forms at an earlier epoch , for example in low - density models with @xmath62 or in models with higher normalization ( lower @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is not clear what physical mechanism would cause star formation to be less efficient at high redshift .",
    "perhaps certain processes such as satellite accretion occur more frequently in the past and are able to thicken the disk and stabilize it against perturbations .",
