    "since late 80 s many works have been devoted to the study of lipschitz equivalence ( see @xcite and references therein ) . an effective method , to our knowledge , was first employed in @xcite for establishing a bi - lipschitz mapping between the @xmath6-cantor set and the @xmath7-cantor set , the main idea of which is to show these two self - similar sets to have same graph - directed structure satisfying the strong separation condition .",
