    "in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions , generally in odd - dimensional space - time , a peculiar type of quantum field theory exists . that is a theory with a _ chern - simons term _ in its action .  @xcite the chern - simons term may be added to the action by hand or induced in an effective action by a vacuum polarization effect of a fermion as the anomaly  @xcite .",
    "our understanding on the theory has been progressed especially through studies of the topological structure due to the chern - simons term .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , two important phenomena were discovered in condensed matter systems .",
    "one is the quantum hall effect  @xcite and the other is the high-@xmath1 superconductivity  @xcite . both phenomena may be thought of as realization of macroscopic quantum effects in _ planar _ systems in which electrons have a strong correlation .",
    "it is challenging to ask whether and how the chern - simons term is related to these phenomena discovered in the two - dimensional electron systems .",
    "these situations have activated the study of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum field theories .    in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theories ,",
    "the behaviour in the infrared region seems to be unstable at least in the perturbative treatment .",
    "the chern - simons term gives the gauge field a topological mass without breaking gauge symmetry so that the term may rescue the theory from the infrared catastrophe .",
    "this is original motivation of including the chern - simons term in the action .",
    "@xcite reminding those studies , we think that one of the most important problems which is still not clear is what is a role of the chern - simons term in a @xmath2 region .",
    "it is our purpose to clarify how the chern - simons term affects nonperturbative dynamics .    the dynamical mass generation of the fermion is an important phenomenon induced by the nonperturbative effects .",
    "in even - dimensional space - time , chiral symmetry forbids the mass of the fermion .",
    "the nonperturbative effects can break this symmetry giving the mass to the fermion . as is well known",
    ", we can not define the chiral symmetry for the @xmath3-component fermion which belongs to the irreducible spinor representation in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "instead parity symmetry ( @xmath4 ) forbids the two - component fermion having the mass . on the other hand ,",
    "for the @xmath5-component fermion which is composed of @xmath3 two - component fermions , we can define a kind of `` chiral '' symmetry .",
    "the `` chiral '' transformation is defined by a combination of the parity and @xmath6 flavour transformations .",
    "( @xmath7 )    many studies on the dynamical mass generation in @xmath0 have been done already by using the schwinger - dyson technique  @xcite or the lattice monte - carlo method  @xcite . in almost of previous works",
    ", these authors have studied the dynamical mass generation of the four - component fermions in the theory without the chern - simons term , which is a spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath8 but not @xmath4 .",
    "these studies have been extended to the case with the chern - simons term but the fermion considered there has been the four - component one .  @xcite    the theory with @xmath9 four - component fermions is equivalent to the theory with @xmath10 two - component fermions . in this sense",
    ", the theory with the four - component fermions can describe only the case with even number of flavours ( counting the two - component fermions ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask what happens in the theory with odd number of flavours .",
    "this also is another motivation of the present work .",
    "the simplest version of the theory with odd number of flavours is the case with a single flavour .",
    "the first work concerned with the dynamical mass generation of the single @xmath3-component fermion in @xmath0 without the chern - simons term was done in ref .",
    "the symmetry which was studied in the work is @xmath4 but not @xmath8 . in this paper",
    ", we extend the work to the case with the chern - simons term .",
    "thus we consider the dynamical mass generation of the @xmath11 @xmath3-component fermion in @xmath0 @xmath12 the chern - simons term .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations are formulated in the lowest ladder approximation , which are two coupled integral equations . due to the chern - simons term",
    ", a drastic change happens in the structure of the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "while the wave function renormalization is absent in the landau gauge in @xmath0 without the chern - simons term as far as we consider in the lowest ladder approximation , the inclusion of the chern - simons term makes impossible to choose a peculiar gauge in which the wave function is not renormalized . because there are no _ ad hoc",
    "_ reasons that the landau gauge is specific in @xmath0 with the chern - simons term , we should study the coupled integral equations for various values of the gauge parameter .",
    "our strategy in this work are as follows : first we solve the coupled integral equations in an approximated analytical method which is very crude but may be available for reference in a more complete numerical calculation .",
    "after that , the coupled integral equations are solved numerically . in these analyses , we study dependence of the dynamical mass on the gauge - fixing parameter , the coupling constant , and the topological mass .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we explain the model which we use .",

    ", the chiral symmetry requires that a fermion is massless . in odd - dimensions ,",
    "the chiral symmetry itself does not exist .",
    "instead , the mass term of the fermion is forbidden by parity symmetry .",

    "we study how the breaking of parity by the topological mass affects the mass generation of the fermion .",
    "as a non - perturbative method to evaluate the dynamical mass of the fermion , we use here the schwinger - dyson technique . the schwinger - dyson equation for the fermion self - energy @xmath26 is written as @xmath27 @xmath28 is a full vertex function and @xmath29 is a full propagator of the gauge field .",

    "further we have discovered some novel features in the numerical analysis .",
    "first we have found @xmath97 in the landau gauge .",
    "it is not entirely obvious why the numerical evaluation of so complicated integral equations results that @xmath82 is almost equal to 1 at @xmath72 .",
    "we may expect that there is any simple reason .",
    "it also should be noticed that the trivial @xmath32 in the landau gauge is obtained merely in the lowest ladder approximation .",
    "@xcite more sophisticated approximation will be considered in subsequent works .",
    "secondly we have found the strange behaviour of @xmath82 and @xmath81 in the region @xmath111 .",
    "there has appeared the doubling signal in the iterations .",
    "the signal is a popular phenomena in a non - linear system .",
    "we wonder that the signal appeared here would have any physical or mathematical meaning or not .",
    "as the third , it seems that the dynamical mass of the fermion is almost constant if @xmath14 is larger than @xmath58 , while it decreases when @xmath14 is comparable to or smaller than @xmath58 . why it is ? in the case of @xmath112 ,",
    "we have found just one solution in our numerical analysis . on the other hand , we know that there exist two solutions in the case of @xmath83  @xcite ; one is trivial ( @xmath113 ) and the other one nontrivial ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "we have extrapolated our numerical data @xmath104 to @xmath83 by using the method of least squares  @xcite and obtained fig .",
    "9 . the numerical evaluations in @xmath0 without the chern - simons term results @xmath115 ( @xmath72 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "the value obtained by the extrapolation is @xmath116 so that both results may be consistent with each other .",
    "thus , the solution in the case of @xmath112 seems to approach the non - trivial one as @xmath70 .",
    "of course , we should be careful before accepting this result . as mentioned in v - c ,",
    "the numerical evaluation in the region of @xmath117 is very difficult technically and the behaviour of the solution in taking the limit @xmath70 is still not clear .",
    "there might appear any critical behaviour such as a bifurcation of the solution . the best way to confirm",
    "the result is to give a proof by analytical method but it is very difficult because the integral equations are highly non - linear",
    ". we are now extending the parameter region to search any more non - trivial structure especially in the region of @xmath118 .",
    "the result will be reported separately .",
