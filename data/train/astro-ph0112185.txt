    "the fundamental quantity in galaxy dynamics is the distribution function ( df ) , which specifies the distribution of the stars in a galaxy over position and velocity . by jeans theorem ,",
    "the df is a function of the isolating integrals that are conserved by the corresponding potential ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1962 ; binney 1982 ) .",
    "axisymmetric galaxies , which we will study here , conserve at least the two classical integrals of motion , the energy @xmath1 and the vertical component of the angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the df can generally not be measured directly , but since observationally accessible quantities , such as the projected density and the line - of - sight velocity , are simple moments of the df , photometric and kinematic observations can provide information on its properties . in some cases , the part of a two - integral distribution function that is even in the velocities , @xmath3 , can be obtained analytically by using integral transforms to solve the relation between the df and the intrinsic density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the usual cylindrical coordinates . the odd part can be found similarly from @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean streaming velocity .",
    "these laplace ( lynden - bell 1962 ; lake 1981 ) , stieltjes ( hunter 1975b ) and laplace - mellin ( dejonghe 1986 ) transforms have the drawback that numerical implementation is difficult and that they require @xmath8 and @xmath9 to be explicit functions of the potential @xmath10 and the cylindrical radius @xmath11 . a more general formalism ( hunter & qian 1993 ; qian et al .  1995 , hereafter q95 ) ,",
    "the hq - method , uses contour integration instead of integral transforms .",
    "this means it is simpler to implement , does not explicitly require @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but a suitable contour for the integration has to be chosen , which may not always be at hand .    because of the drawbacks of these analytical formalisms , numerical methods that can be applied to arbitrary potential - density pairs are more attractive .",
    "various methods have been developed , many of which circumvent knowledge of the df by solving the jeans equations directly ( van der marel et al .  1994 ; magorrian 1995 ) , while others assume that the df can be represented by a superposition of basis functions ( dehnen & gerhard 1994 ; kuijken 1995 ) .",
    "accurate estimates of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath14 can be obtained in both ways ( van der marel 1991 ; shaw et al .",
    "1993 ; van den bosch 1996 ) .",
    "the predicted central black hole masses that are obtained with two - integral models ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) seem to overestimate the true values , but are still very useful to narrow down the parameter range for more sophisticated modeling ( van der marel et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter vdm98 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; bower et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "numerical orbit integrations and observations of , e.g. , the anisotropy of the stellar dispersions in the solar neighbourhood show that , in addition to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a third integral is conserved for most orbits . in separable potentials ,",
    "this third integral is exact and has a closed form ( e.g. , kuzmin 1956 ; de zeeuw 1985 ) , allowing a direct calculation of the df ( e.g. , dejonghe & de zeeuw 1988 ) .",
    "the most general family of these potentials corresponds to flattened mass models with constant - density cores ( de zeeuw , franx & peletier 1986 ) , which provide a poor description of the inner regions of most galaxies , since these contain a central density cusp ( lauer et al.1995 ) .",
    "we conclude that many of the existing two - integral , as well as the analytical three - integral methods , are applicable to a limited range of galaxy models .",
    "a flexible method for calculating numerical galaxy models was designed by schwarzschild ( 1979 , 1982 ) , who represented the df numerically by the occupation numbers in a superposition of building blocks .",
    "there are no restrictions on the density or the potential , and no a priori assumptions have to be made about the shape or the degree of anisotropy of the galaxy .",
    "schwarzschild s original implementation was aimed at reproducing a given triaxial density distribution and was subsequently applied to a large variety of galaxy models , from spherically and axially symmetric ( richstone & tremaine 1984 ; levison & richstone 1985 ) to triaxial density distributions ( e.g. , vietri 1986 ; statler 1987 ; schwarzschild 1993 , merritt & fridman 1996 ; siopis & kandrup 2000 ) .",
    "more general versions of the method can also reproduce kinematical observations of spherically and axially symmetric galaxies that obey up to three integrals of motion ( zhao 1996 ; rix et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter r97 ; cretton et al .  1999 , hereafter c99 ; cretton et al .",
    "2000 ; hfner et al .",
    "2000).=-2    in most implementations of schwarzschild s method , orbits are used as individual building blocks . in non - separable potentials the third integral of motion is not known explicitly , so that the orbital properties can only be obtained by solving the equations of motion numerically .",
    "this orbit integration has to be carried out until the relevant quantities have averaged out and do not change upon a new time - step ( pfenniger 1984 ; copin et al .",
    "2000 ) . especially for orbits that are near - stochastic , or that have nearly commensurate fundamental frequencies ,",
    "this condition is difficult to achieve and the orbit integration can be very time - consuming . furthermore , an orbit fills a region in space that can have sharp edges , depending on the combination of integrals of motion that it obeys .",
    "a superposition of a finite ( and relatively small ) number of orbits can therefore show artefacts that are caused by these edges .",
    "one way to solve this is to ` blur ' orbits in phase - space randomly , another is to use building blocks that are smoother ( e.g. , zhao 1996 ; merritt & fridman 1996 ; r97 ; c99 ) .",
    "of particular interest are the so - called isotropic and two - integral components ( ics and tics ) .",
    "isotropic components , which are completely specified by their energy @xmath1 , fill the volume inside the equipotential at @xmath1 , while tics , which are fixed once @xmath1 and @xmath2 are chosen , completely fill the corresponding zero - velocity curve ( zvc ) .",
    "the advantages of these building blocks is apparent : both the equipotential and the zvc are smooth surfaces , and ics and tics can be considered as weighted combinations of all orbits with the same energy @xmath1 ( or @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , including the irregular orbits .",
    "these building blocks can be used in schwarzschild s method in two ways .",
    "they can be added to every energy or every combination @xmath15 of a ( three - integral ) orbit library , which will ` automatically ' take care of the stochastic orbits ( zhao 1996 ; r97 ; c99 ) .",
    "alternatively , a fully isotropic or two - integral model can be constructed by using only ics or tics as building blocks .",
    "c99 suggested that this might be a practical way of constructing such models , and derived some analytic properties , but did not pursue these models further .",
    "we do so in this paper and concentrate on the two - integral case , since the properties of the isotropic components follow from those of the tics by taking @xmath16 .    in  [ sec",
    ": method ] , we collect the properties of the tics , and summarize how we use them in schwarzschild s method .",

    "we also study a set of mass models with a central black hole , and show that our method is able to detect when a self - consistent solution does not exist .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "the density distribution is dimpled on the symmetry axis , and , for some choices of @xmath150 , even becomes negative . in advance",
    ", we can therefore rule out a ( small ) range of parameters for which the df does not exist .",
    "the physical range of @xmath148 decreases when @xmath151 is decreased . at @xmath152 , which is considered here ,",
    "models with @xmath153 show this behaviour .",
    "we study the range @xmath154 .",
    "we added a central black hole with a mass @xmath155% of the total mass , and calculated self - consistent two - integral models using the same grid settings as in  [ sec : kk ] .",
    "[ fig : alpha_q ] shows the contours of constant @xmath94 as a function of @xmath128 and @xmath148 .",
    "as expected , the @xmath94 is zero for values @xmath156 and rises rapidly above @xmath157 , indicating that self - consistent two - integral distribution functions do not exist at these values of the central cusp slope .",
    "however , for @xmath158 , the transition to @xmath159 occurs at values of @xmath160 , which means that these flatter models have an even larger freedom in possible central cusp slopes .",
    "the points that contribute most to this nonzero @xmath94 are located in the center of the model , i.e. , near the black hole , and experiments with a denser sampling in the integrals of motion give similar results .",
    "the limiting behavior of the density is ( cf.eq  ( [ rhopl ] ) @xmath161,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the importance of the constant term in the expansion  ( [ densjos ] ) decreases when @xmath148 decreases .",
    "this may gradually relax the restriction on @xmath128 in the numerical model .",
    "a similar effect has been found recently in oblate sridhar - touma models ( jalali & de zeeuw 2001 ) , which resemble the power - law models in many respects . however , the values of @xmath148 for which this occurs are much smaller than the observed flattenings of early - type galaxies .",
    "we have presented an alternative to the existing analytical and numerical methods for calculating two - integral distribution functions .",
    "it is based upon schwarzschild s orbit superposition method and able to deal with arbitrary density profiles and galaxy potentials . instead of orbital building blocks",
    ", we use the so - called two - integral components , which are smoother and implicitly include stochastic orbits . due to their delta - function behaviour ,",
    "the observables can be calculated ( semi-)analytically , which speeds up the calculations considerably .",
    "we checked that the method is able to reproduce a known combination of potential , density and distribution function and tested the regularisation algorithm in the process .",
    "this test shows that fitting the meridional plane masses alone is not enough to constrain the df , while including a ( modest ) amount of regularisation is enough to smoothen the df toward the theoretical curve .",
    "we have also tested the @xmath94 ( [ eq : chisq ] ) , which measures the quality - of - fit of the resulting model , against analytical investigations .",
    "this demonstrates that a high value of @xmath94 can be taken as a sure indication that the model does not exist .",
    "these results show that our method is flexible and reproduces analytical results very closely .",
    "additionally , many of the characteristics of the implementation that we used , such as the regularisation method and the @xmath94-parameter , are used in more general ( three - integral ) models .",
    "regularisation is therefore also a very useful and necessary tool to smoothen the distribution function that is found by these methods , and the @xmath94-parameter is a useful diagnostic to test the existence of the resulting models .",
    "applications in which we calculate fully three - integral models ( including tics ) of observed kinematics will follow in a subsequent paper .",
