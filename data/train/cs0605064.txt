    "reasoning about topological relations between regions in space is recognized as one of the most important and challenging research areas within spatial reasoning in artificial intelligence ( ai ) and philosophy , spatial and constraint databases , and geographical information systems ( giss ) .",
    "research in this area can be classified according to the logical apparatus employed :     first - order theories of topological relations between regions , as studied in ai and philosophy @xcite , spatial databases @xcite and from an algebraic viewpoint in @xcite ;     purely existential theories formulated as constraint satisfaction systems over jointly exhaustive and mutually disjoint sets of topological relations between regions @xcite     modal logics of space with operators interpreted by the closure and interior operator of the underlying topological space and propositions interpreted as subsets of the topological space , see e.g. , @xcite .    a similar classification can be made for temporal reasoning : we have general first - order theories  @xcite , temporal constraint systems @xcite and modal temporal logics like prior s tense logics , ltl , and ctl @xcite . surprisingly , one of the most natural approaches to temporal reasoning has not yet found a fully developed analogue on the spatial reasoning research agenda : halpern and shoham s modal logic of intervals @xcite , in which propositions are evaluated at intervals ( rather than time points ) , and where reference to other intervals is enabled by modal operators interpreted by allen s 13 relations between intervals , see also @xcite . despite its bad computational behavior ( undecidable , usually not even r.e . ) , this framework proved rather fruitful and influential in temporal reasoning , see e.g.   @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider modal logics in which propositions are evaluated at the regions of topological spaces , and reference to other regions is enabled by modal operators interpreted as topological relations . for defining such logics , the two most important decisions to be made are choosing an appropriate set of relations and identifying a suitable notion of a `` region '' in a topological space .    regarding the relations , in the initially mentioned research areas there appears to be consensus that the eight egenhofer - franzosa ( or @xmath1 ) relations , which have been independently introduced in @xcite and @xcite , and their coarser relative @xmath2 consisting of only five relations , are the most fundamental sets of relations between regions of topological spaces  both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the current paper we concentrate on these two sets of relations .",
    "we should note that modal logics based on the egenhofer - franzosa relations have been suggested in an early paper by cohn @xcite and further considered in  @xcite .",
    "however , it proved difficult to analyze the expressive power and computational behavior of such logics : despite several efforts , to the best of our knowledge no results have been obtained so far .",
    "concerning the regions of a topological space , we adopt a rather relaxed view : we generally assume that regions are non - empty regular closed subsets of a topological space , but we do not require that _ every _ such subset is a region .",
    "this view allows us to consider logical structures , henceforth called _ region structures _",
    ", that are based on various kinds of regions . among others ,",
    "we consider the following options :     region structures in which the set of regions is _ exactly _ the set of non - empty regular closed subsets of a topological space .",
    " in the euclidean space @xmath3 , region structures where regions are identified with all non - empty convex regular closed sets , or with all hyper - rectangles .",
    " substructures of the above region structures : for example , we may admit region structures in which only some , but not all hyper - rectangles of @xmath4 are regions . to distinguish this case from the former two , we call region structures in which all regions of a particular kind are present _ full _ region structures .",
    " finite substructures of the above region structures .",
    "the rationale behind the latter two choices of structures is that , for certain applications , it is sufficient to require the presence of only those regions in region structures that are inhabited by spatial objects .",
    "if it is known that there are only finitely many such objects , but their exact number is unknown , then finite substructures are the appropriate choice .    the main purpose of this paper is to _ introduce modal logics of topological relations in a systematic way , to perform an investigation of their expressiveness and relationships , and to analyze their computational behavior_. regarding expressiveness , our main result concerns the relationship to first - order theories of topological relations .",
    "the expressive power of our modal logics is incomparable with that standard theories of this kind since modal logics offer an infinite supply of propositional variables corresponding to unary predicates of first - order logic .",
    "in contrast , standard first - order theories of topological relations offer only eight binary predicates interpreted as topological relations , and no unary predicates  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider the extension of first - order theories of topological relations with an infinite number of `` free '' unary predicates . then , we can show that our logics based on the egenhofer - franzosa or relations has exactly the same expressive power as the two - variable fragment of first - order logic on the same set of relations ( indeed , this holds for any mutually disjoint and jointly exhaustive set of topological relations ) .",
    "we also show that first - order logic is exponentially more succinct .",
    "we argue that the availability of unary predicates is essential for a wide range of application areas : in contrast to describing only purely topological properties of regions , it allows one to also capture other properties such as being a country ( in a gis ) , a ball ( for a soccer - playing robot ) , or a protected area ( in a spatial database ) . in our modal logics",
    ", we can thus formulate constraints based on non - spatial properties such as `` there are no two overlapping regions that are both countries '' and `` every river is connected to an ocean or a lake '' .",
    "the main results of this paper concern the computational behavior of modal logics of topological relations . we prove a very general undecidability result that captures all modal logics of the relations that are determined by a class of region structures whose regions are ( not necesserily all ) non - empty regular closed sets , and that contains at least one infinite structure .",
    "it is interesting to note that this result also covers logics that are determined by _ substructures _ of region structures . in particular",
    ", it captures the substructures of the real line where regions are intervals , and thus improves upon undecidability results for interval temporal logics by halpern and shoham that do not capture substructures of interval structures @xcite . using a variation of the proof of our central theorem",
    ", we can even show that logics based on finite substructures of region structures are undecidable .",
    "although our results show that moving from full region structures to substructures does not help to regain decidability , there is an improvement in computational complexity : we show that most logics of relations based on full region structures are @xmath5-hard and thus not recursively enumerable .",
    "in contrast , we also prove that many logics determined by substructures _ are _ recursively enumerable .",
    "finally , we establish the undecidability of a number of modal logics based on the relations .",
    "the result is less general and , for example , does not cover the substructure case .",
    "recursive enumerability of -based logics is left as an open problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : structures ] , we introduce region structures as the semantical basis for modal logics of topological relations . the modal language is introduced in section  [ sect : languages ] . in this section , we also compare its expressiveness to that of first - order logic . additionally , we show that our modal logics are strictly more expressive than topological constraint satisfaction problems . in section  [",
    "sect : logics ] , we introduce a number of natural modal logics based on the egenhofer - franzosa relations that are induced by different notions of regions , and briefly analyze their relationship . in section  [",
    "sect : rcc8undec ] , we then prove the central undecidability result capturing basically all interesting modal logics of relations determined by sets of region structures containing at least one infinite structure . for logics of full region structures ,",
    "this is strengthened to a @xmath5-hardness proof in section  [ sect : notre ] .",
    "we also prove recursive enumerability of many modal logics based on substructures of region structures . in section  [",
    "sect : finite ] , we prove undecidability of logics determined by classes of finite region structures . finally , in section  [ sect : rcc5 ] we consider modal logics based on the relations .",
    "the purpose of the logics considered in this paper is to reason about regions in topological spaces . in this section ,",
    "we show how a topological space together with an appropriate definition of `` region '' induces a logical structure , and establish some basic properties of the structures obtained in this way .",
    "recall that a topological space is a pair @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a set and @xmath8 is an _ interior operator _ on @xmath7 , i.e. , for all @xmath9 , we have @xmath10      \\mathbb{i}(s ) \\cap \\mathbb{i}(t ) & = & \\mathbb{i}(s \\cap t ) & &      \\mathbb{i}\\mathbb{i}(s ) & = & \\mathbb{i}(s ) .",

    "depending on the application domain , different definitions of regions in topological spaces have been introduced .",
    "almost all of them have in common that the regions of a topological space @xmath15 are identified with some set of non - empty , regular closed subsets of @xmath7 , where a subset @xmath16 is called _ regular closed _ if @xmath17",
    ". some popular choices for topological spaces and regions are the following :    * the set @xmath18 of all non - empty regular closed subsets of some topological space @xmath19 , in particular the topological spaces @xmath4 for some @xmath20 ; * the set @xmath21 of non - empty convex regular closed subsets of @xmath3 , for some @xmath20 ; * the set @xmath22 of closed hyper - rectangular subsets of @xmath3 , i.e. , regions of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are non - singleton closed intervals in @xmath25 , for some @xmath20 .    sometimes , regions are required to satisfy additional constraints such as being connected or homeomorphic to the closed unit disc .",
