    "zeus collaboration at hera has recently published @xcite data on pion structure function , @xmath1 , using the leading neutron production in @xmath0 collision .",
    "the data do suggest that there is a simple relation between proton structure function , @xmath2 , and the pion structure function @xmath1 .",
    "this assertion is believable and points to the direction that there exists a more basic and universal structure inside all hadrons .",
    "+ in ref.[1 ] the normalization of @xmath3 and hence , the pion structure function is fixed by two different methods : ( a ) dominance of one pion exchange , and ( b ) use of the additive quark model .",
    "the two normalizations differ by a factor of two .",
    "the additive quark model makes no statement about the leading baryon production while the extraction of @xmath1 is completely based on meson exchange dynamics . a criticism of this procedure is given in @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the issue of normalization of the data is more uncertain than it was thought before .",
    "zeus coll . now believes that most likely the final result will lie between the two options @xcite .",
    "the issue is what to use for @xmath4 that parameterizes the shape of the pion cloud in the proton . in this paper",
    "we will offer an alternative , which does not rely on those assumptions and renders support to a normalization , which lies between the two options used by the zeus coll .",
    "+ in what follows we have used the structure function of a constituent quark ( cq ) , ( in ref.@xcite it is called _ valon _ and hence the _ valon model _ ) which is universal to all hadrons and from there , with a convolution method , the structure function of pion is obtained .",
    "the motivation for such an approach is based on the fact that such a model for soft production has found phenomenological success at @xmath5 gev and low @xmath6 .",
    "it should , however , be understood that when @xmath7 is high enough to generate a significant component of hard subprocesses @xmath8 , @xmath9 and average @xmath6 will both increase and inclusive distributions will lose their scaling behavior . nevertheless , the soft component is unchanged , and the model remains valid .",
    "+ our knowledge of hadronic structure is based on the hadron spectroscopy and the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data . in the former picture",
    "quarks are massive particles and their bound states describe the static properties of hadrons ; while the interpretation of dis data relies upon the qcd lagrangian , where the hadronic structure is intimately connected with the presence of a large number of partons .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that it is possible to perturbatively dress a valence qcd lagrangian field to all order and construct a constituent quark in conformity with the color confinement .",
    "therefore , the assumption of constituent quark as a valence quark with its cloud of partons is reasonable .",
    "the cloud is generated by qcd dynamics . a complete description and calculational procedure for obtaining the constituent quark structure , and",
    "hence , the hadronic structure functions are detailed in @xcite .",
    "by definition , a valon is a universal building block for every hadron . in a dis experiment at high enough",
    "@xmath10 it is the structure of valon that is being probed , while at low enough @xmath10 this structure can not be resolved and it behaves as the valence quark and the hadron is viewed as the bound state of its valons . for a u - type valon one can write its structure as , @xmath11 where all the functions on the right - hand side are the probability functions for quarks having momentum fraction @xmath12 of a u - type valon at @xmath10 .",
    "these functions are calculated in ref . [ 6 ] in the next - to - leading order and we will not go into the details here . suffices to note that the functional forms of the parton distributions in a constituent quark , ( or valon ) , is as follows [ 6 ] : @xmath13 @xmath14\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc .",
    "are functions of @xmath10 and are given in the appendix of ref.[6 ] .",
    "the above parameterization of the parton distribution in a valon is for light quarks , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for heavy quarks",
    "additional phenomenological assumptions are needed to be made .",
    "it is known that in proton the strange quark distribution is smaller than up quark by a factor of 2 at some regions of @xmath21 and by the time @xmath21 reaches down to @xmath22,we have @xmath23 . as for the charm",
    "quark content of proton , the picture is less clear .",
    "early treatments of heavy parton distributions assumed that for @xmath24 , the heavy quark , @xmath25 , should be considered as massless . at the opposite extreme",
    ", the heavy quark has never been regarded as part of the nucleon sea but produced perturbatively through photon - gluon fusion .",
    "the number of flavors remain fixed , regardless of @xmath10 .",
    "this treatment is used in grv 94 parton distribution@xcite .",
    "both schemes have their own deficiency .",
    "for example , in the former scheme , the heavy quark should not be treated as massless for @xmath26 and in the latter scheme one can not incorporate large logarithms at @xmath27 .",
    "cteq @xcite on the other hand , have used an interpolation , which produces relative features of both schemes . in this treatment ,",
    "the heavy quarks are essentially produced by photon - gluon fusion when @xmath28 and considered as massless quark when @xmath29 . in our treatment , however , since we are dealing with low @xmath21-values , we will assume @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , where @xmath18 is a factor taken to be equal to the ratio of the strange and charm quark masses when @xmath32 ; and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "although such an undertaking is not free of ambiguity , however , that does not change our qualitative arguments regarding the normalization of the data .",
    "+ equations ( 1 - 3 ) completely determine the structure of a valon .",
    "the structure function of any hadron can be written as the convolution of the structure function of a valon with the valon distribution in the hadron : @xmath35 where summation runs over the number of cq s in a particular hadron .",
    "@xmath36 denotes the structure function of a cq ( u , d , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc . ) , as given in equation ( 1 ) , and @xmath39 is the probability of finding a valon carrying momentum fraction @xmath40 of the hadron .",
    "it is independent of the nature of probe and its @xmath10 value .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , for the case of pion we have : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the u - valon distribution of in @xmath43 as well as the d - valon distribution in @xmath44 .",
    "similar expression for @xmath45 , anti - valon distribution in a pion , is obtained by interchanging @xmath46 . in the above equation @xmath47",
    "is euler @xmath48 function and @xmath39 are non - invariant distributions satisfying the following number and momentum sum rules : @xmath49 for pion , the numerical values are : @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we have , however , tried a range of values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 and did not find much sensitivity on @xmath1 data against this variations . in @xcite",
    "@xcite it is estimated that @xmath54 , which is very close to the values that are used in this paper . the flatness or almost flatness of the valon distribution in pion",
    "is attributed to the fact that the valons are more massive than the pion , so they are tightly bound . from @xmath55",
    "symmetry one should expect that @xmath56 . in our calculation , @xmath52 is slightly different from @xmath53 , indicating a small violation of @xmath55 symmetry .",
    "this violation is very small and the data on @xmath1 is not sensitive enough to make a large difference .",
    "significant asymmetry is observed in proton sea and its implications are discussed in ref .",
    "[ 6 ] in the context of the valon model .",
    "+ the pion has two valons ( or constituent quarks ) , for example , @xmath43 has a u and a @xmath38 , therefore , the sum in equation ( 4 ) has only two terms .",
    "parton distributions in a pion , say @xmath43 , is obtained as : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 similar relations can be written for @xmath44 and @xmath60 . in the above equations the subscripts @xmath61 and @xmath38 are the two valon types in @xmath43 .",
    "equations ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) along with equation ( 4 ) completes the evaluation of the pion structure function . in figures ( 1 ) we present @xmath62 , as calculated above , for the fixed @xmath10 s corresponding to the zeus data of ref.[1 ] .",
    "in the previous section we outlined the procedure for calculating @xmath62 . the results are shown in figures ( 1 ) by the square points . from the figures ,",
    "it is evident that for smaller @xmath21 and lower @xmath10 values , the results of the model calculations are closer to the additive quark model normalization of the zeus coll .",
    "data ( see figure 19 of ref.[1 ] ) . as we move towards the large @xmath21 values the calculated structure function decreases and gets closer to the effective flux normalization of the data .",
    "if we are to trust in the valon model results , which provides a very good description for the wealth of proton structure function data as well as other hadronic processes , we can conclude that the two normalizations used by zeus may be relevant to different kinematical regions and lends support to the assessment made by the zeus collaboration that the final results will lie between the two options[3 ] .",
    "it is true that the valon model resembles the additive quark model in that the contributions from each valon are added up .",
    "but here we are mainly dealing with the parton content of each valon , which is derived from the perturbative qcd .",
    "the valon distribution in pion serves only as a phenomenological mimic of the pion wave function .",
    "we further note that in the above calculation none of the zeus data for pion structure function is used and no data fitting is performed . +",
    "zeus coll . makes the observation that there is a simple relationship between the proton structure function and the effective pion flux normalization of the pion structure function ( see figure 18 of ref . [ 1 ] ) ; namely @xmath63 with the proportionality constant , @xmath64 .",
    "we have calculate the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 10 ) in the valon model and compared it with the effective flux normalization , @xmath65 , in the left hand side .",
    "the copmarison is presented in figures ( 1 ) .",
    "as one can see from the figures , the relationship holds rather well at all @xmath10 values . to avoid any misleadings , we emphasizs that the direct calculation of @xmath66 in the valon model ( square points in figures ( 1 ) ) is different from @xmath65 and",
    "hence , does not support the effective flux normalization of @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , our finding merely states that if we scale @xmath2 by a factor of @xmath67 we arrive at equation ( 10 ) .",
    "figures ( 1 ) also indicates that the above relationship holds rather well at lower @xmath10 values . as we move to higher @xmath10 this relationship at the lowest @xmath21-value gets blurred , but at large @xmath21 and high @xmath10 it continues to hold .",
    "+ since our model produces very good fit to the proton structure function data in a wide range of both @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] @xmath70 , we have also attempted to investigate the relation : @xmath71 which is based on color - dipole bfkl - regee expansion and corresponds to the zeus s additive quark model normalization .",
    "we have calculated both sides of the equation ( 11 ) in the valon model .",
    "the results are shown by the solid lines and square points in figures ( 1 ) .",
    "although we get similar results as in fig.19 of ref.[1 ] , but this does not say much about the pion structure function data , because the additive quark model normalization of the data is based on the above equation .",
    "it only restates that our model , indeed , correctly produces proton structure function .",
    "the main ingredient of our model is the partonic content of the constituent quark which is calculated based on qcd dynamics .",
    "convolution of this structure with the constituent quark distribution in the pion appears , to some extent , to give support for the additive quark model normalization of the pion structure function data .",
    "in fact , we agree with ref . [ 3 ] that the final results should be somewhere between the two normalizations used by zeus , being much closer to the additive quark model scheme than the pion flux scheme . + it is worth to note that the following relationship also holds very well between zeus s pion flux normalization data and proton structure function : @xmath72 this relationship is essentially the same as eq .",
    "( 10 ) , except for the factor @xmath73 in front of @xmath21 that makes a small correction to the factor @xmath74 of eq .",
    "( 10 ) . in figure ( 2 ) we have presented the right - hand sides of both equations ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) along with the effective flux normalization data from ref.[1 ] at a typical value of @xmath75 .",
    "the same feature is also prevalent for the other values of @xmath10 . + both eqs . (",
    "11 ) and ( 12 ) indicate that , regardless of the choice of normalization scheme , the valence structure of proton , as compared to pion , is shifted to the lower @xmath21 by a factor of @xmath73 , so that valence @xmath21 in proton corresponds to @xmath76 in pion . + zeus has observed that the rate of neutron production in photo - production process , in comparison to that of @xmath77 collision , drops to _ half _ and from this observation zeus coll . has concluded that @xmath78 whereas one expects to get a rather @xmath73 , both from regge factorization and the additive quark model[2 ] .",
    "this poses a problem on the understanding of the dynamics of the interaction .",
    "a tentative resolution is that the discrepancy can be resolved if we suppose that in the process each valon interacts independently . that is the impulse approximation .",
    "suppose that @xmath79 denotes the number of valons in the target proton that suffers a collision and @xmath80 denotes the number of collisions that @xmath81 valon of the projectile encounters .",
    "if we define the integer @xmath82 , then we will have @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath84 represents the probability that out of @xmath79 independent collisions that target valons encounter , @xmath85 valonic collisions occur .",
    "if @xmath86 is the probability that either of the other valons in the projectile also interact , then the probability for @xmath79 collisions will have a binomial distribution having @xmath87 valonic collision by @xmath88 and @xmath89 valons out of a maximum @xmath90 possible such collisions@xcite .",
    "now , for a real photon , we can assume that it may fluctuate into mesons with two valons .",
    "if we denote the number of possible valonic collisions in @xmath91 interaction by @xmath92 then the mean number of such collisions will be @xmath93 whereas in @xmath77 collisions it will be @xmath94 .",
    "the observed reduction in the rate of neutron production in two processes and the conclusion that @xmath95 implies that @xmath96 .",
    "that is , there are twice as many collisions in @xmath77 interactions than in photo - production .",
    "we have demonstrated that the assumption of the existence of a basic structure in hadrons is a reasonable model to investigate the hadronic structure .",
    "pion structure function measurement by zeus coll . provides additional tests and further validation of the model .",
    "we have presented a resolution to the issue of the normalization of the data .",
    "our results are based on qcd dynamics and suggest that the correct normalization of @xmath1 is closer to the additive quark model normalization for low @xmath21 region . the observed reduction in the rate of neutron production in photo - production as compared to @xmath77 collision",
    "is accounted for and concluded that there are twice less valonic collisions in photo - production than in @xmath77 collision .",
    "furthermore , it appears that there are simple relations among the structure functions of hadrons ; namely they are proportional and the proportionality ratio seems to depend on the normalization scheme chosen .",
