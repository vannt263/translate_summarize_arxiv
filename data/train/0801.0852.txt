    "electron interaction and disorder strongly influence the properties of materials .",
    "in particular , the motion of charge carrier particles can be suppressed by coulomb interaction and disorder , and the suppression leads to a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) . in the pure system without disorder",
    "the mit can occur and is purely driven by electron correlations.@xcite the transition is commonly referred to the mott - hubbard mit . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "the mit can occur even without electron interactions .",
    "the state of system changes from extended phase to the anderson localization due to coherent backscattering from randomly distributed impurities.@xcite the mott - hubbard mit is characterized by opening a gap of the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy , while the anderson localization is a gapless insulator . at the anderson localization the spectra change from continuous to dense discrete points .",
    "it is characterized by vanishing of the most probable value of the local density of states ( ldos).@xcite the most probable value of the ldos discriminates between the metal and insulator phases .",
    "the importance of the distribution of the ldos in the proper description of the anderson localization was stressed by anderson.@xcite the very distribution of the ldos determines the anderson localization but not average quantities of the ldos . from the distribution of the ldos one can detect both",
    "the vanishing of the most probable value of ldos as well as the gap opening of the total dos , thus the distribution of the ldos is a valuable tool for determining the mit driven by both disorder and correlation .    in recent years ,",
    "a generalized curie - weiss mean - field theory , the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) was developed.@xcite the dmft essentially captures local temporal fluctuations .",
    "it has been widely applied to study correlated electron systems .",
    "the dmft describes the mott - hubbard mit well.@xcite however , it works with the arithmetic average of the ldos , and can not determine the anderson localization in disordered systems .",
    "a statistical variant of the dmft , which is usually referred to the statistical dmft , has been introduced to study systems with both disorder and interaction.@xcite it can be viewed as the dmft formulated in real space with general inhomogeneous solutions.@xcite within the statistical dmft , the self energy is a local function of frequency , but it also depends on the site index . in the presence of diagonal disorder , the self energy is also diagonal random variables , and gives additional dynamical random contributions to disorder .",
    "it generates a set of self - consistent stochastic equations .",
    "the statistical dmft essentially deals with the ldos , hence it is capable of studying the anderson - mott - hubbard mit . in parallel with the statistical dmft , a typical medium theory ( tmt )",
    "was also introduced to study the anderson localization.@xcite the tmt is based on the dmft too .",
    "however , instead of the arithmetic average dos , it works with the geometric average dos .",
    "the geometric average dos is incorporated into the self - consistent stochastic dmft equations , which result into self - consistent equations of the dmft fashion .",
    "the tmt is essentially a mean - field theory of both disorder and correlation , while in the statistical dmft disorder is treated exactly , and only the correlation effects are treated in a mean - field manner .",
    "the tmt was employed to study the anderson - mott - hubbard mit in correlated electron systems with local disorder.@xcite    in the presence of disorder the ldos forms a stochastic ensemble .",
    "the stochastic ensemble of the ldos must have characteristics which discriminate between the metallic and insulator phases , and one has to search the characteristics for determining the mit .",
    "examples for the characteristics are the most probable value of the ldos in the original anderson theory of localization@xcite or the geometric average of the ldos in the tmt.@xcite however , nearby the critical point of the mit , quantum fluctuations may induce outliers of the statistical description of the stochastic ensemble of the ldos . for a random sample an estimator",
    "is called robust if it is insensitive to outliers.@xcite the most probable value , arithmetic average , median are the examples of robust estimator .",
    "the geometric average is not a robust estimator because it does not fulfil the linear property of the robust estimator.@xcite from the point of view of robust statistics the most probable value is a better estimator of a random sample than the geometric average .",
    "moreover , in general , the geometric average dos is not the most probable value of the ldos , hence it does not truly represent a typical dos , although it is closer to the most probable value of the ldos than the arithmetic average of the ldos .",
    "the geometric average dos is sensitive to small values of the ldos at individual sites , even when these values do not represent the most probable value of the ldos .",
    "a decline of the geometric average dos with increasing the disorder strength does not necessarily imply the approach to the anderson localization.@xcite nevertheless , when the geometric average is embedded into the self - consistent cycle of the dmft , the whole method , i.e the tmt , can describe the anderson localization.@xcite    the interplay between disorder and correlation in the mit theory is a long standing problem . in the clean or noninteracting limits the mit was well studied.@xcite however , the correlation effects in disordered systems still remain unclear .",
    "in particular , despite experiments found evidences of the metallic behavior in the two dimensional electron systems , in theory it is not clear how electron correlations induce metallic phase in low dimensional disordered systems.@xcite in the present paper we consider the interplay of disorder and short range interaction in the mit .",
    "usually , the short range interaction is modelled by the hubbard interaction.@xcite here we take an alternative point of view . rather than try to study the hubbard model we take a simpler model , the spinless falicov - kimball model ( fkm).@xcite the relation of the fkm to the hubbard model is analogous to the relation between the ising and heisenberg models of magnetism .",
    "the fkm describes itinerant electrons interacting via a repulsive contact potential with localized electrons ( or ions ) .",
    "it can also be viewed as a simplified hubbard model where electrons with down spin are frozen and do not hop . certainly , within the tmt",
    "the phase diagram of the anderson - mott - hubbard mit in the fkm and that in the hubbard model share common features.@xcite moreover , the fkm exhibits a rich phase diagram .",
    "in homogeneous phase it exhibits the mott - hubbard type of mit , although the model does not describe the fermi liquid picture . at low temperature different phases with",
    "long - range order may exist depending on the doping and interaction strength.@xcite the fkm can also be incorporated into different models to study various aspects of electron correlations , for instance the charge ordered ferromagnetism in manganites.@xcite in the disordered fkm we can study different realizations of the interplay of disorder and electron correlations . with local disorder",
    "the fkm exhibits the anderson - mott - hubbard mit.@xcite it will be studied in the present paper by employing the statistical dmft . after solving of the self - consistent equations of the statistical dmft we obtain the distributions of the ldos .",
    "we determine the most probable value of the ldos and use it to monitor the anderson localization .",
    "we find extended states which occur in the region from weak to intermediate strengths of interaction and disorder .",
    "for intermediate values of disorder or interaction there is a reentrance of the anderson localization . at strong disorder",
    "the system is a gapless insulator , while at strong interaction the system is a mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "we also find at the crossing point from extended states to localization the most probable value of the ldos exhibits a discontinuity .",

    "it turns out that it is equivalent to @xmath14 and @xmath15.@xcite @xmath16 are independent random variables .",
    "they represent local disorder in the model .",
    "we will consider the random variables with uniform distribution @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the step function , and @xmath19 represents the disorder strength .",
    "when the disorder is absent , model ( [ fkm ] ) is the pure fkm . in homogeneous phase which occurs at high temperature",
    "it exhibits a mott - hubbard mit.@xcite when the interaction is absent ( @xmath20 ) , itinerant and localized electrons are decoupled , and the itinerant electron part of model ( [ fkm ] ) represents the anderson model , and it would exhibit the anderson localization.@xcite thus when both disorder and interaction are present , model ( [ fkm ] ) would exhibit the complex anderson - mott - hubbard mit transition at high temperature.@xcite the fkm may be realized by loading two kinds of fermion atoms with light and heavy masses in optical lattice .",
    "the light atoms play the role of itinerant electrons , while the heavy atoms are kept immobile as the localized electrons .",
    "the main idea of the statistical dmft is to formulate the dmft of the system with a realization of disorder in real space.@xcite when the disorder is realized , the local green function is not homogeneous anymore . in this case",
    "we can adopt the inhomogeneous dmft@xcite for treating the interaction part . within the approach",
    "the disorder is treated exactly , while the effects of electron interaction result into the self energy which is self - consistently calculated by the dmft equations .",

    "the self energy is purely local . for finite dimensions",
    "the approximation neglects nonlocal correlations .",
    "the nonlocal correlations can be systematically incorporated by cluster extensions of the dmft.@xcite the site dependence of the self energy is generated via random variables @xmath16 . as a consequence",
    "the self energy @xmath27 is also stochastic variables . with this feature",
    "the effective mean field and the local green function also are local stochastic variables .",
    "the dyson equation ( [ dyson ] ) shows that the self energy gives additional local random contributions to disorder of the system .",
    "these contributions are due to both interaction and the interplay between interaction and disorder . however , in difference to the random variables @xmath16 the contributions are dynamical .",
    "they take into account temporal local quantum fluctuations generated by interaction and disorder .",
    "they also broaden the random energy levels generated by disorder .",
    "the self energy @xmath27 is determined from an effective single site .",

    "@xmath30 is the electron green function of the effective single site .",
    "the self - consistent condition requires that the green function @xmath30 of the effective single site must concise with the local green function of the original lattice .",
    "i.e. , @xmath31 in the appendix we show the exact derivation of the self consistent equation for inhomogeneous systems in infinite dimensions .",

    "the vanishing of the most probable value of the ldos manifests the anderson localization .",
