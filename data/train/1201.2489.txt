    "this article will propose a class of quantum gravitational models describing a background - free , discrete spacetime , which evolves by means of local causal unitary evolution .",
    "the models in this class will be referred to as duct s ( discrete unitary causal theories ) .",
    "the kinematics of the theory will be loosely inspired by loop quantum gravity , but the primary goal will be to produce consistent dynamics rather than to retain contact with the loop quantization of general relativity .      supposing we think of the universe as a computer  what kind of computer would it be ?    [ [ quantum ] ] quantum + + + + + + +    first of all , the universe is a _ quantum _ computer , since the world displays quantum mechanical interference between possible histories .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum system are described by unitary operators acting on a hilbert space of states .",
    "this is in contrast to a classical system , whose dynamics are described by functions acting on sets of states .    [ [ background - free ] ] background free + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    secondly , general relativity leads us to believe that the universe is a computer in which space and time are themselves part of the dynamical state .",
    "systems with this property are called _ background free _ ( also known as _",
    "background independent _ ) .",
    "a background - free computer is not like the computers which exist on our desktops , since these computers exist in a stable spacetime which they do not affect or control , and upon which they depend .",
    "a background - free theory should have at least the following properties :    1 .",
    "the kinematics of the theory ( which describe space at one time ) should be most naturally expressed in a way which is invariant under spatial diffeomorphims .",
    "2 .   the dynamics of the theory ( describing how things change with time ) should be a pure gauge symmetry . when quantizing canonical general relativity , this is equivalent to imposing the wheeler - de witt hamiltonian constraint equation @xmath0 .",
    "since most kinematic states do not have this property , there is a dramatic reduction in the degrees of freedom of the system as a result of this constraint .",
    "3 .   there should be no absolute notion of simultaneity .",
    "in other words , there is no invariant meaning to `` the same time , but a different place '' . in canonical general relativity , this comes about because the hamiltonian @xmath1 depends on the lapse , which is an arbitrary function of position .",
    "there are many different possible ways to foliate the same spacetime @xcite .",
    "( as wheeler put it , time is `` many - fingered '' @xcite . )    [ [ discrete ] ] discrete + + + + + + + +    a third and more contentious question is whether the universe is a digital or analog computer .",
    "a digital spacetime would be made out of discrete components which evolve forward by discrete time - steps .",
    "an analog computer might have continuous parts , as in field theory .",
    "there is some evidence that quantum gravity should be digital , from the finiteness of black hole entropy in generalized thermodynamics @xcite ( based on the idea that the black hole entropy should count the entropy of some set of microscopic degrees of freedom associated with the horizon @xcite . ) also , in loop quantum gravity , area and volume operators have discrete eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "however , it is very difficult to see how lorentz invariance could act as a symmetry on a discrete spacetime @xcite , although lorentz invariance seems to be necessary for the thermality of hawking radiation @xcite , and the validity of the generalized second law of horizon thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic safety scenario @xcite suggests the possibility of a continuum theory of quantum gravity .",
    "there also seems to be no shortest distance in string theory ( even though in some respects the string length acts as a uv cutoff on the theory ) although it is hard to say what a background - free formulation of string theory might look like .    since the theoretical evidence cuts both ways and there are no experiments",
    ", it would be unwise to be excessively dogmatic about the issue .",
    "nevertheless , for the remainder of this article the digital model will be assumed as a working hypothesis .",

    "there are constraints on the spins that can meet at any vertex . in this article , kinematic states",
    "will also be assumed to be a labelled network .",
    "however , the kinds of labels used will differ from loop quantum gravity . ]",
    "thus , the kinematics of a duct will be described by some discrete topological structure .",
    "inspired by loop quantum gravity ( fig .",
    "[ spinnet ] ) , i will suppose that space at one time can be described by quantum superpositions of labelled networks .",
    "unlike loop quantum gravity , however , the goal will not be to quantize a pre - existing classical theory , but rather to construct fully background - free quantum causal spacetime dynamics , using whatever structures are convenient for doing so .",
    "the dynamics of a duct consist of discrete steps in which the labelled network is modified by means of `` local replacement rules '' ( to be described in more detail below ) in which one portion of the network is replaced by another in some local region .",
    "these local replacement rules will be described by invertible unitary transformations @xmath2 defining the quantum mechanical transition amplitudes to go from one network state to another ( fig .",
    "[ replace ] ) .",
    "let a region that can be evolved forwards in time be called an `` initial evolution region '' ( ier ) , and let a region that can be evolved backwards in time be called a `` final evolution region '' ( fer ) . each unitary transformation",
    "@xmath2 will take the form of an operator going from a hilbert space of ier s to a hilbert space of fer s .",
    "$ ] . in order to conserve probability ,",
    "it is necessary that @xmath2 be unitary . ]",
    "those familiar with canonical quantum gravity should be aware of two differences with the formalism used here :    first , in a theory with discrete time , there is no hamiltonian operator @xmath1 .",
    "that is because the hamiltonian is defined as the generator of an infinitesimal time translation , and there is no such thing as an infinitesimal time translation if time proceeds by discrete steps only . instead , the collection of invertible unitary transformations @xmath2 will play the role of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "there will be one @xmath2 matrix for every kind of @xmath3 transition permitted by the theory .",
    "( since the domain and the target of @xmath2 are two distinct vector spaces , it does not make sense to talk about eigenvalues of @xmath2 . )",
    "second , since time evolution is a gauge symmetry , @xmath2 will be regarded as expressing an exact physical equivalence between the initial and final states related by the unitary transformation . in other words ,",
    "the physical hilbert space will be constructed by modding out all vectors of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is any state in the domain of @xmath2 .",
    "this is different from the usual picture in which the physical hilbert space is realized by means of imposing the wheeler - de witt equation as a constraint .",
    "however , the two pictures are equivalent .",
    "one can go from one picture to the other simply by taking the dual of the vector space of states .",
    "let @xmath6 be the vector space of kinematic states , and let @xmath7 be the subspace satisfying some dynamical constraint @xmath8 .",
    "then the dual physical state space @xmath9 is a quotient space of the dual kinematic state space @xmath10 .",
    "this quotient is obtained by modding out by all dual vectors @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 = 0 for all @xmath13 in the kernel of the constraint @xmath14 .    the dual picture is convenient because it is not necessary to solve a complicated constraint in order to refer to a physical state .",
    "any kinematic state is also a dynamical state vector ( although it may end up being the zero vector ) .",
    "this article will use the dual picture exclusively .",
    "[ [ causal ] ] causal + + + + + +    in addition to all this , the universe is a parallel processing computer . in any relativistic theory such as general relativity or quantum field theory , there is a maximum speed of information propagation .",
    "consequently , spacelike separated objects can be evolved forwards in time independently of one another .",
    "this is closely related to the `` many - fingered time '' aspect of background independence mentioned above .",
    "attempts have been made to construct causal theories of quantum gravity by imposing a causal structure ( i.e. a partial ordering ) on the elements of discrete spacetime histories .",
    "for example , markopoulou and smolin @xcite construct a model in which a spin network evolves forwards in time by means of rules which causally propagate the spin information of the network . in this model ,",
    "time evolution rule is stated as a rule for evolving an entire _ global _ spin - network @xmath15 forwards in time everywhere to a `` successor '' spin - network @xmath16 .",
    "this means that unlike general relativity , the theory is not fully background free , because it is formulated in a way which relies on an absolute notion of simultaneity .",
    "thus there is no local time - translation symmetry , no many - fingered time , and no hamiltonian constraint .",
    "markopoulou @xcite generalizes the preceding model by permitting arbitrary pachner moves to act on spin - networks",
    ". she also suggests generalizing the model to the `` non - maximal '' case in which not all spin - network vertices are evolved forwards in time on each time - step .",
    "the article claims that these modified models can be used to construct spacetimes which have a varying spacetime foliation .",
    "this is true in the sense that each individual spacetime has a causal structure which can be foliated in multiple ways by spacelike surfaces .",
    "but it is not clear that the model is still unitary and causal once one sums over different spacetime histories .",
    "hence it has not been shown that the dynamics are truly invariant under reparameterizing time as a function of space .",
    "as the article states , `` implementing causality now involves finding the correct choices of these amplitudes , which at this stage is an unsolved problem '' .",
    "@xcite for additional attempts to impose a causal structure for spin foam models .    similarly , the `` causal dynamical triangulations '' approach of ambjorn and loll @xcite requires histories to be causal in the sense that each classical history admits a causal structure .",
    "however , despite claims that this formalism is background free , the theory has built into it a preferred notion of spatial simultaneity . unlike general relativity , their construction privileges one particular foliation of spacetime into spatial slices .",
    "consequently , it does not qualify as background free in the sense used here .    in the `` causal set '' approach to quantum gravity @xcite",
    ", spacetime is assumed to be nothing but a partially ordered set of events .",
    "causal sets have _ only _ a discrete causal structure , which despite its discreteness appears to be compatible with lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "although it is possible to define causal quantum theories living on fixed causal sets @xcite , there does not yet exist a fully background - free quantum dynamics _ of _ the causal set .",
    "furthermore , since the notion of an `` initial data slice '' appears to be absent in this approach , it may be difficult to reconstruct notions of states and observables .    for the reasons stated above , none of the above models can yet be regarded as fully satisfactory implementations of quantum causality . indeed , there are some important obstacles to constructing a truly causal discrete theory of spacetime .",
    "the reason i have been at pains to emphasize the computational model of quantum gravity , is that these obstacles are already well - known and have names in the theory of parallel computation ! in computer science , these obstacles go by the names of _ race conditions _ and _",
    "deadlock_.    a computer with a parallel processor can run algorithms more quickly by splitting the work up into pieces and assigning them to independent processes called `` threads '' .",
    "however , problems can arise when the threads fail to be truly independent of each other .",
    "a `` race condition '' occurs when two threads require conflicting access to the same computing resource  such as a bit of information @xmath17 stored in a computer .",
    "for example , if thread a executes an instruction to read whether @xmath17 is 0 or 1 , and thread b executes an instruction to toggle the bit from 0 to 1 , then it matters which thread happens to execute its instruction first .",
    "this is regarded as undesirable because the goal of an algorithm is to calculate a specific answer in a reliable fashion .",
    "the answer should not depend on which of the two purportedly independent threads happens to execute first .",
    "in quantum gravity , the analogy to threading is that at any given time , there are multiple replacement operations which can act on the spacetime independently ( fig . [ threads ] ) . in such cases",
    ", it makes no difference which transition happens `` first '' ; one can perform them in either order .",
    ", in which the arrows represent mutually exclusive histories , each with its own quantum amplitude . ) ]    by contrast , a race condition occurs when two possible replacement rules act on overlapping regions in space ( fig .",
    "[ race ] ) . in such situations",
    ", it makes a difference which operation happens `` first '' .",
    "but in quantum gravity there is no notion of absolute time to decide which of the events does happen first .",
    "since time itself arises as a result of the interactions of the discrete units , there is no way to resolve the question of which event happens first , and the quantum gravity model is inconsistent with causality .",
    "different overlapping ier s and each is equally likely , then each must be assigned a probability of @xmath18 to occur .",
    "but this introduces an element of acausality since the evolution inside of an ier now depends on @xmath19 , which depends on information outside of the ier .",
    "hence there would no longer be well - defined causal domains of dependence . ]",
    "( for a discussion of this issue in the context of a classical model of networks evolving by means of replacement rules , see wolfram @xcite . )",
    "an analogous problem arises in the context of canonical quantum gravity , if the constraint algebra fails to close .",
    "this would result in the hamiltonian constraint eliminating too many degrees of freedom .",
    "the basic problem is that two different ways of evolving a spatial slice forwards in time need to give the same answer , i.e. their commutator must vanish up to a gauge - equivalence .",
    "this is a highly nontrivial problem in loop quantum gravity , whose solution is still unclear @xcite .",
    "according to perez @xcite , all known formulations of the hamiltonian constraint in which the constraint algebra closes are `` ultralocal '' in the sense of smolin @xcite , meaning that information does not propagate from vertex to vertex .",
    "this problem can be resolved in the case of a `` perfect action '' for which the transition amplitudes are the same ( up to gauge symmetry ) regardless of which replacement rule acts first @xcite .",
    "this is the situation for three dimensional loop quantum gravity , which has no local degrees of freedom , and is closely related to a topological chern - simons field theory @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the spin - foam amplitudes are independent of the choice of triangulation ( which is therefore regarded as a gauge symmetry ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this approach can be extended to theories with local degrees of freedom , such as general relativity in @xmath20 , since it would require the evolution rules to satisfy a complicated set of consistency relationships .",
    "another proposed solution is the `` master constraint program '' @xcite in which the infinitely many constraints of gr are replaced with a single master constraint , which is an integral of the squares of the lapse and shift constraints .",
    "this ensures that the constraints close , but at the price of obscuring the property of foliation independence .",
    "although classically the master constraint formalism is equivalent to general relativity , quantum mechanically there may be anomalies and so it is desirable to have a formalism in which the foliation independence is manifest .",
    "the duct models presented here will solve this problem in a different way .",
    "the dynamical evolution rules will be required to have non - overlapping transitions only .",
    "hence the ambiguity never arises , because the evolution rules at one moment of time all commute with each other trivially .",
    "this allows the time evolution rules of the duct to be unitary , causal , and many - fingered . as a result",
    "one can explicitly prove that the space of states is gauge - degenerate under lapse diffeomorphisms ( section [ degen ] ) , which is an unsolved problem in the spin foam approach @xcite .",
    "in multithreaded programming , the problem of race conditions is resolved by carefully defining the rules for what each thread can do , in such a way that no conflicts can occur .",
    "for example , a thread might place a `` lock '' on certain bits of information , that only it can access , until it has finished with them .    in quantum gravity",
    ", one can accomplish this by adding additional rules so as to specify which vertices are allowed to interact next .",
    "in such a model , the laws of physics would designate certain kinds of network regions as ier s , and other kinds as fer s .",
    "the basic consistency rule is that no two ier s can overlap lest future time evolution be indeterminate . nor can two fer s overlap , lest past evolution be indeterminate .",
    "there is , however , no problem if an ier and a fer overlap ( in fact they had better sometimes overlap , if information is to propagate from place to place ) .",
    "it is difficult to find reasonable rules for writing down ier s and fer s for spin - network states .",
    "for this reason , i will consider a networks labelled by a different kind of structure ( this structure could be either instead of , or in addition to , the spin labels ) : let each vertex be labelled with a `` future arrow '' , which points in the direction of one of its edges .",
    "an ier could then consist of a pair of adjacent vertices whose arrows point towards each other ( fig . [ happycouple ] ) .",
    "this guarantees that the ier s can never overlap with one another .",
    "the framework can be extended by allowing certain vertices to `` point to themselves '' , i.e. to evolve on their own as a one - vertex ier .",
    "similarly , each vertex must also be labelled with a `` past arrow '' degree of freedom which determines the fer s .",
    "unfortunately , this rule for defining ier s and fer s immediately leads to a new problem .",
    "what if a bunch of vertices point to each other in a loop ( fig .",
    "[ deadlock ] ) , so that no pairs are possible ?",
    "if the arrows point in random directions on a network , this sort of situation should arise frequently .",
    "in mutithreaded programming this is known as deadlock , and occurs when some set of threads are waiting for each other before they can continue . as a result , the program grinds to a halt . in computer programming",
    "this is bad because the program is not supposed to quit before it outputs the answer to the problem .    in quantum gravity ,",
    "on the other hand , deadlock would mean that time comes to an end , after which no future evolution is possible .",
    "under the right circumstances , this _ could _ be an accurate description a final singularity or a cauchy horizon , either of which would prevent further evolution .",
    "as long as the deadlocked region is shielded from the outside by a horizon ( cosmic censorship ) , time evolution could continue to occur in other regions of the universe .",
    "but apart from strongly gravitating regions , it is important that time should not be able to come to an end ( except perhaps with very small probability ) .",
    "otherwise why are we still here ?    can an evolution rule be found which is not so conducive to deadlock ?",
    "one simple solution can be shown to remove all deadlock from the previous example . whenever the future arrows point in a loop as in fig .",
    "[ deadlock ] , just take that set of vertices composing the loop to be an ier ( and similarly for the past arrow and fer s ) .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that the domains of dependence for causality can be arbitrarily large ; evolution is not confined to nearest - neighbor interactions . thus although causality is preserved , the theory is only quasi - local .",
    "the advantage is that the causal domains never overlap , and for any finite closed network there is at least one such region .",
    "thus in the attempt to construct a theory of quantum gravity with good causality , one is naturally led to a picture in which spacetime is filled with closed string - like causal entities , along which information can instantly propagate . nevertheless , there is still many - fingered time , since time has one `` finger '' for every causal string in existence at a given time .",
    "if these strings have a characteristic size on the order of the planck length , then one would presumably recover a more `` point - like '' causal structure at much larger distances .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows : section [ kin ] will more precisely define the kinematics of a discrete unitary causal theory ( duct ) .",
    "section [ dyn ] will define the unitary dynamics of the theory using a sum over histories approach , paying careful attention to the action of spacetime diffeomorphims on the feynman rules of the theory .",
    "section [ ip ] will discuss the properties of this inner product . in order to obtain a physical hilbert space @xmath7 for some region in the universe",
    ", one needs this inner product to be a ) hermitian , b ) highly degenerate ( so as to identify the same `` state '' at different `` times '' as gauge - equivalent ) c ) positive , and d ) finite .",
    "the first two conditions will be shown to hold for all duct models .",
    "positivity will be shown for any region of the universe which had a first moment of time .",
    "no general proof of finiteness will be given ; in my view this is likely to depend on the specific properties of the model .",

    "appendix [ cycle ] will discuss quantum interference effects for spacetimes whose histories are cyclical ( i.e. periodic ) in time .",
    "it will be argued that unless there is a nonzero probability to break out of the cycle , generically there are no dynamical states corresponding to such cyclic histories .",
    "one can define a `` basis state '' @xmath21 of a time slice to consist of a network ( with arbitrary valency ) consisting of a finite set @xmath22 of vertices , and a set @xmath23 of symmetric edges , each of which is connects two vertices ( or connects a vertex to itself ) , such that each vertex is equipped with a `` future arrow '' @xmath24 and a `` past arrow '' @xmath25 , each of which points either ( a ) along an edge of @xmath22 towards an adjacent vertex or ( b ) to the vertex itself . in this article",

    "one finds that the inner product is not preserved unless the norm - squared of the symmetrical states such as @xmath37 is doubled relative to the norm - squared of the asymmetrical states such as @xmath42 .",

    "one can also define basis states and the kinematic inner product for network regions with a boundary @xmath46 containing some number of external edges .",
    "the procedure is exactly the same except that the automorphism group should be restricted to symmetries which do not affect the boundary",

    "the ier s and fer s can be grouped into `` boundary classes '' based on the total number of edges connecting the ier or fer to the rest of the network .",

    "compatibility between ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) requires that the factors of @xmath32 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 be included in these inner products ; otherwise the proof of gauge degeneracy found in section [ degen ] will not work .",
    "the next step is to introduce the invertible unitary transformations @xmath2 which will be used to evolve one network into the other by substituting ier s for fer s , and vice versa ( section [ transit ] ) .",
    "these unitary transformations can then be used to construct a sum - over - histories formalism . by choosing the right feynman rules for the theory ,",
    "the inner product between any two states can be constructed ( section [ rules ] ) . even if the sum over histories is not absolutely convergent",
    ", one may still obtain good results if abel resummation is possible ( section [ resum ] ) .    in loop quantum gravity ,",
    "the sum over histories is normally derived from the hamiltonian constraint by the procedure known as `` group averaging '' or the `` rigging map '' @xcite .",
    "this strategy will not be used in what follows . instead , the feynman rules will be postulated to satisfy certain causality constraints and symmetry equivalences . like group averaging",
    ", these rules will have the consequence of restricting the space of kinematic states to a much smaller dynamical hilbert space .",
    "( because i am working with the dual space of states , this reduction is given not by projecting onto a constraint , but by modding out pure gauge vectors , but the principle is the same . )",

    "because there is a nonzero amplitude at each time - step for each state to leave the cyclic history when evolved backwards ( or forwards ) in time , and because these additional states can be taken to be initial ( or terminal ) respectively , the projection operator @xmath130 onto initial ( or terminal ) states equals the identity .      even away from the classical limit",
    ", similar behavior should appear whenever periodicity is inevitable , due to the system having only a finite number of states to explore .",
    "for example , if one were to chose the unitary evolution matrices @xmath2 such that the total number of vertices were conserved ( while preventing deadlock ) . in such cases , for generic choices of the couplings",
    "there will be _ no _ physical states , since all states will eventually evolve to themselves times a nontrivial phase .    as a particularly simple example , consider a duct with just one vertex , equipped with a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath239 , and a unitary evolution operator @xmath240 .",
    "one can choose a basis in which @xmath2 is diagonal . by performing the sum over histories in this basis",
    ", one finds that the inner product for each basis state is given by eq .",

    "if one evaluates this theory in the basis in which @xmath2 is diagonal , one can find the norm of each basis state using eq .",
    "( [ damp ] ) .",
    "since there are no histories which mix the basis states , different basis states are orthogonal , and the inner product is @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the phase of @xmath2 evaluated in the basis state @xmath27 .",
    "what if the inner product is evaluated in a different basis , such that @xmath2 is not diagonal ?",
    "one would like the answer to be just eq .",
    "( [ delt ] ) rotated into the new basis .",
    "in fact , the sum over histories is no longer absolutely convergent in the new basis .",
    "recall that in order for a series to be absolutely convergent , the sum of the absolute values of the squares must converge .",
    "but in the case of a nondiagonal unitary operator , @xmath245 which implies that the absolute sum over all amplitudes grows exponentially with time .",
    "this means that the sum over histories is not absolutely convergent even when @xmath105 is slightly less than 1 .",
    "nevertheless , by adding up the histories in the right order ( performing the sum over all histories with a given @xmath74 before summing over @xmath74 ) , one gets the right answer .",
