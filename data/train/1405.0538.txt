    "while studying the evolution of social network analysis research@xcite , it is clearly observed that at the beginning researchers focused on analysing multiple static@xcite or aggregated networks .",
    "they have provided very challenging set of research problems closely related to graph theory : computation of betweenness centrality measure@xcite based on shortest paths in the network@xcite or group discovery methods@xcite by using clique finding algorithms@xcite . due to computational complexity limitations ,",
    "most of the dynamic processes analysed in the networks were modelled on basic , static network structures .",
    "an alternative approach , recently extensively explored , are temporal networks , i.e. networks that reflect the occurrence of events in time@xcite and changes in their sets of nodes and edges .",
    "moreover , the network structural dynamics may also be reflected in other dynamic processes , such as information diffusion or spread of influence .",
    "these processes can be strongly influenced by appearing and disappearing nodes and their dynamic relationships and this complex phenomena attracted more and more researchers worldwide .",
    "a simple proof for that is the number of full text articles containing the term `` temporal social networks '' in scientific databases , e.g. in scopus , this number has been increasing on average by about 35% every year since 2005 .",
    "the approach to network dynamics with the highest granularity is a separate consideration of each individual event log resulting in changes in the network structure . in such case , each edge in the network must be timestamped and may overlap with many other edges for other time points .",
    "this idea , however , is the most computational and storage demanding , so to overcome its limitations , two main network aggregation types may be applied : static and temporal .",
    "the former is very popular and quite simple : all recorded events are aggregated into a single static network , e.g. if two users exchanged at least one email any time over last two years , they are treated as mutually connected acquaintances . in this paper , such concept",
    "will be further called _ a static approach _ since it losses the temporal nature of timestamped events . some recent research",
    "have revealed that this may result in misleading conclusions about the outcomes of dynamic processes@xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the social spreading phenomenon is very dependent on the timing of contacts@xcite . as a result of these findings",
    ", the research can turn towards temporal networks that only partially aggregate events and provide a number of time - ordered networks ; each merges events for a particular period - time frame .",
    "this approach , which may be considered as a trade - off between working with the static network and event log .",
    "it facilitates benefiting from all the achievements of graph theory but it simultaneously results with less storage requirements and computational complexity than raw event log processing .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyse how the results of one of the typical models of spread of influence - linear threshold@xcite - differ depending on the strategy of building the social network used later for choosing seeds . to show the impact of network building strategy on spread of influence results",
    "three kinds of approaches were studied : one static and two temporal .",
    "these concepts were also utilized in experimental verification on five empirical datasets .",
    "for all of the networks , the authors used the most popular heuristics for choosing initial seeds for spread of influence based on network measures and they observed the results of the process . additionally , some new heuristics were proposed , which consider the role of time in evaluating nodes as potential seeds .",
    "apart from empirical studies on the spread of influence@xcite , a number of theoretical models of this process were proposed and widely studied .",
    "these include among others : linear threshold model lt@xcite , independent cascade model ic@xcite or the voter model vm@xcite .",
    "each of them introduces different approaches of modelling the process .",
    "for instance , linear threshold model is oriented on the percentage of influenced neighbours of a node , while independent cascade model introduces the probabilities of influencing nodes assigned to node which is already influenced .",
    "these principles of social propagation mechanisms were presented in@xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting research questions is the problem of maximising the final spread of influence as defined by kempe et al.@xcite .",
    "they considered the question , which nodes should be chosen for a particular spreading model to maximize the overall number of influenced nodes . due to the fact that the problem is np - hard for most models , so far , only some heuristics were proposed based on different approaches and various initial assumptions .",
    "in@xcite the authors studied how to select initial nodes in an independent cascade model based on the static graph and the previous propagation logs , which were assumed to be known a priori . some other scalable algorithms for finding seeds for the lt model",
    "were suggested in@xcite and@xcite , while maximising the spread for the ic model was considered in@xcite .",
    "since most of the studies were devoted to lt and ic models , it is also worth to mention about some research on maximising the spread of influence in the voter model@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , an interesting approach was presented in@xcite , where other versions of the problem were analysed : minimising the time of the spread of influence or minimising the budget for finding seeds .",
    "it is worth to mention that some researchers also try to overcome the limitations of basing just on the graph structure to find influential nodes .",
    "however again , most of these approaches operate on a static view of the social network , which is the strong simplification of the reality , even when considering multiple layers@xcite .",
    "in@xcite authors use historical data to calculate the propagations probabilities , however the limitation of this method is that this historical data should be known in advance .",
    "masuda and holme stated , while studying epidemic processes@xcite , that the static approach of the network epidemiology may miss a great deal of what happens in the long - term reality , since the nodes contact each other only in particular time windows . similarly , gomez - rodriguez et al.@xcite confirmed that relaxing the assumption of static propagation network would be an interesting case for further research in the area of spread of influence .",
    "kossinets and watts also emphasized the importance of time in analysing the processes in social networks@xcite .",
    "having these conclusions in mind , it was decided to evaluate how the most typical heuristics based on the network structure perform on temporal and static networks .",
    "a special attention has been turned to observation of dynamics of the influence that spreads over temporal ( changing ) network after choosing initial seed sets . indeed , this direction is emerging , because first work studying spreading phenomenon in temporal networks is published nowadays@xcite .",
    "however , the authors did not focus on seeding strategies there , but they analysed the process under different assumptions for the aggregation level .",
    "let us consider spread of influence within the framework of temporal social network .",
    "a temporal social network ( tsn ) consists of interval graphs @xmath0 , where graph nodes and edges correspond to nodes social common activity in a given interval out of the set of intervals @xmath1 , @xmath2 called time windows .",
    "the parentheses @xmath3 indicate the period of activity , the unprimed time marks the beginning of the window and the primed quantity denotes its end@xcite .",
    "there exists an edge @xmath4 in a particular interval graph @xmath5 , @xmath6 if and only if there exists a social relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath3 time window . due to the fact that there might appear multiple events ( common social activities ) between @xmath7 and @xmath8 within a single time window @xmath9",
    ", the relationship is obtained by aggregation of these events .",
    "therefore , each interval graph @xmath5 can be treated as a static graph .    each interval graph @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is composed of a set of nodes @xmath10 and a set of directed edges @xmath11 representing relations between nodes in time window @xmath9 : @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the set of directly neighbouring and potentially influencing nodes , i.e. nodes with relation to node @xmath14 in window @xmath9 : @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , the set @xmath13 is composed of individuals who can potentially influence node @xmath7 in time window @xmath9 .",
    "it is assumed that before the spread of influence ( before time window @xmath16 ) , a subset of individuals @xmath17 is selected as the seed for the influence spread . by @xmath18 , we denote a set of all nodes that had been observed in the network before an influence spread was considered .",
    "the set @xmath19 should represent a group of individuals who have already been influenced as well as the set of promoters who have certain social , economic and/or political abilities to influence others .",
    "we assume that the initial seed set adopts all influence before observed spread starts . at the following time window @xmath20 ,",
    "an individual @xmath21 will be really influenced if at least @xmath22 $ ] fraction of its neighbours are in the seed set , i.e.    @xmath23    it means that set @xmath24 consists of all nodes who have been exposed to the influence , are persuaded by their neighbours and adopted the influence in period @xmath20 .    in general , for a given @xmath25 ,",
    "a not - yet - influenced node @xmath26 will be influenced in the @xmath27th window @xmath28 , if    @xmath29    finally , we obtain a list of nodes influenced in the following periods : @xmath30 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : kthinfluencestep ] ) , the final set of influenced nodes @xmath31 depends on two crucial factors : initial seed set @xmath19 and the dynamics of consecutive interval graphs @xmath5 for @xmath32 stating the influencing neighbourhoods @xmath13 for each node @xmath7 in the consecutive periods .",
    "regardless the propagation model used for spread of influence , the seed selection strategy determines the final number of influenced nodes in the network .",
    "given the temporal social network @xmath33 that consists of @xmath34 interval graphs , the goal is to select initial seed set of nodes @xmath19 of size @xmath35 @xmath36 in order to maximize the final number of influenced nodes after the @xmath34th window @xmath37 in the influence propagation process , see eq .",
    "[ eq : argmax ] .",
    "@xmath38    due to the fact that the final set of influenced nodes @xmath31 depends on initial seed set @xmath19 and the interval graphs @xmath5 for @xmath32 , its exact estimation is highly complex . under the lt propagation model",
    ", it has been already shown to be np - hard@xcite .",
    "the real setting of influence spread problem might be much more complicated . in real world applications , it can be expected to select seeds using historical knowledge about nodes activity . in this case",
    "the information about past activity of nodes may become an advantage , because , for instance , recently inactive nodes may be omitted from the seeds set improving general results .",
    "still , the dynamics of the complex networks introduces completely new problems in comparison to the static approach .",
    "in particular , we would need to address the following problems :    * as the activity of nodes may differ , even highly active nodes may become inactive just after the moment of seed selection .",
    "if a node is chosen as a seed , it is expected that it will be active also later on , which may be not necessarily true leading to wasting the marketing campaign budget .",
    "* after the initial influencing moment , the increasing dynamics of the network in terms of appearing new nodes may minimize the expected influence of old nodes chosen as seeds .",
    "* due to the fact that the network dynamics also includes changes in edges , it may happen that kind of dynamics may be either helpful or harmful , i.e. influential nodes meet not previously expected non - influenced nodes , but it may also lead to undesirable outcomes - the expected node behaviour ( high susceptibility to influences or high ability to influence others ) may not necessarily be valid any more .    in fact ,",
    "the above mentioned problems could be solved , if the link prediction solutions@xcite would foresee new links with acceptable level of accuracy .",
    "this , in turn , could enable development of completely new seeding methods for dynamic networks , yet , still there is a lot of research to be performed before it comes true .",
    "the main problem investigated in this paper is how to select initial set of nodes that next could influence others in the most efficient way .",
    "the efficiency is here measured by the number of finally influenced nodes .",
    "the main assumption introduced here is that the social network , in which the influence spreads is dynamic , i.e. nodes and social relationships may both appear and disappear .",
    "this dynamic phenomena of the network may significantly influence the final outcome .    for that reason ,",
    "the main research question one may ask is whether this dynamics existing during the spread , may be also somehow included in the seeding process .",
    "the authors intuition is that it can be done by means of usage of dynamics observed for the same community but in the previous periods - in the past . in other words , if we have some knowledge about changes in the network in the past period @xmath39 , we would like to create a better seed that would enable us to influence more nodes in the dynamic network in the future @xmath40 , see also fig .  [",
    "fig : threekinds ] . the general problem considered in that context is what kind of networks should we use to perform better in seeding and finally in the spread outcome .",
    "two main network kinds have been further studied : static one that aggregates equally all knowledge from the past ( @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : threekinds ] ) and temporal one that splits the past period into more or less time intervals : @xmath42 with 10 equal time windows and @xmath43 with 5 time frames .",
    "the temporal approach corresponds to dynamic context of seeding , whereas an aggregated social network reflects typical static seeding circumstances .    ) .",
    "the seed - set @xmath19 of initially influenced nodes is used to spread of influence in the dynamic social network in the future ( in time @xmath40 ) .",
    "three kinds of learning social networks used in the experiments on seed selection are depicted one below another : @xmath44 with 10 time windows , @xmath45 with 5 time frames , @xmath46 - aggregated - static ( one time window ) . ]    additionally , various methods for node rankings were considered .",
    "all of them were based on different structural network measures but for temporal networks diverse forgetting methods were applied to respect new knowledge more than old one , see section [ sec : taxmes ] .",
    "note that the temporal approach provides a unique chance to utilize dynamics of the social network observed in the past .",
    "if this dynamics ( kinds and speed of changes ) is to some extent similar in the future , the time - sensitive seeding may potentially deliver better results .",
    "efficient seeding is very important in the real world , especially in marketing campaigns - the proper selection of initial customers may significantly increase the future sell .",
    "first , we introduce three simple aggregations , which allows us to order users based on structural measures ( total degree , in - degree , out - degree , betweenness , closeness ) respecting all periods in the temporal social network in the accumulated way .",
    "if we consider the @xmath47 as a value of a given structural measure @xmath35 ( e.g in - degree ) of particular node @xmath7 in the @xmath9th time interval ( @xmath32 ) , several unnormalized aggregated measures respecting temporal aspects of node s activity in all consecutive periods can be defined as follows :    * maximum @xmath48 * minimum @xmath49 * sum @xmath50    the above aggregations , however , do not make use of sequential nature of time and general phenomena that recent social relationships are likely to be more influential than old ones .",
    "hence , the authors have introduced nine new aggregations that take into account also the `` forgetting '' aspect of time i.e. the value of a given structural measure in the most recent time window is the most important , while the measures value in the oldest period is the least valuable .",
    "the purpose of this , was not only to capture the dynamics of user behaviour but also to emphasize users latest activities .",
    "these new aggregations are defined in the following way :    * maximum logarithm @xmath51 * minimum logarithm @xmath52 * sum of logarithms @xmath53 * maximum power @xmath54 * minimum power @xmath55 * sum of powers @xmath56 * linear forgetting @xmath57 * hyperbolic forgetting @xmath58 * exponential forgetting @xmath59    all the aggregations combined with all typical node structural measures ( in - degree , out - degree , total degree , betweenness and closeness ) where used to create node rankings and select the seed set for spreading the influence . however , only few of them really provided reasonable and distinct results .",
    "finally , only six best and most representative combinations of measures and their temporal aggregation were analysed in - depth :    * in - degree ( inexp ) and out - degree ( outexp ) with exponential forgetting , eq .",
    "[ eq : expforgetting ] , * total degree with logarithmic forgetting ( totlog ) , eq .",
    "[ eq : sumlog ] , * betweenness with hyperbolic forgetting ( bethyp ) , eq .",
    "[ eq : hypforgetting ] , * closeness with power forgetting ( clopow ) , eq .",
    "[ eq : sumpower ] ,    see section [ seedselection ] and [ sec : temporalvsaggregated ] for additional details .    in other words , nodes in the temporal social network from the past were ranked according to the time - aggregated values of their structural measures and this aggregation was performed for all component networks used for seeding , see the left part of fig .  [ fig : threekinds ] .",
    "next , some top ranked nodes were used for seeding , see the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig : threekinds ] .",
    "it means that these top nodes form the initial set @xmath19 of already influenced nodes that may influence others in the following periods , see the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : threekinds ] .",
    "the experiments were conducted using five real - world social networks representing the communication between company employees or social services users ( table [ tab : datasets ] ) .",
    "all of them were extracted from communication datasets downloaded from the koblenz network collection ( konect ) repository .",
    "each social network has timestamped edges , so it allowed to perform temporal analysis .",
    "the properties of the datasets are presented in table [ tab : datasets ] .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : nemenyi ]      results reveal that indeed for the aggregated ( static ) network , i.e. @xmath60 , the total number of the influenced nodes is the lowest ( the right group of bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : allresults ] ) and the best performing network type is the one with the biggest number of time windows , i.e. @xmath42 - the left hand side group of bars , fig .  [",
    "fig : allresults ] .",
    "overall , the final number of influenced nodes for the 10-windows networks ( @xmath42 ) was about double as much as for a single network @xmath60 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : allresults ] .",
    "it confirms our initial hypothesis that using dynamic network we are able to better utilize the information in original data and finally select better seeds .",
    "what is more , the greater granularity , the better chance to choose the proper seeds , especially if taking time into consideration by means of time - dependent measures , such as based on linear forgetting . when trying to explain this phenomenon , once again the intuition is suggesting that the increasing granularity is helpful in terms of better representation of the network dynamics , so the sensitivity of the introduced measures increases  they reflect dynamics to a greater extent .",
    "as studies@xcite show , the network dynamics is very prone to the size of the time window , so in this case the more detailed representation of facts the better , because very short and intensive actions , such as bursts , will be captured and represented better , without being averaged by longer time periods .    .",
    "for the presentation purpose links for ten time windows of the influence ( evaluation ) process were aggregated to show the complete link structure , not just the single window . ]",
    "coming back to the results , we have noticed that out - degree - based measures ( outexp ) are performing better than others . to give more in - depth explanation ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the basics of the lt model .",
    "it is worth to remember , that in directed social networks a person becomes influenced if a fraction of neighbours contacting with them is already influenced .",
    "it results with the situation that a node with the high out - degree becomes an influencer for the high number of nodes ; these nodes have most probably a small degree . on the other hand ,",
    "if we look at the betweenness ( bethyp ) , its high value means that there are a lot of shortest paths going through that node , so it could be a bridge connecting two or more parts of the network .",
    "however , this might not be enough when we are using the lt model , since the node may have only few neighbours .",
    "of course , such a node could be essential , if one part of the network tends to influence another one and that is why the betweenness - based measures also achieved quite good results in experiments .",
    "the question for discussion and future work is whether those two measures ( out - degree and betweenness ) should not be somehow combined to create even better ranking for seed selection .",
    "taking into account all time windows , the average exchange of neighbours of the chosen seeds was more than three times higher than for the random seeds , see table [ tab : neighchange ] .",
    "it leads to the conclusion that the high values of the outexp measure over all time frames was obtained not by constant intense contacts with the same group of nodes over long time , but by exchanging the dense neighbourhoods from window to window as well  they quite frequently swapped the neighbours . as a result , during the influence part , these nodes were able to influence new neighbours in consecutive time windows giving better final results .",
    "the in - depth analysis of the position of seeds also revealed that in all datasets , these nodes were located not on boundaries of the network , but close to its center .",
    "moreover , these seeds were rarely located close to each other , see figure  [ fig : network ] .",
    "selection of nodes that are initially influenced and next are used to influence the others in the social community ( seeding ) is one of the essential problems in analysis of spread of influence . in the real world",
    ", social networks continuously evolve and change their node and connection set contents .",
    "a proper choice of the most promising nodes becomes extremely difficult in such dynamic environment .",
    "the main goal of this paper was to confront static context of seeding against dynamic one . in the static approach , the social network used for seeding aggregates all data from the past in the form of the single social network .",
    "a new idea introduced in this paper  a temporal context  enables , in turn , to respect network dynamics observed in the past and make use of it for seeding and spread of influence within the temporal social network in the future .",
    "this unique concept is based on calculation of structural measures for a series of historical networks , having also in mind the sequential nature of time . as a result ,",
    "the most recent network snapshots influence the final node ranking more than the older ones .",
    "this time - dependent ranking in a sense encapsulates the past dynamics of the social network .",
    "the experimental studies performed on five real data sets on human communication facilitated creation of both static and temporal social networks used for seeding .",
    "the raw results as well as statistical tests have revealed the crucial paper finding : better results ( more influenced people ) may be achieved if seeding is carried out on known temporal social networks rather than in the static environment .",
    "moreover , the higher granularity of periods in the network , the greater outcome and it has been observed for almost all cases .",
    "the final number of influenced nodes for the 10-windows networks was about double as much as for the single network .",
    "additionally , various time - dependent structural measures were also analysed .",
    "the experiments have shown that out - degree node measure with exponential forgetting performed best for most contexts . in only one dataset - enron ,",
    "the betweenness measure with hyperbolic forgetting was the best .",
    "all the above new findings are quite coherent for all data sets analysed , which represent different public available social networks , see table [ tab : datasets ] and have been confirmed by statistical tests . however , we can not state that the general rules discovered in the paper will be valid for all data sets and all environments .",
    "we also encourage the other independent researchers and also practitioners to validate them for other measures , other data sets , other settings and other than linear threshold models for spread of influence .",
