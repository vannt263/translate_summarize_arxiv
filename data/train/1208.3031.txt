    "topological insulators ( tis ) are electronic materials that possess an insulating bulk gap and topologically - protected conducting states on their edges or surfaces @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 and related materials with gapless surface states@xcite , e.g. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , have recently attracted extensive attention in the condensed matter and device physics communities@xcite .",
    "thin ti films were proposed for application in the magnetic memory@xcite due to their extremely high surface - to - volume ratio@xcite .",
    "accordingly , a mechanical exfoliation method was developed for preparation of thin ti films with significant surface transport@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the two - dimensional version of topological insulators is also known as a quantum spin hall insulator , consisting of edge states that behave as perfect one - dimensional counterpropagating ( helical ) channels .",
    "these channels are well - localized along the edges , carry electrons with opposite spins , and are protected from nonmagnetic impurity scattering by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the peculiar properties of the helical edge states have been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally in @xmath3 quantum wells @xcite , and have been predicted to exist in various other materials @xcite . due to the robust spin property of these edge channels , two - dimensional topological insulators are promising candidates for spintronic devices .    in any future spintronic device , it is desirable to achieve electrical ( rather than magnetic field ) manipulation of spin transport .",
    "however , the robustness of the helical edge - state transport to nonmagnetic impurity scattering and local perturbation , means that it is not easy to electrically modulate the edge - state transport in ti - based devices .",
    "nonetheless , investigations into electrical control of edge channel transport in tis have gathered pace recently . for instance , due to the finite size effect @xcite , the inter - edge tunneling arising from the overlap between states from opposite edges can open up an energy gap , and modify the conductance of the system . the amplitude of the inter - edge tunneling is determined by the finite decay length of the helical edge states into the bulk @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon may provide a means to adjust the transport property of edge states , via finite size effect of the quantum point contact @xcite , interferometry of the edge states @xcite , and nanoscale engineering of the edge geometry , e.g. , by patterning a constriction in a hgte heterostructure  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we propose the design of a ti - based spintronics device which incorporates a two - dimensional topological insulator ( 2d - ti ) , e.g. a @xmath3 quantum well , contacted to two ferromagnetic leads .",
    "we shall focus on the electrical manipulation of the transport properties by inducing inter - edge tunneling through an electrically induced quantum point contact .",
    "this can be achieved by applying external voltage via a pair of split gate along the transverse direction of the device .",
    "we apply the nonequilibrium keldysh green s function method to calculate the charge current flowing through the ti - based device .",
    "it is found that conductance of such device can be significantly enhanced by the presence of inter - edge spin - flip tunneling when the leads are highly spin asymmetric and their magnetizations are in the antiparallel configuration .",
    "thus , the proposed setup can potentially realize an electrically controlled ti device in which the conductance varies according to the inter - edge tunneling coupling and the magnetization configurations of the leads .",

    "[ fig : current1](a ) shows the effect of the spin - flip tunneling , characterized by the coefficient @xmath16 on the charge current as a function of magnetization orientation @xmath75 .",
    "the charge current decreases with increasing tunneling strength @xmath16 when @xmath102 , especially at @xmath99 [ the parallel configuration ] .",
    "however , there occurs an opposite trend , i.e. , the charge current can increase with increasing @xmath16 when @xmath103 .",
    "this is especially so when @xmath100 [ the anti - parallel configuration ] .",
    "the observed trend can be explained by considering the spin - state of electrons in the edge states . in the parallel configuration ,",
    "spin polarized electrons can flow through the central ti region along one of the edge channels in the absence of the inter - edge coupling .",
    "for instance , in the schematic diagram of fig . 1 , we find that when the magnetization of the leads are pointing in the @xmath5-direction , then most of the forward electron flux will flow in the top edge state . in the presence of inter - edge spin - flip coupling",
    ", however , some of the forward moving electrons in the upper edge will be scattered to the spin - down state in the lower edge .",
    "they will encounter a higher probability of being blocked at the right electrode since they are a minority carrier there . on the contrary , for the anti - parallel case",
    ", the current is suppressed in the absence of the inter - edge coupling . referring to figure 1 again ,",
    "let us assume that the magnetization of the left ( right ) leads are magnetized in the @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) direction .",
    "the forward spin - up flux in the top edge will be blocked at the right electrode as spin - up electrons are minority carriers there .",
    "the presence of inter - edge spin - flip coupling ( i.e. , finite @xmath16 ) enables the spin - up electron in the top edge to be scattered into the forward moving spin - down state in the lower edge . the spin - down electron will have a higher transmission into the right electrode as it will be a majority carrier in that electrode .",
    "thus , by utilizing the presence of spin - flip tunneling at the qpc , one can modulate the transport properties of this ti - based device for different magnetization configurations .    at the same time",
    ", the spin - conserving inter - edge tunneling coupling at the qpc induces the back - scattering process . since this can coexist with the spin - flip tunneling term , it is deservable to investigate the combined effect of these two terms on the charge current , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current1](b ) .",
    "when there exists only the spin - conserving tunneling , for example @xmath106 and @xmath107 [ red dashed line ] , the charge current is decreased by the tunneling term via the back - scattering process . in other words ,",
    "some of the forward moving electrons in the upper edge will be scattered to the backward moving spin - up states in the lower edge , thus decreasing the overall charge current .",
    "the reduction in current due to the back - scattering is greater for the parallel configuration than that for the antiparallel case .",
    "this is because the current reduction in the parallel case is mainly due to the back - scattering of majority spin carriers , and this involves more electrons than that of minority electrons in the anti - parallel case .    in the presence of both types of inter - edge tunnel coupling ,",
    "i.e. both the spin - flip and spin - conserving types , the net result will be suppression ( enhancement ) of charge current when the device is in the parallel ( antiparallel ) configuration . in the parallel configuration ,",
    "both the spin - flip and spin - conserving tunneling reduce the current , the former by scattering to the minority spin state , while the latter by backscattering .",
    "however , in the antiparallel configuration , the two inter - edge couplings have opposite effects @xmath108 the spin - flip ( spin - conserving ) process increases ( decreases ) the current .",
    "when the two are of equal strength , e.g. , @xmath109 , the spin - flip process dominates , and so there is a net increase in current in the antiparallel configuration [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : current1](b ) ] . the current suppression due to the spin - conserving tunneling also results in the cross - over between net enhancement and net suppression of charge current occurring at a large - angle configuration beyond @xmath110 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : current1](b ) ] .",
    "thus , the transport properties of our ti - based device can be effectively modulated by adjusting the relative strengths of the two types of inter - edge tunneling couplings across the qpc . in order to experimentally verify the above results",
    ", one must first prepare the hgte - based device with transverse width of at least @xmath111 nm , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] .",
    "for the two ferromagnetic leads , the magnetization of the left lead is fixed and pointed in the out - of - plane @xmath112 direction , while the right lead is made of a softer magnetic material , so that its magnetization direction can be changed from @xmath99 to @xmath100 with respect to the left lead , by application of a magnetic field .",
    "one can modulate the width of the qpc by using the gate voltage @xmath4 , which would in turn induce different tunneling strengths @xmath15 and @xmath16 , due to the finite overlap between edge states on the upper and the lower sides@xcite . by analyzing the voltage dependence of the charge current",
    ", one may determine the variation of the charge current as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "next , we analyze the charge current @xmath76 and the conductance @xmath69 of the ti - based device under varying bias voltage . in fig .  [",
    "fig : current2](a ) and ( b ) , the bias dependence of @xmath76 is plotted for different spin - flip coupling strengths @xmath16 , for the parallel @xmath113 , and antiparallel @xmath114 configurations . as noted earlier , for the parallel ( antiparallel ) configuration , * @xmath76 * decreases ( increases ) as @xmath16 increases .",
    "similarly , the bias dependence plot of @xmath69 also shows a decrease ( increase ) with increasing @xmath16 when @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , as shown in the upper insets of fig .",
    "3(a ) [ ( b ) ] .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that a finite @xmath16 would lead to coupling of two edge states with opposite spins , resulting in spin mixing and thus reducing the degree of spin asymmetry in the device .",
    "consequently , the tmr ratio decreases with increasing @xmath16 , as shown by the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : current2](b ) . for both configurations",
    ", the conductance also decreases with increasing bias voltage @xmath91 , with a larger decrease occurring for the parallel case .",
    "this translates to a slight decrease in tmr ratio with bias voltage @xmath91 for small coupling strength @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the conductance and the tmr of the ti - based device can be modulated by both the source - drain voltage @xmath91 , and the split - gate voltage @xmath4 , which alters the coupling strength @xmath16 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the transport of a two - dimensional topological insulator ( ti ) sandwiched between two ferromagnetic ( fm ) leads , and incorporating a quantum point contact ( qpc ) which couples the edge states along the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "the conductance across the device is calculated via the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method .",
    "we found that spin - flip tunnel coupling between the edge states mediated by the qpc can enhance ( suppress ) the current when the magnetization of the two fm leads is in the antiparallel ( parallel ) configuration . on the other hand",
    ", the spin - conserving tunnel coupling leads to backscattering which reduces the overall current regardless of the magnetization alignment of the fm leads .",
    "the conductance and tmr of the ti - based device can be controlled by both the source - drain voltage @xmath91 , as well as the split - gate voltage @xmath4 , the latter modifying the inter - edge coupling strengths across the qpc .",
    "our proposed device suggests a new class of ti - based devices which incorporate a qpc to electrically control the inter - edge coupling , so as to harness the topological and spin - polarized nature of the ti edge states for practical application .",

    "<S> the counterpropagating edge states of a two - dimensional topological insulator ( ti ) carry electrons of opposite spins . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the transport properties of edge states in a two - dimensional ti which is contacted to ferromagnetic leads . </S>",
    "<S> the application of a side - gate voltage induces a constriction or quantum point contact ( qpc ) which couples the two edge channels . </S>",
    "<S> the transport properties of the system is calculated via the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function method . </S>",
    "<S> we found that inter - edge spin - flip coupling can significantly enhance ( suppress ) the charge current when the magnetization of the leads are anti - parallel ( parallel ) to one another . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , spin - conserving inter - edge coupling generally reduces the current by backscattering regardless of the magnetization configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the charge current and the conductance as a function of the bias voltage , also exhibit similar trends with respect to spin - flip coupling strength , for both parallel and anti - parallel configurations . </S>",
    "<S> hence , gate voltage modulation of edge states via a qpc can provide a means of modulating the spin or charge current flow in ti - based spintronics devices . </S>"
