    "the hyades open cluster is one of the key calibrators of the absolute magnitude - spectral type relation and the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "the small distance to the cluster ( @xmath045  pc ) has a number of advantages for studies of its hertzsprung  russell diagram : ( i ) the foreground interstellar reddening and extinction is negligible ( @xmath2  mag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , ( ii ) the large proper motion ( @xmath3  mas  yr@xmath4 ) and peculiar space motion ( @xmath035  km  s@xmath4 ) facilitate proper motion- and radial velocity - based membership determinations , and ( iii ) the stellar content can be probed to low masses relatively easily . among the @xmath0400 known members are white dwarfs , red giants , mid - a stars in the turn - off region , and main - sequence stars",
    "down to at least @xmath0@xmath5 m dwarfs @xcite . at the same time , the proximity of the hyades complicates astrophysical interpretation : the tidal radius of @xmath010  pc corresponds to a significant depth along the line of sight . as a result , the precise definition and location of the main sequence and turn - off region in the hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram , and the accuracy of the determination of , e.g. , the helium content and age of the cluster , have always been limited by the measurement error of the distances to individual stars .",
    "even hipparcos parallax uncertainties translate into absolute magnitude errors of @xmath60.10  mag at the mean distance of the cluster , whereas @xmath7-band photometric errors only account for @xmath80.01  mag uncertainty for most members .",
    "it was realized long ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the small internal velocity dispersion of the hyades makes it possible to improve the trigonometric parallaxes of individual member stars by kinematic modelling of their proper motions .",
    "various recent studies derived such secular parallaxes for hyades members from hipparcos astrometry @xcite , but none investigated the resulting hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram in any detail .",
    "yet , as the relative proper motion accuracy is effectively three times larger than the relative trigonometric parallax accuracy , the secular parallaxes are three times more precise than the trigonometric parallaxes , and provide a unique opportunity to obtain a well - defined and absolutely calibrated hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram for an open cluster . for this reason",
    "we have redetermined the secular parallaxes for the hyades , using the comprehensive procedure described by @xcite ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we describe the full derivation of the secular parallaxes elsewhere ( * ? ? ?",
    "this includes a new analysis of the space motion and internal velocity dispersion of the hyades , a validation of the secular parallaxes , with a detailed investigation of the effect of velocity structure in the cluster and of the presence of small - angular - scale correlations in the hipparcos data , and an extensive analysis of the construction of the physical hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram @xmath9 .",
    "in the course of this work , we constructed a color - absolute magnitude diagram for a sample of high - fidelity single members of the hyades , and discovered that the improved accuracy reveals two turn - offs and associated gaps in the main sequence at the locations predicted by bhm ",
    "vitense , in the seventies .",
    "these are the topic of this letter .",
    "the hipparcos catalog ( esa 1997 ) contains about 200 members of the hyades brighter than @xmath11 ( @xcite ; bhz ) .",
    "we selected a high - fidelity subset of single members , defined as follows .",
    "we removed suspect kinematic members and stars which have known spectral peculiarities and hence deviant positions in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we excluded the stars beyond 40  pc from the cluster center ( for which membership is not particularly certain ) and all ( possible ) close double and multiple systems ( 98 spectroscopic binaries , hipparcos dmsa`g@xmath12o@xmath12v@xmath12x@xmath12s ' stars , and stars with suspect secular parallaxes ) .",
    "we also rejected 11 stars which are variable ( hipparcos field h52 is one of ` d@xmath12m@xmath12p@xmath12r@xmath12u ' ) or have large photometric errors ( @xmath13  mag ) , as well as the suspect stars hip 20901 , 21670 , and 20614 ( see bhz for further details ) .",
    "the final sample contains 90 single members which follow the main sequence from @xmath14  mag ( late - k / early - m dwarfs ; @xmath15 ) to @xmath16  mag ( a7iv stars ; @xmath17 ) , except for @xmath18 and @xmath19 tau , which are evolved red giants .",
    "we added the two components of the ` resolved spectroscopic binary ' @xmath20  tau as single stars .",
    "these are located in the turn - off region of the cluster , and bring the total number  of objects to  92 .",
    "we took the accurate values for @xmath1 and @xmath7 listed in the hipparcos catalog , and used the secular parallaxes to compute @xmath21 .",
    "figure  [ fig : camd ] shows the resulting color versus secular parallax - based absolute magnitude diagram for these 92 stars ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "it shows the giant clump , the turn - off region , and a well - defined and very narrow main sequence .",
    "the latter contains a few conspicuous but artificial gaps , e.g. , around @xmath22 and between @xmath23 and @xmath24 mag , caused by the suppression of ( double and multiple ) stars from our sample ( cf .",
    "figure 21 of * ? ? ?",
    "the small gap between @xmath25 and @xmath26 mag is also present in the original sample ( see figure 21 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is therefore probably real ( cf .",
    "figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "somewhat further to the blue , there are two turn - offs and associated gaps , near @xmath27 and @xmath0@xmath28  mag .",
    "these features are not clearly discernible in the lower - quality trigonometric parallax - based version of the same diagram ( figure 21 of * ? ? ?",
    "although their reality in the ` cleaned ' secular parallax colour - magnitude diagram is hard to establish beyond all doubt , the simultaneous existence of both a turn - off and an associated gap at a location which coincides with predictions made by stellar structure models ( see  3 ) strongly argues in favour of them being real .",
    "@xcite realized that convective atmospheres have relatively low temperatures in the deeper layers which contribute to the surface flux in the spectral regions of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 filters @xcite .",
    "as a result , convective atmospheres appear to be cooler , and therefore have @xmath1 colors that are reddened by amounts of @xmath00.070.12  mag when compared to radiative atmospheres of the same @xmath31 . as the reddening of the atmosphere",
    "is not accompanied by a significant change in luminosity , the onset of surface convection can therefore cause a turn - off and associated gap in the color - absolute magnitude diagram , starting around @xmath32@xmath33  mag ( figure  [ fig : bvgap ] ) .",
    "the precise location of this bhm  vitense gap depends on details of the stellar structure , including metallicity .",
    "we identify the turn - off and gap at @xmath34 in figure  [ fig : camd ] as the bhm ",
    "vitense gap in the main sequence of the hyades .",
    "observational evidence for a bhm  vitense gap in the main sequence is sparse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and its reality has been disputed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous claims for its existence were based on the presence of gaps in either color - color diagrams or in the cumulative distribution of cluster members in some photometric index ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , instead of on the presence of ` gaps ' or ` turn - offs ' in color - absolute magnitude diagrams . the high - accuracy color - absolute magnitude diagram presented in figure  [ fig : camd ]",
    "provides the first direct evidence for the existence of the bhm ",
    "vitense turn - off and gap .",
    "the presence of a gap near @xmath35  mag ( @xmath36  k ) in the main sequence of the hyades was already noted by @xcite , who attributed it to ` _ a sudden increase in convection zone depths _ ' .",
    "figure  [ fig : camd ] reveals the associated turn - off .",
    "the position of this second bhm  vitense gap coincides with both the so - called lithium gap , which is generally thought to be related to the rapid growth of the depth of the surface convection zone with effective temperature decreasing from @xmath07000  k to @xmath06400  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with the onset of dynamo - induced magnetic chromospheric activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "narrow main sequences in color - magnitude diagrams are readily observable for distant clusters , but the absolute calibration of the hertzsprung  russell diagram of such groups is often uncertain due to their poorly determined distances and the effects of interstellar reddening and extinction .",
    "the latter problems are alleviated significantly for nearby clusters , but at the price of introducing a considerable spread in the location of individual members in the hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram as a result of their resolved intrinsic depths , and relatively poorly determined individual distances .",
    "we have shown here that the hyades are unique in that the secular parallaxes derived from the hipparcos astrometry for the members are sufficiently accurate to calibrate the main sequence of this nearest open cluster in absolute terms .",
    "the color - absolute magnitude diagram for the hyades shown in figure  [ fig : camd ] reveals two turn - offs and associated gaps in the main sequence .",
    "we identify these with the so - called bhm ",
    "vitense gaps , which are most likely related to sudden changes in the properties of surface convection zones in the atmospheres of stars with @xmath37 and @xmath00.45  mag , which significantly affect the emergent uv and blue - optical fluxes , and thus the @xmath1 color .",
    "we show in bhz that this substructure in the @xmath38 diagram provides a strong constraint on stellar models , requiring an improvement in the available transformations from colors and absolute magnitudes to effective temperatures and luminosities .",
    "the future astrometric satellites fame and gaia will improve the accuracy of stellar astrometry into the micro - arcsecond regime .",
    "they will make it possible to provide accurate membership and high - precision absolutely - calibrated main sequences for all star clusters and associations to distances of at least 2 kpc .",
    "this will provide the ability to test stellar models over a range of metallicities and ages , and may well reveal further substructure .      aizenman m.l .",
