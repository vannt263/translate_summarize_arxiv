    "the attractive hubbard model is very challenging for theorists since its physics is bearing quite some resemblance to the underdoped regime in high temperature superconductors @xcite , @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we treat analytically the intermediate coupling regime of this model .",
    "there are two characteristic temperatures in this regime .",
    "the first one is a crossover temperature @xmath2 , where the density of electrons in bound pairs @xmath3 is equal to the density of unpaired electrons @xmath4 .",
    "of course , the total density of charge carriers in the system satisfies the condition @xmath5 .",
    "the second temperature @xmath6 is a kosterlitz - thouless critical temperature @xcite of a superfluid transition in 2d .",
    "we consider the low - temperature normal regime of the model @xmath7 .",
    "we consider an attractive-@xmath0 hubbard model @xcite ( @xmath8 ) in the intermediate coupling regime @xmath9 .",
    "we restrict our calculations to low density limit in this limit the crossover temperature @xmath2 is given by @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the binding energy of a local pair on the empty lattice @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature reads @xcite , @xcite : @xmath12 low density means that @xmath13 , or , in another words : @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "we first calculate the two - particle @xmath1-matrix for small @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this yields : @xmath18 it is important to note that the pole - structure of the @xmath1-matrix reflects the creation of a bound pair with a mass @xmath19 and a bosonic chemical potential @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the one - particle chemical potential . as a result , we obtain the following expression for the one - particle spectral function : @xmath22 \\delta ( \\omega - \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{q}}+\\mu ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{|e_{\\mathrm{b}}| wn}{(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{q}}-\\mu)^2 } \\delta ( \\omega + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{q}}-\\mu+\\mu_{\\mathrm{b}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression describes an assymmetric two - band structure , consisting of a fermionic band and a bosonic band separated by a correlation gap @xmath23 . for @xmath24 :",
    "@xmath25 , hence @xmath26 and we have a new type of metal : a normal bosonic metal .",
    "let us study the resistivity and specific heat of this metal .",
    "at very low densities , when not only the parameter @xmath27 , but also @xcite , @xcite @xmath28 , the kosterlitz - thouless critical temperature is smaller than the degeneracy temperature @xmath29@xmath30 of a 2d gas of bound pairs . in this case",
    "the bosonic chemical potential at temperatures @xmath31 becomes exponentially small and reads : @xmath32 . as a result ,",
    "the specific heat of the system becomes linear @xcite : @xmath33 for @xmath31 .",
    "note that since @xmath34 for @xmath35 there is no @xmath36-point in our system .",
    "finally , the resistivity changes its behavior @xcite from @xmath37 for @xmath35 on @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that already such a simple theory , as presented above , brings a lot of similarities with the recent results of beautiful tunneling experiments @xcite in underdoped regime of htsc - materials .",
    "these similarities include a large value of the ratio of @xmath40@xmath41 and a strong anisotropy of the density of states both in theory and in experiment .",
