    "the classical no hair conjecture , first proposed by ruffini and wheeler states that the only allowed characteristics of stationary black holes are those associated with the gauss law , such as mass , angular momentum and electromagnetic charge @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , it follows that black holes can not support external scalar fields , since there is no gauss law for scalars .",
    "this fact is verified in @xcite for a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and in @xcite for non - minimally coupled scalar field in asymptotic flat spacetimes .",
    "however , recently , it is shown that there exist scalar hairy black hole if one uses a scalar potential with regions violating the weak energy condition @xcite . in recent year , we are faced with new black hole solutions in special gauge theories that einstein s equation is coupled with some gauge fields , and therefore this conjecture needs more investigation .",
    "for example the einstein - yang - mills black hole possess a short ranged external non abelian gauge field and is not uniquely specified by their mass , angular momentum and electromagnetic charge @xcite .",
    "although this solution is unstable @xcite , it opened up new possibility that the black holes may have various matter hairs .",
    "the global monopole field is an example of stable hair for asymptotically flat black hole @xcite .",
    "also explicit calculations have been carried out which verify the existence of a long range nielson - olesen vortex solution as a stable hair for a static black hole solution of einstein s equation in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "for the extreme black hole of einstein - maxwell gravity , it has been shown that flux expulsion occurs for thick strings ( thick with respect to the radius of horizon ) , while flux penetration occurs for thin strings @xcite .",
    "of course one may note that these situations fall out side of the scope of the classical no hair theorem due to the non trivial topology of the string configuration .",
    "it has recently been shown that these ideas can be extended to the case of anti de sitter ( ads ) and de sitter ( ds ) spacetimes .",
    "for asymptotically ads spacetimes , it has been shown that conformally coupled scalar field can be painted as hair @xcite .",
    "another asymptotically ads hairy black hole solution has been investigated in ref . @xcite .",
    "also it was shown that there exist a solution to the @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills equations which describes a stable yang - mills hairy black hole , that is asymptotically ads @xcite .",
    "although the idea of nielson - olesen vortices has been first introduced in flat spacetimes @xcite , but recently it has been extended to ( a)ds spacetimes @xcite .",

    "the presence of a rotation parameter introduces significant additional difficulties for explicit calculations intended to investigate the existence of a long range nielson - olesen vortex solution as a hair for a stationary black hole solution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the abelian higgs hair in a four dimensional rotating charged black string that is a stationary model for einstein - maxwell equations in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "various features of this kind of solutions of einstein - maxwell equations have been considered @xcite . here , we want to investigate the influence of rotation on the vortex solution of einstein - maxwell - higgs equations . since an analytic solution to the abelian higgs field equations appears to be intractable ,",
    "we confirm by numerical calculations that the rotating charged black string can be dressed by abelian higgs field as hair .    in sec .",
    "[ vor ] , we consider the abelian higgs field equations in the background of a rotating charged black string . section [ num ] is devoted to the numerical solutions of the field equations for different value of the rotation parameter and winding number . in sec .",
    "[ self ] , by studying the behavior of the abelian higgs field energy - momentum tensor , we find the effect of the vortex self - gravity on the rotating charged black string background .",
    "we append some closing remarks in sec .",
    "the lagrangian of einstein gravity in the presence of electromagnetic and abelian higgs fields is @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the negative cosmological constant and @xmath3 is the field strength tensor associated with the electromagnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) are the einstein - maxwell volume terms with negative cosmological constant , and @xmath5 is the lagrangian for abelian higgs system minimally coupled to gravity given as @xmath6 the matter content of the abelian higgs system consists of the complex higgs field , @xmath7 , and a @xmath8 gauge field @xmath9 with strength @xmath10 .",
    "both the higgs scalar and the gauge field become massive in the broken symmetry phase .",
    "they are coupled through the gauge covariant derivatives @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spacetime covariant derivative .",
    "we use units in which @xmath13 .",
    "the fields in @xmath5 will be treated as `` test field '' , i.e. , their energy momentum tensor is supposed to yield a negligible contribution to the source of the gravitational field .",
    "notice that we have two different gauge fields , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and each is treated in a different manner .",
    "it is only @xmath15 that couples to the higgs scalar field and is therefore subject to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the other gauge field , @xmath14 , can be thought of as the free massless maxwell field which apart from modifying the background geometry , its dynamic will be of little concern to us here .",
    "it is conventional to express the field equations in terms of real fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 defined as @xmath19 ,   \\label{xpfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the scalar higgs field and massive vector boson , and @xmath22 is a gauge degree of freedom . in terms of these new variables ,",
    "the lagrangian , @xmath5 and the field equations can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the field strength of the corresponding gauge field @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the stress energy tensors of the electromagnetic and higgs fields given by @xmath28    note that the real field @xmath22 is not itself a physical quantity . superficially it appears not to contain any physical information .",
    "however , if @xmath22 is not single valued this is no longer the case , and the resultant solutions are referred to as vortex solutions @xcite . in the presence of vortex , the requirement that the @xmath7 field be single valued implies that the line integral of @xmath22 over any closed loop is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the winding number of the vortex . in this case the flux of the field @xmath15 passing through such a closed loop is quantized with quanta @xmath31 .    it must be noted that no exact solution are known for the coupled einstein - higgs equations ( [ fi1])-([fi3 ] ) even in situations having both no electromagnetic charge and no horizon .",
    "thus we should try to solve these coupled differential equations approximately . in the first order approximation",
    ", we solve eqs .",
    "( [ fi1 ] ) and ( [ fi2 ] ) in the background of charged rotating black string and then we will carry out numerical calculations to solve eq .",

    "the metric of the charged rotating black string can be written as @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the constant parameters of the metric which are related to the mass and charge per unit length of the black string by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the rotation parameter .",
    "it is remarkable to note that the metric ( [ met2 ] ) reduces to ads spacetime as @xmath39 goes to infinity in contrast to the kerr - ads metric , for which the surface at infinity is also rotating .",
    "the horizon of this black string has cylindrical symmetry that has two inner and outer horizon at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , provided that @xmath34 is greater than @xmath42 given by @xmath43 in the case that @xmath44 , we will have an extreme black string .",
    "we seek a cylindrically symmetric solution for the higgs field equations ( [ fi1 ] ) and ( [ fi2 ] ) in the background of a charged rotating black string .",
    "thus , we assume that the fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of @xmath45 .",
    "for the case of vanishing rotation parameter , one can choose the gauge field as @xmath46 .",
    "the field equations ( [ fi1 ] ) and ( [ fi2 ] ) reduce in that case to two equations for the two unknown functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the present case the field equations ( [ fi1 ] ) and ( [ fi2 ] ) reduce to three equations and",

    "it is worthwhile to mention that even in the pure flat or ( anti ) de sitter spacetimes no exact analytic solutions are known for equations ( [ fi1 ] ) and ( [ fi2 ] ) . for asymptotically ads",
    "spacetimes , one of us have showed that the abelian higgs equations of motion in the background of charged black string spacetime have vortex solution @xcite . here",
    "we want to investigate the influence of rotation parameter on the vortex solutions .",
    "the main difference between this rotating black string and the non rotating case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is the following . in the static case we had only two unknown functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , but here we encounter with three unknown functions @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath53 . the latter function @xmath54 which is the time component of @xmath9 creates a radial electric - type field , @xmath55 that goes to zero as the rotation parameter goes to zero . it should be noted that even in the case of @xmath56 , no exact analytic solutions are known for eqs .",

    "so , here we seek the existence of vortex solutions for these coupled differential equations numerically .",
    "first , we must take appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "since at a large distance from the horizon the metric ( [ met2 ] ) reduces to ads spacetime , we demand that our solutions go to the solutions of the vortex equations in ads spacetime given in @xcite .",
    "this requires that we demand ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) as @xmath52 goes to infinity and ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) on the horizon . for consistency with the non - rotating case @xcite ,",
    "we take @xmath61 on the horizon .",
    "also one may note that the electric field , @xmath62 which is proportional to @xmath63 should be zero as @xmath52 goes to infinity .",
    "we employ a grid of points @xmath64 , where @xmath64 goes from @xmath65 to some large value of @xmath52 ( @xmath66 ) which is much greater than @xmath65 .",
    "we rewrite eqs .",

    "first , we investigate the influence of rotation parameter on the solutions of field equations ( [ eqm1])-([eqm3 ] ) .",
    "we carry out all the calculation for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for which the radius of horizon is @xmath71 .",
    "figures [ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] show the behavior of the electric , @xmath72 , and the magnetic , @xmath73 , fields associated with the field @xmath21 respectively for different values of the rotation parameters .",
    "we use the subscript `` higgs '' for these electromagnetic field to emphasis that they are coupled with the higgs scalar field @xmath7 . as one",

    "[ figure2 ] for different values of angular momentum .",
    "this figure shows that the variation of @xmath76 with respect to the rotation parameter is very slow .",
    "overall , these figures show that the vortex thickness decreases as the rotation parameter increases .",
    "as we mentioned , in the case of non vanishing rotation parameter we encounter with the electric field @xmath74 .",
    "one may compute the source of this electric field through the use of gauss law numerically .",
    "it is notable that the computation of this electric type charge for @xmath74 shows that it increases as @xmath38 becomes larger .",
    "this is analogous to the rotating solutions of einstein - maxwell equation discussed in the context of cosmic string theory for which the electric charge of the string is proportional to the rotation parameter of the string @xcite .",
    "next we investigate the influence of the winding number @xmath30 on the solutions of field equations ( [ eqm1])-([eqm3 ] ) for the case of rotating charged black string .",
    "the results for @xmath77 are shown in figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] , [ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] for different values of @xmath30 . as in the case of",
    "asymptotically flat , ds , and ads spacetimes considered in refs . @xcite and @xcite , increasing the winding number yields a greater vortex thickness .",
    "the effects of charge or mass parameters on the solutions of field equations ( [ eqm1])-([eqm3 ] ) for the case of rotating charged black string are the same as the nonrotating case , which is considered in @xcite .",
    "the extreme black string needs more investigation .",
    "bonjour et.al .",
    "@xcite have shown that vortices of size smaller than a certain fraction of the radius of the reissner - nordstrm black hole will definitely pierce the horizon , whereas vortices thicker than a certain lower bound will instead wrap the black hole .",
    "we will consider the extreme case in future .",
    "in previous section we found the solutions of higgs field equation in the background of charged rotating black string . here",
    "we want to solve the coupled einstein - maxwell - higgs differential equation ( [ fi1])-([fi3 ] ) .",
    "this is a formidable problem even for flat or ads spacetimes , and no exact solutions have been found for these spacetimes yet . indeed , besides the electromagnetic stress energy tensor , the energy - momentum tensor of the higgs field is also a source for einstein equation ( [ fi3 ] ) .",
    "however , some physical results can be obtained by making some approximations .",
    "first , we assume that the thickness of the skin covering the black string is much smaller than all the other relevant length scales .",
    "second , we assume that the gravitational effects of the higgs field are weak enough so that the linearized einstein - abelian higgs differential equations are applicable .",
    "we choose @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the rotating charged black string metric in the absence of the higgs field and @xmath80 is the first order correction to the metric . employing the two assumptions concerning the thickness of the vortex and its weak gravitational field , the first order approximation to einstein equation ( [ fi3 ] )",
    "can be written as : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the first order correction to the einstein tensor due to @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the energy - momentum tensor of the higgs field in the rotating charged black string background metric with components : @xmath85 where @xmath20 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are the solutions of the abelian higgs system . as we mentioned in the last section , the vortex thickness decreases as the rotation parameter increases .",
    "this fact is more clear in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] which shows @xmath88 for various values of @xmath38 .    for convenience , we use the following form , which has cylindrical symmetry , of the metric @xmath89    in order to solve numerically eq .",

    "here we want to obtain the behavior of these functions for large values of the coordinate @xmath52 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , the components of the energy - momentum tensor rapidly go to zero outside the skin , so the situation is the same as what happened in the static black string spacetime considered in @xcite .",

    "the results which are displayed in fig .",

    "we considered the abelian higgs field in the background of a stationary rotating charged black string .",
    "we obtained the numerical solutions for various values of rotation parameter and found that for a fixed horizon radius , by increasing the rotation parameter the vortex thickness decrease very slowly . also the numerical solutions for various values of winding number",
    "were obtained .",
    "these solutions shows that the vortex thickness increases as winding number increases .",
    "these situations hold also in the case of the extremal black string .",

    "this electric field increases as the rotation parameter becomes larger .",
