    "it is worth to mention that , due to environmental perturbations , these systems lose coherence .",
    "for example , confined electrons interact with spin nuclei through the hyperfine interaction leading , inevitably , to decoherence @xcite .",
    "even , having just one charged impurity could induce qubit decoherence if this impurity is dynamic and has a fluctuation time scale comparable to gate operation time scales @xcite .",

    "the entanglement , which is one of the most curious phenomena in quantum mechanics , is being considered in recent years as a physical resource that can be used for quantum information processes as teleportation of quantum states @xcite .",

    "zunger and he @xcite studied the effect of interdot distance and asymmetry on the spatial entanglement of two - electron coupled quantum dots .",

    "one of the main goals of this paper is the calculation of the spatial entanglement @xcite of the two electrons in a double qd molecule in presence of charged impurities .",
    "experimentally , results very difficult to measure the amount of entanglement of two electron in a coupled qd directly .",
    "there exist several techniques that allows one to measure the possibility of double occupation @xcite and the optical properties such as the dipole transition , the oscillator strength and the photoionization cross section @xcite of these systems .",
    "if we know the relationship between these quantities and the degree of entanglement , we can have information about the amount of entanglement of our system .",
    "the possibility of using this information in order to design nanodevices according to the level of entanglement desired results quite difficult because the positions and the strength of the impurities are unknown . despite this , there are some recent experiments which show the mechanism of dopant incorporation and how the incorporation of impurity defects can be controlled @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a detailed analysis of the electronic and optical properties of a two - dimensional two - electron coupled quantum dot and the effect of impurities . in particular we show that the entanglement of the electrons is strongly modulated by the position and charge of the impurity .",

    "section iv , contains calculations of the oscillator strength , for a range of parameters of the system , that show the modifications of the optical properties in the presence of a charged impurity , with the aim of allowing to correlate optical measurements with the degree of entanglement of the system . finally , in section v we summarize the conclusions with a discussion of the most relevant points of our analysis .",
    "we consider two laterally coupled two - dimensional quantum dots whose centers are separated a distance @xmath0 from each other , and containing two electrons . in quantum dots",
    "electrostatically produced , both their size and separation can be controlled by variable gate voltages through metallic electrodes deposited on the heterostructure interface .",
    "the eventual existence of doping hydrogenic impurities , probably arising from si dopant atoms in the gaas quantum well , have been experimentally studied @xcite .",
    "these impurities have been theoretically analyzed with a superimposed attractive @xmath1-type potential @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some avoided crossing and lifted degeneracies in the spectra of single - electron transport experiments have been attributed to negatively charged coulomb impurities located near to the qd @xcite . from fitting the experimental transport spectra to a single - electron model of softened parabolic confinement with a coulomb charge @xmath2 , a set of parameters",
    "are obtained ; among them , a radius of confinement of @xmath3 nm , a confinement frequency @xmath4 mev and an impurity charge of approximately 1 or 2 electron charges .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty in the parameters and the suppositions introduced in the model does not allow one to precisely ensure the impurity charge , with the screening probably reducing its effective value to less than an electron charge .",
    "therefore , we consider the charge of the doping atom @xmath5 as a parameter varying in the range @xmath6 , in order to explore its effect on the properties of the system .    in this work we model the hamiltonian of the two - dimensional two - electron coupled quantum dot in presence of charged impurities within the single conduction - band effective - mass approximation @xcite , namely ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the single - electron hamiltonian that includes the kinetic energy of the electrons , in terms of their effective mass @xmath12 , and the confining potential for the left and right quantum dots @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the interaction of the electrons with the charged impurities , @xmath15 .",

    "the exponents @xmath43 were optimized for a single gaussian well and a single atom separately , and supplemented with extra functions when used together . for our calculations a basis set of @xmath44 functions for the dots , and @xmath45 for the atom was found to achieve converged results for the energy spectrum .",
    "the numerical results presented in this work refers to those corresponding to the parameters of gaas : effective mass @xmath46 , effective dielectric constant @xmath47 , bohr radius @xmath48 nm and effective atomic unit of energy 1 hartree@xmath49 mev @xcite .",
    "the depth of the gaussian potentials modelling the dots are taken as @xmath50 hartree@xmath51 mev , and its typical range @xmath52 nm .",
    "the proposed applications of qds for quantum computing require a large exchange coupling between electrons along separated regions of space .",
    "to some extent , both requirements compete with each other . in a simple picture",
    ", one could have a large exchange coupling for electrons doubly occupying the same dot or atom .",
    "in such a case , the singlet state has the form of a product wave function @xmath53 with the corresponding singlet spin function ; the lowest triplet state , however , has the form of the antisymmetrized product of two single - electron functions , @xmath54 , of different single - particle energies @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the triplet state will have a quite higher energy than the singlet state , thus giving a large exchange coupling .",
    "nevertheless , such a large coupling is not favourable for quantum computing tasks because the states are localized in space . using electron states as qubits requires , for instance",
    ", the feasibility to detect the single or double occupancy of two quantum dots , separated a measurable distance , while keeping both electrons correlated .",
    "as the interdot separation increases , the electron - electron interaction diminishes and its relative importance with respect to the confining potential tends to vanish . in the limit of large interdot separations ,",
    "the coulomb repulsion is minimized by singly occupying each quantum dots with an electron .",
    "in such a limit , the energies of both the singlet @xmath57 and triplet @xmath58 states , @xmath59 approach the sum of singly occupied dots and their difference @xmath60 tends to zero . in other words ,",
    "the best conditions for applications to quantum information processing arises from a compromise between a high spatial correlation of pairs of electrons at the longest possible lengths where the exchange coupling @xmath60 is still sizable .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , assuming a positively charged impurity of one electron charge ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "fig [ f1 ] shows the singlet and triplet ground - state energies for the double qd , separated a distance @xmath62 nm , as a function of impurity position @xmath63 .",
    "the inset shows the behaviour of the singlet - triplet exchange coupling as a function of the impurity position .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with those of ref .",
    "the singlet - triplet exchange coupling is strongly affected for the presence of the charged impurity , it has the maximum value when the impurity is centered in between the two dots , and it has a minimum close to zero when the impurity is located at @xmath64 .",
    "expectedly , the splitting goes asymptotically to the impurity - free double qd case when the impurity atom is located far away from the double qd system",
    ". we shall show below that the impurity positions that give high energy splitting , i.e. , those near to the middle of the interdot distance , correspond to a two - electron ground state whose spatial wave function is highly localized at the impurity atom , thus having a small spatial entanglement .    in what follows",

    "the inset shows the singlet - triplet exchange coupling @xmath60 as a function of impurity position.,width=226 ]    we shall study now how the degree of spatial quantum correlation of two electrons in the coupled qd is modified by the position and charge of a screened atomic impurity .",
    "as mentioned above , the eigenstate wave functions can be factorized in its orbital and spin part . for the ground state ,",
    "the spin part is a singlet wave function , which is maximally entangled and constant .",
    "therefore , throughout this work , we will only consider the spatial entanglement @xcite .",
    "the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix quantifies the entanglement for a bipartite pure state and can be calculated using @xcite    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the reduced density operator , @xmath69 is the two - electron wave function and the trace is taken over one electron .",

    "it is observed that , for small interdot separations , the entropy is small , smoothly increasing with the interdot separation .",
    "the increase of the spatial entanglement is due to a gradual delocalization of the ground state wave function . for interdot distances",
    "between 20 and 40 nm , there is a large increase of the entanglement entropy , signalling a qualitative change of the ground state wave function from a atomic doubly occupied state to a state with both dots singly occupied , reached at large interdot separations ( @xmath75 nm ) , where the entropy saturates to its maximum @xmath29 .",
    "the variation of @xmath76 is similar for all the cases , although the presence of the impurity decreases the entanglement for every interdot separation , due to the fact that the atomic potential contributes to localize the electronic density at the center of the system .",

    "this modulation of the entanglement by the impurity position reflects the existence of two regimes : one of low entanglement for impurities at ( or near to ) the center of the interdot distance , and another of higher ( but not maximum ) entanglement for atomic positions external to the interdot segment . in fig .",
    "[ svx2z ] , this two regions are the ones to the left and the right of the bell - shaped peak of @xmath76 , respectively .",

    ", however , the peak of @xmath76 occurs at @xmath83 nm .",
    "the rationale for it is that , for low charged impurities , the atomic potential is a weak perturbation to the qds potential wells .",
    "therefore , the entropy varies in a small range ( @xmath84 ) around the impurity - free case @xmath79 . for large impurity charges , nevertheless , the atomic potential is strong and the position of its center greatly determines the spatial wave function .",
    "the range of atomic positions ( @xmath85 nm ) along which @xmath76 remains low , can be understood as due to the localization of the electrons close to the atom .",
    "when the atom is inside one of the dots ( qd@xmath86 ) , the atomic potential reinforces that of the dot well and the electron density localization , thus giving a low degree of entanglement .",

    "the centers of the dots @xmath157 nm are held symmetrical with respect to the origin of coordinates . the atom is successively placed at @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 nm . ]     ( color online ) same as fig .",
    "[ 2-particle s1 ] for the first excited two - electron singlet wave function @xmath166 . ]    for a single - electron symmetric double dot system without impurity , the ground and first excited states are the bonding and antibonding states formed from the linear combination of orbitals centered at each dot .",
    "for the two - electron symmetric double dot system , figs .",
    "[ 2-particle s1 ] and [ 2-particle s2 ] show that when the atom is at the center of the line joining both dots ( @xmath167 ) , the two - particle wave function of the ground state ( excited state ) roughly corresponds to one electron in the atom and the other in the bond ( antibond ) of the double dot system , eq . ( [ eq bond ] ) .",
    "therefore , the matrix element @xmath168 roughly correspond to the sum of those for the atom and the double dot separately .    at @xmath169 nm ,",
    "the atom is at the center of the dot to the right , the system becomes very asymmetric , with the potential of dot to the right deeper than the one to the left due to the contribution of the attractive impurity .",
    "the bond becomes a doubly occupied state localized close to the center of the combined potential ( qd@xmath86 and impurity ) , while the antibond becomes more localized around to qd@xmath170 , due the orthogonality condition , what lowers @xmath107 .",
    "the behavior in the range @xmath123 nm reflects this gradual change .    from 15 to 30 nm , the effect of the impurity turns weaker as the atom moves away , and",
    "the two dots becomes more symmetric again ; this redistribute the charge towards qd@xmath170 , recovering some bonding and antibonding character for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "such a configuration favours an increase of @xmath107 . furthermore ,",
    "as one electron remains in the atom , which is farther from the origin , the matrix element of @xmath65 becomes larger than the one corresponding to the atom at the origin .",
    "the oscillator strength has a peak at 33 nm roughly increasing quadratically with the position of the atom as a consequence of the stretching of the charge .",
    "after 33 nm , the electron in the atom can not be retained by the impurity potential , thus @xmath171 approaches to a configuration with one electron in each dot .",
    "nevertheless , the excited state @xmath172 still have a configuration where the atom is occupied , what lowers @xmath173 .    for atom positions further than 40 nm",
    ", the excited state also releases its electron and the double quantum dot becomes even more symmetric , approaching its behavior in the absence of impurity , thus approaching its value @xmath174 .",
    "the limit of isolated dots is clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ 2-particle s1 ] and [ 2-particle s2 ] , where for @xmath175 nm , the ground and first excited states are , approximately , @xmath176/ \\sqrt{2}$ ] and @xmath177/\\sqrt{2}$ ] .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ os vs x ] , the oscillator strength for impurity charges smaller than @xmath61 , has simpler features .",
    "basically , they start from a value @xmath107 slightly less than 2 , decreases until a minimum as the atom approaches one dot , say qd@xmath86 , and increases again smoothly until reaching the asymptotic impurity - free value of 2 .    the oscillator strength is a highly sensitive property to the presence of the impurity .",
    "a value of @xmath107 close to 2 , occurs either when the impurity is weak wherever it is located , or when a highly charged impurity atom is far away from the double qd .",
    "both cases are situations where the impurity is a perturbation for the coupled qds and , therefore amenable of use in quantum computing . on the contrary ,",
    "deviations of the oscillator strength from a value of 2 , provides an indication of a breakdown of the possibility to consider the system as a double qd .",
    "in this work , we have studied the influence of a coulomb atomic impurity on the entanglement entropy of two - dimensional two - electron double quantum dots .",
    "the electronic structure was calculated by using a configuration interaction method with a gaussian basis set expansion .",
    "the degree of entanglement becomes highly modulated by both the location and charge screening of the impurity atom .",
    "two regimes are clearly identified : one of low entanglement and other of high entanglement , with both of them mainly determined by the magnitude of the charge .",
    "the exchange coupling between the electrons , being proportional to singlet - triplet exchange coupling , has an opposite behaviour with respect to the one of the entropy .",
    "the efficient use of double qds with impurities , in specific quantum information processing tasks could require the tuning of the interdot separation or the quantum well depths , for optimizing the harnessing of the entanglement , the exchange coupling or both .",
    "finally , the magnitude of the oscillator strength of the system could provide an indication of the presence and characteristics of impurities that could largely influence the degree of entanglement of the system .",
    "it is clear that experimentally obtained optical properties can help in the design of double qds with desirable properties in order to use them in quantum information tasks .",
    "the quantum control of these kind of systems can be implemented using pulses of external fields .",
    "this issue if of great importance in quantum computation and a work about the interaction of electromagnetic fields with the system presented here is in progress .",
    "of course the decoherence , not considered in these works , plays a very important role in the quantum dynamics of these kind of devices .",
    "studies in markovian scenarios suggested that the entanglement vanishes due to decoherence , while the decoherence process in non - markovian regimes sometimes gives rise to an interesting new effect : entanglement sudden revival @xcite .",
    "we think that can be very interesting and useful to study the non - markovian dynamics of these system in the low and high entanglement regions depicted in the present article .",
