    "the present work is part of a larger project to study the galactic plane ( isogal , omont & blommaert  @xcite ; prault et al .",
    "@xcite ) . during the iso mission ,",
    "the isogal consortium observed with isocam at 15 and 7 @xmath2 m selected parts of the galactic plane ( about 18 sq.deg .",
    "distributed along the inner galactic disk ) in order to study the stellar populations in the inner galaxy , with a sensitivity and resolution two orders of magnitude better than iras .",
    "the main scientific goal of the isogal project was the study of the distribution and properties of the agb stars .",
    "however , the survey is unbiased , with the only exception of excluding from the surveyed area strong iras sources ( with 12 @xmath2 m flux densities greater than 6 - 10 jy ) in order to avoid saturation effects .",
    "thus the survey data can be used to study any other type of mid - ir source present in the galactic plane , as for instance the less numerous hii regions associated to young massive stars .    for a proper identification of source types ,",
    "the isogal results need to be compared with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "in particular , for the study of agb stars comparisons with near ir observations , taken primarily with denis ( epchtein  @xcite ) , are useful . for the study of hii regions comparisons with radio continuum surveys",
    "are more appropriate .",
    "a large fraction of the northern sky galactic fields covered by isogal have already been observed at 6  cm ( 5  ghz ) with the vla ( see becker et al 1994 and references therein ) , and a comparison of the two surveys is underway .",
    "however , these radio observations terminate at @xmath3 and there were no high frequency ( e.g @xmath45  ghz ) radio continuum observations for the isogal field at @xmath1 .",
    "observations at lower frequencies , such as the 1.4 ghz northern vla sky survey ( nvss  condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) , are inadequate to detect the younger and more dense compact hii regions , which may be optically thick at 1.4 ghz .    given our interest , within the isogal team , to study the young massive stars , we decided to observe the @xmath1 field at high frequencies with the vla , to provide a data base comparable to that of becker et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in order to obtain radio spectral index information we covered at 6 and 3.6  cm an area slightly larger than the @xmath1 isogal field .",
    "the selection of the isogal galactic plane fields does not follow any _ ad hoc _ criterion , but is based on symmetrically spaced samples on both sides of the galactic center , with the spacing increasing with distance from the galactic center .",
    "the @xmath1 field happens to be located tangent to a spiral arm of our galaxy , the scutum arm ( see e.g. kurtz et al .",
    "inspection of the 4.875 ghz galactic plane survey of altenhoff et al .",
    "( @xcite ) shows that there is very weak diffuse galactic background emission in this direction .",
    "only 7 sources of the altenhoff et al .",
    "catalogue fall in our surveyed area or at its borders ( see table  [ talt ] ) .",
    "one of these ( 44.7860.490 ) is partly outside our surveyed area .",
    "most of these sources are associated with bright iras point sources and have not been covered by the isocam observations except for 45.2020.441 and 45.3410.370 .    in this work we present the radio observations and discuss the comparison with other radio surveys and with iras data .",
    "comparison with isogal data , as well as with dedicated j , h , k observations of the same field taken with tirgo will be the subject of following works .",
    "the isogal field centered at @xmath5 , @xmath6 was observed at 6 ( 4.9  ghz ) and 3.6  cm ( 8.5  ghz ) using the nrao very large array ( vla ) in the c configuration on 1997 august 5 ( 8  hours ) . at",
    "6  cm the observational setup was similar to that used by becker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the only differences being that our pointing centers are more closely packed and , due to the peculiar geometry of the sub - fields observed with iso , we covered the field by scanning strips at constant galactic longitude , which required a total of 31 pointings ; our integration time per position was 300  s. at 3.6  cm we used a similar pointing scheme but scaled due to the smaller primary beam .",
    "the observing time per position was reduced to 210  s , and the entire field was mapped with 74 pointings .",
    "8 pointings were observed at 3.6  cm during a 1  hour test run on 1997 july  4 , however , due to a bug in the schedule , only some of the pointings fell in our survey region . for the sake of completeness",
    "we will also report the results for the 3 pointings outside our formal survey region that form a spur in position angle 30 degrees .",
    "due to the ill - determined primary beam correction and the rapid loss of sensitivity far from the pointing center , we searched for sources only the area where the primary beam attenuation is less than a factor of 3 . with this constraint",
    ", we covered an area of @xmath00.620  sq .  deg . at 6  cm , and @xmath00.525  sq .",

    "the calibration is expected to be accurate within 10% .",
    "we imaged all the fields using the aips imagr task with natural weighting , the resulting synthesized beam varied somewhat from field to field depending on the hour angle at which each field was observed , typical fwhm values are @xmath9 at 6  cm and @xmath10 at 3.6  cm .",
    "due to the vla primary beam attenuation and the different noise values in the various fields , the sensitivity of our observations is not expected to be uniform accross the observed region . using our knowledge of the vla primary beam attenuation pattern and the measured on - axis rms level in each of the observed fields , we computed the sensitivity maps for our survey at 3.6 and 6  cm ( see also zoonematkermani et al .",
    "@xcite and becker et al .",

    "the images were then corrected for primary beam attenuation using the aips task pbcor before source extraction .",
    "the j2000.0 positions , peak and integrated flux densities and the sizes of the detected sources at both frequencies are listed in table  [ tsrc ] . in general , all the reported detections have a signal - to - noise ratio greater than five in at least one of the two bands .",
    "the names assigned to the sources have been derived from their galactic coordinates , as in becker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we arbitrarily divided the sources into two categories : 1 ) compact sources and 2 ) extended sources . in the first group are all the unresolved sources or the sources with deconvolved sizes of the same order or smaller than the synthesized beam fwhm .",
    "all the extended sources have sizes much greater than the synthesized fwhm , and thus they may be partially resolved out by the interferometer . the flux densities ( and sizes )",
    "reported in table  [ tsrc ] for these sources should be considered as lower limits .",
    "we shall see in the following that this arbitrary distinction based on observational considerations reflects also some intrinsic physical difference between the two groups .    at large distances from the pointing center ,",

    "in all five cases , the iras error ellipse contains the radio continuum source or overlaps with the boundaries of the extended radio sources .",
    "in fact , in all five cases the distance from the peak of the radio continuum source and the nominal iras position is less than 30@xmath41 .",
    "the fir fluxes of these five sources are reported in table  [ tspecind ] , columns  7 to 10 .",
    "the study of the iras color - color diagram is a powerful tool to investigate the nature of the fir sources .",
    "different types of objects tend to populate different parts of the color - color planes . in fig .",
    "[ firascc ] we show three of the color - color diagrams that can be constructed using the four iras fluxes , and that have been shown to be able to separate different types of galactic sources ( e.g. eder , lewis & terzian  @xcite ; pottasch et al .",

    "it is remarkable , however , that all , and only , the iras sources detected in radio continuum ( marked with plus symbols in the figure ) lie in well - defined , low - density parts of the planes .",
    "this is the part of the color - color planes where ultra compact hii ( uchii ) regions are expected to be found ( wc89 ; wood & churchwell  @xcite ; kurtz , churchwell & wood  @xcite ; white et al .",
    "@xcite ; becker et al .",
    "we shall now classify the sources detected in our survey and reported in table 1 according to morphology , spectral index and coincidence with iras sources .",
    "five complexes of sources have all the specifications for being classified as thermal galactic hii regions .",
    "they include all the extended sources plus some additional small diameter source in the same area , more precisely [ 11 + 12 + 30 ] , [ 13 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 31 ] ,  [ 34 ] ,  [ 18 + 33 ] and [ 32 ] ( numbers are from table  [ tsrc ] ) .",
    "all these complexes coincide with corresponding sources in the altenhoff et al .",
    "@xcite survey ( see sect .  [ salt ] ) and are now resolved in much more detail .",
    "morphologically they show the classical aspect of a cluster of hii regions , of which g9.62 + 0.19 is a typical example ( testi et al .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , i.e. several sources of different angular sizes ( from unresolved to several tens of arcsec ) are clustered in the same area .",
    "the continuum sources may represent independent uchii regions born in the same star forming complex but presently observed in different evolutionary phases with the unresolved sources being the youngest and the more extended sources more evolved .",
    "six of the small diameter sources ( 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 19 , 22 ) can be classified as `` candidate hii region '' according to their spectral index .",
    "no iras source is associated with them , but their radio flux is rather low",
    ". non detection at far infrared wavelengths could be either due to the intrinsic weakness of some of these sources or , most probably , due to the incompleteness of the iras - psc in the galactic plane ( see also becker et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the remaining 15 sources ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 20 , 21 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 and 29 ) can be classified from the spectral index as non thermal ( probably extragalactic ) sources .",
    "only five of these have been detected at 20 cm .",
    "these have in general greater integrated flux densities at 6 cm than those not detected at 20 cm ( the mean 6  cm flux densities of the two groups are 10 and 2 mjy , respectively ) , so that the effect can be simply explained as due to our higher sensitivity at 6 cm .",
    "all 15 sources have been detected at 6  cm and 4 of them at 3.6  cm as well .",
    "given the area observed at 6  cm ( 0.620  sq .",
    "deg . ) and that observed at 3.6  cm ( 0.525  sq.deg . ) , the number of extragalactic sources above the 1  mjy threshold , which we can assume as a mean detection limit for our survey , can be estimated from deep vla surveys .",
    "following fomalont et al .",
    "( @xcite ) at 6  cm we expect 15 extragalactic sources above our 1  mjy threshold , while at 3.6  cm the number is reduced to 9 sources for the same threshold ( windhorst et al .",
    "@xcite ) . given the small number statistics , these numbers are in relatively good agreement with the source counts in our surveyed area .",
    "becker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimated a total of @xmath50 planetary nebulae ( pns ) down to a flux limit of @xmath37  mjy in their 6  cm survey of 50  sq.deg .",
    "of the inner galactic plane .",
    "this number correspond to less than 2 pns expected down to the same flux level in our 6  cm survey region .",
    "thus the contamination from pns in our source lists should be very small .      in sect .",
    "3.4 it was pointed out that all the iras sources with a corresponding radio counterpart in our survey ( 5 out of 43 ) satisfy the color - color criteria to be classified as uchii regions ( wc89 ) .",
    "however , with the possible exception of the double source g045.070@xmath80.132 and g045.072@xmath80.132 ( 11 and 12 ) , none of the radio sources within 100@xmath41 from the iras - psc position can be classified as _ bona fide _ uchii region using the usual definition ( wood & churchwell  @xcite ; kurtz et al .",
    "the radio continuum sources are extended ( non homogeneous ) hii regions , with emission peaks inside them that may appear as uchii regions when observerved with an extended vla configuration",
    ". a tipical example could be g045.455@xmath80.060 which appears as a compact source inside the extended hii region g045.455@xmath80.059 ( see figure  [ exfig3 ] ) , this source has the appearence of an uchii region in the wood & churchwell  ( @xcite ) survey ( their source g45.45@xmath80.06 ) .",
    "the vla high frequency and high resolution surveys of iras selected uchii candidates are all biased to the detection of only the most compact and dense ionized gas , due to the spatial filtering of the interferometer , and are unable to detect the extended components .",
    "our results agree with those of kurtz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and show that , when observed with sufficient sensitivity to extended structures , most , if not all , the iras selected uchii candidates do have extended radio components .",
    "this implies that samples of iras - psc sources selected with the wc89 criteria are contaminated by a _",
    "substantial _ number of _ older _ more extended hii regions ( see also codella , felli & natale  @xcite ; ramesh & sridharan  @xcite ; kurtz et al .",
    "the number of uchii regions estimated from the color selected iras - psc counts may be , consequently , overestimated by a large factor .",
    "if most iras - wc89 sources are indeed associated with extended hii rather than uchii regions , the lifetime of the iras - wc89 color phase of uchii / hii regions may be much longer than estimated from the early high resolution radio surveys .",
    "consequently , the estimated lifetime of the uchii phase for o - type young stars is probably much shorter that previously thought ( see also ramesh & sridharan  @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , we find 6 uchii candidates in our radio continuum survey without an associated iras source .",
    "as discussed by becker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , this is probably due to the confusion limit of the psc on the galactic plane , and the generally lower radio luminosity of these sources .",
    "however , we note that in our field _ only _ unresolved thermal radio sources are not present in the iras - psc , while _ all _ resolved hii regions are detected in the far - infrared",
    ". incidentally , we note that all the compact thermal radio sources in our survey not associated with iras psc sources are fainter at centimeter wavelengths than those detected in the far infrared , and thus they may be associated with stars of type later than o. however , without knowing the distances it is impossible to draw a final conclusion .    in our surveyed region ,",
    "the percentage of iras sources satisfying wc89 color criteria is ( 5@xmath5143@xmath012% ) .",
    "this is consistent with the percentage found accross the entire inner galactic plane ( @xmath48 , @xmath52 , @xmath53% ) .",
    "the fraction of wc89 sources in the iras - psc database drops to much lower values outside the inner galactic plane ( wc89 ) .      during an incomplete low spatial resolution ( 2@xmath7 )",
    "single dish survey of the @xmath1 field in the h@xmath54o 22  ghz maser line , a new maser was detected .",
    "the masing gas is probably coincident with a 15 @xmath2 m source ( f@xmath55 = 370 mjy ) located at @xmath56 @xmath57 , and was interpreted as a candidate young stellar object ( testi et al .",
    "therefore , it was interesting to see if any radio continuum emission from an associated uc hii region could be detected .    from a careful inspection of the area around the maser ,",
    "no radio continuum emission was seen above the ( local ) 3@xmath58 level ( 0.6  mjy / beam at 3.6  cm and 1.2  mjy / beam at 6  cm ) . with the young stellar object hypothesis in mind , there are two possible explanations : 1 ) the putative uchii region is intrinsically too weak to be detected or absent because the eventual exciting star is of late spectral type ; or 2 ) there is an uchii region , but it is in such an early evolutionary phase that it is optically thick even at 3.6 cm . the lack of radio continuum emission close to h@xmath54o masers in high luminosity star forming regions has been amply demonstrated by a survey of a large number of maser in the radio continuum , which showed that many maser associated with high luminosity sources do not have any close - by radio continuum source ( tofani et al .",
    "subsequent molecular observations of the masers without continuum emission has indeed confirmed that these are associated with very young star forming regions since in all cases a hot molecular core was found at the same position ( cesaroni et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    to settle the nature of the new maser - 15@xmath2 m source ,",
    "molecular observations in high density tracers are needed , as well as an estimate of its luminosity .",
    "the unbiased radio continuum survey of the isogal field at @xmath1 has resolved the structure of five thermal extended complexes and discovered 21 additional small diameter sources , six of which are candidate hii regions .",
    "comparison with the iras psc shows that all 5 of the extended thermal sources have corresponding fir emission and that the colors of these sources satisfy the wc89 color criteria for uchii .",
    "our sources , however , are _ not _ uchii regions , but are more evolved extended hii regions .",
    "this result is consistent with the results of earlier single dish surveys ( codella et al .",
    "@xcite ) and of a recent survey for extended emission around iras - selected uchii regions(kurtz et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that uchii counts based on iras selected samples are overestimated by a large factor , consequently the estimated lifetime of the uchii phase may be substantially reduced , removing the so - called lifetime problem for uchii regions .",
    "the percentage of iras sources associated with hii regions is @xmath010% in our field , which seems to be a general property of iras sources in the galactic plane .",
    "support from cnr - nato advanced fellowship program and from nasa s _ origins of solar systems _ program ( through grant nagw4030 ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in this appendix we present the contour plots of all the sources detected in our survey .",
