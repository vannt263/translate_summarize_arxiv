    "in this section we develop some basic ideas of time - frequency analysis and lead up to the main results to be discussed in this paper . for a more comprehensive account of this subject",
    "we recommend the book of grchenig @xcite ; see also daubechies @xcite .    for",
    "an @xmath0 function @xmath1 on @xmath2 , the fourier transform and its inversion formula @xmath3 provide the expansion of @xmath1 in terms of the pure ` sine waves ' @xmath4 .",
    "( when it is often appropriate to refer to @xmath5 as ` time ' and @xmath6 as ` frequency . '",
    "we shall sometimes use these terms even when dealing with general @xmath7 , for which the basic mathematical structure is exactly the same . )",
    "the fourier transform is a marvelous tool , but since it involves the  whole function @xmath1 at once , it is not an efficient way to analyze the ways in which different frequencies enter into @xmath1 at different times ( as is of paramount importance , for example , in music ) .    one way to produce a ` local ' fourier analysis of a function @xmath1 is to use the _ windowed fourier transform _ , which is also known as the _ short - time fourier transform _ and is closely related to the _ cross - ambiguity function _ of radar theory and the _ fourier  wigner transform _ in @xcite .",
    "the idea is simple : one fixes an @xmath0 function @xmath8 on @xmath2 such that @xmath9 and considers the fourier transform not of @xmath1 but of @xmath1 multiplied by translates of @xmath8 , obtaining a function @xmath10 on @xmath11 : @xmath12 @xmath10 is called the _ windowed fourier transform of @xmath1 with window @xmath8_. ( the reasons for the complex conjugation on @xmath8 and the normalization @xmath9 will become apparent shortly . ) if one takes @xmath8 to be a nonnegative function supported on an interval @xmath13 centered at the origin ( or at least negligibly small outside @xmath13 ) , then @xmath14 measures how much the frequency @xmath6 contributes to the portion of @xmath1 that lives on the interval @xmath15 centered at @xmath16 .    to obtain the inversion formula for the operator @xmath17",
    ", we observe that the map @xmath18 is the restriction to functions of the form @xmath19 of the linear map @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 @xmath22 is the composition of the measure - preserving change of variable @xmath23 with the fourier transform in the second variable , so it is unitary on @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that the windowed fourier transform is an isometry from @xmath24 into @xmath25 : @xmath26 therefore , we have @xmath27 , and an easy calculation of @xmath28 then yields the inversion formula @xmath29 ( as with the ordinary fourier transform , this integral is absolutely convergent only for @xmath1 in a dense subspace of @xmath0 and must be interpreted by a limiting process in general . )    let us look at this from another viewpoint . for @xmath30",
    "we introduce the _ modulation _ operator @xmath31 and the _ translation _ operator @xmath32 by @xmath33 thus @xmath34 t_xm_\\om f(t)&=\\hbox{e}^{\\tpi\\om\\cdot(t - x)}f(t - x)= \\hbox{e}^{-\\tpi\\om\\cdot x}m_\\om t_xf(t),\\phantom{0}\\hskip -1pc\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and and become @xmath35 that is , we are using the time - frequency translates ( i.e. , translates and modulates ) of @xmath8 , @xmath36 , as a ` basic set ' of functions by means of which one can express an arbitrary @xmath0 function @xmath1 .",
    "however , the set @xmath37 is highly overcomplete , and in general one can expand an arbitrary @xmath1 using only a suitable discrete subset of it .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is the characteristic function of the unit cube @xmath38^d$ ] , the set @xmath39 is actually an orthonormal basis for @xmath24 .",
    "( it is the basis one obtains by tiling @xmath2 by cubes of unit side length with vertices in the integer lattice and using the usual fourier basis on each cube . )",
    "such discrete ` basic sets ' have an obvious advantage from a computational point of view , as integrals must be approximated by discrete sums for numerical work anyway .",
    "we are thus led to the following definition .    given @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "let @xmath42 @xmath43 is called the _",
    "gabor system _ determined by @xmath44 .",
    "( the name is in honor of the electrical engineer d  gabor , who suggested in his ground - breaking paper of 1946 @xcite that @xmath45 should be a useful ` basic set ' .",
    "he was not entirely correct   see 3.4 of @xcite   but the essential idea was still a good one . ) evidently this concept can be  generalized : one can consider @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a more general discrete subset of @xmath48 .",
    "we shall consider such generalizations later , but we stick with the lattice @xmath49 for now .    the first question that must be addressed is the following : _ for which @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 does @xmath43 span @xmath24 _ ?",
    "( by ` span ' we mean that its finite linear span is dense in @xmath24 . )",
    "this question , as it stands , is too broad to admit a reasonable answer . in particular , if one is given @xmath8 , the set of @xmath53 for which @xmath43 spans @xmath0 depends strongly on @xmath8 . for example , if @xmath54 and @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) is supported in an interval of length @xmath56 , for @xmath43 to span @xmath0 it is obviously necessary that @xmath57 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "no matter what @xmath8 is , it is always necessary that the lattice @xmath59 should be sufficiently dense in @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , we have the following :    if @xmath60 , there is no @xmath61 such that @xmath43 spans @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath60 and @xmath62 is rational , daubechies @xcite has shown how to produce , for any given @xmath8 , an explicit @xmath63 such that @xmath64 .",
    "( see also p.  107 of @xcite for the very easy case where @xmath65 , @xmath66 . ) however , when @xmath62 is irrational , a deeper argument is necessary .",
    "the reason for this rather surprising distinction lies in the structure of the group of operators @xmath67 generated by the modulations and translations @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) . in view of",
    ", we have @xmath71 this group is a homomorphic image of the _ discrete heisenberg group _ @xmath72 whose underlying set is @xmath73 and whose group law is @xmath74 ( this is often written with the roles of @xmath75 and @xmath76 switched . )",
    "indeed , the map @xmath77 is easily seen to be a unitary representation of @xmath72 whose image is @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath62 is irrational , @xmath78 is an isomorphism of groups . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath62 is rational , say @xmath79 in lowest terms , we have @xmath80 and hence @xmath81 the group law again being given by with addition mod @xmath82 in the last coordinate .",
    "now , observe that @xmath83 is both the center and the commutator subgroup of @xmath72 .",
    "the group @xmath84 is ` almost abelian ' : its commutator subgroup is finite , and it has normal abelian subgroups of finite index ( for example , @xmath85 ) . as a result , the harmonic analysis of @xmath84 can be reduced to _",
    "abelian _ harmonic analysis . but",
    "@xmath72 itself is a discrete group that is _ not _ ` almost abelian , ' and consequently it is not even type  i. this means that its harmonic analysis exhibits various pathologies and involves queer beasts such as von neumann factors of type  ii ( see chapter  7 of @xcite for a fuller explanation of these matters ) .    in 2",
    "we develop the basic properties of the von neumann algebra generated by @xmath67 , and in 3 we discuss several proofs of theorem  1 .",
    "we now turn to a different question .",
    "suppose that @xmath43 does span @xmath0 ; can we use it in an efficient way to expand an arbitrary @xmath86 ?",
    "the condition that allows everything to work smoothly is that @xmath43 should be a _ frame _ for @xmath0 .",
    "the notion of frame was introduced by duffin and schaeffer in 1952 , but it was not fully exploited until a third of a century later , when daubechies _",
    "et  al _ @xcite showed how handy frames could be in signal analysis .",
    "we make a brief detour into abstract hilbert space theory to explain this idea ; see @xcite or @xcite for a fuller discussion .    a bit of notation that will be employed throughout this paper :",
    "if @xmath13 is a discrete set , we denote functions on @xmath13 by lower - case boldface letters such as @xmath87 , and the value of @xmath87 at @xmath88 is denoted by @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 be a separable hilbert space .",
    "a  countable set @xmath91 is called a _",
    "frame _ for @xmath90 if there exist @xmath92 such that for all @xmath93 we have the ` frame inequalities ' @xmath94 the second inequality in means that the linear map @xmath95 from @xmath90 to functions on @xmath13 defined by @xmath96 is bounded from @xmath90 to @xmath97 .",
    "its adjoint @xmath98 is easily seen to be @xmath99 , where the series converges unconditionally .",
    "the composition @xmath100 , given by @xmath101 is called the _ frame",
    "operator_. since @xmath102 , the frame inequalities are equivalent to the operator inequalities @xmath103 ; in particular , @xmath104 is invertible , and its inverse satisfies @xmath105 . since @xmath106 these inequalities in turn",
    "imply that @xmath107 is again a frame ( with frame constants @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) ; it is called the _ dual frame_. the two frames @xmath110 and @xmath111 can now be used together to produce expansion formulas for a general @xmath93 in terms of either frame : @xmath112 f&=s^\\inv(sf)=s^\\inv\\left(\\sum \\langle f , e_i\\rangle e_i\\right ) = \\sum \\langle f , e_i\\rangle s^\\inv e_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now return to the gabor system @xmath43 .",
    "if this system is a frame , an easy calculation shows that the frame operator @xmath104 commutes with every @xmath68 and @xmath69 , so the dual frame is again a gabor system , namely , @xmath113 ; we call @xmath114 the _ dual window _",
    "to@xmath8 .",
    "incidentally , theorem  1 implies that _ if there exists @xmath40 such that @xmath43 is a frame , then @xmath115 _ , but this result is easier to prove than theorem  1 itself ( see p.  108 of @xcite or corollary  7.5.1 of @xcite ) .    in the applications of gabor systems ,",
    "one is generally interested in using windows with good time - frequency localization , that is , windows @xmath8 for which both @xmath8 and @xmath55 have reasonably rapid decay at infinity , or   what is more or less the same thing   that the windowed fourier transform @xmath116 , for some nice fixed window @xmath117 , has rapid decay in both @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "experience has shown that a good quantitative measure of this decay is given by the norms that characterize the so - called _ modulation spaces _",
    "@xmath118 , which are defined as follows .",
    "a _ subexponential weight _ on @xmath48 is a function @xmath119 of the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a seminorm on @xmath48 and @xmath122 is a nonnegative concave function on @xmath123 such that @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "( examples : @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 . )",
    "such a weight is always submultiplicative : @xmath131 . given a subexponential weight @xmath132 , the _ modulation space _",
    "@xmath133 is defined as latexmath:[\\[\\label{13 } m_v^1=\\left\\ { f\\in l^2(\\br^d)\\hbox{:}\\ \\|f\\|_{1,v}=\\int_{\\br^{2d } }    some fixed schwartz - class window ; @xmath118 turns out to be independent of the choice of @xmath117 , as is the equivalence class of the norm @xmath135 .",
    "evidently the notion of modulation space can be generalized   for example , by using an @xmath136 norm rather than the @xmath137 norm   but @xmath133 will suffice for our purposes . for a detailed treatment of modulation spaces we refer to chapter  11 of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "incidentally , @xmath138 ( i.e. , @xmath133 where @xmath139 ) is the feichtinger algebra , often denoted by @xmath140 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now , suppose @xmath8 is a window such that @xmath43 is a frame for @xmath24 . if @xmath8 has good time - frequency localization in the sense that @xmath141 for some suitable weight @xmath132 , it is obviously desirable that the dual window @xmath114 should also belong to @xmath118 .",
    "that this is indeed the case is the second major result we wish to discuss .",
    "suppose @xmath132 is a subexponential weight on @xmath48 and @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath141 is a window such that @xmath43 is a frame , then the frame operator @xmath104 maps @xmath118 bijectively onto itself .",
    "in particular , @xmath142 .",
    "this theorem was first proved by feichtinger and grchenig @xcite in the case where @xmath62 is rational .",
    "the general case is a more recent result of grchenig and leinert @xcite ; its proof involves some abstract machinery that was not needed for the rational case .",
    "the underlying reason for this dichotomy is the same as in theorem  1 : one needs a result about a noncommutative convolution on @xmath143 that is closely related to the group @xmath144 defined in .",
    "when @xmath62 is rational , these results can be obtained by abelian harmonic analysis , but the general case requires a different approach .    in more detail , the crucial ingredient for the proof of theorem  2 is a noncommutative analogue of a classic result of norbert wiener .",
    "wiener s theorem is usually stated as follows : _",
    "if @xmath1 is a continuous , nonvanishing , periodic function on @xmath145 whose fourier series is absolutely convergent , then the fourier series of @xmath146 is also absolutely convergent .",
    "_ however , by passing from @xmath1 to its sequence @xmath87 of fourier coefficients , this result can also be stated as a theorem about the convolution algebra @xmath147 .",
    "indeed , taking into account the fact that the nonvanishing of @xmath1 is equivalent to the invertibility of the operator @xmath148 on @xmath149 , and hence of the operator @xmath150 on @xmath151 , wiener s theorem can be restated as follows : _ suppose @xmath152 and the map @xmath150 is invertible as an operator on @xmath151 .",
    "then @xmath87 is invertible in the convolution algebra @xmath147 . _",
    "the setting for the noncommutative analogue of wiener s theorem is as follows .",

    "we also define an involution @xmath157 on @xmath155 by @xmath158 ( note : these definitions differ from the ones in @xcite by the minus signs in the exponents .",

    "we shall denote this algebra by @xmath163 : @xmath164 moreover , the obvious analogue of young s inequality holds : if @xmath165 , the operator @xmath166 is bounded on every @xmath167 with norm at most @xmath168 .",
    "the analogue of wiener s theorem is as follows :    if @xmath169 , then the spectrum of the operator @xmath170 as an operator on @xmath171 is equal to its spectrum as an operator on @xmath155 . in particular , if @xmath170 is invertible on @xmath171 , then @xmath172 is invertible in the algebra @xmath163 .",
