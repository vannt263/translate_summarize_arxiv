    "sound propagation in a dry confined granular medium still is , to a large extent , an open question . in particular , a long - standing puzzle is concerned with explaining the dependence of sound velocities on the externally applied pressure @xmath0 .",
    "the load bearing intergrain contacts which ensure the mechanical stability of the packing are of the hertz type , i.e. their longitudinal stiffness ( along the intercenter axis ) scales as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the corresponding load . as shown by mindlin@xcite",
    ", this scaling also holds , for frictional balls , for their shear stiffness , provided that the shear load borne by the contact is much smaller than the friction threshold .",
    "so , one intuitively expects that the velocity of , say , longitudinal sound @xmath6 .    however , experimental results depart strongly from this expectation : @xmath7 is found to exhibit a much faster @xmath0-dependence , which is commonly characterized by `` effective exponents '' @xmath8",
    ". values of @xmath9 of order roughly @xmath10 are often mentioned .",
    "such a behavior is observed for 3d random grain packings , which present what we will term `` strong topological disorder '' but also , more surprisingly , for artificially built regular arrays of quasi - monodisperse balls .",
    "this was first shown on a 3d f.c.c .",
    "lattice by duffy and mindlin@xcite , who found that the faster dependence with @xmath11 in the intermediate pressure range tended asymptotically , at high @xmath0 s , towards the hertz @xmath3 dependence .",
    "recently , coste and gilles@xcite have investigated in detail sound propagation in a 2d hexagonal lattice of steel balls .",
    "their experimental results for @xmath2 , which are qualitatively similar to those of duffy and mindlin , have motivated the present study .",
    "various explanations for this behavior for strongly disordered packings have been put forward . in particular",
    ", goddard@xcite proposed that a @xmath10 value of @xmath9 might originate from the existence of conical contacts , while de gennes@xcite suggested that the presence of heterogeneous shells surrounding the grain bodies might in some cases be relevant .",
    "a possibly more natural explanation lies in the pressure dependence of the numberof load bearing contacts in the packing .",
    "it has been at the center of several recent works .",
    "in particular , a direct numerical study by makse _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrates the correlation between number of contacts and sound velocity in a 3d system .    for regular arrays , such an explanation may at first appear doubtful",
    "however , j.n .",
    "roux@xcite has studied numerically the 2d h.c.p .",
    "structure and found that even a minute dispersion in ball radii leads to a similar effect .",
    "namely , due to purely geometrical constraints , as the pressure increases , the average number of contacts per ball @xmath12 varies from @xmath13 at the rigidity threshold to its maximum value of @xmath14 at high @xmath0 .",
    "although such effects seem to be within the reach of a mean field description , the various attempts in this direction have up to now failed to account for deviations from the hertz power law @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . as already suggested by makse _",
    "et al._@xcite , we believe this to result from the central but implicit assumption of these models that the local contact arrangement deforms homothetically when @xmath0 changes .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the essential effect of local stress inhomogeneities : due to the elastic hertz deformations , they result in a dispersion of intercenter distances , and hence of the bond strengths . in other words , even in the absence of a change in contact number , the change of bond stiffness induced by a pressure change is non affine .",
    "while it is certainly very difficult to improve upon this approximation in the case of strong topological disorder , the case of a periodic array of weakly disperse balls seems amenable to a realistic description .",
    "indeed , in this case , the existence of a reference lattice permits to formulate a mean field theory in the spirit of the single center self - consistent cpa approach@xcite , developed already long ago to describe the electronic properties of metallic alloys . such a route was already explored in a series of articles on depleted elastic networks@xcite , @xcite . however , in these works , the distribution of active contacts was assumed to be known and independent of the external stress , and the self - consistent condition was formulated in terms of a single bond approximation , in the spirit of kirkpatrick s approach to percolation problems@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we build an effective medium description of a 2d h.c.p .",
    "array of hertz - mindlin balls which does account for local deformation due to the disorder in ball radii .",
    "in contrast with previous theories , our self - consistency condition does depend on the global external stress .",
    "clearly , in such a system , the higher the external pressure , the smaller the relative disorder .",
    "so , our mean field appears as a high-@xmath0 expansion .",
    "it therefore complements the numerical studies of roux , which deal with the low-@xmath0 regime where percolation effects are dominant .",
    "we show that our predictions account quantitatively for the experimental results of gilles and coste .",
    "moreover , comparison with roux s results in an overlapping intermediate pressure range allows us to determine the range of validity of our effective medium approach .",
    "we find that it holds down to pressures where @xmath12 has decreased by about @xmath15 of its saturation value . from all this ,",
    "we conclude that the basic physical effect responsible for departures from the @xmath3 law is , rather than the variation of contact number in itself , the disorder induced spatial stress fluctuations .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we set the basis of our model by writing the dynamical equations for a set of hertz - mindlin contacts under equilibrium forces aligned with the intercenter directions , and solve them for an ideal lattice of perfectly identical balls . in section iii",
    ", we build up our mean field description , apply it to the h.c.p .",
    "lattice , and obtain from it the equation of state , i.e. the force - displacement relation from which the effective bulk and shear moduli are derived .",
    "section iv compares in detail the mean field predictions with the experimental and numerical results .",
    "let us first consider two spherical balls , labeled @xmath16 , of radii @xmath17 , made of the same material of young modulus @xmath18 , poisson ratio @xmath19 , density @xmath20 .",
    "the balls at equilibrium are in hertz contact@xcite under a force @xmath21 directed along the intercenter axis @xmath22 , i.e. normal to the contact circle",
    ".    the normal force @xmath21 displaces the intercenter distance from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , and : @xmath25 due to solid friction , when submitted to a tangential force smaller than the friction threshold @xmath26 , the contact is pinned and can not slide .",
    "the elastic response of this system to small additional forces @xmath27 in the @xmath28 plane is described , in the linear approximation , by two stiffness coefficients , given by the hertz - mindlin expressions , namely @xcite :    1 .",

    "( tangential ) stiffness : @xmath31    let us insist here that the fact that the ratio @xmath32 is a mere material parameter , independent of the values of the equilibrium forces , only holds for the case of a purely normal equilibrium loading , which we assume here to be the case . in the general situation with a finite equilibrium tangential load @xmath33 , @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "in all the following , we will restrict ourselves to situations where all ( equilibrium and non - equilibrium ) interball forces are near normal , so that both the static and dynamic shear responses are described by the linear shear stiffness ( equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) ) .",
    "small displacements of the balls can be decomposed into rigid translations @xmath35 , and rotations about @xmath36 by angles @xmath37 . denoting",
    "@xmath38 the unit vectors normal and tangent to the @xmath39 contact with @xmath40 directed from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) , one immediately finds that the force and torque on ball @xmath41 associated with the @xmath39 contact read respectively : @xmath43\\hat{\\bf n}_{ij}\\\\ & & + \\eta   k_{ij}[({\\bf u}_{i}-{\\bf u}_{j } ) .",

    "we now consider the ideal case of a 2d h.c.p .",
    "lattice of balls of equal diameters @xmath47 prepared so that , at equilibrium , the interball forces , of magnitude @xmath21 , are directed along the normals to the contacts @xmath48 ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "such a `` hydrostatic '' configuration can be realized by applying a force per unit length @xmath49 on a hexagonal container with walls along the dense ball rows , as realized in @xcite .",
    "the unit cell is defined by the two vectors @xmath50 , the ball centers by @xmath51 .",

    "the exact spectrum in the full brillouin zone , computed for @xmath58 along two directions of high symmetry , is shown on figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "it can be inferred from these results that , in this close - packed lattice , the anisotropy of the spectrum is small .    in the elastic continuum , long wavelength limit @xmath59 ,",
    "decomposing the translation amplitude into its longitudinal and transverse components : @xmath60 , one finds that the vibration spectrum , which is isotropic due to the hexagonal symmetry of the lattice , is composed of three branches :    1 .",
    "pure longitudinal acoustic modes of frequency @xmath61 , where the longitudinal sound velocity @xmath7 is given by : @xmath62 2 .",
    "two branches of mixed modes containing both a transverse translational and a rotational component .",
    "one of them is acoustic : @xmath63 , where the transverse sound velocity reads : @xmath64 the second , which corresponds to pure rotation in the @xmath65 limit , is an optical branch , defined by : @xmath66    that is , as already shown by schwartz _",
    "@xcite , the specificity of the vibration spectra of granular systems in frictional hertz contact , as compared with atomic systems , lies in the additional degree of freedom associated with ball rotation .",
    "this remains coupled , in the long wavelength limit , with shear deformation , leading to a contribution @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "also shown on figure [ fig:2 ] are the long wavelength dispersion curves .",
    "they can be seeen to provide a good approximation for the exact spectrum in a sizeable fraction of the brillouin zone .",
    "it is worth recalling , at this point , that our equations of motion cease to be valid when the frequency approaches that of the lowest acoustic resonance of a ball : @xmath69 , with @xmath70 a sound velocity of the material constituting the balls .",
    "indeed , in this situation , elastic deformations are no longer localized in a small region of extension on the order of the contact radius , internal deformations become important , and the restoring forces can no longer be described simply via the hertz - mindlin stiffnesses . roughly speaking",
    ", this means that our expressions for the acoustic branches of the spectrum are valid provided that @xmath71 . in view of equations ( [ eq:13 ] ) , ( [ eq:14 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) ,",
    "this simply amounts to @xmath72 , which is realized under ordinary experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "note that this condition is equivalent to stating that the radius of the hertz contact circle must be much smaller that the ball radius , which is precisely the condition for the hertz approach to hold .    from planar continuum elasticity",
    "applied to a medium with hexagonal symmetry , the velocities of sound waves with propagation and polarization directions in the basal plane read : @xmath73 with @xmath74 the mass density of the medium , @xmath75 and @xmath76 its bulk and shear moduli .",
    "comparison between these expressions and equations ( [ eq:13 ] ) , ( [ eq:14 ] ) enables us to define elastic moduli for our ball lattice - a result which will be of use in the disordered case .",
    "they read : @xmath77 where @xmath74 is related to the density of the ball material by : @xmath78 .",
    "consider an ensemble of balls whose material parameters are identical , while their diameters vary at random with a continuous or discrete statistical distribution .",

    "the mean diameter @xmath47 of a set of @xmath83 such balls may be obtained by configuration average , which we will denote by @xmath84 : @xmath85 we define the random deviations by @xmath86 in actual computations , we will use the uniform distribution with full width @xmath87 , which means @xmath88 .",
    "one sample ( configuration ) of the random h.c.p .",
    "array of balls may be created by randomly distributing the balls in an uncorrelated way over the sites of a reference h.c.p .",
    "the number of balls is assumed to be sufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit to be approached .",
    "the sample is then random , but macroscopically homogeneous .",
    "the balls are brought into contact and further compressed by external compressive forces applied to the sample boundaries so that the average internal stress is hydrostatic . an easy way of achieving this is to assume a hexagon shaped sample and to apply to all its sides the same macroscopic pressure force . the pressure force per unit length @xmath0 will be denoted henceforth _ linear pressure _ . under this pressure , the size of the compressed sample is reduced , while the symmetry of the lattice is preserved on average .",
    "it is thus meaningful to introduce an _ average lattice spacing @xmath89 _ as a macroscopic parameter having a thermodynamic limit and globally characterizing the state of the sample .",
    "the pressure and the size of the compressed system are related by _",
    "the macroscopic equation of state _ for the random lattice under hydrostatic compression .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce it in the form    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the functional dependence in question and @xmath21 denotes the _ average intergrain hydrostatic force _ associated with the linear pressure @xmath0 .",
    "the _ effective normal stiffness @xmath92 _ , and the effective bulk modulus @xmath93 are then given by @xmath94 as for the @xmath47 factor on the left hand side , _ cf . _",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) .    while the global characteristics , @xmath0 and @xmath89 , have thermodynamic limits , the ball positions and contact forces are subject to pronounced fluctuations , in particular for small external loads . in experiments ,",
    "this double nature of the disordered state is manifested by the coexistence of coherent signals and irregular speckles in the acoustic response @xcite , @xcite , in numerical simulations most clearly by the formation of force chains @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us first verify that the geometrical disorder can be taken as small , as demanded is sec . iia .",
    "if the relative diameter spread is small , the equilibrium disordered system can be treated , for any external pressure , as a distorted lattice .",
    "the balls are slightly displaced , and , in the case of frictional balls , the contact points may be somewhat off the intercenter lines , which gives rise to non - normal contact forces .",
    "taking as representative the data of @xcite , @xmath95 m , @xmath96 mm for steel balls , we see that the relative dispersion in `` bond '' lengths is of the order of @xmath97 . by geometrical considerations",
    ", this corresponds to deviations of the direction of the contact force from the normal also of about @xmath97 radian .",
    "these figures indicate that the geometrical disorder in this case is small indeed .",
    "fluctuations in the magnitude of the random contact forces , by contrast , may be quite large . by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , the contact force as a function of intercenter distance is given by @xmath98 as indicated by the underbrace in ( [ eq:22 ] ) , it is consistent to neglect the randomness of @xmath99 .",
    "namely , the fractional fluctuation of @xmath100 is @xmath101 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the disorder of the last factor in ( [ eq:22 ] ) is crucial : for the hertz displacement @xmath102 , the ratio @xmath103 may be large or small depending on the degree of compression of the balls , while both basic conditions , @xmath104 ( small disorder ) , and @xmath105 ( hertzian picture ) , remain satisfied .",
    "we may thus envisage three different regimes :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now , we require that _ the total equilibrium force on ball 1 vanishes _ , and subtract from this condition the equilibrium condition for the effective lattice : @xmath106 only the component parallel to the 01 connecting line is non - trivial . with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq:31 ] ) it reduces to a single equation for a single unknown , the corona radial displacement , with the solution @xmath107 where @xmath108 is again a geometrical factor .",
    "the equation has a simple interpretation . for a given @xmath80 ,",
    "the difference between the force exerted by the inclusion and the average force gives rise to a radial displacement .",
    "its magnitude is related to the force by an _ additively renormalized stiffness _ reflecting the fact that the corona is supported by the rest of the ( effective ) lattice . in the mean field context , this renormalization is a _ local field correction _ , and the parameter @xmath109 measures its dimensionless strength .",
    "now , we may impose the _ self - consistency condition _ , requiring that the average displacement be zero : @xmath110 where the argument of all functions is @xmath89 .",
    "this equation can be rearranged by introducing : @xmath111 the first quantity is easily recognized as identical with the averaged force of eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) of the afa in the preceding subsection .",
    "the second quantity is an averaged radial stiffness of the lattice surrounding a single ball inclusion .",
    "the ema condition ( [ eq:35 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath112 the average hydrostatic force for a given lattice spacing is seen to contain two contributions .",
    "first , the averaged contact force , and , second , a term having the characteristic structure of a second - order correlator , known from cpa - like theories .",
    "the second term is also responsible for the peculiar self - consistent character of the equation ( [ eq:38 ] ) .",
    "it is not the unknown @xmath91 itself which appears on its r.h.s . , but its derivative @xmath113 , and ( [ eq:38 ] ) has the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a complicated but well defined function .",
    "the ema equation is thus a first order differential equation determining @xmath91 as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , we meet here a case where self - consistency can not be written directly for an isolated value of the control parameter @xmath89 , but involves intrinsically the whole functional dependence @xmath116 .",
    "to select the physically relevant solution of ( [ eq:39 ] ) , we choose the _ high pressure asymptotic boundary condition _ @xmath117 it can be explicitly verified from([eq:38 ] ) that the contact of @xmath91 with @xmath118 stipulated by ( [ eq:40 ] ) is of second order , so that the boundary condition is formally justified .",
    "physically , this condition means that the ema coincides with the afa in the asymptotic limit of high pressures , but extends the mean field description of the system to an intermediate pressure region .",
    "we may also say that our ema is a self - consistent resummation of the high pressure perturbation expansion for the equation of state @xmath116 .",
    "the solution of the ema equation ( [ eq:39 ] ) is obtained without difficulty by numerical iteration starting from @xmath119 .      the case of frictional balls",
    "is very important for a proper comparison with existing experimental data . a formal development of the ema for frictional balls can proceed quickly , because the steps are almost identical with those made for the non - frictional case .",
    "it is necessary , however , to extend the description of the effective medium .",
    "as before , it is assumed to be composed of effective balls with diameter @xmath89 , interacting through effective contacts .",
    "in addition to the average hydrostatic force @xmath91 and the normal stiffness @xmath120 , we have to postulate also a local shear ( tangential ) stiffness @xmath121 as a third basic characteristic of the effective contact . for @xmath121",
    ", we formulate our basic _ conjecture _ : @xmath122 in words , the effective shear and compressive stiffnesses are related in the same manner as the two stiffnesses for actual hertz - mindlin contacts ( see eq.([eq:6 ] ) ) .",
    "we will discuss this intuitively appealing conjecture below , but first derive the ema equations following the preceding paragraph step by step .",
    "the central ball inclusion and its symmetrized corona are introduced without changes , and both figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] remain valid . because of the symmetry of the cluster , there is no torque acting on either the central or the corona balls , and only the force equilibrium has to be considered .",
    "the central ball is equilibrated automatically , and we inspect the forces acting on the corona ball 1 , linearized again with respect to the small displacements .",
    "the full expression ( [ eq:5 ] ) must be used now .",
    "the relative displacements remain radial for all the neighbors of ball 1 , except for the @xmath123 and @xmath124 ones ( see figure [ fig:4 ] . for @xmath125s , the contact force has a shear component , @xmath126 and similarly for @xmath127 . finally ,",
    "the displacements @xmath128 obey , in the linear elasticity regime , universal relations similar to ( [ eq:32 ] ) , @xmath129 where the @xmath130 and @xmath123 parameters depend now on the stiffness ratio @xmath131 , as indicated .",
    "introducing eqs .",
    "( [ eq:41 ] )  ( [ eq:43 ] ) into the equilibrium condition ( [ eq:33 ] ) , which is fully general , we obtain the corona radial displacement as @xmath132 in complete analogy with the frictionless case , eq .",
    "( [ eq:34 ] ) .",
    "the only change is an @xmath131-dependent geometrical factor , which reads now @xmath133    the ema condition @xmath134 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:36 ] ) , has a universal character , and with @xmath135 given by ( [ eq:44 ] ) , it can be brought successively to various explicit forms following strictly eqs.([eq:36 ] )  ( [ eq:39 ] ) , with @xmath109 of eq.([eq:35 ] ) replaced everywhere by @xmath136 as given by ( [ eq:45 ] ) . for convenience , we present here the final form of the ema , @xmath137 the corresponding boundary condition ( [ eq:40 ] ) is @xmath131-independent .",
    "the two complementary cases , frictional and non - frictional , are thus given by the same differential equation with the same boundary condition .",
    "they are only distinguished by the value of the @xmath136 parameter , which corresponds to @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "in other words , the difference between the two physical situations is reflected in the ema through the strength of the local field correction appearing in the renormalized contact stiffness .      to complete the ema analysis of our granular system ,",
    "let us now derive the expressions for the sound velocities .",
    "macroscopically , the averaged system is a periodic h.c.p .",
    "structure , so that it is acoustically isotropic and there exist just two sound velocities @xmath140 and @xmath141 , as in the ideal lattice of sec . iib .",
    "there , we proceeded from the full dispersion law in the brillouin zone to the long wave limit ( eqs.([eq:13 ] ) , ( [ eq:14 ] ) ) , then to the elastic moduli ( [ eq:17 ] ) on the basis of the macroscopic ( continuum ) relations ( [ eq:16 ] ) .    for the disordered system , we shall go in the reverse direction .",
    "the ema yields directly the equation of state @xmath116 and the effective compressive stiffness @xmath142 .",
    "the equation of state is a monotonous function of @xmath89 and thus can be inverted into @xmath143 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) ) , we obtain finally the average lattice spacing as a function of the linear pressure @xmath0 , and any function of @xmath89 , such as the bulk modulus , can be converted into a function of the pressure .",
    "the bulk modulus is obtained from the stiffness @xmath92 using eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed that eqs .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) and ( [ eq:21 ] ) have an identical form ; in fact , ( [ eq:17 ] ) as far as it concerns the bulk modulus is but a special case of ( [ eq:21 ] ) for zero disorder .",
    "as concerns the shear modulus , since our method only allows for treating the effect of hydrostatic stresses , we resort to an _ ansatz _ , i.e. , we propose to extend relation ( [ eq:17 ] ) for @xmath76 to the disordered case .",
    "we then get : @xmath144 while the first relation is exact , we should discuss the meaning of the second one .",
    "it turns out that the equivalent relation ( [ eq:17 ] ) for the ideal array is a direct consequence of the mindlin ratio ( [ eq:6 ] ) between near - normal stiffnesses and does not depend on the specific value or character of the compressive stiffness .",
    "thus , the second of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:47 ] ) is in fact equivalent to our conjecture ( [ eq:41 ] ) about the ratio of effective stiffnesses , @xmath145 .",
    "once the effective moduli are known , the sound velocities become @xmath146 equations ( [ eq:47 ] ) then predict for the velocity ratio that @xmath147 this is a very strong prediction , according to which the velocity ratio should depend neither on the pressure nor on the disorder level , being fully determined by the material properties of the grains . while conjecture ( [ eq:41 ] ) is not susceptible of direct verification , the predicted sound velocity ratio can be tested for a wide range of systems .",
    "note that a similar conjecture concerning this ratio was formulated earlier by schwartz and johnson @xcite .",
    "we first confront our mean field predictions with the experimental data obtained by gilles and coste @xcite , obtained on an h.c.p .",
    "lattice of steel balls confined by a hexagonal frame under hydrostatic loading .",
    "they measured the time of flight of a low frequency sound pulse between two opposite sides of the frame . from this",
    "we obtain the longitudinal sound velocity @xmath148 , where @xmath21 is the average equilibrium contact force ( eq.([eq:20 ] ) .",
    "the experimental data show that , at the highest loadings used , @xmath7 approaches closely the @xmath3 hertz behavior .",
    "this confirms that , in this regime , the applied pressure is high enough for disorder effects to be weak , and for the compressed lattice to be close to the ideal h.c.p .",
    "we therefore focus first on the data for the largest forces used in the experiments .",
    "for example , an external force of @xmath149n applied on each side of a hexagon with 31 balls in contact with each side corresponds to @xmath150n . taking for steel @xmath151pa , @xmath152 , @xmath153kg.m@xmath154 , ball diameters @xmath155 mm , we get from eqs .",

    "the frictional character of the contacts ( @xmath139 ) leads to underestimating the longitudinal velocity by @xmath160 , well out of the experimental error bar . for the transverse velocity",
    ", the two values would differ by @xmath161 , but no experimental data are available . these differences in velocities are clearly reflected in the different slopes of the dispersion curves for the frictional and non - frictional cases in fig . [ fig:2 ] .    with the values of @xmath140 at hand",
    ", we may return to the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "iib and check first the validity of the hertz approach .",
    "the bulk sound velocities for the above material parameters of steel are @xmath162m.sec@xmath157 , @xmath163m.sec@xmath157 and we may conclude that the condition @xmath164 is obeyed . to verify the validity of the continuum limit , we have to invoke the ground frequency of the pulses used in the experiments , @xmath165hz .",

    "it is clearly seen that the high pressure data fit the straight line corresponding to the ideal lattice . as @xmath21 decreases , the logarithmic slope increases , coming close to the popular @xmath169 value . however , no sharp crossover is identifiable , the transition being completely smooth .",
    "we then solve the mean field equation numerically .",
    "all parameters are known , except for the width of the distribution of ball diameters .",
    "diameter scatter is only qualified , in the experiment , through a tolerance of @xmath170 m .",
    "we assume a uniform distribution whose width @xmath171 is our single fitting parameter .",
    "we find that the best fit is obtained for @xmath172 m , compatible with the tolerance figure .",
    "the fit itself is seen to be very good in the whole experimental range .",
    "the ema is shown both for frictional and non - frictional balls .",
    "the results are only weakly sensitive to the value of @xmath131 , at striking variance with the sound velocity itself . for the latter quantity , however , the @xmath131 dependence enters primarily through the @xmath173 ratio .",
    "the experimental @xmath21-range is limited , on the low force side , to @xmath174n .",
    "furthermore , no direct measurement of the equation of state @xmath116 is available yet .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to complement the above comparison with a confrontation between mean field predictions and the simulations performed by roux@xcite on the same system for frictionless balls with a uniform random distribution of diameters .",
    "applied forces span the whole range from almost zero up to the upper experimental limit .",
    "the comparison for the equation of state is shown on figure [ fig:6 ] , which is drawn in the dimensionless representation used in reference @xcite : @xmath175 in these units , the exact equation of state @xmath176 is a universal function @xcite , if approximation ( [ eq:22 ] ) is used .",
    "it is easy to verify on eq .",
    "( [ eq:38 ] ) that the ema has the same property .    clearly , @xmath177 . for @xmath178 ,",
    "the balls barely start touching , @xmath179 is the so - called rigidity threshold , below which the disordered lattice can not sustain compression .",
    "@xmath180 is the region where all neighbors are already in contact , and @xmath181 is the high pressure limit . in a narrow range above the rigidity threshold , a quasi - hertz regime is found , followed , in the intermediate force range , by a steeper variation .",
    "the mean field result shown here , also calculated for frictionless balls , appears to agree with the numerical data for @xmath182 .",
    "also shown are the curves corresponding to the ala and to the afa .",
    "they frame the exact and the ema results from below and from above , respectively .",
    "for high pressures , all plots merge .",
    "we replot the same data in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] using the linear scale for the lattice spacing , and the @xmath183 power scale for the forces , so that the natural range of various regimes can be better assessed . in particular , note the striking improvement of ema over the afa for intermediate pressures .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we return to the experimentally more relevant stiffness - force dependence and plot in dimensionless form the mean - field and the ala curves , the data from roux s numerical simulations and their power law approximants , and also the experimental data of gilles and coste .",
    "these data are scaled using @xmath184 m and the force unit @xmath185n .",
    "the overall agreement is truly satisfactory , which is all the more remarkable that , while experiments and mean field are concerned with frictional balls , the simulations relate to the frictionless case .",
    "this is to be related with our previous observation that , in the h.c.p .",
    "lattice studied here , the normal stiffness is only weakly sensitive to shear interball forces",
    ". such might not be the case for other ball arrays .",
    "as is well known , since mean field theories are not systematic expansions in powers of a small parameter , they do not allow for a precise direct assessment of their range of validity . from this discussion , we can state empirically that the validity of our effective medium approximation is limited to dimensionless forces @xmath186 .",
    "this we confirm by calculating , within the mean field approximation itself , the relative force fluctuations @xmath187 , and @xmath188 , where @xmath189    the plot of figure [ fig:9 ] shows that the relative fluctuations decrease rapidly with increasing displacement , i.e. pressure , the above mentioned empirical limit corresponding to the reasonable value @xmath190 .",
    "the reduction of the local stress ( force ) fluctuations due to the self - consistent local displacements is reflected in the relative magnitude of the ema and afa fluctuations .",
    "the frictionless balls appear to adjust their positions more effectively , as could be expected .",
    "finally , we have estimated the average fraction of active contacts per ball @xmath12 in our effective lattice in the following way .",
    "we define it to be the average number of neighbors with an intercenter distance smaller than the sum of the corresponding radii .",
    "@xmath191 note that this expression does not derive systematically from the mean field formalism , in which the notion of contact number does not enter explicitly .",
    "it should therefore be considered as indicative only .",
    "@xmath12 is plotted on figure [ fig:10 ] together with the values calculated by roux .",
    "expression ( [ eq : number ] ) is seen to systematically underestimate @xmath12 .",
    "it appears that the validity of the mean field extends down to @xmath192 .",
    "however , it is important to point out that the pressure range where the sound velocity departs from the hertz behavior extends well into the pressure range where the contact fraction has already saturated to @xmath193 .",
    "this corroborates strongly the idea that it is not the connectivity itself which is responsible for the non - hertz behavior , but the presence of disorder - induced stress fluctuations .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] , where we plot together the ema results for @xmath194 , @xmath195 and the ratio @xmath196 .",
    "this latter quantity is a direct measure of the deviations of the effective stiffness from the ideal hertz law .",
    "no sharp change of regime occurs at saturation of @xmath194 , the non - hertz behavior and stress fluctuations appear to extend to higher pressures and gradually tend to zero together .",
    "on the basis of the above discussion , we are therefore able to conclude that our mean field theory provides quite a satisfactory description of the pressure dependence of the bulk mechanical properties , and hence of the sound velocity , in an array of frictional balls in the `` high '' pressure range .",
    "this corresponds to the regime in which the ball network is strongly overdetermined , that is where connectivity is close to its saturation value .",
    "we believe that this agreement , which permits to account for the non - hertzian behavior down to the @xmath197 range , is due to the fact that this theory does capture , though in an approximate manner , the existence of disorder induced stress fluctuations , and that these are self - consistently related with the global mechanical state of the system . in other words , the true disorder strength in the problem is not intrinsically given by the dispersion of unstressed ball diameters , but determined from this @xmath198 the elastic deformation field .    we have based our single - site description upon the simplest possible approximation , which amounts to a spherical averaging of local lattice distorsions . that this is sufficient to produce a satisfactory theory",
    "must certainly be attributed to the high connectivity of the h.c.p . structure .",
    "it should for this reason be applicable as well to a 3d lattice such as the fcc one .",
    "systematic improvement upon this approximation is possible .",
    "this should be based on extending the basic building block from our ( central ball + average bond star ) to a full cluster made of the central ball and of its six neighbors .",
    "such an extension , although obviously heavy , would have the merit of explicitly allowing for local asymmetric configurations , which we have ignored here .",
    "it would also be a first step towards taking into account spatial stress correlations , which are completely overlooked in the present approach .    in view of this last remark ,",
    "the good agreement obtained here with sound velocity data calls for a physical comment .",
    "coherent sound measures a mechanical response on the scale of the corresponding effective wavelength which , in the low frequency regime of the gilles - coste experiments , is at least of the order of 10 ball diameters , as discussed in sec .",
    "it is now well documented @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that the correlation length of the stress network in granular packings is , at most , of order a few @xmath47 .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that mean field theories , though by nature unable to capture long range correlations , are well adapted to describe large scale properties .",
    "that is , when focussing on large scale mechanical responses , the pertinent notion is that of a global fluctuating stress network .",
    "the complementary notion of stress chains , which emphasizes the long range part of correlations , is certainly more relevant to the question of acoustic scattering , which becomes essential at higher frequencies .",
    "obviously , an important pending question is concerned with the possibility of extending the mean field approach to the more important case of topologically disordered random grain packings .",
    "such a step , however desirable it might be , is by no means straightforward , as can be inferred from the , yet insuperable , difficulties which have been met when trying to extend the theories of electronic and vibrational properties of random substitutional alloys to amorphous materials .",
    "these can be assigned to the absence of a natural reference configuration possessing long range order . up",
    "to now , the only existing theoretical frame for amorphous solids is a structureless , homogeneous effective medium .",
    "this would amount in the present problem to treating the effective medium in the continuum limit , which is clearly inedequate to account for stress fluctuation effects . in this perspective",
    ", numerical studies appear essential as a basis for trying to build up the needed original theoretical concepts .",
    "however , we believe that the qualitative idea which emerges from this work , namely that it is the disorder induced stress fluctuations which are responsible for the pressure dependence of the sound velocity in granular packings , will carry over , as well , to topologically disordered systems",
