    "v1432  aquilae ( rx j1940.1 - 1025 ) is an am  herculis ( polar ) system in which a white dwarf with a strong magnetic field accretes material from the roche lobe of a late - type dwarf companion star .",
    "it was discovered in the rosat pspc observations of the seyfert galaxy ngc  6814 ( madejski et al .",
    "staubert et al .",
    "( 1994 ) detected a period of 12120@xmath103  s in radial velocity of the h@xmath14 emission line using optical spectroscopy .",
    "the optical photometric and x - ray light curves of v1432  aql show an eclipse - like structure near orbital phase zero that provided a more accurate orbital period determination .",
    "watson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported an orbital period of 12116.3@xmath100.4  s using optical photometry and 12116.3@xmath100.01  s from combined optical and x - ray dip timings .",
    "further radial velocity measurements by patterson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and friedrich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) confirmed this period .",
    "watson et al . ( 1995 ) argue that the eclipse - like structure is due to absorption in the accretion stream ( see also schmidt & stockman 2001 ) . whereas , patterson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest that it is an eclipse by the secondary star .",
    "mukai et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and singh & rana ( 2003 ) ( hereafter paper 1 ) argue that this dip is likely a true eclipse by the secondary star based on the absence of any residual x - ray flux at minimum light .",
    "the orbital period of v1432  aql is well established from the well defined eclipses",
    ". the white dwarf spin period ( p@xmath15 ) is seen in the optical photometry ( patterson et al .",
    "1995 ) as well as in the x - ray data ( friedrich et al . 1996 ) .",
    "geckeler & staubert ( 1997 ) estimate the white dwarf spin period to be 12150  s from the changing nature of the accretion region relative to the magnetic pole in x - ray ( @xmath0 ) and optical photometry .",
    "recently , staubert et al . (",
    "2003 ) have provided an accurate ephemeris for the spin period using timings of spin minima obtained from the optical photometric and the x - ray data and also detected a secular decrease of 1.013 @xmath16 s / s in the spin period .",
    "they estimate a spin period of 12150.328@xmath100.045  s ( for epoch 1995.2 ) using combined optical and x - ray data .",
    "mukai et al .",
    "( 2003a ) report an analysis of extensive optical photometry and derive an ephemeris of the spin period ( 12150.432  s ) and confirm the presence of its time derivative p@xmath15=-9 @xmath17  s / s . based on these characteristics , v1432  aql",
    "is generally believed to be an asynchronous polar with the unusual characteristic of the spin period being slightly longer than the orbital period .",
    "however , mukai ( 1998 ) presented evidence for a spin period of @xmath184040  s using archival @xmath0 data and suggested reclassification of v1432  aql as an intermediate polar . in paper 1 ,",
    "singh & rana supported this conclusion by reporting the strongest peak of the power density spectrum at @xmath184070  s from the analysis of a continuous observation with @xmath2-@xmath3 .",
    "additional characteristics that further distinguish v1432  aql from other polars are the complex x - ray light - curves and the strong hard x - ray emission ( singh et al .",
    "2003 ) , which are commonly associated with the intermediate polars ( ips ) .    the accreting material in a polar or an ip forms a strong shock near the surface of the white dwarf that heats the gas to a high temperature ( @xmath19 k ) .",
    "the hot plasma in the post - shock region gradually cools and settles on to the surface of the white dwarf , emitting mainly in hard x - rays via thermal bremsstrahlung ( lamb & masters 1979 ) .",
    "therefore , the post - shock region can be considered to have a continuous temperature distribution , so the use of a multi - temperature plasma model to quantify the temperature distribution is necessary ( done , osborne & beardmore 1995 ) .",
    "the uv and soft x - ray components ( below 2 kev ) mainly arise because of the reprocessing of hard x - ray photons from the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "the soft x - ray spectral component can be modeled using blackbody emission that is usually dominant in polars .",
    "however , recently a few ips have been observed to show characteristics that are common to both ips and polars , and these are classified as soft ips ( haberl & motch 1995 ) .",
    "these systems rotate asynchronously where the binary period is considerably longer than the rotation period of the white dwarf , and their x - ray light curves are strongly modulated at the spin period .",
    "in addition to a soft x - ray component they also show polarized optical / ir emission due to electrons in the plasma spiraling in a strong ( @xmath20 b ) magnetic field , properties similar to that of polars .",
    "phase resolved x - ray spectroscopy of such systems can be particularly useful to learn about the origin of the phase dependent features and the complex absorption effects taking place in the source , and the @xmath2-@xmath3 observatory with its wide energy band and high sensitivity is an excellent instrument to study the spectral nature and its phase - dependent behaviour in polars and ips . with its moderate energy resolution",
    ", @xmath2-@xmath3 can also provide useful information about the fe line complex .",
    "simultaneous observations in the soft and hard x - ray energy bands provide important information about the energy balance in these systems .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 @xmath21 @xmath7 @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath2-@xmath3 observations from 1992 to 2002 .",
    "we also present an analysis of stokes photo - polarimetry obtained at the @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) in 1994 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the observations and analysis techniques .",
    "section 3 contains results from the timing analysis including the x - ray and the circular polarization power spectra and spin folded x - ray light curves .",
    "section 4 contains the results of the spectral analysis and a description of spectral models that are used to characterize the source .",
    "the results of the phase resolved spectroscopy are presented in  5 . in  6 , we discuss the timing and the spectral results , and compare them with other polars and ips .",
    "we conclude and summarize the results in  7 .",
    "v1432  aql was observed serendipitously with the @xmath0 ( trmper 1983 ) position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) in 19921993 during the observations of a nearby seyfert galaxy ngc  6814 .",
    "data from these observations were previously analyzed for temporal analysis by staubert et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , friedrich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , mukai ( 1998 ) , and staubert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . during the 1992 october observations ,",
    "most of the data were collected in last four days , hence for generating power spectra the data from only the last four days have been used ( i.e. 1992 october 2730 ) ( see mukai 1998 ) .",
    "the 1993 october observations were made at different offset ( 17@xmath27 ) than the other two ( 37@xmath27 ) .",
    "we have made no attempt to account for the different offsets because the light curves are folded separately and this will only affect the average intensity of the source and not the overall profile of the intensity modulation and the intrinsic variability of the source .",
    "we extracted the background subtracted source light curves in three energy bands of 0.10.5 kev ( soft ) , 0.52 kev ( medium ) and 0.12 kev ( total ) with a time resolution of 4  s , from a circle with a radius of @xmath28.5 centered on the peak position .",
    "we used the xselect program in ftools ( _ see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software.html_ ) and performed a detailed temporal analysis , exploiting the long baseline of the @xmath0 observations .",
    "the @xmath1 observatory ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) observed v1432  aql serendipitously during 1997 october 2729 while observing a high redshift quasar , pks 1937 - 101 .",

    "the light curves were extracted in two energy bands of 0.72 kev ( medium ) and 210 kev ( hard ) to facilitate a direct comparison with the light curves obtained from the @xmath0 and the @xmath2 observations .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 observatory ( jansen et al . 2001 ) observed v1432  aql _ continuously _ on 2001 october 9 for 25455  s with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) containing two mos ccds ( turner et al .",
    "the data from the epic pn camera were not available in the observing mode used and the counts in the reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs1 and rgs2 ; den herder et al .",
    "2001 ) were insufficient for a meaningful spectral analysis .",
    "we adopted an energy range of 0.210 kev ( a background flare affects the data above 10 kev ) for the light curve and time - averaged spectral analysis .",
    "x - ray spectra and light curves were extracted for mos1 and mos2 .",
    "we use the @xmath29 and @xmath30 sas ( science analysis system ver .",
    "5.4.1 ) tasks to generate the appropriate response files for both mos cameras .",
    "individual spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin to facilitate the use of @xmath31 minimization during the spectral fitting .",
    "x - ray light curves were extracted in 4 energy bands ; soft ( 0.20.5 kev ) , medium ( 0.52.0 kev ) , hard ( 210 kev ) , and total ( 0.210 kev ) such that the soft and medium bands correspond roughly to the @xmath0 soft and medium bands , respectively .",
    "@xmath2-@xmath3 light curves were presented in figure 1 of paper 1 .",
    "v1432  aql was observed twice with the @xmath9 proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) during 2002 july 1415 ( pi : p. barrett ) .",
    "the observations were done at an offset of @xmath1815@xmath27 from the source to minimize the contamination from the seyfert galaxy ngc  6814 which is @xmath32 away . at this offset the contamination from ngc  6814 is @xmath33% .",
    "the data were processed using the ftools version 5.2 following the standard procedure .",
    "we analyzed the pca standard 2 data with a time resolution of 16  s. for an improved signal - to - noise ratio , data in the 210 kev energy band from top xenon layer of all proportional counter units ( pcus ) were used to generate the source and the background light curves and spectra .",
    "the background light curve and spectrum were obtained using the appropriate background model corresponding to the epoch of each observations .",
    "only three of the five pcus were on during the two observations .",
    "however , data from pcu0 were rejected , because a propane leak resulted in a large background flare affecting the top layer data from pcu0 .",
    "data from only 2 pcus which are free from the background flare , were analyzed .",
    "stokes ( simultaneous linear and circular ) polarimetry data of v1432  aql were obtained using the university of cape town ( uct ) polarimeter ( cropper 1985 ) on the 1 m telescope of the saao during 1994 july 5 , 6 , 8 , and 1013 .",
    "most of the data were taken in white light ( no filter ) , though there were short periods of data taken with the b , v , cousins r , cousins i , and an extended red ( og570 ) filters .",
    "the integration time was 10  s for the photometry and @xmath185 minutes for the polarimetry .",
    "the ubvri filters were calibrated before each run using standard stars and the waveplate offset angles were calibrated using linear polarization standard stars .",
    "background exposures were taken at regular intervals to determine the net flux and polarization .",
    "the three @xmath0 observations during 19921993 with a mean separation of about six months , provide sufficient frequency resolution to search for fundamental periods , their harmonics and side - bands . the frequency resolution from the combined @xmath0 data is @xmath34 s@xmath35 and that from the @xmath2-@xmath3 data it is @xmath36 s@xmath35 .",
    "however , the @xmath2 data continuously span two complete binary orbits , while those of @xmath0 data have gaps due to earth occultation , saa passage and frequent switching of targets .",
    "these gaps lead to complications in the power spectrum as the true variations in the source are further modulated by the irregular sampling defined by the window function of the data .",
    "we have used four methods to search for the periodicity present in the @xmath0 data : the discrete fourier transform , the lomb - scargle periodogram ( horne & baliunas 1986 ) , the bayesian statistical approach ( rana et al .",
    "2004 ) and the one - dimensional `` clean '' algorithm ( roberts , lehar , & dreher 1987 ) as implemented in the period program ( ver .",
    "5.0 - 2 ) available in the starlink package .",
    "the bayesian approach is mathematically more rigorous and can provide optimum number of frequencies allowed by the data independent of the shape of the periodic signal . in the clean algorithm , the discrete fourier transform first calculated from the light curve is followed by the deconvolution of the `` window '' function from the data . here",
    "the power is defined as the square of the half amplitude at the specified frequency .",
    "this method has been demonstrated to work effectively for x - ray data from various satellites ( norton et al .",
    "1992a , 1992b ; rana et al .",
    "we applied the barycentric correction to all the data sets before carrying out the power spectral analysis .",
    "in addition , the data were detrended by subtracting a mean count rate prior to generating power spectra using above methods .",
    "the power spectra obtained using above mentioned methods for the combined @xmath0 data in the 0.12 kev energy band , are shown plotted in the figure [ rosatpds ] . all power spectra show four common significant peaks related to one of the fundamental period and various side bands of the two fundamental periods of the system , as marked in the figure .",
    "the two fundamental frequencies of the system are referred to as @xmath37 , corresponding to the presumed spin period and @xmath38 corresponding to the orbital period .",
    "the power spectra presented in first three panels of fig .",
    "1 show equally prominent peaks at the two fundamental periods , suggesting that a combination of orbital and spin modulations are at work in v1432  aql .",
    "however , a significant peak is seen at a frequency of 12150.72@xmath101.14  s in clean power spectrum , which is consistent with the @xmath37 that is reported by mukai et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and staubert et al .",
    "no significant power is observed at @xmath38 , which has a period of 12116.2824@xmath100.0043  s ( mukai et al .",
    "2003a ) , suggesting that the data are modulated primarily on spin period .",
    "the other dominant peaks in the power spectra correspond to the @xmath38+@xmath37 , 2@xmath38+@xmath37 , and 2@xmath38 + 2@xmath37 components .    in order to study the variations in the power density spectrum with energy",
    ", we also calculated the power spectra for the soft and medium energy bands ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "the power spectra for the soft x - ray energy band show a dominant peak at the 2@xmath38+@xmath37 component .",
    "the second dominant peak , with almost equal power to that of first one , corresponds to the 2@xmath37 component , the first harmonic of the spin period .",
    "prominent peak is also seen at @xmath39 component .",
    "the power spectra for the medium energy x - ray band show a dominant peak at the 2@xmath37-@xmath38 component .",
    "the other dominant peaks correspond to frequency components 2@xmath38 + 2@xmath37 , 2@xmath37+@xmath38 , @xmath38+@xmath37 , and @xmath37 in order of decreasing power .",
    "discrete fourier transforms are performed on the x - ray light curves with 1  s time resolution .",
    "the power spectra in the various energy bands of the @xmath2-@xmath3 data were published in paper 1 .",
    "however , the peaks in the power spectra need to be reassigned based on the spin and orbital periods being 12150.432  s and 12116.2824  s ( mukai et al .",
    "2003a ) , respectively .",
    "the power spectrum obtained from averaged mos1 and mos2 data in the energy range of 0.22 kev is shown plotted in figure  [ xmmpds ] .",
    "the energy range is chosen so that this power spectrum can be directly compared with that of @xmath0 total energy band .",
    "however , the shorter baseline gives broader peaks in the power spectrum and several frequency components are indistinguishable .",
    "for example , the two fundamental frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath38 have their power merged in to a single peak .",
    "in addition , several harmonics and side band frequencies of the fundamental periods are merged together , they are 2@xmath37 and @xmath38+@xmath37 ; 3@xmath37 , 3@xmath38 , @xmath38 + 2@xmath37 and 2@xmath38+@xmath37 ; 4@xmath37 , 4@xmath38 , @xmath38 + 3@xmath37 and 3@xmath38+@xmath37 ; and 9@xmath37 and 9@xmath38 as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the polarization data are noisier as compared to the x - ray data and suffer from poor and uneven sampling . as a result",
    "the clean procedure is not as effective here as for x - ray data , and when used to generate the power density spectrum from the polarization data , produces several strong peaks at unexplained periods .",
    "the power in the unidentified peaks dominates over peaks at true system related periods .",
    "therefore , only a discrete fourier transform is presented ( figure  [ circpds ] ) for the circular polarization data .",
    "the most dominant peak in the power spectrum corresponds to a 1 day positive alias of the 2@xmath37 component and is marked as @xmath40 .",
    "several peaks can be seen coincident with the fundamental frequency @xmath37 and its various harmonics i.e. 2@xmath37 , 3@xmath37 , 4@xmath37 and 5@xmath37 .",
    "power in the peak at the 5@xmath37 component is higher than at 3@xmath37 and 4@xmath37 .",
    "several other unidentified peaks with significant power , are also present in the power spectrum .      to study variations in the x - ray intensity of the source as a function of spin phase , we have folded the x - ray light curves on the spin period of the system . the x - ray light curves folded with the orbital period",
    "are already studied in previous publications ( see mukai et al . 2003a and paper 1 ) . when folding the x - ray data we have tried two spin ephemerides as given by mukai et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and staubert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , including the effect of @xmath41 .",
    "we find that the spin ephemeris as given by mukai et al .",
    "( 2003a ) better defines the spin minima for the x - ray data from recent years ( after 1997 ) , and that of staubert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is well suited for the data from the earlier years ( before 1997 ) . since mukai et al .",
    "( 2003a ) obtained the spin ephemeris using the optical data spanning 7 years of base line with clustering around 1998 , that could be the reason for its better fit to the spin minima for the data from the @xmath1 , @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath9 . on the other hand , staubert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have used optical and x - ray data taken during 19921997 to calculate the spin ephemeris , and that could account for a better definition of the spin minima for the @xmath0 data . with respect to a reference zero point defined using mukai s ephemeris , the spin folded features obtained using staubert s ephemeris show a varying phase shift from a negative value of -0.13 during 1992 october to a positive value of + 0.1 during 2002 july .",

    "if the two close peaks represent one dominant pole , then this implies that the pole remains in view for almost half the spin cycle , whereas the @xmath0 data show that the same pole is only visible for 0.2 of the spin phase .",
    "it is not clear why the dominant pole remains in view for a longer time during the @xmath1 and the @xmath2-@xmath3 observations .",
    "the dip at the @xmath180.35 spin phase is equally prominent in all the energy bands showing little x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , the possibility of a split or double stream system is more likely the cause for the appearance of the triple hump in the @xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath3 data , and not the absorption .",
    "the phase resolved spectroscopy presented in  5 ( fig .  [ specpara ] ) also favors this interpretation as no extra absorption is seen during this phase range .",
    "the second spot is visible during @xmath95=0.70.9 when the first goes behind the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "the location and the extent of the second hot spot in the @xmath1 and the @xmath2-@xmath3 are very similar to that in the @xmath0 data .",
    "the low intensity during @xmath95=0.60.7 and 0.901.18 is associated with a high absorption and a large covering fraction by a very thick absorber .",
    "the highest intensity peak centered at phase 0.8 has the smallest covering fraction of the source by an absorber , and gives the least hindered view toward the accreting pole .",
    "the spin folded circular polarization data support a complex magnetic field geometry with three hot spots .",
    "the two positive humps observed in the circular polarization data ( near phase 0.1 and 0.7 ) indicate the same magnetic polarity for the two emission regions and a negative polarization near phase 0.45 suggests another hot spot with opposite polarity . in this scenario ,",
    "the two humps at phase 0.25 and 0.85 in the @xmath2-@xmath3 light curve represent two hot spots with the same polarity and the third at phase 0.50 represents a region with opposite polarity .",
    "the different amplitudes of the two positive humps in the polarization suggest different magnetic field strengths for the two poles with the same polarity .",
    "the peak at phase 0.7 has relatively higher polarization , suggesting a higher magnetic field strength and hence lower accretion on that pole ( see stockman 1988 and wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) , resulting in lower x - ray emission near phase 0.85 ( a small phase shift is likely due to two different ephemerides used ) .",
    "the other pole with a relatively smaller magnetic field corresponds to higher x - ray intensity ( near phase 0.25 ) .",
    "the hot spot with opposite polarity shows a smaller circular polarization and hence corresponds to the higher x - ray intensity ( near phase 0.50 ) .",
    "the separation between the three humps in @xmath2 data suggests that the first two spots are about 90@xmath43 apart and the second and the third spots are further @xmath18126@xmath43 apart in longitude .",
    "thus , the recent x - ray and circular polarization data suggest a field geometry with at least three hot spots on the surface of the white dwarf .    a similar variation in the circular polarization data is also observed in the polar ef  eri ( piirola , reiz , & coyne 1987 ) .",
    "meggitt & wickramasinghe ( 1989 ) proposed a dominant quadrupole field structure with four active spots on the surface of the white dwarf for ef  eri using optical polarimetric data .",
    "mason et al .",
    "( 1995 ) provided evidence for the presence of multi - pole magnetic field structure in another asynchronous polar by  cam .",
    "thus , the presence of more than two accretion spots on the surface of the white dwarf is not an uncommon characteristic of polars .",
    "the difference in the morphology of x - ray light curves from the @xmath0 and @xmath2-@xmath3 ( or @xmath1 ) data can well be due to the beat period . if we choose the zero of the beat phase at the starting time of the @xmath0 1992 observation and a beat period of 49.8955 days , then the beat phases for the start time of the @xmath0 1993 march and october , optical polarization data , @xmath1 1997 october , @xmath2-@xmath3 2001 october , and @xmath9 2002 july 14 and 15 are 0.48 , 0.42 , 0.73 , 0.98 , 0.88 , 0.46 and 0.48 , respectively .",
    "if the different x - ray profiles are due to the different beat phases of the observations then the transition from the double hump to the triple hump profile most likely occurs between beat phases 0.50.7 .",
    "this conclusion is not affected even if we consider the spin up of the white dwarf in estimating the beat phases .",
    "the low and medium resolution x - ray spectra of v1432  aql obtained with the @xmath9 and the @xmath2-@xmath3 can be reproduced using either a multi - temperature plasma model with multiple absorbers or a photo - ionization model .",
    "the phase - averaged spectra from the @xmath9 extend to @xmath1830 kev and can be modeled by a simple bremsstrahlung with kt@xmath10490 kev ( 90% confidence limit ) .",
    "this temperature is among the highest seen in mcvs .",
    "the use of a multi - temperature plasma model for the @xmath9 data gives an estimated mass of the white dwarf of 1.2@xmath100.1 m@xmath11 .",
    "this is similar to that of pq  gem , a soft ip , for which james et al .",
    "( 2002 ) report a mass of @xmath105 m@xmath11 using the @xmath9 data and the same multi - temperature plasma model .",
    "the high mass estimate of the white dwarf is consistent with the idea that v1432  aql might have undergone a nova explosion in not too distant past .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed asynchronism in the system .",
    "the medium resolution @xmath2-@xmath3 spectra can be reproduced using this mass estimate in the multi - temperature plasma model .",
    "the multi - temperature plasma produced in the post - shock region must , however , be viewed through two absorbers  a thin absorber of ( 1.7@xmath100.3 ) @xmath75 @xmath52 covering the entire source and a thick absorber of ( @xmath106 ) @xmath101 @xmath52 covering 65% of the hard x - ray emission . since the plasma emission originates in the post - shock region ,",
    "these absorbers are most probably situated in front of the post - shock region or in the pre - shock flow .",
    "the abundance of fe in the plasma is found to be nearly solar ( except during the lowest intensity phase ) and provides a good fit to the emission lines at 6.7 and 7.0 kev ( see inset in fig .  [ xmmsacg ] ) .",
    "alternatively , a photo - ionization model can also reproduce the mos spectra .",
    "photo - ionization models have recently been successful in explaining the high resolution @xmath44 hetg spectra of ips , and in fact might be preferred over the multi - temperature plasma models like those used for cooling flows ( mukai et al .",
    "although the photo - ionization model has a slight edge ( in terms of @xmath54 ) over the multi - temperature plasma models used here , higher resolution grating spectra of v1432  aql are required to decide between the two models .",
    "the important differences between the two models are seen in excitation lines ( e.g. , n vi , o vii - viii , ne ix - x , mg xi - xii , si xiii - xiv , and fe l - shell emission lines ) .",
    "therefore higher resolution data are important to resolve the line emission from these elements that occur at low energies ( below @xmath182 kev ; mukai et al .",
    "however , the photo - ionization model can successfully reproduce the three fe line components at 6.4 , 6.7 , and 7.0 kev without requiring a separate gaussian component for modeling the line at 6.4 kev , as with the multi - temperature plasma model , but it requires extremely large ionic column densities for the fe ions ( see table 3 ) . the 6.7 kev and",
    "7.0 kev lines provided a reasonably good fix for the column densities of fe xxv and fe xxvi ions .",
    "the strong line emission observed at 6.4 kev can only be reproduced by having a large column for fe i  xix ions .",
    "lack of resolution in the present spectra , does not allow us to derive the individual column densities of all the ions in the photo - ionized regions .",
    "the ionic column densities derived for fe i  xix ions are tentative and likely to be overestimates .",
    "in addition , the use of the input power law continuum is not well known and the ionic column densities for fe are adjusted to fit the observed lines .",
    "the thermal plasma models ( a simple bremsstrahlung or multi - temperature plasma ) require an additional gaussian component at 6.4 kev , which is presumably due to fluorescent emission from ( cold or warm ) fe .",
    "the fit with the multi - temperature plasma model shows that the fe line at 6.4 kev has some intrinsic line width indicating the presence of warm ( partially ionized ) fe in addition to cold ( or un - ionized ) fe .",
    "alternatively , the width of 6.4 kev line can also be due to the velocity broadening but present data can not distinguish between these two mechanisms .",
    "the photo - ionized plasma model supports this trend and explicitly demonstrates the need for high column densities for fe i  xix .",
    "the variations in fe 6.4 kev line flux closely resemble the variations in the average x - ray intensity in 0.210 kev energy band , further indicating that the spin period is 12150  s.      the mass of the white dwarf can also be estimated using the intensity ratio of k@xmath14 emission lines from abundant heavy elements , as described by fujimoto & ishida ( 1997 ) . for a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) ,",
    "the intensity ratio of h to he - like k@xmath14 lines is a function of the plasma temperature ( mewe et al .",
    "the plasma temperature is directly related to the gravitational potential of the white dwarf .",
    "therefore , the mass of the white dwarf can be estimated using the mass - radius relationship ( nauenberg 1972 ) , if the plasma temperature is known . here",
    "we use only the fe k@xmath14 lines as lines from other element are not resolved .",
    "this method is independent of the uncertainties in geometrical parameters like inclination angle and the mass - radius relationship of the secondary star .",
    "the intensity ratio of h to he - like fe k@xmath14 line is @xmath180.83 for v1432  aql ( see  4.1 ) . a similar value ( @xmath180.9 ) for the line intensity ratio of fe k@xmath14 lines is reported by fujimoto ( 1996 ) for the ip , v1223  sgr .",
    "this corresponds to a lower limit of @xmath1838  kev for the shock temperature and a lower limit of 0.82m@xmath11 for the white dwarf mass in v1223  sgr .",
    "v1432  aql shows a very hard x - ray spectrum and similar line intensity ratio for the h to he - like fe k@xmath14 lines suggesting a similar lower limit for the mass of the white dwarf that is consistent with the higher mass derived from the @xmath9 spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that this method is based on the assumption that the cooling in the post - shock region is entirely due to the bremsstrahlung process and the contribution from cyclotron cooling is not significant , hence it is more suitable for ips . in the case of polars",
    ", it can only provide a lower limit to the mass of the white dwarf . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass determined using the multi - temperature plasma model is perhaps more reliable , since it takes in to account the cyclotron cooling effects ( see  4.1 ) . from the observed duration of the eclipse in v1432  aql , mukai et al .",
    "( 2003a ) estimated an upper limit of 0.67m@xmath11 for white dwarf mass .",
    "our mass estimate obtained using the x - ray continuum and the line spectroscopy methods differ significantly from mukai s estimate , and is close to that of 0.98m@xmath11 reported by ramsay ( 2000 ) using spectral fitting of the x - ray continuum .      a strong blackbody component dominates the soft x - ray energies below 0.8 kev irrespective of the models used for the higher energy spectra .",
    "this component has an average temperature between 8090 ev , which is significantly higher than what is generally observed in polars ( 2040 ev ) ( ramsay et al .",
    "2004a and references therein ) .",
    "a somewhat higher blackbody temperature in the range of 5060 ev has been reported in a few soft ips , namely , v405  aur and pq  gem by haberl & motch ( 1995 ) using @xmath0 data .",
    "recently , de martino et al . ( 2004 ) have reported the blackbody temperatures in the range of 60100 ev for three soft ips ( v405  aur , pq  gem and v2400  oph ) using broad band ( 0.190 kev ) observations with @xmath42 .",
    "a blackbody temperature of 86 ev is reported for another soft ip 1rxs j154814.5 - 452845 by haberl , motch & zickgraf ( 2002 ) .",
    "thus , v1432  aql shows a blackbody temperature similar to that observed in soft ips .",
    "high blackbody temperature indicates that the accretion is taking place over a much smaller fractional area on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "but this is a too simplistic picture , since accretion regions in polars are generally smaller than that in ips .",
    "the blackbody temperature is also high for soft ips , but they can not necessarily have smaller accretion regions than polars .",
    "the standard model for mcvs predicts a ratio of intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity to the hard component to be @xmath180.5 , including the cyclotron emission component ( lamb & masters 1979 and king & lasota 1979 ) .",
    "several polars show this ratio to be higher than that predicted by the standard model , leading to the well - known ` soft x - ray excess ' problem . on the other hand ,",
    "ips typically show a ratio in agreement with the standard model or somewhat lower than that predicted . a study of this ratio can provide valuable information about the energy balance in these systems .",
    "we have listed in table 4 the unabsorbed soft and hard x - ray fluxes and the corresponding luminosities ( assuming d=230 pc ; watson et al .",
    "1995 ) in the 0.21 kev and 110 kev energy bands , respectively .",
    "we have also calculated the unabsorbed bolometric flux and luminosity for the blackbody component and listed them in table 4 . since the blackbody component is assumed to be optically thick emission",
    ", one has to apply a geometric correction factor @xmath107 to account for projection effects , where @xmath108 is the angle between normal to the accretion region and the line of sight . for an inclination angle ( @xmath102 ) of 75@xmath109 and magnetic co - latitude ( @xmath103 ) of 15@xmath109 ( mukai et al .",
    "2003a ) , the value of @xmath108 ( = @xmath102-@xmath103 ) is 60@xmath109 , which corresponds to a correction factor of 2 .",
    "we apply this correction factor for estimating the average unabsorbed bolometric luminosity due to the blackbody ( 2.0 @xmath53 10@xmath110 ergs s@xmath35 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed hard x - ray flux in the 110 kev energy band is 2.13 @xmath53 10@xmath111 ergs @xmath52 s@xmath35 and corresponds to luminosity of 1.27 @xmath53 10@xmath112 ergs s@xmath35 .",
    "this gives a ratio of the soft to hard x - ray luminosity of @xmath180.16 , a comparatively lower value than predicted by the standard model .",
    "the photo - ionized plasma model gives a comparatively higher value for the hard x - ray luminosity and a similar value for the soft x - ray bolometric luminosity as obtained from multi - temperature plasma model , thus , further reducing the ratio for soft to hard x - ray luminosity to 0.14 .",
    "these values of ratio for soft to hard x - ray luminosity should be taken as upper limits since the contribution from cyclotron emission is not included because the cyclotron spectra were not available .",
    "ramsay et al . ( 1994 ) showed that this ratio is correlated with magnetic field strength , and a low observed value for the ratio indicates a low value for magnetic field strength . a recent study by ramsay & cropper ( 2004b )",
    "using @xmath2-@xmath3 data for a sample of polars shows no evidence of such a correlation and instead shows that @xmath1853% of all the polars studied in the sample show the ratio to be @xmath1131 .",
    "theoretical models predict that the shock height in an accretion column can be described in terms of the mass accretion rate and the fractional accreting area by the relationship @xmath114 ( frank , king & raine 1992 ) , where @xmath115 is the mass accretion rate in units of 10@xmath116 g s@xmath35 , @xmath117 is the fractional area in units of 10@xmath118 , m@xmath119 and r@xmath119 are the mass and the radius of white dwarf in solar units respectively .    the accretion rate @xmath120 can be estimated assuming that the accretion luminosity is emitted mostly in the x - rays and is given by , @xmath121 this requires an estimation for the accretion luminosity l@xmath122 and r@xmath119 .",

    "this gives a corresponding radius of the white dwarf of 3.8 @xmath125 cm ( @xmath180.005r@xmath11 ) .",

    "the above estimated values of the parameters r@xmath119 , @xmath46 , and @xmath120 enable us to calculate the value of the fractional area f as @xmath127 .",
    "finally , substituting the values of @xmath120 , @xmath83 , m@xmath119 and r@xmath119 in equation ( 1 ) , gives a value for the shock height as h=@xmath128 cm ( 0.08r@xmath119 ) .",
    "however , propagating the errors on the accretion luminosity , the total accretion rate , the mass and radius of the white dwarf provide an upper limit on shock height to be @xmath18@xmath129 cm .",
    "james et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimate an upper bound on shock height to be @xmath130 cm for the pq  gem . the higher shock height in pq  gem is due to the larger fractional accreting area ( @xmath83=@xmath131 ) , since the mass and radius of the white dwarf are about the same for both sources .",

    "the power spectrum in the 0.12 kev energy band obtained from the combined 1 year long @xmath0 observations shows a peak at the period ( @xmath37 ) of 12150.72@xmath101.14  s that is close to the value known from optical photometry and identical to the spin period of the system .",
    "a significant power is also detected in the @xmath38+@xmath37 component .",
    "2 .   the power spectrum obtained from the @xmath2-@xmath3 observation shows a dominant peak at @xmath184050  s that is likely due to the complex x - ray light curve with a triple hump profile .",
    "the strict recurrence of x - ray features at the period of 12150  s suggest that 12150  s is the likely spin period instead of 4050  s. 3 .",
    "the power spectrum from the optical circular polarization data shows prominent peaks corresponding to the first harmonic of the spin period as well as its one day alias .",
    "the fundamental period and several other harmonics are also seen .",
    "two maxima are seen in circular polarization data in each spin cycle , which explains why the first harmonic of the spin period is more prevalent than the fundamental .",
    "4 .   the spectral analysis and observed intensity of the h - like to the he - like fe k@xmath14 lines indicate a high mass for the white dwarf .",
    "variations seen in the x - ray intensity in the @xmath0 data can be explained using a two pole accretion model in which two accretion foot prints are not anti - podal .",
    "however , the triple hump profile seen in the @xmath2-@xmath3 and the @xmath1 light curves requires three hot spots on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "supportive evidence for the three spots comes from the x - ray phase resolved spectroscopy and the polarization data .",
    "the x - ray spectral study suggests the presence of a strong black body component with an average temperature of @xmath1888 ev .",
    "this is significantly higher than commonly observed in polars and is close to that observed in soft ips .",
    "the originating site for the 6.4 kev fe fluorescent line in v1432  aql most likely contains both neutral ( cold ) and partially ionized ( warm ) fe ions .",
    "velocity broadening can also be responsible for 6.4 kev line width but present data can not distinguish between the two possibilities .",
    "8 .   both the multi - temperature plasma and the photo - ionization plasma models fit the spectral data with the photo - ionization model providing a slightly better fit .",
    "the photo - ionization model , however , has several parameters that need a higher spectral resolution for their determination .",

    "<S> an analysis of stokes polarimetry data obtained from the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) is also presented . </S>",
    "<S> power spectra from long - baseline @xmath0 data show a spin period of 12150  s along with several frequency components related to the source . </S>",
    "<S> however , the second harmonic of the spin period dominates the power spectrum in the @xmath2-@xmath3 data . for the optical circular polarization </S>",
    "<S> , the dominant period corresponds to half the spin period ( or its first harmonic ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 data can be explained as due to accretion onto two hot spots that are not anti - podal . </S>",
    "<S> the variations seen in the optical polarization and the @xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath3 x - ray data suggest the presence of at least three accretion foot prints on the surface of the white dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> two spectral models , a multi - temperature plasma model and a photo - ionized plasma model , are used to understand the spectral properties of v1432  aql . </S>",
    "<S> the data from the @xmath9 proportional counter array ( pca ) with its extended high energy response are used to constrain the white dwarf mass to 1.2@xmath100.1 m@xmath11 using a multi - temperature plasma model . </S>",

    "<S> is well modeled by a blackbody component having a temperature of 8090 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma emission lines seen at 6.7 and 7.0 kev are well fitted using the multi - temperature plasma model </S>",
    "<S> . however , the fluorescent line at 6.4 kev from cold fe requires an additional gaussian component . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - temperature plasma model requires two absorbers : one that covers the source homogeneously and another partial absorber covering @xmath13% of the source . </S>",
    "<S> the photo - ionized plasma model , with a range of column densities for the fe ions , gives a slightly better overall fit and fits all emission line features . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity and spectral modulations due to the rotation of the white dwarf at a period of 12150  s require varying absorber densities and a varying covering fraction of the absorber for the multi - temperature plasma model . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a strong blackbody component , a rotation period of 12150  s , modulation of the fe fluorescence line flux with 12150  s period , and a very hard x - ray component suggest that v1432  aql is an unusual polar with x - ray spectral properties similar to that of a soft intermediate polar . </S>"
