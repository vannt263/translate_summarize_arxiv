    "transition - metal oxides of the form @xmath13o@xmath1 containing lanthanides @xmath14 and @xmath15 elements @xmath16 attract a lot of interest because of their rich variety of physical properties .",
    "this is due to strong correlation effects among the @xmath15 electrons and their hybridization with the oxygen @xmath17 orbitals , which leads to a complex interplay of different degrees of freedom like orbital , electric , magnetic , and structural features resulting in complex phase diagrams . for @xmath16=co an additional degree of freedom",
    "exists : cobalt ions exhibit the possibility of spin - state transitions leading to an even more complex behavior .",
    "a prominent example is lacoo@xmath1 , which is in the focus of research since the early 1950s.@xcite here , the co@xmath6 ions feature a @xmath18 configuration which in principle can occur in three different spin states : a low - spin ( ls ) ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , an intermediate - spin ( is ) ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , and a high - spin ( hs ) state ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "lacoo@xmath1  exhibits a non - magnetic ground state at low temperatures which is attributed to a ls state of the co@xmath6  ions .",
    "with increasing temperature a magnetic moment develops above approximately 30k whereas the insulating behavior is preserved leading to a paramagnetic semiconductor at room temperature . around 500k",
    "a metal - insulator transition is reported .",
    "the development of a magnetic moment is discussed in terms of a spin - state transition , i.e. , a temperature - driven electron transfer from the @xmath25 to the @xmath26 orbitals realizing one of the two possible higher spin states .",
    "however , the nature of the populated spin state is controversially discussed .",
    "earlier publications suggest a ls ",
    "hs transition@xcite whereas in the 1990s the possibility of a ls  is transition entered the discussion.@xcite recent spectroscopic studies turn the discussion back to a ls ",
    "hs scenario.@xcite    the physical properties of lacoo@xmath1  can be changed drastically by the heterovalent substitution of the la@xmath6 ions by divalent earth - alkaline elements like @xmath3=ca@xmath7 , sr@xmath7 , or ba@xmath7.@xcite this charge - carrier doping creates formally co@xmath27  ions : la@xmath28co@xmath29co@xmath30o@xmath31 .",
    "the co@xmath27  ions feature a @xmath32 configuration which is magnetic in all possible spin states due to the odd number of electrons : @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( ls ) , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( is ) , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( hs ) .",
    "therefore , one can expect ( i ) a change in the electrical properties due to the hole doping , ( ii ) a modification of the magnetic properties , and ( iii ) structural changes because of the different ionic radii of the substitutents as well as of the different co - oxidation states .",
    "the electric and magnetic phase diagrams of the series la@xmath0coo@xmath1  confirm the expectations ( i ) and ( ii):@xcite the heterovalent substitution of la by ca , sr , or ba suppresses the prominent maximum in @xmath39 which is caused by the aforementioned spin - state transition .",
    "the non - magnetic ground state vanishes very quickly with increasing doping concentration @xmath10 . for @xmath3=sr and ba the system runs into a spin - glass phase for intermediate @xmath10 and orders ferromagnetically at higher doping concentrations @xmath40.@xcite in some studies",
    "the ferromagnetic phase is attributed to a cluster - glass phase , but with our techniques we are not able to distinguish between them . for simplicity , we will refer to the magnetic phase as a ferromagnetic phase in the following , but one has to keep in mind that the magnetic ordering may be more complex . simultaneously with the occurrence of ferromagnetic order , the sr- and ba - doping series become metallic , too .    in a previous study we did not observe indications of a spin - glass phase in la@xmath11ca@xmath12coo@xmath1,@xcite in contrast to some other studies reporting the presence of a frustrated magnetic phase with",
    "spin - glass - like behavior.@xcite compared to the sr- and ba - doping series our magnetization data is qualitatively different in the case of @xmath3=ca . instead of a low magnetic moment",
    "@xmath41  (= magnetization at 4k ) observed for the sr- and ba - doping series , the ca - doped samples exhibit clear signatures of ferromagnetic order already for small doping concentrations with @xmath41  values of the same order of magnitude as the values found for the highly sr- and ba - doped ferromagnetic compounds .",
    "nevertheless , the saturation moment for ca doping at larger @xmath10 is somewhat smaller than for @xmath3=sr and ba .",
    "phenomenologically , the electric and magnetic properties can be understood in a double - exchange model as described in detail in ref ..",

    "for ba doping most of the available reports agree that the system finally realizes a cubic structure@xcite although there is one report of an orthorhombic description for @xmath44.@xcite however , the critical concentrations and/or critical temperatures found in the various reports are rather different . these discrepancies mainly concern high ba concentrations ( @xmath45 ) , while in the doping and temperature range of the present study ( @xmath46 ; @xmath47k ) la@xmath11ba@xmath12coo@xmath1  is found to be rhombohedral.@xcite for a =",

    "it is remarkable that nearly all samples exhibit a very small or even negative thermal expansion at low temperatures .",

    "the rapid suppression of the @xmath4 maxima agrees well with the magnetization data.@xcite however , in @xmath4 a characteristic maximum or shoulder remains observable up to @xmath65 whereas the strong increase of the magnetization prevents a detailed analysis of the spin - state transition already for @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the thermal expansion is a much more sensitive probe for detecting spin - state transitions than other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the onset of the maximum / shoulder around 25k hardly changes with increasing @xmath10 , but its shape continuously flattens .",

    "this result is consistent with the non - monotonic behavior of our magnetization data@xcite of this series .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath41  at 4k for @xmath54 ba is higher than for the samples in the intermediate doping range @xmath74 which all exhibit a spin - glass phase with an @xmath10-independent value of @xmath41 .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath75 and @xmath4 have probably the same origin : compared to sr@xmath7 and la@xmath6 , the ba@xmath7 ion is much bigger and causes therefore stronger local disorder in lacoo@xmath1  ( compare the discussion in ref . ) .",
    "obviously this leads to a more efficient suppression of the spin - state transition which is responsible for the exponential drop of @xmath4 upon cooling . for @xmath76 only very broad shoulders of @xmath4 are present .",
    "thus , all curves of this ba - doping range resemble @xmath4 of the @xmath65 sr - doped crystal .",

    "the above observations indicate that the compounds do not exhibit a simple ferromagnetic order in the entire concentration range .",
    "as suggested earlier,@xcite the glass - like freezing of the magnetic moments for @xmath84 is most likely caused by a competition of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , which can prevent a spontaneous symmetry breaking at a well - defined temperature .",
    "hence , the entropy continuously decreases upon cooling .",
    "the existence of such a frustrated spin - glass phase may also affect the ferromagnetic order ( or cluster - glass phase ) present for larger @xmath10 .",

    "there is a combination of a rotation around a cubic [ 001 ] direction and a tilting around a cubic [ 110 ] direction , see the discussion in ref .. the orthorhombic symmetry allows larger rotation and tilt distortions and apparently it may more easily accommodate internal disorder . due to the occurrence of the structural phase transition@xcite and the possible existence of an additional phase boundary ( this work )",

    "since the htm is observed around 270k for @xmath99 and seems to shift slightly above room temperature for @xmath94 , it appears natural that this minimum in @xmath4 signals the structural transition .",

    "a homogeneous transition one would thus expect a positive peak in the thermal expansion coefficient at the r@xmath42c  pbnm transition , whereas the high - resolution dilatometer data clearly show a negative peak .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is related to the fact that the average volume is nearly constant and is caused most likely by an anomalous expansion of the minority phase .",

    "since the ferromagnetic single crystals of the sr series show more pronounced anomalies of @xmath81  at @xmath69 , see fig.[lscolbcocp ] , one may suspect that this is related to the polycrystalline nature of the la@xmath11ca@xmath12coo@xmath1  samples .",
    "however , the @xmath69  anomaly of the polycrystal la@xmath120ba@xmath121coo@xmath8 is as large as the one of the corresponding sr - doped single crystal and much larger than those of the la@xmath11ca@xmath12coo@xmath1  samples .",
    "this can be seen as a further indication that the nature of the magnetic ordering in the _ entire _ series la@xmath11ca@xmath12coo@xmath1  is more complex , as has been suggested in refs . and , too .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table[caalphacpanos ] , we summarize the temperatures of all anomalies observed in the thermal - expansion ( @xmath107 , @xmath103 , and @xmath108 ) , specific - heat ( @xmath111  and @xmath112 ) , magnetization ( @xmath69 ) , and x - ray diffraction data ( @xmath122  and @xmath114 ) of la@xmath11ca@xmath12coo@xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic temperatures to be compared with each other are : @xmath107  with @xmath111 , @xmath103  with @xmath112  and with @xmath114 , and @xmath108  with @xmath69 .",
    "plotting them all together yields the phase diagram in fig.[lccophasediagramschematic ] .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we only show the data points determined from measurements upon increasing temperature . for the first - order structural phase transition , the corresponding phase boundary obtained on cooling is shifted to lower temperature .",
    "both phase boundaries lie in the  crossover  region shown in the structural phase diagram of ref ..    ca@xmath12coo@xmath1  based on the transition temperatures given in table[caalphacpanos ] obtained by magnetization ( ref . ) , thermal - expansion , specific - heat , and x - ray diffraction measurements ( this work ) .",
    "pm denotes the paramagnetic and fm the ( quasi-)ferromagnetic phase , respectively .",
    "the transition from an insulator to a  metal  takes place only gradual in this series ; compare ref .. the lines are guides to the eyes .",
    "please note , that the structural transition is of first order .",
    "the phase boundary shown here is based on the measurements upon warming .",
    "the respective phase boundary obtained on cooling lies lower in temperature .",
    "moreover , there is a rather large region of coexisting r@xmath42c and pbnm phases ( see text).,width=321 ]    \\(i ) the magnetic phase boundary has been already reported in ref .. the magnetic phase transition is seen in the entire doping region above @xmath123 with @xmath69  values saturating slightly above 150k for high ca concentrations . the onset of magnetic order is also reflected in @xmath4 ( at @xmath108 ) and in @xmath124 ( at @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is , however , difficult to discern a clear separation between metallic and insulating phases , the metal - insulator transition in la@xmath11ca@xmath12coo@xmath1  is only gradual as indicated on top of the phase diagram ( fig.[lccophasediagramschematic ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) together with the information obtained by x - ray diffraction experiments another anomaly in @xmath4 ( at @xmath103 ) and in @xmath124 ( at @xmath112 ) is identified as a first - order structural phase transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral symmetry .",
    "for @xmath125 the corresponding transition temperature linearly increases with increasing @xmath10 as shown by the solid line in fig.[lccophasediagramschematic ] .",
    "note , however , that the first - order structural transition in this cross - over range is not complete .",
    "minority phases remain visible far above and below the transition , in agreement with ref .. at higher temperatures , the slope of the structural phase boundary reduces above @xmath126.@xcite a linear extrapolation to lower @xmath10 would end at @xmath127 for @xmath128",
    ". however , the @xmath4 measurements for the samples with @xmath57 and @xmath65 do not show any indications of the htm , which signals the structural phase transition .",
    "thus , we conclude that the slope of this phase boundary increases and hence the phase transition vanishes in the doping region @xmath129 as denoted by the dotted line in fig.[lccophasediagramschematic ] . as mentioned above the @xmath4 curves of the samples with @xmath130 signal that in this doping range yet a sizeable fraction of the co@xmath6  ions undergoes the temperature - dependent spin - state transition .",
    "thus , one may speculate that the spin - state transition , which causes an anomalous expansion of a certain fraction of co@xmath6  ions , affects the structural degree of freedom",
    ". however , a study of the related la@xmath11eu@xmath12coo@xmath1  series@xcite revealed that the doping - induced structural phase transition from rhombohedral to orthorhombic symmetry and the spin - state transition do not exclude each other .",
    "\\(iii ) the clear ltm in @xmath4 at @xmath131 and the rather small anomaly in @xmath124 at @xmath132 are not visible below @xmath65 , either , and they disappear for @xmath133 , too .",
    "the origin of this third anomaly remains unclear , although it seems that both anomalies , htm and ltm , start at a similar doping concentration @xmath134 .",
    "as already mentioned this coincides with the ca concentration at which the signature of a temperature - driven spin - state transition of the co@xmath6  ions has completely vanished .",
    "please note that the thermal - expansion coefficient is a highly sensitive probe for this phenomenon.@xcite both anomalies , ltm and htm , are of similar size in @xmath4 .",
    "hence , it is quite surprising that there are only very tiny effects ( weak slope changes ) in @xmath124 at @xmath132 suggesting that this might not be a ",
    "real  phase transition in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "therefore , the line corresponding to the @xmath131 in fig.[lccophasediagramschematic ] is dotted .",
    "in summary , we present a detailed comparative study of the thermal expansion and the specific heat of la@xmath0coo@xmath1  with @xmath3=ca , sr , and ba . the sr- and ba - doped series exhibit a doping - induced electrical as well as a doping- and temperature - driven magnetic transition .",
    "our data confirm the formerly presented phase diagrams based on magnetization and resistivity measurements .",
    "especially the onset of long - range ferromagnetic order is clearly detected in @xmath124 .    for la@xmath11ca@xmath12coo@xmath1",
    "we find up to three different anomalies ( kink , ltm , and htm in @xmath4 ) depending on temperature and ca concentration .",
    "based on these data we propose an extended phase diagram for la@xmath11ca@xmath12coo@xmath1 .",
    "the comparison to the magnetization data allows to attribute the kink in @xmath4 and a much less pronounced anomaly in @xmath124 to the magnetic transition . by correlating the dilatometry and x - ray data ,",
    "we conclude that the htm in @xmath4 arise from a first - order structural phase transition from a rhombohedral r@xmath42c at low  @xmath10/low  @xmath70 towards an orthorhombic pbnm symmetry at higher  @xmath10/higher  @xmath70 .",
    "this structural transition , however , remains incomplete resulting in phase coexistance .",
    "the third anomaly , the ltm in @xmath4 , is clearly visible in @xmath4 but surprisingly hardly affects the specific heat .",
    "its origin remains to be clarified yet .    finally , we comment on the question whether there are temperature - driven spin - state transitions of the co@xmath6  and co@xmath27  ions in la@xmath0coo@xmath1 . since the spin - state transition can be monitored in @xmath4 in detail ,",
    "our data clearly show , that the spin - state transition observed in lacoo@xmath1  is rapidly suppressed with increasing @xmath10 . above @xmath135 any indication of a temperature - driven _ change _ of the spin states has completely vanished for all three doping series la@xmath0coo@xmath1 . from the thermal expansion data it is , however , not possible to deduce _ which _ particular spin states are realized in the co@xmath6  and co@xmath27  ions , but our magnetization@xcite and transport@xcite data suggest that , at least for larger @xmath10 , the co@xmath27  ions are present in the ls and the co@xmath6  ions in the is state .",
