    "the far ultraviolet continuum from ic 63 will be discussed in a separate work ( gordon & hurwitz , in prep ) . here",
    "we focus our attention on the  fluorescence .    apart from the region longward of 1170  , where the data reveal emission features that we have not been able to identify , the general appearance of the model fluorescent spectrum is in good agreement with our observational data in the 1000  1200   region .",
    "the absolute scaling of the fluorescence , however , differs significantly from the values found previously .",
    "witt et al . measured a flux of about @xmath24 ergs @xmath14 s@xmath15 sr@xmath15 between 1350 and 1650  .",
    "adopting the line strengths from sternberg , we find that the iue band encompasses 26% of the radiated uv power , leading to a total uv flux of about @xmath25 ergs @xmath14 s@xmath15 sr@xmath15 , or equivalently , an  scale factor of 26 .",
    "this is an observational limit based on what we will refer to as the iue - band flux , and includes the effects of reddening . for comparison with our dereddened constraints shown in figure 1",
    ", we must remember to deredden the iue band as well , leading to an  scale factor of about 31 ( if e@xmath21 = 0.03 ) in the iue band .",
    "we find a best fit  scale factor of about 3.3 in the orfeus band , and a 95% confidence range from 2.2 to 3.9 .",
    "our measurements fall an order of magnitude or more below the iue - band results .",
    "interestingly , there was some evidence for a shortfall in the measured flux compared to the fluorescence model within the iue spectrum . in figure 2 of it",
    "can be seen that the data are below the model at wavelengths below about 1300  .",
    "the general iue flux level at @xmath26 1200    would produce about 0.0025 ph @xmath14 s@xmath15 @xmath15 in the orfeus aperture , in good agreement with our own measurements .",
    "the faintness of the short wavelength iue data has engendered little previous commentary , perhaps because of the perception that correction for lyman @xmath7 emission and/or stray starlight introduced too much uncertainty at the shortest iue wavelengths .",
    "most of the iue spectrum is dominated by lyman band transitions to high vibrational states .",
    "the orfeus spectrum includes both lyman and werner features ; the latter generally form the most prominent complexes .",
    "we have fit the orfeus spectrum with varying ratios of lyman and werner band line fluxes , but the goodness of fit does not improve measurably .",
    "gross distortions ( e.g. complete exclusion of the werner band ) fit the data very poorly , and even at this extremum the orfeus spectrum requires an  scale factor no greater than 6 .",
    "the iue aperture ( 10 @xmath16 20 @xmath9 ) was somewhat smaller than that used with orfeus .",
    "since neither instrument provides useful spatial information within the field of view , both might underestimate the true specific intensity if the fluorescence region is very centrally concentrated .",
    "our larger aperture makes us more susceptible to dilution effects , which could introduce a factor of up to 2.6 in the comparison of our results with those of iue .",
    "we note however that other tracers of central concentration in ic 63 would not predict a strong fall - off in the fluorescent intensity until significantly larger angular scales are reached (; ) .",
    "if the general ir - to - uv ratio is comparable to that predicted by sternberg , the measurements of suggest that the dilution within their 74@xmath9 beam was no worse than a factor of @xmath264 , e.g. that the fluorescent region is unlikely to be much smaller than 30 or 40@xmath9 in diameter .",
    "an increase in the dust extinction to which the fluorescent spectrum is subjected could preferentially attenuate the shorter wavelengths , helping to reconcile our results with those of .",
    "complete reconciliation of the orfeus and iue - band by this effect would require roughly 1.5 magnitudes of visual extinction .",
    "given the low extinction toward @xmath4 cas , general interstellar dust is unlikely to be responsible .",
    "the nebula itself contains an ample supply of dust ; significant differential extinction could arise if the fluorescence region is hidden behind gas that is presumably in atomic form .",
    "there are two difficulties with this scenario .",
    "the absorbing slab would increase the unreddened  scale factor to about 130 , requiring an incident radiation field well in excess of that from @xmath4 cas",
    ". furthermore the infrared fluorescent line intensities ( which are far less affected by extinction ) would be much brighter than those observed @xcite .",
    "the  emission spectrum from 1140 to 1680    excited by 100 ev electron impact has recently been published @xcite .",
    "j. ajello kindly provided these data , and the spectrum from 1200 to 1720   produced by 16 ev electrons , in electronic format .",
    "the higher energy electron impact spectrum shares some overlap with the orfeus spectral band , but the observational data do not enable us to distinguish this process from ordinary photon fluorescence .",
    "the `` hardness ratio , '' here defined as the 1220  1300 flux divided by the flux longward of 1400  , is comparable for the photon fluorescence spectrum and the 16 ev electron impact spectrum .",
    "the 100 ev spectrum is about 50% harder .",
    "the electron excitation mechanism thus does not appear to offer a great advantage in reconciling the orfeus spectrum with that of iue .",
    "extension of the electron impact spectra to shorter wavelengths ( and probably to lower electron energies ) would nonetheless be of utility .",
    "the potential for absorption from quiescent  seems plausible in this environment , but its signature ( a series of bands at wavelengths below 1108  ) is not evident in the spectrum .",
    "all of the fluorescent features in the orfeus band , not merely those below 1108 , are weak compared to the iue lines .    predicted that the fluorescent emission at shorter wavelengths would be fainter than the model predictions , invoking optical depth effects within the fluorescent zone itself .",
    "the model of sternberg includes the effect of dust and gas on the incident radiation field , and properly treats dust extinction as the fluorescent photons exit the cloud .",
    "it is `` optically thin , '' however , in that the outgoing radiation is not subjected to absorption from the rovibrationally excited , a process that becomes increasingly important at shorter wavelengths .",
    "even if the interaction is primarily a resonant scattering , photon trapping will burden the shorter wavelength photons with a longer effective path length and therefore a higher effective extinction before they can escape .",
    "this mechanism should convert a fraction of the stellar radiation field into an `` excess '' of infrared emission ( compared to models where the effect is not included ) .",
    "the observed infrared emission from ic 63 exceeds the total incident stellar power @xcite , so we can say only that the data do not rule out the possibility of this reprocessing effect .",
    "we have detected  fluorescence at wavelengths between 1000 and 1200   from the bright reflection nebula ic 63 with the berkeley spectrograph aboard the -ii mission @xcite .",
    "the wavelengths and relative strengths of the fluorescent features within the orfeus band agree well with the predictions of the model of .",
    "the absolute fluorescent intensity is fainter than an extrapolation from observations at longer ultraviolet wavelengths @xcite by a factor of ten .",
    "the measurements can not be reconciled by differential extinction from a foreground slab of dust ( presumably associated with neutral gas ) nor by absorption from quiescent .",
    "optical depth effects in the fluorescing  itself , predicted by , remain the most plausible mechanism to explain our observations ."
