    "it is well known that the control of absorption and emission properties of atoms may be achieved by controlling the nature of atomic coherence .",
    "driving field strengths and detunings provide the necessary tuning parameters to achieve this control .",
    "multi - level atoms have the advantage of providing a larger set of tuning parameters .",
    "three level atoms show a class of phenomena which are absorption inhibitive @xcite while four - level systems have shown absorption inducive features at three photon resonance @xcite .",
    "the narrow absorption features which have been seen in four level systems is attributed to the interaction of double dark resonances @xcite .",
    "scully et al @xcite report the occurrence of doppler - free absorption , which has also been reported earlier @xcite .",
    "other features which have been reported in four - level systems include coherence switching @xcite , photon switching ( two - photon absorption ) @xcite , fast switching of nonlinear absorption @xcite , enhancement and suppression of two photon absorption @xcite and the occurrence of three peaked absorption @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the absorption properties and the modification of the ground state absorption due to the additional upper transition couplings . in section",
    "ii the details of the model is described and the equation of motion is set up .",
    "previous studies @xcite have revealed that the dynamics of four - level atoms interacting with three driving fields may be classified into two broad domains , i ) the weak middle transition coupling and ii ) the strong middle transition coupling . hence , the analysis is presented separately for these two cases in sections iii and iv respectively . in both",
    "the cases analytical results are derived perturbatively and the qualitative features are compared with exact numerical calculations which are illustrated graphically .",
    "the model we consider consists of a four - level ladder system shown in fig 1 .",
    "the only dipole allowed transitions are @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 coupled respectively by the rabi frequencies @xmath6 and the bohr frequencies are denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the decay constants corresponding to the respective levels are denoted by @xmath8 , i=1,4 .",
    "the frequency of the applied fields are denoted by @xmath9 and the detunings are denoted by @xmath10 corresponding to the three couplings .",
    "the analysis presented here can also in principle be valid to any other type of 4-level system with transitions such that not more than two dipole transitions share a single level .",
    "this could include n type systems as well as the mirror reflected n type systems .",
    "this particular ladder system may be identified , for example with the rb hyper fine levels .",
    "for instance , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 could correspond to the three levels with an additional hyperfine level corresponding to either @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath12 .",
    "in fact the decay parameters of the model have been chosen to be the same as the decay constants of these levels , @xmath15 and @xmath16 in terms of the ground state life time @xmath17 which is chosen to be one for convenience .     .",
    "@xmath18 are the decay constants of the corresponding levels . ]    the density matrix equations ( @xcite ) are written in the rotating wave approximation as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are the decay constants of the levels i and @xmath21 are the laser detunings ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 we study the steady state behaviour of the system for various values of the driving field strengths and detunings . in the general situation",
    ", we present the numerical solutions to the populations and coherences where the driving field strengths are treated up to all orders .",
    "the modification of the absorption profile of the ground state as well as the upper levels will be studied analytically by perturbatively solving for the density matrix elements in @xmath24 or @xmath25 as the case may be .",
    "in the case when the transition @xmath26 is weakly coupled , i.e. when @xmath24 is very small compared to @xmath27 , the equation of motion for the density matrix elements can be solved perturbatively in @xmath24 .",
    "the set of fifteen coupled equations decouples into three subsystems of equations which are solved independently to obtain analytical solutions .",
    "in fact , the density matrix elements given by the sets @xmath28@xmath29 and @xmath30 form three subsystems . the zeroth and first order solutions for @xmath31 remain zero , while the coherences @xmath32 are nonzero in the first order and are listed in the appendix .",

    "we have relabeled @xmath37 everywhere by @xmath38 .",
    "the second order steady state solutions for the set of coherences @xmath39 are the same as the first order solutions given in the appendix .",
    "note that , in the limit @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the solution for @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by the zeroth order solutions which is the usual absorption and population of two - level system driven by a field of strength @xmath25 .",
    "there is very little modification in @xmath42 and @xmath43 due to the first order contribution .",
    "however the inclusion of the second order contribution introduces additional terms . before investigating this further ,",
    "let us look at the graphical illustration of the ground state absorption as a function of detuning which has been solved numerically for all orders in the driving field strengths . in fig 2",
    "the curve corresponding to ( a ) shows the absorption in the presence of only @xmath44 coupling , ( b ) corresponds to the absorption of the ground state ( g.s . ) in the presence of the @xmath44 as well as the @xmath45 couplings and ( c ) shows the modification of the g.s .",

    "it is obvious from these expressions that there is a resonance at @xmath53 .",
    "the populations @xmath69 and @xmath70 show a sharp rise as @xmath71 since the numerator is positive .",
    "thus to populate the levels 3 and 4 maximally when the middle level coupling is weak , it is sufficient to match the requirement @xmath53 .",
    "the absorption profile @xmath72 also shows a similar trend .",
    "while the second term in @xmath73 and @xmath74 are negative and the role of the resonance in the denominator is to introduce a minima when @xmath53 .",
    "thus the role of the second order term in this case , is to introduce a dip in the line center in an otherwise two - level absorption profile and hence a depletion in the population of level 2 .",
    "as one increases @xmath24 this perturbative expansion is no longer valid .",
    "moreover , the numerical calculations upto all orders in @xmath24 reveal the fact that the resonance condition becomes weaker and the sharp features vanish .",
    "this is demonstrated graphically in fig6 - 8 .",
    "thus , in a four - level system with middle transition coupling very weak , the condition for maximally populating the upper levels is to satisfy this resonance condition .",
    "the population transfer to higher levels occurs at the cost of depletion of population in the second level .",
    "this modification is mediated by the contribution of the coherences , which at three photon resonance are given by @xmath75 where @xmath76",
    "i next consider the case when the @xmath77 transition is strongly coupled i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "treating @xmath25 perturbatively , the first order absorption of the ground state takes the simple form @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we now look at some simple situations , for example when @xmath82 , the absorption becomes proportional to @xmath83 which is the ground state absorption for a weak excitation and observe that the width is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "next , consider only @xmath41 . the absorption is now given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is assumed to be zero .",
    "the denominator is quadratic in @xmath87 and hence has two peaks corresponding to the usual autler - townes doublet .",
    "the width of this eit window is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "the absorption for @xmath66 ( at the line center ) is proportional to @xmath89 which is negligible since it is of the order @xmath90 .",
    "the absorption in the presence of the third driving field for @xmath91 takes the simplified form @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the denominator is a cubic equation in @xmath87 with the three roots corresponding to the three absorption peaks , two of them correspond to the usual autler -townes doublet and the absorption at the line center is due to the three photon interaction and is proportional to @xmath96 which occurs when all the detunings are zero .",
    "this three peaked absorption in four level systems has been observed earlier and has been frequently referred to as the splitting of the eit window . while the role of the strong @xmath26 coupling was to introduce transparency at the line center , the role of the @xmath46 coupling is to induce a narrow absorption at the line center within the eit window .",
    "thus the two photon absorption was responsible for the coherence @xmath97 which in turn lead to non - absorption while , the three photon absorption which introduced a coherence between levels 1 and 4 ( @xmath98 ) which in turn induced this sharp absorption feature .",
    "thus there is a contrast in the nature of the quantum interference in the case of two and three photon interaction .    on the other hand",
    "consider the case when the detuning @xmath99 is nonzero .",
    "let @xmath100 , the absorption now reduces to @xmath101 this is a lorentzian with width proportional to @xmath102 .",
    "this implies that the line width can be subnatural ( @xmath103 ) for @xmath104 .",
    "notice the novel feature here which is the absence of the autler - townes doublet unlike the case when only @xmath47 was nonzero .",
    "thus , we now have obtained a powerful technique for filtering the autler - townes doublet and retaining only the narrow absorption at the line center in addition to gaining control over the linewidth .",
    "this could prove to be a useful technique in high resolution spectroscopy .    a numerical illustration of these novel features is presented in fig 9 where the steady state solutions are obtained for all orders in the driving field strengths .     and ( b ) @xmath105 .a)@xmath106 with @xmath47 b)@xmath106 with @xmath107.c)@xmath108 with @xmath47 d)@xmath108 with @xmath107 e)@xmath109 with @xmath47 f)@xmath109 with @xmath107 with the @xmath110 the same as in the previous figures.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and ( b ) @xmath105 .a)@xmath106 with @xmath47 b)@xmath106 with @xmath107.c)@xmath108 with @xmath47 d)@xmath108 with @xmath107 e)@xmath109 with @xmath47 f)@xmath109 with @xmath107 with the @xmath110 the same as in the previous figures.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   and ( b ) @xmath105 .a)@xmath106 with @xmath47 b)@xmath106 with @xmath107.c)@xmath108 with @xmath47 d)@xmath108 with @xmath107 e)@xmath109 with @xmath47 f)@xmath109 with @xmath107 with the @xmath110 the same as in the previous figures.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and ( b ) @xmath105 .a)@xmath106 with @xmath47 b)@xmath106 with @xmath107.c)@xmath108 with @xmath47 d)@xmath108 with @xmath107 e)@xmath109 with @xmath47 f)@xmath109 with @xmath107 with the @xmath110 the same as in the previous figures.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   and ( b ) @xmath105 .a)@xmath106 with @xmath47 b)@xmath106 with @xmath107.c)@xmath108 with @xmath47 d)@xmath108 with @xmath107 e)@xmath109 with @xmath47 f)@xmath109 with @xmath107 with the @xmath110 the same as in the previous figures.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and ( b ) @xmath105 .a)@xmath106 with @xmath47 b)@xmath106 with @xmath107.c)@xmath108 with @xmath47 d)@xmath108 with @xmath107 e)@xmath109 with @xmath47 f)@xmath109 with @xmath107 with the @xmath110 the same as in the previous figures.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    figure 9 clearly shows the difference in the behaviour depending on the strength of the middle transition coupling .",

    "again , @xmath111 for small @xmath24 is very strong ( fig9c - a ) as the perturbation calculation indicate ( section iii ) and this absorption is not very significant for large @xmath24 since the resonance condition weakens and the contribution of higher order terms in @xmath24 dominate .",
