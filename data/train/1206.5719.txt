    "this paper addresses questions about the nature of dynamical phase transitions and crossovers in open quantum systems from the perspective of observers able to make measurements on the environment .",
    "we take our motivation from experiments using homodyne detection schemes  @xcite and study the time series or trajectories of quadratures of the light emitted from open quantum systems .",
    "we go beyond recent work  @xcite which focused on trajectories of quantum jumps analyzed from the point of view of the counting statistics of , for example , photons entering the environment . in this approach , identifying the average rate of photon emission as a dynamical order parameter allowed to uncover dynamical phase transitions and crossovers in a number of systems  @xcite .",
    "a central idea in the works upon which we build was the introduction of a field conjugate to the number of emitted quanta , the so - called `` @xmath0-field '' .",
    "in equilibrium statistical mechanics , the observation of phase transitions is dependent on choice of the external field used to tune across a transition and the use of an appropriate order parameter ; in this work we demonstrate that different _ dynamical _ order parameters and conjugate @xmath0-fields allow exploration of different _ dynamical _ phase transitions . specifically we show that crossovers between dynamical phases may be observed from quadrature measurements which could not be found by counting photons , and vice versa .",
    "we also extend our study to consider the effects of two @xmath0-fields , so that we can influence both light quadratures and quantum jumps .",
    "this enables us to understand the relation between inferences from different dynamical observables ; for example , we can find the typical quadrature measurements which would be made in rare quantum - jump trajectories , when either fewer or more photons are emitted than average .",
    "our approach takes as a starting point the basic observation that ( real - time ) dynamics is more than statics .",
    "sometimes dynamical behaviour , including transitions and crossovers between different dynamical regimes , can be understood from the properties of the stationary state . but",
    "a more common occurrence is that dynamical fluctuations are only revealed via ( often high - order ) time - correlation functions , and not by static or one - time observables .",
    "this suggests that for a proper statistical analysis of the dynamics of open systems a ` statistical mechanics of trajectories ' is needed .",
    "such an approach is the so - called @xmath0-ensemble method , which has proven useful for the study of classical many - body systems displaying complex cooperative dynamics such as glasses @xcite .",
    "the aim is to describe dynamical phases in terms of strictly dynamical order parameters and to classify these dynamical phases and the changes between them using a mathematical and conceptual framework analogous to that of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "this ensemble method for dynamics can therefore be thought of as a ` thermodynamics of trajectories ' approach @xcite .",
    "dynamical phase transitions are not limited to classical systems ; transitions and crossovers have been discovered in a number of driven open quantum systems .",
    "famous examples include the laser  @xcite , whose behaviour close to threshold resembles a closed thermodynamic system in the neighbourhood of a continuous phase transition , and the micromaser  @xcite , where a flux of atoms is coupled to an optical cavity mode and drives the cavity through a series of crossovers .",
    "however more recently , dynamical phase transitions have also been discovered in a broad range of fields , spanning decohering spin channels  @xcite , information transport in complex systems  @xcite , current fluctuations in isolated diffusive systems  @xcite and even the decoherence of tunnelling molecules  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ensemble method was recently applied to the study of ensembles of quantum - jump trajectories in open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "although similar in spirit to ideas in full counting statistics  @xcite , the @xmath0-ensemble approaches the problem from a different perspective and has now been developed for a variety of problems where dynamical phases are classified according to the counting statistics of quantum jumps @xcite .    , where the operators @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators of an harmonic oscillator bath and the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 are system operators which are related to the lindblad projectors of the system .",
    "]    in this paper , we formulate the application of the @xmath0-ensemble to light quadratures by means of reduced characteristic operators .",
    "measuring quadratures of emitted light allows the quantum state of light emitted from an open system to be probed in a way not possible by counting photons .",
    "for example , it provides an understanding of whether the light is in a coherent state , a squeezed state or another more exotic state .",
    "we apply this method to a selection of open quantum systems , ranging from few - level quantum - optical systems to the micromaser , all of which have a stucture illustrated schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : gen ] .",
    "in contrast to counting the number of emitted photons , as in studies of quantum - jump trajectories , we consider the temporal accumulation of quadratures of light emitted from a system into its environment .",
    "we consider this a _",
    "quadrature trajectory_. unlike the quantum - jump trajectories , the accumlation of light quadratures in the environment is a diffusive process .",
    "however we can define a _ quadrature activity _ , defined as a time - averaged light quadrature , and use this as a dynamical order parameter to characterise dynamical phases in the space of quadrature trajectories .",
    "our motivation for studying the statistics of quadratures is inspired by the experimental technique of homodyne detection .",
    "the @xmath5-quadrature trajectories of emitted light are directly related to the _ homodyne current _",
    "@xcite , as described in fig .",

    "( it is also sensible for us to study other quadratures , since these are accessible via a change in the driving hamiltonian , which we will discuss later in sec .",
    "[ sec : level2 ] . )",
    "the statistics of quadrature trajectories provide a more natural probe of the system dynamics than quantum - jump trajectories and we will show that such measurement schemes allow exploration of dynamical phases in a variety of systems .",
    "@xmath6{homodyne.eps } \\includegraphics[scale=0.125]{rand1.eps } \\end{array}$ ]    beyond examining dynamical phases identified by quadrature activity , we construct marginal probability distributions for general quadrature operators at all angles in phase space . using these marginals",
    ", we reconstruct wigner distributions  @xcite via the inverse radon transform , to find the state of the emitted light .",
    "we extend our studies to examine the typical quadrature trajectories of systems biased by the number of photon emissions .",
    "this allows us to understand the nature of light emitted from a system for all quantum - jump trajectories , whether _ rare _ or _ typical _ with respect to the number of emitted photons .",
    "more generally we study the trajectories of a particular observable after having biased the system towards rare trajectories of another ( generally non - commuting ) observable .",
    "this technique also allows us to identify the appropriate dynamical order parameters to understand the dynamical phases in different open systems .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the following section we introduce the formalism of the @xmath0-ensemble and describe the it calculus methods which we employ for the stochastic description of the environment we use in this paper .",
    "we further develop generalised master equations for the dynamics of quadrature - biased systems and systems biased towards rare trajectories of both quantum - jumps and quadratures .",

    "[ sec : conc ] we give our conclusions .",
    "several recent studies have applied the @xmath0-ensemble method to study the statistics of quantum trajectories in open quantum systems using a thermodynamic description  @xcite . in this section",
    "we will give an account of the @xmath0-ensemble formalism for quantum trajectories .",
    "we discuss the specific examples of counting photons and measuring the quadratures of light entering the environment around an open quantum system .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : sensemble ] we discuss the general application of the @xmath0-ensemble in the study of the statistics of an observable @xmath7 .",
    "we then reformulate these principles so their application to open systems is clear .",
    "section  [ sec : inout ] discusses the open quantum system methods which we use , which are applied to the @xmath0-ensemble in sections  [ sec : s1 ] and  [ sec : s2 ] .",
    "we begin by considering a particular measurable quantity @xmath7 associated with a quantum trajectory of a quantum system coupled to a reservoir .",
    "( for example , @xmath7 could be the number of emitted photons in a time @xmath8 , or other quantities which we define below . )",
    "projecting the system density matrix @xmath9 on to the subspace where @xmath7 takes a particular value , one may define a reduced density matrix @xmath10 .",
    "the probability of such a realisation occuring in time @xmath8 is then given by @xmath11 $ ] and , after long times when the system reaches a steady state , this takes a large - deviation ( ld ) form :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 contains all the information about the probability distribution of @xmath7 at long times .",
    "alternatively the statistics may be described introducing a moment generating function associated with these probabilities .",
    "this method proceeds by introducing another density matrix @xmath14 defined by the laplace transform    @xmath15    from which we define the moment generating function @xmath16 in both   and  , the integrals should be replaced with sums if @xmath7 is a discrete quantity , as is the case when counting photons .",
    "a ld form @xmath17 is found at long times , with ld functions @xmath18 and @xmath13 related by legendre transform , @xmath19 .",
    "the full statistics of @xmath7 are therefore contained within @xmath18 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath20 describes , when @xmath21 , rare trajectories where @xmath7 is far from the mean . in counting processes , where @xmath7 is bounded from below by zero",
    ", the rare trajectories can be separated into _ more active _ trajectories when @xmath22 and _ less active _ trajectories when @xmath23 .",
    "these correspond respectively to trajectories with a larger or a smaller number of counts than in the @xmath24 physical dynamics .",
    "there are two immediate advantages to this @xmath0-ensemble approach .",
    "firstly , as the ld function @xmath18 is the largest real eigenvalue of a superoperator which generates the @xmath0-biased dynamics of @xmath20 ( which we derive in the following sections ) , evaluation of the statistics of trajectories can be straightforward . of particular interest",
    "are the first and second moments , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which may be found directly from the ld function via @xmath27 where the @xmath0 subscripts indicated that the expectation values are taken with respect to the ensemble of trajectories biased by @xmath28 .",
    "secondly , this method provides a thermodynamic formalism for non - equilibrium processes .",
    "the ld functions @xmath18 and @xmath13 are analogues of free energy and entropy densities , with @xmath0 the conjugate _ intensive _ field to the _ time - extensive _ @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the so - called activity @xmath25 may be used as a dynamical order parameter to distinguish dynamical phases , whose boundaries may be crossed by tuning the parameter @xmath0 , or other system parameters . indeed , such phase boundaries are crossed when an @xmath0-derivative of @xmath18 becomes discontinuous .",
    "so far , the @xmath0-ensemble studies of open quantum systems have explored the thermodynamics of quantum - jump trajectories associated with counting quanta emitted from a system into a markovian environment . in these cases",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is , for example , the number of photons emitted ( _ i.e. _ the number of quantum jumps ) , @xmath29 , from a system in unit time . defining reservoir ladder operators @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath1 in the heisenberg representation , the quantity @xmath29 corresponds integrating over time the observable @xmath30 .",
    "biasing these trajectories , we obtain a ld function @xmath31 from which we extract the dynamical order parameter @xmath32 .    in this paper , we develop the @xmath0-ensemble further to study the statistics of the quadratures of light entering a markovian bath from various quantum systems . choosing @xmath7 to be the @xmath5- and @xmath33-quadratures of the light , corresponding to bath operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we will use corresponding _ quadrature activities _ @xmath36 and @xmath37 when applying @xmath0-fields to bias the dynamics towards rare quadrature trajectories . in much the same way as the photon activity @xmath38 can be associated with the average number of photons emitted in a time @xmath8 , the quadrature activities @xmath39 and @xmath40 are time averages of the @xmath5- and @xmath33-quadratures of the light leaving the system .",
    "we will gain yet further insight into the dynamics of the systems we study by examining general quadratures of the form @xmath41 where the angle @xmath42 in phase space is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . for these general quadratures",
    ", we can consider marginal distributions @xmath43 associated with general quadratures , which can be extracted from the relevant ld functions @xmath44 and their @xmath0-derivatives using eqs .   and  .    in the following subsections we will introduce the mathematical formalism which allows us to construct @xmath0-biased ensembles and",
    "show how the appropriate ld functions are derived .",
    "we will also explore doubly - biased ensembles where we study the typical trajectories of one observable for ensembles of trajectories biased by another observable .",
    "we develop this formulation in section  [ sec : s2 ] , but we first discuss how the ld functions for ( singly- ) biased ensembles are derived .",
    "previous studies on quantum - jump trajectories  @xcite have demonstrated that one may identify the ld function @xmath18 as the largest eigenvalue of an @xmath0-modified master equation obeyed by @xmath45 ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the generator for the @xmath0-biased dynamics .",
    "we will outline how to construct formally these generalized master equations in terms of an it calculus and characteristic operators , before proceeding to apply them to the study of quadratures in sec .  [",
    "sec : s1 ] .",
    "we consider the system to be weakly coupled to a reservoir in the markovian regime  @xcite ; within this picture the reservoir is treated as a bath of harmonic oscillators which effectively act as a white noise source to our system .",
    "this type of reservoir admits a stochastic description whereby the effects of reservoir ladder operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with commutator @xmath50 = \\delta ( t - t')$ ] are described by it increments which obey a quantum it calculus  @xcite .",
    "we next sketch our method within this formalism ; we give full details of the derivation in appendix  [ sec : der1 ] .    for the rest of the paper we consider the reservoir to be an unsqueezed vacuum @xcite .",
    "we introduce temporal increments @xmath51 and @xmath52 which are defined in terms of the reservoir ladder operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 by    @xmath55    and are evaluated in the immediate future .",
    "the dynamics are found using a stochastic density matrix @xmath56 whose it increment is related to the system hamiltonian , @xmath57 , the reservoir increments defined above and the lindblad operators of the system @xmath58 :    @xmath59dt-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}\\{{l}^{\\dag}_{i}{l}_{i},\\rho\\}dt\\\\   & + \\sum_{i}{db}^{\\dag}\\left(t \\right){l}_{i}\\rho\\left(t \\right){l}^{\\dag}_{i}db\\left(t \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\sum_{i}{db}^{\\dag}\\left(t \\right){l}_{i}\\rho(t)\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_{i}\\rho\\left(t \\right)db\\left(t \\right){l}^{\\dag}_{i}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    tracing out the reservoir degrees of freedom , one obtains the familiar lindblad master equation  @xcite for the ( trace - preserving ) system dynamics :    @xmath60-\\sum_{i}\\{{l}^{\\dag}_{i}{l}_{i},\\rho^0 \\}+ \\sum_{i}{l}_{i}\\rho^0{l}^{\\dag}_{i}\\label{eq:3e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the anti - commutator and @xmath62 is the density matrix of the system , with @xmath63 denoting the trace over the reservoir hilbert space .    to modify this trace - preserving scheme to the desired @xmath0-biased generalized master equation for trajectories of @xmath7",
    ", we introduce a characteristic operator , @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding stochastic increment d@xmath7 is related to the reservoir increments in eq .  .",
    "the characteristic operator is defined by    @xmath65    from this operator we identify @xmath0-biased reduced density matrix as    @xmath66    using eq",

    "then , application of the it calculus of d@xmath7 in terms of reservoir increments   allows the trace to be taken over the reservoir degrees of freedom ( see appendix  [ sec : der1 ] ) .",
    "this method of deriving @xmath47 relies upon the existence of a complementary stochastic reservoir operator to the system operator of interest .",
    "we discuss these operators next for the cases of quantum jumps and quadratures .",
    "we turn our attention to statistics of quantum - jump trajectories , before moving on to quadrature trajectories , where @xmath69 .",
    "a quantum - jump trajectory is the time record of the number of jump events @xmath29 over a time @xmath8 .",
    "we formulate the stochastic process associated with jump trajectories in terms of an increment @xmath70 . in terms of the reservoir increments",
    "this jump increment is defined as @xmath71 which has eigenvalues of 0 and 1 within the interval @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "although @xmath70 tells us how many photons were emitted into the bath in the interval @xmath72 $ ] , it tells us nothing else about the form of the light emitted .",
    "we address questions about the quantum state of emitted light by looking at the statistics of the quadrature trajectories of the light emitted into the reservoir .",
    "we use the @xmath5- and @xmath33-quadratures to define coordinate axes of the optical phase space ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we will also study the general quadrature operator where the observable is @xmath73 , defined in eq .  , where @xmath42 is the polar angle .",
    "the stochastic increments associated with these operators , @xmath74 , are defined by    @xmath75    evaluation at @xmath76 and @xmath77 yields the increment for the familiar @xmath5- and @xmath33-quadratures .",
    "although @xmath74 takes the same form for all @xmath42 , the form of the stochastic process @xmath70 associated with the jump trajectories is very different .",
    "therefore , for the rest of this paper we use notation where @xmath29 is biased by a conjugate field @xmath78 , while the quadratures @xmath79 are biased by @xmath0 . with this notation",

    "finally we note that , although introduced for a specific set - up , this formalism is not restricted to pure states and allows a freedom of choice for the reservoir provided we stay within the markovian approximation .",
    "for example , it may be readily generalized to a squeezed thermal reservoir .",
