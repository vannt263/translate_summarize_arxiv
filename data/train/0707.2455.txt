    "one of the main topics in the physics - beyond - the - standard - model is the attempt to understand fermion representations . from this point of view , models with extra dimensions are useful as they can lead to chiral 4d effective theories , both in standard kaluza - klein ( kk ) scenarios @xcite and in brane worlds @xcite . in some cases , in addition to a chiral spectrum , one can also obtain tachyonic scalar fields @xcite that can be candidates for the higgs field in 4 dimensions .",
    "these properties are intriguing as a natural question is whether or not there exists a more fundamental relation between the chiral asymmetry , which we observe in our world , and the higgs mechanism .",
    "the answer to such a question would also help us to understand the structure of the standard model ( sm ) , which actually possesses the following very special feature : vector - like representations always correspond to unbroken gauge symmetries , that is the electromagnetic and the color gauge symmetries , whereas chiral representations are associated to the broken part of the sm gauge group .",
    "is this just a coincidence or is there a deep reason ?    in the present paper",
    "we argue that there could be an explanation for that in the framework of higher dimensional models .",
    "more precisely we construct a simple 5d model in which a 4d chiral asymmetry and the higgs mechanism are related in a way that , when we continuously turn on the higgs order parameter , a vector - like fermion representation becomes chiral .",
    "this property emerges quite naturally in theories where left - handed and right - handed fermions are ( dynamically ) localized on two different branes . in this type of constructions , one important theoretical issue is the gauge invariance of the 4d effective theory . indeed ,",
    "if a chiral asymmetry appears in the 4d effective theory , it may happen to have a gauge anomaly .",
    "however , we leave the study of anomalies for a future work and concentrate here on a semiclassical approximation .    in fact , even the purely bosonic sector of the low energy theory can appear to be not gauge invariant .",
    "we address this problem by considering a simple bosonic completion , which includes an abelian gauge field and a charged scalar .",
    "our 5d bosonic action also includes some _ weight functions _ that may have their origin in warped compactifications of more fundamental theories @xcite . by considering a simple set up for the weight functions ,",
    "we prove that , in the case in which the 5d gauge symmetry is broken , the action for the light modes generally can not be written as a gauge invariant action ( with at most a spontaneous breaking of the gauge invariance ) .",
    "however , we also show that the values of the observable quantities are extremely close to the predictions of a gauge invariant theory .",
    "when the 5d gauge symmetry is restored , the 4d effective theory acquires an exact gauge symmetry and , remarkably , this happens when the fermion representation becomes vector - like and a gauge anomaly can not appear .    here",
    ", we also comment on the nature of the higgs mechanism that is used to achieve the main purpose of the paper : we clarify that , in our model , it is not possible to study the higgs mechanism directly in the 4d effective theory and we provide some link to a previous work on this topic @xcite .",
    "this seems a very important point that one should keep in mind in performing dimensional reductions , where it is usually assumed that tachyons in the 4d effective theory can consistently trigger the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed , our 5d model represents a counter example for such a procedure .",
    "finally , we discuss non - abelian generalizations of the simple aforementioned @xmath0 model .",
    "in particular we discuss the @xmath1 case and describe our mechanism in a model that resembles the electroweak theory in the low energy limit .",
    "however , it is unclear if a complete phenomenological description of the masses and the interactions of the observed particles can be achieved in this type of models . indeed , in the minimal set up that we consider in the paper the correct interactions of the z vector boson can not be reproduced and it seems quite difficult to achieve realistic fermion and vector boson masses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ basic ] we explain in more detail our basic idea and we study a 5d spinor field coupled to a background gauge field and a domain wall configuration . then , in section [ bcompletion ] we provide a simple bosonic completion in which the gauge field is promoted to a dynamical field associated to a ( spontaneously broken ) gauge symmetry .",
    "therefore , we are ready to turn in section [ 4deff ] to the study of the gauge invariance of the 4d effective theory . in section [ extensions ]",
    "we study the non - abelian extensions .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we provide the conclusions and some outlook .",
    "we leave to the appendix a technical discussion on the gauge fixing .",
    "in this section we explain how a relation between the higgs mechanism and the low energy chiral asymmetry can occur .",
    "we would like to construct a model in which exact low energy gauge symmetry corresponds to a vector - like spectrum whereas the broken phase is associated to a chiral one . here",
    "we show that this idea can be implemented by starting with a higher dimensional model .    as a matter of fact the 4d gauge fields coming from dimensional reductions have generally a constant wave function along the internal dimensions . in the presence of a higher dimensional higgs mechanism ,",
    "these gauge fields become massive and in general acquire a non - trivial profile     +   +     ( dashed line ) , which configuration ( b ) leads to .",
    "as we can see , the left - handed mode is peaked on @xmath2 , whereas the right - handed mode is peaked on @xmath3 , which actually represents a single point because the extra dimension is periodic .",
    "since the effective coupling constants between the fermions and the vector field are given by the overlap integral between the function in plot @xmath4 and the absolute value squared of the fermion profiles in plot @xmath5 , we expect a 4d chiral asymmetry in the broken case , which should disappear when we take the unbroken limit .",
    "we will return to this simple example in subsection [ fermioncompact ] , where we will render the discussion more quantitative .",
    "moreover , in subsection [ fermioninf ] we shall prove that our basic idea can be also implemented in the presence of an infinite extra dimension and , therefore , is not based on the fact that the internal space is compact .",
    "here we also stress that some ingredients that we used in this section are well - known in the literature of higher dimensional model building : the fact that a non - trivial profile of the light gauge fields can emerge from a higgs mechanism and modify the 4d effective coupling constants have already been found @xcite . as an original part here",
    "we establish that this effect can actually be applied to find a relation between the higgs mechanism and the low energy chiral asymmetry .      in this subsection",
    "we review the basics of 5d fermions on domain walls in order to fix our conventions and to quantitatively implement our idea .    the simplest set up for the fermion action @xmath6 to realize our mechanism consists of a 5d spinor @xmath7 and a domain wall configuration @xmath8 , which traps 4d fermions with different chiralities in different points of the fifth dimension .",
    "therefore , we write @xcite s_f = d^5 x(^m d_m+ ) , [ faction]where @xmath8 is assumed to be a non dynamical field , which depends on the fifth dimension @xmath9 , but is independent of the 4d coordinate @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the 5d gamma matrices ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "moreover , the covariant derivative @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a dynamical 5d gauge field and @xmath16 the corresponding fermion charge .",
    "action ( [ faction ] ) corresponds to the following equation of motion ( eom ) : ^md_m+ = 0.[feom ]    we are now interested in the linear version of ( [ feom ] ) with respect to the dynamical fields , in order to extract information on the fermion spectrum . by assuming the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath15 equal to zero , this linearization is ( + ^5_y+)=0 , [ lfeom]where @xmath17 and we have introduced the 4d gamma matrices @xmath18 and the 4d chirality matrix @xmath19",
    ". we can now proceed in a standard way and project ( [ lfeom ] ) onto the left - handed and right - handed subspaces : _ r + ( _ y + ) _",
    "l=0,_l + ( -_y + ) _ r=0 , [ eomlr]where we used @xmath20 .",
    "we want now to study the 4d spectrum and , therefore , we perform a kk decomposition as follows can be a discrete or a continuous variable . ] : _ l , r(x , y)=_n ^(n)_l , r(x ) f_l , r^(n)(y ) . from ( [ eomlr ] )",
    "it is trivial to obtain and solve the equations for the zero modes , which are defined by @xmath21 .",
    "we have f_l^(0)(y ) , f_r^(0)(y ) .",
    "[ zeromodes]on the other hand , the equations for the massive modes , which satisfy @xmath22 , are ( -_y^2+v_l , r)f^(n)_l , r = m^2_n f^(n)_l , r,[lrschroedinger]which are schroedinger equations with potentials @xmath23 .",
    "we can focus only on the schroedinger equation for one chirality , say the left - handed wave functions @xmath24 , because the right - handed counterpart can be obtained by using the relation @xmath25 , which also follows from ( [ eomlr ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonians that appear on the left hand side of ( [ lrschroedinger ] ) are hermitian .",
    "this property can be proved by deriving the eom from the action and by requiring that the boundary terms , which come from the integration by parts , vanish .",
    "we now return to the simple set up that we have qualitatively discussed at the beginning of this section with the help of plots @xmath4 , @xmath27 and @xmath5 . as an original discussion , in this subsection",
    "we quantitatively study how a low energy chiral asymmetry and the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the gauge symmetry can emerge from a single mechanism in this simple case .",
    "we observe that plot @xmath27 corresponds to the configuration @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a positive constant and @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "this domain wall background leads to the following left - handed and right - handed zero modes wave functions : f_l^(0)(y)&=&\\{hy } , + f_r^(0)(y)&=&\\{-hl+hy } , where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ zeromodes ] ) and the normalization constants have been computed in a way that the kinetic terms for @xmath34 are canonically normalized . we notice that both the zero modes satisfy the @xmath26 boundary conditions without loss of generality . ] , and that the discontinuity of @xmath8 on @xmath2 and @xmath35 induces a discontinuity of the derivatives of both the zero modes there .",
    "it is now easy to see that the zero mode profiles have the shape given in plot ( c ) .",
    "moreover , the left - handed zero mode is exponentially localized on @xmath2 and the right - handed one on @xmath35 , that is we have = = e^-hl .",
    "[ loczero]eqs .",
    "( [ loczero ] ) tell us that the bigger is the dimensionless parameter @xmath36 the stronger is this localization mechanism .",
    "as we pointed out at the beginning of this section , we now require the lightest wave function @xmath37 coming from @xmath38 to depend on some order parameter @xmath39 for the breaking of the 5d gauge symmetry . moreover , we require @xmath37 to be peaked on @xmath2 for @xmath40 and to correctly reduce to a constant in the unbroken limit ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "for example we could choose f_0(y)=n_0 e^-a^2(v ) y^2 , [ gaussian]with @xmath42 in the unbroken limit .",
    "wave function ( [ gaussian ] ) is obviously of the form presented in plot @xmath4 .",
    "now it is already clear that we have a chiral asymmetry in the low energy theory for @xmath40 . in order to discuss quantitatively this mechanism we give the couplings between the light 4d fermions and the light 4d vector field . ] : g_l = e_f , g_r = e_f , where the integrals are performed over the complete range of @xmath9 ( in this case @xmath43 ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath44 , we have an exact vector - like spectrum ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "but , in the case @xmath40 , we have a big chiral asymmetry @xmath46 when the distance @xmath47 between the left - handed and the right - handed branes is large , for fixed @xmath29 and @xmath48 .      in the last subsection",
    "we have considered a compact extra dimension . here",
    "we show that an equivalent result can be obtained in the presence of an infinite fifth dimension ( @xmath49 ) . indeed , since the fermion localization is achieved by the field @xmath8 and the remaining 4 dimensions are of course assumed to be infinite , it is natural to have also an infinite fifth dimension .",
    "moreover , the set up that we present here provides a non vanishing mass for the lightest fermions .    in this subsection",
    "we consider the following configuration for @xmath8 : ( y ) = h(y)-m , [ phi2]where @xmath29 and @xmath50 are positive constants with dimension of mass and @xmath47 is again a length scale .",
    "( [ phi2 ] ) , which corresponds to the first plot of figure [ infinite ] , represents the simplest example of a two domain wall system .    by using ( [ zeromodes ] )",
    "we obtain the following solutions to the zero mode equations : f^(0)_l(y ) & & , + f^(0)_r(y ) & & .these functions are both non normalizable and therefore they decouple from the interactive sector of the effective theory .",
    "this means that the lightest non - trivial mode is a couple of massive ( weyl ) fermions .",
    "here we want to find explicitly their corresponding mass and wave functions and so we consider the schroedinger eqs .",
    "( [ lrschroedinger ] ) for the massive modes : in this case the potentials for the two chiralities are v_l , r = & & ( h^2 - 2hm)(y)+m^2 + & & h , where @xmath51 is the dirac delta function which emerges from the derivative of the step function @xmath52 .",
    "we observe that the smooth parts in @xmath53 and @xmath54 are equal .",
    "however , the left - handed modes are subjected to a delta function with a negative coefficient at @xmath2 and with a positive one at @xmath35 , whereas , for the right - handed modes , the delta functions are interchanged .",
    "therefore , we expect the lightest ( massive ) mode to be made of a left - handed mode localized on @xmath2 and a right - handed mode localized on @xmath35 . to improve this localization mechanism we also impose @xmath55 , which , because of @xmath56 , implies @xmath57 .     +    by analyzing the schroedinger equation for @xmath58 with standard quantum mechanics methods , we find the following bounded solution : f_l= \\{a_l ( qy ) y<0 , +   + a_l 0yl , +   + a_l(ql - qy ) y>0,.[flmassive]where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are two positive is a necessary condition for normalisability . ]",
    "constants defined by q^2m^2-m^2 , k^2(h - m)^2-m^2 , and @xmath61 is a normalisation constant .",
    "moreover , @xmath62 represents the mass of this solution , which should be computed by solving the following algebraic equation : ( kl)=. [ massfermioneq]the corresponding solution for @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 as the potentials satisfy @xmath65 .",
    "we now want to compute explicitly @xmath62 and show that , for large values of @xmath47 , @xmath58 is localized on @xmath2 and @xmath63 is localized on @xmath35 . to this end",
    "we observe that @xmath66 goes to @xmath67 with exponential velocity when @xmath68 and , by plugging this result into ( [ massfermioneq ] ) , we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we try a solution of the form @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are some positive constants , namely a solution that goes exponentially to zero when @xmath68 . by using this ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ massfermioneq ] ) , we obtain m^2 = 4 m^2 ( 1-)^2 + ... , [ appmassfermioneq]where the dots are small corrections of the order @xmath73 $ ] . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath47 is large , we can take just the first term in eq .",
    "( [ appmassfermioneq ] ) . since we have an explicit expression for @xmath62 , we can now study the profile of @xmath74 by plugging ( [ appmassfermioneq ] ) into ( [ flmassive ] ) .",
    "the result is that @xmath58 is exponentially localized on @xmath2 and @xmath63 is exponentially localized on @xmath35 .",

    "we provide the shape of @xmath58 and @xmath63 in the second plot of figure [ infinite ] .",
    "we could proceed as in subsection [ fermioncompact ] and prove that a big chiral asymmetry emerges in this case if @xmath47 is large and if the gauge field @xmath76 satisfies the hypothesis that we mentioned in subsection [ fermioncompact ] . in the next section",
    "we shall discuss how these properties of the gauge field can be generated in a dynamical way .",
    "in the last section we assumed @xmath15 to have the following properties :    1 .",
    "the spectrum of the 4d vector fluctuations is made of a light mode and a tower of heavy kk modes .",
    "the light spin-1 mode wave function is peaked on the left - handed brane if and only if the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the main purpose of the present section is to obtain dynamically these properties in a simple way .    to this end",
    "we introduce , apart from a 5d @xmath0 gauge field @xmath15 , a charged higgs field @xmath77 with a mexican hat potential and we assume the following bosonic action . ] : s_b = d^5 x\\{-f_mnf^mn- _ s } , [ sb]where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath39 are real constants , @xmath82 is a positive constant and the _ weight functions _ @xmath83 and @xmath84 depend only on @xmath9 .",

    ", the kk mass scale becomes very small in standard kk scenarios , where one does not introduce any weight function and assumes a compact internal space .",
    "instead , by choosing @xmath83 and @xmath84 in a suitable way , we can decouple the kk mass gap and the volume of the internal space . in the following",
    "we shall take an infinite extra dimension ( @xmath86 ) as the localization of the spin-1 and spin-0 fields can be obtained by means of the weight functions .",
    "here we do not describe the origin of the weight functions , but we observe that they may arise for example from warped solutions of field theories that include gravity @xcite . for this reason we shall refer to the model defined by @xmath87 as a 5d warped higgs model .",

    "we first have to consistently fix a gauge in order to focus only on the physical spectrum coming from @xmath15 and @xmath88 .",

    "we have a first light mode with mass squared @xmath116 , which vanishes only for @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding wave function @xmath48 is f_0(y)=n_0.hence , for @xmath44 we have a constant profile corresponding to a massless gauge field , whereas in the broken case @xmath40 the lightest spin-1 field acquires a mass and it is localized on @xmath2 by means of a gaussian distribution of the form ( [ gaussian ] ) .",

    "this is true not only because the correct interactions of @xmath242 can not be reproduced , but also because it seems difficult , at least in this simple set up , to achieve the correct fermion and vector boson masses .",
    "indeed , we could think to introduce some yukawa interactions in the 5d lagrangian in order to obtain a realistic fermion mass spectrum , but then we would probably introduce a non - universality in the gauge interactions of different families .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of the vector bosons is also problematic because the value of the @xmath255-parameters appearing in ( [ t - parameters ] ) are not necessarily proportional to the masses of the vector bosons ( like in the sm ) .",
    "indeed , these masses must be computed by solving the eqs ( [ eom - spin-1 ] ) and therefore will depend in general on the shape of the wave functions .    however , we consider the present discussion interesting as we found a relation between the chiral asymmetry and the higgs mechanism in a model that resembles the electroweak theory in the low energy limit . we plan to study more general and possibly realistic implementation of our mechanism in a future phenomenological extension of the present theoretical work",
    "in this paper we have proposed a mechanism that relates the chiral asymmetry to the 5d higgs mechanism , which generates masses for the low energy degrees of freedom . to illustrate the basic idea",
    "we have analyzed a 5d fermion and , as a bosonic completion , we have considered a simple 5d _ warped _ higgs model .",
    "such mechanism exploits the fact that the 4d gauge field profile along the extra dimension is generally constant if the gauge symmetry is unbroken , but it can be peaked around some point , for example @xmath2 , in the broken case .",
    "this point also represents the 4d world where fermions with a given chirality live , whereas the other chirality can be localized on another point @xmath35 , by means of a domain wall configuration .",
    "a specific feature of our mechanism is that , in the case @xmath40 , the bosonic action of the 4d effective theory generically can not be written as a gauge invariant action with at most a spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry .",
    "this statement has been proved by choosing some specific values of the weight functions , which may have their origin in warped compactification of theories of gravity or supergravity .",
    "indeed , for these specific values , all the bosonic profiles along the extra dimension are simply 1d harmonic oscillator wave functions and , therefore , many observable quantities can be explicitly computed .",
    "then , we have considered two possible physical definitions of the 4d gauge constant , which must coincide in a gauge invariant theory .",
    "the first definition can be obtained from the decay amplitude of the physical higgs field @xmath172 into two light vector bosons @xmath182 , whereas the second one comes from the scattering @xmath256 .",
    "these coupling constants turned out to be different , even if their relative difference is a very small quantity , of the order of the square of the ratio between the _ electroweak _ scale and the lightest heavy mode mass .",
    "remarkably , the 4d effective theory becomes gauge invariant , at least at the semiclassical level , as @xmath41 that is exactly the limit in which the chiral asymmetry disappears .    as a consequence of the aforementioned results , the higgs mechanism , which we triggered in order to achieve our purpose , can not be described by a purely 4d method , that we called 4d effective theory approach to ssb and defined in subsection [ 4dvs5 ] .",
    "indeed , the latter method is expected to be correct at the leading order in @xmath139 in standard kk theories , but in our model breaks down because of the presence of an additional parameter , @xmath47 . by taking into account @xmath119 corrections ,",
    "such a method turned out to be incorrect even without fermions .",
    "this is not very surprising , because the 4d effective theory is expected to be correct only at energies much smaller than the heavy kk mode mass , but is still interesting because in our model the @xmath119 corrections are the first non - trivial corrections .",
    "moreover , we commented that a relation between the chiral asymmetry and the higgs mechanism can also emerge in non - abelian generalizations of the warped higgs model with fermions , which we have previously analyzed .",
    "we showed that the unbroken directions in the lie algebra space correspond to vector - like interactions in the low energy theory , whereas the remaining directions present a chiral asymmetry .",
    "as an explicit non - abelian example we considered the electroweak group @xmath257 and we obtained , by using a simple set up , a low energy limit that resembles - but does not entirely reproduce - the standard electroweak theory . some of the reasons why the simple implementation that we considered is not realistic are the fact that the correct interactions of z are not reproduced and it seems difficult to obtain realistic fermion and vector boson masses .    an interesting development of the present work can be the extension of the simple implementation presented in this paper to a theory which exactly reduces to the sm at low energies .",
    "for example , extensions of this type might be the introduction of more than two branes , general yukawa couplings and general weight functions in the higher dimensional model .",
    "moreover , it would be nice to have an embedding of this type of models in a more fundamental theory which includes gravity .",
    "indeed , this may lead to a dynamical origin of the domain wall configuration @xmath8 and the weight functions .",
    "finally , another interesting direction is the complete calculation of the heavy mode contribution to the 4d effective theory , including the effect of the heavy fermion fields : an exact cancellation of the chiral anomaly may happen as in previous works @xcite and some observational effects could emerge @xcite .",

    "we assume @xmath262 to be infinitesimal as the general case can be addressed by considering an infinite number of infinitesimal transformations .",
