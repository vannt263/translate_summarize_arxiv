    "since aharonov and bohm discussed in their celebrated paper @xcite the significance of the phase that arises from the charge - flux interaction , now known as the aharonov - bohm effect , it has been one of the most important subjects in both experimental and theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "the subject spreaded diverse branches and recently has developed into the anyon physics @xcite which has wide range of applications , including the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite and the high-@xmath1 super - conductivity @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss in some detail the latest development in this direction , that is , the non - abelian chern - simons quantum mechanics @xcite and the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "recently we proposed a classical action for a system of the non - abelian chern - simons ( nacs ) particles and developed a quantum mechanical description for them .",
    "the nacs particles are point - like sources which carry non - abelian charges and interact with each other through the non - abelian chern - simons term @xcite .",
    "their interaction is essentially the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect , just as the interaction between anyons is the aharonov - bohm effect .    the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect , however",
    ", is not a newly raised issue : it was considered long ago by wu and yang @xcite and its details were studied in a test - particle framework by horvthy @xcite .",
    "wu and yang proposed a gedanken experiment to test the existence of the @xmath2 isotopic spin gauge field : they consider a scattering of the beam of protons , neutrons or their mixture around a cylinder where an isotopic magnetic flux is confined .",
    "a rotating cylinder made of heavy elements with a neutron excess was suggested as a source of the non - abelian magnetic flux .",
    "the existence of the isotopic @xmath2 gauge field would be manifested through the non - integrable phase factor , upon which the outcome of experiment depends .",
    "recently it has been in the limelight again as it becomes clear that the nacs particle and the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect might be realized in various physical phenomena such as the fractional quantum hall effect , cosmic strings @xcite , and the gravitational scattering in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "the nacs particles are in a sense non - abelian generalization of anyons .",
    "their physical properties are similar to those of anyons , but can be certainly distinguished from . while anyons acquire fractional spins and satisfy exotic statistics , the nacs particles acquire fractional but rational spins and exhibit yet more generalized braid ( or non - abelian ) statistics @xcite . in this respect , it is quite interesting to apply the nacs particles to those physical phenomena , in some generalized context , where anyons play important roles , and to scrutinize the outcome .",
    "such attempts have been made in refs.@xcite where the possibility for the nacs particles to be realized in the fractional quantum hall effect , the paradigm of anyons , is discussed .",
    "the nacs particles may manifest their existence also in somewhat different circumstances .",
    "such examples include the vortices in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions and the cosmic strings in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions which are formed when some gauge group @xmath3 is broken down via higgs mechanism to some discrete non - abelian subgroup @xmath4 @xcite . since interactions between these objects are characterized by the holonomies , equivalents of wu and yang s non - integrable phase factors , associated with the windings around themselves , their interactions are effectively non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the point - like sources which gravitationally interact with each other in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions also belong to the examples . since the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional gravity is equivalent to the non - abelian chern - simons theory of group @xmath5 @xcite , they are nacs particles with the internal symmetry group of @xmath5 . accordingly the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional gravity can be also discribed in the framework of the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss how to construct a classical action describing non - abelian chern - simons particles and analyze its constraint algebra . in sec .",
    "iii we apply the coherent state quantization to the chern - simons gauge fields and introduce a gauge fixing condition , called holomorphic gauge , where the gauss constraints are explicitly solved . then in sec .",
    "iv we obtain a quantum mechanical description of the nacs particles and show that they obey braid statistics .",
    "v is devoted to the two body problem in non - abelian chern - simons quantum mechanics . in sec .",
    "vi we evaluate the differential cross section of the non - abelian aharonov - bohm scattering . in sec vii",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief summary and a discussion on applications of the non - abelian chern - simons quantum mechanics .",
    "a classical description of point - like sources with non - abelian ( isospin ) charges can be given in terms of their spatial coordinates and the isospin vectors which transform under the adjoint representation of the internal symmetry group .",
    "endowing them with the corresponding non - abelian magnetic fluxes to make them the nacs particles is done by introducing the non - abelian chern - simons term and minimally coupling their isospin charges with the chern - simons gauge fields . to be specific and to avoid unnecessary burden , we take the internal symmetry group to be @xmath2 throughout the paper .",
    "( for discussions on the nacs particles with @xmath6 , @xmath7 isospin charges , consult ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "although there are several equivalent ways @xcite to define the isospin degrees of freedom , we find it convenient to define the isospin vectors directly on the reduced phase space @xmath8 for the @xmath2 internal symmetry group as follows @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the coordinates of the internal @xmath8 and @xmath11 is a constant . denoting the spatial coordinates of the particles by @xmath12 , @xmath13",
    ", we can construct the classical lagrangean as @xmath14 @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 = \\epsilon^{abc } t^c$ ] , @xmath19 , and the space - time signature is @xmath20 .    with the defining equations for the isovectors eq.([iso ] ) , we obtain the following euler - lagrangean equations @xmath21",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the first two equations are wong s equations @xcite and the third one corresponds to the gauss law constraint which tells us that the nacs particle of isospin charge @xmath26 carries the magnetic flux @xmath27 ; @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes a small patch covering the position of the @xmath30-th nacs particle .",
    "since the part of lagrangean for the isospin degrees of freedom is usually of first order , second class constraints arise in the procedure of canonical quantization .",
    "these second class constraints are entangled with the first class constraints which generate gauge symmetries and it makes the constraint analysis difficult @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages we have , to define the isovectors as in eq.([iso ] ) is that it is easy to avoid the second class constraints from the outset by judiciously defining the poisson bracket @xcite . introducing the canonical momenta @xmath31 , @xmath32 we can convert the given lagrangean eq.([lag ] ) to a first order lagrangean @xmath33 @xmath34\\ ] ] @xmath35",
    "this first order lagrangean can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath36 and the euler - lagrangean equations from eq.([forder ] ) as @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 denote collectively the canonical variables , @xmath31 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "when the matrix @xmath50 is non - singular , i.e. , has its inverse @xmath51 as in eq.([pre ] ) , the poisson bracket is taken as @xmath52 and the euler - lagrangean equations can be expressed as @xmath53    from eqs.([pre ] ) and ( [ poiss ] ) , we can define the poisson bracket as @xmath54\\ ] ] @xmath55 and the fundamental commutators as @xmath56 @xmath57    as expected , the gauss law constraints @xmath58 form @xmath2 algebra and no further constraints arise @xmath59 in contrast to the approach of balachandran _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the second class constraints never appear in ours .",
    "if one can solve the gauss constraints explicitly , one can describe the dynamics of the nacs particles solely by the quantum mechanical hamiltonian @xmath60 in eq.([first ] ) with @xmath61 which are determined through the gauss constraints .",
    "thus it is desirable to solve the gauss constraints explicitly , if possible . we may attempt to solve the constraints in coulomb or covariant gauges , but find it difficult .",
    "however , as we shall see , there are two gauge conditions where the constraints have explicit solutions .",
    "the first one is the axial gauge condition . considering the nature of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions",
    ", one can easily understand how the axial gauge works .",
    "choosing an axial gauge condition , say , @xmath62 , we get a solution for the gauss constraint @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an arbitrary function of @xmath65 .",
    "unfortunately , it is rather awkward to describe the dynamics of the nacs particles with the axial gauge solution because of the strings attached on them .",
    "( analyzing the the well - known anyon quantum mechanics in the axial gauge @xcite may give us an idea .",
    "but we will not pursue it here . )",
    "the alternative is the holomorphic gauge condition which we shall discuss in the following section .",
    "if one adopts the coherent state quantization @xcite for the gauge fields , one can choose a better gauge condition .",
    "we recall that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are canonical conjugates to each other , i.e. , @xmath68 , or upon quantization @xmath69 = i\\kappa\\delta^{ab}\\delta({\\bf x}-{\\bf y})$ ] .",
    "this suggests for us to define ` creation ' and ` annihilation ' operators @xmath70 @xmath71 = \\delta^{ab}\\delta({\\bf x}-{\\bf y})\\ ] ] and to construct coherent states @xmath72 and their adjoints @xmath73 then we have @xmath74 and the resolution of identity @xmath75 partitioning the time interval @xmath76 $ ] into many pieces and repeatedly using the resolution of identity eq.([resol ] ) , we obtain a functional integral representation for the transition amplitude ( in the sector of gauge fields ) @xmath77 @xmath78\\biggr\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is obtained by substituting @xmath80 , @xmath81 in the given hamiltonian @xmath82 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath83 and @xmath84 must be treated as independent variables @xcite .    in order to get the path integral representation of the physical transition amplitude @xmath85 ,",
    "now we include the particle sector @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 for the sake of convenience , we employed in eq.([ampli ] ) complex coordinates where @xmath91 @xmath92 adopting the coherent state quantization for the chern - simons gauge fields @xcite effectively extends the gauge orbit space in that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are treated as independent variables @xcite .",
    "it implies concurrently that there are wider class of gauge fixing conditions available in the frame - work of the coherent state quantization : we can choose , @xmath93 , as a gauge fixing condition . this gauge fixing condition may be called holomorphic gauge condition . in this gauge , the gauss constraint reduces to @xmath94 and has an explicit solution @xmath95 which is less singular that that in the axial gauge eq.([axial ] ) . as we shall see , it is amusing to observe that the dynamics of the nacs particles lies entirely in the holomorphic sector of @xmath96 in the holomorphic gauge .    reaching this point",
    ", one may realize that the holomorphic gauge may not be connected to the more conventional gauges such as coulomb and axial gauges by canonical gauge transformations and may worry about the equivalence of the path integral , representing physical amplitude in the holomorphic gauge to those in the conventional ones .",
    "this worry can be taken care of by the brst formulation @xcite as discussed in ref.@xcite : the equivalence of the path integral in the holomorphic gauge to those in conventional gauges follows from the fradkin and vilkovisky theorem @xcite . in the frame - work of the coherent state quantization ,",
    "the holomorphic gauge condition is a legitimate gauge fixing condition .    employing the coherent state quantization for the gauge fields , we write the path integral representing the physical transition amplitude @xcite as @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the gauge condition . in the holomorphic gauge @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "unless we consider a nontrivial topology for the two dimensional space , @xmath103 is not singular .",
    "since it is independent of dynamical variables , it can be dropped from the path integral .",
    "therefore we find that the path integral is now reduced to @xmath104",
    "the quantum mechanical description of the nacs particles is obtained if we integrate out the field variables . by use of the given solution in the holomorphic gauge eq.([sol ] ) , we get the path integral expressed only in terms of the quantum mechanical variables @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the holomorphic gauge solution eq.([sol ] ) .",
    "the operator formulation of the chern - simons quantum mechanics follows from the observation that the path integral eq.([qmpath ] ) is equivalently expressed as @xmath109 @xmath110 the variables with ` @xmath111 ' denote quantum operators of which commutators are given by @xmath112 = i,\\quad [ { z}_\\alpha , \\hat p^{\\bar z}_\\alpha]= i,\\quad [ \\hat q^a_\\alpha,\\hat q^b_\\beta ] = i\\epsilon^{abc } \\hat q^c_\\alpha \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}.\\ ] ] the gauge field @xmath113 here stands for the operator version of the solution eq.([sol ] ) .",
    "since the iso - vector operators @xmath114 s satisfy the @xmath2 algebra , they can be represented by @xmath2 some generators , say , @xmath115 in a representation of isospin @xmath116 .",
    "for example , when @xmath117 , @xmath114 s are represented by the pauli matrices @xmath118 and the state vector @xmath119 by an iso - spin doublet .",
    "we suppressed the isospin indices in eq.([qmop ] ) . in passing , note that @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "we now conclude that the dynamics of the nacs particles are determined by the hamiltonian @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 where @xmath126 and it needs an appropriate regularization .",
    "the second term and the third term in @xmath127 describe mutual and self interactions of nacs particles respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian eq.([ham ] ) without the self interaction terms has been conjectured and applied to the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect by verlinde @xcite .",
    "the mutual interaction terms in @xmath122 are responsible for the non - abelian statistics .",
    "this becomes clear as we remove the interaction terms by some singular non - unitary transformation , _ i.e. _ casting the wave function @xmath128 for the nacs particles in the holomorphic gauge into the following form @xmath129 where @xmath130 satisfies the knizhnik - zamolodchikov ( kz ) equation @xcite @xmath131 the hamiltonian for @xmath132 is a free hamiltonian @xmath133 .    in eq.([wave ] ) we suppress the effects of the self interaction for the following reason .",
    "the self interaction terms can be also removed in a similar way as the mutual interaction terms are removed . as a result",
    ", we may have a factor @xmath134 in the r.h.s . of eq.([wave ] ) .",
    "this factor is not well defined until we specify how to take the limit @xmath135 . here",
    "we take the limit near @xmath136 along @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a complex number with @xmath139 and @xmath140 is a real parameter to be taken @xmath141 in the limit",
    ". then the factor eq.([factor ] ) is factorized into a divergent piece @xmath142 and a regular one @xmath143 since the divergent piece eq.([facd ] ) can be absorbed into a normalization constant of the wave function , the quantum mechanical hamiltonian for the nacs particles does not contain any singularity .",
    "we may further absorb the constant regular factor eq.([facr ] ) into the phase of the wave function .",
    "therefore we may safely remove the self interaction terms in the nonrelativistic hamiltonian eq.([ham ] ) for the nacs particles as in the case for the anyons @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of the relativistic quantum mechanics for the nacs particles , the regular factor eq.([facr ] ) can not be no longer ignored : noting that the regularization procedure described above corresponds to the framing of the knots @xcite which represent the world lines of the relativistic nacs particles , we may identify the anomalous spins of the nacs particles as @xmath144 from the additional phase which the wave function acquires due to the regular factor under @xmath145 rotation .",
    "the kz equation has a formal solution which is expressed as a path ordered line integral in the @xmath0-dimensional complex space @xmath146,\\label{kzsol}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 is a path in the @xmath0-dimensional complex space with one end point fixed ( reference point ) and the other being @xmath148 .",
    "explicit evaluation of the above formal expression will give the monodromy matrices .",
    "we see that @xmath132 obeys the braid statistics , due to the transformation function @xmath149 while @xmath128 satisfies ordinary statistics . in analogy with the abelian chern - simons particle theory we may call @xmath132 the nacs particle wave function in the anyon gauge .",
    "the two descriptions for the nacs particle - one in the holomorphic gauge with @xmath128 and @xmath4 in eq.([ham ] ) and the other in the anyon gauge with @xmath132 and the free hamiltonian - are equivalent and the transformation function between two gauges is given by @xmath149 eq.([kzsol ] ) .",
    "it also defines the inner product in the holomorphic gauge @xmath150 where @xmath151 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the holomorphic gauge eq.([ham ] ) is certainly hermitian with this inner product @xmath152    when @xmath153 , the kz equation is particularly simple and the solution for the kz equation can be easily obtained @xmath154.\\ ] ] therefore if we exchange the positions of two nacs particles along an oriented path as depicted by fig .",
    "1 , the wave function in the anyon gauge transforms as @xmath155 the operator @xmath156 is called the braid operator or half - monodromy which satisfies the yang - baxter equation and exhibits some character of the non - abelian statistics .",
    "if we wind one nacs particle around the other , _ i.e. _ doubly exchange , the transformation of the wave function of the system is given by the monodromy operator @xmath157 , @xmath158",
    "being equipped with the non - abelian chern - simons quantum mechanics discussed in the previous section , we now specifically consider a system of two nacs particles .",
    "although two body system does not reveal all the novel features of the nacs particles , it certainly enables us to capture some essence of them .",
    "since two body problem is presently the only one known to have explicit solutions , it is worth while to explore the two body system in some detail .",
    "this section also serves as a preparatory stage for the discussions on the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect in the following section .",

    "indeed it may be regarded as the hamiltonian for the system of two nacs particles in coulomb gauge in a sense .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , in general , the gauss constraint can not be solved explicitly in coulomb gauge in that the constraint is nonlinear in this gauge . however ,",

    "going through the same analysis given in sections v and vi with the symmetrized wave function eq.([symm ] ) , we find that the scattering amplitude @xmath253 for the scattering of indistinguishable nacs particles in the isopsin @xmath116 channel is given in terms of @xmath219 eq.([scatj ] ) by @xmath254 @xmath255+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\theta}\\frac{\\sin\\omega_j\\pi } { \\sin\\theta/2}\\left(1+e^{i\\left([\\omega_j]+1/2\\right)(2\\theta-\\pi)}\\tan \\theta/2\\right).\\]][scatb ] then we obtain the scattering amplitude matrix @xmath256 @xmath240\\theta}}{1-e^{i\\theta}}\\left(1 + e^{i\\left([\\omega]+1/2\\right)(2\\theta-\\pi)}\\tan \\theta/2\\right)\\ ] ] @xmath257 + 1/2\\right)(2\\theta-\\pi)}\\tan \\theta/2\\right).\\ ] ] this yields the differential cross section for the indistinguishable nacs particles @xmath258 @xmath259 + 1)\\theta\\right ) \\tan\\theta/2\\right\\}|m_1,m_2>.\\ ] ]",
    "description of nacs particles often involves field degrees of freedom , since they are usually described as isospin particles of which isospin charges are coupled to non - abelian chern - simons gauge fields .",
    "however , it is not necessary to rely upon the non - abelian chern - simons gauge fields to discuss the quantum mechanics of nacs particles .",
    "the non - abelian chern - simons gauge fields are to be completely determined in principle in terms of the quantum mechanical degrees of freedom of the isopsin particles through the gauss s law constraints , i.e. , they themselves do not have dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "their only role is to introduce a topological interaction between the isospin particles , endowing them with non - abelian magnetic fluxes .",
    "thus , if we solve the gauss law constraints explicitly , we are able to describe the dynamics of nacs particles solely by a quantum mechanical hamiltonian .    in this paper",
    "we have shown that the gauss law constraints can be solved explicitly in the framework of coherent state quantizaion in an appropriately chosen gauge and discussed the dynamics of the nacs particles , based upon the obtained quantum mechanical hamiltonian , especially the non - abelian aharonov - bohm scattering : in the framework of the coherent state quantization , we are able to choose the holomorphic gauge condition to fix the gauge degrees of freedom thanks to the enlarged gauge orbit space and obtain the quantum mechanical hamiltonian which governs the dynamics of the nacs particles through the kz equation entirely in the holomorphic sector .",
    "the obtained quantum mechanical hamiltonian enabled us to discuss the scattering of nacs particles in parallel to the discussion of the aharonov - bohm scattering . evaluating the differential scattering cross section",
    ", we confirmed , yet in a more concrete way , the results which were previously obtained by verlinde @xcite and by lo and preskill @xcite .",
    "however , scattering amplitude which we obtained differs from theirs in details , in particular , it is single valued in contrast to that of lo and preskill .",
    "we conceive that the gauge condition chosen implicitly in ref.@xcite be different from ours and it may make such a difference . a close comparison between the two approaches would be worthwhile .    incorporating an additional @xmath260 electromagnetic field into the nacs particle theory , we can construct the model which has been proposed to describe some fractional quantum hall states called singlet quantum hall effect states @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian quantum mechanics developed in this paper will be certainly useful to explore their physical properties .",
    "the proposed non - abelian chern - simons quantum mechanics also gives us immediate helps in discussing @xcite some subjects , in more generalized context , which have been previously discussed in the anyon theory such as construction of exact many - body wavefunctions @xcite and evaluation of the second virial coefficient @xcite .",
    "although only the nacs particles with @xmath2 symmetry group is discussed in this paper , our discussion on the nacs particles is not limited to the case of @xmath2 .",
    "many of formal properties of nacs particles with @xmath2 are expected to be shared among those with other symmetry groups . for an example , the formal expression of the scattering matrix in terms of the monodromy eq.([scatmm ] ) may hold in general .",
    "a construction of the quantum mechanical hamiltonian for nacs particles with @xmath6 , @xmath7 symmetry group is presented in ref.@xcite and analyses on the nacs particles with more general symmetry groups are currently in progress @xcite . as we mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the nacs particles make their appearances in various circumstances .",
    "for instance , they may appear as gravitationally interacting point - like sources in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , as non - abelian vortices in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , or cosmic string with some discrete non - abelian charges in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "since the coherent state quantization and the holomorphic gauge fixing apply also to the models describing those nacs particles of various kinds , it will be certainly interesting to develop the non - abelian chern - simons quantum mechanics for them and to discuss the related subjects in the framework given in this paper .",
