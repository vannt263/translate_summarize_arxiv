    "there have been wide interests in the study of the topological objects such as the vortices @xcite , monopoles @xcite , and instantons @xcite because of their importance for understanding some crucial aspects of the nonlinear field theories @xcite .",
    "they are not included in the original action manifestly , but appear as the localized finite energy solutions of the nonlinear field equations .",
    "these solutions can be classified with the topological number which comes from the topological property of the system .",
    "since the topological objects have spatially localized , finite energy configurations and some topologically conserved charge , it is fascinating to regard them as dynamical degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "one of such objects is the abrikosov vortex @xcite in ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , which appears as the magnetic flux squeezed by the cooper - pair condensate .",
    "when the external magnetic field applied to the superconductor exceeds some critical strength , the cooper - pair is dissociated and the node of the cooper - pair forms a vortex line .",
    "the single - valued property of the cooper - pair around vortex lines leads the quantization of the total magnetic flux , as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represent the effective gauge coupling of the cooper - pair , the total magnetic flux and the topological number , respectively .",
    "the topological number @xmath1 characterizes the topology of the system and we can classify vortices in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "there exist many applications employing the concept of the abrikosov vortex and its relativistic version , the nielsen - olesen vortex @xcite .",
    "one example is the squeezed color - electric flux between the quark and anti - quark in qcd",
    ". nambu @xcite , t hooft @xcite and mandelstam @xcite discussed that there exist the vortices which appear as the color - electric flux tubes squeezed by the condensation of magnetic monopoles .",
    "as a result of the color - electric flux squeezing , we can only observe colorless mesons and baryons , which are color singlet bound states of the colored quarks with the bond of the color - electric flux .",
    "this scenario is a possible explanation for `` color confinement '' , which is the experimental fact in hadron physics @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd monte carlo calculations @xcite for @xmath6 @xcite and 3@xmath7 @xcite potentials strongly support the flux tube picture , and show the universality of the string tension of the flux - tube , @xmath8 0.89 gev , in both @xmath6 and 3@xmath7 cases .    an another example is the cosmic string in astrophysics as a seed of the galaxy formation and baryogensis @xcite .",
    "kibble @xcite and zurek @xcite discussed the distribution of the topological defects and their cosmological evolution after the quench of the early universe and the resulting phase transition .",
    "they argued that the cosmic strings as topological defects would produce a characteristic signature in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "following their scenarios , the phase transition dynamics are closely investigated in the numerical simulations using the phenomenological time - dependent gl ( tdgl ) theory @xcite in both cases with global symmetry and local gauge symmetry . in particular , in the case of the gauge symmetry , it is discussed that the initial thermal magnetic fluctuations just after the quench play important roles on the later distribution of the vortices such as the clusters of vortices @xcite .",
    "these investigations are closely correlated with the condensed matter physics in a viewpoint to understand the phase transition dynamics , and provide the interesting subjects to link different fields of research .",
    "now we turn to the dynamical aspects of single vortex as a `` pseudo - particle '' . for the treatment of the vortex motion ,",
    "the vortex is usually regarded as one dimensional ( 1-d ) thin object like a string , neglecting the extension perpendicular to the vortex line .",
    "such a treatment is expected to be sufficient when the length of the string is much larger than the length scale in the radial direction .",
    "this condition comes from the fact that the excitation energy of string as a 1-d object is typically @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the string length ) .",
    "then , for the vortex with large length , the stringy excitation is more important than radial one with changing its thickness .",
    "even if the above condition is not well - satisfied , we have only to consider extensive modes of the magnetic flux when the type - ii nature is very strong , i.e. , the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath11 is very large ( here @xmath12 is the penetration depth of the magnetic field and @xmath13 is the coherence length of the higgs field ) .",
    "this is because when type - ii nature is very strong , the topological defect of the higgs field along the vortex line is strongly squeezed and its extension modes perpendicular to the vortex line cost a large energy .",
    "then , in the type - ii limit of the vortex , the main excitation is given by the stringy modes , and the subject is linking to one of the most fundamental problems in the quantum string theory@xcite , which gives not only a candidate of the grand - unification including gravity but also a new method to analyze nonperturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "so far , there are so many interesting studies done on the quantum string . for instance",
    ", the quantum fluctuations of the string lead to a  roughening \" , i.e. , a widening of the string @xcite , and several studies of quantum nielsen - olesen strings @xcite showed that quantum vibrational modes make the vortex world - sheets crumpled and dominated by  branched - polymers \" as a disease of quantum strings@xcite .",
    "however , we sometimes encounter the cases where the vortex can not be regarded as a stringy object .",
    "we are interested in such cases .",
    "one example is the type - ii superconductors in condensed matter physics near @xmath2=1/2 , i.e. , bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld ( bps ) @xcite value or critical coupling . in such cases , the squeezing of the magnetic flux due to",
    "cooper - pair condensation is not very strong and both the cooper - pair and photon fluctuations can play important roles .",
    "moreover , their interplay may provide interesting phenomena .",
    "an another interesting example is the quark systems such as the meson and baryon which have the color - electric flux tube with the total length about 1 fm , which is not very large in comparison with the flux tube extension of about 0.4 fm .",
    "in addition , according to the analysis using the dual - ginzburg - landau model @xcite , type - ii nature also seems to be not so strong , and then the radial motion of the vortex can play an important role .",
    "studies on such excitation modes are important to understand the structure of hadrons . for the gluonic excitations , the lattice qcd studies for heavy @xmath6 @xcite and 3@xmath7 @xcite system both provide the 1st gluonic excitation energy as @xmath14 1 gev in the the total length of the flux , @xmath15=0.5 - 1.0 fm , as the typical hadronic scale . small dependence on @xmath15",
    "provides the possibility to understand the 1st gluonic excitation as not simple stringy vibration but the radial excitation with the fixed boundary effects on the flux - tube , because the simple stringy mode is likely to behave proportionally to 1/@xmath15 .",
    "the studies on the energy of the radial excitation with comparing it to that of lattice results will give a qualitative explanation for the gluonic excitations in the case of relatively small but not too short @xmath15 .",
    "there seem to exist several other cases where the radial excitations play important roles .",
    ", width=321 ]    putting applications to the above examples in perspective , we will discuss the axial - symmetric radial excitation modes and their propagation along the vortex line .",
    "hereafter , we will call this excitation mode _",
    "peristaltic _ mode .",
    "the schematic picture of the peristaltic mode is shown in fig.[fig : peristic ] . to discuss the peristaltic modes",
    ", we utilize the abelian higgs action which includes the higgs and the photon fields . in terms of this action ,",
    "the peristaltic modes are characterized by the higgs and photon field fluctuations . in particular , the time - dependent photon fluctuations , which are sometimes neglected ,",
    "play important roles on the corporative behavior with the higgs field fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are regarded as the vibration of the vortex from the viewpoint that the vortex is the dynamical degrees of freedom in the system .    in this work , since we concentrate on the radial excitation modes , we simply neglect the effects of the boundary of the vortex edge , considering the vortex with the infinite length .",
    "the bending of the vortex is also neglected .",
    "we investigate both type - i and type - ii vortices with not only usual @xmath1=1 but also @xmath16 for the future applications to the non - equilibrium or multi - vortices systems where the giant vortices can appear as excited states . in the type - i case ,",
    "if the system contains only finite magnetic flux in contrast to the equilibrium case usually realized in the laboratory , these flux gather and become a @xmath17 2 giant vortex because type - i vortices attract each other . on the other hand , in the type - ii case , the giant vortex is unstable and splits into the small vortices . in spite of this , when @xmath2 is not too large , it is worth considering the vibration of the giant vortex because the gradient of the vortex - vortex interaction is small for the small separation of vortices @xcite and we can expect that the fission process develops slowly .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly review the treatments of the static profile of single vortex .",
    "in sec.iii we derive the effective action and the resulting equation of motion for the fluctuations around the vortex .",
    "the effects of the static vortex background on the fluctuations are emphasized . in sec.iv",
    "we show the numerical results for the excitation modes of the @xmath1=1 vortex with 0.1@xmath18@xmath2@xmath191.0 .",
    "based on the classification with @xmath2 , we closely discuss their excitation energy , correlation energy between the higgs and photon fields , spatial distribution of fluctuations , and the resulting magnetic flux behavior .",
    "it will be shown that , in the case of @xmath20 1/2 , the interplay of the higgs and the photon fields plays an essential role for the existence of the new - type discrete pole .",
    "we also discuss the excitation modes around @xmath21 2 vortices . in sec.v",
    "we summarize this paper with the perspective for the future direction .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the treatments of the static vortex in terms of abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "this type of action is very popular and has been used to describe cosmic string in the astrophysics @xcite , the color flux tube in qcd @xcite , and so on .",
    "we use this lorentz invariant action to investigate the properties of the vortex as a `` pseudo - particle '' .    for the finite temperature cases , one usually uses the phenomenological model with replacing the 2nd time - derivative in abelian higgs model with the 1st derivative although the microscopic foundation of this treatment is still not conclusive .",
    "the noise term is sometimes further added .",
    "these replacements change the equation of motion from the wave equation to the diffusive equation which respects the dissipation effects due to the thermal fluctuations .",
    "we will discuss the finite temperature case elsewhere .",
    "let us consider the ideal system which contains only one vortex with infinite length along the @xmath22-axis .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the excitation mode of the vortex in such a system .",
    "we start with the following action with natural units ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the higgs field and photon field respectively . here",
    "@xmath27 are the effective gauge coupling constant , the strength of self - coupling , and the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 denote space - time coordinates and @xmath29 . through this paper , we describe the variables in physical unit with bar . for later convenience",
    ", we rescale the fields and the coordinates to make them dimensionless quantities , @xmath30 we also rewrite the action @xmath31 the energy relation between the physical and our rescaled unit can be obtained with noting the following relation , @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are lagrangian in physical and rescaled unit , respectively , and they are related as @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the energy and momentum in the physical unit with multiplying @xmath36 to our rescaled energy and momenta .",
    "after these rewriting , the action reads @xmath37 here we have introduced the gl parameter @xmath38 , which is used to distinguish the type - i ( @xmath39  ) and type - ii ( @xmath40  ) superconductors . the critical case of @xmath41",
    "is called as the bps case , which lies between type - i and type - ii . as a remarkable fact in the bps case ,",
    "the photon mass @xmath42 and the higgs mass @xmath43 coincide as @xmath44 , because of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 , which can be derived from the original action ( [ action1 ] ) .    in this work",
    ", we will consider the system which is translation invariant in the @xmath22-direction and contains single vortex with infinite length along the @xmath22-axis .",

    "these are confirmed by the studies of the vortex - vortex interaction analytically in large separation case @xcite and numerically in arbitrary distance case @xcite .    the qualitative understanding for the potential property is as follows .",
    "the attractive part of the potential comes from the reduction of the topological defect of the higgs field condensate .",
    "this is because the total energy of the system decreases when the domain of the normal conducting state decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "the repulsive part comes from the magnetic field interaction of the vortices .",
    "then , in the case of @xmath851/2 where the coherence length of the higgs field exceeds the penetration depth of the magnetic field , the attractive part becomes larger than the repulsive part in the whole region , and the vortex - vortex potential becomes attractive . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath861/2 , the relation is reversed and the vortex - vortex potential becomes repulsive .    in the case of the vortex - anti - vortex case ,",
    "the potential becomes attractive independently from @xmath2 since the magnetic field interaction between the vortex and the anti - vortex becomes attractive in contrast to the vortex - vortex case , and there is no repulsive part in the potential .",
    ", width=264 ]     , width=264 ]    although we consider the isolated vortex under the idealized situation from the beginning , it is worth mentioning under which situations single vortex appears referring to the potential properties explained above . in type - i superconductor , the multi - vortices with total topological number @xmath87 transfer to the single , giant vortex with topological number @xmath87 due to their attractive interaction . after the successive fusion processes , the multi - vortices system transfers to the normal conducting state .",
    "for the finite size superconducting materials under the homogeneous magnetic fields and thermal equilibrium , such fusion processes lead the difficulty to observe the type - i vortices because the magnetic fluxes successively invade from the interface between the normal and superconducting phase .",
    "nevertheless , under the non - equilibrium situations or inhomogeneous magnetic fields concentrated on the small area , it is expected that the type - i vortex or , more generally , the domain of the normal state in the superconductor can appear as a transient state in the process such as the dynamical evolution of the thermodynamic unstable state into the equilibrium state , i.e. , the nucleation or spinodal decomposition processes @xcite . from the viewpoint of the particle physics ,",
    "an another interesting situation where type - i vortex appears is the case where magnetic monopoles are immersed in superconductors and the isolated vortex emerges between the monopole and anti - monopole @xcite . in this case",
    ", no collapse with the other vortices occurs and type - i vortex behaves as the stable object due to the topological charge conservation .    on the other hand , in type - ii superconductor , the giant vortex with topological charge @xmath87 fissions to the @xmath87 vortices with charge @xmath1=1 due to their repulsive nature @xcite .",
    "this repulsive interaction prevents the vortices to coalescence and , under the thermal equilibrium , the @xmath1=1 vortices form some stable structure like the abrikosov triangle lattice @xcite . then , in type - ii superconductor , the @xmath1=1 case is realistic in the thermodynamic equilibrium in contrast to type - i case .",
    "however , when the system experience a certain quenching @xcite such as the rapid change of the temperature or density , the @xmath88 vortex may be generated as the excited states .",
    "this is the reason why we also consider the type - ii giant vortex in the following .",
    "although they are unstable against the fission into small vortices , when @xmath2 is not too large , it may be interesting to consider the vibrations of the giant vortex because such vibrations can occur during the slow development of the fission process due to the small gradient of the vortex - vortex potential for the small separation of vortices @xcite .",
    "moreover , the study of the fluctuation modes of the @xmath88 vortex may give some insight for the early stage of the evolution of the giant vortex into the multi - vortices .",
    "in this section , using the results of the previous section , we analyze axial - symmetric fluctuations in the system which has only one vortex in the background . in subsection",
    "a , using the static vortex profile , we derive the _ vortex - induced potential _ for the higgs and photon field fluctuations , and the equation of motion . in subsection b",
    ", we closely discuss the potential feature to classify the type of the excitation modes .",
    "we investigate the axial - symmetric fluctuations of the higgs field and the related photon fields around the static vortex .",
    "we expand the fields with small amplitude fluctuations around the static field , @xmath89 here we only consider the axial - symmetric fluctuations and we include @xmath90-dependence at this stage .",
    "it is important to notice that , with the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) for the static solution , all the other type of fluctuations such as fluctuations of @xmath91 and the @xmath92-dependent fluctuations are _ decoupled _ from the axial - symmetric fluctuations which we consider .",
    "hence we can analyze the axial - symmetric fluctuations ( [ static ] ) independently from the other type of fluctuations and we drop off such fluctuation terms from the following lagrangian .",

    "then we call this type of new mode as the _ peristaltic _ mode of the vortex as illustrated in fig.[fig : peristic ] .",
    "we show in fig.[potential1 ] the single particle potentials @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 around the vortex for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "we can deduce the considerable information of the excitation modes from the examination of these potentials . to get the qualitative picture about the wave functions of fluctuations , it is convenient to divide the region of the coordinate space @xmath133 into three regions , _ central _ ( @xmath134 ) , _ intermediate _ ( @xmath135 ) , and _ asymptotic _ ( @xmath136 ) region in the rescaled abelian higgs model .    in the _ central _ region ,",
    "when @xmath137 , the asymptotic behavior of the potential is @xmath138 from these asymptotic behavior , it is expected that the fluctuations @xmath118 and @xmath119 around the vortex center are suppressed by the strong repulsive interaction proportional @xmath139 and their distributions are shifted to the outside .",
    "on the other hand , in the _ intermediate _ region , the strong repulsive part of @xmath130 and @xmath132 becomes weak and the attractive pocket emerges .",
    "the mixing term @xmath131 also plays an important role to enhance the mixing between the higgs and photon field fluctuations , or @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "since the @xmath131 always takes the negative value , the excitation energy is reduced when the relative sign of the @xmath140 and @xmath141 fluctuations is positive . to avoid the confusion ,",
    "we stress that the minus sign of @xmath131 does not mean attractive interaction .",
    "even if @xmath131 takes the positive value , the energy is reduced when the relative sign of @xmath140 and @xmath141 fluctuations is negative .",
    "this is also recognized from the fact that the replacement @xmath142 changes only the sign of the off - diagonal part of eq.([psi1 ] ) . in treatment",
    "up to the second order of the fluctuations , only the absolute value of @xmath131 is relevant to the mixing of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "all these features of the potentials @xmath143 make low energy modes of the fluctuations localized in the intermediate region .",
    "finally we discuss the _ asymptotic _ region .",
    "when @xmath144 , these potentials asymptotically behave as @xmath145 note that the asymptotic behaviors do not depend on the topological charge @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath131 goes to zero , the correlation between @xmath140 and @xmath141 vanishes and these fluctuations behave as independent modes .",
    "then we have only to consider the one - particle problem in this region , i.e. , we treat the asymptotic forms of eq.([psi1 ] ) as @xmath146 the values @xmath147 and @xmath148 in the lhs play roles of the ( square of ) _ continuum thresholds _ of the @xmath140 and @xmath141 respectively .",
    "these thresholds are equivalent to the masses of the fluctuations in the system with no vortex , i.e. , @xmath149 corresponds to the mass of the higgs field and @xmath150 is the photon mass generated through the anderson - higgs mechanism @xcite . then , the threshold energy for the continuum states is expressed as @xmath151 when @xmath122 is smaller ( larger ) than the thresholds , the fluctuations behave like bound ( continuum ) states .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that @xmath130 and @xmath132 take the same value in the asymptotic region and the continuum thresholds are the same both for @xmath140 and @xmath141 for the case of @xmath2=1/2 , where bps saturation occurs .",
    "this note is sometimes useful to roughly classify the type of the fluctuation spectrum in the low - energy region in terms of the type of superconductor , as is explained below .",
    "it is expected that , for type - i case ( @xmath851/2 ) , the threshold for the higgs field is lower than that for the photon field , and the higgs field fluctuation dominates over the low energy physics . for type - ii case ( @xmath861/2 ) , the relation is reversed , the photon field fluctuation dominates .",
    "we also expect that the collective properties induced by the mixing of the higgs and photon field fluctuations are most pronounced when the bps saturation occurs .",
    "this is because the strength of both fluctuations are the same order and they affect each other . in the next section , we will see the above mechanism is crucial to emerge the characteristic discrete pole around @xmath152 .",
    "in this section , we summarize the numerical results in both type - i and type - ii superconductors .",
    "the following results are obtained by solving the coupled channel equations ( [ psi1 ] ) numerically with the lattice spacing 0.02 and the lattice size 40.0 in our rescaled unit .",
    "we impose the boundary condition on the wave function @xmath118 and @xmath119 to be zero value at the box boundary . in the following ,",
    "we consider @xmath153 case .",
    "the energy and radial wave functions shown in this section are translated into those in the general @xmath154 case with the replacements @xmath155 and multiplying @xmath156 to the radial wave functions , respectively .      in this subsection",

    "the threshold for @xmath140 is shifted lower than threshold for @xmath141 , and @xmath140 can excite with smaller energy and the amplitude of @xmath140 is enhanced compared to that of @xmath141 field",
    ". then the lower excitation modes are mainly characterized by the @xmath140 field fluctuation . under the normalization condition ( [ psi2 ] )",
    ", there appears a large excess of the amplitude of @xmath140 field compared to that of @xmath141 field , and this mismatch between @xmath140 and @xmath141 leads the suppression of the mixing effect .",
    "then the properties of the lower excitations asymptotically approach to those calculated without channel coupling .",
    "the property of the discrete pole can be interpreted as the bound state of the static vortex and the fluctuating higgs field .    on the other hand , with larger @xmath158 , the enhancement of the threshold energy for @xmath140 leads the suppression of the @xmath140 field excitation , and simultaneously enhances the @xmath141 field ratio in the lower excitation modes .",
    "then the increasing of @xmath2 value leads the reduction of the mixing correlation energy which is indispensable for the appearance of the discrete pole .",
    "eventually , at @xmath159 , the discrete pole is buried in the continuum state spectrum of the fluctuating photon field and no discrete pole appears for @xmath160 .",
    "this indicates that such a pole is difficult to be identified in most type - ii superconductors .",
    "finally we consider the most interesting case , @xmath161 case , i.e. , near bps saturation . in this case , the mixing effect becomes larger , and , as a result , the correlation between @xmath140 and @xmath141 considerably lowers the excitation energy .",

    "[ tab : table1 ] , we summarize the results for the lowest excitation energy @xmath162 and their relations to the threshold energy @xmath163 , the lowest excitation energy without channel coupling , @xmath164 , and the energy differences among them . the quantity @xmath165 represents the binding energy and specifies the spatial extension of the wave functions .",

    "in fact , @xmath173 and @xmath174 denote the radial part of the higgs and the photon fluctuations in eq.([static ] ) .    in fig.[fig : n1wave ] we show the wave functions @xmath173 and @xmath174 of the low - lying modes and the corresponding magnetic fluctuations @xmath175 for @xmath2= 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 . for @xmath2 = 0.1 and 0.5 , we plot the lowest eigenfunction with radial mass smaller than the threshold @xmath167 . on the other hand , for @xmath2 = 1.0 , there is no discrete pole because the radial mass @xmath124 is larger than the threshold @xmath176 , i.e. , @xmath177 .",

    "the higgs field fluctuation considerably exceeds to the photon fluctuation .",
    "although both of fluctuation fields have the smaller excitation energy than the threshold @xmath179 and this leads localization of them around the vortex core , the distribution of the higgs field fluctuation spreads broader than that of the photon field fluctuation .",
    "this is because the lowest excitation energy @xmath168 is close to the threshold for the higgs field fluctuations , @xmath149 , and the lowest mode is characterized as the shallow bound - state between the static vortex and the higgs field fluctuation .",
    "when we change to the @xmath2=0.5 , the mixing correlation induces the corporative behavior of the higgs and photon field fluctuations and enlarges the binding energy @xmath180 . as a result ,",

    "the photon fluctuation generally induces a time - dependent magnetic flux , whose proper time - average vanishes due to the factor @xmath189 .",

    "for the continuum state , the radial photon fluctuation @xmath174 asymptotically behaves as a two - dimensional spherical wave in the homogeneous no - vortex vacuum , and hence its asymptotic part can be regarded as a non - vortex - origin fluctuation . in other words ,",
    "the continuum states can be regarded as the vortex plus a `` scattering wave '' .",

    "eventually , around @xmath159 , the discrete pole buries in the continuum , and the lowest mode becomes the continuum state of the photon field . at the same time , the correlation between the higgs and photon field fluctuations becomes very small , as seen in the lower panel in fig.[fig : n1mix ] .      in this subsection",

    "we qualitatively explain the changes of the static vortex profiles in terms of @xmath1 . since the total penetrating flux of the magnetic field is proportional to the topological number @xmath1 , the magnetic field around the vortex core increases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "then the enlarged magnetic flux pushes the higgs field outward or reduce the expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "roughly , this process spreads the normal phase region near the vortex core and leads the outward shift of the interface between normal and superconducting phase .",
    "according to the outward shift of the surface region , where the kinetic energy of the higgs field is enhanced , the maximum of the local energy density also shifts outward , as seen in the upper panel of fig.[potential2 ] .",
    "next we present the qualitative explanation for the single particle potential for the fluctuation fields .",
    "first we give the explanation for the change of @xmath130 for the higgs field fluctuation .",
    "since the area of the magnetic flux is spread with increasing @xmath1 , the intersection surface of the static magnetic and the higgs fields moves outward .",
    "this leads the outward shift of the potential @xmath130 .",
    "the changes of @xmath132 can be interpreted in somewhat indirect way as follows .",
    "the fact read off from fig .",
    "[ potential2 ] is the depth enhancement of the attractive pocket in @xmath132 with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this enables the photon field fluctuations to enhance and localize around the surface region more easily for larger @xmath1 cases .",
    "the localization of the photon field fluctuation means somewhat rapid spatial change of the wave function @xmath174 , and leads a large fluctuation of the magnetic field @xmath203 .",
    "then we can say that the depth enhancement of the attractive pocket in @xmath132 for large @xmath1 leads the large fluctuation of the magnetic field .",
    "the large magnetic fluctuation reflects the reduction of the higgs field condensate or the weakened meissner effect .",
    "in fact , the depth enhancement of the attractive pocket is closely related to the outward shift of the static higgs field distribution .",
    "finally we comment on the potential @xmath131 , which induces the mixing correlation between the higgs and the photon field fluctuations . as seen in fig .",
    "[ potential2 ] , with increasing @xmath1 , the maximum of @xmath204 shifts outward .",
    "the physical meaning of the change in this potential is naturally explained as the outward shift of the interface between the static higgs field and magnetic field because , at the interface , the fluctuations of the higgs and photon field can frequently interplay .    with increasing @xmath1 , the resulting changes in the static configurations and the vortex - induced potential lead the change of the excitation energy of the peristaltic modes .",
    "now we see the excitation spectra of the giant vortex ( @xmath205 ) and their dependence on the @xmath2 value .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath205 cases are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nspe2 ] , [ fig : nspe3 ] , respectively . for larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the excitation energy for the lowest mode becomes much smaller as expected from the arguments in the previous paragraphs . as a consequence of the depth enhancement of the attractive pocket in @xmath132 , the discrete pole appears up to considerably large @xmath2 value in the type - ii region .",
    "in such large @xmath206 cases , of course , the fission processes of the giant vortex to many @xmath1=1 vortices become important . according to the analysis for the instability of the static vortex @xcite and the interaction between two vortices @xcite",
    ", there exists no potential barrier for the fission from single type - ii giant vortex to many @xmath1=1 vortices and the giant vortex can fission through the non - axial symmetric modes .",
    "however , in spite of this observation , we have a possibility that axial - symmetric discrete poles play important roles if the lifetime ( decay width ) of the giant vortex is very large compared to the typical time scale ( excitation energy ) of the axial - symmetric fluctuations .",
    "the decay rate can be calculated through the analysis for the non - axial - symmetric modes and the fluctuations of @xmath207 , which are not considered in this work .",
    "we expect that , for @xmath2 not so far beyond the bps value , @xmath208 , the lifetime is large because the force to break up the giant vortex is small . then , if the lifetime is confirmed to be large enough , we can immediately apply our results without further consideration about the correlation between the axial - symmetric and the other modes because these modes behave independently as far as the distortion is sufficiently small , as noticed in sec.iiia .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath209 cases , since the giant vortex is stable and the axial - symmetric modes are independent from the other modes not considered in this work , the strong bound - state - like modes more easily appear than the case for @xmath210 because of non - existence of the fission processes .",
    "in addition , according to the negative surface tension , vortex with @xmath209 tends to reduce the surface area and then the axial - symmetric fluctuation becomes increasingly prominent with smaller @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the discrete pole shown in this section shares the considerable relevance to the low - energy behavior of the giant vortex with @xmath209 .",
    "in this paper , as a new - type mode beyond the stringy one , we have studied the axial - symmetric _ peristaltic _ modes of the vortex , peculiar to the extension of the flux - tube .",
    "we have investigated the peristaltic modes both in type - i and type - ii superconductors for @xmath2111 , 2 , 3 and @xmath212 .",
    "we have treated single vortex in the situation where type - i vortex can be realized without collapses with the other vortices and behaves as the stable object .    here",
    "we summarize our main results about the fluctuation modes . with @xmath213 ,",
    "the lowest excitation modes are characterized by the higgs field fluctuation binding with the static vortex . on the other hand , with @xmath214 ,",
    "the mass of the higgs field fluctuation becomes heavier and the photon fluctuation modes are relevant . for @xmath152 ( bps cases ) , there appears the characteristic discrete pole . in this case , the higgs and the photon field fluctuations have the same masses , and then both fluctuations play important roles and their corporative behavior makes the lowest excitation softer one . this mechanism is the main origin of the characteristic discrete pole . since the energy separation between this discrete pole and the continuum threshold is large around @xmath161 , the peristaltic mode may appear most clearly in the superconductor with @xmath161 .",
    "we have also investigated the fluctuation modes of the giant vortex with the topological number @xmath201 .",
    "it is found that , with larger @xmath1 , the photon field fluctuation becomes more important for the lowest eigenmode because the distribution of the static higgs field is shifted outward and the photon fluctuation can excite easily around the core .",
    "we expect that , in @xmath215 cases , the axial - symmetric excitation mode with the bound - state - like pole plays an important role in the low - energy dynamics of the vortex . on the other hand , for @xmath210 cases ,",
    "although the equations for axial - symmetric excitation modes are decoupled from those of the other modes , it is necessarily not only to investigate axial - symmetric modes but also to consider whether these excitation modes can be realized or not during the lifetime of the giant vortex . to estimate the lifetime , we have to treat the non - axial - symmetric modes and the fluctuations of @xmath207 , which drive the fission of the single giant vortex to many @xmath1=1 vortices .",
    "we expect that , for @xmath2 value not so far from the bps value , @xmath2=1/2 , the life time is long enough and we can explore the possibility of the appearance of the discrete pole .    finally , we end with a future perspective toward the further investigation for the dynamics of the vortices ( or color - electric flux tubes ) regarding them as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "although we restrict ourselves to the axial - symmetric static vortex profile and fluctuations of @xmath216 and @xmath217 , we will investigate the more general cases without using the axial - symmetric ansatz for the static profile and classify the large class of the fluctuation modes , i.e. , ( @xmath216 , @xmath218 , @xmath217 , @xmath219 ) in @xmath220 gauge , or equivalently , ( @xmath216 , @xmath221 , @xmath217 , @xmath219 ) in @xmath57 gauge , which are not fully considered in this work .",
    "for this purposes , we will calculate the static vortex profile and excitation spectrum of the fluctuations in two - dimensional analysis in near future .    for type - i case",
    ", we expect that , in low energy , the relevant excitation mode around single vortex is axial - symmetric since the type - i vortex tends to reduce the surface area owing to the positive surface tension . also from the point of view on the kinetic energy ,",
    "the axial - symmetric excitation is favorable . on the other hand ,",
    "the arguments for the type - ii case are more subtle .",
    "because type - ii vortex tends to increase the surface area according to the negative surface tension , it may be important to compare the surface energy to the kinetic energy of the distortion .",
    "for @xmath222 giant vortices , interesting subjects are remained .",
    "one of them is the calculation of the lifetime of single giant vortex for @xmath210 and the comparison to the excitation modes considered in this work .",
    "the lifetime of the giant vortex is closely related to the dynamics of the multi - vortices in non - equilibrium systems . as well as the information for the vortex - vortex potential , the information for the lifetime of single giant vortex may provide the good building block to understand the interesting but complicated phenomena such as the transition of the system from the thermodynamically unstable state to the stable one .",
    "in connection with them , we are also interested in the fluctuations between multi - vortices and their evolution through the vortex - vortex scattering @xcite . as a successive study",
    ", we would like to investigate the results of the full two - dimensional analysis for excitation modes of the vortex in both single vortex and the multi - vortices system @xcite .    in application to qcd , the dynamics of the color - electric flux - tubes , or gluonic excitations as nonperturbative modes are also important to discuss the hadrons , which are composed of quarks and color vortex between quarks . in particular , the analysis for the multi - color - flux - tube system can give an good insight to understand the color _ confinement - deconfinement _ transition in qcd , and properties of the hot and dense matter of hadrons or quarks .",
    "it is also interesting to consider heavy ion collisions and the successive occuring expansion of the hot quark matter in close analogy with the evolution of the early universe .",
