    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , discovered by the _ iras _ all sky survey , radiate quasar - like luminosities ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) as infrared dust emission @xcite .",
    "powerful energy sources , starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , must be present hidden behind dust .",
    "this ulirg population dominates not only the bright end of the local luminosity function @xcite , but also the cosmic submillimeter background emission @xcite , so that their energy sources are closely related to understanding the connection between starbursts and agns .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the majority of nearby ulirgs are energetically dominated by compact ( @xmath4500 pc ) , highly dust - obscured nuclear cores , rather than extended ( @xmath2kpc ) , weakly - obscured starburst activity in host galaxies @xcite .",
    "determining whether the compact cores are powered by agns and/or by very compact starbursts is essential , but it is not easy to distinguish the energy sources of ulirgs cores because the large amount of dust and molecular gas concentrated in the nuclei @xcite can hide the signatures of agns and make their detection difficult . if agns are obscured by dust in a _ torus _",
    "geometry , as is inferred for some types of nearby agn populations @xcite , clouds along the torus axis are photo - ionized by the agn s hard radiation . at @xmath5 pc distances from the agn , these clouds form the so - called narrow line regions ( nlrs ; robson 1996 ) , and the nlrs produce optical emission lines with flux ratios that are distinguishable from those of normal starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , agns obscured by torus - shaped dust distributions can still be detectable through optical spectroscopy ( classified as seyfert 2 or sy 2 ; veilleux et al .",
    "such obscured agns with prominent nlrs are also recognizable through strong high - excitation forbidden line emission , originating in the nlrs , in high - resolution near- to mid - infrared spectra @xcite .",
    "however , when virtually all directions around an agn become opaque to the bulk of the agn s ionizing photons ( mostly soft x - rays and uv ) , no significant nlrs develop . in such _",
    "buried _ agns , x - ray dissociation regions ( xdrs ) , dominated by low - ionization species @xcite develop , rather than nlrs , so that the signatures of buried agns are difficult to find using the conventional searches for emission lines originating in the nlrs .    to study deeply buried agns without significant nlrs , observations at wavelengths of low dust extinction are necessary .",
    "infrared @xmath0-band ( @xmath6 2.84.1 @xmath1 m ) spectroscopy from the ground is one of the most effective ways to find the signatures of such buried agns .",
    "first , dust extinction in the @xmath0-band is substantially reduced compared to shorter wavelengths ( a@xmath7 @xmath8 0.06 @xmath9 a@xmath10 ; rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; lutz et al . 1996 ) and is as low as that at 513 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "second , the contribution from agn - powered dust emission to an observed flux , relative to stellar emission , increases substantially compared with @xmath11 2 @xmath1 m .",
    "thus , the detection of a buried agn becomes more feasible than at @xmath11 2 @xmath1 m .",
    "third , normal starburst and agn emission are clearly distinguishable using @xmath0-band spectra @xcite . in a normal starburst galaxy ,",
    "emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules is excited by far uv photons in photo - dissociation regions , the interfaces between molecular gas and hii - regions @xcite . near an agn",
    ", the pah molecules can be destroyed by strong x - ray radiation from the agn @xcite .",
    "if the pah molecules are sufficiently shielded by obscuration from the x - ray emission of the central agn , the pahs can survive . however , the far uv emission from the agn will also be attenuated by the obscuration , so in a pure agn without starburst activity , the pah emission will be very weak . instead , a featureless continuum from hot ( @xmath81000 k ) , submicron - sized dust grains @xcite heated by the agn is observed . if the agn is deeply buried in dust , the 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption feature produced by ice - covered dust and/or the 3.4 @xmath1 m absorption feature resulting from bare carbonaceous dust",
    "should be observed @xcite . in reality in ulirgs ,",
    "starbursts and agns are likely to coexist .",
    "hence it is important to disentangle the energy sources of such starburst / agn composite ulirgs .",
    "this can be done using observations of pah emission : because the column densities and pressures in the interstellar medium of ulirgs are very high , the starburst regions in starburst / agn composite ulirgs should produce strong pah emission @xcite . in a pure normal starburst galaxy ,",
    "the equivalent width ( @xmath13 a line - to - continuum flux ratio ) of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature should always be high , regardless of dust extinction of the starburst @xcite , because both the pah and continuum emission are similarly flux - attenuated .",
    "if pah emission is detected in a ulirg , but its equivalent width is substantially smaller than in normal starburst galaxies , it will strongly suggest that the pah equivalent width is being reduced by the contribution to the observed spectrum of a pah - free featureless continuum , produced by the agn .",
    "thus , the presence of a powerful agn can be inferred from the equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature and dust absorption features , even if the agn is buried .",
    "in addition , using @xmath0-band spectra we have another independent way to detect the presence of powerful buried agns in ulirgs : the absolute optical depth of dust absorption features . in a normal starburst ,",
    "the energy sources ( stars ) and dust are spatially well mixed , while in a buried agn , the energy source is very compact and thus should be more centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust @xcite . in the mixed dust / source geometry , the foreground less - obscured emission ( which thus shows only weak absorption features ) dominates the observed fluxes , and therefore there are upper limits to the absorption optical depths , unless unusual abundances are considered and/or there is a very large amount of foreground dust in the host galaxy @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a centrally - concentrated energy source can show arbitrarily large optical depth , because a foreground screen dust extinction model is applicable @xcite .",
    "a few ulirgs have been found to show substantially larger optical depths than the upper limits estimated for mixed dust / source geometry , and thus suggest centrally - concentrated energy sources ( e.g. , ugc 5101 and iras 08572 + 3915 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ; imanishi et al . 2001 ; imanishi & maloney 2003 ) .",
    "these sources also display signatures of buried agns based on the equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission @xcite and observations at other wavelengths @xcite , demonstrating that this second method can also be applied to investigate the energy sources of ulirgs .",
    "a number of papers have presented @xmath0-band spectra of nearby ulirgs @xcite and their energy sources have been investigated .",
    "however , the number of the observed sources is still too small to draw statistically meaningful conclusions . in this paper",
    ", we present ground - based @xmath0-band spectra of a large sample of nearby ulirgs . throughout this paper , @xmath14 @xmath15 75 km s@xmath16",
    "mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 = 0.3 , and @xmath18 = 0.7 are adopted .",
    "the physical scale of 1@xmath19 is 0.34 kpc in the nearest source at @xmath20 0.018 , 0.91 kpc at @xmath20 0.05 , and 2.44 kpc in the furtherest source at @xmath20 0.15 .",
    "ulirgs in the _ iras _ 1 jy sample @xcite , with no obvious seyfert signatures in the optical ( non - seyfert ulirgs ) , are our main targets to look for buried agns .",
    "we restrict the sample to those at @xmath21 so that the long wavelength side of the redshifted 3.4 @xmath1 m dust absorption feature is at @xmath11 4.1 @xmath1 m ; beyond this wavelength the steeply increasing earth s atmospheric background signal degrades spectral quality drastically in the case of ground - based observations .",
    "a declination cutoff @xmath2 @xmath2226@xmath23 was also applied so that the targets are observable with small airmasses from mauna kea , hawaii , our main observing site .",
    "these selection criteria result in 24 ulirgs classified optically as liners , 17 ulirgs classified optically as hii regions , and 4 optically unclassified ulirgs , at @xmath24 0.15 in this sample , where the optical classifications are based on veilleux et al .",
    "( 1999a ; their table 2 ) .",
    "we gave highest priority to liner ulirgs because a pure buried agn is expected to produce x - ray dissociation regions @xcite and to show a liner - type optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "all 24 liner ulirgs were observed , comprising a complete sample .",
    "for the hii and unclassified ulirgs , 11 ( out of 17 ) and 2 ( out of 4 ) sources were observed , respectively .",
    "one ulirg , iras 13443 + 0822 , consists of north - eastern and south - western nuclei , which are optically classified as an hii region and a sy 2 , respectively ( veilleux et al .",
    "although this ulirg is classified as sy 2 for the whole system ( veilleux et al .",
    "1999a , their table 2 ) , we observed only the north - eastern hii nucleus .",
    "we include this source in the category of hii ulirgs , raising the number of observed hii ulirgs to 12 .",
    "the observed 12 hii ulirgs also constitute a complete sample , in the right ascension range 1021 hr .",
    "the details of the observed non - seyfert ulirgs are summarized in table 1 .",
    "in addition to these non - seyfert ulirgs , several ulirgs with obvious seyfert signatures in the optical were also observed as a control sample .",
    "there are 12 sy 2 ulirgs at @xmath240.15 and declination @xmath2@xmath2226@xmath23 in the _ iras _ 1 jy sample , excluding the above - mentioned iras 13443 + 0822 . in total , 7 sy 2 ulirgs ( table 1 ) were observed .",
    "the main aims of observing these sy 2 ulirgs are twofold : ( 1 ) to check if our @xmath0-band spectroscopic method can successfully find signatures of obscured agns in these ulirgs which we know possess obscured agns , and ( 2 ) to provide a control sample with which the properties of buried agns in non - seyfert ulirgs can be compared .",
    "@xmath0-band spectra of several sy 1 ulirgs were also obtained . for these unobscured agns ,",
    "since no significant 3.4 @xmath1 m dust absorption feature is expected , we extend the redshift restriction to @xmath25 where the longer wavelength side of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature is covered in the ground - based @xmath0-band spectrum .",
    "there are 7 sy 1 ulirgs at @xmath25 with declination @xmath2@xmath2226@xmath23 in the iras 1 jy sample , and all of these sources were observed ( table 1 ) .",
    "observations were made primarily using the ircs near - infrared spectrograph @xcite on the subaru 8.2 m telescope @xcite .",
    "several bright ulirgs were observed with cgs4 @xcite on the ukirt 3.6 m telescope , and with spex @xcite and nsfcam @xcite on the irtf 3 m telescope .",
    "table 2 provides a detailed observing log .    for the subaru ircs observing runs ,",

    "the spectra of two bright ulirgs , iras 08572 + 3915 and mrk 1014 , were taken using irtf spex @xcite .",
    "the 1.94.2 @xmath1 m cross - dispersed mode with a 16 wide slit was employed .",
    "this mode enables @xmath0- ( 2.84.1 @xmath1 m ) and @xmath26-band ( 22.5 @xmath1 m ) spectra to be obtained simultaneously , with a spectral resolution of r @xmath8 500 .",
    "the sky conditions were photometric throughout the observations , and the seeing at @xmath26 was measured to be in the range 0@xmath2750@xmath278 fwhm .",
    "a standard telescope nodding technique ( abba pattern ) with a throw of 7@xmath275 was employed along the slit .",
    "the telescope tracking was monitored with the infrared slit - viewer of spex .",
    "each exposure was 15 sec , and 2 coadds were made at each position .",
    "for the irtf nsfcam observations of iras 07599 + 6508 , 3c 273 , and iras 15462@xmath220450 , we used the nsfcam grism mode @xcite .",

    "the hkl grism and l blocker were used with the 4-pixel slit (= 1@xmath29 ) .",

    "was employed .",
    "each exposure was 1 sec , and 30 coadds were made at each nod position .",
    "an optical guide star was used for the telescope tracking , and the objects were observed in the eastern sky , where the tracking performance was well confirmed .",
    "spectra of four ulirgs ( arp 220 , iras 05189@xmath222524 , mrk 273 , mrk 231 ) were taken with ukirt cgs4 @xcite , using a 1@xmath272 wide slit , and were published in @xcite .",
    "the observing details are found in that paper .",
    "for all the observing runs , a- , f- , and g - type main sequence stars ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) were observed as standard stars , with mean airmass difference of @xmath40.1 to the individual ulirgs nuclei , to correct for the transmission of the earth s atmosphere and to provide flux calibration .",
    "the @xmath0-band magnitudes of the standard stars were estimated from their @xmath31-band ( @xmath6 0.6 @xmath1 m ) magnitudes , adopting the @xmath32 colors appropriate to the stellar types of individual standard stars @xcite .",
    "standard data analysis procedures were employed , using iraf .",
    "initially , frames taken with an a ( or b ) beam were subtracted from frames subsequently taken with a b ( or a ) beam , and the resulting subtracted frames were added and divided by a spectroscopic flat image . then , bad pixels and pixels hit by cosmic rays were replaced with the interpolated values of the surrounding pixels .",
    "finally the spectra of ulirgs nuclei and standard stars were extracted , by integrating signals over 0@xmath2792@xmath270 , depending on actual signal profiles .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed taking into account the wavelength - dependent transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the spectra of ulirgs nuclei were divided by the observed spectra of standard stars , multiplied by the spectra of blackbodies with temperatures appropriate to individual standard stars ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "flux calibration for all ulirgs but one ( iras 16090@xmath220139 ) was done based on signals of ulirgs and standard stars detected inside our slit spectra . for the subaru ircs spectrum of iras 16090@xmath220139 , since its spectrum was taken under non - photometric conditions , we calibrated its flux level based on our own @xmath0-band photometry ( @xmath0 = 13.3 ) , made on a different night using irtf nsfcam .",
    "seeing sizes at @xmath26 ( and @xmath0 ) were always smaller than the employed slit widths , and good telescope tracking performances of subaru , irtf , and ukirt were established .",
    "we thus expect possible slit loss to be minimal . to estimate this ambiguity , we divided the whole data set into sub - groups and compared their flux levels . with the exception of the highly time variable source",
    "3c 273 , the flux levels agree within 10% for most objects and 30% for the worst case , suggesting that the flux uncertainty is at a similar level , which will not affect our main conclusions significantly . for 3c 273 , time variation was clearly recognizable even during our irtf nsfcam observing run .",
    "for this source , the resulting spectrum is a time averaged one .    to obtain an adequate signal - to - noise ratio in each element ,",
    "appropriate binning of spectral elements was performed , particularly at @xmath33 @xmath1 m in the observed frame , where the scatter of data points is larger , due to poorer earth atmospheric transmission , than at @xmath34 @xmath1 m .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution at @xmath33 @xmath1 m is r @xmath35 in most cases .",
    "the atmospheric transmission curve at @xmath36 2.83.3 @xmath1 m is fairly smooth at this spectral resolution .",
    "thus , even if the net positions of the target object and standard star on the slit differ slightly ( on the sub - pixel scale ) along the wavelength direction , the standard data analysis described above is expected to produce no significant spurious features in spectra with r @xmath35 ( see imanishi & maloney 2003 ) .",
    "figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 present flux - calibrated @xmath0-band spectra of the nuclei of ulirgs optically classified as liners , hii - regions , unclassified , sy 2 , and sy 1 , respectively . for ulirgs which have more than one nuclei brighter than @xmath0 @xmath8 14.5 mag , spectra of individual nuclei are shown separately .",
    "the total number of @xmath0-band spectra is 27 for liner , 13 for hii , 2 for unclassified , 8 for sy 2 , and 7 for sy 1 ulirgs _",
    "nuclei_. @xmath0-band spectra of several ulirgs nuclei , previously presented by @xcite and @xcite , are shown again here .",
    "there are a variety of spectral shapes , but the majority of the observed ulirgs show emission features at @xmath37 = ( 1 + @xmath38 ) @xmath9 3.29 @xmath1 m , the wavelength where the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature has a peak .",
    "we thus identify these features as the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission .",
    "to estimate the strength of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature in the spectra where broad absorption features coexist and overlap with the pah emission feature in wavelength , we make the reasonable assumption that the profiles of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission in these ulirgs are similar to those of galactic star - forming regions and nearby starburst galaxies ; the main emission profile extends between @xmath39 @xmath15 3.243.35 @xmath1 m in the rest frame @xcite .",
    "data points at slightly shorter than @xmath39 @xmath15 3.24 @xmath1 m and slightly longer than @xmath39 @xmath15 3.35 @xmath1 m , unaffected by obvious absorption features , are adopted as the continuum levels to estimate the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission strength .",
    "we adopt the spectral profile of type-1 sources @xcite as a template for the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission .",
    "the adopted template reproduces the observed 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission features of the ulirgs reasonably well , with our spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] summarizes the fluxes , luminosities , and rest - frame equivalent widths ( ew@xmath40 ) of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature .",
    "the uncertainties of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission fluxes , estimated from the fittings , are @xmath420% in most cases , and @xmath830% even for ulirgs with large scatters at the wavelengths around the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission .",
    "we also tried several continuum levels in a reasonable range , to estimate possible systematic uncertainties coming from continuum determination ambiguities .",
    "the estimated 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission fluxes usually agree within 20% for ulirgs with smooth continuum emission . even in ulirgs with winding spectra ,",
    "the estimated fluxes do not differ by @xmath230% , as long as reasonable continuum levels are adopted .",
    "thus , the total pah flux uncertainties are unlikely to exceed @xmath840% even in the worst case .",
    "in addition to the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature , clear absorption features at @xmath39 = 3.4 @xmath1 m by bare carbonaceous dust @xcite was found in three liner ulirgs , iras 08572 + 3915nw , 12127@xmath221412ne , and 17044 + 6720 ( figure 1 ) , and one sy 2 ulirg , iras 12072@xmath220444n ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the unobscured @xmath0-band spectral shapes of agns are dominated by hot dust emission and almost linear @xcite .",
    "starburst galaxies also show @xmath0-band spectra that are approximately linear , aside from the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature @xcite . to estimate the optical depths of the 3.4 @xmath1 m carbonaceous dust absorption features",

    "the estimated optical depths of the 3.4 @xmath1 m absorption feature ( @xmath41 ) for these ulirgs are summarized in table 4 .    in the observed spectra of many ulirgs",
    ", other important features are present : ( 1 ) there is a spectral `` gap '' , in that the flux densities at the shorter wavelength side of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature are fainter than the extrapolation from the data points at the longer wavelength side .",
    "( 2 ) the continuum is concave . at the shorter wavelength side of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission",
    ", the continuum flux level initially decreases with decreasing wavelength , but then begins to increase again at @xmath42 @xmath1 m , and then the spectra become flat at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath43 @xmath4 2.7 @xmath1 m ) . this behavior is naturally explained by the broad h@xmath12o ice absorption feature caused by ice - covered dust grains @xcite .",
    "the signatures of this feature are found in none of the sy 1 ulirgs , as expected from the unobscured view of the agn .",
    "the emission from stars is reduced in the @xmath0-band compared to that in the @xmath26-band , whereas hot ( @xmath81000k ) dust heated by an agn has strong emission at both @xmath26 and @xmath0 . in a starburst / agn",
    "composite ulirg , if the @xmath0-band emission were dominated by the agn - powered hot dust emission , while the longer wavelength tail of the stellar emission extended to the shorter part of the @xmath0-band spectrum , then the @xmath0-band spectrum may appear to be concave .",
    "however , this scenario can not produce the observed spectral gaps ( point 1 above ) , so the detected features are ascribed to h@xmath12o ice absorption .",
    "the shortest wavelength of the h@xmath12o ice absorption feature is @xmath39 @xmath8 2.7 @xmath1 m @xcite . due to redshifting , for the majority of the observed ulirgs at @xmath44 0.07 ,",
    "the continuum on the short - wavelength side of the absorption feature is included in our @xmath0-band spectra at @xmath37 @xmath8 2.84.1 @xmath1 m .",
    "thus , continuum levels at both shorter and longer wavelength sides of important features ( broad 3.1 @xmath1 m ice absorption , 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission , and 3.4 @xmath1 m absorption ) are covered in our spectra , making continuum determination ambiguities small . to estimate the optical depth of this h@xmath12o absorption feature , we adopt a linear continuum , as we did for the 3.4 @xmath1 m absorption feature . although @xcite adopted a concave quadratic continuum to derive the lower limits , linear continua are arguably more plausible , given that both the agn and starburst components ( outside the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature ) show linear continuum emission @xcite .",
    "this h@xmath12o ice absorption feature is spectrally very broad , and the continuum level can vary slightly , depending on the adopted data points used for the continuum determination .",
    "we tried several plausible linear continuum levels , and finally adopt the lowest plausible level to obtain a conservative lower limit for the optical depth of the 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption feature ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the derived @xmath45 values for ulirgs showing this feature clearly are summarized in table 4 .",
    "two ulirgs , iras 08572 + 3915 and mrk 1014 , were observed with irtf spex , and so @xmath26-band ( @xmath46=2.02.5 @xmath1 m ) spectra were simultaneously taken .",
    "figure 6 shows the @xmath26-band spectra of these two sources .    the @xmath26-band spectrum of iras 08572 + 3915 ( figure 6 , _ left _ ) is similar to that presented by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is very red and displays no detectable co absorption features due to stars at @xmath39 @xmath2 2.29 @xmath1 m or @xmath37 @xmath2 2.43 @xmath1 m , which suggests that featureless continuum emission from dust heated by an agn dominates the @xmath26-band spectrum .    the @xmath26-band spectrum of mrk 1014 ( figure 6 ,",

    "the detection of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission clearly indicates the presence of starbursts in the majority of ulirgs . since dust extinction in the @xmath0-band is about 0.06 times as large as in the optical @xmath31-band ( @xmath46 = 0.6 @xmath1 m ; rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; lutz et al .",

    "is covered in our slit spectra , except for the nearest ulirg arp 220 ( @xmath20 0.018 ) , the small l@xmath40/l@xmath56 ratios suggest that the detected _ nuclear _ starbursts can account for only a small fraction of the infrared luminosities of the observed ulirgs . @xcite have previously found that the 6.2 @xmath1 m pah to infrared luminosity ratios in ulirgs are smaller by a similar factor than in less - obscured starburst galaxies .",
    "the 6.2 @xmath1 m pah luminosities were measured with the large apertures of _ iso _ , and yet they show a similar pah deficit : this indicates that pah emission from the host galaxies , outside our slit spectra , is not energetically important in the infrared luminosities of ulirgs @xcite .",
    "both the detected 3.3 @xmath1 m and 6.2 @xmath1 m pah emission probe modestly obscured ( a@xmath58 @xmath4 15 mag or so ) starbursts , presumably at the outer regions of the ulirgs cores .",
    "the energy sources responsible for the bulk of the infrared emission of these ulirgs must be deeply buried ( a@xmath10 @xmath59 15 mag ) .      the energetically dominant , deeply buried energy sources at the cores of non - seyfert ulirgs can be either buried agns or very compact starbursts or both .",
    "since buried agns can produce large infrared dust emission luminosities , without pah emission ( see @xmath501 ) , the small observed l@xmath40/l@xmath56 values are naturally explained .",
    "very highly obscured starbursts can also explain the small observed l@xmath40/l@xmath56 ratios , because flux attenuation of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission may be significant , while that of longer wavelength infrared emission ( 81000 @xmath1 m ) may not .",
    "these two scenarios are difficult to differentiate based on the absolute luminosities of pah emission , but can be distinguished by the _",
    "equivalent width _ of emission or absorption features . in a pure normal starburst , where hii regions , molecular gas , and photo - dissociation regions are spatially mixed ,",
    "the equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature is less affected by dust extinction ( @xmath501 ) , and so the observed value should be close to the intrinsic one ( ew@xmath40 @xmath8 100 nm ; moorwood 1986 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) , regardless of dust extinction of the starburst . on the other hand ,",
    "an agn produces a pah - free featureless continuum , with strong absorption features when the agn is highly dust - obscured .",
    "if this emission contributes significantly to an observed @xmath0-band flux , then the ew@xmath40 value should be smaller than in normal starburst galaxies .",
    "the ew@xmath40 values in starbursts have an average value of ew@xmath40 @xmath8 100 nm , with some scatter , but never become lower than 40 nm ( moorwood 1986 ) .",
    "thus , if we adopt ew@xmath40 @xmath60 40 nm as strong signatures of a significant contribution from the agn s pah - free continuum , then we can argue that the three liner ulirgs iras 08572 + 3915nw , 12127@xmath221412ne , and 17044 + 6720 possess powerful agns .",
    "all of them display strong dust absorption features at 3.1 @xmath1 m and/or 3.4 @xmath1 m , suggesting that the agns are deeply buried .",
    "@xcite estimated the nuclear @xmath61-band magnitudes within the central 4 kpc diameter ( k@xmath62 ) for the ulirgs in the iras 1 jy sample ( their table 3 ) .",
    "we combine these data with the @xmath0-band magnitudes derived from our slit spectra ( l@xmath63 ) , and find that the k@xmath62 @xmath22 l@xmath63 colors of the three ulirgs , iras 08572 + 3915nw , 12127@xmath221412ne , and 17044 + 6720 , occupy the largest ( reddest ) three values .",
    "hot dust emission heated by an agn produces redder @xmath64 colors than normal stellar emission and so the @xmath64 colors of agns are usually redder than starbursts @xcite .",
    "the red k@xmath62 @xmath22 l@xmath65 colors again support the scenario that powerful buried agns are present and produce strong hot dust emission in these ulirgs .",
    "based on the ew@xmath40 values , the presence of buried agns is strongly indicated in the three liner ulirgs discussed above .",
    "this was possible primarily because the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission expected from starbursts is exceptionally weak in these ulirgs .",
    "hence these ulirgs may be classified as almost pure buried agns . however , the nuclei of ulirgs are generally extremely rich in molecular gas @xcite , which not only fuels the existing supermassive black holes and thereby increases the luminosities of agns , but is also likely to fuel star formation .",
    "hence it is expected that , if powerful agns are present in the majority of non - seyfert ulirgs , they will coexist with starbursts .",
    "it is therefore important to look for the signatures of powerful buried agns in the cores of starburst - containing ulirgs . to detect the agn signatures in these composite cores requires more careful analysis of the spectra than for the almost pure buried agns @xcite .",
    "even if the intrinsic luminosities of a buried agn and surrounding less - obscured starbursts are similar , the flux from the buried agn will be more highly attenuated by dust extinction .",
    "in addition to this extinction , when the broad 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption feature is present @xcite , the agn flux is suppressed even more severely . in this case , the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission is not diluted significantly by the pah - free continuum produced by the agn , and so the small ew@xmath40 diagnostic can no longer be used .    to determine whether the remaining ulirgs cores consist of ( a ) modestly obscured starbursts and deeply buried _ starbursts",
    "_ , or of ( b ) modestly obscured starbursts and deeply buried _ agns _ , we use the absolute optical depth values of dust absorption features found in the @xmath0-band spectra .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath501 , these values can be used to distinguish whether the energy sources are spatially well mixed with dust , or are more centrally concentrated than the dust . here",
    "we discuss this point more quantitatively .    in a mixed dust / source geometry , flux attenuation",
    "as a function of optical depth is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the unattenuated intrinsic flux and @xmath68 is the optical depth at each wavelength ; this takes different values inside and outside the absorption features .",
    "the 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption feature is observed if dust grains are located deep inside molecular gas , are shielded from ambient uv radiation , and are covered with an ice mantle @xcite .",
    "the feature is not observed in the diffuse interstellar medium outside molecular clouds , since ice mantles can not survive exposure to the ambient uv radiation .",
    "thus , its optical depth reflects the total column density of ice - covered dust grains in molecular gas , in front of the continuum - emitting energy sources .",
    "the observed optical depth of the 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption feature is , by definition , dependent on the difference of flux attenuation between the ice absorption feature and the 34 @xmath1 m continuum outside the feature . @xcite have shown that , in a mixed dust / source geometry , @xmath69 \\\\ & = & \\ln [ ( 1+f ) \\frac{1 - e^{-0.06 \\times a_{\\rm v}}}{1 - e^{-0.06 \\times a_{\\rm v } \\times ( 1+f ) } } ] ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the fraction of dust that is covered with an ice mantle , and it is assumed that the @xmath45/a@xmath10 ratio ( the abundance of h@xmath12o ice relative to dust grains in the regions where an ice mantle can survive ) is similar to that in galactic molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "stars are formed within the high density cores of molecular clouds .",
    "if we observe such molecular clouds individually , then the energy sources should be more centrally concentrated than the gas and accompanying dust .",
    "however , starburst galaxies consist of many such stars and the energy sources will be distributed throughout the volume of the starburst @xcite .",
    "hence for observations of entire starburst nuclei , the stellar energy sources and dust will be relatively well mixed spatially ( figure 7a ) .",
    "in fact , detailed studies of the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 strongly suggest that the stars of the burst and the obscuring dust are spatially well mixed @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems quite reasonable to regard that starbursts can be represented by this mixed dust / source geometry model .",
    "the observed @xmath45 depends on a@xmath10 and the @xmath70-value , the fraction of dust that is covered with an ice mantle .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath70 values at the cores of ulirgs are similar to that in the well - studied prototype starburst galaxy m82 ( @xmath70 @xmath8 30% ; imanishi & maloney 2003 ) , then @xmath45 will be @xmath40.3 for any a@xmath10 value in a mixed dust / source geometry @xcite .",
    "in reality , the cores of ulirgs are estimated to have much higher surface brightnesses than m82 @xcite , implying a much larger ambient radiation field . in a mixed dust / source geometry , the radiation environment in the cores of ulirgs",
    "will therefore be much harsher and it will be much more difficult for ice mantles to survive than in m82 . in this geometry , the @xmath70-values in ulirgs cores must be smaller than the assumed value of @xmath70 = 30% , and thus the upper limit of @xmath71 0.3 should be robust .",
    "on the other hand , in a buried agn , the energy source is very compact and is more centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust ( figure 7b , _ left _ ) . in this geometry ,",
    "a simple foreground screen dust model is applicable and the flux attenuation is @xmath72 the @xmath45 value is expressed as @xmath73 the @xmath45 value can become arbitrarily large with increasing a@xmath10 provided @xmath70 is non - zero .",
    "in this centrally - concentrated energy - source geometry , once the shielding column density of dust and molecular gas around the central energy source becomes sufficiently large , dust grains at a given distance from the center can be covered with ice mantles ( @xmath70 @xmath2 0 ) , and so a large @xmath45 value can be produced .",
    "therefore , observing larger @xmath45 values than the limit for a mixed dust / source geometry ( 0.3 ) is another independent means to determine the geometry of ulirgs cores , and therefore the nature of the central energy sources .    aside from the three liner ulirgs with strong buried agn signatures discussed above ( iras 08572 + 3915nw , 12127@xmath221412ne , and 17044 + 6720 ) ,",
    "14 liner , 3 hii , and 2 optically - unclassified ulirgs nuclei have observed @xmath45 values larger than the threshold ( table 4 ) .",
    "note that these observed values are contaminated by weakly obscured starburst emission .",
    "hence these observed optical depths provide only lower limits to the true @xmath45 values for the central buried energy sources . for these ulirgs nuclei ,",
    "a centrally - concentrated energy - source geometry provides a natural explanation for the large observed @xmath45 values .",
    "there is one case in which a mixed dust / source geometry for the cores can exceed the threshold value of 0.3 . if the host galaxies are viewed close to edge - on and a large column density of ice - covered dust is present in the interstellar medium of the host galaxies , exterior to the starburst core , then a foreground screen model is applicable and @xmath45 can be large , just as for a centrally - concentrated energy source .",
    "however , the presence of ice - covered dust requires that the dust be located deep inside molecular gas @xcite .",
    "strong 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption is found in the dense cores of molecular gas @xcite , and such dense molecular gas , probed by e.g. , hcn ( j = 10 ) emission at @xmath53 = 88.632 ghz ( @xmath46 = 3.3848 mm ) in the millimeter wavelength range , is normally seen only in the nuclei of ulirgs ( imanishi , nakanishi , & kohno 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is thus very likely that the strong observed h@xmath12o ice absorption largely arises in the cores of the ulirgs rather than in the extended interstellar medium of the host galaxies .",
    "the large observed h@xmath12o ice absorption optical depths can thus be taken as some evidence of a centrally - concentrated energy source geometry at the cores of these ulirgs .",
    "@xcite studied the cores of seven nearby ulirgs and estimated that , in the majority ( six out of seven ) of these ulirgs cores , the emission surface brightnesses are very high ( @xmath810@xmath74 l@xmath75 kpc@xmath76 ) and close to the maximum observed values seen in the cores of galactic hii regions , even if the energy sources are uniformly distributed over the cores ( @xmath4500 pc in size ) .",
    "provided that the emission properties of the six ulirgs cores @xcite are representative of the majority of nearby ulirgs , surface brightnesses of the _ centrally - concentrated _ energy sources would be even higher , making _ exceptionally centrally - concentrated starbursts _ less likely , if not completely ruled out .",
    "agns are more natural explanations for the centrally - concentrated high surface brightness energy sources at the cores of ulirgs .",
    "we thus take the centrally - concentrated energy sources as _ tentative _ evidence for buried agns .",
    "we can apply the same argument concerning the geometry of the energy sources and dust to the absolute optical depth of the 3.4 @xmath1 m carbonaceous dust absorption feature ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this absorption feature is found if a source is obscured by bare dust grains @xcite , but absent if the absorbing dust is ice - covered @xcite .",
    "thus , the optical depth of the 3.4 @xmath1 m absorption feature traces the column density of bare carbonaceous dust grains . @xcite",
    "have quantitatively demonstrated that @xmath41 can not be larger than 0.2 in a mixed dust / source geometry .",

    "we have no way to distinguish between these two scenarios , and their energy sources remain undetermined by our @xmath0-band spectroscopic method . there are some known examples ( e.g. , ngc 4418 ) which show no obvious buried agn signatures in the @xmath0-band spectra @xcite , but almost certainly contain powerful agns based on longer wavelength data @xcite",

    "the apparent main difference between them is that the ionizing radiation from the putative agns in non - seyfert ulirgs is obscured by the surrounding dust along virtually all lines - of - sight , while dust around the agns in seyfert ulirgs is distributed in a `` torus '' , and ionizing radiation from the agns can escape along the torus axis , allowing the seyfert signatures to be detectable in the optical . in table 3 , all seyfert ulirgs nuclei show ew@xmath40 smaller than @xmath840 nm .",
    "the ew@xmath40 values of sy 1 ulirgs are systematically smaller than sy 2 ulirgs , which is reasonable because unattenuated emission from unobscured agns in sy 1 ulirgs can reduce the ew@xmath77 values more strongly than attenuated emission from obscured agns in sy 2 ulirgs . in sy 2",
    "ulirgs , the significantly smaller ew@xmath40 values than seen in starburst galaxies suggest that the strong dilution of the pah emission by the pah - free continuum produced by the agn is present . our @xmath0-band spectroscopic method has succeeded in detecting obscured agn signatures in all of the known obscured - agn - possessing sy 2 ulirgs observed , demonstrating that this method is very effective .    among the eight sy 2 ulirgs nuclei , @xcite presented vla data for four sources , and three sources show core emission ( table 3 ) .",
    "the vla core detection rate is 75% ( 3/4 ) .",
    "for the seven sy 1 ulirgs nuclei observed by us , five sources have vla data and all show radio core emission ( 100% = 5/5 ; table 3 ) .",
    "these detection rates are again clearly higher than those for ulirgs with no obvious agn signatures in our @xmath0-band spectra .",
    "figure 8(a ) plots the l@xmath40/l@xmath56 ratios of ulirgs , separated by optical spectral types . both non - seyfert and seyfert ulirgs are plotted .",
    "the median l@xmath40/l@xmath56 values are 0.1 ( liner ) , 0.2 ( hii ) , 0.09 ( sy 2 ) and @xmath40.15 ( sy 1 ) .",
    "the l@xmath40/l@xmath56 ratios do not differ significantly between non - seyfert and seyfert ulirgs , suggesting that both types of ulirgs possess detectable modestly - obscured starburst activity with similar absolute luminosities .",
    "figure 8(b ) plots the rest - frame equivalent widths of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission ( ew@xmath40 ) , separated by optical spectral types . in this plot ,",
    "sy 2 ulirgs tend to show smaller ew@xmath40 values than non - seyfert ulirgs , while sy 1 ulirgs show the smallest values .",
    "the median ew@xmath40 values are 75 nm ( liner ) , 85 nm ( hii ) , 15 nm ( sy 2 ) and @xmath44 nm ( sy 1 ) .",
    "even though the absolute luminosities of the detectable modestly - obscured starbursts are similar , less - obscured agns can have a larger contribution to the observed @xmath0-band flux , and thereby decrease the ew@xmath40 values .",
    "the trends in figure 8(a ) and ( b ) can be explained by a scenario where agns in sy 2 ulirgs tend to be less obscured by dust along our line - of - sight than agns in non - seyfert ulirgs .",
    "in fact , while many non - seyfert ulirgs show clear absorption features at 3.1 @xmath1 m by h@xmath12o ice and at 3.4 @xmath1 m by bare carbonaceous dust grains ( figure 1 , 2 , 3 ) , no such absorption features are found in the @xmath0-band spectra of sy 2 ulirgs , with the exception of iras 12072@xmath220444n ( figure 4 ) , supporting the less - obscuration scenario for agns in sy 2 ulirgs .",
    "we argue that buried agns in non - seyfert ulirgs and optically visible agns ( obscured by torus - shaped dust ) in sy 2 ulirgs are different not only in the dust geometry , but also in the dust column density along our line - of - sight , in that the dust columns toward the agns in non - seyfert ulirgs are much higher .",
    "since the dust covering factor around buried agns in non - seyfert ulirgs ( almost all directions ) is also larger than agns in sy 2 ulirgs ( torus - shaped ) , the total amount of nuclear dust must be larger in the former .",
    "the optical ( non-)detectability of seyfert signatures in ulirgs depends not on the presence or absence of powerful agns , but largely on the mass of gas and dust in the nuclei .",
    "based on the _ iras _",
    "25 @xmath1 m to 60 @xmath1 m flux ratio ( @xmath82/@xmath83 ) , ulirgs are divided into warm ( @xmath2 0.2 ) and cool ( @xmath4 0.2 ) sources ( sanders et al .",
    "the majority of non - seyfert ulirgs show cool far - infrared colors ( table 1 ) .",
    "optical spectroscopy of galaxies with warm far - infrared colors often reveals seyfert signatures @xcite , while starburst galaxies usually show cool far - infrared colors .",
    "the warm colors of galaxies showing optical seyfert signatures are usually interpreted as emission from dust in the close vicinity of an agn , whose temperature can be higher than that in starbursts , because of the higher radiation density in the former .",
    "it is sometimes argued that cool components of the far - infrared emission from ulirgs must be starburst - dominated ( e.g. , downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "however , the far - infrared color from agn - heated dust is highly dependent on the column density of dust around an agn , in that a larger column density makes the far - infrared color cooler ( @xmath82/@xmath83 ratio smaller ) .",
    "our @xmath0-band spectra suggest that buried agns in non - seyfert ulirgs are more highly dust obscured , and thus produce cooler far - infrared colors than agns in sy 2 ulirgs .",
    "figure 9(a ) compares the observed 3.3 @xmath1 m pah to infrared luminosity ratios , with _ iras _",
    "25 @xmath1 m to 60 @xmath1 m flux ratios ( i.e. , far - infrared color ) , for non - seyfert ulirgs .",
    "there is no clear trend .",
    "if the detected 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission only probes the modestly - obscured energetically - insignificant surface starbursts ( @xmath505.1 ) , and buried energy sources are responsible for the infrared emission at 25 @xmath1 m and 60 @xmath1 m , no trend is expected .",
    "figure 9(b ) compares the ew@xmath40 and far - infrared colors for non - seyfert ulirgs .",
    "the three ulirgs with almost pure buried agns , iras 08572 + 3915nw , 12127@xmath221412ne , and 17044 + 6720 , are distributed on the warm side , but iras 12127@xmath221412ne has a cool far - infrared color .",
    "thus , there is at least one example of a pure buried agn that produces a cool far - infrared color . the bulk of ulirgs with tentative evidence of buried agns are also classified as cool sources , and their far - infrared color distribution overlaps with the colors of ulirgs with no agn signatures .",
    "we next compare the properties of the two pure buried agns , iras 08572 + 3915nw and 12127@xmath221412ne .",
    "iras 08572 + 3915nw shows only 3.4 @xmath1 m dust absorption feature , with no detectable 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption . assuming galactic dust properties , a@xmath10 @xmath2 110 mag is estimated toward the inner 3 @xmath1 m continuum emitting regions , close to the central agn . on the other hand ,",
    "the bare dust column of iras 12127@xmath221412ne ( @xmath41 @xmath15 0.35 ) is estimated to be a@xmath10 @xmath2 50 mag .",
    "this source displays ice absorption ( @xmath45 ) , and the column of ice - covered dust is estimated to be a@xmath10 @xmath2 6 mag .",
    "the total dust column in iras 08572 + 3915nw may be higher than iras 12127@xmath221412ne , and yet the former source shows a warmer infrared color .",
    "this apparently contradicts the simple prediction that the far - infrared color is cooler when a larger amount of dust obscures an agn , assuming the dust properties are similar .",
    "however , iras 08572 + 3915nw and 12127@xmath221412ne are different in that strong ice absorption is found only in the latter source .",
    "ice - covered dust grains can make a cooler far - infrared color ( smaller @xmath82/@xmath83 ratio ) than do bare dust grains , because of the change of optical constants in the infrared @xcite .",
    "the cooler color of iras 12127@xmath221412ne than 08572 + 3915nw may be due to the presence of a significant amount of ice .",
    "we presented the results of infrared @xmath0-band ( 34 @xmath1 m ) slit spectroscopy of the nuclei of a large sample of nearby ulirgs in the iras 1 jy sample .",
    "ulirgs with no obvious seyfert signatures in the optical ( i.e. , liner , hii , and unclassified ) were mainly observed and spectra of 27 liner , 13 hii , and 2 optically - unclassified ulirgs nuclei were obtained . using the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission , 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption and 3.4 @xmath1 m carbonaceous dust absorption features , we investigated whether the cores of these ulirgs can be explained by very compact starbursts only , or show signatures of buried agns .",
    "since our spectra covered both the shorter and longer wavelength sides of these features , we were able to distinguish between absorption - dominated and emission - dominated sources with small ambiguities .",
    "these spectra were compared with known agn - possessing ulirgs nuclei ( 8 sy 2 and 7 sy 1 ) and we found the following main conclusions .    1 .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission , the probe of starbursts , was detected in all but two non - seyfert ulirgs .",
    "it is likely that modestly - obscured ( a@xmath10 @xmath4 15 mag ) starbursts at the surface of ulirgs cores are responsible for the detected pah emission .",
    "the observed 3.3 @xmath1 m pah to infrared luminosity ratios were smaller by a factor of 2 to @xmath210 than those found in less infrared - luminous starbursts , suggesting that the detected modestly - obscured starbursts are energetically insignificant .",
    "three liner ulirgs , iras 08572 + 3915nw , 12127@xmath221412ne , and 17044 + 6720 , showed 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission equivalent widths substantially smaller than typical values found in starburst galaxies .",
    "these ulirgs were classified as sources dominated by almost pure buried agns , with no detectable or very weak starburst activity .",
    "3 .   besides these three ulirgs , the absolute optical depths of 3.1 @xmath1 m h@xmath12o ice absorption feature were used to distinguish whether the energy sources at the cores of ulirgs are more centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust ( as is expected for a buried agn ) , or are spatially well mixed with dust ( a normal starburst ) .",
    "the large optical depths in 14 liner , 3 hii , and 2 unclassified ulirgs nuclei suggested that the energy sources are more centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust , unless a large amount of foreground ice - covered dust is present in the interstellar medium of the host galaxies , which we consider unlikely .",
    "these ulirgs were classified as showing tentative evidence for powerful buried agns .",
    "4 .   based on the optical depths of the 3.4 @xmath1 m carbonaceous dust absorption feature ,",
    "centrally - concentrated energy sources were suggested in the two liner ulirgs , iras 08572 + 3915nw and 12127@xmath221412ne .",
    "both of them had already been classified as buried agns from the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah equivalent widths , and thus powerful buried agns were consistently identified with two independent methods .",
    "5 .   in total",
    ", 17 out of 27 ( 63% ) liner ulirgs nuclei and 3 out of 13 hii ulirgs nuclei ( 23% ) showed some evidence for buried agns .",
    "the higher detection rate of buried agns in liner ulirgs than in hii ulirgs was similar to the higher detection rate of compact radio cores ( also a signature of agns ) in the former .",
    "@xmath0-band spectra of 8 sy 2 and 7 sy 1 ulirgs nuclei were obtained , and the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission was detected in 7 ( out of 8) and 5 ( out of 7 ) sources , respectively , suggesting that these seyfert ulirgs also contain detectable starburst activity .",
    "7 .   based on the equivalent widths of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission , our @xmath0-band spectra successfully detected agn signatures in all of the observed seyfert 2 ulirgs ( known - obscured - agn - possessing ulirgs ) , demonstrating that our @xmath0-band spectroscopic method is indeed effective in revealing signatures of obscured agns . 8",
    ".   the detection rate of vla radio cores was higher in ulirgs that display evidence of buried agns in the @xmath0-band .",
    "this suggested that our @xmath0-band spectroscopic method is reliable , if not perfect .",
    "9 .   among 8 observed sy 2 ulirgs , only iras 12072@xmath220444n showed a clear 3.4 @xmath1 m carbonaceous dust absorption feature .",
    "the remaining sy 2 ulirgs showed neither detectable 3.4 @xmath1 m nor 3.1 @xmath1 m absorption features .",
    "there was no systematic difference in the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah to infrared luminosity ratios between seyfert and non - seyfert ulirgs .",
    "however , sy 1 and 2 ulirgs tended to show smaller rest - frame equivalent widths of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission than non - seyfert ulirgs , with sy 1 ulirgs ( unobscured agns ) exhibiting the smallest values .",
    "the optical depths of absorption features in the @xmath0-band were also generally smaller in sy 2 ulirgs than in non - seyfert ulirgs .",
    "these results were naturally explained if agns in non - seyfert ulirgs are more highly obscured by dust along our sightline than the agns in sy 2 ulirgs . 11 .",
    "evidence for buried agns was found in non - seyfert ulirgs with both warm and cool far - infrared colors .",
    "the liner ulirg dominated by a pure buried agn , iras 12127@xmath221412ne , has a cool far - infrared color",
    ". the cool far - infrared color in this pure buried agn could be the consequences of a large dust column density around an agn , including ice - covered dust , as is implied from strong dust absorption features at 3.1 @xmath1 m and 3.4 @xmath1 m .",
    "our @xmath0-band spectroscopy revealed the presence of agns in many non - seyfert ulirgs , and these agns are thought to be obscured ( at least opaque to the agn s ionizing radiation ) along virtually all sightlines so as to be optically elusive @xcite .",
    "this dust geometry is fundamentally different from the agns in sy 2 ulirgs which are obscured by dust in a torus geometry .",
    "together with the above finding that dust column along our line - of - sight is higher in agns in non - seyfert ulirgs , it was implied that a larger amount of dust is concentrated surrounding the agns at the nuclei of non - seyfert ulirgs than seyfert ulirgs .",
    "we argued that the ( non-)detection of seyfert signatures in the optical is highly dependent on the total amount of dust and its covering factor around a central agn , and that many non - seyfert ulirgs may contain powerful buried agns .",
    "other types of careful investigations at the wavelengths of lower dust extinction are important to find new buried agns which may even be undetectable in our @xmath0-band spectroscopic method .",

    "<S> the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission , the signatures of starbursts , is detected in all but two non - seyfert ulirgs , but the estimated starburst magnitudes can account for only a small fraction of the infrared luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> three liner ulirgs show spectra typical of almost pure buried agns , namely , strong absorption features with very small equivalent - width pah emission . besides these three sources , 14 liner and 3 hii ulirgs nuclei show strong absorption features whose absolute optical depths suggest an energy source more centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust , such as a buried agn . in total , 17 out of 27 ( 63% ) liner and 3 out of 13 ( 23% ) hii ulirgs nuclei show some degree of evidence for powerful buried agns , suggesting that powerful buried agns may be more common in liner ulirgs than in hii ulirgs . the evidence of agns is found in non - seyfert ulirgs with both warm and cool far - infrared colors . </S>",
    "<S> these spectra are compared with those of 15 ulirgs nuclei with optical seyfert signatures taken for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the overall spectral properties suggest that the total amount of dust around buried agns in non - seyfert ulirgs is systematically larger than that around agns in seyfert 2 ulirgs . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the optical ( non-)detectability of seyfert signatures in ulirgs is highly dependent on how deeply buried the agns are , and that it is essential to properly evaluate the energetic importance of buried agns in non - seyfert ulirgs . </S>"
