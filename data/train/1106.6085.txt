    "the energy produced by a biological system or by an artificial device must often be converted into a more stable form @xcite . the thermodynamic efficiency and the quantum yield of this process is of prime importance for the overall performance of the energy transducer .",
    "this transducer consumes the energy of input particles , which move energetically downhill or just disappear in the process , and transfer this energy to another kind of particles moving energetically uphill . here",
    ", the quantum yield ( @xmath1 ) is defined as the number of particles at the output of the energy transducer divided by the number of input particles .",
    "the efficiency of such device can be higher when the quantum yield is more than one , i.e. , when a single input particle creates many output carriers .",
    "the generation of two or more electron - hole pairs ( excitons ) by a single high - energy photon @xcite was observed in semiconductor nanocrystals @xcite .",
    "a similar situation takes place in the @xmath2 complex embedded into the inner mitochondrial membrane as well as in the related complex @xmath0 , which mediates the electron transfer between the photosystem ii ( ps ii ) and the photosystem i ( ps i ) in the thylakoid membranes of plants and cyanobacteria @xcite .",
    "according to the generally accepted q - cycle mechanism @xcite , the transfer of _ two _ electrons from a plastoquinol molecule pqh@xmath3 to plastocyanin ( in @xmath0 complexes ) is accompanied by an energetically - uphill translocation of _ four _ protons from the negative ( n ) to the positive ( p ) side of the membrane , resulting in a quantum yield @xmath4 .",
    "we note that within the standard redox loop mechanism ( see @xcite and references therein ) , only two protons are transferred in parallel with the transfer of two electrons , implying that the quantum yield is equal to one .",
    "hereafter , we primarily concentrate on the @xmath0 complex as a biological counterpart of our artificial system . despite numerous studies @xcite , the physical mechanism of the q - cycle in @xmath2 and @xmath0 complexes is not completely understood .    in this work",
    "we analyze a simple model ( see fig .",
    "1 ) mimicking the main features of the q - cycle in the @xmath0 complex in the regime of ferredoxin - dependent cyclic electron flow @xcite . in this regime , electrons cycle between the ps i and the @xmath0 complex , which are electronically connected by a pool of ferredoxin molecules ( on the n - side of the membrane ) and by a pool of plastocyanin molecules on the lumenal ( p ) side of the membrane .",
    "we treat these two pools as a source ( s ) and drain ( d ) electron reservoirs coupled to the electron - binding sites a and b , respectively . besides the sites a and b , the membrane - embedded central complex is comprised of sites l and h , which correspond to hemes @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the complex @xmath0 . the sites a and h",
    "are assumed to be electronically decoupled as well as the sites b and l. a mobile shuttle @xmath7 ( an analog of a plastoquinone molecule ) diffuses inside the membrane , between the sites a and h ( on the p - side ) and the sites b and l ( on the n - side ) . as its biological counterpart , the shuttle has two electron sites and two proton - binding sites . at its n - position ,",
    "the shuttle takes one electron from the site a and another electron from the site h and transfers these electrons to the sites b and l.    at the n - side , the shuttle also accepts up to two protons from the stromal ( electrically - negative ) proton reservoir and donate these protons to the lumenal proton reservoir at the p - side of the membrane .",
    "when the fully populated q - molecule arrives at the p - side , one electron from the shuttle goes strictly energetically downhill , to the site b , whereas another one returns to the l - h chain to be loaded again on the shuttle .",
    "the origin of this bifurcated reaction @xcite , which occurs at the p - side catalytic center , remains unknown .    here ,",
    "we explore physicochemical conditions wherein our artificial complex is able to translocate twice as protons as the number of electrons transferred energetically downhill , from the source s to the drain d. protons are translocated energetically uphill , from the n- to p - side of the membrane .",
    "we aim at the explanation of the q - cycle operation in this artificial complex .",
    "we examine a wide range of parameters allowing the efficient performance of the q - cycle scheme .",
    "the functional principles of the q - cycle in artificial systems can provide a better understanding of the q - cycle mechanism in the natural @xmath2 and @xmath0 complexes .",
    "to simplify the problem , we divide the whole system of six electron and two proton - binding sites into four weakly - interacting subsystems : ( i ) the lh subsystem consisting of l and h sites ( with energies @xmath8 ) ; ( ii ) the shuttle q having two electron sites @xmath9 ( with energies @xmath10 ) and two proton sites @xmath11 ( with energies @xmath12 ) , ( iii ) the site a ( with energy @xmath13 ) , and ( iv ) the site b ( with energy @xmath14 ) .    the lh - subsystem is characterized by 4 microscopic states starting with the empty ( vacuum ) state , @xmath15 and ending with the doubly - occupied system : @xmath16 the electron and proton populations of the shuttle are described by 16 states , where @xmath17 is the vacuum state and @xmath18 is the state of the completely - loaded shuttle . here , we use the notation @xmath19 for an empty ( occupied ) site @xmath20 , where @xmath21 for the electron sites on the shuttle , and @xmath22 for the proton sites .",
