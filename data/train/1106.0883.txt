    "munari et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reported a rapid and steady brightening of about 0.7 mag per day in the initial stages leading to the possibility of v5579 sgr reaching naked eye visibility if the trend continued .",
    "however , the brightening lasted only for 5 days and v5579 sgr reached a maximum brightness of @xmath1 = 6.65 on 2008 april 23.541 ut as seen from its light curve ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the early optical spectrum taken during the pre - maximum phase by fujii ( 2008 ) on 2008 april 19.82 ut showed hydrogen balmer series absorption lines with h@xmath2 having a prominent p cygni profile and also several additional broad absorption lines indicating that v5579 sgr is a classical nova . the infrared spectra taken by russell et al . ( 2008 ) on 2008 may 9 showed lines of oi , ni , caii and exceptionally strong lines of ci .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the lines are approximately 1600 km s@xmath3 . even though the feii features were weak russell et al .",
    "( 2008 ) classify v5579 sgr to be a feii type nova .",
    "the lines of neutral helium had not yet formed and the strongest lines were the oi lines that are fluorescently excited by ly@xmath4 .",
    "the infrared continuum showed strong thermal emission from dust at a temperature of 1370 k. subsequent infrared observations extending to 13.5 @xmath5 m by rudy et al.(2008 ) showed significant spectral changes like substantial decrease in the line strengths and pronounced absorption dip at the line centers .",
    "there was an increase in the dust emission and associated cooling of the dust temperature to 1080 k. the formation of dust can also be seen from the light curve .",
    "after reaching the maximum , v5579 sgr followed a smooth and fast decline .",
    "this fading was interrupted , about 20 days after discovery , by a sharp decline seen in the aavso light curve consistent with the formation of dust in the nova ejecta as reported by russell et al .",

    "v5579 sgr is one of the large amplitude ( @xmath6v = 13 magnitudes ) novae observed in recent years .",
    "we present here near - infrared spectroscopic and photometric results of v5579 sgr based on observations between 5 and 26 days after the discovery .",
    "near - ir observations were obtained using the 1.2 m telescope of mt.abu infrared observatory from 2008 april 23 to 2008 may 15 .",
    "the log of the spectroscopic and photometric observations are given in table 1 and table 2 respectively .",
    "the spectra were obtained at a resolution of @xmath7 1000 using a near - infrared imager / spectrometer with a 256@xmath8256 hgcdte nicmos3 array . in each of the @xmath9 bands",
    "a set of spectra was taken with the nova off - set to two different positions along the slit ( slit width 1 arc second ) .",
    "spectral calibration was done using the oh sky lines that register with the stellar spectra .",
    "the spectra of the comparison star sao 185320 were taken at similar airmass as that of v5579 sgr to ensure that the ratioing process ( nova spectrum divided by the standard star spectrum ) removes the telluric features reliably . to avoid artificially generated emission lines in the ratioed spectrum ,",
    "the hi absorption lines in the spectra of standard star were removed by interpolation before ratioing .",
    "the ratioed spectra were then multiplied by a blackbody curve corresponding to the standard star s effective temperature to yield the final spectra .",
    "photometry in the @xmath9 bands was done in clear sky conditions using the nicmos3 array in the imaging mode .",
    "several frames , in 4 dithered positions , offset by @xmath7 30 arcsec were obtained in all the bands .",
    "the sky frames , which are subtracted from the nova frames , were generated by median combining the dithered frames .",
    "the star sao 185779 located close to the nova was used for photometric calibration ; the typical errors in the observed magnitudes are @xmath100.03 .",

    "before presenting the results proper , we estimate some useful parameters for v5579 sgr .      the light curves based on the @xmath0 band data of aavso and @xmath9 magnitudes from mt .",
    "abu are presented in fig .",
    "1 . there is a good photometric coverage of the nova s rise to maximum which lasts for almost 5 days culminating in a peak brightness of @xmath1 = 6.65 . from a least square regression fit to the post maximum light curve we estimate @xmath12 to be 8 @xmath10 0.5 d , making v5579 sgr one of the fast feii class of novae in recent years .",
    "as mentioned earlier v5579 sgr is also one of the large amplitude novae observed in recent years with @xmath6@xmath0 = 13 magnitudes .",
    "these observed values of the amplitude and @xmath12 for v5579 sgr are consistent with its location in the amplitude versus decline rate plot for classical novae presented by warner ( 2008 ) . using the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline ( mmrd ) relation of della valle & livio ( 1995 ) ,",
    "we determine the absolute magnitude of the nova to be @xmath13 the reddening is derived using the intrinsic colors of novae at peak brightness , namely @xmath14 = 0.23 @xmath10 0.06 , as derived by van den bergh @xmath15 younger ( 1987 ) .",
    "we have used the optical photometry data from the aavso to calculate @xmath16 .",
    "the observed @xmath14 = 0.95 @xmath10 0.06 results in @xmath16 = 0.72 @xmath10 0.06 and @xmath17 = 2.23 @xmath10 0.08 for @xmath18 = 3.1 .",
    "russell et al ( 2008 ) estimate @xmath16 = 1.2 using the oi lines in the spectra obtained on 2008 may 9 but remark that part of the reddening may be local to the nova as dust had already formed . our observations , discussed in a later subsection ,",
    "also clearly show the dust formation in v5579 sgr . in their study of the spatial distribution of the interstellar extinction , neckel @xmath15 klare ( 1980 )",
    "have shown that close to the direction of v5579 sgr , @xmath17 steadily increases to a value of @xmath7 1.8 mag around 2 kpc and flattens after that .",
    "the moderate value of @xmath17 estimated by us appears reasonable even though the nova is located close to the direction of galactic center .",
    "based on the above we obtain a value of the distance @xmath19 @xmath10 0.2 kpc to the nova .",
    "band spectra of v5579 sgr are shown at different epochs .",
    "the relative intensity is normalized to unity at 1.25 @xmath20,width=307,height=7 ]      the @xmath9 spectra are presented in figs 2 to 4 respectively ; line identification in graphical and tabular form are shown in fig . 5 and table 3 respectively .",
    "the infrared observations presented here cover all the phases with the first infrared spectra taken on 2008 april 23 very close to the visual maximum .",
    "these spectra are dominated by lines of hydrogen , neutral nitrogen and carbon and display deep p cygni profiles .",
    "the emission components of all these lines have become stronger in the spectra taken on 2008 april 26 and by 2008 may 3 all the lines are seen in emission .",
    "the typical fwhm of the hi lines are 1500 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a noticeable feature of these early spectra is the presence of lines due to nai and mgi . in the spectra taken on 2008 may 3 the nai lines at 1.1381 @xmath5 m , 1.1404 @xmath5 m , 2.1452 @xmath5 m , 2.2056 @xmath5 m and 2.2084 @xmath5 m and mgi lines at 1.1828 @xmath5 m",
    ", 1.5040 @xmath5 m , 1.5749 @xmath5 m and 1.7109 @xmath5 m are clearly seen . in an earlier study of v1280 sco , das et al .",
    "( 2008 ) had suggested that the presence of spectral lines of low ionization species like nai and mgi in the early spectra are indicators of low temperature zones conducive to dust formation in the nova ejecta and this is very well borne out in the case of v5579 sgr .",
    "we would like to point out the presence of a large number of strong lines of neutral carbon .",
    "these are typical of feii type nova as seen in the case of v1280 sco ( das et al .",
    "2008 ) and v2615 oph ( das et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the rising continuum is seen in the spectra taken on 2008 may 8 indicating formation of significant amount of dust in the nova ejecta .",
    "the dust continuum has started dominating on 2008 may 13 .    from the k band spectra",
    "we do not find co emission bands in the first overtone .",
    "however it is possible that such emission may be weakly present but below detection levels .",
    "it is thus useful to try and set an upper limit on the strength of the co emission and hence on the co mass .",
    "an upper limit can be set by computing a model spectrum for the co emission and using the criterion that co emission should be discernible if the calculated model strengths of the co bands are atleast 3@xmath21 times the value of the continuum noise in the co band region ( 2.29 - 2.4 @xmath5 m ) .",
    "the model co spectrum has been computed along the same lines as done for the nova v2615 oph , where co was strongly detected , and which is described in details in das et al .",
    "the model calculations were done for the temperature range of 2500 k to 4200 k corresponding to the observed values in case of novae where co has been detected and modeled ( first overtone detections have been made in v2274 cyg - rudy et al .",

    "a value of 3 - 5 @xmath8 10@xmath22 m@xmath23 is obtained for the upper limit of m@xmath24 using a distance of 4.4 kpc to the nova .",
    "theoretically , the detailed modeling of pontefract and rawlings ( 2004 ) for molecule formation and destruction in nova winds , predicts that co should form early after the outburst , remain constant in strength for @xmath7 15 days thereafter and then get rapidly destroyed . fairly consistent with this picture ,",
    "most of the co detections outlined above have indeed been reported early after the outburst ( see das et al .",
    "2009 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "thus , in the present case too , co emission could have been expected .",
    "its absence indicates that it either is present but below detection levels or that it did not form for reasons which are not clearly understood .",
    "band spectra of v5579 sgr are shown at different epochs .",
    "the relative intensity is normalized to unity at 2.2 @xmath20,width=307,height=576 ]      as noted earlier , v5579 sgr showed pre - maximum brightening . after its discovery on 2008 april 18.784 ut by nishiyama & kabashima ( nakano 2008 ) at 8.4 mag , it brightened by nearly 1.8 mag over next five days to reach maximum of @xmath0 = 6.65 mag on 2008 april 23.541 ut . this pre - maximum rise is well observed at optical wavebands .",
    "our first near - ir photometric observations are available for 2008 april 23.988 ut close to the optical maximum .",
    "we have studied the fireball phase by obtaining spectral energy distribution ( sed ) covering the optical and near - ir region .",
    "the following optical magnitudes @xmath25=7.6 , @xmath0=6.87 , @xmath26=6.23 and @xmath27=5.55 at maximum brightness from aavso along with the present @xmath9 magnitudes of 2008 april 23.988 ut were used in deriving the sed .",
    "the observed magnitudes were corrected for extinction using koornneef s ( 1983 ) relations and @xmath17=2.23 mag . from a blackbody fit to the sed shown in top panel of fig .",
    "6 , we obtain a formal temperature of @xmath28 = 8900 @xmath10 400 k which is consistent with the a to f spectral type for the pseudo - photospheres displayed by novae at outburst ( gehrz 1988 ) .",
    "however , this temperature @xmath28 estimate is likely to have additional errors as all the observed flux values used in the fit lie on the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "further , the @xmath25 band flux value is also susceptible to significant errors since it has the largest interstellar extinction correction .",
    "the blackbody angular diameter @xmath29 in arcseconds is calculated using the relation given by ney @xmath15 hatfield ( 1978 ) , namely ,    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is in w @xmath32 and @xmath28 is in kelvin . from the model blackbody fit of 8900 k shown in fig . 6 ( upper panel ) , we find @xmath33 = 3.64 @xmath8 10@xmath34 w @xmath32 .",
    "we accordingly obtain a value of @xmath7 0.5 milliarcsec for the angular diameter .",
    "this value for the angular diameter can be used to estimate the distance to the nova by invoking constant expansion rate for the ejecta and the relation given by gehrz ( 2008 ) , namely ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is in kpc , @xmath37 in km s@xmath3 , @xmath38 in days since outburst began and @xmath29 in milliarcsec . taking a value of 1500 km s@xmath3 ,",
    "the typical fwhm of hi lines for @xmath37 and @xmath39 d corresponding to the epoch of optical maximum we get d = 17.3 kpc which is four times larger than the estimate done in section 3.1 using the mmrd relation . the reason for this discrepancy is not clear .",
    "a likely reason is that the pseudo photosphere behaves as a grey body with reduced emissivity in the fireball phase .",
    "the estimate of @xmath29 will always be a lower limit since it is applicable for a blackbody ( ney @xmath15 hatfield 1978 ; gehrz et al .",
    "1980 ) . for a grey body ,",
    "the observed angular size can be larger , since the right hand side of equation 1 should be divided by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 the emissivity has a value less than unity .",
    "a similar discrepancy was noticed by das et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the case of v1280 sco , where the blackbody angular diameters were smaller by a factor of three than the values derived from the interferometric measurements .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath38 is likely to have an error due to the uncertainty in the determination of the start of the outburst . for v5579 sgr ,",
    "yamaoka ( 2008 ) and liller ( 2008 ) report that no object brighter than 11.5 and 11.0 mag respectively was seen on their petrol images taken around 2008 april 15.743 ut and 2008 april 16.22 ut .",
    "thus our estimate of @xmath38 is likely to have an error of @xmath7 2 days which worsens slightly more the discrepancy between the distances determined using the mmrd and the blackbody angular diameter relations .",

    "we estimate a value of 1700 @xmath10 200 k for the temperature of the dust shell . however , this estimate of temperature for the dust shell has large uncertainty as observations in only three wavelengths are used in fitting the sed of which the dust is contributing mostly in the k band .",
    "russell et al ( 2008 ) have estimated the dust shell temperature to be 1370 k based on the observations spanning the wavelength range upto 5.2 @xmath5 m .",
    "the likely reason for the higher value for the dust temperature derived by us is the restricted spectral coverage extending upto k band only that may have emphasized the contribution at shorter wavelengths .    the mass of the dust shell can be calculated from the thermal component of the sed of 2008 may 14 ut shown in fig .",
    "woodward et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have given the expression for the mass of the dust shell as @xmath44 = 1.1 @xmath8 10@xmath45 @xmath33 @xmath46 / @xmath47 .",
    "in the expression above , mass of the dust shell @xmath44 is in units of @xmath48 , @xmath33 is in w @xmath32 measured at peak of the sed , the black - body temperature of the dust shell @xmath49 is in units of 10@xmath50 k , and the distance to the nova @xmath36 is in kpc .",
    "it is assumed that the dust is composed of carbon particles of size less than 1 @xmath5 m with a density of 2.25 gm @xmath51 .",
    "the early dust formation , high dust temperature and sed in the near - infrared that resembles black - body in the case of v5579 sgr are indicative of presence of carbon grains in the dust shell ( clayton @xmath15 wickramsinghe 1976 ) .",
    "in addition the occurrence of strong carbon spectral features in the observed spectra indicate that our assumption that the dust is made up of carbon / graphite is reasonable .",

    "1996 ) . taking a canonical value of 200 for the gas to dust ratio , we get @xmath7 4.2@xmath8 10@xmath57 @xmath48 for the gaseous component of the ejecta .",
    "this value is smaller than the typically observed value of 10@xmath58 to 10@xmath59 @xmath60 in novae .",
    "one definite reason for the dust mass being underestimated is that our sed is based on data extending upto only 2.2 @xmath61 m and certainly neglects contribution from dust emission at longer wavelengths . in this process",

    "( 2008 ) who get @xmath49 = 1370 k on 2008 may 9 , five days before the date being considered in this analysis , which further cools down quickly to 1070 k by 2008 may 22 ( rudy et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the formulation used for the dust mass estimate is very sensitive to @xmath49 .",
    "further , since the rudy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and russell et al .",
    "( 2008 ) reports show that the dust emission peaks at longer wavelengths , we are also underestimating @xmath33 .",
    "correct use of both @xmath49 and @xmath33 values should considerably enhance the dust mass estimate made here .",
    "we have alternatively explored the possibility of estimating the ejecta mass using recombination line analysis of hi .",
    "however , we find that the strengths of these lines , relative to each other , deviate considerably from case b values on all epochs indicating that the lines are optically thick .",
    "hence we are unable to estimate the ejecta mass from recombination analysis .",
    "we qualitatively discuss the p cygni profiles seen around maximum light as they can help estimate the radius of the white dwarf s ( wd ) photosphere ( @xmath62 ) at this epoch .",
    "kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) have shown from theoretical considerations of the photospheric optical depth that @xmath62 @xmath63 100 @xmath64 at maximum .",
    "this is a substantial increase by a factor of almost @xmath65 in the wd s radius between quiescence to maximum .",
    "subsequent refinements in their modeling of novae light curves reaffirm that after the thermonuclear runaway sets in on a mass - accreting wd , its envelope expands greatly to @xmath62@xmath63 100 @xmath66 ( hachisu & kato , 2001 ; hachisu & kato , 2006 ) the evolution of @xmath62 with time is illustrated diagrammatically in the above works .",
    "it is desirable to have observational confirmation for such estimates of @xmath62 and p cygni profiles may provide an assessment of this physical parameter .",
    "the generic formation of p cygni profiles , following lamers & cassinelli ( 1999 ) , can be understood by considering a spherical symmetric outflowing wind ( in our case the mass loss from the nova outburst ) in which the velocity necessarily increases outwards i.e. , the wind is accelerated outwards till it reaches a terminal velocity . to the outside observer , it is the matter in the form of a tube in front of the stellar disc which scatters light from the continuum of the star that is responsible for the absorption component of the p cygni profile ( see fig . 2.4 in lamers & cassinelli ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "the ratio of the strength of the emission and absorption components of the p cygni profile depends on the size @xmath67 of the wind region ( i.e. , size of the ejected material ) relative to the size of the star .",
    "if the star is large compared to the size of the wind region the emission will be smaller than the absorption .",
    "when the wind region is large compared to the star s size we expect emission to dominate - this can be seen geometrically as the volume of the emitting gas becomes much larger than the volume causing the absorption component .",
    "observationally consistent with this scenario , it is known that prominent p cygni profiles in a nova outburst are inevitably seen and reported at maximum light and on one or two days following it .",
    "at such an epoch , it is therefore reasonable to use an approximation that the wind region size @xmath67 is of the order of the stellar size @xmath62 .",
    "since the wind region size @xmath67 can be approximated kinematically ( @xmath67 @xmath7 @xmath68@xmath8@xmath38 , @xmath68= mean velocity of ejecta , @xmath38 = time after outburst ) , a qualitative estimate can be made of @xmath62 .",
    "this could be used as the rationale in estimating @xmath62 .",
    "as the ejected matter ( the wind region ) keeps expanding to larger sizes at later times following the maximum , the emission component strengthens and finally begins to dominate .",
    "this expected behaviour is reasonably in accordance with the early p cygni profiles seen in v5579 sgr as shown in fig .",
    "a simplistic order - of - magnitude estimate for @xmath62 may be obtained in the following way .",
    "let a typical velocity of @xmath68 @xmath7 1000 km s@xmath3 for the nova ejecta be assumed .",
    "velocities in nova ejecta can range from few hundreds to few thousands of km s@xmath3 and @xmath68 = 1000 km s@xmath3 is a fairly representative value . for our choice of @xmath68 , and taking @xmath38 = 1 d as the typical timescale when prominent p cygni profiles are generally seen , the value of @xmath67 @xmath7 120 @xmath66 encouragingly matches that expected for @xmath62 .",
    "however , we emphasize that this is purely a qualitative estimate .",
    "we hope to undertake a detailed modelling , which takes into account a realistic wind - velocity law in the ejecta , to try and reproduce observed p cygni profiles in novae and their evolution with time .",
    "we have presented near - infrared spectroscopy and photometry of nova v5579 sgr which erupted on 2008 april 19 . from the optical lightcurve , the distance to the nova",
    "is estimated to be @xmath69 @xmath10 0.2 kpc .",
    "the infrared spectra indicate that the nova is of the fe ii class .",
    "evidence is seen from the @xmath9 photometry and spectra for the formation of dust in the nova in mid - may 2008 . in this context , the presence of emission lines from low ionization species like na and mg in the early spectra and subsequent formation of the dust supports the predictive property of these lines as indicators of dust formation as proposed by das et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "it may be noted that v5579 sgr is one of the few fast feii class of novae ( @xmath12 = 8 d ) that formed dust .",
    "we have indicated the possible usefulness of the p cygni profiles seen in the novae spectra around maximum brightness to study the physical parameters related to the central white dwarf .",
    "the research work at physical research laboratory is funded by the department of space , government of india .",
