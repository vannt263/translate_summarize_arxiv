    "2006b ) , the situation becomes considerably more uncertain at redshift @xmath24 .",
    "this is because most of the techniques effective at low redshift rely upon light at wavelengths that simply can not be detected at high redshifts for all but the most exceptional sources .",
    "determinations of the sfr density from x - ray or radio emission appear to be just possible at @xmath1@xmath22 - 4 by stacking a large number of sources in very deep integrations ( e.g. , seibert et al .",
    "2002 ; nandra et al .",
    "2002 ; reddy & steidel 2004 ) , but do not work at @xmath26 ( lehmer et al .",
    "2005 ; carilli et al .",
    "similarly , while deep mid - ir data would seem to be quite effective in estimating the sfr at @xmath9 ( e.g. , reddy et al .  2006 ;",
    "caputi et al .",
    "2007 ) , at @xmath27 many of the key spectral features redshift to wavelengths not very amenable to study with current instrumentation .",
    "this leaves us with sparingly few techniques for estimating the sfr density at high redshift , most of which have only recently been developed .",
    "these techniques include traditional approaches like a consideration of the @xmath3 light to estimate the sfr densities to newer approaches that use gamma - ray burst ( grb ) rate densities ( e.g. , yksel et al .  2008 ;",
    "li 2008 ) or possible detections of redshifted h@xmath28 ( e.g. , chary et al .",
    "2005 ) to make these estimates .    perhaps , the simplest and most practical of these techniques is to rely on the @xmath3 light emanating from the high - redshift galaxies themselves .",
    "young stars emit a large fraction of their energy at these wavelengths , and it is very easy using current instrumentation to measure this energy to very low sfr rates ( i.e. , @xmath160.1 @xmath29 yr@xmath30 at z@xmath24 in the hubble ultra deep field [ hudf : beckwith et al .  2006 ] ) .",
    "one of the most significant challenges in establishing the sfr from the uv data is estimating the absorption by dust .",
    "since @xmath3 light is subject to substantial attenuation by dust , this entire issue is quite important .",
    "one of the most practical methods for determining the dust attenuation is through the @xmath3-continuum slopes @xmath0 ( @xmath31 ) . since",
    "these slopes have been shown to be well correlated with the dust extinction at @xmath14 ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 ; meurer et al .  1997",

    "not surprisingly , there have already been a number of attempts to determine these slopes at high redshift ( @xmath1@xmath22 - 6 ) from the available imaging data .",
    "adelberger & steidel ( 2000 ) and meurer et al .  ( 1999 ) examined the uv slopes for a sample of @xmath33 @xmath34-dropouts and inferred modest ( factor of @xmath165 ) dust extinctions .",
    "other groups ( lehnert & bremer 2003 ; ouchi et al .  2004",
    "; stanway et al .  2005 ;",
    "yan et al .  2005 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2006 ) have looked at these slopes at higher redshifts ( @xmath35 ) , again on a dropout selection .",
    "broadly , it was found that higher redshift galaxies had bluer @xmath3-continuum slopes than lower redshift galaxies have , suggesting that the typical dust extinction at high redshift is significantly less than it is at lower redshift .",
    "there was also some evidence from previous analyses ( e.g. , meurer et al .",
    "1999 at @xmath10 ) that lower luminosity galaxies had bluer @xmath3-continuum slopes @xmath0 and thus lower dust extinctions ( though the emphasis in meurer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) was the correlation between @xmath0 and the dust - corrected luminosity , not the observed luminosity ) .",
    "regrettably , apart from these two trends ( higher redshift galaxies are bluer and lower luminosity galaxies are bluer ) , it has been difficult to make quantitative statements about the distribution of @xmath3-continuum slopes or dust extinctions for galaxies at high redshift . in part , this can be attributed to the piecemeal way the @xmath3-continuum slopes and dust extinction have been derived at high redshift , as different analyses have derived @xmath3-continuum slopes based upon a wide variety of disparate high - redshift galaxy samples , using different techniques ( not all of which are consistent ) . in part , this can also be attributed to the limited amounts of data available to each particular study .",
    "fortunately , the situation has begun to change , and there is now a wide variety of hst data that are available to select high redshift galaxies and determine their slopes over a wide range in redshift and luminosity .",
    "determining how these slopes also depend upon luminosity seems particularly relevant given the fact that these sources likely dominate the @xmath3 luminosity density and perhaps star formation rate density at @xmath36 ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2006 ; sawicki & thompson 2006b ; bouwens et al .  2007 ; reddy et al .  2008",
    "; yan & windhorst 2004 ; reddy & steidel 2009 ) .",
    "it seems clear that a comprehensive , systematic determination of the distribution of @xmath3-continuum slopes is needed , both as a function of redshift and luminosity .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to provide just such an analysis , taking advantage of the considerable quantity of deep hst data to clarify our understanding of dust obscuration and , by consequence , the star formation rate density at high redshift .",
    "we select galaxies for @xmath3-continuum slope measurements over a wide range in redshift using well - tested @xmath10 @xmath34 , @xmath11 @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 , and @xmath7 @xmath40 dropout selections .",
    "we use the wide - area acs great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) fields ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004a ) to quantify these slopes at bright magnitudes and extend our analyses to very low luminosities by examining very deep hst data sets like the hudf , and also by examining dropouts behind massive galaxy clusters where the substantial magnification factors permit us to consider very faint sources .",
    "the plan for this manuscript is as follows . in  2 , we present the observational data set . in  3",
    ", we describe our procedure for generating source catalogs from these data , selecting the dropout samples , and estimating the @xmath3-continuum slopes while correcting for the effect of object selection and photometric scatter .",
    "finally , we discuss our results (  4 ) , examine the likely implications of these results for the effective dust extinction and sfr density at @xmath1@xmath22 - 6 (  5 ) , and then include a summary (  6 ) . throughout this work",
    ", we will find it convenient to quote results in terms of the luminosity @xmath4 steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) derived at @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath41 , for consistency with previous work  though we note that the steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) lf results are now updated ( @xmath42 : reddy & steidel 2009 ) but still consistent with the previous determination . where necessary , we assume @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . although these parameters are slightly different from those determined from the wmap five - year results ( dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ) , they allow for convenient comparison with other recent results expressed in a similar manner .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the @xmath3-continuum continuum slope @xmath0 presented here all assume a 1600-2300@xmath46baseline .",
    "we express all magnitudes in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "the purpose of this study is to measure the @xmath3-continuum slope over as wide a range in luminosity and redshift as is practical from current observations . of course , establishing this distribution even over a limited range in redshift or luminosity can be a challenge , as it requires very deep imaging over a wide wavelength range , both to select galaxies through the lyman break technique and to measure their uv - continuum slope redward of this break .",
    "it also requires sufficient search area to provide a sufficiently large samples of sources to effectively define the distribution of @xmath3-continuum slopes .    at @xmath10",
    ", we use the deep @xmath34-band coverage available over the wfpc2 hubble deep field ( hdf ) north ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) and hdf south ( casertano et al .",
    "2000 ) to select @xmath10 @xmath34-dropouts .",
    "those two deep wfpc2 fields are invaluable for defining the distribution of @xmath3-continuum slopes at lower luminosities , but their small area limits their value for establishing the distribution at the higher luminosities .",
    "however , as we will see , the @xmath3-continuum slope distribution for bright @xmath10 galaxies is similar to what adelberger & steidel ( 2000 ) and reddy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) derived previously .",
    "for our @xmath11 @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 , and @xmath7 @xmath40-dropout samples , we utilize the acs @xmath21 data available over the hudf , hudf05 ( oesch et al .  2007 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2007 ) , and goods fields .",
    "the wide - area goods fields are used for establishing the @xmath3-continuum slope distribution for luminous galaxies while the deeper hudf and hudf05 fields are used for establishing the @xmath3-continuum slope distribution for lower luminosity galaxies .",

    "we correct the observed distributions of @xmath3-continuum slopes @xmath0 for the effect of object selection and photometric scatter (  3.7 ) . finally , we discuss the uncertainties that likely exist in our determinations (  3.8 ) and then give our final estimates of the @xmath3-continuum slope distributions in  3.9 .",
    "we used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to perform object detection and photometry .",
    "object detection was performed using the square root of the @xmath54 images ( szalay et al .",

    "our procedure for measuring colors depends upon the psf of the data we are using . for colors that include only the acs or wfpc2 bands ( where the psf is much sharper than for nicmos ) , we measure these colors in scalable apertures determined using a kron ( 1980 ) factor of 1.2 .",
    "when measuring colors that include the nicmos near - ir bands , we first psf match the acs / wfpc2 data to the nicmos @xmath22-band .",

    "for example , for a source with @xmath3 colors measured across the baseline 1600@xmath46to 2300 , a 0.1 mag error in this color translates into an error of 0.3 in the estimated slope @xmath0 .    measuring colors to this level of accuracy is challenging for a number of reasons , particularly in the near - ir .",
    "first and foremost , the nicmos detector ( essential for measuring the fluxes of faint sources in the near - ir ) has been shown to suffer from significant non - linearity in its count rate . while there are now procedures ( e.g. , de jong et al .",
    "2006 ) to correct for these non - linearities , as utilized here , it is unlikely that the corrections are perfect in the magnitude range we are considering .",
    "this is because there are comparatively few deep fields available where the near - ir fluxes can be measured and calibrated against other data .",
    "secondly , the colors we are measuring are derived from both optical ( acs ) and near - ir ( nicmos ) data where the psf is very different .",
    "while such differences can be effectively addressed by carefully matching the psfs of the two data sets before measuring fluxes ( as we do here ) , psf matching can be challenging to perform perfectly and so it is easy to introduce small systematic errors at this stage .    as a result of these issues",
    ", we took great care in deriving correction factors that we could apply to the measured nicmos near - ir fluxes .",
    "for simplicity , we assumed that these correction factors did not depend on the luminosity of the sources we were considering  but rather were simple offsets we could add to the measured magnitudes .",
    "we established these correction factors by examining the photometry of a sample ( @xmath1650 ) of relatively faint ( @xmath87 ) point - like stars ( sextractor stellarity @xmath810.8 ) over the hudf / goods fields , and then compared their observed colors with that expected from the pickles et al .

    "here we describe our method for converting the rest - frame @xmath3 colors we measure for galaxies in our samples to their equivalent @xmath3-continuum slopes .",
    "we base these conversions on model seds ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) calibrated to have @xmath3-continuum slopes @xmath0 of @xmath902.2 , @xmath901.5 , and @xmath900.8 over the wavelength range @xmath161600@xmath46to @xmath162300@xmath46(to match the wavelength probed by the deep multiwavelength data available for our sample ) .",
    "the model seds assume a @xmath96 star formation history , @xmath97 myr , @xmath98 myr , @xmath99=-0.7 $ ] , and a salpeter imf with @xmath310 dust extinction of 0.0 , 0.15 , and 0.3 applied using the calzetti et al .",

    "we have calculated the color of these model seds as a function of redshift by integrating these seds across the filter sensitivity curves .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : colz ] as the solid red lines .",
    "we also have calculated the colors expected when the model sed has a perfect power law slope @xmath311 and cuts off at 912@xmath46(see black lines on figure  [ fig : colz ] ) .",
    "then , knowing the effective @xmath0 of the model seds and the observed colors of these seds at the mean redshift of our different dropout samples , we can derive a relation between the measured colors and the @xmath3-continuum slope .",
    "the derived relations are @xmath312 the mean redshifts assumed here for our @xmath34 , @xmath37 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 dropouts in deriving these relations are 2.5 , 3.8 , 5.0 , and 5.9 ( bouwens et al .  2004 ; bouwens et al .",

    "some galaxies are likely in the midst of starbursts when we observe them , while other galaxies have likely undergone bursts some time in the past and so would have slightly older stellar populations .",
    "this results in some degree of variation in the shape of the seds in our samples  which is above and beyond what we can parametrize using the model seds above , with a simple one - parameter variation in the overall dust extinction .    to show the extent to which the observed colors depend on the assumed star formation history , in figure  [ fig : colz ] we also show these colors for a relatively young stellar population ( with 30 myr of constant star formation ) and a somewhat older stellar population ( a model for which star formation proceeded at a constant rate for 100 myr and then ceased for 10 myr prior to observation ) .",
    "dust attenuation for these alternate star formation histories is varied so that the uv - continuum slope @xmath0 is alternatively @xmath122 , @xmath121 , and @xmath316 .",

    ".    we can attempt to use these model seds to estimate the approximate uncertainty in converting from the observed colors to @xmath3-continuum slope @xmath0 .",
    "assuming the high - redshift population is composed of an equal mix of the two alternate model seds and our fiducial model sed and averaging over redshift , we estimate an error @xmath133 of 0.02 , 0.10 , 0.02 , and 0.02 in the derived @xmath0 s at @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath38 , and @xmath7 ."
