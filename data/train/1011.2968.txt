    "the transformations corresponding to changes in these functions ought to be interpreted as gauge transformations , as explained in sec.ii.b of @xcite . from ( [ feve ] )",
    "it is clear that the action of a general such transformation on @xmath58 is [ dotfch ] = u^0()[f,_1()]_gp+w()[f,_2()]_gp)d^3x .",
    "the transformations corresponding to the change in @xmath36 are said to be generated by the constraint @xmath13 , whereas those following from the change in @xmath37 are generated by @xmath33 .",
    "imagine that @xmath59 and @xmath60 correspond to the dynamics obtained for the choice of arbitrary functions as @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 respectively .",
    "assume that @xmath63 at some instant @xmath64 .",
    "the difference @xmath65 corresponds to the unphysical gauge transformation . but",
    "how can this difference be calculated explicitly ? if @xmath66 and @xmath19 is analytic , then ( t_0+)=_n=1^f^(n)(t_0 ) , where @xmath67 denotes the @xmath68th time derivative of @xmath19 .",
    "up to first order in @xmath69 , this change can be easily evaluated by means of ( [ dotfch ] ) .",
    "but what if we wished to find a finite form of a gauge transformation ?",
    "the equations of motion in the form ( [ emqed ] ) are very helpful .",
    "first note that instead of using ( [ dotfch ] ) it is straightforward to obtain the variations of first derivatives of basic canonical fields directly from ( [ emqed ] ) . from now on",
    ", we will be interested in changes in the derivatives at @xmath70 but the argument @xmath64 will not be written explicitly .",
    "so for example @xmath71 for @xmath19 being any canonical variable , but @xmath72 will not vanish in general .",
    "specifically , from ( [ emqed ] ) it follows that = u^0,_j=-_jw,^0=^j=0,=iew ,=- iew ,=- iew,=iew . to obtain variations of higher derivatives , differentiate each side of ( [ emqed ] )",
    ". then the second time derivatives will be expressed by the fields and their first derivatives , whose variations are already known .",
    "variation of the resulting system leads to _ 0=^0,_j=_j(u^0- ) , , = -ie(u^0-)-e^2(w)^2 + 2iew , , ^j=0 ( variations of the derivatives of the remaining fields can be found by conjugations and application of the constraints ) .",
    "note that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not infinitesimal and therefore some care is required in calculating the variations .",
    "one should simply calculate the difference , e.g. @xmath75 , so that the terms proportional to the higher powers of @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not omitted .",
    "the variations of higher derivatives can be found by continuation of this iteration procedure .",
    "the tylor series that emerges can by shrunk to [ gauge ]    & a_0(t,)=_t(t , ) , a_j(t,)=_j(t,)+(t , ) ) , ( t,)=(e^-ie((t,)+(t,))-1)(t , ) , + & ( t,):=_t_0^t dt_t_0^t dt  u^0(t,),(t,):=-_t_0^t dtw(t , ) .    the transformation of @xmath47 can be found from ( [ emqed]b ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath76 .",
    "hence , it is @xmath77 , and not @xmath78 , which is gauge invariant and hence can be interpreted as a measurable physical electric field @xmath79 .",
    "if this interpretation is assumed than the equations of motion that follow from the extended formalism , when expressed in terms of measurable quantities @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 are precisely the maxwell equations ( note that from ( [ gauge ] ) it follows that @xmath83 is indeed gauge invariant ) .",
    "now that we have all the gauge freedom explicitly described , we should proceed to quantize the theory .",
    "since the only second class constraints are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the generalized dirac bracket is given simply by the formula ( iii.23 ) of @xcite , although the generalized poisson bracket is now given by ( [ gpbqed ] ) .",
    "if gdb s are promoted to the commutators of the operators in the quantum theory , the second class constraints can be consistently interpreted as strong operator equalities .",
    "were there no first class constraints , we could try to quantize the theory in much the same way as we did for the free dirac field in @xcite .",
    "but the first class constraints are the obstacle .",
    "they can not be interpreted as strong operator equations , since their gdb s with other dynamical variables do not vanish in general .",
    "one method of implementation of these constraints in the quantum theory is to demand that the _ physical hilbert space _ of physical quantum states is a subset of a larger _ kinematical hilbert space _ defined by the condition @xmath84 , where @xmath85 enumerates all the first class constraints .",
    "this method was originally proposed by dirac @xcite and gave rise to the brst quantization .",
    "however , i shall use a different method , which allows the computation of physically measurable quantities most quickly .",
    "this is the fixed gauge quantization . in this approach",
    ", one simply adds another constraint to the theory , called _ gauge condition _ , which results in all the constraints being second class at the end .",
    "a gauge condition is any relation between the @xmath86 s and the @xmath87 s of the form [ gengaugecon ] ( q , p)0 which is accessible , i.e. any point @xmath88 can be transformed by gauge transformation to the one that satisfies ( [ gengaugecon ] ) .",
    "also , we wish that the gauge condition , after being inserted to the consistency algorithm together with other constraints , eliminate all the gauge freedom . otherwise , we need to impose farther gauge conditions or use the dirac quantization anyway .",
    "a shall consider the simplest condition , which is the coulomb gauge [ coulomb ] = _ i a^i 0 .",
    "this is clearily accessible by the transformation ( [ gauge ] ) , since for any @xmath89 one can construct @xmath90 , @xmath91 that satisfies @xmath92 .",
    "one only needs to take f(t,)=-d^3 . to see this , use the identity [ identity ] -_= _",
    ")=4 ^ 3(- ) .",
    "let us now step back to the point of the analysis in which the primary constraints were just found , eq .",
    "( [ primaryqed ] ) .",
    "we shall now add the gauge condition ( [ coulomb ] ) to the set of primary constraints ( the reader is encouraged to find out that the results would not alter if @xmath34 was interpreted as a secondary constraint ) .",
    "hence , the primary constraints and the total hamiltonian are now [ primarycoul ] & _ 1=-^0,_2=+^0,_1=^0,=_ja^j , + & h_t = h+u^0()_1()+_1()u^1()+ u^2()_2()+u ( ) ( ) ) , d^3x , where @xmath18 is still given by ( [ h ] ) . now that the set of primary constraints and @xmath22 have changed , it is necessary to rerun the consistency algorithm for the time evolution of constraints . as before ,",
    "the bracket of @xmath44 with @xmath22 gives the constraint @xmath21 and requiring the brackets of @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath22 to vanish leads to the restrictions on @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( [ u1u2 ] ) .",
    "however , calculation of the bracket of @xmath34 with @xmath22 results in a new constraint _",
    "gp=[_j a^j , h_t]_gp=-_j=-_j^j - a_0=:0 .",
    "so , in the first run of imposing consistency conditions the two secondary constraints @xmath21 and @xmath93 were found and the restrictions ( [ u1u2 ] ) on @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "continuing with the algorithm for @xmath21 and @xmath93 one gets    & [ _ 2,h_t]_gp =- e+_j_j u0 , + & [ , h_t]_gp = e_j^j)+_j_j ( u - u^0 ) .",
    "if ( [ u1u2 ] ) is used ( which is allowed ) , the first equation gives the restriction on @xmath94 u=0 .",
    "the second equation than gives u^0=e_j^j ) .",
    "hence , no farther constraints were produced and the consistency algorithm is now finished . instead of @xmath95 the constraint @xmath96 can be used , as before .",
    "the commutation relations of the constraints are now the following : @xmath44 commutes with everything but @xmath93 _ gp=(- ) .",
    "@xmath33 commutes with everything but @xmath34 _ gp=-(- ) . @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "commute with all the other constraints and the bracket of @xmath26 with @xmath27 is the same as before .",
    "finally , the bracket of @xmath34 with @xmath93 is _",
    "gp=-(- ) . hence , all the constraints are now second class , as desired .",
    "it is straightforward to check that these constraints do not hide any first class ones , i.e. it is impossible to construct a first class constraint from a linear combination of them .      before calculating the gdb , it is useful to rearrange slightly and rename the constraints . in the following",
    "i shall use & _ 1=-^0,_2=+^0 , + & _ 3_2=_j^j+ie(-),_4=_ja^j , + & _ 5_1=^0,_6=+_2=ie(-)-a_0 .",
    "hence , instead of @xmath93 i will now use @xmath97 .",
    "this is because now the constraints can be grouped into pairs @xmath98 ; @xmath99 ; @xmath100 ; such that the constraints in a given pair have vanishing brackets with those in the remaining pairs .",
    "the matrix @xmath101 will then acquire a block  diagonal form , which facilitates the calculation of its inverse .",
    "explicitly , the non  vanishing brackets are & c_1l,2k:=[_1l,_2k]_gp = i^0_kl(-)=c_2k,1l , + & c_3,4:=[_3,_4]_gp=-(-)=-c_4,3=-c_4,3 , + & c_5,6:=[_5,_6]_gp=(-)=-c_6,5=-c_6,5 .",
    "the inverse matrices to these blocks are then [ blockinv ] & c^1l,2k = c^2k,1l =- i^0_lk(- ) , + & c^3,4=-+a_34 , c^4,3=+a_43 , + & c^5,6=+a_56 , c^6,5=-+a_65 . here",
    "@xmath102 are completely arbitrary numbers",
    ". it may be surprising that the inverse matrices are not determined in a unique way and that they even do not inherit the symmetries of the matrices to which they are inverse .",
    "this is because these are infinite  dimensional matrices to which standard theorems of linear algebra do not apply .",
    "that the results ( [ blockinv ] ) are correct for arbitrary values of the constants @xmath102 can be verified by direct computations , e.g. d^3y c^3,4c_4,3= -d^3y(-)+a_34d^3y(-)=-_)=(- ) .",
    "that the term proportional to @xmath103 vanishes follows from the following reasoning : imagine that the area of integration is a bounded open subset of @xmath104 such that @xmath105 .",
    "then the application of gauss theorem ( which is assumed to hold for distributions ) allows to rewrite the integral of @xmath106 as a flux of the gradient @xmath107 through the boundary @xmath108 .",
    "but the dirac delta and its derivatives vanish everywhere except the points in which their argument is zero .",
    "hence , the integration of @xmath107 with respect to @xmath109 over the region that does not contain @xmath110 ( such as @xmath108 ) must necessarily give zero .",
    "now for any @xmath111 one can find @xmath112 and decompose the integral over @xmath113 into the one over @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the integral over the complement of @xmath114 vanishes , since there the argument of @xmath116 is always nonzero .",
    "this completes the argument .",
    "so , the arbitrary constants appeared in the inverse matrix @xmath117 .",
    "will then the gdb also include them ?",
    "the answer is no ! recall that the the purpose for the particular construction of gdb was to enable consistent replacement of the brackets by the commutators or anti  commutators of operators , dependently on whether the variables are even or odd . in order for this to be possible",
    ", the gdb was required to posses appropriate symmetries .",
    "this symmetries will not be satisfied if the inverse matrix ( [ blockinv ] ) is used in the construction , unless a_33=a_44=a_55=a_66=0,a_43=-a_34,a_65=-a_56 .",
    "so the freedom in the construction of the gdb is now reduced to the two parameters @xmath103 and @xmath118 . the partially solved formula for the gdb that is convenient for performing farther calculations is then [ gdbcoul ] & [ f , g]_gd=[f , g]_gp+i_kkd^3x [f,_1k]_gp[_2k,g]_gp+[f,_2k]_gp[_1k , g]_gp ) + & + d^3xd^3y  -a_34 )  [ g,_2()]_gp-[f,_2()]_gp ) + & + d^3xd^3y  + a_56 )  [ g,_6()]_gp-[f,_6()]_gp ) .",
    "however , another requirement for the gdb was that it is consistent with all the second class constraints .",
    "it appears that there is a problem with ( [ gdbcoul ] ) with this respect . to see this ,",
    "take @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath29 is arbitrary function that does not depend on the canonical fields .",
    "it follows from ( [ gdbcoul ] ) that [ a0g1 ] [ a_0(),g]_gd = ied^3x+a_56 ) ( ) ( ) .",
    "but the constraint @xmath121 tells us that @xmath122 , which , under the physically reasonable assumption that @xmath48 is bounded everywhere , can be integrated to yield [ a0 ] a_0()=d^3z+a _ , where the constant @xmath123 does not contribute anything to the brackets and fact could be set to zero without any loss of generality in the subsequent analysis .",
    "if ( [ a0 ] ) is used , the calculation of the bracket now gives [ a0g2 ] [ a_0(),g]_gd = ie ( ) ( ) .",
    "clearly , ( [ a0g1 ] ) agrees with ( [ a0g2 ] ) if and only if @xmath124 ! this is a strange result , since the bracket ( [ gdbcoul ] ) of any dynamical variable with any of the constraints @xmath125 ,",
    "@xmath126 can be verified to vanish for arbitrary values of @xmath103 and @xmath118 .",
    "so it seams that it is consistent with the constraints !",
    "the point is that in obtaining ( [ a0 ] ) i did not use the constraint @xmath121 but its integrated version _",
    "6():==ied^3x+a_0()-a _ .",
    "the bracket ( [ gdbcoul ] ) of a dynamical variable with this integrated constraint does not vanish in general , unless @xmath124 .",
    "but how it can be that the bracket with @xmath121 vanishes but the bracket with the integral of @xmath121 does not ?",
    "does this fact contradict the linearity of the bracket ?",
    "this apparent paradox can be traced back to the following calculation ( certainly incorrect ) [ paradox ] 0=d^3x(-)=d^3xd^3y .",
    "[ pomparad ] the first equality stems from the fact that for any @xmath127 we have @xmath128 ( use gauss theorem ) . that the result is wrong can be seen by substituting = + )(- ) into the rhs of ( [ paradox ] ) .",
    "then the integral of the first component of ( [ pomparad ] ) vanishes , since this component is the divergence of a vector field that vanishes everywhere except the point @xmath129 .",
    "the integral of the second component of ( [ pomparad ] ) gives @xmath130 , since this component is just equal to @xmath131 , on account of ( [ identity ] ) .",
    "hence , we finally obtain from ( [ paradox ] ) that @xmath132 , which seems incorrect .",

    "a requirement of consistency of gauge conditions with time evolution needs to be imposed and it may lead to additional constraints .",
    "if all the gauge freedom is eliminated , the remaining constraints are all second class and should be incorporated in the construction of gdb .",
    "then , in order to pass to quantum theory , one should in principle seek for representation of the final commutation relations of important fields with respect to gdb in a hilbert space .",
    "all these steps were performed for the case of electrodynamics with fermions .",
    "the causal structure of space ",
    "time was not employed and , indeed , all these steps can still be performed if the electromagnetic interaction is replaced or supplemented by gravity .",
    "however , even in the case of electrodynamics , the resulting commutation relations appeared to be rather complicated and no obvious way of representing them in a hilbert space was visible . in the simplest case of the free dirac field , considered in the first article @xcite , it was possible to find explicit solution to the field equations .",
    "if the fields are constructed in such a way that they satisfy field equations automatically , then one does not need to bother about representing of their commutation relations with the hamiltonian .",
    "what is more , the remaining commutation conditions between the functions that parametrize the exact solutions were sufficiently simple that the representation could be found for them . on the contrary , in the presence of electrodynamics the equations are to complicated to be solved explicitly .",
    "it is a way out of this problem in the case of electrodynamics , since the hamiltonian decouples into the free and interaction part , the latter being proportional to a very small fine structure constant .",
    "this allows for the transition to the interaction picture , in which the equations and commutation relations are sufficiently simple .",
    "then the perturbative quantization can be applied . in the case of gravity , no such obvious decoupling , which would lead to",
    "the simple interaction  picture equations , seems to be possible . on the other hand ,",
    "the non  perturbative field equations are even more complicated then those of electrodynamics and hence the attempts to represent them , without any simplifications , in a hilbert space seems hopeless .",
    "certainly , one can decouple the metric tensor to the minkowski part and the deviation , which is commonly done , and quantize only the deviation .",
    "then the interaction picture can be obtained , but the background independence is sacrificed and the resulting theory is non  renormalizable . hence , these problems are serious , and the lack of poincar invariance in the presence of gravity is certainly not an important obstacle .",
