    "stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) undergo substantial mass - loss through cool , low - velocity winds ( @xmath310  ) .",
    "these winds are one of the dominant means through which chemically enriched material is recycled back into the galaxy to sustain new generations of star and planet formation ( e.g. , schrder & sedlmayr 2001 ; cristallo et al . 2009 ; leitner & kravtsov 2011 ) .",
    "the distribution of circumstellar debris on the largest scales may also be important for the subsequent evolution of novae , planetary nebulae and some type  ia supernovae ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2004 ; mohamed & podsiadlowski 2007 ; wareing et al . 2007a ; chiotellis et al . 2012 ; roy et al .",
    "in addition , the outflows and space motions of these mass - losing stars play a role in shaping the structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) on parsec and sub - parsec scales ( villaver et al . 2002 ; wareing et al . 2007b ; begum et al . 2010 ) .",
    "it has long been recognized that the interstellar environment of evolved stars can have a profound impact on the observed mass , size , shape , and chemical composition of their circumstellar envelopes ( hereafter cses ; e.g. , smith 1976 ; isaacman 1979 ; young et al . 1993b ; villaver et al . 2002 , 2012 ; wareing et al . 2006 ; 2007a , b , c ; wareing 2012 ; see also the review by stencel 2009 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the interfaces through which agb stars interact with their environments have remained poorly studied observationally .",
    "one problem is that cses can be enormously extended ( @xmath41  pc ) , and their chemical compositions change as a function of distance from the star as densities drop , and molecules become dissociated by the interstellar radiation field or other radiation sources .",
    "the result is that some of the most frequently used observational tracers of cses ( e.g. , co ; sio , h@xmath5o , and oh masers ) do not probe the outermost cse or its interaction zone with the ism . in some cases ,",
    "more extended material can be traced via imaging observations in the far - infrared ( fir ; e.g. , young et al .",
    "1993a , b ; zijlstra & weinberger 2002 ; ueta et al . 2006 , 2010 ; cox et al .",
    "2012a ) or in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ; martin et al . 2007 ; sahai & chronopoulos 2010 ) , but such data do not supply any direct kinematic information .",
    "recent studies have demonstrated that the  21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is a powerful tool for the study of extended cses and their interface with their larger - scale environments ( e.g. , grard & le  bertre 2006 ; matthews & reid 2007 ; libert et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , 2010a , b ; matthews et al . 2008 , 2011a , b , 2012 ; grard et al . 2011a , b ) . not only is hydrogen the most plentiful constituent of cses , but  line measurements provide valuable kinematic information and can be directly translated into measurements of atomic hydrogen mass .",
    "furthermore , because  is not destroyed by the interstellar radiation field ,  measurements are particularly well - suited to probing the outermost reaches of cses .    while the number of evolved stars detected in the  line has grown steadily over the past decade thanks to ongoing surveys with the nanay radio telescope ( nrt ; le  bertre & grard 2001 , 2004 ; grard & le bertre 2003 ; grard & le  bertre 2006 ; gardan et al .",
    "2006 ; libert et al .",
    "2008 , 2010a ; grard et al . 2011a , b )",
    ", the number of stars that has been imaged in  with aperture synthesis arrays has remained small ( bowers & knapp 1987 , 1988 ; matthews & reid 2007 ; matthews et al . 2008 , 2011b , 2012 ; le  bertre et al . 2012 ) . such imaging observations offer a crucial complement to single - dish measurements , since the high angular resolution of interferometers provides detailed information on the structure and spatially resolved kinematics of the cse and enables detailed comparisons with observations of the cse at other wavelengths .",
    "in addition , interferometers act as effective filters against large - scale galactic contamination along the line - of - sight , allowing stellar signals to be more readily disentangled from background radiation .",
    "in this paper we present new  imaging observations of eight mass - losing agb stars , effectively doubling the existing sample .",
    "we describe in detail the results for each individual star , followed by a discussion of emerging trends from the combined sample of evolved stars that has been imaged in  to date .",
    "the targets for the present study of circumstellar comprise a set of eight galactic agb stars spanning a range in properties , including effective temperature , mass - loss rate , variability class , and chemistry .",
    "some basic parameters of the sample are summarized in table  1 .",
    "none of the stars in our current program is a known or suspected binary , although two binary agb stars , r  aqr and mira , have been observed in  as part of our earlier studies ( matthews & reid 2007 ; matthews et al .",
    "2008 ) .",

    "in addition , the wealth of additional detail revealed by our imaging data provides important new clues on the evolutionary history of the star and its interaction with the local environment .",
    "to first order , the morphological properties of the  emission surrounding rx  lep appear to be significantly influenced by the interaction between the star and its local interstellar environment .",
    "this is not surprising given the moderately high space velocity of the star ( @xmath11357  ; table  5 ) .",
    "manifestations of this interaction include the elongation of its  shell , the displacement of the star from the center of this shell , and the extended tail of gas trailing to the south .",

    "the north - south elongation of rx  lep s egg - shaped shell aligns roughly with the space motion vector that we have computed for the star ( pa@xmath132 ) .",
    "this small misalignment between the two may be due to a bulk ism flow in the region , directed roughly perpendicular to the trajectory of the star .",
    "evidence for similar local flows has recently been inferred from observations of other evolved stars ( ueta 2008 ; ueta et al .",

    "if we adopt half of the fwhm linewidth of the spectral profile as a measure of the outflow velocity ( i.e. , @xmath133  ) and a mean shell radius of 0.15  pc , the dynamical crossing time for the shell is @xmath256,000  yr . if rx  lep has traveled from the shell center to its present position in this amount of time , its implied rate of motion in declination would be only @xmath20.5  mas yr@xmath89significantly less than its _ hipparcos _ proper motion along this direction ( 56.93  mas yr@xmath89 ) .",
    "this implies that the  shell is not `` free - floating '' , but rather that it is being dragged along with the moving star .",
    "furthermore , this suggests that the displacement of the star from the shell center originates primarily from the lower pressure encountered in the direction opposite the motion of the star compared with in the leading direction .    as described below ,",
    "our new data support the possibility that rx  lep has only recently begun a new phase of mass - loss . if true , this may help to explain another prominent feature of its shell : the dearth of emission along its equatorial region .",
    "villaver et al . (",
    "2012 ) point out that for mass - losing stars moving supersonically through the ism , an ensuing pressure drop interior to an existing shell that occurs in - between mass - loss episodes may trigger instabilities , leading it to break apart .",
    "villaver et al . also note that as the wind from a new mass loss episode propagates through previously ejected material , shock regions are expected to develop .",
    "we speculate that the break in rx  lep s shell may be linked with such shocks or instabilities .",
    "extended gaseous wakes resembling cometary - like tails have now been detected in   emission toward several agb stars , trailing their motions through space ( matthews & reid 2007 ; matthews et al .",
    "2008 , 2011b ; see also  [ txpsc ] ) . however , none of the tails discovered to date has been as highly collimated as the one seen trailing rx  lep .",
    "it is likely that this narrow tail results from the confluence of the relatively early evolutionary status of rx  lep compared with other stars imaged in  to date , coupled with its relatively high space velocity and the star s location near the galactic disk ( see table  5 ) . in general , higher stellar space velocities allow more efficient deflection of mass loss debris behind the star to form a trailing wake ( e.g. , villaver et al . 2012 ) , while higher local ism densities ( as are expected near the galactic plane ) produce greater external pressure , leading to greater collimation ( e.g. , wareing 2012 ) .",
    "we note however that in simulations , the adopted cooling function and the temperature assumed for the stellar wind will also influence the resulting properties of the cometary tail .",

    "details are described in appendix  a. we recognize that our model is an oversimplification , since it assumes spherical symmetry and does not account for the space motion of rx  lep .",
    "the stellar motion will result in a higher effective pressure on the leading edge of its  shell and a pressure in the trailing direction that is lower than the average ism pressure .",
    "these effects will impart an elongation to the  shell ( as well as a reduction of the size of the shell in the leading direction ) and lead to the formation of a trailing wake . despite these limitations ,",
    "our model is able to provide a satisfactory fit to the globally averaged  line profile of rx  lep ( figure  [ fig : models]a ) and supplies a first order estimate of the duration of mass loss time history for this star .",

    "[ fig : yumacmaps ] one sees that the emission giving rise to the broader of the two  line components in figure  [ fig : yumaspectrum ] arises from spatially compact emission lying at or near the position of the star , while the narrower velocity component comes from material that is more spatially extended .",

    "conversely , we see that there is little or no fir emission underlying the northwestern portion of the  nebula , including the ridge of enhanced  column density and the weaker plume extending from the northern edge . since in principle , whatever process is responsible for the distortion on the northwestern side of the cse and creation of the `` plume '' observed in   should have acted on both the  and the fir - emitting ( presumably dusty ) material , this suggests that either the atomic hydrogen is intrinsically more extended than the dust or that dust grains were destroyed during this process .",

    "multiple emission peaks are present near the stellar position , but again the peak emission in each channel is offset to the southwest of the star , with a relative dearth of emission at the stellar position itself .",

    "this map confirms that the peak  column density toward r  peg does not coincide with the stellar position , but instead lies at a projected distance of @xmath149 ( 0.1  pc ) southeast of the star .    a global  spectrum of r  peg is shown in figure  [ fig : rpegspectrum ] .",
    "there are hints of a slight asymmetry in the line profile , as well as a line peak that is broader and flatter than the other stars in the current sample .",
    "nonetheless , a single gaussian ( dotted line on figure  [ fig : rpegspectrum ] ) provides a reasonable fit to the data for the purpose of characterizing the global line parameters .",

    "the direction of this offset is within @xmath176 of position angle of the space velocity vector that we have computed for the star ( pa@xmath177 ; table  5 ) , suggesting that one possible explanation is that there is an accumulation of material in front of the star caused by the `` snowplow effect '' ( isaacman 1979 ) . in this picture",
    ", the gas to the northwest of the star could comprise a trailing wake of material , ram pressure - stripped through the interaction between the cse and the local ism ( see  [ rxlepdisc ] ) .",
    "consistent with this hypothesis , over the velocity channels spanning 25.1  to 22.5  , the emission in the putative wake shows a systematic increase in projected distance from r  peg with decreasing lsr velocity , as would be expected for debris that is being slowly decelerated by dynamical friction from the local ism ( see matthews et al .",
    "2008 , 2011b ; raga & cant 2008 ) .",
    "a related possibility is that the lobes of emission near the star are the remnants of a wake of debris shed during a previous cycle of mass - loss , and that the material has since drifted relative to the stellar position .",
    "this could also help to explain the small blueshift of the  line centroid relative to the systemic velocity determined from molecular line observations visible in figure  [ fig : rpegspectrum ] .",
    "however , an ism flow originating from a northerly direction would seem to be required to account for the direction of the offset between the star and the  emission , as well as the curving sides of the horseshoe , which are oriented roughly perpendicular to the direction of the stellar space motion .    despite the bifurcated appearance of the emission in several of the  channel maps ( figure  [ fig : rpegcmaps ] ) , we consider the possibility that the  surrounding r  peg results from some type of bipolar outflow to be unlikely . while bipolar flows are known in the case of a number of agb stars , with the exception of the high - velocity flows ( @xmath2100  ) arising from certain known or suspected binaries ( imai et al .",

    "further , in the case of r  peg , the two `` lobes '' would have to be oriented close to the plane of the sky to account for their similar radial velocities .",
    "finally , the asymmetry of the velocity - integrated emission relative to the stellar position and the elongation of the emission parallel to the space motion vector ( figure  [ fig : rpegmom0 ] ) are both effects expected as a result of interaction between the ejecta of a moving star and the surrounding ism .",

    "tx  psc was previously observed in  by grard & le  bertre ( 2006 ) .",
    "its cse was clearly detected , although the blue edge of the line profile suffered from confusion .",
    "grard & le  bertre found evidence that the  emission associated with tx  psc is quite extended , with a radius of @xmath134 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the 60@xmath107 m radius of @xmath265 reported by young et al .",
    "( 1993a ) based on _ iras _ data . similarly , based on higher resolution _ herschel _",
    "70@xmath107 m data , jorissen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found a source with a total extent of roughly @xmath266 ( as estimated from their figure  6 ) , which includes a broad , low surface brightness trail of emission extending toward the northeast .",
    "geise ( 2011 ) measured a slightly larger angular extent ( @xmath2@xmath223 ) from a _",
    "70@xmath107 m image .",
    "examination of  survey spectra from kalberla et al .",
    "( 2003 ) toward the direction of tx  psc reveals that there is a line component with peak brightness temperature @xmath22  k centered near @xmath10210  , very near the systemic velocity of tx  psc .",
    "this emission is too strong to be plausibly associated with the cse of tx  psc , and instead is likely to be interstellar in origin .",
    "this emission reveals its presence in our vla maps as the positive and negative banding seen in our channel images from @xmath267 to 11.1  ( figure  [ fig : txpsccmaps ] ) implying that it is extended over scales of @xmath268 ( the maximum angular scales that can be sampled with the vla in d configuration ) .",
    "the presence of this additional emission component so close in projected position and velocity to tx  psc suggests that the amount of extended emission in the cse may have been overestimated from the nrt observations .",
    "indeed , the  mass for the cse of tx  psc derived from the nrt data is nearly five times larger than we derive from the vla . while we can not rule out that the  wake of tx  psc may include a low surface brightness extension that can not be readily detected with the vla ( analogous to the one confirmed by the nrt toward mira ; see matthews et al .",
    "2008 ) , our vla maps suggest that confusion may preclude a definitive test of this possibility .",
    "a systemic decrease in the radial velocity of gas in extended circumstellar wakes parallel to the direction of motion is expected as a consequence of the gradual deceleration of the wake material owing to its interaction with the ism ( e.g. , wareing et al .",
    "2007c ; raga & cant 2008 ) .",
    "indeed , such gradients have been detected in the extended wakes of mira ( matthews et al .",
    "2008 ) and x  her ( matthews et al .",
    "in the case of tx  psc , we likewise see evidence for a systematic blueshifting of the `` tail '' gas with increasing distance from the star in the  channel maps ( figure  [ fig : txpsccmaps ] ) and  velocity field ( figure  [ fig : txpscmom1 ] ) .",
    "the gradient is maximized along a position angle of @xmath269 and has a magnitude of @xmath21 - 2  projected in the plane of the sky .",
    "while in principle , quantifying the velocity gradient along a gaseous wake provides a means of age - dating the stellar mass loss history ( matthews et al .",
    "2008 , 2011b ; raga & cant 2008 ) , our ability to do this for tx  psc is compromised by the presence of a second prominent velocity gradient _ perpendicular _ to the direction of space motion of the star .",
    "the magnitude of this gradient ( projected in the plane of the sky ) is @xmath24.5  across the width of the  envelope ( @xmath270 or 0.48  pc ) .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure  [ fig : txpscpv ] , where we show a position - velocity cut across the emission .",
    "this perpendicular velocity gradient appears to be real and not an artifact caused by unresolved large - scale structure or its sidelobes in our maps .",
    "the most compelling evidence of this is that the velocity gradient persists even at velocities that are uncontaminated by confusion ( @xmath271  ) .",
    "it also persists if we impose @xmath221-@xmath139 restrictions on the data during imaging in order to suppress the short spacings ( @xmath272 ) that give rise to the spurious large - scale structure in the images .",
    "unfortunately , such @xmath221-@xmath139 restrictions also suppress much of the large - scale emission that appears to be genuinely associated with tx  psc .    for the semi - regular variable x  her , matthews et al .",
    "( 2011b ) also reported evidence of a velocity gradient orthogonal to the direction of space motion in their  data .",
    "in the x  her case , this orthogonal axis corresponds to the symmetry axis of a bipolar outflow previously detected at smaller radii through molecular line observations .",
    "matthews et al .",
    "suggested that the  may therefore be tracing an extension of this outflow out beyond the molecular dissociation radius .",
    "might a similar situation apply to the case of tx  psc ?",
    "tx  psc has no published molecular line imaging observations , so it is unknown whether the star has an axisymmetric molecular outflow .",
    "single - dish mapping by heske et al .",
    "( 1989 ) revealed hints of deviations from spherical symmetry , and the co profile published by heske ( 1990 ) shows a two component line structure , which is frequently a hallmark of stars with bipolar outflows ( e.g. , kahane & jura 1996 ; bergman et al .",
    "2000 ; josselin et al .",
    "2000 ; libert et al .",
    "2010b ) . the co mapping data of heske et al .",
    "also show evidence for a spatial offset between the blue and red portions of the line emission along a position angle roughly parallel to the direction of space motion of the star . however , this velocity shift has the opposite sign to the gradient seen in the  along this direction ( i.e. , with blueshifted co emission peaking to the southwest and redshifted co emission to the northeast).-axis labeling create an ambiguity . ]",
    "another significant problem with this explanation for the velocity gradient transverse to the tx  psc wake is that the velocity gradient appears to persist well beyond the vicinity of the star , where the gas should be dominated by a turbulent flow of ram pressure stripped material , not the stellar outflow .",
    "an alternative explanation for the velocity gradient orthogonal to its  wake is the influence of a transverse flow in the local ism .",
    "evidence for local transverse flows has now been seen in the neighborhood of several other evolved stars ( e.g. , ueta et al .",
    "2008 ; ferguson & ueta 2010 ; ueta et al .",
    "2010 ; see also  [ rxlepdisc ] ) , although the origin of these flows remains unclear . in the case of tx",
    "psc , such a transverse flow could also offer a natural explanation for the offset in position angle between the observed  wake and the derived space motion vector in figure  [ fig : txpscmom0 ] .",
    "we can attempt to quantify the magnitude and direction of a local ism flow following the procedure outlined in ueta et al .",
    "wilkin ( 1996 ) derived an analytic expression that relates the shape of a bow shock surface to its standoff distance , @xmath273 :    @xmath274    where @xmath275 is the angular displacement from the bow shock apex as measured from the position of the star , and :    @xmath276    here @xmath277 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath278 is the  number density of the local ism , and @xmath107 is the mean molecular weight of the gas ( assumed to be 1.3 ) .",
    "@xmath273 effectively defines the locus of ram pressure balance between the internal pressure of the cse surrounding a mass - losing star and the ram pressure exerted by the ism due to the star s supersonic space motion .",

    "inverting equation  2 and using the fitted @xmath273 value together with @xmath106 and @xmath166 from table  1 , one may then derive the peculiar space velocity of the star with respect to its local ism : @xmath281  .    adopting the position angle and inclination of the bow shock from cox et al .",

    "while the true value of @xmath278 is uncertain , the nominal value predicts a position angle for the flow that corresponds precisely to the direction of the vertical velocity gradient across the tx  psc envelope ( figure  [ fig : txpscpv ] ) .",
    "it thus seems quite plausible that the velocity gradient across the tx  psc shell results from a transverse ism flow rather than outflow from the star itself .",
    "the direction of the observed velocity gradient is also consistent with this interpretation .",

    "these shells are seen around both oxygen - rich and carbon - rich stars , and appear to have a different origin from the thin detached molecular shells seen around some carbon stars .",
    "all four  shell stars have similar mass - loss rates [ @xmath330  yr@xmath89 ] and low - to - moderate space velocities , but otherwise show a range in properties , including chemistries , wind outflow velocities , and variability classes .",
    "all of the shells have a clumpy rather than smooth structure , and none of the observed  shells are spherical ; they range from egg - shaped ( rx  lep ) to boxy ( y  cvn ) to amorphous ( y  uma and v1942  sgr ) . in the case of y",
    "uma , there is evidence that one edge of the shell was distorted through its interaction with the local ism .",
    "the shell of rx  lep exhibits a pronounced elongation along the direction of space motion of the star , as well as a `` cracked egg '' morphology , with a dearth of emission along its equatorial region .    based on simple numerical models",
    "we have estimated ages for the four shells in the range @xmath309 to @xmath310  yr ( appendix  a ) .",
    "these results support previous suggestions that rx  lep is in a relative early evolutionary state compared with the other three stars . for the carbon stars",
    "y  cvn and v1942  sgr the derived ages also imply that mass loss time scales previously derived from fir measurements have been underestimated by a factor of @xmath27 .    for both y  uma and y  cvn ,",
    "high - resolution fir images are available that reveal counterparts of the -emitting shells . in both cases ,",
    "the extent of the fir shell is comparable to that of the  shell , but the two tracers show notable differences , perhaps due to effects such as ionization of the  from shocks or local destruction of dust grains .",
    "both y  uma and y  cvn also exhibit `` notch''-like depressions in their  and fir intensity along the leading edge of their  shells and running parallel to their direction of space motion .",
    "these notches may be signatures of instabilities along the leading edge of the cse .",
    "while the  shells of y  uma and y  cvn are similar in terms of their sizes , morphologies , and line widths , the y  uma shell contains only half the  mass as that of y  cvn and also shows a distinct rotationally symmetric pattern in its  velocity field whose origin is unclear .",
    "the two highest velocity stars in our study ( rx  lep and tx  psc ) were found to have extended gaseous wakes trailing the motions of the stars through the galaxy .",
    "such wakes are formed by the effects of ram pressure on the circumstellar ejecta as the stars move supersonically through the ism .",
    "the wake of rx  lep ( which stretches @xmath20.36  pc ) is more highly collimated than any  wake detected to date , a fact that is likely due to a combination of the relatively early evolutionary status of the star on the tp - agb and the high density of its interstellar surroundings . for tx  psc",
    ", the orientation of the wake ( which stretches @xmath331  pc ) appears to be affected by a local transverse flow in the ism .",
    "this flow could also explain a velocity gradient observed across the cse , perpendicular to the direction of space motion .",
    "we find the oxygen - rich mira r  peg to be surrounded by a peculiar `` horseshoe''-shaped  nebula that extends over @xmath21.7  pc on the sky .",
    "this morphology may result in part from the effects of local ism flows .",
    "however , the cse morphology close to the stellar position is also peculiar , with two asymmetric lobes of emission stretching roughly parallel to the direction of space motion of the star .",
    "these lobes differ from the head - tail structures seen toward other stars in that the `` head '' of the nebula lies at a projected distance of @xmath20.1  pc southeast of the star .",
    "one possible explanation is that the observed  structures are the vestiges of an earlier cycle of mass - loss .",
    "the two undetected stars in the present sample ( ik  tau and afgl  3099 ) are both relatively cool mira variables with high mass - loss rates [ @xmath332  yr@xmath89 ] .",
    "both stars were also undetected in previous single - dish studies .",
    "for these stars , hydrogen in the circumstellar environment may be too cold to detect via 21-cm line emission or may be largely in molecular form .",
    "ldm acknowledges support for this work from grant ast-1009644 from the national science foundation .",
    "mcj was supported through a national science foundation research experience for undergraduates grant to mit haystack observatory .",
    "the observations presented here were part of nrao programs am887 and am1001 and archival program ak237 .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "as a mass - losing star becomes progressively surrounded by an expanding shell of circumstellar material , the collision of the supersonic stellar wind with the surrounding medium ( local ism and/or debris from earlier episode of mass loss ) produces a slowly expanding shell of denser material ( lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "young et al . ( 1993b ) developed a model to simulate the formation of these `` detached shells '' as seen in infrared emission , and libert et al .",
    "( 2007 ) subsequently adapted this type of modeling to circumstellar hydrogen .    in this picture , a detached shell results from a stellar outflow that is abruptly slowed down at a termination shock .",
    "this first shock defines the inner boundary of the detached shell ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the outer limit ( @xmath333 ) is defined by the leading edge ( bow shock ) where external matter is compressed by the expanding shell ( see figure  5 of libert et al .",
    "2007 ) . between these two limits ,",
    "the detached shell is composed of compressed circumstellar and interstellar matter separated by a contact discontinuity at a radius @xmath334 .",
    "the circumstellar matter is decelerated and heated when crossing the shock at @xmath135 .",
    "as it cools from a temperature @xmath335 ( at @xmath135 ) to @xmath336 ( at @xmath334 ) , the expansion velocity decreases , from @xmath337 to @xmath338 , and the density increases from @xmath339 to @xmath340 . adopting an arbitrary temperature profile",
    ", one can numerically solve the equation of motion between @xmath135 and @xmath334 .",
    "here we have applied a similar method to modeling the  shells of rx  lep , y  uma , y  cvn , and v1942  sgr .",
    "models for three of the stars ( rx  lep , y  cvn , and v1942  sgr ) have previously been published based on single - dish  observations ( libert et al . 2007 , 2008 , 2010a ) , but our new imaging observations provided improved constraints on the model parameters .    we have not attempted to compute models for either tx  psc or r  peg . in the case of tx  psc , the relative high space velocity and large fraction of the circumstellar ejecta present in its extended trailing wake makes it a poor candidate for a stationary and spherically symmetric model . for r  peg , the complex  morphology and line shape also imply that a simple model fit of the type described here is unlikely to be meaningful .    following libert et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the temperature profile in the detached shell of the four modeled stars is constrained by the observed  line profile .",
    "for the external part of the detached shell ( between @xmath334 and @xmath333 ) , we assume a density profile that falls off as @xmath341 , with the condition that the total mass ( @xmath342 ) is given by the equivalent ism mass enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath333 . inside @xmath135 , we assume a spherical wind in uniform expansion , whose properties ( mass - loss rate , outflow velocity , and systemic velocity ) match those derived from co observations ( table  1 ) .",
    "we assume mass lost from the star comprises 90% h atoms and 10% he atoms by number ( glassgold & huggins 1983 ) . the outer radius of the shell , @xmath334 , is constrained by the vla images .    based on our models , the detached shell is expected to produce a narrow , quasi - gaussian emission peak at or near the stellar systemic velocity in the spatially integrated spectrum , while the freely expanding wind should produce a weaker , broader line component with peaks located on either side of the stellar systemic velocity , near @xmath343 ( see le  bertre et al .",
    "in general , the shell component dominates the global spectral profile .",
    "our best - fit parameters for the four stars that we have modeled are summarized in table  a1 , and model fits are overplotted on the observed spectra in figure  [ fig : models ] . in all cases , our toy model provides a reasonable fit to the strength and width of the global  line profile .    for the present study ,",
    "the most useful outcome of our models is an estimate for the age of each of the shells , which can be obtained from a sum of the parameters @xmath344 and @xmath345 in table  a1 .",
    "not surprisingly , we find the smallest age ( @xmath290,000  yr ) for rx  lep , a star that is believed to be in the early stages of the tp - agb ( see  [ rxlep ] ) . for the other three stars ,",
    "our models imply that the  data are tracing more than @xmath346 years of stellar mass loss history . in the case of y",
    "uma , our derived shell age is comparable to the age of the fir - emitting shell previously derived by young et al .",
    "1993b ( @xmath347  yr ) , while in the cases of the carbon stars y  cvn and v1942  sgr , our new values are 6.8 and 6.6 times larger , respectively .    to obtain a more complete picture of these four stars",
    ", future models will ultimately need to take into account the motion of the stars through the ism and the resulting distortions that this produces on the  shells",
    ". however , this will require sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations that are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "furthermore , we note that our model fits break down at small radii ( @xmath348 ) , systematically predicting more flux than is observed in both the shell component ( central peak ) of the line profile and the freely expanding wind ( `` horns '' )",
    ". this may be due to an uncertainty in the temperature profile adopted in our models , short - term fluctuations in the mass - loss rate , asymmetric or non - spherical mass loss , and/or a breakdown in our assumption that the wind is largely atomic as it leaves the star .",
    "these possibilities will be investigated in a future work .",
    "fortunately the ages that we derive for the detached shells ( table  a1 ) depend mostly on their large - scale properties and are relatively insensitive to these details .",
