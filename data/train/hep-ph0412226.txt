    "@xmath0 exotic mesons have been identified for several years . in 1997 ,",
    "a group at bnl first claimed an isopin vector meson @xmath3 with quantum number @xmath0 in the channel @xmath5@xcite .",
    "this state has been confirmed further by ves and cbar@xcite .",
    "it could be identified as a hybrid at first sight . however , all theoretical calculations show it seems not in the case .",
    "the lattice qcd and the flux tube model predict the @xmath0 mass is around 1.9gev@xcite@xcite , which is much heavier than the @xmath3 .",
    "qcd sum rule also predicts it should be larger than 1.6gev@xcite . besides",
    ", the decays of the @xmath0 hybrid have also been studied in the context of various model@xcite@xcite , and also appear to be in disagreement with the experimental data of the @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , the flux model predicts the @xmath0 hybrid dominantly decays into @xmath6 and @xmath7 and qcd sum rule s calculation shows ( although differs from that of the flux model ) @xmath6 and @xmath1 are the hybrid s dominant decay channels .",
    "most recently , klempt gave a stronger argument based on the su(3 ) flavor symmetry to rule out the posibility that the @xmath3 could be a hybrid@xcite . because the @xmath3 is seen in the channel @xmath2 but not @xmath8",
    ", the @xmath3 must be a member of the su(3 ) decuplet .",
    "therefore , it could not be a @xmath9 hybrid .",
    "an arugment is given by close that the lowest @xmath0 four quark state should be in the combination @xmath10 , such as @xmath11 or @xmath12 , because they are in s - wave@xcite .",
    "however , both of them are heavier than the @xmath3 and consequently can not be seen in the @xmath3 decay .",
    "although @xmath2 and @xmath1 are in p - wave , the combinations @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 belong to the same order of orbital excitation for a four quark system .",
    "their masses should not be quite different .",
    "@xmath2 is already seen in the @xmath3 decay .",
    "but why not for @xmath1 ?",
    "actually , when @xmath14 does not appear in bnl s reaction @xmath15 , some authors conclude that the @xmath0 @xmath3 might not be exist@xcite .",
    "klempt s answer is that in the t - channel there is no @xmath16 exchange .",
    "that means the @xmath3 couples @xmath1 very weakly .",
    "then how about the @xmath4 ? which is another @xmath0 state seen in the @xmath1 channel and a little bit heavier than the @xmath3@xcite .",
    "is the @xmath4 the same as the @xmath3 ?",
    "if yes , it contradicts to klempt s statement . if no , how to explain the two states with the same quantum number and only 70@xmath17 mass interval",
    "?    in order to investigate this problem , we calculate the masses of the @xmath0 four states which decay dominantly into @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively from qcd sum rule approach .",
    "we find the direct instanton effect plays an important role .",
    "the direct instanton effect is very large in the sum rules of the state @xmath2 while it is proportional to the light quark mass square for the case @xmath1 .",
    "this might hint the different structure of states @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the predicted masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both 1.4 - 1.5 gev , which is close to the experimental candidates @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the main task for the @xmath0 mass prediction in the qcd sum rule approach is to calculate the current - current correlator @xmath18    where the interpolated current @xmath19 has the quantum number @xmath0 . in this paper , we just forcus on @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these two states are only seen in the channel @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "they look like molecule states . we need to construct the @xmath0 four quark currents with such property , for instance , @xmath22 for the @xmath2 state ( where @xmath23 is the isospin matrix and @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 for the @xmath1 state .",
    "we can not find a dimension six @xmath0 current for the @xmath1 state .",
    "but @xmath26 indeed annihilates a @xmath0 @xmath1 state .",
    "these currents do not exactly represent the molecule states .",
    "for instance , @xmath27 can both easily decay into @xmath28 and @xmath11 if its mass permits .",
    "we can not avoid such property , but other channles , such as @xmath29 and @xmath1 , is indeed suppressed in @xmath27 s decay .    use the standard operator - product expansion ( ope ) method@xcite , we get ( up to irrelevant polynomials in @xmath30 ) @xmath31.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is euler s constant and we will use @xmath33",
    "we also have ignored the two - quark condensate since it always accompanys with the mass of light quark , thus it is less importmant compare with these gluon condensate . in the correlator of the current @xmath26 , the leading order four quark condensate and the three gluon condensate vanish .",
    "the next leading order four quark condensate is very important .",
    "this situation is similar to that of the meson @xmath16 .    in order to preform qcd sum rules for the @xmath0 four quark states , we also should know something about the meson spectral density .",
    "usually the spectral density @xmath34 is defined via the standard dispersion relation @xmath35 where the @xmath36 are appropriate subtraction constants to render eq.[eq : dis ] finite .",
    "after borel transforming the spectral density , we get the sum rule : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and the quantity @xmath39 represents the qcd prediction , and the threshold @xmath40 separates the contribution from higher excited states and the qcd continuum .    in the single narrow resonance scenario , the lowest - lying resonance mass can be obtained from ratios @xmath41    thus we can use eq.[eq : sumrule ] to predict the mass of the @xmath0 four quark state .",
    "sum rules for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 states , where @xmath42 .",
    "( the solid lines correspond to the sum rules for @xmath2 while the dashed lines the sum rules for the @xmath1 ) ]    the various qcd parameters that will be used in the phenomenological analysis of eq.[eq : sumrule ] are @xmath43    in fig.[fig : sr1 ] , we show the mass of @xmath0 four quark state refered to the borel parameter @xmath44 .    the sum rules of the @xmath2 state are not stable(at small bore parameter the spectrum density is negative ) and the predicted mass of the @xmath2 is heavier than that of the @xmath1 .",
    "this is contradictory to the experiments about the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 .",
    "this problem arises because we have not taken the direct instanton effect into account yet . in history ,",
    "qcd sum rules based on ope gave a good description of vector mesons , such as @xmath16 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and so on , but failed in scalar or pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "it was found later that the direct instanton effect is large in the scalar(pseudoscalar ) channel but little in the vector channel .",
    "however , this statement is only valid in the quark anti - quark system . for a four quark system",
    ", we can see the direct instanton effect could be also very important in the vector channel .",
    "the calculation of the direct instanton effect is via the so - called zero mode(@xmath47 ) , which is a classical solution of the dirac equation ( given by @xmath48 t hooft ) in the background field of instantons:@xmath49 .    expanding the quark propagator in the background field of instanton for small quark mass ,",
    "we get @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the propagator of a scalar quark .    the first term of the expansion is known as the zero mode part of the propagator in the instanton field , which reads @xmath52 \\phi(x - z ) \\phi(y - z),\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "now let us consider the case of the current @xmath27 .",
    "the leading contributions of non - zero mode have already obtained in eq.[eq : nzm ] . from eq.[eq : full ] we know that the zero mode part is the dominating part of the full propagator since for light quark , @xmath55 is very small .",
    "so eq.[eq : nzm ] is not a complete correlation function .",
    "we need several new diagrams which include zero mode contribution .    zero mode contribution figure ( i ) .",
    "( the bigger blob denotes the pseudo - vector vertex @xmath56 , while the smaller one is the pseudo - scalar vertex @xmath57 .",
    "the dashed lines mean zero mode propagator .",
    "the coordinates of the left two vertices are zero while the right ones x. ) , height=113 ]    first we must include fig.[fig : zeromode ] , in which the pseudo - scalar loop receives zero mode contributions . in the single instanton approximation ,",
    "the result is @xmath58 ^ 4},\\ ] ] where the effective mass is @xmath59 according to the mean field estimate@xcite .",
    "this function is well defined .",
    "it vanishes as @xmath60 goes to infinity , meanwhile it is finite when @xmath60 goes to zero . in order to simplify our calculation",
    ", we expand this function about the point @xmath61 and only preserve the leading order , that is , we only preserve the constant term . combining with the pseudo - vector loop contribution , we finally get the zero mode contribution for fig.[fig : zeromode ] .",
    "the pseudo - vector loop does not received contribution of zero modes , though it does received a contribution from the interference between the zero mode part and the lead mass correction , we ignore it either since the effect is not very importmant .",
    "zero mode contribution figure ( ii).,height=188 ]    besides fig.[fig : zeromode ] , there are still several diagrams , showing in fig.[fig : zeromode2 ] , which also receive zero mode contribution . the contribution of fig.[fig : zeromode2 ] must be doubled since the arrows of the fermion lines have two direction .    after combining all contribution of fig.[fig : zeromode ] and [ fig : zeromode2 ] , we finally get : @xmath62 where all zero mode contributions preserve to leading order .    combinging eq.[eq : nzm ] and eq.[eq : zeromode ] and using the new parameters @xmath63 we finally get fig.[fig : sr2 ] , which show the mass of the resonance is 1.4 - 1.5 gev .",
    "sum rules for the @xmath2 includes zeromode contributions , where @xmath42 . ]    because the zero mode flips helicity of the quark , if all vertices of the current are vector type , the direct instanton effect via the zero mode is proportional to the light quark mass ( or higher power ) , because it needs the quark mass to flip helicity .",
    "therefore for the second current , the direct instanton contribution from the zero mode is proportional to the light quark mass square .",
    "we neglect it .",
    "after taking account of the direct instanton contribution , we find a dramatic result that the sum rules for the @xmath2 become quite stable . from the fig.[fig : sr2 ] , we read the mass of the @xmath2 is around 1.4 - 1.5 gev . because the correlator of the current @xmath26 does not get a big direct instanton contribution , the mass of @xmath1 is still 1.4 - 1.5gev .",
    "the mass of the @xmath2 is slightly lighter than that of the @xmath1 .",
    "this is quite consistent with the experimental data of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the different impact of the direct instanton contribution on the correlators of @xmath27 and @xmath26 probably hints the different sturcture of states @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "one might think the difference of the direct instanton contribution is compensated by the difference of the four quark condensate , because they have the same dimension .",
    "but we also note that the sign of the four dimension gluonic condensate of these two correlators is opposite .",
    "all of these hints the mixing between the @xmath2 and @xmath1 might be small",
    ". this result should not be quite surprising . in our opinion , because a four quark system has much more degree of freedom than a two quark system , the spectrum of the four quark system should be more crowded .",
    "this has already been comfirmed in the ref.@xcite , where the authors find there are several four quark states with the same quantum number and some of them are almost degenerate .",
    "besides , we need to mention that we only consider the two flavor case . if we include @xmath64 quark , the mass prediction could be slightly different .",
    "for instance , it is nature that the state @xmath8 might be 200 - 300mev heavier .",
    "however , such calculation is more complicated .",
    "besides , our calculation assumes the states have the molecule structure .",
    "if states have the different structure , such as the diquark structure , the prediction probably is different .",
    "we will discuss such cases in another paper .",
