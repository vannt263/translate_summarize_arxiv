    "the discovery of the higgs boson ( @xmath0 ) , whose mass is 125 gev , at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) run - i  @xcite and subsequent measurements of properties of the higgs boson  @xcite have established the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics as a low energy effective theory at the electroweak scale .",
    "nevertheless , the details of the higgs sector including the shape of the higgs potential are still unknown .",
    "the higgs sector of the sm with one isospin doublet scalar field is constructed based merely on minimality , and not guided by any fundamental principle .",
    "many models with extended higgs sectors can also satisfy current experimental data , and need to be distinguished in the future .",
    "in addition to the ambiguity of the higgs potential , several phenomena that require physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) have been reported .",
    "these include baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau )  @xcite , the existence of dark matter , cosmic inflation and neutrino oscillations .",
    "therefore , we are obliged to construct models of bsm to tackle such problems .",
    "it should be noticed that many bsm models predict different classes of the higgs sector from the viewpoint of the number of higgs multiplets and imposed symmetries .",
    "moreover , the essence of the higgs boson is directly connected to a bsm paradigm such as supersymmetry ( susy ) , dynamical symmetry breaking , classical scale invariance ( csi ) .",
    "therefore , hints of new physics can be obtained by exploring the properties of the higgs sector .",
    "one of the prominent examples of new physics accessible through probing the higgs potential is electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg )  @xcite .",
    "successful scenarios of ewbg require strongly first order phase transition ( 1stopt ) for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . with the mass of the discovered higgs boson being @xmath1 ,",
    "strongly 1stopt can not occur in the framework of the sm higgs sector .",
    "however , by extending the higgs sector with additional scalar fields , strongly 1stopt can be easily realized  @xcite . in order to unveil the mechanism of ewbg",
    ", one needs to identify the shape of the higgs potential and the dynamics of the ewsb .",
    "it is known that the condition for the 1stopt for ewsb leads to the deviation in the triple higgs boson coupling ( the @xmath2 coupling ) , which is typically larger than @xmath3 in renormalizable extended higgs sectors  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the deviation in the @xmath2 coupling and the 1stopt due to dimension - six operator in the higgs sector have been discussed in refs .",
    "one method to investigate such strong 1stopt is to measure the @xmath2 coupling at future high - energy electron - positron colliders .",
    "it seems to be challenging to measure the @xmath2 coupling with such an accuracy even at the high luminosity lhc .",
    "once the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite is realized , the @xmath2 coupling can be measured with @xmath3 accuracy at the upgraded version with @xmath4  @xcite . the compact linear collider ( clic )",
    "@xcite is also expected to be capable of testing the @xmath2 coupling at the similar accuracy , while the measurement of the @xmath2 coupling is beyond the scope of the future circular collider of electrons and positrons ( fcc - ee )  @xcite due to the lack of its center - of - mass energy . at future hadron colliders with the collision energy to be 100  tev , the similar accuracy to the ilc",
    "may be expected for the measurement of the @xmath2 coupling as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an alternative method to approach ewbg is observation of the stochastic gravitational waves ( gws ) produced by strongly first order electroweak phase transition ( ewpt )  @xcite . on february 11th , 2016 ,",
    "the first direct detection of gws emitted by the merger of black holes at advanced ligo was reported  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the ground - based experiments , kagra  @xcite , advanced ligo  @xcite and advanced virgo  @xcite will soon observe many gw signals from binary systems of neutron stars or black holes .",
    "thereby we have entered the new era of gw astronomy : physical phenomena can be probed through the observations of gws . although the main target of the above ground - based experiments is gws from astronomical phenomena , future space - based experiments such as elisa  @xcite , decigo  @xcite and bbo  @xcite have the sensitivity to investigate some cosmological phenomena including strongly 1stopts and cosmic inflation at the early universe .",

    "gw spectra from the strongly first order ewpt triggered by non - decoupling effects of new particles have been investigated in models with extended scalar sectors  @xcite , and supersymmetric models  @xcite . in the case of the minimal susy sm ( mssm )",
    ", the required strongly 1stopt can not be realized according to negative results of stop searches at the lhc .",

    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss complementarity between measurements of the @xmath2 coupling and the spectrum of gws in testing the strongly 1stopt of the electroweak symmetry in models with additional isospin singlet scalar fields with and without csi .",
    "we demonstrate that the combination of the measurements of the @xmath2 coupling at future electron - positron colliders and gws at the space - based interferometers can probe physics behind the ewsb . as an example",
    ", we consider a set of viable csi models with additional scalar fields where the ewsb is directly caused by thermal loop effects .",
    "the idea of csi has been originally introduced by bardeen as a paradigm to avoid the hierarchy problem  @xcite . in the csi models , utilizing the mechanism by coleman and weinberg  @xcite , a mass scale is generated through the dimensional transmutation although any parameter with mass dimension is not introduced in the original lagrangian .",
    "based on csi , many phenomenological models for ewsb have been proposed and investigated  @xcite .",
    "such a class of csi models can survive current experimental tests , and have the following unique features : a general upper bound on the lightest scalar boson is obtained ; the deviation in the higgs - photon - photon coupling is almost fixed by the number of charged scalar bosons ; and the deviation in the @xmath2 coupling is universally as large as @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "these csi models also predict strongly 1stopt for ewpt .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the spectrum of gws from the ewpt strongly depends on the number of extra fields and their masses , and is useful in revealing the higgs potential and underlying physics .",
    "we emphasize that the combination of future measurements of the @xmath2 coupling and stochastic gw signals would be a powerful tool in distinguishing the extended higgs sectors .",
    "for concreteness , we focus on the csi models where @xmath6 extra isospin singlet scalars obey a global @xmath7 symmetry , and discuss how these models can be differentiated from similar extended models by means of the measurements of the @xmath2 coupling and the gw spectrum .",

    "in this paper , we consider the following two types of @xmath7 scalar models as viable examples of strongly 1stopt , and compare both of them .",
    "one is the models where additional isospin singlet scalar fields are added to the sm higgs sector with the mass square term which is supposed to be negative for ewsb . the @xmath2 coupling and the spectrum of gws have been discussed in these models in ref .",

    "then , the deviation in the @xmath2 coupling is defined by coupling , there is a case where the deficit caused by the top loop contribution obtained through the effective potential method is compensated  @xcite .",

    "<S> we discuss complementarity of both the methods in testing the strongly first order phase transition of the electroweak symmetry in models with additional isospin singlet scalar fields with and without classical scale invariance . </S>",
    "<S> we find that they are synergetic in identifying specific models of electroweak symmetry breaking in more details . </S>"
