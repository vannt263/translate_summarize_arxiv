    "while information spread is a main effect in the worldwide social network , the actual mechanics of this process is especially hard to analyze , as noted among others by liben - nowell and kleinberg  @xcite .",
    "online social networks are widely used for information network analysis  @xcite . while many online social services exist , it is hard to find data sets that reveal detailed temporal records of the network growth .",
    "the concept of _ growth _ is a blend of two mechanisms that can be hardly separated .",
    "first , information networks grow naturally by newly established connections between individuals .",
    "second , one can view the growth as a network discovery process .",
    "interactions of users observed via information flow partly reveal the hidden social network of them .",
    "we study the growth of information networks by considering processes where each node and edge is added to the network only once , and no node or edge is deleted from the network .",
    "our key finding is related to how the average degree and the power - law degree distribution of the network evolves over time .",
    "more specifically ,    the exponent of the power - law degree distribution in the network _ decreases down to two _ over time , and    the average degree grows as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes in the network .",
    "for example , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : barabasi - vs - real ] , in graphs generated by the barabsi - albert model @xcite , the degree distribution exponent stays very close to constant .",
    "the starting point of our observations is that in a real network , the degree distribution log - log plot lines get flattened as the networks grow .",
    "we emphasize the importance of the constant @xmath2 in the average degree formula .",
    "the constant was considered negligible in the experiments of leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite . in our results",
    ", however , the constant helps capture the mixture of edges that appear at random vs.  as a result of common interest , and fit to the actual measurements as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : leskovec ] .    to our best knowledge",
    ", there is no graph model yet that captures both effects simultaneously .",

    "@xcite observe densification , a power - law growth for the average degree .",
    "their models apply to graphs where the exponent of the degree distribution is less than 2 and remains constant over time .",
    "they predict densification for networks with power law exponent larger than 2 that is the case for all of our real networks , however they give no models .",
    "our exponential growth and preferential attachment based model results in networks with initially slowly growing average degree in addition to decreasing power law exponent .",
    "the main difference of our model compared to earlier models can be summarized in three points .",
    "the power law exponent , as in all our real networks , is greater than 2 that could not be modeled in @xcite .",
    "our model explains the initial behavior of the degrees as a natural mixture of influence and preferential attachment edges , also correctly predicting the ratio of these edges .",

    "then certain rule such as preferential attachment  @xcite intensifies during the growth process , and causes scale - free degree distribution with a decreasing exponent .",
    "the stronger the rule is , the closer the exponent of the degree distribution gets down to two in a more coherent network . as the degree distribution log - log plot flattens , the chance for very high degree nodes in a strongly skewed distribution increases that usually act as the main organizer of the network structure .",
    "the intermediate stage in the life of a growing network is illustrated in figure  [ fig : viz_oc ] , with the number of nodes around 1,000 .",
    "one can observe several disconnected random edges and some larger components with high degree nodes that have already started evolving their internal structure . as our main result , we aim to model the transition from a random and mostly disconnected graph to a highly organized and very skew degree distribution network .",
    "all data sets used in our measurements are available in an anonymized format at our website .",
    "measurements covered in the next sections are further detailed and illustrated with more figures in jupyter notebooks that are available in our github repository .",
    "information spread in social networks like twitter or facebook have been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "several properties of these networks are widely considered to be approximately distributed as power law , with a few exceptions found in @xcite .",
    "newman reviews the theoretical background of power law functions and distributions found in empirical data sets in @xcite .",
    "we rely on these calculations in section  [ sec : es - meas ] , where we estimate the exponent of several power - law degree distributions .    a large number of models describing growing networks operate by assuming a constant average degree .",
    "for instance , the model of barabsi et al .",
    "@xcite is capable of generating networks with power - law distributions , but the average degree of the network remains fixed during the growth of the network .",
    "another model that assumes constant average degree is the popular copying model  @xcite .",
    "however , several measurements from the past report that the average degree of a growing network increases over time @xcite . some state that the average degree is a _ power - law _ function of the number of nodes .",
    "this effect has been named _ accelerated growth _ by dorogovtsev et al .",
    "@xcite , and _ densification law _ by leskovec et al .",
    ".    * densification laws . * leskovec et al .",
    "@xcite mention that the larger the exponent of the densification law , the denser the network over the growing process .",
    "they demonstrate densification law on six different networks , and introduce the community guided attachment model and the forest fire model .",
    "they claim that both can lead to densification law , and give a theoretical explanation for community guided attachment .",
    "related to our work , they derive a formula connecting the exponent of densification law and the exponent of the power - law degree distribution of the network .",
    "their model works if both the degree and the densification exponents are constant over time .",
    "they actually predict that if the degree distribution exponent is fixed and larger than 2 , then there is no densification and the average degree remains constant .",
    "they observe that for degree distribution exponents larger than 2 and changing over time , densification is possible in the network , however they give no models in this case .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we find that the increasing average degree is not a simple power - law function of the network size",
    ". we connect this growth to the decreasing power - law degree distribution exponent .",
    "we propose models that reproduce both increasing average degree and decreasing power law exponent in evolving networks .",

    "* in  @xcite , the notion of `` accelerated growth '' for power - law degree distribution with increasing average degree is introduced .",
    "similar to leskovec et al .",
    ", their formulas connect the exponent of the degree distribution and the accelerated growth exponent .",
    "the main difference is that they predict densification for networks with fixed degree distribution exponents above 2 as well .",
    "however , in contrast to our key observation , the exponent of the power - law degree distribution remains fixed in all models proposed in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find a different growth for the average degree and connect this to the decreasing power law exponent .    another work of dorogovtsev et al .",
    "is a growing network model in  @xcite .",
    "the concept of the model is that while random users continuously connect to the network , edges appear at constant @xmath3 rate between already existing nodes via preferential attachment .",
    "the model results in a network with power - law degree distribution where the exponent can be derived from the only model parameter @xmath3 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a similar model has been analyzed by barabsi et al .",
    "@xcite , and by chung in  @xcite .",
    "note that while the model leads to different degree distribution exponents for different values of @xmath3 , for a given growth process @xmath3 is always fixed in the cited works and the degree distribution remains the same .",
    "* models of vzquez . * in contrast to densification law and accelerated growth , in @xcite the average degree is measured to increase as a _ logarithmic function _ in the network size .",
    "vzquez investigates network models that generate power - law degree distributions with various exponents and introduces the triangle closing model .",
    "this dynamic model has only one parameter @xmath4 , and at each time step ( i ) with probability @xmath5 we add a new node to the network and connect it to one uniform randomly chosen previous node , and ( ii ) with probability @xmath4 we close a possible , previously not existing triangle in the graph .",
    "an in - depth analysis of the model can be found in  @xcite , where the author claims that the process results in a network with power - law degree distribution and the exponent of the distribution depends on the model parameter @xmath4 .",
    "while the model is capable of generating networks with various degree distribution exponents , in a fixed parameter setting , the exponent of the distribution remains constant over time .    * random edge sampling by pedarsani et al .",
    "* they question densification law in @xcite and state that densification can be a result of the fact that measurements on networks are usually carried out on edges sampled from an underlying fixed network .",
    "in other words , they conclude that densification may arise as a feature of the common edge sampling procedure to measure dynamic networks .",
    "they show that network growth can be a direct consequence of the sampling process , therefore the sampling process itself is a plausible explanation of network densification law . in section",
    "[ sec : edge - swap ] we introduce a simple experiment indicating that the growth of the average degree can not be explained by random edge sampling .",
    "we simply shuffle our time series that contains timestamped information about the growth of the network .",
    "we notice that the uniform shuffling procedure yields significantly different average degrees at different sizes of the network .",
    "* vertex copying models .",
    "* another popular model that is capable of generating power - law degree distributions is the vertex copying model .",
    "here at each time step we add a new node that chooses an ambassador node uniform randomly .",
    "next , we copy each of the connections of the ambassador node to the new node with probability @xmath6 , or attach a new edge to the new node uniform at random with probability @xmath7 .",
    "the model leads to a power - law degree distribution with exponent @xmath8 . similarly to the models of dorogovtsev et al .  and vzquez",
    ", vertex copying models generate networks with fixed degree distributions .",
    "* summary .",
    "* we can conclude that numerous network models result in power - law degree distributions where the exponent of the distribution is the function of the model parameters .",
    "however , it is common in all of the listed models that for a given parameter setting , the degree distribution remains the same during the growth the network . besides the above class of popular models , several papers report power - law growth for the average degree .",
    "the proposed models for this effect miss to capture the fact that while the degree increases , the exponent of the power - law degree distribution decreases in real networks when the exponent is above 2 .",
    "furthermore , in our measurements we report that the average degree grows as @xmath9 , and that is different from the densification law .",
    "in this section , we summarize the main properties and the measurement of the exponent and the average degree in graphs with power - law degree distributions .",
    "we follow newman @xcite for properties of power - law distributions and @xcite for fitting the exponent . our main goal is to review and emphasize seemingly simple facts that often become problematic or misleading in experimentation .",
    "we also extend the discussion to prepare the background for our new models .",

    "estimating the exponent of a power - law distribution can be problematic in case of shifts in the distribution  @xcite , or when exponential cutoffs  @xcite modify the shape of the distribution . to overcome these problems , specific estimates",

    "all these networks are grown in time by processes where each node and edge is added to the network only once , and no node or edge is ever deleted .",
    "our first task is to measure the connection between the power law exponent , the average degree , and the fraction of nonzero degree nodes as in equations   and   as the networks grow .",
    "we will also investigate the importance of time in how different types of new nodes and edges may appear in these graphs .",

    "we selected networks from the collection with timestamped edges evenly distributed in time , and degree distribution close to power law .",
    "for example , we discarded networks that were crawled for several weeks but a significant part of their edges appeared within one day .              in our measurements",

    "may however be misleading , since @xmath34 already grows at least linearly with @xmath1 and the function will automatically be very close to linear as long as the average degree is small . indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : avgdeg - densification ] ( bottom ) , initially the average degree is around 1 , and it slowly starts to increase in all of our networks , which results in a linear growth of @xmath34 for 34 orders of magnitude , without any structural reason .",

    "we may conclude that the degree distribution changes in time such that the probability of larger degree nodes increases while the power law exponent decreases .      in this section",
    "we connect two previous observations , the growth of the average degree and the decrease of the degree distribution exponent .",

    "we show the observed @xmath39 , while on the right , the fitted @xmath22 by the methods of section  [ sect : fit ] , i.e.  the values @xmath29 , @xmath32 and the set @xmath45 as in equation  .",

    "since the calculation for the average degree tends to infinity as the power law exponent tends to 2 in  , the value is highly sensitive to the variation of the fitted exponent when it is close to 2 . keeping the sensitivity of the estimates near exponent 2 in mind , we observe that the connection between the average degree and the exponent estimates are consistent with the equations   and  .",
