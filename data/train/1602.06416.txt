    "lattice models of particle flow may show surprisingly rich behavior even when only exclusion of a particle on the same site is considered @xcite .",
    "complex percolation behavior arises in particular at increased particle concentration ( see @xcite for a modern account on percolation theory , @xcite for a case study related to the motion of colloids in narrow channels , and @xcite for percolation effects in transportation in more general complex systems ) . in this paper , we introduce a two dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion random walk model with diffusion and drift .",
    "the model aims at capturing the effect of the barrier positioned in the strip on the corresponding residence times , i.e. , the time needed by a particle to cross the strip .",
    "more precisely , we consider a ( say ) vertical strip and measure the time that a particle entering the strip at the top side takes to exit the strip through the bottom side , under the assumption that the three other boundaries act as reflecting boundaries .",
    "this typical time will be called _ residence _ time .",
    "we find an interesting non ",
    "linear dependence on the length of this barrier when simulating the evolution of a high particle density in the strip . instead of the expected increase in the residence time , at particular conditions we surprisingly notice a decrease in residence times with increasing barrier length .",
    "this reminds us of the braess paradox , discovered when traffic flow unexpectedly decreases , whereas an inhibitive traffic access barrier is removed ( cf .",
    "this confirms once more the fact that as population densities and the number of interactions between particles ( agents , people , financial stocks , etc . )",
    "increase , so does the probability of emergent phenomena .    our modeling approach and simulation results are potentially useful when trying to forecast the motion of pedestrian flows in open ( heterogeneous ) spaces .",
    "it has for instance been found that flocking of sheep @xcite is helped by introducing a barrier before an exit point . also high density particle flow through an orifice that leads to jamming has been found to have less jamming when a barrier is put in front of the orifice ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite for crowd dynamics scenarios when the flow is improved by the presence of an obstacle in front of the exit ) .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "according to the lattice model simulations reported in this paper , the effect of the barrier on the residence time is surprising : at low flux the system may show decreased residence time of particles when passage barrier is increased , instead of the expected decrease in residence time .",
    "we find three different flow regimes of interest .",
    "the regime of zero drift , where the residence time increases with barrier length .",
    "the barrier generates an increase in density before the barrier and a wake behind .",
    "the density changes are comparable .",
    "the increase in residence time is due to the lowered derivative of density at the entrance of the stripe , that is due to the increased density before the barrier .",
    "the concentration of particles before the barrier is such that these particles can be considered to be in the percolation regime .",
    "the system becomes increasingly jammed .",
    "the regime of non  zero drift , but with an exit density @xmath0 .",
    "this is the regime of high flux ( see @xcite ) without percolation inhibition .",
    "the residence time in this regime is independent of the bottom boundary density . when the barrier increases the residence time increases for a similar reason as in the zero  drift case .",
    "when @xmath1 becomes larger that @xmath2 the residence time increases steeply and the density before the barrier increases such that it is in the percolation regime .",
    "it is dominated again by the derivative of density at the entrance of strip .",
    "the regime of non  zero drift , but with exit density @xmath3 .",
    "this is the regime of low flux .",
    "when the damkhler number , i.e. , the ratio between the external drift and the diffusion coefficient , is sufficiently large , the non  linear dependence of residence time on the barrier width appears .",
    "the residence time decreases with increasing value of barrier @xmath4 until a limiting value of @xmath5 is reached .",
    "this critical width is such that its ratio with the horizontal length of the strip is equal or less than @xmath6 . beyond this value of @xmath4",
    "the residence time increases steeply with increasing @xmath4 , as expected for the onset of increased jamming .",
    "the difference between the high flux and low flux regime is due to the very different dependence of @xmath7 $ ] when @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "more precisely , consider the @xmath9 plots in figures  [ fig : width - profile - comparison - drift-01 - 1 ] and [ fig : width - profile - comparison - drift-01 - 2 ] , the related graphs of the function @xmath7 $ ] behave as follows : as long as @xmath0 the function @xmath7 $ ] will have a maximum in @xmath10 $ ] , since @xmath11 varies between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath7 $ ] varies from negative to positive when @xmath14 or the opposite way when @xmath15 . when @xmath3 the sign of the derivative of @xmath7 $ ] depends on @xmath16 .",
    "it is always positive ( @xmath17 ) or negative ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the contribution of drift to current is proportional to the x derivative of @xmath7 $ ] . since this can only become zero , when @xmath0 or @xmath18 , the zero drift and drift curves only cross when @xmath0",
    "this causes the density distribution when drift is not zero to be less than that of the drift zero density distribution .",
    "it becomes equal to @xmath6 over a large density regime when @xmath3 and drift exceeds a particular value ( this value falls between @xmath19 and @xmath20 in figures  [ fig : rt_rhodown_comparison ] and [ fig : nonlinear - rt ] .",
    "the case @xmath0 ( figure  [ f : ultima ] first and second panel from the left ) : the barrier reduces transmission from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , since the density gradient at @xmath23 has the same sign before and after barrier . also directly behind the barrier @xmath17 , since this gives a positive contribution to the flow rate , the density dependence on @xmath24 then is concave .",
    "reduced transmission through the barrier increases the density before the barrier into the @xmath3 regime , that is the percolation regime . behind the barrier a wake develops of lower density .",
    "the flow rates before as well after the barrier decrease .",
    "the case @xmath3 ( figure  [ f : ultima ] third and fourth panel from the left ) : when @xmath3 the @xmath24 derivative of @xmath7 $ ] is negative as long as @xmath14 .",
    "an initial convex shape of density profile of the wake behind the barrier implies @xmath14 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the flow rate now increases , because in the wake the density is reduced and @xmath7 $ ] then increases .",
    "density reduction when barrier width is small is initially in the percolation regime .",
    "since the derivative @xmath16 before the barrier is negative and positive after the barrier , the second derivative of @xmath9 is discontinuous .",
    "barrier transmission is not hindered as long as @xmath25 , where the derivative @xmath16 changes sign .",
    "when @xmath4 remains less than @xmath5 there is no increase in density before the barrier . at this condition",
    "the fast flow in the wake of barrier drains density from the front of the barrier , so that it is maintained at the density it also has in absence of the barrier .",
    "the current increases with increasing barrier width , until no density reduction in the wake is any more possible and the initial sign of @xmath16 becomes negative .",
    "then reduced transmission through the barrier increases density before the barrier and current decreases .",
    "this analysis has been done for the projection of the two dimensional changes in density onto a one dimensional density . in the two dimensional case , a relative value of the horizontal displacement @xmath26 has been used . in that case",
    "there is rapid diffusion of density before the barrier to the opening positions between barrier and wall , and after the barrier into the wake region . in the low flux region ,",
    "the low density that develops in the wake also reduces density between barrier and wall so that density transport from before the barrier to the open space region is enhanced .",
    "the one dimensional analysis indicates that asymmetrical density development is indeed caused by the convex residence time function of @xmath11 in the high flux region , that ultimately is due to percolation .    in the recent paper @xcite the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process",
    "has been applied to a molecular motor transport model on a network . whereas the network is different from our strip model and drift equals one , the paper @xcite finds also non  linear dependence on motor particle density when its global density exceeds a critical value and network exit rate is asymmetric .",
    "also in this case the critical behavior depends on the derivative of @xmath7 $ ] as we propose in this paper .",
