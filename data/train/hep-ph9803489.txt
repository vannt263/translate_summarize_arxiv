    "large @xmath3 limit is one of the most important and model - independent method of nonperturbative qcd in spite of the realistic @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "hqet in this limit , for the heavy baryon case , is often believed to be the heavy quark skyrme model @xcite .",

    ", heavy baryon has @xmath33 light quarks .",

    "the point is that for heavy baryon weak decay form factors , the skyrme model result is not exactly identical to that of large @xmath3 . consider the leading isgur - wise function , our large @xmath3 argument for @xmath29 also applies to @xmath38 , that is @xmath39 . because @xmath40 , we expect that the leading isgur - wise function is @xmath41-function like , @xmath42 in the large @xmath3 limit .",
