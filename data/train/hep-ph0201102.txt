    "the problem of laser light compton scattering on high - energy electrons are now considered in the projects relating to the creation of @xmath1 colliders , laser - synchrotron sources , laser cooling , diagnostic of sub - picosecond electron bunches and others @xcite .",
    "it is supposed that intensity of laser flash in these problems is so high that an electron can undergo several successive collisions passing through a photon bunch @xcite .",
    "the distributions over the electrons energy and collisions number , the moments of these distributions , and the spectra of scattered photons have been studied in this paper using corresponding kinetic equations and by statistical simulation methods .",
    "it is seen from this analysis that multiple scattering of electrons influences on the spectra both electrons and photons even for the photon target of small thickness .",
    "penetration of an electron through a photon target is a stochastic process , where both the number of collisions of each electron with photons and the energy loss in individual collision are random .",
    "let us consider an electron with energy @xmath2 traveling through a bunch of photons with energy @xmath3 .",
    "the typical value of the scattering electron angle in the compton back - scattering process is determined by the laser photon energy @xmath3 and does nt depend on the electron energy @xmath2 :    @xmath4    @xmath5 being the rest energy of electron .",
    "we shall consider the head - on collisions of laser photons with energy @xmath6 ev and electrons with energy @xmath7 gev .",
    "in this case the electron deflection angle is much less than characteristic radiation angle @xmath8 and one can neglect the electron angular deflection ( the straight - ahead approximation ) . in this approximation",

    "note that @xmath25 is the mean number of collisions of an electron per unit path length and @xmath14 is the mean number of an electron collisions with energy loss in unit interval about @xmath16 per unit path length .",
    "the first term in the right side of eq . ( [ sec : pn ] ) corresponds to electrons which pass the path @xmath26 without collisions and @xmath27 is corresponding probability .",
    "these electrons have to undergo @xmath28 collisions along the rest path @xmath29 the second term corresponds to the electrons which undergo the first scattering passing the path @xmath26 and @xmath30 is corresponding probability .",
    "these electrons have to undergo @xmath31 collisions after that but the energy of electron after first scattering equals @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is random energy of the scattered photon and @xmath34 is the probability density function of @xmath16 . in the limit @xmath35 eq .",

    "the invariant dimensionless parameter @xmath67 is small and the integral interaction coefficients @xmath25 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57    are described by the approximate formulas    @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    where @xmath71    the quantities @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the mean energy loss and the mean squared energy loss of an electron per unit path length .",

    "( [ n - sol ] ) is due to increasing of the interaction cross - section because of electron energy loss in collisions .",

    "this number was selected from the poisson distribution with fixed @xmath94 .",
    "the simulation of individual collisions was carried out in the electron rest frame using the klein and nishina formula with the lorentz transformation to the lab system . in the same way as in analytical calculations above we neglected the angular deflection of electrons but accounted for the energy decreasing after each collision .",
