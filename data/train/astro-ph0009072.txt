    "witten@xcite discovered that in many theories , cosmic strings could acquire a condensate of zero - mass particles , and thus could behave as superconducting wires carrying charge or current .",
    "the existence of charges and currents on the string can substantially modify its dynamics .",
    "if the charge and current are large enough , the string may have a stable static configuration known as a vorton @xcite .    for a non - superconducting string ,",
    "as long as the string thickness ( typically a tiny microphysical quantity ) is small as compared to its radius of curvature ( typically of cosmological size ) , the motion of the string is given by the nambu - goto equations of motion , which are easily solved . with an appropriate choice of parameter ( gauge ) , the string position can be given by a function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 parameterizes the energy on the string , and @xmath2 is the ordinary time coordinate . the general motion of the string can then be written . ]",
    "[ eqn : motion ] ( , t ) = where the functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 are arbitrary except that they must obey the constraints | ( ) |^2 & = & 1 +     in general , a nambu - goto string loop will have two or more points at which @xmath5 .",
    "such a point is called a cusp .",
    "it has @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath8 ; a point moves at the speed of light .    for a superconducting string ,",
    "the equations of motion are much more complicated . however , if we can neglect long - range electromagnetic interactions ( either because the condensate is not coupled to the electromagnetic field , or because such corrections are small ) , the situation is much simpler .",
    "if furthermore the current is `` chiral '' ( charge and current equal in magnitude ) , then the equations can be solved exactly@xcite .",
    "this situation can occur both in strings which can carry currents in only one direction@xcite , but also in more usual superconducting strings . as the string approaches a cusp ,",
    "all charge - carriers will be accelerated , and left - moving and right - moving charge carriers can scatter with each other and be ejected from the string .",
    "this will lead to a predominance of whichever type of charge - carrier was in larger numbers originally , and thus an approach to a chiral state .    in the chiral case , the motion",
    "is still given by eq.([eqn : motion ] ) , but now the constraints are [ eqn : newconstraints]| ( ) |^2 & = & 1 +    @xmath4 exchanged , depending on the direction of current flow ) , where @xmath9 is a measure of the magnitude of the current , to be discussed later . from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : motion ] ) and ( [ eqn : newconstraints ] ) we can see that such a string can not have a cusp , per se .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath11 have different magnitudes , they can not cancel exactly , and since @xmath12 , we can not have @xmath13 .",
    "however , if @xmath14 , then we can have an event that looks very similar to a nambu - goto cusp at large distances , but has a different structure near the place that the cusp would have occurred",
    ". thus we will consider a point with @xmath10 and @xmath11 pointing in opposite directions , even though their magnitudes are different , so @xmath15 .",
    "this means that @xmath16 has some small but nonzero magnitude .",
    "we will show that this can lead to a self - intersection near the cusp and the emission of a vorton .",
    "because the two - dimensional world sheet current is conserved , we can describe it as the curl of an auxiliary scalar field @xmath17 .",
    "the world sheet current is then [ eqn : current ] j^a = q 1 ^ab _ , b where @xmath18 is the electric charge multiplied by the integral of the field density across the string core , and renormalized if necessary , and @xmath19 is the induced metric in the world sheet . the physical current is j^(x ) = ddt j^ax^ _ , a^(4)(x - x ( , t ) ) = qd^ab _ , a x^ _ , b^(3 ) ( - ( , t ) )    in the chiral case , we can assume without loss of generality that the charge carriers move in the negative @xmath1 direction , so that @xmath17 is a function only of @xmath20 , and thus @xmath21",
    ". we will define @xmath22 , which gives the constraints of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : newconstraints ] ) .",
    "the current @xmath9 is dimensionless and gives a measure of the ratio of the energy in the current to the energy in the string .",
    "with @xmath23 we would have @xmath24 which gives a static vorton solution .",
    "we will consider a cusp in a string loop with @xmath25 , and we will define @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and let subscript @xmath28 denotes quantities at the time and place of the cusp .",
    "we have @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and so _0 & = & ( _0 + _0)/2 = ( /2)_0 + _ 0 & = & ( _0-_0)/2 = - 1 + 2_0    in@xcite we showed that , for an ordinary string cusp , one can choose a lorentz frame in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 are parallel . in the appendix , we extend this result to chiral superconducting strings , and show that we can work in a frame with @xmath33 and @xmath32 parallel . in that frame",
    ", we can expand the position of the string at the time of the cusp .",
    "we take the cusp to occur at @xmath34 and its position to be @xmath35 .",
    "thus ( ) = _0+_0 ^ 22 + ",
    "_0 ^ 36 + if @xmath33 and @xmath32 point in opposite directions , which one would expect roughly half the time , then the string will intersect itself at @xmath36 , where _ 1 = this self - intersection will lead to an intercommutation and the emission of a loop containing the original string from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "after the intercommutation , the main string will have kinks where the cusp would have been , and there will be a small loop ( also with kinks ) that has been produced by intercommutation . the effect on the main string is very similar to emission of string due to overlap of the core , as discussed in @xcite",
    ". here we will study the small loop that is emitted .",
    "first of all , what amount of the string is emitted ?",
    "the magnitude of @xmath33 is @xmath39 , while @xmath32 could be expected to be of order @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the size of the original loop , or the typical feature size in the case of a long string .",
    "thus we expect @xmath42 .",
    "if we start out , for example , with 1% of the vorton current , then roughly 1% of the original loop will be chopped off .",
    "we would like to compute the velocity and rest - frame properties of the emitted loop .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is given by@xcite t^ = dd(^ab + ^ab ) x^_,a x^_,b^4 [ x - x ( , ) ] = d^ab x^ _ , b x^_,a^3 [ -(,t ) ] and thus the total energy - momentum in a region is p^=d^3xt^0 = d^ab x^ _ , bx^0_,a = dx^since @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 , and so the emitted energy is just @xmath45 , which is just the energy in a segment of string of length @xmath46 .",
    "we can expand @xmath47 in a taylor series , = _ 0+_0+^2_0 and integrate to find the momentum , = 2_1_0+_1 ^ 33_0 = e ( _ 0+_1 ^ 26_0)= e(-_0 + 2_0+_1 ^ 26_0 ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath48 is 1 , whereas the magnitude of the second term is @xmath49 , and the third is likewise @xmath49 , since @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , the second and third terms can not cancel , because @xmath52 is p = e [ 1-o ( ) ] .",
    "the rest - frame energy of the loop is @xmath53 , so the length of the loop in its rest frame is _",
    "1 = ^-1 = ^-1 e o ( ) = 2_1 o ( j ) = o ( l ) since @xmath17 is a scalar , it is unaffected by the boost .",
    "the current @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath54 and thus is enhanced by the ratio of @xmath1 in the moving frame to @xmath1 in the rest frame , which is @xmath55 .",
    "the new value is @xmath56 , so we have essentially a vorton .    what is the boost vector @xmath57 that brings the loop to rest",
    "? it must point in the direction of @xmath58 and should give a lorentz factor @xmath59 .",
    "thus the boost should have magnitude @xmath60 , so @xmath61 . then from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fbdef ] ) , @xmath62 . from eq",
    "( [ eqn : jtransform ] ) the current at the cusp transforms as _ 0 = f_bj_0~1 , in accord with the above , and from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : j2transform ] ) the derivative of the current is _0 = f_b^2j_0+f_bf_b , b j_0 ~j_0j_0 ^ 2 +  _ 0j_0 ^ 3 .",
    "now @xmath63 , so the second term is of the same order as the first , and @xmath64 .",
    "this means that the change in current over the loop is ( _ 1 ) -_0~(1/(j_0l))j_0 ^ 2l = j_0 _ 0~1 and thus the current is essentially constant over the loop .",
    "we have shown that cusps ( or , perhaps more properly , `` cusp - like events '' ) in chiral strings come in two forms .",
    "if @xmath32 points in the same direction as @xmath33 , in the frame in which these are parallel , then the cusp is merely smoothed out , as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cusps ] .",
    "however , if @xmath32 points in the opposite direction to @xmath33 , then there is a self intersection , as shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cusps ] .",
    "we thus expect that half of all cusps in strings with chiral currents will have self intersections .",
    "when the string does intersect itself , intercommutation emits a loop of string with large lorentz factor which is approximately in a vorton state already , and could be expected to become a stable vorton .",
    "what about currents which are not chiral ?",
    "we do not have an exact solution in this case , but we expect similar behavior .",
    "the effect of the current is still to prevent the string from doubling back on itself , so there will be a finite value of @xmath33 where the point of the cusp would have been .",
    "this vector controls the shape very close to this point .",
    "further away , however , the effect of @xmath32 becomes more important , and if these vectors point in opposite directions , we might expect a self intersection .    if a system of strings can produce vortons , then it is very likely that the vortons will contribute to the matter density of the universe in amounts excess of observation",
    ". thus most such theories are ruled out@xcite . for a string to become a vorton ,",
    "the current must somehow rise to the necessary level to oppose the tension in the string .",
    "we have shown here a new mechanism by which strings with small currents can nevertheless produce stable vortons .",
    "this mechanism may lead to vorton production in more theories than would otherwise have this problem , and thus restrict further the range of allowable superconducting string theories .",
    "it should be noted that , in the case of the string with chiral current and no coupling to the electromagnetic field , the motion will be strictly periodic@xcite . after a single cusp has formed at a particular point in the oscillation of the string loop , and",
    "a vorton has been emitted , there will be a kink , rather than a cusp , and no further emission of vortons .",
    "however , long strings , currents that are not exactly chiral , and coupling to the electromagnetic field produce motion which is not exactly periodic , and thus perhaps lead to ongoing vorton emission . smoothing of the kink may also produce future cusps , as discussed in@xcite .",
    "in this appendix we extend our results@xcite for lorentz boosting of ordinary string cusps to superconducting strings with chiral currents .",
    "the motion of a chiral superconducting string is given by eq.([eqn : motion ] ) with the constraints of eqs.([eqn : newconstraints ] ) .",
    "following the technique of @xcite , we can treat the current in the same way as the physical position by considering a 4 + 1-dimensional spacetime where the fourth spatial component of @xmath4 is @xmath65 , so that the fourth spatial component of @xmath66 is @xmath9 .",
    "since the current travels only in one direction , the new components of @xmath67 and its derivatives are all 0 .    in this appendix",
    ", we will let @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the 3-space vectors previously called @xmath67 and @xmath4 , let @xmath67 and @xmath4 denote the new 4-space vectors , and introduce 5-dimensional spacetime vectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 .        at the cusp , we can take @xmath72 , which is parallel to @xmath73 , as the `` direction of the cusp '' .",
    "the vector @xmath74 is perpendicular to this vector , but @xmath75 will not be perpendicular .",
    "instead we have , at the cusp , 0 =   = -  +jj so ",
    "_ 3_3 =  ",
    "= jj. we can define a new vector @xmath76 , so that  = 0 .",
    "now we have two vectors , @xmath74 and @xmath77 , in general independent , which are both perpendicular to @xmath78 .",
    "both have vanishing component in the current direction .",
    "thus if we can find a frame where @xmath79 is perpendicular to both @xmath74 and @xmath77 , then @xmath80 must be parallel to @xmath78 .",
