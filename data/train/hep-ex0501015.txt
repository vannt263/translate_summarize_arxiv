    "the 90@xmath7 confidence upper limits on the observed number of @xmath0(3872 ) events in @xmath4 fusion and isr mediated production are determined to be @xmath65 @xmath9 2.36 for both processes .",
    "systematic uncertainty arises from possible biases in the detection efficiency and estimated background level .",
    "these are studied by varying the event selection criteria described above .",
    "other systematic uncertainties are from the @xmath2 luminosity measurement and @xmath5 branching fractions . adding these in quadrature , the total systematic uncertainties in @xmath4 fusion and isr are 18.5@xmath7 and 13.2@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "a conservative way to incorporate these systematic uncertainties is to increase the measured upper limits by these amounts .",
    "this leads to the 90@xmath7 confidence upper limits @xmath66 for @xmath0(3872 ) having positive c parity and @xmath67 for @xmath0(3872 ) being a vector meson with @xmath31 = 1@xmath68 .",

    "this leads to 90@xmath7 confidence upper limits @xmath76 and @xmath77 the ( 2@xmath78 + 1)@xmath79 upper limit is almost 1/4 the corresponding values for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , but it is nearly 6 times larger than the prediction for the 1@xmath37d@xmath36 state of charmonium @xcite . the upper limit for @xmath82(@xmath0(3872 ) ) is comparable to the measured electron width of @xmath83 and is about 1/2 that of @xmath84 @xcite .",
