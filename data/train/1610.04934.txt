    "natural gas production from shale formation has received significant attention recently and can potentially lead to a new global energy source .",
    "for example , according to the u.s .",
    "energy administration , shale gas provides the largest source of the growth in u.s . natural gas supply during the past decade , and its share is expected to grow continually in the future @xcite . to enable the effective extraction of shale gas , accurate prediction of gas recovery from shale formation",
    "is needed .",
    "predicting the gas recovery from shale formations requires a fundamental understanding of the gas transport in these formations .",
    "a unique aspect of shale formations is that gas are mostly trapped in ultra - tight rock pores with permeability on the order of nanodarcies @xcite .",
    "the pore size of these shale matrices spans from a few to several hundred nanometers @xcite , and the number of nanopores in shale gas reservoirs is much larger than that in conventional gas reservoirs @xcite . because the size of nanopores can become comparable and even smaller than the intrinsic length scale of the gas ( i.e. , the mean free path ) or the length scale of the molecular interactions between gas molecules and pore walls ,",
    "gas transport in nanopores can deviate from that in macropores .",
    "much insight has been gained on such transport thanks for the extensive research in the past century @xcite .",
    "for example , the nature of gas transport in nanopores depends on the knudsen number @xmath3 , which is the ratio of the local gas mean free path ( @xmath4 ) to the pore width ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "the gas flow is classified into different regimes including continuum flows ( @xmath6 ) , slip flows ( @xmath7 ) , transition flows ( @xmath8 ) ; and molecular flows ( @xmath9 ) @xcite . except in the continuum",
    "flow regime , the no - slip boundary condition and/or the navier - stokes equations are not strictly valid . under these conditions , more advanced models , most of which based on kinetic theories , have been be used .",
    "for example , various slip models have been used to describe the slippage effect on the pore walls @xcite .",
    "in addition to the non - classical flow behaviors , prior research also indicated that the knudsen diffusion can dominate the transport process in nanopores when the knudsen number is large because the collisions between gas molecules and pore wall are more frequent than collisions between gas molecules @xcite .",
    "these insights are highly relevant to the gas transport in shale gas formations . for instance",
    ", chen and co - workers constructed the structure of shale formation using the markov chain monte carlo method and simulated the gas transport in the constructed structures using the lattice boltzmann method @xcite .",
    "their simulations indicated that gas flow in shale formation differs greatly from the darcy flow , and the knudsen diffusion always plays a role in shale gas transport .",
    "finally , when the pore width approaches the length scale of molecular gas - pore wall interactions ( usually on the order of a few nanometers ) , the gas transport within the pore is strongly affected by these interactions @xcite .",
    "building on the fundamental understanding of gas transport in nanopores , many theoretical and simulation studies on the recovery of gas from shale formations have been carried out @xcite .",
    "much of these works showed that the gas recovery from shale formation is effectively a diffusive process : during the early stage of gas recovery , the cumulative gas production obeys a simple scaling law @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the recovery fraction of the total trapped gas inside the shale formation recovered between time @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the gas production rate . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are pre - factors that depend on the size of pore , the initial pressure of gas inside the pore , etc . during the late stage of gas recovery , the gas production rate decreases exponentially and is often not useful for practical gas recovery operations .",
    "while the scaling laws in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) have indeed been observed in some field experiments , other behavior has also been reported .",
    "for example , data compiled from the gas production from 25 wells of barnett shale@xcite showed that , during the early stage of gas production , the decay of the production rate approximately follows a power law with an index @xmath17 , the accumulative gas recovery thus observes a super - diffusive scaling law @xmath18 with @xmath19 . at present , the physical origin of this super - diffusive scaling is not yet well understood .",
    "nevertheless , some studies have shown that the desorption of gas from pore walls tends to make the decay of gas production rate slower , but its effect on the scaling of gas production was not discussed @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the gas recovery from single nanopores using molecular dynamic ( md ) simulation .",
    "in particular , we focus on the scaling laws for gas recovery fraction and the impact of gas - pore wall interactions on gas transport inside the pore and the gas recovery from the pore .",
    "our work is inspired in part by prior studies on shale gas recovery @xcite .",
    "while these studies have provided powerful insights into the dynamics of shale gas recovery , some important issues were not yet addressed .",
    "for example , since they are based on classical kinetic theories , these studies do not clarify the effects of molecular gas - wall interactions .",
    "these interactions are expected to be important in pores narrower than a few nanometers , which are abundant in some shale formations @xcite . by using md simulations to study the gas recovery from nanopores",
    ", we will explicitly address these issues .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the md model for gas recovery from nanopores , the md simulation method , and our simulation protocol . in sec [ sec : results ] , we present our simulation results on gas recovery , focusing on its qualitative nature ( i.e. , scaling law of gas recovery ) and its quantitative aspect ( i.e. , rate of gas production and the total diffusion coefficients of gas inside pores ) .",
    "finally the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "simulation of gas recovery from shale formations appears extremely difficult due to the vastly different scales of pore sizes in shale formations ( from a few nanometers to millimeters ) , the diverse structures and surface chemistry of these pores , and the complicated connectivity between these pores .",
    "nevertheless , it has been recognized that the overall gas recovery from the formation is limited by the transport of gas from the narrow pores to large fractures @xcite .",
    "in addition , prior studies have shown that the essential features of gas recovery is captured well by pore scale modeling utilizing simple pore geometries , e.g. cylindrical or slit pores @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study the gas recovery from slit - shaped nanopore with a constant width using md simulations . while this nanopore model does not take into account the rich structure and chemical properties of pores in shale formations",
    ", it does allow us to focus on the generic features of gas recovery in nanopores in shale formations .",
    "the insight gained in this study can form a foundation for understanding gas recovery from more realistic pores .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a schematic of the md system .",
    "the system features a slit pore , a gas bath , a piston , and the methane gas molecules inside the pore and the gas bath .",
    "the right end of the pore is permanently sealed .",
    "initially , the left end of the pore is sealed by fixing some blocker atoms at its outlet ( the black spheres in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and gas inside the pore has higher pressure than in the gas bath . during gas recovery simulations , the left end of the pore",
    "is made open by removing those blocker atoms . in this setup , the slit pore can be considered as one of the many pores within a shale - rock matrix , while the gas bath can be considered as the secondary fracture in the shale formation , whose permeability is orders of magnitude larger than that of the shale - rock matrix and thus has a nearly constant pressure @xcite . the center - to - center width @xmath5 of the nanopore is 2 nm since pores with such small size are abundant in many shale formations @xcite . because of the finite size of the methane molecules and the wall atoms , the accessible pore width in md model @xmath20 is about 1.62 nm . the pore length @xmath21 is 202.5 nm",
    ". the left side of the gas bath is bounded by a piston plate , whose atoms move only in the @xmath22-direction . to maintain a constant pressure @xmath23 inside the gas bath ,",
    "an external force @xmath24 is applied on the piston plate ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the plates width in @xmath27- and @xmath28-directions , respectively ) .",
    "the external force is distributed on the atoms of the piston plate such that the plate remains planar .",
    "hereafter , the md model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] will be termed nanopore - piston model for brevity .",
    "the methane molecules are modeled as structureless , spherical molecules .",
    "the interactions between a methane molecule @xmath29 and any another atom @xmath30 in the system are modeled using the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath31    \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the lj parameters for the interaction pair , and @xmath34 is the distance between the two molecules . the piston plate is modeled as a square lattice of carbon atoms ( lattice spacing : 0.3 nm ) .",
    "we confirmed that the simulation results are independent of the mass for piston plate atoms .",
    "the pore walls are modeled as semi - infinite slabs constructed from a fcc lattice oriented in the @xmath35 direction ( following ref . , the lattice constant is taken as 0.54 nm ) .",
    "explicitly modeling all wall atoms will incur significant computational cost . to overcome this difficulty , only the innermost layer of the wall atoms ( i.e. , the layer in contact with methane molecules )",
    "is explicitly modeled .",
    "since the discreteness of atoms behind the innermost layer is barely felt by the gas atoms inside the pore due to the short - ranged nature of the lj potential , these wall atoms are treated collectively as an implicit slab , and any methane molecule inside the system interacts with this implicit slab of wall atoms ( the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) via the lj 9 - 3 potential @xmath36    \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the number density of the wall atoms in the implicit slab , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the lj parameters for interactions between wall atoms and methane molecules , and @xmath40 is the distance between the methane particles and the surface of the implicit slab .",
    "although such a wall model does not reflect the rich chemical nature of shale formation , it can well capture the notable adsorption of gas on pore walls .",
    "the lj parameters for the methane molecules and the wall atoms are taken from refs . and , which describe gas - silica interactions .",
    "while this choice is less relevant to surfaces of organic matters , it is reasonable for mineral surfaces , which are commonly found in shale gas formations .",
    "more importantly , the gas - wall potential parameters adopted here lead to a gas adsorption similar to those found in prior studies of gas adsorption in shale formations @xcite .",
    "this allows us to delineate the essential physics of gas recovery in presence of gas adsorption on pore walls , which is one of the important aspects in gas recovery from shale formations .",
    "the lj parameters used in this study are summarized in table [ forcefields ] .",
    ".lennard - jones parameters for interactions between molecules .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ forcefields ]    simulations are performed using the lammps code @xcite with a time step size of 2 fs .",
    "cutoff lengths of 1.2 nm and 1.5 nm are used in the calculation of the methane - methane interactions and the methane - wall interactions , respectively . in each simulation , the number of methane molecules inside the system is kept as constant and the pore walls are fixed in position .",
    "the dimensions of the simulation box are kept constant , but the volume of the gas bath increases during gas recovery simulation as its pressure is maintained by the piston wall ( note that the simulation box is large enough in the x - direction that the piston plate never crosses its left boundary ) .",
    "the temperature of the methane molecules is maintained at 373 k using the nose - hoover thermostat . to explore the mechanisms of the gas recovery process",
    ", we designed several simulation cases with different pressures in the gas bath ( @xmath41 bar ) while the initial gas pressure in the nanopore is fixed at @xmath42 bar .",
    "these choices of the initial gas pressure in the nanopore , the pressure in the gas bath , and the gas temperature , have been used in recent simulations @xcite and are relevant to the situations in some shale formations .",
    "each simulation consists of three steps . in step",
    "a , the blocker atoms at the pore entrance are removed and @xmath43 on the piston plate is set to a value corresponding to the gas bath pressure @xmath44 .",
    "the system is then evolved to equilibrium . in step b ,",
    "the blocker atoms at the pore entrance are reinstated and @xmath43 on the piston plate is set to a value corresponding to the gas bath pressure @xmath45 .",
    "the system is then evolved till equilibrium is reached in the gas bath . in step c ,",
    "the blocker atoms at the pore entrance are removed ( this moment is defined as @xmath46 ) while @xmath43 on the piston plate remains at the value set in the previous step .",
    "the system is evolved for 200ns to study the gas recovery from the nanopore . during each simulation ,",
    "the density , pressure , and temperature of gas in both the nanopore and the gas bath are computed on - the - fly .",
    "each simulation was repeated three times with different initial configurations to obtain reliable statistics .",
    "we quantify the recovery of gas from the nanopore by computing a dimensionless recovery fraction ( @xmath47 ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the cumulative production of mole of gas from the nanopore , and @xmath50 is the mole of gas in the nanopore at the initial state ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "@xmath52 is a dimensionless time @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the characteristic time for the gas recovery process .",
    "since the knudsen diffusion often dominates the transport of gas in the narrow pore considered here and gas recovery from nanopores is often a diffusive process @xcite , @xmath54 is chosen as @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath21 is the pore length . @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the knudsen number and the molecular diffusion coefficient of the gas molecules inside the pore at the initial state , respectively .",

    "however , once the gas recovery operation starts , the gas density inside the pore drops and becomes non - uniform along the pore .",
    "the gas transport transitions into the knudsen regime in some positions of the pore .",
    "in particular , at the pore entrance , the local pressure rapidly approaches the gas pressure in the bath and the knudsen number increases .",
    "for example , if the gas bath pressure is @xmath75 bar , the knudsen number of gas at the pore entrance reaches 1.12 soon after the gas recovery process starts .",
    "figure [ fig2]a shows the evolution of gas recovery fraction for several cases in which the initial pressure in the pore is fixed at @xmath44=250 bar while the gas bath pressure @xmath45 varies from 25 to 200 bar .",
    "the gas recovery fraction increases rapidly during the early stage of operation but increases very slowly for @xmath76 0.1 , similar to what was reported in prior works @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we focus on the initial stage of gas recovery since shale gas recovery at the late stage is usually too slow to be practically useful . for @xmath77 bar , @xmath78 during the early stage of operation , indicating that the gas recovery is quite close to a diffusive process @xcite , in which @xmath79 . however , for @xmath80 25 and 100 bar , @xmath81 , indicating that the gas recovery deviates more greatly from the diffusive scaling .",
    "this super - diffusive scaling differs from the prediction by prior theories qualitatively , but it resembles some reported experimental data .",
    "specifically , the average gas production rate obtained from 25 wells by baihly _",
    "et al_. @xcite showed that the production rate decays as @xmath82 and the accumulative gas recovery fraction increases on @xmath83 , which is faster than @xmath84 .",

    "@xmath89 is the gas flux given by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the total diffusion coefficient .",
    "note that isothermal transport is assumed in equation ( [ eq7 ] ) . according to kinetic theories",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath92 where @xmath86 is the gas density .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side is the gas advection including slippage effect and the second term is molecular and knudsen diffusion under linear diffusion conditions . for the gas recovery simulated in our md simulations , the initial and boundary conditions of equation ( [ eq7 ] )",
    "are given by @xmath93 where @xmath63 is the initial gas density inside the nanopore , and @xmath94 is the final density inside the pore . solving equations ( [ eq7])-([eq9 ] ) leads to a prediction of the gas recovery from the nanopore . during gas recovery operations",
    ", the gas density varies along the pore .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ dt_def ] ) that the total diffusion coefficient of the gas molecules inside the pore varies temporally and spatially during these operations . nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , the @xmath11 predicted by simulations based on equation ( [ dt_def ] ) agrees very well with simulations in which @xmath91 is taken to an appropriate constant ( hereafter we denote this constant the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath95 ; physically , we expect @xmath96 ) .",
    "when the total diffusion coefficient is taken as a constant @xmath95 , equation ( [ eq7 ] ) can be solved analytically @xcite , and the gas recovery at short time is given by @xmath97 fitting the gas recovery data from md simulations under the conditions of @xmath98 = ( 250 bar , 200 bar ) to equation ( [ ana ] ) , one extracts an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath99 m@xmath66/s , which is smaller than the total diffusion coefficient of gas given by equation ( [ dt_def ] ) at both @xmath100 250 bar ( @xmath101 m@xmath66/s ) and @xmath102200 bar ( 9.27@xmath103 m@xmath66/s ) .",
    "the smaller @xmath95 extracted from md data suggests that , for the situation examined here , the gas recovery rate is smaller than that predicted by the classical theories .",
    "the above results indicate that , depending on the operating conditions , the gas recovery from the narrow pore considered here can exhibit qualitatively different behavior ( e.g. , super - diffusive gas recovery ) or quantitatively lower gas recovery rate compared to those predicted by classical theories .",
    "these discrepancies can be attributed to the strong adsorption of gas molecules on the solid wall and the gas desorption during gas recovery process , which are often neglected in the classical theories .",
    "we first study why the gas recovery predicted by md simulations is slower than that predicted by the classical theory ; in another word , why the effective diffusion coefficient of gas molecules in the nanopore extracted from gas recovery data is smaller than the total diffusion coefficient given by equation ( [ dt_def ] ) . to this end",
    ", we compute the total diffusion coefficient of the gas molecules in nanopore using md simulations and examine its dependence on the strength of the gas - wall interaction .    to compute the total diffusion coefficient of gas molecules inside the nanopore , we built a separate md system consisting of a nanopore ( it is periodical along the @xmath104direction ) and the gas molecules inside it ( see inset of fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the width of the pore , the structure of pore walls , and the average gas density inside pore are identical to those in the nanopore - piston system .",
    "a constant force of @xmath105 pn is applied to each gas molecule in the @xmath104direction , and the average velocity of gas molecules is computed .",
    "since the total diffusion coefficient is defined based on the constitutive law of @xmath106 , it can not be computed directly from the above force - driven simulations .",
    "instead , it is determined using the darken equation @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the average velocity of gas molecules in the pore under a driving force of @xmath109 and @xmath29 is the fugacity .",
    "@xmath110 is the density in the gas bath , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are computed from the relation between the density and pressure of the gas confined inside the pore , which is determined during step a of the gas recovery simulation for the nanopore - piston system .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the total diffusion coefficient of the gas molecules confined in the pore when they interact with the pore walls with normal strength ( @xmath113 207.2 k ) or with reduced strength ( @xmath113 119.6 k ) . for comparison , the predictions by equation ( [ dt_def ] )",
    "are also shown . when pressure is less than @xmath114100 bar , molecule diffusion , knudsen diffusion , and advection with slip all play an important role ; for pressure larger than @xmath114100 bar , advection with slip dominates the overall diffusion coefficient . in agreement with the kinetic theory ,",
    "@xmath91 increases with pressure , which can be attributed to the important role of advection in nanopores with high gas density . for gas - wall interactions with normal strength",
    ", @xmath91 increases from 6.30@xmath11510@xmath116 to 7.17@xmath11510@xmath116 m@xmath66/s as the pressure inside the pore increases from 200 to 250 bar .",
    "we note that the @xmath95 determined from the gas recovery simulation operating with @xmath117 ( 250 bar , 200 bar ) is 4.62@xmath11510@xmath116m@xmath66/s , which is still somewhat smaller than the above range .",
    "this can be understood that the simulation with @xmath117 ( 250 bar , 200 bar ) is not a strictly diffusive gas recovery , hence the effective diffusion coefficient extracted from fitting the gas recovery to equation ( [ ana ] ) is not strictly accurate . over the entire range of pressure investigated here , @xmath91 computed from md simulation with normal gas - wall interactions is always smaller than that predicted by equation ( [ dt_def ] ) . when the gas - wall interaction is reduced , @xmath118 increases and approaches toward that predicted by the kinetic theories .",
    "this suggests that the strong gas - wall interactions cause the slower transport of gas inside the narrow pore compared to the kinetic theory predictions .",
    "strong gas - wall interactions slow down the transport of the gas molecules confined in nanopores because they lead to adsorption of gas molecules on the pore walls . under a given driving force ,",
    "the transport of these adsorbed molecules is slower compared to the free gas in the center of the pore because their friction with pore wall atoms .",
    "such an effect is especially obvious in narrow pores because , the fraction of the wall - adsorbed gas inside a pore increases as the pore size decreases .",
    "while these effects are not included in the diffusion model given by equation ( [ dt_def ] ) , which is derived from kinetic theories , they are explicitly included in md simulations .",
    "these effects can also be captured well using the theoretical models developed previously @xcite .",
    "since the diffusion coefficient can be computed very efficiently using these theoretical models , these models may be used to replace the diffusion model given by equation ( [ darken ] ) in future shale gas researches .",
    "the strong gas - wall interactions lead to significant adsorption of gas molecules on the pore wall . during a gas recovery operation , the pressure inside the pore drops and those adsorbed gas molecules gradually desorb from the pore wall . below",
    "we show that such gas desorption causes the super - diffusive gas recovery ( i.e. , @xmath119 , with @xmath120 ) observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the importance of gas desorption in the super - diffusive gas recovery is consistent with the observation that , for a fixed @xmath68 bar in the nanopore , super - diffusive gas recovery is observed only when the gas bath pressure is much lower than @xmath121 , i.e. , when @xmath80 25 or 100 bar but not when @xmath122 200 bar .",
    "this is because gas desorption from pore walls is minor during gas recovery if the initial pressure of gas inside the nanopore is close to the gas bath pressure .",
    "along a similar line , if the adsorption of gas on pore wall is weak at @xmath51 , the subsequent desorption of gas during gas recovery will be weak , and the super - diffusive gas recovery should be suppressed . to test this argument",
    ", we perform gas recovery simulations in the nanopore - piston system with reduced gas - wall interactions ( @xmath113119.6 k ) , and results are shown in fig .",
    "we observe that for @xmath123 ( 250 bar , 100 bar ) , @xmath78 , which is close to the @xmath124 , except at very short time ( @xmath125 ) . indeed , since adsorption / desorption can not be completely eliminated even if the reservoir pressure is close to the initial pore pressure or when gas - wall interactions are weak , weak deviation from the diffusive behavior is expected . while gas recovery operating under the same @xmath98 but with normal gas - wall interaction strength exhibits more distinct super - diffusive scaling .    to further ascertain that gas desorption causes the super - diffusive gas recovery shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we incorporate this effect into the classical gas recovery model and examine the gas recovery computed using the improved model .",

    "[ fig5]a , the peaks in the shaded region correspond to the adsorption of gas molecules on the surface .",
    "this adsorption is driven by the attractive van der waals forces between gas molecules and the wall : the potential energy of a gas molecule close to the wall is lower than in the pore center due to its van der waals interactions with the wall , hence it is energetically favorable for gas molecules to adsorb on the wall . in order to determine the gas adsorption on the pore wall",

    "in addition , the effective diffusion coefficient used above close to the range of @xmath91 computed through separate md simulations with normal gas - wall interaction strength ( @xmath156207.2 k ) ( @xmath157 4.10 @xmath114 7.17@xmath103 m / s@xmath66 from 25 to 250 bar , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the good agreement between the adt model and the md simulations confirms that the significant gas desorption impacts near the wall surface is responsible for the super - diffusive gas recovery observed in md simulations .",
    "in addition , while the adt model described above has been used in previous studies @xcite for shale gas recovery , it has not been validated quantitatively using more fundamental methods ( e.g. , md simulations ) to our knowledge .",
    "given that the adt model divides the gas within a nanopore into free gas and adsorbed gas ( with no lateral mobility but finite exchange with free gas ) while even adsorbed gas molecules have finite lateral mobility , it is not clear _ a priori _ that the adt model can predict the gas recovery accurately .",
    "this is especially true in narrow pores in which the division between the free gas and adsorbed gas is less sharp compared to wide pores .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] thus provides support for the effectiveness of the adt model despite its rather drastic simplification of the real gas adsorption , desorption , and transport processes in nanopores .",
    "because the adt model can capture the gas recovery behavior from nanopores well , we next use it to examine how the scaling law of gas recovery is affected by the properties of the nanopores .",
    "in particular , we vary the pore width @xmath20 and the maximal adsorption capacity of the pore wall @xmath137 to study how they affect the deviation of gas recovery from the classical diffusive behavior .",
    "figure [ fig7]a shows that , for a fixed @xmath149 nm@xmath150 , the gas recovery becomes more diffusive as the pore width increases and the classical diffusive scaling is recovered in pores with width of 8.1 nm .",
    "figure [ fig7]b shows that , for a fixed @xmath67 1.62 nm , gas recovery still exhibits notable super - diffusive behavior even when the maximal gas adsorption capacity reduces to @xmath158 nm@xmath150 .",
    "together , these results suggest that the super - diffusive gas recovery found in this work will likely occur in shale formations with pore size up to @xmath114 5 nm .",
    "we perform md simulation to investigate the gas extraction from single nanopores . the cumulative gas recovery and the effective diffusion coefficients for gas transport inside pores",
    "are studied .",
    "the results showed that , in very narrow pores , the strong gas - wall interactions can change the gas recovery behavior both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "these interactions slow down the gas recovery rate because they cause the total diffusion coefficients of the gas inside nanopores to be smaller than those predicted by kinetic theories .",
    "additionally , these interactions lead to significant adsorption of gas molecules on the pore walls and cause a super - diffusive behavior @xmath159 .",
    "we show that , even in very narrow pores , the super - diffusive gas recovery behavior can be captured quantitatively using the coupled adsorption - desorption - transport model despite its rather drastic simplification of the physical processes during gas recovery .",
    "parametric studies using the coupled adsorption - desorption - transport suggest that , at the single - pore level , super - diffusive gas recovery occurs in slit pore with width up to @xmath1145 nm if the difference between the initial pressure inside nanopore and the pressure in the large gas bath ( or equivalently large fractures ) is large .",
    "these results demonstrate that gas recovery can exhibit super - diffusive behavior at the single - nanopore level .",
    "while this behavior is observed in a highly idealized pore model , it should hold for nanopores with different shape and surface chemistry .",
    "this is because the super - diffusive scaling observed here originates from the coupled gas adsorption / desorption with gas transport inside nanopores , which is a rather generic feature of most pores in shale formations . whether the super - diffusive gas recovery at single nanopore level is the decisive factor leading to the super - diffusive gas recovery behavior observed in shale wells , however",
    ", is not clear at present .",
    "a definitive answer of this question requires simulations that take into account factors such as the polydispersity of pore sizes , the diverse chemical nature of nanopore walls , and the connectivity between pores in realistic shale formations .",
