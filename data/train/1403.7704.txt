    "the interaction of a quantum dot ( qd ) with a phonon reservoir has been studied extensively , and a number of interesting effects has been predicted .",
    "most of these studies has considered the qd consisting of a single electron - hole pair , a two - state system , and many features characteristic of two - state system , such as the mollow triplet , the autler - townes doublet and vacuum rabi splitting have been predicted and experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "recently , interest has arisen in the problem of sensitivity of a qd to the nature of a phonon bath to which it is coupled .",
    "the phonon bath serves as a low frequency reservoir and , as a result , the radiative properties of the qd change .",
    "various problems related to the temperature of the phonon bath have been studied including phonon mediated excitation transfer  @xcite , damping of rabi oscillations  @xcite , modifications of the fluorescence spectrum  @xcite , and the creation of a steady - state population inversion between the bare states of a two - level qd system  @xcite .",
    "the population inversion gives the possibility to achieve lasing in the two - level system  @xcite .    in the case of a qd ,",
    "the most important damping mechanism is a decay associated with the coupling of the qd to a finite temperature phonon bath . in general , an excited qd is expected to decay to a mixed state characteristic of conventional thermodynamic equilibrium with the population distribution that obeys a boltzmann distribution .",
    "the decay process can be modified and the nature of the equilibrium state could be different if the qd decays in a correlated reservoir , such as a squeezed vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the energy structure of a qd does not have to be confined to two levels only , that is to a single exciton state .",
    "it can be extended to include a biexciton state , which could be realized in a semiconductor qd consisting of two electron - hole pairs driven by appropriate laser pulses with the help of phonons  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the effect of a phonon thermal bath on the dynamics of a single qd modelled as a three - level system of the cascade configuration .",
    "in addition to the phonon bath , the qd is driven by a single laser field which couples to both transitions of the cascade system . using the master equation approach ,",
    "we calculate the steady - state populations of the energy levels , transient behaviours of the populations and the radiation intensity , nonclassical features such as squeezing and antibunching .",
    "we show that the phonon bath couples to the upper transition of the cascade system as a broadband reservoir of _ inverted _ harmonic oscillators , which serves as a linear amplifier to the system  @xcite .",
    "this causes the phonon bath to behave as a correlated rather than the conventional thermal reservoir , which may lead to many interesting features such as one and two - photon population inversions , squeezing , super - bunching and anti - bunching . even though the interaction of the qd with the phonon reservoir is a dissipative process ,",
    "we demonstrate that the reservoir can turn the system to decay to a strongly correlated state .",
    "depending on the temperature of the reservoir , the correlated steady state of the qd can be a pure state which reflects these correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the effective hamiltonian of the quantum dot interacting with a phonon bath is derived .",
    "we then apply the hamiltonian to derive the master equation for the reduced density operator describing the properties of the quantum dot interacting with the phonon bath .",
    "we also include a possible coupling of the quantum dot to the ordinary vacuum modes that leads to the radiative spontaneous emission .",
    "the steady - state population distributions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , along with a discussion of one and two - photon inversions . squeezing and the second - order coherence function are calculated in sec .",
    "a detailed discussion of the transient behaviour of the system is presented in sec .",
    "we find that the temporal behaviour of the population distribution and the radiation intensity may differ dramatically for different initial conditions .",
    "the effect of the ordinary spontaneous emission on the features induced by the phonon bath is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] , we summarize our results .",
    "we consider a quantum dot modelled as a non - degenerate three - level cascade system with the ground level  @xmath0 , the intermediate level @xmath1 and the upper level @xmath2 of energies @xmath3 .",
    "the levels are separated by energies @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in practical terms",
    ", the level @xmath0 corresponds to the electronic ground state of the qd , the level @xmath1 to the single - exciton state , and @xmath2 to the biexciton state .",
    "the system is driven by a single - mode laser field of frequency  @xmath6 , which is resonant with a two - photon transition from @xmath2 to @xmath0 , @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . because of the unequal spacing of the energy levels , the laser is not resonant with the one - photon transitions .",
    "in addition , the system interacts with modes of a low frequency ( acoustic ) phonon reservoir , which we assume are in a thermal state with the average occupation phonon number of a mode @xmath8 , @xmath9^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath11 is the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "the density of the phonon modes is considered to be large only in the frequency range close to the detuning @xmath12 of the laser frequency from the transition frequency @xmath13 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we are therefore led to the conclusion that the effect of the spontaneous emission on the population inversions and squeezing is not dramatic that these features should be observed as long as @xmath14 , that is , when the spontaneous emission rates are smaller than the rates associated with the coupling of the quantum dot to the phonon bath . in practical terms",
    "it would correspond to the situation where the majority of the modes with which the quantum dot interacts is occupied by the phonon modes .",
    "we have studied the effect of a low frequency ( acoustic ) phonon bath on the dynamics of a quantum dot modelled as a three - level system in a cascade configuration .",
    "the phonon bath forms a broadband multimode thermal reservoir to the quantum dot . we have found that the phonon bath couples to the upper transition of the three - level system as an inverted harmonic oscillator that it serves as a linear amplifier to the system , and thereby gives rise to unusual features in the dynamics of the quantum dot .",
    "one of these features is the decay of the system to a correlated two - photon state with the population distribution no longer obeying a boltzmann distribution .",
    "we have also found that the radiation field emitted by the quantum dot may exhibit significant squeezing and strong two - photon correlations .",
    "these effects are intrinsically connected to a pure two - photon state to which the system decays under the influence of the phonon bath .",
    "we have calculated the radiation intensity and have shown that the correlations induced by the phonon bath are manifested in the presence of quantum beats in the time evolution of the radiation intensity .",
    "finally , we have included the ordinary spontaneous emission due to the coupling of the quantum dot to vacuum modes different than that occupied by the phonon modes , and have found that the effect of the spontaneous emission on the unusual features is not dramatic . the population inversions and squeezing should be observed as long as the spontaneous emission damping rates are smaller than the rates associated with the interaction of the quantum dot with the phonon bath .",
