    "this is easily understood from a field - theoretic point of view .",
    "when ads extends to infinity we have a continuum of @xmath35dimensional particles which generates branch cuts in the effective action seen by an observer located on the @xmath15 brane .",
    "these non - local terms are crucial since they reproduce the correlation functions of the cft at non - coincident points .",

    "the physics on the @xmath15 brane does not depend on the @xmath16 brane . in this case",
    "( see appendix ) the coupling @xmath45 is a function of @xmath63 only : it is at its fixed point .",
    "in other words , choosing the brane coupling at the fixed point ( [ fixedpoint ] ) is equivalent , from the point of view of an observer living on the @xmath15 brane , to removing the @xmath16 brane to infinity . in the appendix",
    "we show that the flow equation ( [ flowequation ] ) has in general a line of fixed points , but these correspond to solutions of the wave - equation which are not regular at infinity , so they are rejected .",

    "on the other hand , the @xmath16 brane modifies the space only at large @xmath14 so naively it corresponds , in the holographic picture , to breaking ( spontaneously ) conformal invariance in the infrared , at a scale @xmath19 .",

    "it is straightforward , even for higher - point functions , to compute the zero momentum dependence of the coupling @xmath102 .",
    "the leading dependence on the external momentum is also not hard to compute .",
    "since the @xmath16 brane breaks conformal invariance in the infrared , the brane couplings are not at a fixed point , but acquire an explicit dependence on the scale @xmath43 .    in the case of the @xmath21point function , equation ( [ flowequation ] ) can be solved explicitly , the solution being : @xmath103 the integration constant @xmath104 is determined by the boundary condition at the @xmath16 brane , namely @xmath105 .",

    "the expansion is now completely polynomial in momentum .",
    "technically this happens because if the boundary condition is local , this property will be preserved by the flow . from the cft point of view , this fact is simply the statement that below the scale @xmath19 , conformal symmetry is completely broken , and in particular , a mass gap is generated .",
    "on the ads side we have a discrete set of @xmath110 particles whose mass scale is set by @xmath19 . , i.e. tachyons satisfying the lower bound on the masses of scalars in ads@xmath4 , the kk spectrum also contains a single tachyon whose mass squared is @xmath111 @xcite . ] this discrete set of particles gives rise to isolated poles in the propagator but no branch cuts .",

    "we call these solutions fixed points because the couplings in the expansion of @xmath54 are independent on @xmath43 in this case . from ( [ fpapp ] ) we see that the flow equation has a line of fixed points depending on the ratio @xmath142 ( with @xmath142 independent of @xmath46 ) . setting @xmath54 at a fixed point is physically equivalent , for an observer living on the @xmath15 brane , to removing the @xmath16 brane to infinity",
    ". regularity at infinity selects the wave - function @xmath61 so the relevant fixed point corresponds to @xmath143 .    for illustrative purposes we now show an alternative method to compute the fixed points of ( [ flowapp ] ) .",
    "the same technique could be used to solve the equations for the higher order couplings or to study the @xmath21point functions in backgrounds which are only asymptotically ads .",
    "equation ( [ flowapp ] ) can be solved iteratively expanding in powers of @xmath46 .",
    "notice that for the fixed points the momentum expansion is the same as the expansion around @xmath144 , that is a near boundary analysis . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider the case of @xmath67 integer which is the most common in the string theory literature .",
    "we start with the following ansatz for the solution : @xmath145 substituting in the flow equation we obtain a set of coupled differential equations for the coefficients @xmath146 : @xmath147 for the fixed points all the derivatives are equal to zero so we have a set of algebraic equations .",
    "the solution of the first equation in ( [ flowexpapp ] ) is : @xmath148 the solution with the @xmath149 sign corresponds to the fixed point with @xmath136 only .",
    "this solution has an expansion purely polynomial in momentum . in position space",
    "this generates only contact interactions . with the choice of the @xmath150 sign we can solve ( [ flowexpapp ] ) iteratively only up to the order @xmath151",
    "this equation is inconsistent . in order to find a solution we need to include a term @xmath152 in the expansion of @xmath54 .",
    "now the equation @xmath153 determines the coefficient @xmath69 while @xmath154 remains unconstrained .",
    "the fact that @xmath154 is undetermined is of course related to possibility of choosing @xmath142 in ( [ fpapp ] ) .",
