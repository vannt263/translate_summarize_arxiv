    "group manifolds have widely been used as a playground to study string theory in non - trivial , curved backgrounds . for compact groups , the conformal field theory ( cft ) on the world - sheet is rational and completely under control .",
    "d - branes in these backgrounds have been investigated using boundary conformal field theory and semi - classical methods .",
    "it might surprise that despite all the progress that has been made in understanding branes on group manifolds , there are usually not enough d - branes known to explain the whole charge group predicted by ( twisted ) k - theory .",
    "soon after the essential role of ( twisted ) k - theory for the description of decay processes of d - branes was pointed out in @xcite there have been attempts to explain the k - groups for group manifolds using boundary renormalisation group flow ideas . in this way the k - groups for @xmath2 and @xmath3 could be understood completely  @xcite . in the case of @xmath2",
    "the only type of charge is associated with cardy branes @xcite while for @xmath3 there also exists a second type of charge which could be assigned to twisted branes @xcite .",
    "both classes of branes are maximally symmetric .",
    "later the k - groups have been calculated in a purely mathematical manner @xcite . according to these results the number of charges grows exponentially with the rank of the ( simple ) group @xmath4 , but this exceeds the different types of maximally symmetric branes by far . although there are some ideas what the branes carrying the remaining charges could be ( see  @xcite for a proposal for @xmath5 based on the symmetry breaking branes of  @xcite ) , it is fair to say that a satisfactory answer is still missing .    a simple example where one can hope to resolve the mismatch and explain the complete charge group is the wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wznw ) model on the product group @xmath1 .",
    "this theory has two parameters , the levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which control the size and the h - field of the background .",
    "the corresponding k - theory is twisted by the third cohomology class @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the generators of the third integer cohomology group of the two factors .",
    "it is given by ( see appendix  [ app : ktheory ] ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the greatest common divisor of the two levels .",
    "one summand in   belongs to @xmath13-branes and can readily be explained by factorising cardy branes ; the charge relations derived from boundary renormalisation group flows as in  @xcite produce the correct order @xmath14 of the charge group .",
    "the other summand corresponds to a three - dimensional cycle with vanishing integrated h - flux .",
    "when the two levels are equal , this cycle is wrapped by permutation branes  @xcite ( see also @xcite for more specific examples ) .",
    "the existence of the latter relies on an order-2 automorphism of the affine lie algebra @xmath15 which interchanges the two factors .",
    "if the levels are different , no such automorphism exists , and there is no obvious cft construction of d - branes corresponding to the second summand in the k - group .",
    "let us nevertheless emphasise that we are in a special situation where the mismatch between k - theory and the known d - branes is cured for a particular choice of parameters ( @xmath16 ) and one can hope that this coincidence provides some hints regarding the appropriate construction of the missing branes for an arbitrary choice of the levels .    following this reasoning we give a proposal for the branes that explain the missing charges . instead of using the established constructions for symmetry breaking branes symmetry down to the coset @xmath17 and @xmath18 and then perform a twist in the @xmath18 part , but the corresponding branes seem to have the wrong topology to explain the charges .",
    "] , we are directly led by the geometry of the branes that we expect from k - theory .",
    "we suggest the existence of `` generalised permutation branes '' in products @xmath0 of lie groups with different levels .",
    "the geometry of the simplest new brane is given by @xmath19 it represents a @xmath20-dimensional submanifold with vanishing total h - flux and reduces to the geometry of an ordinary permutation brane if @xmath21 .",
    "this brane has higher - dimensional cousins which are stabilised by a non - trivial f - field .",
    "they are described in section  [ sc : genpermbranes ] .    to support our proposal",
    "we derive the world - sheet lagrangian and employ semi - classical target space methods ( dirac - born - infeld ) .",
    "the branes are not maximally symmetric , but the symmetry of the diagonally embedded group @xmath4 is still conserved . for given levels , there are only finitely many generalised permutation branes .",
    "their number coincides with the number of untwisted maximally symmetric branes in a single group factor @xmath4 with level @xmath22 , the least common multiple of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the case of @xmath1",
    "we also analyse tensions and charges of the new branes .",
    "the relative tensions are controlled by the modular s - matrix of a single @xmath25-model with level @xmath26 .",
    "stability considerations indicate that the charge of the branes is conserved modulo @xmath12 which is in perfect agreement with the k - theory result .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the @xmath27-model on a world - sheet with boundaries . after a short introduction into wznw models ,",
    "we formulate the geometry of our proposed generalised permutation branes in the product group @xmath0 and give an expression for the boundary two - form living on them .",
    "then the quantisation condition which leads to a discrete brane spectrum is discussed and it is shown that the branes preserve the diagonal @xmath4-symmetry .",
    "section 3 concentrates on the case of @xmath28 .",
    "first we analyse the geometry of the branes in detail and show that only a subset of the world volumes avoid self - intersections and can be considered stable .",
    "the instability of the other branes reproduces the expected charge group including its torsion . in the following we discuss the effective dirac - born - infeld description .",
    "it is shown that the proposed branes satisfy the equations of motions , partly using numerical methods . also the tensions and the open string spectrum",
    "are analysed numerically .",
    "section 4 generalises some of the results of section 3 to higher rank groups .",
    "a summary and a discussion of open problems and future directions conclude the paper .",
    "in particular , we comment on a possible extension of our results to cosets where generalised permutation branes recently appeared in the rather complementary approach of matrix factorisations in the topological subsector of products of @xmath29 minimal models @xcite .",
    "two appendices contain the computation of the relevant k - groups and the technical details of the dbi calculations .",

    "the integrality of the wess - zumino form and unitarity of the ( minkowskian version of the ) theory imposes the constraint that the levels @xmath50 are non - negative integers .      in each group",

    "they have later been shown to wrap twisted conjugacy classes @xcite @xmath52 these submanifolds admit an obvious action of @xmath30 which corresponds to the affine symmetry preserved in the boundary cft .",
    "let us now focus on the product group @xmath46 .",
    "it can easily be understood that there are maximally symmetric branes which completely factorise .",
    "they correspond to automorphisms which may be written as a product of automorphisms . on the other hand",
    "the group @xmath30 also admits the permutation automorphism @xmath53 the associated twisted conjugacy classes have the form @xmath54 and one might believe that they are good candidates for branes .",
    "this assertion is certainly true for @xmath21 .",
    "whenever the two levels disagree , however , the permutation automorphism @xmath55 does not leave the metric invariant and can not be lifted to an automorphism of the affine lie algebra @xmath56 which underlies the wznw model .",
    "we thus conclude that the twisted conjugacy classes just describe the loci of branes if @xmath21 .",
    "the main result of our paper is that a slight modification of the geometry actually gives rise to proper d - branes even for @xmath57 . to be more concrete ,",
    "we propose that the submanifold @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , is the locus of a _ generalised permutation brane _ if we impose suitable quantisation conditions on the constant @xmath61 which may be chosen from a fixed maximal torus @xmath62 .",
    "obviously , this geometry reduces to the twisted conjugacy class whenever the two levels coincide . in general the dimension of the branes",
    "is @xmath63 but for certain degenerate values of @xmath61 it will have a lower value . in particular",
    "if @xmath61 equals the identity element @xmath64 , the expression simplifies to @xmath65 in this case the dimension is given by @xmath66 .",
    "since the constants @xmath67 are relatively prime , there is a one - to - one correspondence between elements of @xmath68 and elements of @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for the occurrence of the non - trivial exponents @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the definition becomes immediately obvious if we remember that we have to find a boundary two - form @xmath44 which trivialises the wess - zumino form on the brane . repeatedly applying the polyakov - wiegmann identity",
    "@xmath71 one can easily prove @xmath72 here , @xmath73 denotes the adjoint action of the group element @xmath33 on @xmath74 .",
    "if we instead consider the total wess - zumino form @xmath75 and restrict it to the submanifold , one realises that the constants @xmath67 have been chosen in a way such that the terms which can not be written as a total derivative cancel out . as a consequence",

    "if in addition the two levels coincide , the boundary two - form vanishes identically .",
    "let us finally comment on the symmetries of our generalised permutation branes .",
    "we already mentioned that the branes are maximally symmetric in the case of equal levels @xmath78 , i.e.  they preserve the current algebra @xmath79 . on the geometric side this corresponds to the invariance of the brane world volume under the two different twisted adjoint actions @xmath80 for @xmath57 , however , the world volumes and are not invariant anymore under this action of @xmath0 because of the non - trivial exponents @xmath67 .",
    "instead they only admit an action of the diagonal subgroup @xmath81 in that case .",
    "we thus expect that the affine symmetry is at least broken down to @xmath82 .",
    "in fact we will argue in section [ sc : gluing ] that this smaller symmetry is indeed conserved .. since the central charge of the diagonal current algebra @xmath82 is not sufficient , there also has to be an additional symmetry including a virasoro algebra with the remaining central charge .",
    "so far we could not identify this additional symmetry but according to our geometric arguments it will quite certainly not be of affine type . ]    we conclude that generalised permutation branes provide a new , geometrically motivated , class of symmetry breaking d - branes .",
    "in particular we wish to emphasise that the non - maximally symmetric branes constructed in @xcite have a geometrical interpretation which is very distinct from .",
    "in addition , those branes also exist for @xmath21 and certainly do not coincide with ordinary permutation branes in that case .      in the previous section we described the geometry of generalised permutation branes .",
    "the branes are labelled by an element @xmath61 of the cartan torus of @xmath4 . as always for branes in wznw models",
    ", there is a quantisation condition which restricts the possible values of @xmath61 to a discrete set .",
    "it arises from an ambiguity in the lagrangian description whenever the brane geometry has a non - trivial two - cycle ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "namely , the action @xmath83 in   depends on how the map @xmath33 is continued from @xmath31 to the whole @xmath84 .",
    "the ambiguity takes the form @xmath85 for a three dimensional ball @xmath86 , whose boundary @xmath87 is mapped into the brane . to make the path integral",
    "well defined , @xmath88 has to be a multiple of @xmath45 . in other words ,",
    "the f - field @xmath89 ( where @xmath40 is a two - form such that @xmath90 ) must have quantised flux through any two - sphere embedded into the brane  @xcite .    in  @xcite the quantisation condition",
    "has been worked out for untwisted branes in arbitrary compact simple simply - connected lie groups  @xmath4 .",
    "the allowed branes are localised on conjugacy classes @xmath91 of elements @xmath92 in the cartan torus where @xmath93 is an integral weight of @xmath94 .",
    "the generalised permutation branes @xmath95 in the product group are described by an immersion of @xmath96 into @xmath0 , @xmath97 ignoring possible self - intersections ( see section  [ sc : intersections ] ) , the only non - trivial two - cycles in the brane come from the conjugacy class @xmath98 .",
    "so we can restrict our analysis to the submanifold @xmath99 which is embedded in @xmath0 as @xmath100 . on this conjugacy class",
    "the boundary two - form @xmath101 restricts to the usual two - form of untwisted branes in a single copy of @xmath4 with level @xmath24 .",
    "employing the result  , we find that @xmath102 can take the quantised values @xmath103 , i.e.  @xmath61 is restricted to @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the least common multiple of the levels @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the number of generalised permutation branes thus coincides with the number of untwisted branes in a single copy of @xmath4 with level @xmath26 .",
    "surprisingly enough this suggests that the exact cft description will be based on a _ rational _ conformal subalgebra of the bulk symmetry @xmath56 and gives a severe restriction on the complete set of symmetries of the brane .      to better understand the new branes",

    "one of the main results was an explicit map between initial and final boundary conditions along the flow .",
    "we hope that also the deformation of ordinary permutation branes in @xmath332 can be analysed in the same spirit if we perturb the model towards @xmath333 .",
    "the major complication compared to the case of a single minimal model is that the final brane will probably not preserve the whole symmetry @xmath333 .",
    "let us finally comment on one of the big unsolved problems in cft : the full classification of ( super)conformal boundary conditions for a given background .",
    "only partial results in this direction are available up to now @xcite",
    ". a detailed knowledge about the cft construction of generalised permutation branes in product groups and cosets would certainly be a major step forward .",
    "in this paper it turned out to be extremely fruitful to accept the guidance of geometric and k - theoretic arguments and probably this will also be the case for other branes of particular physical significance .",
    "eventually , new insights into the classification of branes or into the brane charges in certain backgrounds could be gained by combining the nested coset construction of branes @xcite with generalised permutations in common subfactors .",
