    "mesoscopic devices have made it possible to investigate many - body effect in transport phenomena .",
    "a bias voltage applied to a conductor drives the system into a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "these systems thus offer promising opportunities to study the correlated transport out of equilibrium .",
    "shot noise has been introduced to explore nonequilibrium nature in these systems @xcite .",
    "originally shot noise was given by the zero temperature value of noise power @xmath7 defined by the current - current correlation function .",
    "it is well known that , if uncorrelated particles with charge @xmath8 rarely transmit through a conductor , shot noise is given by the poisson value @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the current .",
    "therefore in this case , the quantity @xmath11 has a possibility to determine the unit of charge carriers @xmath8 , extracted from not only the current @xcite . in literature , this result is specific to a low transparent conductor without correlation effects .",
    "however , the possibility of shot noise has stimulated recent studies in other systems , for instance , correlated systems .",
    "there , the ratio @xmath11 has been estimated as an indication of effective  charge  . as a successful example to give a true quasiparticle charge , the fractional charge @xmath12 in the fractional quantum hall regime",
    "was determined through @xmath11@xcite .",
    "shot noise defined by the noise power has been useful to reveal attractive features at low temperatures .",
    "extension of the concept of the shot noise at finite temperatures may open new possibilities out , however , how do we define shot noise at finite temperatures ?    to illustrate the problem we take a quantum dot system as a stringent example@xcite . in the noninteracting case ,",
    "noise power splits into thermal noise @xmath13 and shot noise @xmath14 as @xmath15 at any temperature @xcite , where @xmath16 is the bare transmission probability .",
    "the fact enables us to define the shot noise as @xmath17 at any temperature and any bias voltage . with correlation effects ,",
    "noise power is obtained as @xmath18 .",
    "if the effect of coulomb interaction may be included by simply changing @xmath16 to the full transmission probability @xmath19 , noise power would be expressed as @xmath20 . shot noise",
    "thus could be defined in the same way as the uncorrelated system .",
    "however , an additional term of @xmath21 contributes to @xmath7 . from the expression of @xmath21 , it is not possible to split it into the thermal - noise part and the shot - noise part .",
    "thus in a quantum dot system it has not been possible to extract shot noise from the noise power . until this point",
    ", we have stated the problem for a quantum dot system . however , the problem to define shot noise in correlated systems is a general one , not limited to the quantum dot system .",
    "recently we have succeeded in extending a theory of keldysh formalism for mesoscopic systems , and thus provided a basis for the definition of shot noise at any temperature .    in this study , we have focused on a group of mesoscopic systems , typically designed as a correlated conductor attached to extended reservoirs through tunnel barriers .",
    "we have specifically examined the density matrix of the keldysh formalism @xcite for these systems @xcite . an attempt to obtain",
    "an explicit expression of the density matrix had been already made in refs .. however , this attempt was not fully successful , since the density matrix still contained infinite series of operators which arose from the formal expansion of the s - matrix . summing up them , we have thus proven that the density matrix has a form proposed by maclennan and zubarev @xcite .",
    "this type of density matrix was also derived by using a @xmath22 algebra@xcite .",
    "the resulting density matrix allows us to derive a general expression of differential conductance : @xmath23 , where @xmath7 is the current - current correlation function , and @xmath0 is the non - trivial current - charge correlation function and @xmath24@xcite",
    ". we will call it the _ nonequilibrium kubo formula_. furthermore , the density matrix has made it possible to prove that a steady state is realized , and describe the issue of irreversible processes in keldysh formalism .",
    "therefore our theory gives a unified description of desirable features in mesoscopic systems out of equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the nonequilibrium kubo formula allows us to introduce a natural definition of the shot noise in correlated systems .",
    "in fact the current - current correlation function @xmath7 is noise power , and of course @xmath25 is differential conductance . with these observable quantities ,",
    "the nonequilibrium kubo formula is written into @xmath26 , and thus we propose the current - charge correlation function @xmath0 as the new definition of the shot noise . this concept has been confirmed in a noninteracting quantum dot by explicitly calculating @xmath7 , @xmath25 and the new formula @xmath0 with the keldysh green function . the resulting relation among physical quantities",
    "is called as the _ nonequilibrium identity_. thus we can compare theoretically calculated @xmath0 at a certain temperature with @xmath27 determined from @xmath7 and @xmath25 measured in experiments . therefore , the nonequilibrium kubo formula makes it possible to give a new perspective on studies of shot noise at any temperature in correlated systems . @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to apply this new approach to the quantum dot system in the kondo regime by analyzing shot noise at low bias voltages .",
    "first , we briefly sketch recent studies of shot noise in the kondo regime . in these studies",
    "shot noise is defined by the noise power @xmath7 at zero temperature .",
    "theoretically shot noise was investigated in the s - d limit@xcite .",
    "when a bias voltage @xmath28 is larger than the kondo temperature @xmath29 , with decreasing the bias voltage shot noise increases logarithmically as is well known in the kondo systems . close to the unitarity limit of @xmath30 , shot noise is suppressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the resonance widths between dot and left and right leads .",
    "the fermi - liquid fixed point hamiltonian @xmath33 @xcite is used in calculations .    in recent",
    "studies@xcite , the fermi - liquid features in eq.([in1 ] ) have been reexamined at zero temperature .",
    "the fixed point hamiltonian is characterized by a one - particle scattering and a two - particle scattering .",
    "they give corrections to the @xmath34 phase shift in the unitarity limit : a frequency - liner phase shift and a quasiparticle - distribution - linear phase shift .    as a result",
    ", a current @xmath35 describes a reduction from the perfect transmission for the @xmath34 phase shift in the unitarity limit , which is the definition of the backscattering current in refs .. here @xmath36 express particle - number operators in left and right leads and @xmath37 is the heisenberg representation for an operator @xmath38 .    at zero temperature",
    ", the observable current is defined by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the current in the unitarity limit . since @xmath41 becomes a constant value , noise power given by the current - current correlation function",
    "is rewritten as @xmath42 therefore the shot noise is determined by only the backscattering current when @xmath30 .",
    "on the basis of this fact , using @xmath43 , it has been attempted to estimate an effective  charge  for the backscattering current@xcite . in the present work",
    "we will discuss the fano factor @xmath44 in units of charge @xmath45    in ref .",
    ", the symmetric case @xmath46 is especially focused on .",
    "this condition makes the leading order of @xmath7 in the bias voltage @xmath47 as in eq.([in1 ] ) .",
    "then , the leading order of @xmath1 also becomes @xmath47 . in the symmetric case , @xmath44 results in a universal fractional value up to @xmath47 @xmath48",
    "it has been pointed out that this universal enhancement from the unity originates from the two - particle backscattering .",
    "this universal feature has stimulated further studies : in the context of the full counting statistics@xcite this result has been reproduced , and a shot - noise measurement has been reported on @xmath49 close to the unitarity limit at low bias voltages@xcite .",
    "we address this topic from our point of view .    in this paper ,",
    "we begin with a brief review of the generalization of the kubo formula into a nonequilibrium situation and shot noise in sec.[review ] . in sec.[shkqd ] applying our new concept to a quantum dot system described by the anderson model , we investigate the shot noise and the fano factor in the kondo regime .",
    "we concentrate on the symmetric case at zero temperature . at zero temperature",
    "the nonequilibrium kubo formula yields @xmath50 .",
    "thus , using the renormalized perturbation theory , we calculate noise power @xmath7 and shot noise @xmath0 independently up to the leading order for the symmetric case : @xmath47 and show that they are identical .",
    "the backscattering current is also calculated up to @xmath47 .",
    "finally we will discuss the universal feature of the fano factor for any coulomb interaction up to @xmath47 .",
    "we start with a brief summary of shot noise and the nonequilibrium kubo formula based on keldysh formalism for mesoscopic systems in nonequilibrium steady states@xcite .",
    "our starting point is the hamiltonian for a class of mesoscopic systems : a correlated conductor @xmath51 attached to left and right infinite reservoirs @xmath52 through boundary couplings @xmath53 .",
    "for instance a quantum dot system is a typical example of them .",
    "the hamiltonian is described as @xmath54 @xmath51 is given by noninteracting and interacting terms as @xmath55 .",
    "each reservoir must be sufficiently large to behave as a good thermal bath . in a conventional explanation of keldysh formalism",
    ", it seems that concepts such as the keldysh contour , and the keldysh green function are stressed@xcite .",
    "in contrast , our main argument is to examine the early stage of keldysh formalism where the perturbation term is adiabatically turned on .    to begin with",
    ", we divide @xmath33 into an unperturbed term @xmath56 and a perturbation term @xmath57 @xcite . to adiabatically introduce the perturbation term",
    ", we use a time - dependent hamiltonian as @xmath58 .",
    "the initial state at @xmath59 is determined by the three separated systems in @xmath60 : left and right reservoirs and the conductor which have different chemical potentials @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "we define a bias voltage as @xmath63 and an averaged chemical potential @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is assumed .",
    "the origin of energy is set to @xmath66 . as a result",
    "the initial density matrix is given by @xmath67 @xmath68=0 $ ] is assumed throughout .",
    "the initial thermodynamic potential is chosen to satisfy @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath71 is determined by the neumann equation . with @xmath71 ,",
    "the expectation value of any operator @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 .",
    "it is transformed as @xmath74 where the heisenberg representation is given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    here in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "we comment on the time dependence of the expectation value .",
    "it is determined by only the heisenberg representation of an operator @xmath77 as shown in the right - hand side of eq.([exv ] ) .",
    "concerning the density matrix , it is sufficient to consider @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "we thus consider a specific time of @xmath79 , but until this point we do not use any assumption either the steady state is realized at @xmath79 or not . after taking a limit of @xmath80 ,",
    "the system reaches a steady state .",
    "later we will return back to this point in sec.[invariant ] .",
    "we thus focus on the density matrix @xmath81 which is given by a formal solution of the neumann equation @xmath82 using the unitarity of @xmath83 , @xmath84 becomes @xmath85 to proceed calculations , we have to compute a type of quantity @xmath86 we have two cases in our mind : @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where we suppose that @xmath38 satisfies @xmath89=0 $ ] . the critical step in calculations is to derive @xcite @xmath90 the `` current '' for the operator @xmath38 is defined as @xmath91 technically eq.([adiabatic ] ) is sufficient to calculate the density matrix .",
    "however , we shortly discuss eq.([adiabatic ] ) , leading to deeper understanding of the nonequilibrium nature in keldysh formalism .",
    "integration by parts in eq.([adiabatic ] ) yields @xmath92 thus @xmath93 expresses a long - time average of @xmath38 in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , @xmath93 defined by eq.([adiabatic2 ] ) represents nothing but the invariant part of an operator @xmath38 , introduced by zubarev@xcite . we have thus proven that the adiabatic introduction of @xmath94 in keldysh formalism corresponds to taking the invariant part by zubarev .",
    "we revisit this concept to discuss steady states and irreversible processes in sec.[invariant ] .",
    "we use eq.([adiabatic ] ) in two cases : @xmath87 and @xmath95 where the `` currents '' are defined by energy change @xmath96 and charge current @xmath97 using eq.([fcurrent ] ) , respectively . substituting them into eq.([formal ] )",
    "yields @xmath98 the density matrix of keldysh formalism thus becomes a type of the nonequilibrium statistical operators initiated by maclennan and zubarev@xcite .",
    "this form was also obtained by the @xmath22 algebra@xcite .",
    "the resultant density matrix makes it possible to generalize the kubo formula for conductance into a nonequilibrium steady state . for convenience , in this work we introduce a bra - ket notation : @xmath99 .",
    "the current is thus denoted as @xmath100 where in the last equality of eq.([recurrent ] ) , a steady - state feature later proved in sec.[invariant ] is used . from the current , differential conductance",

    "away from the linear response regime , the current - current correlation function gives a naive extension from the relation between fluctuation and dissipation .",
    "on the other hand , the current - charge correlation function gives an intriguing modification far from the linear response regime . in conclusion",

    ". eq.([shsg ] ) then goes back to the nyquist - johnson relation @xmath129 . on the other hand , at zero temperature eq.([shsg ] ) shows that @xmath0 indeed equals to @xmath7 at @xmath130 which is nothing but the original definition of the shot noise .",
    "having discussed consequence of the density matrix on the transport property : the nonequilibrium kubo formula and shot noise , here we turn to others : irreversible processes and steady states in keldysh formalism .",

    "we turn to @xmath0 proposed as the new formula of shot noise . up to the leading order in @xmath102 , @xmath334 and @xmath335",

    ", we would like to argue the fano factor @xmath337 conventionally , noise power @xmath7 at zero temperature is treated as shot noise . however , we have proposed @xmath0 as shot noise at any temperature based on the nonequilibrium kubo formula .",

    "@xmath1 expresses the backscattering current @xcite @xmath338 the @xmath10 in eq.([current2 ] ) gives an expression of @xmath339 @xmath340 the backscattering current @xmath339 just corresponds to @xmath301 for the bubble - diagrams in eq.([ash1 ] ) : @xmath341 for @xmath342 .",
    "consequently @xmath343 .",
    "using expressions of @xmath313 for the vertex diagrams in eq.([ash2 ] ) and @xmath339 in eq.([f2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath336 @xmath344 the first term in @xmath336 originates from @xmath301 .",
    "@xmath301 is characterized by only @xmath262 .",
    "if correlation effect gives only a change from the bare @xmath16 to the full @xmath262 , @xmath345 would hold within @xmath47 .",
    "actually , @xmath313 from the vertex - diagrams contributes to @xmath336 . as a result it gives an enhancement factor of the second term in eq.([f3 ] ) .",
    "the vertex - diagram is known to describe a kind of the back - flow effect .",
    "the back - flow effect enhances the fano factor for backscattering current .",
    "the form of the enhancement in @xmath336 has a universal feature that only the wilson ratio determines it for any @xmath150 .",
    "here we check the resulting @xmath336 in the limit of @xmath346 and @xmath347 .",

    "therefore @xmath336 given by eq.([f3 ] ) is an extension for any @xmath150 from the already obtained value of @xmath6 in the s - d limit .    before closing discussion",
    ", we touch on an application of @xmath336 . by using @xmath336 , we may determine the wilson ratio directly from experiments as follows , @xmath349",
    "the nonequilibrium kubo formula @xmath26 allows us to propose @xmath0 as the new definition of shot noise in general .",
    "experimentally measured @xmath27 can be compared with a theoretical prediction of @xmath0 at any temperature .",
    "therefore , the nonequilibrium kubo formula thus opens a new approach to studies of shot noise in correlated systems at any temperature and any bias voltage .",
    "then , using this approach shot noise through a quantum dot in the kondo regime has been investigated . for simplicity",
    ", the symmetric case has been discussed at zero temperature . at @xmath130 ,",
    "the nonequilibrium kubo formula gives @xmath350 .",
    "we have thus analyzed both @xmath7 and @xmath0 , up to @xmath47 which is the leading order in @xmath102 for the symmetric case . the renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt )",
    "has enabled us to obtain the exact asymptotic form of @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "both of @xmath7 and @xmath0 are expressed by two - particle green functions .",
    "thus they have two types of contributions from the bubble - diagrams and the vertex - diagrams as @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "it has been shown @xmath351 and @xmath352 up to @xmath47 .",
    "we have concluded that @xmath0 indeed equals @xmath7 at @xmath130 which was conventionally defined as shot noise .",
    "finally we have pointed out that @xmath353 from the vertex - diagrams leads to the universal enhancement factor in the fano factor : @xmath3 .",
    "this expression includes the result of @xmath6 in the kondo limit by using the wilson ratio @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , we have found that @xmath248 splits into the thermal - noise part and the shot - noise part with the full transmission probability @xmath19 . here",
    ", let us recall the fact of @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , @xmath354 .",
    "thus , @xmath21 describes nothing but the contribution from the vertex - diagrams : @xmath355 . as discussed previously , concerning @xmath21 it is not clear whether noise power @xmath7 at a general temperature is split into the thermal - noise part and the shot - noise part .",
    "however , it is impossible to ignore the effect of @xmath21 , even at zero temperature because @xmath356 is always relevant as in the universal enhancement factor in @xmath336 .",
