    "az cas and vv cep are eclipsing binary stars with one of the longest orbital periods ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 years , respectively ) .",
    "they both belong to vv cep type  systems , consisting of a m or late k supergiant and an early b star , and have spectra exhibiting strong balmer and @xmath3 $ ] emission lines @xcite .",
    "the presence of an intensive mass loss gives us an opportunity to study the accretion processes .",
    "the most recent , 1997 eclipse of vv cep occured by about @xmath0 of the orbital period later than predicted @xcite , perhaps as a result of mass loss and/or mass transfer .",
    "the behaviour of both systems seems to have the same cause , connected with strong interactions between the components close to periastron phase and it can influence on times of minima due to changes in the orbital parameters .",
    "multicolor photometry of the last az cas eclipse was obtained with a 60 cm reflector at piwnice observatory ( poland ) .",
    "our _ ubvr _ light curves are presented in the figure  1 ( top ) phased together with photometric data from other observatories .",
    "our _ bvr _ photometry after the eclipse shows an increase of the brightness by a few @xmath4 of magnitude during @xmath5 days .",
    "this effect was commented by @xcite , and as a first approximation it can be interpreted as effect of tidal distortion of the cool component surface around the periastron .",
    "nevertheless , our observations are made also in phases which have never been covered with multicolor photometry before .",
    "for example , the long atmospheric eclipse in _ u _ bandpass ( up to @xmath6 phase ) seems to indicate , that the cool component is surrounded by an extended envelope formed by its own stellar wind .",
    "the hot component could accrete gas from the wind and the matter transfered through the l@xmath7 point by the cool giant roche lobe overflow near the periastron . in the out of eclipse data ( the phase range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) we have observed very interesting variability with smallest amplitude in _",
    "bandpass , and much stronger in the _ u _ and in _ u - b _ color index .",
    "the color indices evolution ( figure  1inner  box ) can not be explained at this time , and we can only assume , that this is connected with accretion of material which was lost by supergiant near the periastron passage and with cooling of supergiant atmosphere .",
    "the vv cep system has been observed in piwnice observatory for @xmath10 years .",
    "the collected _ ubv _ light curves are presented in the figure  1 ( bottom pannel ) . especially strong variations in the _ u _ bandpass can be attributed to mass accretion on the hot component , as they disappear during the eclipse .",
    "the delay of the last eclipse event could occur , as the result of changes in orbital parameters ( perhaps @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) due to interaction and mass loss / transfer near the periastron passage in the previous epoch .",
    "@xcite suggested that the spectral type of the cool component can vary with the orbital phase . around the periastron phases ,",
    "the cool component can look like a k supergiant ( e.g. : k3.8ib / iab @xcite ) and perhaps even close to f type during the eclipse ( f8ib @xcite ) . in most cases",
    "the cool component is classified as m type supergiant ( e.g. : m0ib @xcite ) .",
    "we used a coude spectrograph at the rozhen observatory ( bulgaria ) to obtain spectra of az cas in totality in 2003 , and echelle spectrograph at the asiago observatory ( italy ) to obtain one spectrum near the periastron in 2004 . in figure  2 our spectra",
    "are compared with the spectra of hd  11800 ( k5ib ) and hd  12014 ( k0ib ) taken from the library of @xcite .    in our spectra",
    "the cool component looks like an early k type supergiant . during the totality",
    "there is seen @xmath13 emission with superimposed absorption ( figure  2 : right ) whereas the @xmath14 emission is absent .",
    "@xmath13 emission seems to be especially strong close to the periastron . in figure  3 ( left panel ) the _ u - b _",
    ", + _ b - v _ color  color diagram is presented .",
    "the reddenings for the hot and the cool components are different and _ @xmath15 _ have values @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , which cause an impression that cool component could be somewhat more blue at the eclipse , possibly as a result of an excess of radiation in short wavelengths . during totality , the supergiant looks like k02 type star .",
    "a model resuling from the @xcite code , adopting @xcite orbital parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , can explain quite well the brightening of the system near the periastron as a result of the ellipsoidal effect .",
    "however there is a visible excess of radiation near and during the eclipse ( figure  3right panel ) , which could be produced by a scattering of radiation emitted by the hot component in the very extended envelope of the supergiant .",
    "such effect could also explain the brightening observed in the mid  eclipse phase ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "\\1 . both systems show flux changes in hot component near and after the periastron passage .",
    "+ 2 . the cool component is surrounded by an extended envelope , because : + a. broad atmospheric eclipse in _ u _ bandpass is visible , + b. the color of the cool component is more blue during the eclipse ( scattering of the hot component light in the supergiant envelope ) , + c. the absorption component in @xmath13 appears during the eclipse .",
    "mass loss / transfer leads to changes of the orbital parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath20 , @xmath12 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and not only in the orbital period as it was suggested by @xcite .",
