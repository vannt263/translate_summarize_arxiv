    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect can be used as a powerful probe of cosmology . because the intensity of the sz distortion is virtually independent of redshift",
    ", sz measurements provide an avenue to study clusters and their peculiar velocities to any distance .",
    "additionally , the sz effect allows independent determination of various cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , because the sz effect s amplitude is proportional to the electron density along the line of sight through the cluster , @xmath15 , while the x - ray amplitude is proportional to @xmath16 , sz effect data can yield distances to clusters independently from the cosmological distance ladder .",
    "this information can then be used to provide estimates of the hubble constant @xmath17 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the physics of the sz effect is quite simple ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons can scatter off hot ( @xmath18k ) electrons in a plasma .",
    "a statistical net gain of energy of the photons from the electrons occurs , producing a characteristic distortion in the cmb as seen through the plasma .",
    "this distortion produces a _",
    "decrement _ in the cmb s temperature below about 200 ghz , but an _ increment _ in the cmb s temperature above this frequency .",
    "the most important use of sz increment measurements lies in the determination of the spectral shape of the sz effect in clusters of galaxies .",
    "this shape is the sum of the thermal and kinetic effects together with other sources of emission within the cluster .",
    "the kinetic sz effect is a change in the apparent cmb temperature as seen through the cluster due to the peculiar motion of the cluster relative to the cmb .",
    "the kinetic sz effect may be present in any given cluster and may manifest itself as either a temperature increase or decrease , although it never dominates the thermal effect for expected cluster velocities @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the cluster s properties obtained at several wavelengths can allow separation of these two effects .",
    "if the kinetic effect can be isolated , the cluster s peculiar velocity along the line of sight can be determined .",
    "statistics about large scale flows at a variety of redshifts provide strong constraints on the dynamics of structure formation . in principle , detailed measurement of the sz spectral shape can also constrain the cluster gas temperature through the relativistic correction ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    high frequency measurements can also help separate contaminants such as dusty galaxies which may exist in millimetric measurements , since the dominant sub - mm point sources differ from those seen at longer wavelengths .",
    "measurement of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect increment in galaxy clusters has been an elusive and important goal of observational cosmology for over a decade .",
    "while measurements of the sz effect decrement are common ( @xcite , @xcite ) , measurement and study of the increment has been less successful .",
    "this is largely because current instruments generally lack the sensitivity to measure small amplitude , extended , positive signals in the sky .",
    "also , other positive flux sources in a cluster field can confuse sz measurements ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , experiments working near the null of the thermal sz effect like suzie @xcite , and acbar @xcite are beginning to yield results .",
    "the balloon - borne experiment pronaos has had limited success in sz increment measurements @xcite , and other detections are also claimed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have performed this type of measurement in six galaxy clusters , and find that measurement of any given cluster s peculiar velocity is difficult .",
    "measurement of the sz increment is difficult for a variety of reasons , including the amplitude of the atmospheric signal at sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "@xmath14and @xmath0observations take advantage of windows in the opacity of the sky at these wavelengths , but successful observation of any astronomical source in the sub - mm regime still requires non - trivial atmospheric subtraction techniques .",
    "additionally , because the sz effect is a small amplitude signal extended across a relatively large region of the sky , sensitive instruments which can sample a range of spatial frequencies are required .",
    "care must be taken when reconstructing the spatial shape of the sz effect from data recorded as differences between two or more telescope pointings . as point sources",
    "are expected to be a major contaminant in the sub - mm regime , high resolution is also required to adequately understand their effect in a given field .",
    "one of the instruments currently most capable of performing observations of the sz increment is the sub - millimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ; @xcite ) .",
    "this instrument provides enough sensitivity and angular resolution to detect and remove point sources ( including lensed background sources ) from the data .",
    "scuba also samples large enough regions of the sky to constrain the shape of the sz increment in moderate to high redshift clusters .",
    "however , even with these characteristics , measurement of the sz increment with scuba is not trivial .",
    "the bulk of the data discussed here was obtained on november @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at the summit of mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the jcmt combines a high , dry site with a @xmath22 metre dish and sensitive instruments .",
    "scuba , attached on the nasmyth platform of the jcmt , allows simultaneous observations with @xmath23 @xmath14band bolometers and @xmath24 @xmath0band bolometers .",
    "because the @xmath14band observes very little sz increment flux , while the expected peak of the sz signal occurs near @xmath0 , the @xmath14data can act as a monitor of atmospheric emission in this experiment .    scuba is sparsely sampled spatially , which is undesirable in this experiment . ` jiggling ' to fully sample the array consists of small ( @xmath25 arcsec ) changes in the position of the beam in a regular pattern .",
    "the detectors integrate in each jiggle position for @xmath26s . although @xmath27 positions are required to fully sample both arrays , this experiment used @xmath28 positions because it was only necessary to fully sample the @xmath0array .",
    "moreover , executing the jiggle pattern as quickly as possible is more conservative in terms of residual sky fluctuations .",
    "variations in the signal produced by atmospheric ( sky ) noise and thermal offsets from the instrument are removed by rapid chopping together with slower telescope nodding ( e.g. @xcite ) . rapidly chopping the secondary mirror faster",
    "than the rate at which the sky is varying removes much of this atmospheric signal .",
    "nodding the telescope s primary mirror to a second reference position removes slow sky noise gradients and instrument noise .",
    "these motions produce a chop pattern such that the two reference beams are each observed half as often as the source beam ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the standard scuba mapping mode , the chop occurs at about @xmath29 hz and the nod occurs at about @xmath30 hz .",
    "although a chop throw in the range @xmath31 to @xmath32 arcsec is standard , this experiment requires a chop that does not put significant sz flux in the reference beams ( fig .  1 ) . for this reason ,",
    "an extremely large jcmt secondary mirror chop size of @xmath33 arcsec was used .",
    "@xmath34ks of data were taken , split between several fields .",
    "the cso @xmath35ghz @xmath36-meter was not operational for either observing shift , so we relied on skydips to measure the atmospheric optical depth , @xmath37 , in our data set .",
    "both nights had relatively constant @xmath37 , but the first evening had a lower average ( @xmath38 ) than the second ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "uranus was used as a calibration source throughout .",
    "three clusters and three blank fields were observed during this run ( see table 1 for details ) , referred to as cl@xmath8 , ms@xmath40 , ms@xmath11 , blank @xmath41 , blank @xmath42 and blank @xmath43 hereafter .",
    "@xmath44ks of additional data were collected with an aluminum reflector masking the aperture of scuba .",
    "these data are used as null tests to study scuba s behaviour under both optical and electrical influences ( blank sky data ) and electrical influences only ( reflector data ) .",
    "additional data were taken at the jcmt on october @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 in the same manner as the @xmath21 run .",
    "both cl@xmath8 and another blank field , blank @xmath49 , were mapped .",
    "in addition to the jiggle mapping , photometry of possible point sources in the cl@xmath50 field were performed .",
    "the photometry used a @xmath51 point jiggle pattern with @xmath52 arcsec spacing and a @xmath53 arcsec chop throw .",
    "bolometer g9 of the scuba array was not operating properly during this run and its data are not used here .",
    "a total of @xmath54ks of data were taken in 2002 ; how they are combined with the earlier data is discussed below .",
    "the data are deswitched , flat - fielded and corrected for atmospheric extinction with surf ( the scuba user reduction facility , ) .",
    "extinction correction is performed by calculating the airmass at which each bolometer measurement was made , and then multiplying by the zenith sky extinction at the time of the measurement to give the extinction optical depth along the line of sight . each data point",
    "is then multiplied by the exponential of the optical depth to give the value that would have been measured in the absence of the atmosphere .",
    "the photometric calibration of deep scuba fields like those presented here is known to be accurate to about 15 per cent ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although @xmath55 of this uncertainty is due to error in the absolute calibration of the planets flux .",
    "it is well documented that the deswitched @xmath14and @xmath0time streams are highly correlated , and that this correlation stems primarily from atmospheric noise ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the standard method of removing atmospheric noise from an array is to subtract the array average from each bolometer at each time step .",
    "however , most of the information about the sz flux in this measurement is contained in the difference between the source and reference beam fluxes ( see fig .",
    "@xmath52 ) rather than in the shape of the sz emission across the field of view .",
    "therefore , removing the @xmath56array average at each time step would drastically reduce the inferred sz emission .",
    "however , because the sz effect is small at @xmath57 , using that band s data should mitigate this problem .",
    "a least - squares linear fit of the @xmath14array average to the @xmath0array average at each time step is used to obtain a linear coefficient @xmath58 and an offset @xmath59 ( hereafter referred to as the @xmath60 method ) .",
    "these fit parameters and the @xmath14array averages are then used in place of the @xmath0array average to subtract the atmospheric noise at each time : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the corrected data at time step @xmath63 for bolometer @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the raw , double - differenced and extinction corrected data at time step @xmath63 for bolometer @xmath64 , the angled brackets denote an average over the whole array , and the superscripts denote wavelength .",
    "the fits are performed separately for each ( approximately @xmath66 minute ) observation .",
    "@xmath58 removes the atmospheric emission on scales of about @xmath67s , while @xmath59 removes the atmospheric average over periods long compared to the telescope nod time .",
    "the value of @xmath58 and @xmath59 do not vary by more than 10 per cent over an observation ; this is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 is typically @xmath68 and @xmath59 is of order @xmath69v in our data set .",
    "the linear pearson correlation coefficients of the @xmath14and the @xmath0time streams are on average @xmath70 and never less than @xmath71 for these observations .",
    "the average ratio of the variance of @xmath72 in the time stream of the @xmath73 atmospheric subtraction method to the variance of the @xmath56time stream in the standard surf atmospheric subtraction method is @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath75 method is slightly inferior for removing atmospheric noise .",
    "however , this approach is required for the analysis of sz data , since it allows retention of information on angular scales up to that of the chop throw .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     foreground dust emission could also contaminate the measurement of the sz increment in these clusters .",
    "_ _ iso _ _ data are used to estimate the dust contribution .",
    "the telescope pointings are used to sample the @xmath33and @xmath76__iso _ _ map of the cluster region in exactly the same way as the scuba data .",
    "errors for each measurement are determined from the error map and incorporated into the simulated time stream .",
    "these data are then fit to the model differences .",
    "the @xmath77 values imply that the fits are very poor ; this is expected because any dust emission in the region ( galactic cirrus , extragalactic point sources , or the cluster itself ) is unlikely to be distributed like the isothermal @xmath3 model .",
    "however , the dust may still contribute to the sz signal and so must be removed .",
    "the dust contribution is determined by fitting a modified black body of the form : @xmath78 here , the parameters are the spectral index @xmath79 , dust temperature @xmath80 , and normalization @xmath81 , which is determined using both of the _ iso _ data points weighted by their errors .",
    "@xmath79 is taken to be @xmath82 and @xmath80 to be @xmath83k , parameters which are typical for _ iso_detected cirrus at these wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) . using this model , the dust emission at @xmath14is determined to be @xmath84 mjy  beam@xmath7 for cl@xmath8 .",
    "this value is not very sensitive to variations in the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the fit is corrected for dust emission by the addition of this value , which is a few per cent correction .    because our analysis scheme subtracts the @xmath57flux , a method of retrieving @xmath85 from @xmath86 is required . the actual quantity subtracted from each @xmath0bolometer",
    "s time stream is the average of the @xmath14array at each time step .",
    "this average contains the sz signal sampled as described in fig .  1 , with @xmath87 being the peak isothermal @xmath3 model amplitude .",
    "the average value of the @xmath57array is determined by sampling the model sz profile in the same way as in this experiment .",
    "a map is made based on this data , and the average of this map in the field of view is constructed .",
    "it is found that there is a linear relationship between the input sz amplitude and the average of the differenced map , given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a linear coefficient and @xmath90 is the average of the difference map over the field of view .",

    ", we utilize a likelihood function which searches the @xmath4 - @xmath93 parameter space for its maximum .",
    "previous decrement measurements at @xmath94ghz @xcite , @xmath95ghz @xcite and @xmath96ghz @xcite are used alone to determine a best - fit @xmath4 value , and also in conjunction with our measurement to help constrain both the thermal and kinetic sz effects in cl@xmath8 .",
    "alone , these values yield @xmath97 in this cluster , assuming @xmath98 km s@xmath7 .",
    "our value alone yields @xmath99 under the same assumption .",
    "this measurement is therefore consistent with earlier results .",
    "we find that the @xmath56sz increment value for cl@xmath8 is @xmath100 mjy  beam@xmath7 .",

    "also plotted are the best fit thermal sz effect and dust emission spectra , and the position of the @xmath14band ",
    "centre for reference .",
    "in addition to constraining @xmath4 , the amplitude of the kinetic sz effect is also constrained by this likelihood analysis . using both our measurement and the three decrement measurements",
    ", it is found that the marginalized best fit parameters are @xmath104 and @xmath105 km  s@xmath7 in cl@xmath8 .",
    "assuming @xmath106 , these points yield @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath103 also shows the inferred kinetic sz effect from the @xmath0data .",
    "this result is therefore only a weak constraint on the line of sight peculiar velocity .",
    "a kinetic sz effect in cl@xmath8 may be mimicked by a primary fluctuation in the cmb , because the spectral distributions of the two effects are the same . however , the primary cmb anisotropies at the scales of this experiment , @xmath108 , are about @xmath109k rms ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath110mjy beam@xmath7 signal , which is negligible at our level of precision .",
    "the value of @xmath4 for ms@xmath11 is found by determining the difference @xmath112 for the sz distortions defined by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 for this cluster .",
    "the @xmath4 values giving differences most closely matching the data and 1@xmath115 error points are the best fitting @xmath4 parameter and error bars .",
    "this method yields @xmath116 for this cluster , including relativistic corrections .",
    "these @xmath4 values correspond to an increment of @xmath117mjy  beam@xmath7 , or @xmath118mk .    because little other relevant data exist for this cluster , further analysis is not possible .",
    "the dust contamination can not be estimated because there are no _ iso _ data , and the available dust maps @xcite , which are of poor angular resolution , provide little spectral information .",
    "however , it appears that the dust contamination is at a similar level to that found in cl@xmath8 , and hence is probably negligible .",
    "although one published estimate of the thermal decrement magnitude already exists for ms@xmath11 @xcite , a worthwhile estimate of its kinetic effect can not be made because no explicit @xmath4 parameter or @xmath119 is available .",
    "in principle , measurements of the sz increment , in combination with lower frequency measurements , can yield a great deal of information .",
    "for example , the line of sight peculiar velocity and possibly even the cluster temperature can be determined via measurement of the sz increment . however , measurement of the sz increment with scuba is difficult .",
    "there are three essential components which combined to make this experiment a success .",
    "the first component is a carefully planned observational strategy designed to maximize scuba s sensitivity to an sz signal . using a large chop throw to reduce the tendency to subtract sz signal and chopping in azimuth so that sky rotation reduces the effect of point source contamination are both parts of this .",
    "also , using the @xmath14array average to remove the spurious sky signal , thereby keeping sz information on scales larger than the array size , maximizes the available signal in the data .",
    "controls such as the blank fields , and to a lesser extent the reflector data , are required to check for systematic effects in both the instrument and analysis methods .",
    "the second necessary component of this experiment is the use of custom - designed software to handle the data analysis , which is particularly important for fitting the differenced data directly to a model .",
    "the third important component of this analysis is the removal of point sources in order to reduce their contaminating effect .",
    "because sub - mm bright , high @xmath120 background sources are relatively common in cluster fields , observations of the sz increment could suffer prohibitively from the effects of point sources .",
    "the basic principle we employ is that point sources affect only a few pixels and hence can be distinguished from an extended sz effect .",
    "our data have a confusion limit of approximately @xmath121mjy  beam@xmath7 for sz signals .",
    "integration to scuba s fundamental confusion limit of @xmath122mjy beam@xmath7 rms ( which would require weeks of integration time ) gives an sz confusion of @xmath123mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "our simulations show negligible reduction in the confusion limit of these observations when point sources with amplitude less than about 5 mjy are removed @xcite .",
    "this limit would require approximately 2 shifts of integration time .",
    "unfortunately , decreasing the confusion limit floor below @xmath124 mjy beam@xmath7 would require higher angular resolution observations .",
    "a corollary to this is that sz increment detections from other experiments with lower resolution than scuba , such as suzie and acbar , may be confusion dominated if unsupported by higher resolution data .",
    "these measurements confirm the sz effect in 2 galaxy clusters at an amplitude consistent with the measured decrements .",
    "a weak constraint on the kinetic effect in cl@xmath8 is found which is consistent with the result in @xcite .",
    "we quote a marginal 2@xmath115 sz increment detection in ms@xmath11 , but can not do much more with the data at this point .",
    "it is clear that large reductions in the uncertainty of the value for the kinetic effect velocity in cl@xmath8 will not be achievable because of source confusion with this type of instrument .",
    "this means that scuba is not capable of determining the amplitude of the kinetic effect in any specific cluster , given the expected level of sz  derived peculiar velocities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that the only way to use scuba for constraining peculiar velocities is through a statistical survey of many clusters .",
    "nevertheless , we have demonstrated that , with sufficient care , it is possible to measure the @xmath0increment at the jcmt .",
    "such scuba observations of the sz effect at @xmath0can be combined with measurements at other frequencies to study individual clusters in more detail .",
