    "although the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep)a model in which hard - core particles hop in a preferred direction along a one - dimensional lattice  has been reinvented in various different guises over the years , it is only relatively recently that exact solutions for the steady state(s ) of the model have been available .",
    "the solution of the asep with open boundary conditions in @xcite using a matrix product ansatz was a landmark in the study of driven diffusive systems .    as discussed in a recent review of the matrix product approach to solving for the steady state of nonequilibrium markov",
    "processes @xcite , there are a range of different methods for analysing the thermodynamic phase behaviour of the simplest versions of the asep .",
    "by contrast , more general models  collectively known as the partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep)that admit particles to hop in both directions in the bulk , and even more generally to enter and exit at both left and right boundaries , have so far been studied only through a diagonalisation of the matrices appearing in the formalism @xcite . in this work , we extend a technique that previously admitted an extremely quick derivation of the asep phase behaviour under various updating schemes @xcite to these more general models .    the idea is to consider the behaviour of a `` grand - canonical partition function '' for the model .",
    "more precisely , we examine the generating function of the normalization of the nonequilibrium steady - state distribution over an ensemble of different lattice lengths whose mean is controlled by a fugacity .",
    "the thermodynamic phase behaviour can then be read off from the singularities of this generating function .",
    "whilst obtaining this generating function is straightforward for the asep @xcite , a convenient closed form for the pasep has remained elusive .",
    "our aim here is to demonstrate that a representation of the generating function that allows the thermodynamic phase behaviour to be determined with relative ease takes the form of an infinite continued fraction .",
    "this we arrive at through an interpretation of the pasep normalization as the ( equilibrium ) partition function of lattice paths , which we discuss in section  [ paths ] after recalling the model definition and its basic properties . in section  [ cfracrep ]",
    "we show how to analyse the singularities embedded in the continued fraction representation .",
    "the results we obtain are , of course , equivalent to those obtained within other approaches @xcite . however , given that continued fractions are not frequently encountered in statistical mechanical contexts , we feel there is some value in using the pasep as an illustrative example of how to handle them .",
    "we find that the analysis is intimately related to an approach based on finite - dimensional matrix representations @xcite , exact along special lines in the phase diagram , and that the continued fraction shows how these particular solutions and the general solution are related .",
    "we further show that the continued - fraction approach extends to the most general version of the pasep , solved in @xcite , and that one can access both currents and correlation lengths through it .",
    "finally , we return to the lattice path picture to elucidate the equilibrium counterpart of a nonequilibrium phase transition identified in @xcite that occurs when the bias on bulk hop rates opposes that imposed by the boundary conditions .",
    "the dynamics of the pasep take place on a finite one - dimensional lattice with open boundaries . in its simplest form ,",
    "the microscopic dynamics of the pasep are specified by four rates , one of which can be set to unity by an overall scaling . for a rate @xmath0 associated with a particular event ,",
    "the probability that the event happens in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath1 is @xmath2 . moves that would lead to two particles occupying a single lattice site at any one time are prohibited due to the hard - core repulsion between them .",
    "typical particle configuration and allowed moves in the pasep model . ]    in the pasep particles are inserted onto the left boundary site ( when empty ) at a rate @xmath3 and removed from the right boundary site at a rate @xmath4 , see figure [ fig : paseprules ] .",
    "once on the lattice a particle hops by one site to the right at rate @xmath5 or by one site to the left at a rate @xmath6 when sites are available ( i.e.  empty ) .",
    "it is possible to expand this set of moves to allow particles to enter at the right at a rate @xmath7 and exit at the left at a rate @xmath8 , while still retaining the solvability of the model @xcite .    in all the models we consider we want to calculate @xmath9 , which normalises the statistical weight , @xmath10 , of a lattice configuration , @xmath11 , in the steady state",
    "this is given by @xmath12 so the normalized probability of being in state @xmath11 is @xmath13 .",
    "the weights themselves are obtained through the stationarity condition on the transition rates @xmath14 , @xmath15 = 0 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the probability of making the transition from configuration @xmath11 to @xmath16 in a single timestep .",
    "this is less restrictive than the detailed balance condition for equilibrium states , which is obtained when the sum in equation ( [ steadystate ] ) vanishes term by term .",
    "the solution of the asep in @xcite and the pasep in @xcite made use of a matrix product ansatz @xcite .",
    "in this the steady - state probability @xmath17 of a configuration of particles @xmath18 on a chain of length @xmath19 is represented by an ordered product of matrices @xmath20 where @xmath21 if site @xmath22 is occupied and @xmath23 if it is empty .",
    "we expect @xmath17 to be a function of both the number and position of particles on the lattice , which suggests the choice of non - commuting objects , matrices , for the ansatz . to obtain a scalar probability value from this matrix product it is sandwiched between two vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 : @xmath26 the factor @xmath27 is included to ensure that @xmath17 is properly normalised .",
    "this latter quantity plays the role of a partition function in equilibrium problems @xmath28 where we have defined @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , we shall see in what follows that @xmath27 _ is _ the partition function for an equivalent two - dimensional lattice path problem .",
    "the algebraic properties of the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be deduced from the master equation for the dynamics of the asep , pasep and various other related models @xcite . for the variant of the pasep discussed above , sufficient conditions for equation ( [ eqn : pansatz ] ) to hold are",
    "@xmath32 these relations allow one to calculate @xmath27 and other quantities of physical interest by a range of methods , such as `` normal - ordering '' of the matrices , or through use of explicit representations @xcite .",
    "in this work , we focus on an approach based around the generating function of @xmath27 , namely @xmath33 , which can be thought of as a `` grand - canonical '' normalization .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the large-@xmath19 form of the `` canonical '' normalization ( @xmath27 ) can be determined from the dominant singularity @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "typically , @xmath36 where the exponent @xmath37 depends on the nature of the singularity .",
    "then , by defining a `` reduced free energy '' @xmath38 via @xmath39 we find @xmath40 .",
    "nonanalyticities in @xmath38 can then be associated with phase transitions in the physical system @xcite .    for orientation ,",
    "let us recall the results for the asep , which has @xmath41 .",
    "the canonical normalization can be shown by direct matrix reordering @xcite to be @xmath42 performing the summation @xcite gives the grand canonical normalization @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "this function has a pole at @xmath45 when @xmath46 and similarly at @xmath47 when @xmath48 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath49 and @xmath50 . when neither of these poles contribute , all that remains is the square - root singularity at @xmath51 .",
    "this allows one to very quickly establish the behaviour of the reduced free energy as a function of @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54 & \\mbox{for $ \\alpha , \\ ; \\beta > 1/2 $ } \\\\   \\ln \\left [ \\alpha ( 1   - \\alpha ) \\right ] & \\mbox{for $ \\beta>\\alpha , \\ ; \\alpha<1/2$}\\\\   \\ln \\left [ \\beta ( 1 -   \\beta ) \\right ]   & \\mbox{for $ \\alpha > \\beta , \\ ; \\beta<1/2 $ }   \\end{array } \\right . \\;.\\ ] ] it turns out that for the asep , @xmath34 corresponds to the particle current , and @xmath55 the bulk density in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence , the phase diagram for the model , figure  [ basicpd ] , is quickly recovered using this generating - function ( or grand - canonical ) analysis .",
    "further details of these methods as applied to the asep can be found in @xcite . in the remainder of this work ,",
    "we show how to elicit the structure of the grand - canonical normalization of the pasep , where direct summation of the canonical normalization , given explicitly in @xcite , does not lead to a compact expression like ( [ xaxb ] ) .     the phase diagram of the asep . here",
    "hd , ld and mc denote the high - density , low - density and maximal - current phases , respectively . ]",
    "a useful route to the grand - canonical normalization for the pasep is via the generating function for an ensemble of lattice paths , which in turn can be read off from an explicit representation of the matrices and vectors appearing in the equations ( [ eqn : decommute ] ) , ( [ eqn : eonw ] ) and ( [ eqn : donv ] ) that define the matrix algebra .",
    "a number of representations are known , see @xcite ; the one that is of use here is that for which the vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 have nonzero entries only in their first element : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a constant to be given shortly .",
    "one can verify that , with this choice of boundary vectors , the following tridiagonal representations of @xmath30 and @xmath31 satisfy ( [ eqn : decommute ] ) , ( [ eqn : eonw ] ) and ( [ eqn : donv ] ) : @xmath58 the various parameters that appear are @xmath59 in which we have used the standard notation for ( shifted ) @xmath60-factorials @xmath61    there are various ways to arrive at an interpretation in terms of lattice paths from a matrix representation .",
    "one was suggested by brak and essam @xcite , who used the fact that @xmath62 for the asep to interpret the @xmath30 and @xmath31 as odd - even and even - odd height transfer matrices separately . in",
    "later works @xcite , the path interpretation was inferred from the grand - canonical normalization once this had been obtained by another means . here",
    ", we shall take the most direct approach , which is to associate a height @xmath63 above the origin with the vector @xmath64 ( i.e. , @xmath65 is the number of zero entries that appear before the single nonzero entry ) .",
    "we then interpret @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is some combination of @xmath30 and @xmath31 matrices , as the weight of paths connecting a point at height @xmath65 to another point at height @xmath68 .    of particular importance",
    "is the matrix @xmath69 , which appears in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : zdef ] ) for the normalization . from the above expressions we have that @xmath70 the matrix element @xmath71 then gives the combined weight of paths that begin at height @xmath68 , end at height @xmath65 and contain @xmath19 steps ,",
    "each of which may raise or lower the height by one unit , or leave the height unchanged . since the height is a nonnegative quantity , @xmath72",
    ", these paths may never descend beneath the origin . additionally , since @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the paths that contribute to @xmath27 begin and end at the origin .",
    "paths with these properties are known as _",
    "motzkin paths_.    the weight of various path components can now be obtained by inspecting the form of @xmath75 . for the path to begin and end at the origin ,",
    "every up - step must be accompanied by a down - step ; each up - step down - step pair connecting height @xmath76 to height @xmath65 contributes a weight @xmath77 to the path .",
    "each horizontal step at height @xmath65 contributes a weight @xmath78 to the path .",
    "an alternative interpretion has two types ( or `` colours '' ) of horizontal path segments , one of which contributes a weight @xmath79 and the other @xmath80 .",
    "see figure  [ motzkin - fig ] .",
    "to arrive at the canonical normalization @xmath27 , we sum over all paths of length @xmath19 , and multiply by the factor @xmath81 .",
    "the grand - canonical normalization is constructed by summing paths of all lengths , weighting each segment by @xmath82 , and finally multiplying by @xmath57 . in the next section",
    ", we shall see an equivalent recursive construction which can be expressed as a continued fraction .",
    "two motzkin path transliterations of the tridiagonal matrix representation of the pasep matrices . in both cases ,",
    "up - step down - step pairs contribute a weight @xmath77 , where @xmath65 is the height above the origin of the upper end of the steps . in the left - hand figure",
    ", there is a single type of horizontal step that contributes a weight @xmath83 , where @xmath65 is the height of the segment above the origin .",
    "the right - hand figure shows an equivalent interpretation , in which there are two types of horizontal steps , shown with diamonds and circles at the their midpoints . these contribute weights @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . ]    as a check of the path representation one can compare the expression for @xmath27 which emerges from directly evaluating the matrix product expression for the stationary state , @xmath86 where @xmath87 q^{{\\ensuremath{\\left ( { k+1 \\atop 2 } \\right ) } } } { \\ensuremath{\\left [ { n+k \\atop k } \\right ] } } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ { } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath88 } } \\tilde \\alpha^{n - k } \\tilde \\beta^k \\;,\\ ] ] with the weights which emerge from the contributing paths at low orders . in the above",
    "we have used the standard notation for the @xmath60-binomial coefficient @xmath89 } } = \\frac{(q;q)_n}{(q;q)_{n - k } ( q;q)_k } \\ ; .\\ ] ] for instance , taking the simple case of @xmath90 a direct calculation using the above formulae gives @xmath91 where we have dropped the overall normalization @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath93 denominator disappears when this is written in terms of the original rate parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath94 the expression for @xmath90 in ( [ eqn : z2 ] ) can be seen to be the sum of weights for an up / down step pair from level @xmath95 to @xmath96 , given by @xmath97 and all four possible combinations of two horizontal steps at level zero of either `` colour '' , given by @xmath98 ( where we have again dropped the overall normalization @xmath92 ) . while the diagrammatics becomes increasingly complicated for larger @xmath27 , the principle remains the same .",
    "despite the availability of an exact expression for the canonical normalization , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : zsumrep : q<1 ] ) from @xcite , we have not been able to find a convenient expression for its grand - canonical counterpart due to the @xmath60-dependence of the pasep weights .",
    "a more fruitful route is to represent the lattice - path generating function as a continued fraction , a procedure first expounded by flajolet @xcite .",
    "as we now show , this representation can be read off more - or - less directly from the matrix representation ( [ c ] ) , and the form that emerges is particularly well adapted to discussion of the pasep .",
    "first , for convenience , we subsume the prefactor @xmath99 appearing in ( [ c ] ) into the parameters @xmath100 so that then @xmath101 in the lattice - path language , this means that horizontal steps at height @xmath65 are weighted by @xmath102 and up - down step pairs between heights @xmath65 and @xmath103 are weighted by @xmath104 .",
    "let now @xmath105 be the generating function of weighted motzkin paths that start and end at height @xmath65 , never go below this height , and have their lengths @xmath106 counted by powers of @xmath82 .",
    "that is , the coefficient of @xmath107 in @xmath105 is the weight of such paths of length @xmath19 .",
    "the grand - canonical normalization for the pasep is then given by @xmath108 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath109 is known for some @xmath63 .",
    "then , we can construct @xmath105 by concatenating contiguous components of two types : ( i ) sequences of horizontal segments of arbitrary ( possibly zero ) length at height @xmath65 ; and ( ii ) motzkin paths starting at height @xmath103 enclosed by an up - down pair . denoting these components schematically as @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively ,",
    "we can write the recursion @xmath112 +   \\left [ \\diagup { \\cal m}_{n+1 } \\diagdown   \\underbar{\\hspace{2.5ex } } \\right]^2 + \\cdots \\right ) \\\\ & = & \\frac { \\underbar{\\hspace{2.5ex } } } { 1 - \\diagup { \\cal m}_{n+1 }",
    "\\diagdown   \\underbar{\\hspace{2.5ex } } } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the generating function for a ( possibly empty ) sequence of horizontal segments , each weighted by @xmath113 , is simply @xmath114 .",
    "an up - down pair @xmath115 from height @xmath65 to @xmath103 contributes the weight @xmath116 .",
    "we thus arrive at the generating - function recursion @xmath117 starting at @xmath118 and iterating , we find that the generating function @xmath119 for motzkin paths of arbitrary length ( and hence the grand - canonical pasep normalization ) is given by the infinite continued fraction @xmath120 where we have dropped the factor @xmath57 since this does not contribute to any physical quantities .",
    "such a continued fraction containing both @xmath82 and @xmath121 terms is usually denoted a _ jacobi continued fraction _ , or `` j - fraction '' for short @xcite .    before considering the case of general @xmath60",
    "let us take @xmath41 and see how the expression for the grand canonical normalization , eq .",
    "( [ xaxb ] ) , is recovered .",
    "we have @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 when @xmath41 .",
    "note that in this case , the continued fraction is periodic after the first level .",

    ", we have @xmath129 which coincides with ( [ xaxb ] ) when both are expanded and rationalized .    at @xmath41 the luxury of being able to sum the continued fraction to get equation ( [ fracq0a ] ) makes the phase structure , which ( as previously discussed ) is determined by the singularities of @xmath130 in @xmath82 , immediately apparent . if we are _ not _ able to easily sum explicitly the continued fraction , as is the case for the pasep , we can use more indirect methods to determine the singularities .",
    "we focus here on the `` forward - bias '' regime , @xmath131 , in which the continued fraction has a finite radius of convergence in the complex-@xmath82 plane . in the reverse - bias regime , @xmath132 ,",
    "the continued fraction is unconditionally divergent , a fact we will interpret physically in section  [ pathtrans ] .",
    "we first appeal to worpitzsky s theorem on the convergence of continued fractions @xcite which states that a continued fraction of the form @xmath133 converges if the partial numerators @xmath134 satisfy @xmath135 for @xmath136 given by ( [ fracq0 ] ) this translates to a radius of convergence @xmath34 given by @xmath137 and shows that @xmath138 as @xmath139 .",
    "to decide if this is the dominant singularity , one must also divine the location of any poles in the complex-@xmath82 plane from the continued fraction ( [ fracq ] ) .",
    "the strategy is to examine the @xmath140 _ convergent _ of the continued fraction , that is , the expression obtained by truncating the continued fraction at the @xmath140 level ( counting from zero ) .",
    "denoting this as @xmath141 , we have that @xmath142 and so on .",
    "we observe that the continued fraction ( [ fracq0 ] ) is given _ exactly _ by the convergent @xmath141 if @xmath143 .",
    "inspection of ( [ cn ] ) reveals that this occurs on the special line in the phase diagram given by @xmath144 we observe that on such special lines , the matrix @xmath75 decomposes into two blocks : the first is @xmath145-dimensional , whilst the second does not contribute to the normalisation because only the first elements of the boundary vectors are nonzero .",
    "finite - dimensional representations of the matrix algebra for the pasep were used prior to the advent of the full solution to study the model along these lines , and to conjecture the phase behaviour elsewhere @xcite .    to locate the poles of @xmath141 in the complex-@xmath82 plane , we use the fact @xcite that the reciprocal of each convergent @xmath141 can be expressed as @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 both satisfy the same three - term recurrence @xmath149 but with slightly different initial conditions : @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "hence , @xmath141 has poles that coincide with the zeros of @xmath152 .",
    "these relations for @xmath152 and @xmath153 hold for arbitrary choices of @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "let us now define the function @xmath156 that is given by @xmath152 for the particular choice @xmath157 .",
    "that is , the zeros of @xmath156 give the poles of the pasep grand - canonical generating function along the line in the phase diagram along which the @xmath145-dimensional matrix representation is exact .    as a consequence of the recurrence ( [ anrr ] ) the @xmath152",
    "are closely related to the al - salam - chihara polynomials @xcite and may be written explicitly as @xmath158 where @xmath159 .",
    "if we take @xmath157 to obtain @xmath156 all the terms in the sum in ( [ ansum ] ) will be zero apart from the @xmath160 since they contain a @xmath161 factor in the numerator , which is cancelled only in the last term .",
    "using @xmath162 we thus find @xmath163 where @xmath164 equally , we could have taken @xmath165 and obtained the same result with @xmath166 .",
    "these roots correspond to the reciprocal of the eigenvalues of the finite - dimensional matrices @xmath75 examined in @xcite ( note , however , that the representation used in those works differs from that used here ) .",
    "this fact can be understood by making the ansatz @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the submatrix formed by the first @xmath65 rows and columns of @xmath75 . after substituting into ( [ anrr ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the expression that results from a co - factor expansion along the bottom row in the determinant @xmath169 , as long as @xmath0 is identified with @xmath170 .",
    "we see , then , that the sequence of generating functions @xmath156 has a truly remarkable property : all poles of @xmath156 are poles of @xmath171 where @xmath172 . in principle , a completely different set of singularities could have been obtained after truncating at a deeper level . furthermore , when @xmath131 , @xmath173 if @xmath174 , and hence all convergents have the same dominant pole , @xmath175 . writing this in terms of the original rates @xmath52 and @xmath53 gives @xmath176 or @xmath177 taking now the number of levels ( or , equivalently , the dimensionality of the matrix representation ) to infinity , we find that the dominant singularity will always be the smallest of ( [ zw ] ) , ( [ zaq ] ) or ( [ zbq ] ) .",
    "this observation allows us to recover the reduced free energies for the pasep previously calculated in @xcite , and identify the regions of the phase diagram within which they apply : @xmath178 \\ ; , \\qquad{\\rm for}\\ ; \\alpha , \\ ; \\beta > ( 1 - q)/2\\ ; ,   \\nonumber \\\\ f & = & \\ln \\left [ \\frac { \\alpha ( 1 - q - \\alpha ) } { 1-q } \\right ] \\ ; , \\qquad{\\rm for } \\ ; \\beta>\\alpha , \\ ; \\alpha<(1-q)/2 \\ ; , \\ \\label{eq : frsc<1 } \\nonumber \\\\ f & = & \\ln \\left [ \\frac { \\beta ( 1 - q - \\beta ) } { 1 - q } \\right]\\ ; , \\qquad{\\rm for}\\ ; \\alpha > \\beta , \\ ; \\beta<(1-q)/2 \\;. \\label{eq : frsc>1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as for the asep , this phase structure comprises high- and low - density phase and a maximal current phase .",
    "the key differences lie in the @xmath60-dependent position of the second - order transition line , @xmath179 , and in the subextensive corrections to the free energy , which manifest themselves in the density profile at finite distances from the boundaries @xcite .",
    "as noted above , this analysis of the pasep phase behaviour is similar to that based on finite - dimensional matrix representations @xcite .",
    "the main additional benefit of the present approach is that the relationship between the general expression for the normalisation , given through the non - terminating continued fraction ( [ fracq ] ) , and the versions that apply only on special lines is clearer .",
    "for example , the singularity that arises from non - convergence of the continued fraction , and which governs the maximal - current behaviour , is not detectable by inspection of the finite dimensional matrices .",
    "furthermore , some light is shed on the `` continuity arguments '' expounded in @xcite that lead one to extend physical properties found along special lines to regions of the phase diagram , in that each additional level of the continued fraction yields a singularity that is subdominant to all of those present at the previous level .",
    "we remark that the fact that the asymptotically dominant singularity is present even in the one - dimensional representation is suggestive of an explanation as to why the phase diagram and currents obtained from mean - field theory coincide with the exact results .",
    "as we noted in the introduction it is possible to generalize the pasep boundary conditions to allow `` wrong direction '' injection and removal rates .",
    "in addition to injection at a rate @xmath52 at the left boundary particles may also be removed there at a rate @xmath8 . similarly , in addition to removal at a rate @xmath53 at the right boundary particles",
    "may also be injected there at a rate @xmath7 .    a tridiagonal representation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 with these generalized boundary conditions still exists for the case of non - zero @xmath8 and @xmath7 @xcite and which can be written as @xmath180 @xmath181 where the expressions for @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 ( a notation borrowed from @xcite ) and @xmath57 are given in the appendix .",
    "we can define @xmath186 in an analogous manner to the earlier discussion which leads to a generating function of the form @xmath187 where the coefficients are now @xmath188 even with these more complicated coefficients the singularity structure of the generating function is identical to the @xmath189 case when @xmath131 .",
    "we can still extract poles in order to discern the high- and low - density phases .",
    "explicitly , @xmath190 ( in which the parameters @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 are also given in the appendix ) so that we can pick up the various poles depending on the zeros of the numerator . for non - zero @xmath8 and @xmath7 askey - wilson polynomials @xcite play the role of the al - salam - chihara polynomials",
    "so in this case the denominators of the convergents are given by @xmath195 where @xmath159 as before . if we now choose @xmath196 , for example , to enforce @xmath197 we find that only the final term in the sum contributes again , resulting in the dominant poles @xmath198 or @xmath199 depending on the relative size of @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the maximal current phase is still observed in a similar manner to the @xmath189 case via worpitzky s theorem but a major difference is that the reverse bias phase is absent when @xmath132 , since the particles can now escape at both ends .",
    "algebraically this is manifested in the reflection symmetry relating the parameters for @xmath131 and @xmath132 when @xmath8 and @xmath7 are non - zero : @xmath200 we remark that this continued - fraction representation provides a very quick route to the identification of the dominant singularities in the generating function , and therewith the extensive part of the free energy .",
    "we have so far restricted our discussion to the normalization itself but it is also possible to extract the correlation lengths , which determine the various sub - phases within the pasep phase diagram , in a rather straightforward manner .",
    "we have seen that the leading singularities of the grand - canonical normalization @xmath201 determine the phase structure of the pasep and that these can be extracted from the continued fraction representation either directly as poles when the fraction terminates ( the high- and low - density phases ) , or using worpitzsky s theorem ( the maximal current phase ) .    for a chain of length",

    "if we switch back to the transfer matrix picture of @xmath75 , the leading singularity of the generating function @xmath34 is just the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath75 , @xmath206 , which dominates the normalization as @xmath207 for the two - point function , there is a similar expansion @xcite @xmath208 where the second largest eigenvalue @xmath209 is the inverse of the sub - dominant singularity @xmath210 in the generating function @xmath211 . from this",
    "it is clear that the ratio @xmath212 , or alternatively @xmath213 , determines the correlation length .",
    "if we consider first the high- and low - density phases the sub - dominant singularity is separated from the dominant one and both can be read off directly from the continued fraction representation of @xmath211 . in this case",
    "we descend two levels in the continued fraction in order to extract both the dominant and sub - dominant singularities , which means that we impose @xmath214 , i.e. , @xmath215 or @xmath216 depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "the generating function then truncates to @xmath217 which allows us to extract both the dominant singularity @xmath34 and subdominant singularity @xmath210 for various ranges of the parameters @xmath218 .",
    "as we have already noted in extracting the normalization from the continued fraction , descending to deeper levels still picks up @xmath34 and @xmath210 as the dominant and sub - dominant pole at every deeper level , in addition to the further sub - leading singularities .",
    "this in turn allows us to classify various sub - phases within the high- and low - density phases which have different behaviours of the correlation length .",
    "for example , the low - density phase may be divided into the three sub - phases found in @xcite : + @xmath219 : @xmath220 @xmath221 : @xmath222 @xmath223 : @xmath224 the @xmath210 values which play a role in the @xmath225 and @xmath226 sub - phases are the ( sub - dominant ) poles of the truncated @xmath227 , whereas in the @xmath228 sub - phase it is the singularity determined using worpitzsky s theorem for the full , untruncated @xmath211 .",

    "the correlation length is given by the log of the ratio of the poles @xmath231 .",
    "the phase structure deduced in this manner by considering the singularities of @xmath211 agrees , as it should , with that obtained from considering the integral representation of @xmath27 in @xcite and is shown in figure  [ phasediagram ] .",
    "the various sub - phases @xmath232 of the pasep defined by the behaviour of the correlation length are delineated . ]",
    "in our earlier work on dyck path representations of the asep normalization it was found that the high- and low - density phases of the asep were reflected in bound phases for the lattice paths , whereas the maximal current phase corresponded to an unbound phase .",
    "the second - order transition lines of the asep corresponded to unbinding transition lines for one of the two lattice paths which described the asep normalization and the first - order transition between the high- and low - density phases of the asep corresponded to a cooperative transition involving both paths .",
    "the situation for the @xmath131 phase structure of the pasep is analogous . in the region of the phase diagram corresponding to the high- and low - density phases of the pasep",
    "predominantly one type of horizontal step is bound to the @xmath233-axis , reflecting the majority of particles or holes in the high- and low - density phases of the pasep . in the maximal current phase the entropy dominates and paths are unbound .",
    "for instance , in the low - density @xmath234 phases , indicated in figure  [ phasediagram ] , the horizontal on - axis steps weighted by @xmath235 will make a greater contribution to the partition function than those weighted by @xmath236 and so will dominate the sum .",
    "the reverse is true in the high - density phase where the steps weighted by @xmath236 dominate .",
    "the non - trivial terms in the weights of steps at height @xmath65 are proportional to @xmath237 so these steps do not contribute to the energy as @xmath238 when @xmath131 , but only entropically .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that for @xmath131 the pasep phase diagram is essentially identical to the asep , with only the position of the transition lines changing as @xmath60 is varied .",
    "it is interesting to inquire about the nature of the paths contributing to the partition function for @xmath239 .",

    "@xmath247 which matches the behaviour of ( [ eqn : leading ] ) coming from a `` tent '' path .",
    "heuristically this makes sense since paths which gain in altitude as quickly as possible will donate the highest powers of @xmath60 to @xmath27 and dominate when @xmath132 .    this change in behaviour at @xmath132 to an area - like scaling",
    "is thus interpreted in the lattice path picture as an inflation transition , where the fluctuating path becomes the boundary of an inflated vesicle ( with particular edge weights favouring a speedy ascent ) pinned at its ends to the horizontal axis .",
    "the matrices @xmath202 and @xmath248 initially denoted the presence or absence of particles on a particular site in the original matrix product ansatz .",
    "we can associate an up - step and one colour of horizontal step in a path with , say , the presence of a particle in the original pasep steady state .",
    "looking at the form of the leading contribution to @xmath27 when @xmath132 , namely @xmath244 up - steps followed by @xmath244 down - steps , we can see that this corresponds to a half - filled lattice , which has also been observed in simulations of the reverse bias phase and heuristically derived using particle / hole symmetry arguments @xcite .",
    "the form of equation ( [ eqn : z : q>1 ] ) is reminiscent of the partition function for inflated lattice vesicles with a fixed perimeter discussed in @xcite . if one models a two - dimensional vesicle with a convex polygon of perimeter @xmath249 on a square lattice then the partition function is given by @xmath250 where each component square making up the polygon has a weight @xmath60 and @xmath251 .",

    "in particular it allowed calculations without explicitly summing the generating function in closed form , which was possible ( or at any rate , easy to perform ) only in the @xmath41 case .",
    "consideration of the sub - leading singularities in the continued fraction also allowed the determination of the correlation length in the high- and low - density phases .    a further interesting feature of the continued fraction respresentation of the generating function was that it made clear how the finite - dimensional representations of the pasep algebra , valid only along special lines in the phase diagram , related to the general , infinite - dimensional solution via truncation .",
    "the unusual structure of the poles of the convergents of the continued fraction along these special lines was highlighted , with lower order poles remaining present as the order of the convergent increased and the dominant pole ( for the high- and low - density phases ) already being present at zeroth order .",
    "the presence of the maximal current phase , on the other hand , was deduced from the continued fraction respresentation by using worpitzky s theorem .",
    "the phase transitions of the pasep can be identified with transitions in the lattice path model . when @xmath131 there are similar unbinding transitions to those seen in the dyck path model for the asep , with bound states corresponding to the high- and low - density phases of the pasep and an unbound phase corresponding to the maximal current phase .",
