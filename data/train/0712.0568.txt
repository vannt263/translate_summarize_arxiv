    "at forthcoming high - energy colliders a large amount of events are characterized by complex final states with _",
    "multiple _ hard scales , possibly far apart from each other .",
    "qcd methods to address multi - scale hadronic processes involve the use of parton distributions unintegrated in both longitudinal and transverse components of parton s momentum ( u - pdf s ) .",
    "classic examples are provided by sudakov physics  @xcite and small - x physics  @xcite .",
    "u - pdf s also govern exclusive processes  @xcite and spin  @xcite .",
    "they are required , in general , to explore detailed features of hadronic final states  @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "theoretical and phenomenological studies of u - pdf s are being actively pursued .    in the case of small x ,",
    "u - pdf s can be introduced in a gauge - invariant manner using high - energy factorization  @xcite .",
    "this result was used early on both for monte - carlo simulations  @xcite of x  @xmath0 parton showers and for numerical resummation programs  @xcite for @xmath1  x corrections to qcd evolution equations . for structure function s evolution , methods are being developed ( @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) to match the k@xmath2-dependent , small - x dynamics with perturbative collinear dynamics . for the full simulation of exclusive components of hadronic final states , on the other hand ,",
    "such matching is more complex ( see discussions in  @xcite and  @xcite ) and is not yet available .",
    "this will be critical for turning present event generators based on u - pdf s  @xcite-@xcite into general - purpose monte - carlo tools .",
    "importantly , for x @xmath3 0 u - pdf s may provide a useful framework also for discussing the approach to the saturation regime : see e.g.  @xcite for recent studies .    in the general case , to characterize u - pdf s gauge - invariantly over the whole phase space",
    "is more difficult .",
    "open questions on this issue are the subject of much current activity , see e.g.  @xcite-@xcite , with wide - ranging applications from semi - inclusive processes to parton - shower algorithms to spin physics .    in this report",
    "we concentrate on two topics . in sec .",
    "2 we consider x @xmath4 1 and discuss recent results from k@xmath2 monte - carlos on the jet structure of small - x final states . in sec .  3 we describe ongoing progress towards general operator definitions for u - pdf s , focusing on results for the treatment of x @xmath3 1 endpoint divergences .",
    "there have recently been new calculations of hadronic jet final states from monte - carlo generators based on unintegrated parton distributions .",
    "the idea common to the monte - carlo event generators based on u - pdf s is to use factorization at fixed k@xmath2  @xcite in order to a )  generate the hard scattering event , including dependence on the initial transverse momentum , and b )  couple this to the evolution of the initial state to simulate the gluon cascade .",
    "event generators of this kind include smallx  @xcite , cascade  @xcite , ldcmc  @xcite , and the newer tools  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "different generators employ different models for the evolution of the initial state , such as bfkl  @xcite , ccfm  @xcite , ldc  @xcite evolution . with suitable constraints on the angular ordering of gluon emissions",
    ", these can all be set up to give the correct leading @xmath5 behavior .",
    "a number of subleading contributions is however also of importance for realistic simulations of final states .",
    "the general approach of these monte - carlos and aspects of the differences among them are reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for further references .",
    "although none of the above generators are nearly as developed as standard monte - carlos like pythia  @xcite or herwig  @xcite , they have the potential advantage of a better treatment of high - energy logarithmic effects .",
    "implementing these effects in the shower can be relevant for the simulation of complex final states at lhc energies , see e.g. multi - jet studies in  @xcite , and additional references in  @xcite .",
    "a further potential advantage is that monte - carlos with u - pdf s likely provide a more natural framework  @xcite to simulate the k@xmath2 distribution of the soft underlying event  @xcite ( minijets , soft hadrons ) and , possibly , multiple interactions at very high energies .",
    "on the other hand , present monte - carlos of this kind do not automatically include contributions from collinear radiation associated to x  @xmath6 .",
    "they need to be corrected for this .",
    "this is done partially in present implementations , but not yet in a systematic fashion .",
    "a recent example of a study in this direction is in  @xcite , based on the procedure of  @xcite .",
    "a related issue concerns the inclusion of quark contributions in the initial state . in present implementations these",
    "are either neglected or approximated by lowest - order perturbative evolution  @xcite . the k@xmath2-dependent kernel that governs small - x sea - quark evolution to all orders",
    "is given in  @xcite .",
    "universality properties of this kernel are emphasized in  @xcite .",
    "the quark kernel is not yet implemented in current monte - carlos .    keeping in mind these limitations , monte - carlo event generators with u - pdf s can be used at present within the low - x domain to probe the physical picture of space - like x  @xmath0 parton showers .",
    "a selection of recent results from these event generators is given in the next subsections , going from more inclusive to less inclusive measurements .",
    "available k@xmath2 monte - carlos have been used to analyze data for dis structure functions and for inclusive lepto- and hadro - production of jets , heavy flavors and prompt photons , see  @xcite .",
    "these inclusive analyses serve to test the overall consistency of the physical picture and to perform first determinations of the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "a consistent semi - quantitative picture is achieved with sensible results for the evolved unintegrated gluon distribution  @xcite .",
    "however , the gluon at low scales and low x is only poorly constrained by this approach  @xcite .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the summation of higher orders implied by the monte - carlo should reduce the sensitivity of predictions at high scales to the form of the input  @xcite .",
    "examples of results for jet production in @xmath7 and @xmath8 collisions are reported in figs .",
    "[ fig : jetet ] and  [ fig : jetcdf ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : jetet ] shows the description of the jet @xmath9 distribution data from h1  @xcite obtained with cascade using the recent u - pdf fits  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : jetcdf ] shows the comparison of cdf jet data  @xcite with the monte - carlo  @xcite .",
    "current uncertainties on the unintegrated gluon are large especially in the lowest x region  @xcite .",
    "implications of this are studied for heavy - quark structure functions at hera in  @xcite and for jet production at rhic in  @xcite .",
    "note that first fits of _ both _ the @xmath10- and k@xmath2-dependence of the unintegrated gluon are performed in  @xcite .",
    "a potentially important application of these results is to final states containing higgs bosons at the lhc .",
    "the higgs matrix element coupled to the unintegrated gluon distribution is computed in  @xcite .",
    "first results from monte - carlo implementation are given in  @xcite .",
    "studies of the higgs transverse - momentum spectrum from nlo + soft - gluon resummation  @xcite indicate that small - x terms , although highly subleading from the viewpoint of the soft hierarchy , appear to affect the spectrum at a level comparable to the current theoretical uncertainties estimated as in  @xcite .",
    "further investigations of these effects  @xcite are warranted .",
    "an additional , special application is to central exclusive production , recently considered for higgs  @xcite and scalar @xmath11 mesons  @xcite in the context of u - pdf s .",
    "we conclude this subsection by observing that recently the small - x definition  @xcite of u - pdf s has also been used  @xcite to treat nonleading corrections to jet production at large rapidity separations in hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite , and monte - carlo event generators based on the evolution  @xcite are also becoming available for these processes .      more details of the parton k@xmath2 dynamics can be probed by examining jet correlations in final states containing multiple jets .",
    "recently the zeus collaboration has presented measurements of two - jet and three - jet distributions in dis associated with low x , @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "zeus jet definition is such that nonglobal logarithms from jet clustering are avoided  @xcite , as are double logarithms from symmetric cuts  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : phizeus ]  @xcite shows two - jet data versus the azimuthal separation @xmath13 and versus bjorken x , compared with next - to - leading - order perturbative results  @xcite .",
    "notice the large variation from the order-@xmath14 to the order-@xmath15 result with decreasing @xmath10 and decreasing @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite analyzes the multi - jet final states in the framework of u - pdf s .",
    "in particular , it studies the contribution to potentially large higher - order corrections arising from a sizeable k@xmath2 in the initial state when several well - separated hard jets are produced . in this",
    "kinematics , effects from the x  @xmath4  1 parton shower may be enhanced .",
    "these contributions are important at small @xmath13 , when the jets are not close to back - to - back configurations  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : phipage1 ] shows results for the distribution in the azimuthal separation between the leading jets  @xcite , compared with the measurement  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : thirdjet ]  @xcite shows the angular distribution for the third jet , in the cases of small separations and large separations between the leading jets .",
    "the k@xmath2 monte - carlo cascade gives a good description of the measurement , and gives large differences to the collinear - based parton shower as implemented in herwig , particularly in the region where the azimuthal separations @xmath13 between the leading jets are small .    the x dependence of the gluon distribution used in the above results for the jet cross sections is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ktglu ] for various scales @xmath16 and fixed k@xmath2 .",
    "this analysis indicates that theoretical uncertainties on jet correlations are sizeable at nlo  @xcite and that the k@xmath2 monte - carlo gives an improved description of multi - jets  @xcite compared to standard parton showers .",
    "this analysis is for dis .",
    "however , despite the much lower energy at hera , note that owing to the large phase space available for jet production the hera data may be just as relevant as the tevatron for understanding the extrapolation to the lhc of initial - state radiation effects  @xcite .",
    "transverse energy flow and production of jets and particles at forward rapidities are important probes of the initial - state k@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo results for such observables , however , strongly depend on the details of the model used for evolution of the u - pdf s .",
    "this model - dependence is much more pronounced for forward - region observables than for the jet correlations discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "a systematic understanding of u - pdf s evolution  @xcite will be relevant for more precise interpretations of forward measurements .",
    "see  @xcite for recent work on evolution equations , including discussion of target fragmentation .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite , and references therein , for discussion of current forward - region results .",
    "the possibility to turn the event generators discussed in sec .  2 into general tools to describe hadronic final states over the whole phase space depends on theoretical progress about unintegrated parton distributions .",
    "this will involve precise characterizations of the distributions , factorization and evolution equations . in what follows",
    "we discuss recent progress in the understanding of operator matrix elements for u - pdf s and their lightcone limits .",
    "the relevance of consistent operator definitions for parton k@xmath2 distributions was emphasized long ago , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "ensuring gauge invariance at k@xmath17 , however , is nontrivial . to this end",
    "the approach commonly used is to generalize the coordinate - space matrix elements that serve to identify ordinary pdf s to the case of field operators at non - lightcone distances .",
    "e.g. , for quarks one has  @xcite @xmath18 here @xmath19 are the quark fields evaluated at distance @xmath20 , @xmath21 is in general nonzero , and @xmath22 are eikonal - line operators in direction @xmath23 required to make the matrix element gauge - invariant .",
    "the unintegrated quark distribution is obtained from the double fourier transform in @xmath24 and @xmath21 of @xmath25 . an extra gauge link at infinity",
    "@xcite is to be taken into account in the case of physical gauge .",
    "there are subtleties , however , to using eq .",
    "( [ coomatrel ] ) beyond tree level .",
    "as realized early on  @xcite , parton distributions at fixed k@xmath2 are no longer protected by the kln mechanism  @xcite against uncancelled lightcone divergences near the x @xmath26 1 endpoint  @xcite .",
    "it is only after supplying the above matrix element with a regularization prescription that the distribution is well - defined .",
    "importantly , similar to what observed in  @xcite for the case of the sudakov form factor , the choice of a particular regularization method for the lightcone divergences also affects the distributions integrated over k@xmath2 and the ultraviolet subtractions .",
    "a further set of questions being studied  @xcite are in fact associated with the coefficient functions that govern the expansion of unintegrated distributions in terms of ordinary ones , and the relation of the integral of u - pdf s with ordinary distributions .",
    "the above issues can be analyzed by explicit calculation at one loop  @xcite .",
    "expansion in powers of @xmath27 of the result for the coordinate - space matrix element at this order ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wloop1 ] ) yields @xmath28   \\ \\gamma ( 2 - { d \\over 2 } ) \\   ( { { 4 \\pi \\mu^2 } \\over \\rho^2 } ) ^{2-d/2 } \\right .   \\nonumber\\\\   & & +   e^ { i p \\cdot y v } \\",
    "\\pi^{2-d/2 } \\",
    "\\gamma (   { d \\over 2 } - 2 ) \\   ( - y^2   \\mu^2)^{2 - d/2 } \\nonumber\\\\   & & + \\left .",
    "\\cdots   \\right\\ } \\hspace*{0.2 cm }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the dimensional - regularization scale and @xmath29 is an infrared mass regulator .",
    "the lightcone singularity @xmath30 , corresponding to the exclusive boundary @xmath31 , cancels for ordinary pdf s ( first term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ebmeaexpand ] ) ) but it is present , even at @xmath32 and finite @xmath29 , in subsequent terms .",
    "this implies that , using the matrix element ( [ coomatrel ] ) , the @xmath33 factors from real emission probabilities do not combine with virtual corrections to give @xmath34 distributions , but leave uncancelled divergences at fixed k@xmath2 .",
    "different methods have been employed in the literature to provide u - pdf s with consistent regularization for the endpoint region .",
    "we consider these methods briefly in the next subsection .      a possible approach to treat",
    "the endpoint is to implement a cut - off by taking the eikonal line @xmath23 to be non - lightlike , as in the early works  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the cut - off in x at fixed k@xmath2 is of order @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the incoming momentum .",
    "evolution equations in the cut - off parameter @xmath38 are investigated in  @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis of factorization at leading order has recently been given in  @xcite based on this approach .",
    "a potential drawback of this approach is that cut - off regularization is not very well - suited for applications beyond the leading order . also , as the two lightcone limits @xmath39 and @xmath40 do not commute , the integral over k@xmath2 of the distribution has a finite dependence on the regularization parameter @xmath38 , @xmath41 which makes the relation with the standard operator product expansion not so transparent .",
    "an alternative route is based on the subtractive method  @xcite . in this case",
    "the direction @xmath23 is kept to be lightlike but the divergences are canceled by multiplicative , gauge - invariant counterterms given by vacuum expectation values of eikonal operators .",
    "the counterterms contain in general both lightlike and non - lightlike eikonals .",
    "for this reason studies of u - pdf s in this framework introduce auxiliary eikonals in direction @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 nonzero  @xcite .",
    "the counterterms have compact all - order expressions in coordinate space . at one loop",
    "they provide the regularization of the x @xmath45 1 endpoint through a k@xmath17 extension of the plus - distribution regularization , whose specific form is determined in  @xcite .",
    "the subtractive method is more systematic than the cut - off , and likely more suitable for using unintegrated parton distributions at subleading - log level .",
    "in particular , the specific choice of the counterterms  @xcite is such that the dependence on the non - lightlike eikonal @xmath46 cancels in the matrix element at @xmath47 , corresponding to the ordinary pdf",
    ". the subtractive method may be helpful for global nlo analyses incorporating sudakov resummation  @xcite , and construction of parton - shower algorithms beyond leading order  @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite for studies of subtractive methods similar to those of  @xcite in relation to effective - theory techniques .",
    "further issues arise in higher order .",
    "non - universality of k@xmath2-dependent parton distributions  @xcite has recently been studied  @xcite-@xcite in the hadroproduction of back - to - back high-@xmath48 particles .",
    "potential factorization - breaking effects from soft gluons coupling initial and final states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ]  @xcite .",
    "these would enter at a high order of perturbation theory ( n@xmath49lo correction to dihadron production ) .",
    "although the role of these corrections is yet to be fully established , it is interesting that coulomb / radiative mixing terms also appear to break color coherence  @xcite in high - order contributions to cross sections for dijets with a gap in rapidity",
    ". a satisfactory understanding of factorization should likely require a full clarification of these issues .",
    "monte - carlo event generators are being developed based on gauge - invariant definition of u - pdf s at small x ( sec .",
    "2.1 ) . compared to standard parton shower approaches , these monte - carlos have the advantage of taking into account qcd initial - state radiation processes that depend on the large - k@xmath2 tail of partonic distributions and matrix elements .",
    "such processes are likely to be relevant to the simulation of complex final states characterized by multiple hard scales .",
    "an example is the dis multi - jet correlations discussed in sec .  2.3 .",
    "but we expect analogous considerations to apply for multi - jet final states in hadron - hadron collisions at lhc energies .",
    "this involves a challenging theoretical program , raising new questions on operator matrix elements ( sec .",

    "3.2 ) , and possibly new coulombic effects ( sec .  3.3 ) .",
