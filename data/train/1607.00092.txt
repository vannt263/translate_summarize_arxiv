    "in a superfluid where vorticity is quantized , a turbulent flow is formed with a complex tangle of many vortex lines , which is referred to as quantum turbulence ( qt )  @xcite .",
    "qt has been studied for many decades in superfluid helium , leading to an intriguing comparative study between qt and classical fluid turbulence  @xcite .",
    "atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are actively considered a new system for qt because of recent experimental advances in generating and imaging quantized vortices  @xcite .",
    "qt is also discussed in the context of far - from - equilibrium quantum dynamics , which is one of the frontiers of current quantum gas research  @xcite .",
    "many of the recent works on qt in becs address the decay of two - dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence .",
    "the key question is whether a large - scale vortex structure emerges in decaying 2d qt . this phenomenon is known as the inverse energy cascade and is well established in 2d turbulence in a classical hydrodynamic fluid  @xcite .",
    "based on the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the condensate wave function , many numerical efforts were made to answer the question , but there is still no consensus on the emergence of inverse energy cascades , especially in compressible 2d qt  @xcite . in experiments ,",
    "the 2d regime was addressed by employing becs with oblate geometry , where the vortex line is energetically aligned along the tight confining direction and thus , vortex dynamics is effectively 2d .",
    "neely @xmath4  @xcite reported tantalizing experimental evidence of the inverse energy cascade by observing vortex pinning in an annular bec under small - scale stirring .",
    "however , kwon @xmath4  @xcite observed no signature of large - scale vortex formation in their investigation of the relaxation dynamics of highly oblate , turbulent becs over a wide range of sample conditions .",
    "our interest in this paper is in the effect of thermal damping in the evolution of a turbulent bec , which arises because of the interaction between the condensate and the coexisting thermal atoms at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical works on 2d qt in becs have concentrated on the low - temperature regime by studying the gp equation , if any , with a small phenomenological damping constant . some of those works predicted clustering of same - sign vortices in decaying turbulent condensates  @xcite .",
    "because thermal damping has a tendency to drive a vortex state to a stationary state  @xcite , there must be an upper bound of thermal damping for observing vortex clustering .",
    "it is practically important to figure out whether the temperature requirement is achievable in current experiments .        in a recent experiment  @xcite ,",
    "moon  @xmath4 demonstrated that vortex motion in a bec at finite temperatures is well described by mutual friction between the condensate and the thermal component  @xcite , and measured the dimensionless friction coefficient @xmath1 as a function of temperature . in light of the @xmath1 measurement , in this study , we revisit the experimental results of kwon  @xmath4  @xcite and examine the dependence of the vortex decay rate in turbulent becs on the friction coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the vortex decay rate is almost linearly proportional to @xmath1 , and observe that the finding is supported by numerical simulations using a point - vortex model including longitudinal thermal friction .",
    "furthermore , the vortex decay rates obtained from the simulations are quantitatively consistent with those measured in the experiment , indicating that thermal friction is the dominant dissipation mechanism in decaying turbulence .",
    "one notable observation in the numerical simulations is that vortex clustering can occur in the absence of thermal friction , i.e. , @xmath5 , but it is easily suppressed by small friction that is much weaker than the weakest one observed in ref .",
    "this implies that there is a quite stringent temperature requirement for observing vortex clustering in decaying turbulent becs , providing valuable guidance for experimental efforts in studying 2d qt in becs .    in sec .",
    "ii , we present a comparative analysis of previous experimental results for the vortex decay rate  @xcite and thermal friction coefficient  @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe our simulation study using a dissipative point - vortex model and discuss the effect of thermal friction on vortex clustering in decaying 2d turbulence in becs . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we provide a summary of this work .",
    "in ref .  @xcite , kwon  @xmath4 experimentally investigated the relaxation of superfluid turbulence in highly oblate becs and observed a nonexponential decay behavior of the vortex number @xmath6 , revealing many - vortex effects in the relaxation dynamics .",
    "the decay curve of @xmath6 was found to be phenomenologically well described by the rate equation @xmath7 where the decay constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 were observed to have different temperature dependence . from a simple kinetic consideration ,",
    "kwon  @xmath4 proposed that the linear and nonlinear decay terms in the rate equation are mainly attributed to the drift - out of vortices in the trapped bec and the vortex - antivortex annihilation , respectively .",
    "although the rate equation is useful in quantitatively characterizing the nonexponential vortex decay curve , it is not @xmath10 clear whether the form of the rate equation is valid to represent the relaxation dynamics of turbulent becs .",
    "several numerical efforts were made after the experiment  @xcite , but without reaching an agreement on identifying the universal decay behavior of @xmath6 .    here , we introduce a new measure for quantifying the relaxation speed of a turbulent condensate .",
    "we consider a situation where a condensate has 32 vortices with zero net vorticity , and define a vortex decay rate @xmath3 as the inverse of the time @xmath11 for which the vortex number decreases by one half .",
    "the details of the nonexponential decay behavior of @xmath6 is completely ignored in the determination of @xmath3 , but the value of @xmath3 faithfully reflects the relaxation speed of the turbulent bec . in an experiment , we can prepare a turbulent condensate with @xmath12 and determine @xmath11 from a curve fit of the rate equation in eq .",
    "( 1 ) to the measured @xmath13 .",
    "figure 1 shows the vortex decay rate @xmath3 determined from the experimental data of ref .",
    "the sample condition is specified with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath15 are the atom numbers of the thermal cloud and the condensate , respectively , @xmath16 is the radial ( axial ) trapping frequency of the trapping potential , and @xmath18hz . in a mean - field description ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath19 , condensate radial extent @xmath20 , and temperature @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24-wave scattering length , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the atomic mass . from the expectation",
    "that 2d vortex dynamics would show a scaling behavior with the characteristic energy and length scales of the system , we model the vortex decay rate by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the proportionality coefficient and @xmath30hz ) .",
    "the model fit to the data of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "1 gives the exponents @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34  s@xmath35 .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , moon  @xmath4 generated a doubly charged vortex in the center region of a trapped bec using a topological imprinting method  @xcite and investigated the long - time dynamics of the vortex state .",
    "the doubly charged vortex was split into a pair of corotating vortices and the pair separation monotonically increased over time .",
    "the pair separation evolution was consistent with a point - vortex model including longitudinal friction ( see sec .",
    "iii a ) , and the dimensionless friction coefficient @xmath1 was determined from the increasing rate of the pair separation .",
    "the correlation between the vortex decay rate @xmath3 and the thermal friction coefficient @xmath1 can be examined by estimating @xmath3 under the sample condition in the @xmath1 measurement experiment , where @xmath36 ranges from 0.17 to 1.22 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  hz .",
    "the sample condition is not far from the parameter window surveyed in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , thus allowing to estimate @xmath3 from the power - law formula obtained in the previous subsection . however , the axial trapping frequency is different from that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath18hz , and hence the power - law formula of @xmath3 can not be directly applied to the sample condition of ref .",
    "@xcite . by noting that the characteristic system parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for 2d vortex dynamics are expressed as functions of @xmath39 in eqs .",
    "( 2)@xmath40(4 ) , we propose a generalization of the power - law formula as @xmath41 by introducing the effective condensate atom number @xmath42hz ) .",
    "is estimated under the sample condition in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite and displayed as a function of the friction coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "the solid line is a linear fit to @xmath3 , assuming @xmath43 at @xmath5.,width=226 ]        figure 2 displays the estimated values of @xmath3 under the sample condition in the @xmath1 measurement experiment .",
    "because @xmath1 represents the relative magnitude of thermal damping in vortex dynamics , it is natural to anticipate that @xmath3 increases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , our analysis result is suggestive of a linear relation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is quite intriguing in that the two quantities @xmath3 and @xmath1 are determined separately from different vortex dynamics of trapped becs .",
    "relaxation of turbulent becs would proceed even at @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 for @xmath5 via nonthermal dissipation mechanisms such as phonon radiation , but we believe that their contributions to @xmath3 are negligible in the temperature range of the experiment .",
    "to obtain more insights into the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 , we perform a numerical study of the time evolution of turbulent becs using a dissipative point - vortex model .",
    "this model was successfully employed in the analysis of the long - time dynamics of a corotating vortex pair in ref .",
    "@xcite , providing an essential basis for determining @xmath1 in the experiment .      in the point - vortex model ,",
    "a vortex is regarded as a point object that generates a circular velocity field around itself in a 2d fluid system , and its motion is determined by the velocity fields from all of the other vortices .",
    "we consider a homogeneous condensate with @xmath6 vortices in a cylindrical flat trap of radius @xmath20 .",
    "the velocity of the @xmath46th point vortex is given by  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the position vector of the @xmath49th point vortex from the trap center and @xmath50 is its circulation in units of @xmath51 .",
    "the second term corresponds to the velocity field from the image vortex located at @xmath52 with an opposite circulation of @xmath53 , which is imposed to satisfy the boundary condition that the flow component normal to the cylindrical wall is zero .    at finite temperatures ,",
    "vortex motion is affected by mutual friction arising from the relative motion of the condensate to the thermal component .",
    "assuming a stationary thermal cloud , the longitudinal friction that is proportional to @xmath54 gives rise to an additional vortex motion orthogonal to @xmath55 , and the resultant velocity of the vortex is given by @xmath56 with the dimensionless friction coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "the time evolution of the vortex state is obtained by numerically calculating @xmath57 using eq .",
    "( 6 ) .    in the numerical simulations",
    ", we implement vortex - antivortex pair annihilation by removing two vortices of opposite circulations when they come close to each other within a certain threshold range  @xcite .",
    "the annihilation conditions for a vortex dipole were theoretically investigated  @xcite , and in our simulations we chose a critical pair separation @xmath58  @xcite , where @xmath59 is the condensate healing length , characterizing the density - depleted vortex core size .",
    "we also allow for vortex annihilation at the wall when a vortex collides with its image vortex , which might be regarded as the drifting - out process in the trapped bec .    here , we need to mention the limitations of our model in describing the experimental situation .",
    "first , in the experiments , the condensate was trapped in a harmonic potential and had an inhomogeneous density distribution .",
    "the density gradient induced additional precession motions of the vortices  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the local density ratio of the thermal component to the condensate varied over the sample , resulting in position - dependent thermal friction .",
    "second , the point - vortex model solely focuses on the motional dynamics of vortices in an ideal incompressible fluid , by completely ignoring vortex - phonon interactions  @xcite . in particular , vortex dynamics near the condensate boundary could be sufficiently complicated by involving density waves and surface mode excitations .    .",
    "each data point was obtained by averaging the vortex numbers for 40 different initial states .",
    "the solid lines are nonexponential curve fits to the data using the rate equation in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and the dotted line denotes @xmath60 .",
    "( b ) vortex decay rate @xmath3 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the experimental results in fig .  2 ( open squares ) are displayed together for comparison .",
    "the red solid line is a linear fit to the simulation results.,width=283 ]      following the sample condition in the @xmath1 measurement experiment , we set @xmath61 m and @xmath62 m in our numerical study",
    ". an initial vortex state is prepared by randomly choosing @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where the distance to the nearest neighbor vortex is constrained to be larger than @xmath66 so as to prevent an unexpected , initial rapid decrease in the vortex number . in a regular vortex distribution",
    ", the intervortex distance is about @xmath67 .",
    "figure 3 displays an example for the time evolution of a vortex state , where the vortex number decreases as the evolution proceeds .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the decay curves of @xmath13 obtained for various values of @xmath1 [ fig .",
    "we used 40 different initial states for statistical averaging .",
    "the vortex number shows a nonexponential decay behavior , which is also well described by the rate equation in eq .",
    "the half decay time @xmath11 decreases with increasing @xmath1 , as expected , and the vortex decay rate @xmath68 is found to be linearly proportional to @xmath1 , as observed in the experiments [ fig .",
    "the proportionality constant is measured to be @xmath69  s@xmath35 .",
    "it is remarkable that the vortex decay rates obtained from the numerical simulations show good quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "recalling the limitations of our point - vortex model , this quantitative agreement should be taken with caution .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that our point - vortex model reasonably captures the vortex dynamics of turbulent becs .    to understand the linear relation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 , it is helpful to consider the motion of a single vortex dipole in a homogeneous system under thermal friction .",
    "a vortex dipole with a pair separation @xmath70 propagates linearly with the velocity of @xmath71 .",
    "because of thermal friction , the separation of the two vortices decreases as @xmath72 according to eq .",
    "( 6 ) , and eventually the vortex dipole will be annihilated after the time @xmath73 for @xmath74 . if we regard a turbulent bec as a gas of vortex dipoles with mean pair separation of @xmath75 , then the vortex decay rate may be estimated as @xmath76 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed linear dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , for the case of a condensate with @xmath63 vortices in a cylindrical trap of radius @xmath77 m , we have @xmath78  s@xmath35 with @xmath79 , which is quite compatible with the value of @xmath80 observed in the numerical simulations .     ( a )",
    "@xmath81s , ( b ) @xmath82s , and ( c ) @xmath83s for @xmath5 .",
    "the initial vortex distribution is the same as that in fig .",
    "3(a).,width=321 ]      it is known that in a point - vortex model , vortex states above a critical vortex interaction energy @xmath84 , referred to as negative - temperature states , would evolve into a large vortex structure where like - sign vortices are clustered  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that vortex - antivortex pair annihilation would reinforce the vortex clustering behavior because the energy of the vortex system does not change significantly after pair annihilation but the critical energy @xmath85 is lowered for smaller @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "however , as demonstrated in previous numerical works using the damped gp equation  @xcite , thermal dissipation would weaken the clustering tendency by decreasing the system energy below @xmath85 .",
    "emergence of vortex clustering might be critically determined by a competition between the two effects in the vortex dynamics .    in our simulations , we found that some of our 40 initial vortex states evolved into a state with two like - sign vortex clusters in the absence of thermal friction .",
    "figure 5 displays an example for the time evolution with @xmath5 .",
    "two clusters of same - sign vortices appear after a long evolution time with decreased vortex number [ fig .",
    "remarkably , we observed that the vortex clustering can be completely suppressed even by very small thermal friction .",
    "indeed , figure 3 shows the time evolution of the same initial vortex state for @xmath86 , where the vortex positions are maintained in a random configuration over the evolution .",
    "this observation clearly demonstrates the adverse effect of thermal friction on the emergence of vortex clustering . in the experiment of kwon",
    "@xmath4  @xcite , the value of @xmath1 is estimated to be about 0.01 at the lowest temperatures , indicating that the turbulent becs were in a strong dissipation regime , not allowing for the emergence of a vortex - clustered state out of decaying turbulence .",
    "we investigated the role of thermal friction in the relaxation dynamics of turbulent becs . by examining the correlation between the vortex decay rate @xmath3 and the thermal friction coefficient @xmath1 , which have been separately measured in recent experiments  @xcite",

    "furthermore , we found that the linear @xmath1-dependence of @xmath3 is quantitatively accounted for in the dissipative point - vortex model including thermal friction and vortex - antivortex pair annihilation .",
    "the numerical simulations based on the model showed that the turbulent becs studied in the experiment of kwon  @xmath4  @xcite were in a strong thermal dissipation regime , suggesting that much lower temperatures might be necessary for experimental observation of vortex clustering in decaying turbulence . in current experiments ,",
