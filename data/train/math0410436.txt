    "in deriving uniform asymptotic expansions of a certain class of integrals one encounters the problem of expanding a function , that is analytic in some domain @xmath0 of the complex plane , in several points . the first mention of the use of such expansions in asymptotics is given in @xcite , where airy - type expansions are derived for integrals having two nearby ( or coalescing ) saddle points",

    "other mentions of the use of such expansions in asymptotics is given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , two - point taylor expansions are used with applications to airy - type expansions of parabolic cylinder functions . in @xcite",
    "we used two - point taylor expansions to derive convergent expansions of charlier , laguerre and jacobi polynomials in terms of gamma , hermite and chebyshev polynomials respectively .    to demonstrate an application in asymptotics of multi - taylor expansions we may consider contour integrals of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a vector of parameters , @xmath3 and the phase function @xmath4 has @xmath5 saddle points @xmath6 , @xmath7, ... ,@xmath8 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals for large values of @xmath9 is determined by the saddle - point structure of the phase function [ @xcite , chap .",

    "one method for obtaining an asymptotic expansion of this integral for large values of @xmath9 is based on expanding @xmath10 at the saddle points of the phase function , @xmath11 ( z - z_1)^n(z - z_2)^n\\cdots(z - z_m)^n\\ ] ] and substitute this expansion into ( [ intro ] ) . when interchanging summation and integration , the result is a formal expansion in @xmath5 series in terms of functions related with the functions @xmath12 in @xcite , these functions @xmath13 are the airy functions , whereas in @xcite these functions are the gamma function , or the hermite or chebyshev polynomials .    in a future paper",
    "we will use multi - point taylor expansions in the asymptotic analysis of integrals arising in diffraction theory , such as the bessel function integral ( see @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath14 which is related to the pearcey function @xmath15 the taylor - laurent expansions will be used to study integrals with two saddle points and a pole of the integrand . other applications in asymptotics include the study of hermite - pad approximations to the exponential function ; in @xcite integrals are considered with three saddle points .    in a recent paper @xcite we have introduced the theory of two - point taylor expansions , two - point laurent expansions and two - point taylor - laurent expansions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to generalize that theory from 2 to @xmath5 points , @xmath16 .",

    "the theory of several - point taylor expansions was already formulated in chapter 3 of walsh s book , although in a different setting .",
    "chapter 8 of @xcite presents also a theory of rational approximation of analytic functions , but is different from the theory of multi - point laurent and taylor - laurent expansions presented here .",
    "whereas the multi - point polynomial approximation of chapter 3 may be reformulated as a multi - point taylor approximation , the rational approximation of chapter 8 can not be written as a multi - point laurent or taylor - laurent approximation . for more details ,",

    "for example , applications can be found in initial and boundary value problems in connection with ordinary differential equations and in numerical quadrature of integrals .    from the point of view of interpolation",

    "the theory of several - point taylor expansions is discussed in chapter 3 of @xcite , although in a setting that is different from our approach .",

    "however , our expansions ( 21 ) or ( 32 ) have a different form and a different approximation property : they approach not only at regular points like pad - type approximations but also at singular points of @xmath17 . and of course , the regions and convergence properties in @xcite are different from ours .    apart from applying the present results in problems from interpolation theory , in particular in problems from numerical analysis",

    "orthogonal polynomials and special functions can be studied when the variable and several parameters are large . in that case",
    "more than one or two so - called critical points occur that may give the main contributions to the integral , and expansions of analytic functions at these points gives again the possibility of constructing new convergent expansions with an asymptotic property .",

    "in addition , when the critical points are multiple poles , laurent - type expansions may be considered .",
