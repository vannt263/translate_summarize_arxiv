    "the concept of non - markovianity is a prominent aspect of the dynamics of open quantum systems and has been attracting both theoretical and experimental attention in the last few years  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that non - markovianity can be used as a tool in quantum protocols @xcite , can be employed to take advantage in quantum metrology  @xcite , and can be exploited in quantum key distribution  @xcite .",
    "further concepts behind the non - markovian dynamics have also been investigated , for example , the influence of environment size @xcite and the possibility to pursue new quantum technologies by using non - markovian effects  @xcite .",
    "although all those efforts to understand the connection between non - markovian dynamics and quantum information theory have been performed , measuring non - markovianity is complicated and generally only small systems have been considered  @xcite . however , the real usefulness of a quantum system for computation or simulation is only appreciable in the limit of large - scale information processing .",
    "therefore , it is fundamental to understand the properties of non - markovianity for multipartite systems . recently , various measures for quantifying the degree of non - markovianity of the dynamics of an open quantum system @xcite have been introduced in the literature ; however , there is no consensus on what precisely determines the non - markovianity of a dynamical quantum process",
    ". it has been demonstrated that the conclusions drawn from different measures might not agree depending on the considered physical model .",
    "the most widely used measure of non - markovianity has been introduced by breuer , laine and piilo ( blp ) @xcite . in their seminal paper",
    ", they claimed that information flows only from the system into the environment for a markovian process and the information flow can be measured by the trace distance of two arbitrary quantum states , which probes the distinguishably between them . to implement this measure",
    ", one needs to perform an optimization by checking the dynamics of the trace distance for a huge number of initial sates .",
    "thus , this procedure is very demanding and almost impracticable when dealing with multipartite systems .",
    "moreover , rivas , huelga and plenio ( rhp ) have constructed a measure of non - markovianity that quantifies the deviation from divisibility for a dynamical map @xcite , which is also difficult to be implemented in general . in order to overcome these difficulties , we use an efficient method to evaluate a measure of non - markovianity ,",
    "recently proposed by luo , fu , and song ( lfs ) , based on the non - monotonical behavior of the quantum mutual information for non - markovian processes @xcite .",
    "this measure coincides with other important ones such as the blp measure for quite general cases and can be straightforwardly extended for studying multipartite systems .",
    "when dealing with the interaction between a quantum system and its environment , there are two important physical processes that must be considered : relaxation and decoherence ( here called dephasing ) .",
    "while relaxation is associated to a process involving loss of energy , dephasing is associated to the loss of purity without any exchange of energy between the system and its surroundings . in this work , we explore both processes considering the amplitude damping channel to describe dissipative processes , and taking into account two different kinds of interactions to describe phase damping processes , namely a superohmic dephasing channel and the phase damping case employed to describe impurity atoms coupled to a bose - einstein condensate . for all different scenarios ,",
    "we analyze the effect of both independent and common environmental interactions on the behavior of non - markovianity by investigating two distinct quantifiers of the degree of non - markovianity given by the lfs and the blp measures . for zero temperature environments",
    ", we link the lfs measure to the rate of change of the system entropy @xmath0 and the environment entropy @xmath1 .",
    "we show that , for the lfs measure , a quantum process is non - markovian if the time derivative of @xmath0 is greater than the time derivative of @xmath1 .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the evaluation of the lfs measure for a single qubit , and discuss the behavior of the optimal initial states as a function of the parameters of the environments .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the degree of non - markovianity , for both proposed measures , _ increases _ in general as a function of the number of qubits in the system for the case of independent environments . on the other hand , for global environments",
    ", we show that the amount of non - markovianity depends on the quantum process and the proposed measure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the measures of non - markovianity that will be used in our investigation .",
    "section iii outlines several system - environment models describing the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "section iv and section v include our findings related to the behavior of the lfs and blp measures under the considered models , respectively . section vi covers the summary of the results obtained in this work .",
    "the definition of the lfs measure of non - markovianity @xcite is based on the following : suppose that we have a quantum system in a hilbert space @xmath2 , and a quantum process @xmath3 governing the dynamical evolution of the considered system .",
    "if an arbitrary ancilla system in a hilbert space @xmath4 is introduced , the composite state of the main system and ancilla @xmath5 pertains to the hilbert space @xmath6 . in this case , assuming a trivial dynamics on the ancillary , the time evolution of the total system is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the identity operator acting on the state space of the ancillary .",
    "the amount of total correlations in a bipartite state @xmath5 can be quantified through the quantum mutual information @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the reduced density operators of the system and the ancilla , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "exploiting the fact that quantum mutual information decreases monotonically as a function of time for a markovian process , lfs have proposed a new quantity for measuring the non - markovianity of the dynamical process @xmath3 from an informational perspective : @xmath13 where the @xmath14 is taken over all possible initial states @xmath15 .",
    "even though this measure has an interesting meaning for the quantification of non - markovianity , its evaluation is hard to perform due to the potentially complex optimization problem .    as described in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , a dynamical quantum process is said to be non - markovian if @xmath16 .",
    "note that the ancilla , unlike the system , does not interact with the environment .",
    "in other words , the state of the ancilla is time independent .",
    "therefore , the time derivative of the quantum mutual information can be written as @xmath17 for a zero temperature environment , an interesting result can be obtained from this equation .",
    "since we take @xmath15 as a pure state , and the environment starts in the state @xmath18 for the zero temperature case , the total quantum state composed of the system , the ancilla and the environment is a pure state at any time , leading to @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , following the lfs measure , we obtain a non - markovianity criterion without the need of an ancilla ; therefore , a quantum process is non - markovian if and only if @xmath20 this condition links the non - markovianity measure to the rate of change of the system and the environment entropies .",
    "nonetheless , some peculiar aspects should be noted : the environment is initially in a pure state by assumption , but no restrictions were imposed to the system .",
    "if the system is initially in a pure state as well , we have @xmath21 pure and therefore @xmath22 .",
    "such a result does not mean that the process is actually markovian because we need to maximize over all possible initial conditions of the system to be able to determine the degree of non - markovianity .",
    "an equivalent equation for eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) can be deduced without the necessity of an ancilla : @xmath23 with @xmath24 . the advantage of the above equation over eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) is the fact that the maximization is just over the initial conditions of the system instead of the initial conditions of the composite state of the system and the ancilla , which is required to calculate @xmath25 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the time derivative of the entropy is the important quantity for a non - markovian process .",
    "furthermore , to calculate @xmath1 , we do not need to worry about the state of the environment .",
    "the idea here is to maximize @xmath26 over all possible initial system states and , for each choice , purify it including an extra subsystem .",
    "because the environment is set in a pure state at @xmath27 , the entropy of the system plus the purifier subsystem is equal to the entropy of the environment at any time .",
    "an important observation that deserves to be mentioned is that , to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ nt0 ] ) , it is possible to suppress the calculation of the integrals and time derivatives of the integrands .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to note that we can rewrite the lfs measure as : @xmath28.\\label{nsum}\\ ] ] to compute this quantity , we first determine the time intervals @xmath29 in which the mutual information increases , then we sum up the contribution of each interval to obtain @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",

    "a , we explicitly show that @xmath35 , despite its utility as a witness for non - markovianity , may be misleading and give an inaccurate conclusion about the degree of non - markovianity of a quantum process .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that @xmath25 does not depend on the amount of entanglement shared between the system and ancilla because two distinct initial states with the same degree of entanglement can give different results .",
    "actually , the optimal state is not maximally entangled in general .",
    "the blp measure of non - markovianity @xcite employs the trace distance @xmath36 between two arbitrary reduced density matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 in order to check the distinguishably between them .",
    "such reduced density matrices are resulting from the calculation of the partial trace with respect to the environment part of the total density matrix that describes a system coupled to an environment .",

    "we employ the blp measure to study the degree of non - markovianity for two qubits that are independently interacting with uncorrelated environments . as already discussed in section iv.b , the amount of non - markovianity quantified by the lfs measure increases at least linearly due to the additivity of the von - neumann entropy .",
    "following the same reasoning , our goal is to comprehend the degree of non - markovianity quantified by the blp measure for a system of two qubits . in table 2 , we present the results of our analysis for the superohmic dephasing process , the relaxation process , and for impurity atoms coupled to a bec environment .    by comparing table 1 and table 2 , we observe that the behavior of the degree of non - markovianity , for independent environments , depends on the quantum process . for the case of bec environments ,",

    "if we compare the single qubit case to the two qubits case subjected to independent superohmic dephasing environments , our numerical analysis points out an interesting result : the blp measure remains constant for both cases .",

    "we see that @xmath162 is exactly given by @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the amount of recoherence .    for two qubits subjected to superohmic independent environments , our numerical analysis show that the pair of states that maximize eq .",

    "it means that the recoherence , and consequently the trace distance , are equivalent to the one qubit case , when the pair of states used to calculate the blp are given by @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "although the explanation for the superohmic dephasing process is clear , why the degree of non - markovianity for the bec environment increases ?",
    "the fact that explains such behavior is related to a different pair of initial condition whose amount of recoherence is greater , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "thus , the amount of recoherence given by the element @xmath173 is greater than the amount of recoherence given by the element @xmath168 and consequently the blp measure for the bec model is bigger than the blp measure for the superohmic dephasing model .    ,",

    "in such a configuration , the bec interacts with the two qubits with a higher degree of correlation and thus we practically simulate a common environment . in table 3 , we display the results obtained for all three quantum processes .",

    "taking into account the values displayed in table 1 and table 3 , we see that non - markovianity quantified by the blp measure decreases for the superohmic dephasing process when compared to the single qubit case .",
    "on the other hand , the blp measure increases for both relaxation process and the case of impurity atoms coupled to a bec environment .",
    "particularly , the blp measure is super - additive for these two processes .",
    "in fact , such findings confirm that the amount of non - markovianity is not only related to the exchange of energy between the system and the environment but also fundamentally connected to the spectral density of the reservoir modes and the dynamics of the coherence terms .",
    "we study the degree of non - markovianity of independent and common dephasing and relaxation processes for a single and a pair of qubits . whereas we utilize the amplitude damping channel to represent dissipative processes , we consider the superohmic dephasing channel and the case of impurity atoms interacting with a bec environment to describe phase damping processes .",
    "we develop our investigation by analyzing two conceptually different measures of non - markovianity , a recently introduced quantity called the lfs measure , and the well known blp measure .",
    "considering zero temperature environments , we show that no ancillary system is required to evaluate the degree of non - markovianity quantified by the lfs measure since the quantity @xmath124 can be directly calculated by the difference of the time derivatives of the system and the environment entropies .",
    "such a simplification provides an efficient method for calculating the degree of non - markovianity due to the fact that the hilbert space , where the maximization is evaluated , does not include an additional ancillary system .",
    "we provide an extensive analysis of the lfs measure for a single qubit and determine the optimal initial states of the system required for the evaluation of this particular measure , as a function of the parameters of the environment .",
    "when it comes to the degree of non - markovianity for independent environmental interactions , we demonstrate that the lfs measure might indeed _ increase _ with the number of the qubits in the system for all considered quantum processes .",
    "in particular , we obtain a lower bound to the lfs measure for multipartite systems , namely @xmath174 $ ] which implies that the lfs measure is at least additive . on the other hand ,",
    "we have found the blp measure to be sub - additive for the relaxation process and impurity atoms coupled to a bec environment .",
    "more interestingly , for the superohmic dephasing process , our numerical analysis suggests that the blp measure remains invariant , independent of whether we consider a system consisting of one qubit or two qubits .",
    "furthermore , we examine the behavior of non - markovianity for a system of two qubits interacting with a common reservoir . in this scenario ,",
    "the lfs and blp measures agree on the general behavior of non - markovianity . particularly , the degree of non - markovianity for the relaxation process is found to be super - additive for both of the measures .",
    "however , for a common environmental interaction , depending on the considered quantum process , the amount of non - markovianity can be amplified or diminished as compared to the case of a single qubit .",
    "in fact , although the superohmic dephasing process and the case of impurity atoms coupled to a bec environment do not involve any exchange of energy between the system and its surroundings , both lfs and blp measures indicate that the degree of non - markovianity is fundamentally different for these two processes . that is , while the degree of non - markovianity for two impurity atoms coupled to a bec environment is super - additive , the amount of non - markovianity for the superohmic process decreases very significantly when compared to a single qubit .",
    "indeed , such an outcome points out to the fact that the degree of non - markovianity is significantly dependent on the spectral density of the reservoir modes and dynamics of the coherence terms .",

    "it is clear that @xmath179 underestimates the degree of non - markovianity , and consequently @xmath180 . in fig .",
