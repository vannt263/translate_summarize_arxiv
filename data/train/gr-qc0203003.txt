    "while in classical physics the energy density of a field is strictly positive , quantum field theory allows states containing regions of negative energy density or negative energy fluxes  @xcite .",
    "the casimir vacuum between two conducting plates and squeezed states provide two familiar examples of such states , both of which have been studied experimentally . in these regions of negative energy density",
    "the standard ` local energy conditions ' assumed in classical general relativity no longer hold .",
    "this gives rise to the possibility of avoiding the theorems of classical general relativity such as the singularity theorems and the hawking black hole area increase theorem thus allowing for black hole evaporation to occur .",
    "recent interest in these states has surrounded the apparent violation of cherished beliefs that such states might entail , by appearing to allow the existence of traversable wormholes and ` time machines '  @xcite and violations of cosmic censorship  @xcite and the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "one powerful approach that has evolved to prove that any such violations are limited to microscopic fluctuations and can not produce any macroscopic effect is that of quantum inequalities constraining the magnitude and duration of negative energy regions  @xcite .",
    "an example of such a result in four - dimensional space - time is due to ford and roman  @xcite who showed that for a free massless scalar field in minkowski space - time @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the expectation value of the energy density ( in the frame of an arbitrary inertial observer whose time coordinate is @xmath2 ) in an arbitrary quantum state , and @xmath3 is a ` sampling function ' with characteristic width @xmath4 . for general @xmath5 , fewster and eveson",
    "@xcite proved the stronger and more general bound @xmath6 which was extended to static space - times by fewster and teo  @xcite .",
    "( stronger , indeed optimal , results have been proved in unbounded two - dimensional space - time  @xcite but the physics of particle detection is very different in this case and we choose to discuss it elsewhere . )",
    "central to the issue of negative energy and the second law of thermodynamics is the question of how atoms respond to negative energy fluxes .",
    "the issue is particularly subtle since the quantum inequalities indicate some restriction on the length of time for which a significant negative energy flux can be sustained . as a result",
    "one finds that in discussions of the detection of negative energy fluxes one comes face to face with the infamous @xmath7 uncertainty principle : if one has an unswitched detector then the effects of the negative energy flux are swamped by the positive energy which must surround it . if one tries to measure whether the detector is excited or not while the flux is passing through then that measurement must be made so fast that the switching itself necessarily excites the detector .",
    "these issues were bravely tackled by grove  @xcite , however , his results are clouded by the complications of his analysis , and by the non - standard coupling that he chooses .",
    "the issues were further addressed by ford et al  @xcite who studied the response of an array of quantum - mechanical spin-@xmath8 particles to negative energy fluxes .",
    "the role of the @xmath7 uncertainty principle was again emphasied by helfer  @xcite who formulated an ` operational ' energy condition on the basis of it : `` the energy of an isolated device constructed to measure or trap the energy in a region , plus the energy it measures or traps , can not be negative . ''    in this paper we shall examine the response of ` particle detectors ' to negative energy fluxes . to be able to concentrate our measurements on periods of negative energy flux",
    "we explicitly switch our detector on and off .",
    "this introduces excitations even in the vacuum which we discuss in some detail . to isolate the effects of the negative energy",
    "we then compare the response of a detector switched on and off during a period of negative energy density ( or negative energy flux ) and that switched on and off in the vacuum .",
    "we show that , in line with grove s two - dimensional results , the negative energy can lead to a suppression of excitations that would have occurred for the detector in the vacuum .",
    "however , we additionally show that there exists a quantum inequality limiting the size of this effect .",
    "our analysis also enables us to revisit the question of the response of an inertial detector moving through the rindler vacuum .",
    "this situation was originally studied by candelas and sciama  @xcite .",
    "these authors considered a particular limit where the observation time went to infinity while the final acceleration remained fixed and found that , in this limit , the detector did not respond to the negative energy density of the rindler vacuum but instead responded just as if it were in the minkowski vacuum . while our analysis confirms this result it also shows that there are interesting effects of the rindler negative energy which are simply lost in this limit .    in this paper we have concentrated purely on four - dimensional examples , leaving the many interesting two - dimensional examples to a separate publication .",
    "the principal reason for this is that in two dimensions there are mathematical and physical reasons for preferring a coupling to @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 ( arising from the poor infrared behavior of the massless theory ) ; as a coupling to @xmath10 is more conventional in the four - dimensional literature we prefer to use it here . in addition , as mentioned above , the quantum inequalities which have been proved vary between two and four dimensions with much tighter results available in two - dimensional space - time  @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath11 and use the space - time conventions of @xcite .",
    "we shall deal exclusively with a real scalar field , @xmath10 , and since the effects of negative energy are most pronounced for massless fields we shall restrict ourselves to that case .",
    "our model is a simple generalization of the standard monopole detector in which we include an explicit switching factor .",
    "thus we shall write our interaction lagrangian as @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes proper time along the world - line of the detector , @xmath14 denotes the monopole moment of the detector and @xmath15 is an real switching factor which we have introduced so that we can make measurements over restricted time intervals .",
    "we assume that the evolution of the monopole is determined by a time - independent hamiltonian , @xmath16 , and that the monopole has corresponding energy eigenstates , which we may denote by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "working in the interaction picture the monopole moment then evolves in the standard fashion @xmath19    if the field is initially in the state @xmath20 then by standard first - order perturbation theory we obtain the probability for a transition between the two states of the detector as @xmath21 where @xmath22 the prefactor in eq .",

    "we shall refer to @xmath23 as the response function .",
    "we shall be interested in both excitations @xmath24 and de - excitations @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the fourier transform of the switching function , @xmath26 , with conventions defined by the equation @xmath27 from the reality of @xmath15 it follows that @xmath28 , an equality that we shall use freely in the following .",
    "it is possible to isolate the dependence on the switching from that on the state by writing eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.4 ] ) in the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is independent of the switching function , @xmath15 .",
    "we shall study the response under a range of switchings but we choose them all to be functions of a single dimensionless variable @xmath31 with the two parameters @xmath32 and @xmath4 determining the time of the peak and a measure of the duration of the switching , respectively .",
    "we shall write @xmath33 as a consequence we can write @xmath34 for convenience we will also normalise our switching functions so that their value at @xmath32 is @xmath35 , that is , @xmath36 .",
    "it follows that as we let @xmath37 we recover the standard unswitched detector results , with @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the simplest choice of switching is a sudden switch on and off :    @xmath41    giving @xmath42    as we shall see , the suddenness of this switching leads to additional infinities , so it is also worth considering two smoother functions    @xmath43    giving @xmath44    and    @xmath45    giving @xmath46    these choices are inspired by the theory of data windowing and are based on the welch and hanning windows respectively  @xcite .",
    "we shall consider two further choices of switching which are not of finite duration but which still allow us to concentrate our measurement about one instant of time .",
    "the first is gaussian switching with    @xmath47    giving @xmath48    the second is cauchy ( or lorentzian ) switching , corresponding to the sampling considered by ford  @xcite ,    @xmath49    with @xmath50    we conclude this section by observing that one may attempt to generalize the analysis of davies , liu and ottewill  @xcite , to relate the response of a switched particle detector to the energy density it moves through . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we consider the difference in response between two different states , @xmath20 and @xmath51 , on the space - time to avoid problems of renormalization . for a general motion it is immediate from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.4 ] ) that @xmath52 eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.14 ] ) shows the close relationship between the detector response and the average value of @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , as the left hand side can be negative even when @xmath20 is the vacuum state , so the right hand side must be .",
    "in other words , if @xmath54 denotes normal ordering with respect to the vacuum , then on average the response of the detector in regions where @xmath55 is negative will be less that it would be in the vacuum .",
    "this is a clear four - dimensional analogue of grove s conclusion for two - dimensional motion , appropriate for our more conventional choice of coupling .",
    "the relation to the energy density is rather more tenuous .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to an inertial detector in minkowski space - time then following the methods of ref .  @xcite one can show that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the energy density operator , @xmath58 denotes the coupling to the scalar curvature and the overdot represents differentiation with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear here that the relationship between the energy density and the detector response depends ( not surprisingly ) on the rate at which the switching is turned on and off .",
    "this statement and that relating to @xmath59 above are , of course , strongly dependent on the particular choice of coupling we have made . to conclude we simply note that in the case of gaussian switching one does obtain a somewhat closer relationship : @xmath60",
    "a crucial difference between leaving a detector switched on for all time and introducing some form of switching is that switching itself will induce transitions .",
    "in particular , a switched static detector moving through a static space - time in its natural vacuum state will become excited .",
    "this is the effect we wish to study in this section .    in a static space - time",

    "the ensemble will , of course , cool ( lose entropy ) if it is placed just in the vacuum so we consider the change in entropy relative to the change in the vacuum which is given by @xmath223 .",
    "\\label{eq:6.1}\\ ] ] considering for simplicity states for which @xmath224 ( for example , squeezed states ) we have @xmath225 here the prefactor is manifestly positive so the ensemble which interacted with that state @xmath222 will have cooled more than an identical ensemble in the vacuum if and only if @xmath226 .",
    "the foregoing results serve to clarify the response of matter to pulses of negative energy flux of limited duration .",
    "they are broadly in accordance with one s intuition that negative energy should have the effect of enhancing de - excitation , i.e. to induce ` cooling ' . however , our results are necessarily somewhat model dependent and for our standard monopole model we find that there is not always a simple relationship between the strength of the negative energy flux and the behaviour of matter .",
    "considerable interest attaches to the thermodynamics of negative energy .",
    "if a sustained negative energy flux could be directed at a hot body ( or a black hole ) in such a way as to reduce its temperature , hence entropy , by a macroscopic amount there would appear to be a clear violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "there is a considerable literature on this topic already .",
    "the results of this paper are a first step to investigating the thermodynamics of negative energy . however , the ` cooling ' effects we have discussed can not be immediately used to draw thermodynamic conclusions , because they have been restricted to first order in perturbation theory and , as shown by grove  @xcite , a proper investigation of the thermodynamic implications necessitates a calculation to second order in perturbation theory .",
    "( at first order alone , it is not possible to determine whether the de - excitation effects are merely due to the ( small ) violation of energy conservation expected in any process in which a general quantum state collapses to an energy eigenstate , or whether they pressage a systematic reduction in the energy of the matter which would have serious thermodynamic implications . )",
    "we shall report on this further investigation in a separate paper ."
