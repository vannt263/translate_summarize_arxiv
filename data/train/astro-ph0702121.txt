    "the main concerns about the use of  as a quantitative probe of the dense gas mass come from the particular chemistry and excitation conditions of this molecule .",
    "hcn abundance can be significantly enhanced under the influence of x - ray chemistry driven by an embedded agn @xcite or in the molecular gas closely associated with high - mass star forming regions @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , the excitation of hcn lines might be affected by ir pumping through a 14  vibrational transition near strong mid - infrared sources @xcite .",
    "all these effects will contribute to increase the total hcn(10 )  emission , breaking the claimed proportionality between  and the total dense molecular gas mass . in this context , the conclusions extracted by @xcite about the starburst origin of the ir luminosity in lirgs and ulirgs can be questioned .",
    "in order to test if the hcn(10 )  emission is a fair tracer of the dense molecular gas mass we have conducted with the iram 30-meter telescope a dense molecular gas survey in a sample of 17 lirgs and ulirgs selected to cover homogeneously the - dominated cosmology described by @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite . ] range between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "we discussed that the observed trend could be the result of an anomalous excitation and/or chemistry of the hcn molecule ( or , alternatively , of the hco@xmath0 molecule ; see also * ? ? ?",

    "[ figure 1]a ) we show an updated version of the same plot including our recent hcn(10 )  reobservations of the @xcite sample . with the addition of the new data the existence of a trend is confirmed .",
    "independently of the origin of this trend ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , it is evident that the properties of the dense molecular gas in lirgs are different from those in ulirgs .",
    "it is also clear that it is necessary to observe several dense gas tracers in order to characterise the molecular gas properties in these galaxies .",
    "[ figure 1]b ) also shows that dense molecular gas properties seem to change with increasing  from normal spiral galaxies to lirgs , ulirgs and high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we can see that the sfe of the dense gas traced by the hcn(10 )  line luminosity is significantly higher in lirgs and ulirgs than in normal spiral galaxies .",
    "we can interpret this result in three different ways .",
    "first , it may represent a real variation of the sfe of the molecular gas with ; this is not surprising as the initial mass function ( imf ) and the schmidt law do not need to be the same in different extragalactic environments .",
    "second , if we assume that the sfe of the dense gas is constant independently of , it may indicate that the sfe should be measured using a different tracer of the dense gas mass with a higher critical density than hcn(10 ) .",
    "third , fig .",
    "[ figure 1]b ) may indicate that there is an additional contribution to  from a dust enshrouded agn in the most ir luminous galaxies .",
    "this is probably true in the case of palomar - green qsos and high - redshift galaxies @xcite , but it is not clear in the case of lirgs and ulirgs . we should note that if  overestimates the dense molecular gas content at high ir luminosities , this would imply that the reported increase of the sfe of the dense gas as a function of  would be even higher .    in an effort to constrain the relative abundances and excitation properties of hcn and hco@xmath0",
    "we have studied their j = 32@xmath1110 luminosity ratios in fig .  [ figure 2]a ) .",
    "the critical densities of hcn rotational transitions are higher than those of hco@xmath0 by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "that means that hcn and hco@xmath0 may trace different gas phases with different densities , and that if we want to model the rotational emission of these molecules we need to consider two molecular gas phases with different density and temperature .",
    "however , given the small number of line ratios available , we have taken a more simple approach to interpret our results and we have assumed that both molecules trace the same molecular gas phase ( i.e. similar density and kinetic temperature ) . if we also assume an abundance ratio @xmath13/[hco^{+ } ] \\sim 1 $ ] , and that collisional excitation dominates the rotational emission of these molecules , then a simple lvg analysis indicates that the hco@xmath0 molecule should be more excited ( i.e. a higher j = 32@xmath1110 ratio ) than hcn . in fig .  [ figure 2]a ) we have highlighted in grey the region where hco@xmath0(32)@xmath11hco@xmath0(10 ) @xmath14 hcn(32)@xmath11hcn(10 ) .",
    "about half of the galaxies fall into this region of ` expected excitation ' . however , the other half fall into a region that was not expected by our simple lvg calculations .",
    "this ` unexpected excitation ' can be explained if @xmath13/[hco^{+ } ] \\geq 10 $ ] in these galaxies , an abundance ratio much higher than those observed in galactic star - forming regions ( see for example tab . 10 in * ? ? ?",
    "this result does not depend on the density , kinetic temperature and column density of h@xmath15 considered in the calculations .",
    "we note that in a two phase model the @xmath13/[hco^{+}]$ ] abundance problem would still appear in the densest phase .",
    "we have adopted a similar approach in fig .",

    "if we assume that both molecules trace the same molecular gas phase and have similar abundances , then the hcn(32)@xmath11hco@xmath0(32 ) luminosity ratio should be @xmath16 .",
    "we have highlighted in grey the region where this condition is fulfilled .",

    "their results point to hcn being overabundant with respect to hco@xmath0 and cn by a factor of @xmath20 , while [ hcn]@xmath11[co ] @xmath21@xmath22 and [ hcn]@xmath11[hnc ] @xmath23 .",
    "infrared pumping through higher vibrational transitions may also play a role in the excitation of some of these molecular lines and can equally explain the observed luminosity ratios .",
    "the infrared luminosity of apm 08279 + 5255 is dominated by the contribution of its agn @xcite , which makes this galaxy an ideal candidate to test the effects of the feedback of activity in the properties of the dense molecular gas .",
    "the fact that in this galaxy hcn seems to be overabundant with respect to hco@xmath0 , as we found in some of the galaxies of our sample of lirgs and ulirgs , could indicate that similar processes dominate the dense molecular gas chemistry in these galaxies .",
