    "within qcd , wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite finds its most straightforward application in lepton hadron deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . the cross section for this process",
    "is related to the time - ordered product of two currents , @xmath5 $ ] , which , at short distances , is expanded as @xmath6=\\sum_k c_k(x)\\hs o_k(0).\\ ] ] the coefficient functions @xmath7 embody the short - distance structure of the amplitude , while @xmath8 are local operators whose matrix elements describe long - distance effects .",
    "for dis the ope leads to an expansion of the forward compton amplitude which , by use of dispersion relations @xcite , gives predictions for the moments of the dis inclusive cross section .",
    "unfortunately , for more general hard processes the straightforward use of the ope technique fails .",
    "two ways out of this impasse have been proposed .",
    "the first one @xcite relies on a careful study of collinear and soft singularities order by order in perturbation theory and aims at proving that such singularities can all be lumped into some universal ( i.e. hard - process independent ) functions .",
    "this method has the advantage of being close to the physical parton picture for the hard process . as an alternative , an expansion in terms of _ cut vertices",
    "_ was proposed by mueller @xcite as a more direct extension of the ope . although more formal , the method of cut vertices has the advantage of giving directly an expansion for the absorptive part of the amplitude , i.e. for the cross section , in terms of the convolution of a cut vertex with a coefficient function .",
    "the cut vertex contains all the long - distance effects , and , as such , generalizes the matrix element of a local operator , while the coefficient function , as usual , is calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "the cut vertex method has been used in ref.@xcite to deal with a variety of hard processes in qcd .",
    "let us consider a deep inelastic semi - inclusive reaction in which a hadron in the final state is detected .",
    "when the transverse momentum of the hadron is of order @xmath9 the usual current fragmentation mechanism holds @xcite . in the region",
    "in which the transverse momentum of the produced hadron is much smaller than @xmath9 , the so - called target fragmentation region , the simple description based on parton densities and fragmentation functions fails .",
    "for this reason , in order to describe the target fragmentation region as well , a new formulation of semi - inclusive hard processes in terms of _ fracture functions _ was proposed @xcite and later developed @xcite .",
    "a fracture function @xmath10 gives the probability of extracting a parton @xmath11 with momentum fraction @xmath12 from a hadron @xmath13 while observing a final hadron @xmath14 in the target fragmentation region with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath15 .",
    "the possible relevance of such an object was already mentioned by feynman @xcite before the advent of qcd .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the case in which also the transverse momentum of the hadron @xmath14 ( or equivalently the momentum transfer @xmath16 ) is observed .",
    "we will argue that , in the region @xmath17 , an expansion in terms of cut vertices can be given and that a @xmath0 dependent ( or extended ) fracture function can be defined in terms of a new kind of cut vertex .",
    "we will show , within a @xmath18 toy - model field theory , that extended factorization is just a consequence of collinear power counting @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we recall the definition of cut vertices and we obtain the expansion of the moments of the structure function in terms of matrix elements of local operators times coefficient functions by using cut vertices . in sect .",
    "3 the cut vertex approach is extended to deal with semi - inclusive processes and a generalized cut vertex expansion is given . in sect .",
    "4 we define extended fracture functions and their evolution equation is given and discussed . in sect .",
    "5 we discuss the results and draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we will recall the definition of cut vertices in the simpler case of @xmath18 theory . this toy model , despite its simpler structure , shares several important properties with qcd .",
    "it has a dimensionless , asymptotically free coupling constant and the diagrams with leading mass singularities have the same topology as in ( light cone gauge ) qcd . for these reasons",
    "@xmath18 is an excellent theoretical framework for the study of factorization properties @xcite .",
    "consider the inclusive deep inelastic process @xmath19 off the current @xmath20 .",
    "we define as usual @xmath21 and @xmath12 as @xmath22 let us choose a frame in which @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . given a vector @xmath26",
    "define @xmath27 . the structure function , defined as @xmath28 describes the interaction of the far off - shell current @xmath29 with an elementary quantum of momentum @xmath30 through the discontinuity of the forward scattering amplitude ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ 7 ]    inverting the moments and expressing the extended fracture function in terms of the usual bjorken variable @xmath12 , one finds that @xmath31 obeys the simple homogeneous evolution equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 , defined as @xmath34 is the same dglap kernel which controls the evolution of the ordinary parton distribution functions .",
    "this result looks particularly appealing since it means that the evolution of the extended fracture function follows the usual perturbative behaviour .",
    "one may ask at this point how this result matches with the peculiar equation which drives the evolution of ordinary fracture functions @xcite : @xmath35    the evolution equation for @xmath36 contains two terms : a homogeneous term describing the non - perturbative production of a hadron coming from target fragmentation and an inhomogeneous term whose origin is the perturbative fragmentation due to initial state bremsstrahlung . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the separation between perturbative and non - perturbative fragmentation introduces an arbitrary scale but the fracture function itself @xmath36 does not depend on it .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the evolution equation ( [ inomo ] ) can be derived by an explicit calculation using eq .",
    "( [ eqomo ] ) together with jet calculus rules @xcite . by defining in fact the ordinary fracture function as an integral over @xmath0 up to a cut - off of order @xmath21 , e.g. @xmath37 with @xmath38 : @xmath39 the inhomogeneous term in the evolution equation is obtained by taking into account the @xmath21 dependence of the integration cut - off .    moreover , the interplay between the scales @xmath21 and @xmath0 has a sizeable effect in terms of a new class of perturbative corrections of the form @xmath40 . such corrections are large and potentially dangerous in the region @xmath17 since they can ruin a reliable perturbative expansion .",
    "those terms are naturally resummed into eq .",
    "( [ defi ] ) .",
    "for the extended fracture function these corrections do play an important role for understanding the dynamics of semi - inclusive processes in the kinematic region we have been considering here @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented an extension of the cut vertex formalism to deal with semi - inclusive processes .",
    "we have shown that an extended fracture function can be defined in terms of a new kind of cut vertex .",
    "such an unintegrated , @xmath0-dependent fracture function obeys a dglap evolution equation with the same kernel as the one appearing in ordinary parton densities .",
    "this result is particularly evident in the cut vertex approach and agrees with the analysis made in a different context in ref.@xcite . as a non - trivial check , the more complicated evolution equation for ordinary fracture functions @xcite can be obtained from the simpler one obeyed by extended fracture functions .",
    "although our results have been obtained within the @xmath18 model , where a treatment based on mass singularities and infra - red power counting takes a much simpler form , we believe the extension to qcd to be harmless . indeed , the picture that emerges for semi - inclusive hadronic processes in the target fragmentation region appears to be fully consistent with the intuitive qcd - corrected parton picture .",
    "in addition , a new class of logarithmic contributions appears at @xmath41 .",
    "extended fracture functions could give an additional tool to handle this interesting regime which certainly deserves further study @xcite .",
    "we finally note that the relation between ordinary and extended fracture functions is quite analogous to the one between the experimentally defined / measured diffractive structure functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite which depend upon observing large rapidity gaps .",
    "relating such quantities to fracture functions is another interesting issue for future investigation .",
