    "this results from the fact that s - duality related axion - dilaton solutions all approach the same dilaton - vacuum solution at late times .",
    "by contrast , other symmetries present in the low energy string action , such as the symmetry which mixes the moduli field with the dilaton and axion  @xcite , do not relate solutions with the same late time behaviour and so will not leave the perturbation spectra invariant .    despite the well - known problems associated with achieving a graceful exit from the pre - big bang era , it is worth noting a couple of advantages that the pre - big bang predictions have over conventional ( potential - dominated ) inflation models .",
