    "optically thin , hot accretion flows are widely considered as a relevant accretion mode below @xmath7 in black - hole binaries as well as in agns , and the x - ray radiation - typically dominating the radiative output at low luminosities - is most likely produced by thermal comptonization in the inner parts of such flows ( see reviews in zdziarski & gierliski 2004 , done et al .  2007 , yuan & narayan 2014 , poutanen & veledina 2014 ) . in our previous work ( niedwiecki et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter n14 ) we considered the standard version of hot - flow models , with seed photons for comptonization provided mainly by thermal synchrotron radiation .",
    "we found that such a model roughly agrees with observations of several well studied black hole transients for bolometric luminosities between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for a small sample of well studied agns , observed in the same luminosity range , we found a strong disagreement with the model predictions ; the predicted spectra are much harder than observed and their cut - off energies are too high .",
    "this clearly indicates that in hot flows around supermassive black holes , thermal synchrotron emission is not capable of providing the required flux of seed photons for thermal comptonization , which is the main cooling process at such luminosities . in this paper",
    "we consider extension of the model , taking into account the presence of nonthermal electrons and their nonthermal synchrotron emission .",
    "the presence of such a nonthermal component can significantly increase the efficiency of compton cooling ( see wardziski & zdziarski 2001 , veledina et al .",
    "2011 ) ; while thermal synchrotron is strongly self - absorbed , the non - thermal synchrotron is emitted at higher frequencies and subject to weaker self - absorption , therefore , it is a much more efficient source of seed photons .",
    "see also poutanen & veledina ( 2014 ) for arguments supporting the presence of nonthermal electrons in hot flows .",
    "our model essentially follows the original formulation of advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model ( e.g.  narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "relatively weak coulomb coupling between protons and electrons in a tenuous plasma results in a two - temperature structure , which is a key property of adaf solutions , as such flows are supported by proton pressure . in the innermost part of the flow ,",
    "the hot protons have energies above the threshold for pion production .",
    "therefore , relativistic @xmath0 from charged - pions decay should be always present in adafs .",
    "their nonthermal synchrotron emission was previously studied by mahadevan ( 1999 , hereafter m99 ) for the radio emission of sgr a * , however , it has never been self - consistently implemented as a source of seed photons in models of high - energy emission .",
    "nonthermal particles may be also directly produced by nonthermal acceleration , e.g.  by magnetic reconnection induced by the magneto - rotational instability ( cf .",
    "riquelme et al .  2012 ) .",
    "we take it into account by considering both a nonthermal distribution of protons in hadronic models and the presence of a nonthermal population of electrons not related with the @xmath13-decay rate . in the latter case",
    "the amount of nonthermal electrons is a free parameter ( in contrast to the hadronic model ) ; such models with simple descriptions of accretion flow ( one - zone or approximate radial dependence ) have been considered in the context of adaf solutions e.g.  by malzac & belmont ( 2009 ) , veledina et al .",
    "we apply the model developed in our recent works , see niedwiecki et al .",
    "( 2012 , hereafter n12 ) and n14 , except for the source of seed photons , which includes nonthermal synchrotron radiation , whereas in the previous studies we took into account only thermal synchrotron emission ( and bremsstrahlung , which is negligible for accretion rates considered in our works ) .",
    "we consider a black hole , characterized by its mass , @xmath14 , and angular momentum , @xmath15 , surrounded by a geometrically thick accretion flow with an accretion rate , @xmath16 .",
    "we define the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the gravitational radius and @xmath22 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "we assume that the density distribution is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the height scale at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we define the vertical optical depth as @xmath27 .",
    "we assume the viscosity parameter , @xmath28 , and the ratio of the gas pressure ( electron and ion ) to the magnetic pressure , @xmath29 .",
    "the fraction of the dissipated energy which heats directly electrons is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "we find the global hydrodynamical solution of the general relativistic ( gr ) structure equations following manmoto ( 2000 ) with modifications described in n12 .",
    "most importantly , we use the global compton cooling rate computed using a gr monte carlo ( mc ) method , whereas in similar studies local approximations are usually applied ( see yuan et al .  2009 , xie et al .  2010 ,",
    "n12 and n14 for discussion of related inaccuracies ) .",
    "we find the self - consistent electron temperature distribution , @xmath30 , by iterating between the solutions of the electron energy equation and the gr mc comptonization simulations until we find mutually consistent solutions .",
    "this procedure involves assumption that other parameters of the flow ( density , proton temperature , height scale , velocity field ) are not affected by changes in @xmath5 , which limits the maximum luminosity of the flow to @xmath31 ( at larger luminosities the coulomb cooling of protons becomes important and the flow is characterized by a dramatic dependence on even small changes of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the minimum luminosity of flows which can be studied with our current model , @xmath32 , is given by the requirement that the energy balance for electrons is determined by radiative cooling ( rather than advection ) .",
    "the total luminosity detected far away from the flow is denoted by @xmath33 and the luminosity detected in the 2 - 10 kev range by @xmath34 .",
    "the thermalization as well as cooling time - scales for protons are much longer than the accretion time - scale , @xmath35 , so the distribution of protons is determined by heating / acceleration processes which are poorly understood .",
    "we then consider two limiting cases by assuming that ( i ) all protons have a maxwellian distribution ; ( ii ) a small fraction of protons has a power - law distribution , @xmath36 , and the remaining protons are cold .",
    "these two models are identical to models t and n , respectively , in niedwiecki et al .",
    "( 2013 , hereafter n13 ) ; in particular , the fraction of protons with the power - law distribution is given by equation ( 7 ) in n13 .",
    "we also consider ( only in fig .",
    "[ fig : agn]b ) a hybrid model , with half of the energy stored in the thermal population of protons and another half in the nonthermal ( power - law ) population . for each distribution function of protons , their energy density at each @xmath37 is equal to that obtained from the hydrodynamic solution .",
    "note that in the hydrodynamic solutions we always assume a thermal distribution , however , for a nonthermal distribution the flow structure should not change significantly ( cf .",
    "kimura et al .  2014 ) .    in the computation of the rate of @xmath0 production by charged - pion decay and their nonthermal synchrotron radiation we follow m99 , except for interactions between power - law protons which are taken into account in our model and neglected by m99 ; the simplification applied by m99 underestimates the power in proton - proton interaction products by a factor of @xmath38 ( see n13 ) .",
    "we also used the galprop code ( moskalenko & strong 1998 ) to test our computations of the production and decay of @xmath13 .",
    "for all distributions of protons , the energy spectrum of the produced @xmath0 has a maximum at @xmath39 mev .",
    "for a thermal distribution , it declines exponentially at higher energies . for a power - law proton distribution , it is the power - law at high energies with the same slope as the proton distribution , i.e.  the injection index of electrons , @xmath40 , equals @xmath41 . for the range of parameters considered in this work , at @xmath42 for all relevant electron energies , the synchrotron cooling",
    "time is much shorter than the accretion time , so in all hadronic models the steady state electron distribution is @xmath43 for lorentz factors @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , @xmath46 for the power - law distribution of protons , whereas @xmath47 decreases exponentially for the thermal distribution of protons ( cf .",
    "figure 1 in m99 ) .",
    "we have also checked that the compton cooling time of nonthermal electrons is longer than the synchrotron cooling time , so the steady state distribution is determined by the synchrotron cooling rate .    the time - scale to establish pair equilibrium ( with @xmath0 creation by pion decay balanced by pair annihilation )",
    "is of the order of the accretion time scale ( and much longer than the cooling time scale of nonthermal @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , an approximate pair equilibrium should be established in the flow . in all models",
    "the equilibrium density of pion - decay @xmath0 is at least by 2 orders of magnitude lower than the density of the ionization electrons , so the hadronic @xmath0 contribute negligibly to the optical depth .    in models considering",
    "directly accelerated electrons we assume that a fraction @xmath4 of the total power heating electrons , @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the total power dissipated at @xmath37 ) , is used for direct acceleration of electrons , so at each radius the power used for the acceleration is @xmath50 , while @xmath51 is used for heating of thermal electrons .    in summary , we consider several versions of the hot - flow model .",
    "the purely thermal version , for which the thermal synchrotron radiation is the only source of seed photons , is referred to as the _ standard _ model * s*. the extension of the model , taking into account additional seed photons from nonthermal synchrotron of relativistic @xmath52 produced by @xmath53 -decay , is referred to as the _ hadronic model _ and depending on the assumed distribution function of protons it is denoted by * ht * ( for thermal protons ) , * hn * ( for power - law proton distribution ) or * hh * ( for hybrid distribution with equal energies in a thermal and power - law proton components ) .",

    "similarly as in n14 , we have fitted the hot flow spectra using the slab compps model ( poutanen & svensson 1998 ) .",

    "as we see , various hadronic models with small @xmath1 ( except for model ht with small or moderate @xmath88 ) predict similar @xmath148 relations , which are in agreement with plasma parameters measured in agns .",
    "similarly , model da with @xmath149 agrees with the agn data at @xmath150 .",
    "in n14 we found that lower values of @xmath29 give lower @xmath146 through the change of the flow geometry .",
    "namely , lower-@xmath29 flows are closer to a slab and higher-@xmath29 flows are closer to a sphere and , thus , the compton cooling is less efficient in the latter . in the hadronic models ,",
    "however , the dependence of the @xmath148 relation on @xmath29 is reduced ; the large-@xmath29 flows have much larger proton temperatures and the larger pion - production rate approximately compensates the difference in geometry",
    ".    larger differences between the model predictions , especially those for high and low values of @xmath1 , occur in the @xmath151 relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tetau]b ) . at @xmath152",
    ", @xmath54 gives @xmath153 by a factor of several lower than @xmath154 .",
    "as we see , values of @xmath153 estimated in ngc 4151 and cen a strongly favor low values of @xmath1 . in turn",
    ", @xmath153 estimated from the _ suzaku _ data of ngc 5548 is consistent with large @xmath1 .",
    "however , we emphasize again that the estimation of @xmath153 strongly relies on the precise determination of the spectral cut - off and the discrepancies between different studies of the observed data , noted above , are similar in magnitude to the differences in the model predictions .",
    "the observational uncertainty is illustrated by the difference between plasma parameters for ngc 5548 obtained using the _ suzaku _ and osse data ; almost the same difference for the bright state of ngc 4151 follows from studies of the _ integral _ data by lubiski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and _ bepposax _ data by petrucci et al .",
    "the @xmath135@xmath136 relation , which can be robustly determined in nearby agns , indicates that a source of seed photons much stronger than thermal synchrotron is needed to explain the x - ray radiation of low - luminosity agns by thermal comptonization in hot accretion flows . using a precise hot - flow model",
    "we find that the nonthermal synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons is a good candidate for a sufficiently efficient source .",
    "if the power in the nonthermal electron component equals @xmath155 per cent of the power used to heat the thermal electrons , the model can explain the observed relation essentially for any value of @xmath88 , @xmath29 or @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of the non - thermal component with such a magnitude can be explained by two different mechanisms and it depends on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "if thermal electrons are heated mainly by coulomb interactions ( low @xmath1 ) , the nonthermal electrons may come from the decay of pions produced by proton - proton interactions .",
    "the flux of nonthermal synchrotron photons is then determined by the hydrodynamic solution and the proton distribution function .",
    "remarkably , the hadronic collisions produce a sufficient amount of nonthermal electrons for a broad range of parameters , excluding only a moderately or slowly rotating black hole with a thermal distribution of protons .",
    "the idea that relativistic protons may be responsible for the production of relativistic electrons was considered in several works in 1980s ( e.g.  kazanas & ellison 1986 , zdziarski 1986 , sikora et al .",
    "1987 ) , following realization that the direct fermi acceleration of electrons is much less efficient than the acceleration of protons and , thus , electrons produced by pion decay should outnumber those directly accelerated .",
    "if a large fraction of the accretion power is used for the direct heating of thermal electrons ( large @xmath1 ) , the nonthermal component must be due to direct acceleration of electrons .",
    "such acceleration of electrons is indeed possible in hot flows according to recent mhd simulations ( e.g.  ding et al .",
    "2010 , riquelme et al .",
    "2012 ) . in this version of the model , a specific scaling of the thermal heating and acceleration parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath4 , with the accretion rate",
    "is needed to explain the observed @xmath135@xmath136 anticorrelation .",
    "we note that although @xmath1 and @xmath4 are treated as independent parameters in our computations , they are certainly related to the same microphysical processes that convert the accretion power into the plasma kinetic energy .",
    "we also emphasize that a value of @xmath3 , sufficient to explain the observed data , was assessed under the assumption of monoenergetic injection of electrons . a more realistic scenario , with electrons accelerated into a power - law distribution with the index @xmath40 , is properly approximated by the monoenergetic injection only for @xmath156 . for larger @xmath40 ( which are supported by some observations ,",
    "see below ) , a significant fraction of nonthermal energy is self - absorbed ( for @xmath157 this may be the only form of thermal plasma heating , cf .",
    "malzac & belmont 2009 ) and then a larger value of @xmath4 would be required .",
    "the plasma parameters predicted by the large-@xmath1 and small-@xmath1 models differ significantly and a precise estimation of the electron temperature and optical depth should allow to constrain the value of @xmath1 .",
    "however , results provided by different detectors disagree even for brightest agns",
    ". results of some studies ( based on osse or _",
    "integral _ data ) seem to favor low values of @xmath1 , while other ( using _ bepposax _ or _ suzaku _ data ) appear more consistent with large @xmath1 .    in flows surrounding stellar - mass black holes ,",
    "the nonthermal synchrotron is emitted in the x - ray/@xmath105-ray range .",
    "therefore , the compton cooling is much weaker , and the presence of the nonthermal electron component receiving @xmath155 per cent of the total power ( due to pion - decay for small @xmath1 or direct acceleration for large @xmath1 , similarly is in agn models ) insignificantly affects the electron temperature .",
    "the x - ray spectra predicted by both the hadronic and direct acceleration models for @xmath78 differ only weakly from the spectra predicted by the standard model ( with the thermal synchrotron only ) , which were studied in detail in n14 . in n14",
    "we found that the evolution of black - hole transients agrees with predictions of the standard model , in particular they reach @xmath158 at @xmath159 ( as compared to the intrinsic @xmath160 measured in agns at such @xmath33 ) .",
    "the results of this work indicate that the agreement does not exclude the presence of a significant nonthermal electron component .",
    "we conclude that the hot flow model with seed photons produced by the nonthermal synchrotron radiation provides an attractive description for all accreting black - hole systems , with the difference between agns and black - hole transients around @xmath7 explained by the scaling of basic physical processes with the black - hole mass .    finally , we comment on the observability of spectral features formed by pion - decay @xmath0 .",
    "the annihilation feature is not observable , e.g.  for the model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec](c ) the observed luminosity of the annihilation photons is @xmath161 erg / s . the high - energy part of the synchrotron radiation perhaps could be observed in bright nearby objects , like cyg x-1 .",
    "however , the mev tail which is observed in cyg x-1 at @xmath102 ( e.g.  del santo et al .",
    "2013 ) is over an order of magnitude stronger than the synchrotron component predicted by the model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec](c ) for the solution with @xmath162 .",
    "if the observed tail is produced in the hot flow , it indicates that an efficient direct acceleration must take place in the flow , because the @xmath13-decay electrons can not produce a tail with such a magnitude at such @xmath33 .",
    "however , the tail may be produced in other sites , e.g.  in a cold disc corona , as suggested e.g.  by the increase of the relative strength of the nonthermal component with the increasing intensity of the thermal disc emission , assessed by del santo et al .",
    "we note also that the high - energy tail in gx 339 - 4 was revealed in the rising phase of gx 339 - 4 by droulans et al .",
    "( 2010 ) at @xmath163 much larger than these of our solutions and the results of this work can not be used to estimate the corresponding strength of pion - decay component",
    ". a relevant hot flow model , with strong coulomb cooling of protons , would be characterized by a much larger density and hence , for a nonthermal proton distribution , by an enhanced pion production .",
    "interestingly , spectral modeling of the above observations of nonthermal tails with hybrid models indicate that a steep injection index of electrons , @xmath164 , is required .",
    "such a steep injection can be explained by the decay of pions for a steep acceleration index of protons , such as assumed in our computations .",
