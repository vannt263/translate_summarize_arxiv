    "the mass of the @xmath0 boson , @xmath3 , is one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model . as is well known  @xcite , a precise measurement of @xmath3 , along with other precision electroweak measurements , will lead , within the standard model , to a strong indirect constraint on the mass of the higgs boson . once the higgs itself is found",
    ", this will provide a consistency test of the standard model and , perhaps , evidence for physics beyond .",
    "the precise measurement of @xmath3 is therefore a priority of future colliders .",
    "lep2 and run ii at fermilab ( @xmath4  fb@xmath5 ) are aiming for an uncertainty on @xmath3 of about 40 mev  @xcite and 35 mev  @xcite , respectively .",
    "an upgrade of the tevatron  @xcite , beyond run ii , might be possible , with a goal of an overall integrated luminosity of @xmath6 and a precision on @xmath3 of about 15 mev . clearly , hadron colliders have had and will continue to have a significant impact on the measurement of @xmath3 . in this short paper",
    "@xcite we investigate the potential to measure @xmath3 at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    ". the lhc will provide an extremely copious source of @xmath0 bosons , thus allowing in principle for a statistically very precise measurement .",
    "in section 2 we consider the detector capabilities , in section 3 the theoretical uncertainties , and in section 4 the experimental uncertainties .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "a potential problem is that the general - purpose lhc detectors might not be able to trigger on leptons with sufficiently low transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) to record the @xmath0 sample needed for a measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "while this may be true at the full lhc luminosity ( @xmath8 ) it does not appear to be the case at @xmath2 .",
    "based on a full geant simulation of the calorimeter , the cms isolated electron / photon trigger  @xcite should provide an acceptable rate ( @xmath9  khz at level 1 ) for a threshold setting of @xmath10  gev / c .",
    "this trigger will be fully efficient for electrons with @xmath11  gev / c .",
    "the cms muon trigger  @xcite should also operate acceptably with a threshold of @xmath12  gev / c at @xmath2 .",
    "atlas should have similar capabilities .",
    "it is likely that the accelerator will operate for at least a year at this ` low ' luminosity to allow for studies which require heavy quark tagging ( e.g. , @xmath13-physics ) .",
    "this should provide an integrated luminosity of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "the mean number of interactions per crossing , @xmath15 , is about 2 at the low luminosity .",
    "this is actually lower than the number of interactions per crossing during the most recent run ( ib ) at the fermilab tevatron . in this relatively quiet environment",
    "it should be straightforward to reconstruct electron and muon tracks with good efficiency .",
    "furthermore , both the atlas@xcite and cms@xcite detectors offer advances over their counterparts at the tevatron for lepton identification and measurement : they have precision electromagnetic calorimetry ( liquid argon and pbwo@xmath16 crystals , respectively ) and precision muon measurement ( air core toroids and high field solenoid , respectively ) .",
    "the missing transverse energy will also be well measured thanks to the small number of interactions per crossing and the large pseudorapidity coverage ( @xmath17 ) of the hadronic calorimeters .",
    "the so - far standard transverse - mass technique for determining @xmath3 should thus continue to be applicable .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the problem that the increase in @xmath15 will create for run ii ( and beyond ) at the tevatron . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that it will substantially degrade the measurement of the missing transverse energy and therefore the measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "large theoretical uncertainties arising from substantial qcd corrections to @xmath0 production at the lhc energy could deteriorate the possible measurement of @xmath18 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc]a ,    we present the leading order ( lo ) calculation and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd calculation  @xcite of the transverse mass distribution ( @xmath19 ) at the lhc ( 14  tev , @xmath20 collider ) in the region of interest for the extraction of the mass .",
    "we used the mrsa  @xcite set of parton distribution functions , and imposed a charged lepton ( electron or muon ) rapidity cut of 1.2 , as well as a charged lepton @xmath7 and missing transverse energy cut of 20 gev .",
    "we used @xmath3 for the factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "no smearing effects due to the detector were included in our calculation .",
    "the uncertainty due to the qcd corrections can be gauged by considering the ratio of the nlo calculation over the lo calculation .",
    "this ratio is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc]b as a function of @xmath19 . as can be seen ,",
    "the corrections are not large and vary between 10% and 20% . for the extraction of @xmath3 from the data ,",
    "the important consideration is the change in the shape of the @xmath19-distribution . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc]b , the corrections to the shape of the @xmath19-distribution are at the 10% level . note that an increase in the charged lepton @xmath7 cut has the effect of increasing the size of the shape change ( it basically increases the slope of the nlo over lo ratio ) , such that for the theoretical uncertainty is is better to keep that cut as low as possible . for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig : tev ] we present the same distributions as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] for the tevatron energy ( 1.8  tev , @xmath21 collider ) .",
    "the same cuts as for the lhc were applied . as can be seen",
    "the corrections are of the order of 20% and change the shape very little .    currently , the estimated uncertainty on @xmath3 associated with modelling the transverse momentum distribution of the w ( _ i.e. _ due to qcd corrections ) is of the order of 10  mev at the tevatron@xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the larger qcd corrections at the lhc suggest that the uncertainty will also be larger . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 distribution of the w can be constrained by data ( both @xmath0 and @xmath22 ) and the significant increase in statistics available , first at the upgraded tevatron and then at the lhc , should keep the uncertainty under control . note also that even though the shape change due to qcd corrections is undoubtedly larger at the lhc than at the tevatron , in absolute terms it is still small and a next - to - next - to leading order calculation might be able to reduce the theoretical uncertainty to an acceptable level .",
    "although such a calculation does not yet exist for the @xmath19-distribution , one may certainly imagine that it will be before any data become available at the lhc .",
    "an alternative would be to use an observable with yet smaller qcd corrections .",
    "recently  @xcite , it was pointed out that the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath22 observables ( properly scaled by the respective masses ) are subject to smaller qcd corrections than the observables themselves .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] for the transverse mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio]a the ratio of nlo / lo calculations for the distribution of events as a function of the mass - scaled transverse mass @xmath23 is presented ; @xmath24 for the @xmath0 and @xmath25 for the @xmath22 .",
    "the cuts for the @xmath0 case are as described before .",
    "the @xmath22 is required to have one lepton with @xmath26 and the @xmath7 cuts are scaled proportionally to the mass compared to the @xmath7 cut in the @xmath0 case   to @xmath22 observables close to the cut . ] .",
    "[ fig : ratio]b shows the factor nlo / lo for the quantity defined as the ratio of the number of @xmath0 events to the number of @xmath22 events at a given @xmath23 .",
    "as can be seen the nlo corrections to this quantity are much less dependent on @xmath23 than the distribution themselves .",
    "indeed , the corrections are similar for the @xmath0 and @xmath22 mass - scaled distributions and therefore cancel in the ratio .",
    "this ratio could then be used to measure the @xmath0 mass , with small theoretical uncertainty .",
    "note that the measured mass and width of the z are already used to calibrate the detectors  @xcite in current analysis  @xcite .",
    "compared to the standard transverse - mass method , the ratio method will have a larger statistical uncertainty because it depends on the @xmath22 statistics , but a smaller systematic uncertainty because of the use of the ratio .",
    "this concept has now been verified in an experimental analysis@xcite .",
    "overall this ratio method might therefore be competitive if the systematic uncertainty dominates the overall uncertainty on @xmath3 in the transverse - mass method .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to study the sytematic uncertainties in detail ; in what follows we shall benchmark these uncertainties using the demonstated cdf and d0 performance .",
    "the ratio method can also be used with other distributions , like the @xmath7-distribution of the charged lepton itself , see  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the average bjorken-@xmath27 of the partons producing the @xmath0 at lhc with the cuts considered in this paper is @xmath28 , compared to @xmath29 at the tevatron . without the rapidity cut , the range of @xmath27 probed at the lhc is much larger , going from below @xmath30 to above @xmath31 .",
    "the uncertainty due to the parton distributions will thus be different at the lhc and tevatron .",
    "considering that this uncertainty might dominate in this very high precision measurement , complementary measurements at the tevatron and lhc would be very valuable .",
    "it is not possible to quantify this statement considering the present status of pdf uncertainties  @xcite .    at this time , it is obviously impossible to predict the overall theoretical uncertainty at the lhc .",
    "the present uncertainty of @xmath32  mev from the @xmath0 production model@xcite would already limit the precision of the mass measurement attainable in run  ii at the tevatron , so there is obviously great motivation to reduce such uncertainties .",
    "part of our goal in writing this paper is to emphasize that such motivation also exists for the lhc , by demonstrating its potential for an extremely precise @xmath0 mass measurement . in the rest of this paper",
    "we shall assume that the theoretical uncertainty at the lhc will be decreased to a value lower than the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the single @xmath0 production cross section at the lhc , for charged lepton @xmath33  gev/@xmath34 and pseudorapidity @xmath35 , and transverse mass @xmath36 , is about @xmath37 times larger than at the tevatron with the same cuts   transverse momentum to be less than 15 or 30  gev does not significantly change this result . ] . scaling from the latest high - statistics @xmath0 mass measurement at d0  @xcite , where @xmath38 @xmath39 events were taken from an integrated luminosity of 82  pb@xmath5",
    ", we then expect at the lhc @xmath40 reconstructed @xmath41 events in one year at low luminosity ( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta ] shows that if the lepton rapidity coverage at the lhc were increased above the @xmath42 assumed here , a large gain in signal statistics would be obtained , since the rapidity distribution is rather broad at the lhc energy .",
    "the configuration for which one bjorken-@xmath27 is very large and the other one very small is favored and creates the maxima at @xmath43",
    ".    3 in    the gain would be of order two if leptons were accepted out to @xmath44 , which is covered by the electromagnetic calorimetry of the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments , and as high as a factor of four for @xmath45 which may be covered by other experiments  @xcite .",
    "as already noted , it is not straightforward to estimate the precision with which @xmath3 can be determined because of the importance of systematic effects ; even a full geant simulation of a detector is unlikely to include all of them .",
    "we have therefore based our estimate on a parametrization of the actual cdf and d0 @xmath3 uncertainties developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to extrapolate to higher luminosity .",
    "the parametrization includes the effect of the number of interactions per crossing , @xmath15 ( which degrades the missing @xmath46 resolution ) , and of those systematic effects which can be controlled using other data samples ( such as @xmath22 bosons , @xmath47 mesons , etc . ) and which will therefore scale like @xmath48 .",
    "this behavior appears valid for the most important systematic uncertainties in the present measurement , such as the energy scale determination , underlying event effects , and the @xmath7 distribution of the @xmath0 .",
    "the use of these parametrizations , of course , explicitly does not take into account any of the detector improvements offered by the lhc detectors over their tevatron counterparts which were described earlier .",
    "the parametrized statistical and systematic uncertainties on @xmath3 are given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the total number of events .",
    "taken at face value these would suggest that @xmath51  mev could be reached .",
    "however , these parametrizations do not account for effects which do not scale as @xmath48 .",
    "such systematic effects , which are not yet important in present data , will probably limit the attainable precision at the lhc .",
    "there is however an opportunity to measure the @xmath0 mass to a precision of better than @xmath52  mev at the lhc .",
    "it is worth noting that , while we have assumed that only one year of operation at low luminosity is required to collect the dataset , considerably longer would undoubtedly be required after the data are collected in order to understand the detector at the level needed to make such a precise measurement .",
    "in conclusion , we see no serious problem with making a precise measurement of @xmath3 at the lhc if the accelerator is operated at low luminosity ( @xmath2 ) for at least a year .",
    "the cross section is large , triggering is possible , lepton identification and measurement straightforward , and the missing transverse energy should be well determined .",
    "the qcd corrections to the transverse mass distribution although larger than at the tevatron , still appear reasonable .",
    "a precision better than @xmath52  mev could be reached , making this measurement the world s best determination of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "we feel that it is well worth investigating this opportunity in more detail .",
