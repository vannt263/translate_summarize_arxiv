    "virtualization provides an easy solution to the objective of cloud , by facilitating creation of virtual machines ( vms ) on top of the underlying hardware , or , physical machines ( pms ) , resulting into improved resource utilization and abstraction .",
    "infrastructure as a service ( iaas ) clouds provides raw vms on which the user can install their own software or applications .",
    "the issues that a cloud service provider must take care of are elasticity , scalability , migration , and performance isolation , out of which , performance isolation is a very critical challenge .",
    "the resource allocation algorithms take resource requirement of a vm into consideration and changes the allocated resources , thus making it an on demand elastic cloud . virtual machine placement and migration",
    "are an integral part of resource allocation in cloud .",
    "changing resource requirements of vms can be a critical information for vm placement and migration decisions . in a cloud ,",
    "placement algorithms are responsible for efficient placement of vms on physical hosts .",
    "initial placement of a vm and subsequent resource usage based placement form a resource allocation procedure in cloud .    in this paper , a novel vm placement algorithm is presented which takes into account the application specific resource usage made by the vm .",
    "the resources are classified into three categories , cpu , network , and disk i / o .",
    "any application would consume these three basic resources .",
    "the collective usage of these resources by the applications will result in the total resource usage by the vm . on the basis of usage of these resources , we classify or differentiate various vms and apply new vm placement algorithm .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows , section [ secrirc ] discusses the problem of performance isolation and its relation with the formulation of vm placement , section [ sece1 ] introduces an initial experiment , section [ secpa ] introduces the novel algorithm , section [ sece2 ] discusses the experiment to explore the success to the proposed algorithm , and section [ secioa ] discusses the current implementation of the proposed algorithm , section [ secrw ] discusses the related work and section [ seccfw ] describes conclusion and future work .",
    "an efficient resource allocation method will optimally place vms on pms such that the overall resource utilization is maximized @xcite .",
    "it also incorporate ways of introducing efficient and green data centres @xcite , and increase _",
    "return on investment ( roi)_. as stated in section [ secint ] , performance isolation is very critical issue , and has been studied extensively @xcite , yet an ideal situation of performance isolation can not be achieved . with some initial experiments to understand the co - existential or neighbour dependent behaviour of vms , the authors inferred that the problem of performance isolation can be improved by reducing the resource contention amongst the vms on same physical host .",
    "+ performance isolation can be drawn to the lowest level abstraction of shared resources like cpu , memory , network and disk , for example , disk is continuously being used by multiple processes waiting in i / o queue .",
    "thus , i / o scheduler will play a vital role in resource contention , as studied in @xcite . to review the resource contention properties of various applications",
    "( in turn , vms ) , experiment 1 has been conducted and described in next section .",
    "the objective of experiment 1 is to observe the co - existential behaviour of different vms , and how their performance is affected when placed with certain kind of vms .",
    "the vms used in this experiment exploit the individual resources like cpu , network , and disk i / o .       `",

    "the configuration for the physical machines is provided in table [ tmachineconf ] .",
    "the configuration for the virtual machines is provided in table [ tvm1 ] .",
    "the experiment was conducted by executing the following benchmarks -    * _ cpu intensive : _ `",
    "sysbench ` @xcite was run in cpu test mode for 120 seconds to calculate the prime numbers from 1 to 80,000 .",
    "the result generated was the number of events of prime calculation that occurred in 120 seconds . * _ disk intensive : _ `",
    "sysbench ` was run in fileio mode for 120 seconds to perform random read and write operations on 128 files of 2 gb , the result generated here too was the number of events that occurred in 120 seconds .",
    "* _ network intensive : _ the ` apache http ` server was installed on the vm , serving a static html web page , and was benchmarked as follows , using ` ab ` @xcite , to serve 100,000 requests , with 10 concurrent request in each iteration .",
    "the result generated here was the average time taken per request , in milliseconds .",
    "the machines cpu1 and cpu2 are cloned instances of cpu intensive test vms specified in section [ subsectestvm ] , similarly for disk1 and disk2 , and for web1 and web2",
    ".    .vm classification [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     after running the experiment as mentioned above , the vm disk3 was not assigned to any physical host ( refer figure [ 3fnuplac ] ) , as it requires 2 vcpus and assigning it to any physical server would breach the pcpu limit .",
    "in such a case vupic declares such a vm to be invalid / unfit for placement .",
    "this behaviour is enforced so that the other vms may not be affected by the high need of vcpus by disk3 , however , it can be placed with a high degree of compromise , or can be migrated to another cloud , and this decision can be made by the user and can be configured in vupic .",
    "in current version , vupic is a collection of interdependent python scripts , which handles the task of logging the resource usage done by the vms , producing ruvs using the mean resource usage from the generated log , and generating placement schedule .",
    "the vupic clients generate the resource usage logs and using them generate the ruvs as mentioned in equation [ eqruv ] , and the ranges for the components used are as specified in table [ tabrange ] .",
    "the resource generation script has a cpu overhead of around 3% , and can be attributed to its collection of information from three different sources of xentop @xcite , ifstat @xcite , and iotop @xcite .",
    "these ranges can be changed with ease , and as mentioned before , the statistical function used to generate the ruv can be replaced by any other function .        the current version of the vupic client generates the ruvs and stores them on the storage server for each client as a file .",
    "the vupic server uses these files to generate the placement schedule",
    ". this schedule can be used by any migration manager to execute the migration .",
    "the problem of resource allocation is similar to that in grids and clusters .",
    "some of the popular resource allocation mangers used in various environment are gram @xcite , and condor @xcite .",
    "some popular cloud management system are open nebula @xcite , eucalyptus @xcite and nimbus @xcite .",
    "opennebula provides for _ match making scheduler _ where it does _ rank scheduling _ as specified by the user .",
    "resource allocation issue also arises when a vms upscale their available resource to meet the increased demand .",
    "virtual machine placement is a critical and central issue related to resource allocation in cloud and it has been studied extensively . c. hyser et .",
    "@xcite provides with a framework for autonomic placement manager .",
    "there are a number of virtual machine placement algorithms which aim to provide energy efficient scheduling , a. verma et .",

    "intensive applications with low latency has been studied in @xcite . as the performance isolation",
    "can be mapped to low level of physical machine , the cpu scheduler also plays a role in deciding performance of virtual machines as studied in @xcite .",
    "there are a number of resource allocation strategies which have been created from the point of view of maximizing physical resource utilization as studied in @xcite , the problem reduces to that of the classical np - hard problem of bin packing .",
    "another approach is to reduce the network traffic due to intra - vm communications as studied in @xcite .",
    "network aware placement has been studied by j. t. piao et .",
    "al . in @xcite .",
    "these algorithms work with optimal migration algorithm , which may take into account the post - migration network load @xcite and minimizing the vm down time @xcite .",
    "the proposed novel vm placement algorithm significantly improves the vm performance , which otherwise was compromised .",
    "the paper also introduces the concept of resource usage variation and provides efficient method to incorporate the same using resource usage vectors ( ruv ) in placement decision .",
    "the algorithm generates a placement schedule , which can be easily deployed using any of the above mentioned migration techniques .",
    "[ conclusion ] the present work incorporates performance isolation and resource contention properties into account while taking vm placement as well as resource allocation decisions .",
    "any infrastructure cloud would be a multi - tenant service provider and would host virtual machines of varied types on different physical servers .",
    "virtual machines generate different resource usage and thus create a behavioral usage pattern .",
    "experiments were conducted to show how individual vms affect and get affected by the neighboring vms on the same physical server . currently , there is no virtual machine placement algorithm that takes the resource usage patterns into account .",
    "the proposed novel algorithm takes resource usage by the virtual machines into account while making placement decisions , and also provides an efficient way to incorporate these resource usage patterns into the algorithms using a 3-dimensional vector called resource usage vector ( ruv ) .",
    "a modified version of the same algorithm has been presented which takes care of vms with multiple vcpus and also restricts the cpu over commitment .",
    "both of these algorithms generate a migration schedule which minimizes the number of unnecessary migrations by allocating a vm to its original host if all the constraints are satisfied .",
    "the generated migration schedule can be executed using an optimal migration algorithm to reduce the migration costs .",
