    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) commonly have outflows and jets , and these structures / phenomena may strongly influence the surroundings of the agn . while direct jet - gas interactions affect the velocity field of the local medium , they also produce fast , auto - ionizing shocks which can significantly influence ( or even dominate ) the observed emission - line strengths and kinematics . in nearby agn ,",
    "the warm ( t@xmath2 k ) , ionized gas in the narrow - line region ( nlr ) can be resolved on scales of a few tens of parsecs in the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) .",
    "they are therefore useful laboratories for determining the extent and kinematics of the various species in the gas , and the role of shocks in producing the integrated emission - line spectrum @xcite .",
    "because extinction by dust is lower by a factor of @xmath110 relative to the optical , nir spectroscopy allows us to probe depths unreachable at shorter wavelengths .",
    "seyfert 2 galaxies are the preferred targets as the line of sight to the nucleus is blocked by the intervening dust and molecular material , allowing the study of the environment of the agn without the effect of dilution caused by the bright central source .    in this context , ngc4388 , a highly inclined ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath3 ; ) seyfert2 galaxy in the virgo cluster @xcite , is a prime target for studying possible feedback effects of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) on the distribution and kinematics of ionized gas and stars . to start with , it was one of the first galaxies in which a conically - shaped nlr was detected @xcite .",
    "wfpc2/hst observations reported by @xcite in the [ oiii ] filter confirmed the v - shaped nlr with opening angle of 90@xmath4 toward the south , extended over 560  pc in this direction . in the perpendicular direction , [ oiii ]",
    "was detected over 720  pc .",
    "most of the [ oiii ] emission comes from regions south of the nucleus , except for some emission corresponding to the counter - cone , which is obscured by the host galaxy , at the ne side of the nucleus .",
    "galactic - scale outflows as well as a rich complex of highly ionized gas that extends @xmath14kpc above the disk were detected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected soft x - ray emission extending over 4.5kpc in observations with rosat .",
    "later , @xcite and @xcite using chandra , found that the soft x - ray emission is coincident in extent and overall morphology with [ oiii ]  @xmath55007   . in the radio , @xcite and @xcite found that ngc4388 is double - peaked with a primary peak on the nucleus and a secondary peak 230  pc southwest of it .",
    "they also report a plume of radio plasma to the north of the optical nucleus .",
    "the good overall match between optical emission - line and radio morphology reported by @xcite led them to suggest that ngc4388 is an example of an interaction between a radio jet and ambient gas .",
    "an additional property that makes ngc4388 interesting is the presence of water maser emission from a circumnuclear disk , allowing accurate measurement of the mass of its smbh .",
    "@xcite , using vlbi , studied the kinematics of the water maser emission and derived a bh mass of 8.5@xmath6  m@xmath7 .",
    "moreover , @xcite found a stellar nuclear disk with pa of 75@xmath4 , radius of @xmath1200  pc , and a 100  pc - scale jet oriented at a pa of 24@xmath4 .    in the nir ,",
    "ngc4388 has not been studied very extensively , with most spectroscopic studies reported in the @xmath8 and @xmath9bands only @xcite .",
    "they all indicate that ngc4388 is a complicated system with much spatial structure at all wavelengths .",
    "very recently , @xcite found , by means of @xmath8band ifu data , a drop in the stellar velocity dispersion in the inner @xmath1100  pc , interpreted as the signature of a dynamically cold central component .",
    "they also report [ sivi ]  1.963@xmath0 m and br@xmath10 oriented at pa@xmath11 , aligned with the jet on similar scales , and also with the [ oiii ] emission that traces the narrow line region .    because of the mounting evidence of jet - gas interactions and rich circumnuclear structures / environment in ngc4388 , we are interested in studying the inner 500  pc of this source to more closely examine the physical conditions of the atomic , molecular and ionized gas .",
    "our aim is to carry out , for the first time , a simultaneous analysis of the spectral region 0.84@xmath12 m .",
    "it includes the wavelength intervals where the brightest nir lines in agns are located ( i.e. , [ siii ]  0.953  @xmath0 m , hei  1.083  @xmath0 m , [ sivii ]  2.483  @xmath0 m ) , and these lines have not yet been observed in ngc  4388 .",
    "we perform detailed 1d mapping along pa = 64@xmath4 of the most relevant nir spectroscopic properties , searching for features of the morphology and gas kinematics that will help us to understand the origin and nature of the nuclear / circumnuclear gas , and its role within the agn and outflows already detected in this source .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sect",
    "[ sec : obs ] we describe the observations and data reduction . in sect .",
    "[ sec : nir_spec ] we describe the most important nir features detected in the spectra , analyses the main spectral ( line and continuum ) properties including the extinction affecting the gas and the main excitation mechanisms that produce the observed lines . sect  [ sec : kinematics ] discusses the kinematics of the neutral , low , medium and high ionization gas as well as the kinematics of the stellar component .",
    "sect  [ sec : coronal ] deals with the main ionization mechanisms of the high - excitation gas .",
    "sect  [ sec : final ] contains the main conclusions found from our work . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the tully - fisher distance to ngc4388 of 19  mpc @xcite , which translates into a spatial scale of 92 pc/. emission lines with wavelengths shortwards of 1  @xmath0 m will be quoted in angstroms (  ) while those longwards of that value will be quoted in microns ( @xmath0 m ) .",
    "ngc4388 was observed as part of a set of nir spectroscopic observations of galaxies from the palomar nearby galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "the spectra were obtained using the cross - dispersed mode of the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) on the gemini north 8.1 m telescope .",
    "this configuration provides a continuous spectral coverage from @xmath18400    to 2.48 @xmath0 m at a spectral resolution of @xmath11200 with a spatial scale of 0.15/pixel .",
    "the 0.3@xmath13 slit was set at a position angle pa = 64@xmath4 east of north and centered on the peak of the 1.6 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "the seeing during the galaxy observation was 0.6  as measured from the telluric a1v standard hip58616 , observed right before the galaxy at a similar airmass .",
    "left panel of figure  [ fig : slitpos ] shows the slit position overlaid on the wfpc / hst f606w ( 5935 ) image of ngc4388 .",
    "the contours correspond to wfpc / hst observations of [ oiii ]  @xmath55007 , described in @xcite .",
    "the observations used an object - sky - sky - object pattern , with the sky position 50  away from the galaxy nucleus , free of extended emission or background stars .",
    "four individual on - source integrations of 240  s each were carried out .",
    "the spectral reduction , extraction , and wavelength and flux calibration procedures were performed using version 1.9 of the `` xdgnirs '' code detailed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , the processing consists of removing cosmic ray - like features , dividing by a flat field , subtracting sky emission , and rectifying the tilted , curved spectra .",
    "wavelength calibration is achieved using argon arc spectra , and then a spectrum of each order is extracted , divided by a standard star to cancel telluric absorption lines , and roughly flux - calibrated using the telluric standard star spectrum .",
    "the pipeline merges the different spectral orders for each extraction window into a single 1d spectrum from 0.84  @xmath0 m to 2.48  @xmath0 m . in all cases",
    "the agreement in flux between the overlapping regions of two consecutive orders was very good , and scaling factors of @xmath14 3% were necessary .",
    "the brightest emission lines clearly extend all along the slit , so 10 off - nuclear extractions were made in the spatial direction , as shown in figure  [ fig : slitpos ] .",
    "`` n '' represents the region where the nuclear spectrum was extracted , centred at the peak of the continuum emission .",
    "the labels 1 to 11 mark the different extractions , with 1 to 5 to the ne and 7 to 11 to the sw .",
    "the aperture size of the extraction window used in all cases was 0.6 , similar to the seeing measured from the telluric standard .",
    "figure  [ fig : xd_nuclear ] shows the nuclear spectrum in the galaxy frame with the most conspicuous emission lines identified in the laboratory frame .",
    "figure  [ fig : xd_allspectra ] displays all extractions made along the spatial direction , also in the galaxy frame . a galactic extinction of @xmath15 of 0.09 from @xcite was found for this source . because it is negligible ,",
    "we have not corrected for this effect .",
    "figures  [ fig : xd_nuclear ] and  [ fig : xd_allspectra ] reveal that ngc4388 displays an outstanding emission line spectrum with prominent lines of [ siii]@xmath169068,9531   , hei1.083  @xmath0 m , [ feii]1.257@xmath0 m , pa@xmath17 , h@xmath182.122  @xmath0 m , [ sivi]1.963  @xmath0 m and [ sivii]2.48  @xmath0 m .",

    "extended emission of [ feii ] , pa@xmath17 , h@xmath182.122  @xmath0 m and [ sivi ] have previously been reported for this agn @xcite .",
    "our data , however , reveal that not only are those lines spatially resolved but also [ siii ] , [ ci ] , hei , [ six ] and [ sivii ] , which are detected at distances of up to 280  pc ne and sw of the nucleus .",
    "the presence of high ionization lines in the nuclear and off - nuclear spectra of ngc4388 is also evident from figures  [ fig : xd_nuclear ] and  [ fig : xd_allspectra ] .",
    "[ sivii]2.48  @xmath0 m , a coronal line with ip = 205ev is the second brightest forbidden line after [ siii]0.953  @xmath0 m .",
    "in addition to [ sivii ] , we also report here first detections of [ sviii]0.991  @xmath0 m , [ six]1.43  @xmath0 m and [ alix]2.048@xmath0 m .",
    "the latter two are rather compact , with no evidence of extended emission .",
    "[ six]1.252  @xmath0 m and [ caviii]2.32@xmath0 m are also detected in our data in the nuclear and off - nuclear apertures .",
    "these lines were previously reported by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "in addition to the emission lines , the continuum emission of ngc4388 displays stellar absorption features of co and cat in the extreme red and blue portions of the nir spectra , respectively .",
    "moreover , absorption lines of mgi , co , and sii are also evident in the @xmath19-band .",
    "the cn band at 1.1@xmath0 m is prominent in the nuclear and circumnuclear apertures , indicating the presence of red giant and/or asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : perfil_luz ] displays the light distribution along the spatial direction of the brightest emission lines detected in this object . for comparison , the light profile of the continuum at different wavelengths is also shown .",
    "it can be seen that the nlr of ngc4388 has a complex , irregular structure . for most lines , the brightest emission coincides with the peak of the continuum light ( and",
    "we identify this location as the active nucleus ) .",
    "the exception is the [ siii]@xmath59531 line , which reaches its maximum @xmath150  pc sw of the continuum peak .",
    "in fact , many of the lines show secondary peaks @xmath150  pc sw of the nucleus . such peaks are particularly prominent in hei , [ sivi ] and [ sivii ] .",
    "a third peak is observed at @xmath1150  pc sw from the nucleus , most noticeable in pa@xmath17 , [ feii ] and [ sivii ] but also detected in other lines .",
    "a fourth peak of emission at @xmath1150  pc ne of the nucleus is detected , quite prominent in [ siii ] and also observed in hei , hi , [ feii ] , [ sivi ] and [ sivii ] .",
    "+      the asymmetry of the line distributions , with excess emission towards the sw compared with the ne , is most pronounced at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this reflects the dusty nature of ngc4388 , whose inner few hundred parsecs from the centre to the ne are highly obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "strong dust lanes crossing the nuclear and circumnuclear region are evident in the wfpc / hst images of @xcite .",
    "the fact that the nir region is significantly less affected by dust allows us to map this hidden region in a variety of emission lines , something that has not been possible using optical spectroscopy .",
    "the very rich nuclear and extended emission line spectrum found in the nir for ngc4388 is not surprising .",
    "@xcite , using optical imaging and spectrophotometry , described the complexity of the extended , ionized gas clouds surrounding the nucleus , reaching distances on the kiloparsec scale , well above the plane of the galaxy . when compared to other well - known seyfert nuclei , ngc4388 has one of the most richly structured circumnuclear regions yet observed",
    "our data offer a unique opportunity to extend and compare previous results on the kinematics and ionization structure of ngc4388 based on molecular and low - ionization gas to the high - ionization gas covering a wide range of ionization potentials .      in order to accurately measure weak emission lines ,",
    "it is necessary to remove the stellar continuum . as we only wish to obtain a good representation of the stellar spectrum , rather than",
    "extract information about the stellar population itself , we fit the spectrum with the irtf library of empirical stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "this library contains 0.8 - 5.0  @xmath20 spectra of 210 stars of spectral type f , g , k , m and s / c .",
    "we used a subset of 60 stars , removing similar spectra of stars with the same spectral types .",
    "to this we added theoretical spectra of hotter stars ( t@xmath21 = 9000k , 10000k and 20000k , log@xmath22=3.0 and 4.5 dex , solar metallicity - calculated as in coelho 2014 , ( private communication ) which might be important if a younger stellar population is present in the galaxy .",
    "the stellar population modeling was done using the spectral synthesis code starlight @xcite .",
    "in addition to the stars we included a power - law in the form of @xmath23 to represent the agn featureless continuum .",
    "extinction is modelled by starlight as due to foreground dust , and parametrized by the @xmath24band extinction a@xmath25 .",
    "we use the @xcite extinction law . to accurately model the stellar continuum ,",
    "the emission lines are masked out of the fit .",
    "we also masked the regions of strong telluric absorption , where their correction was not possible , and the bluest part of the spectrum ( @xmath26 ) , where the flux calibration can be most uncertain .",
    "examples of the fit obtained can be seen in figure  [ fig : substellar ] , where the stellar template derived for the aperture 9 , centred at 166  pc sw , can be observed . the observed spectrum ( black line )",

    "in addition , liner also provides values for the peak position and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of each profile function fit . in ngc4388",
    "one gaussian was necessary to represent the observed profiles for most lines .",

    "@xcite presented examples of [ sivi ]  1.963  @xmath0 m emission line profiles along the ionised cone , giving additional support to this scenario .",
    "it then makes sense to consider the role of shocks produced by interactions between the radio jet or a radially accelerated outflow and the ism to enhance the high - ionization lines strengths in the off - nuclear apertures .",
    "note , for example , that @xcite showed the necessity of fast shocks ( @xmath1 1000kms@xmath56 ) at distances larger than 100  pc from the nucleus in ngc1068 to explain the high [ nev ] and [ fevii ] strengths relative to h@xmath17 measured in that object .",

    ", cv01 considered that the clouds are moving outwards from the galaxy centre , with the shock front forming on the outer edge of the cloud , whereas the ionizing radiation reaches the opposite edge that faces the active centre .",
    "the ionization due to both the primary radiation ( from the central source ) and the diffuse radiation generated by the free - free and free - bound transitions of the shocked and photoionized gas , as well as the collisional ionization , are all accounted for .",
    "the shock velocity @xmath114 and the ionizing flux from the central source at the lyman limit reaching the cloud , @xmath115 ( in units of @xmath116 s@xmath56 ev@xmath56 ) , are the main input parameters .",

    "the shock velocities are significantly higher than those found by @xcite in their modelling of the optical spectra of the sw cone of ngc4388 .",
    "composite models that account for the combined effects of photoionization and shocks were able to reproduce the observed , high [ oiii]@xmath55007/h@xmath17 ratio , marginally consistent with simple photoionization .",
    "the alignment between radio - jets and the morphology of the ionized gas has also been observed in other seyfert galaxies by means of 3d ifu observations @xcite .",
    "one example is ngc1068 , well - known for displaying a prominent radio - jet in the nuclear and circumnuclear region , with most of the nlr ionized gas following the morphology and structure of the radio - emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite had already found enhanced coronal line emission where the radio jet changes direction , while @xcite showed the necessity of shocks to reproduce the enhanced coronal line ratios as far as 150  pc from the agn .",
    "the case for ngc4388 is not much different .",
    "the observed coronal emission follows that of the radio - jet , as observed here from our data and from @xcite .",
    "moreover , outflowing ionized gas has been systematically reported in this object .",
    "for the data presented here , evidence of outflowing gas is easily seen in figure  [ fig : residuals ] , when the disk rotation is subtracted from the observed velocity radial velocity measured in the coronal lines .",
    "blueshifted gas is clearly seen in the ne while redshifted gas is detected towards the sw .",
    "the outflowing component is the largest for the high - ionization lines and enhanced towards the sw , where the extinction is significantly reduced .",
    "we should keep in mind , though , that the shock model coupled to radiation from the central source predictions provide us with only a first - order approximation . in order to have a full description of the cl region based on model - fitting",
    ", we should suitably combine clouds under different physical conditions ( i.e. , clouds with different @xmath123 and @xmath117 ) with the proper weight so that the emission lines and the observed continuum can be reproduced @xcite .",
    "this is far beyond the scope of this paper and is left for a future publication .",
    "what is most important here is that we have collected solid evidence of the necessity of shocks coupled to photoinization by the agn in order to reproduce cl flux ratios at distances as far as a few hundred parsecs , where photoionization by the central source predicts no or very faint cl emission .",
    "unrealistic physical conditions need to be assumed for the gas if we want to explain the observed high - ionization lines in terms of only one mechanism .",
    "we have carried out the first spectroscopic analysis of the nuclear and circumnuclear region of the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc4388 covering simultaneously the wavelength interval 0.84@xmath552.45  @xmath0 m , part of it never being reported in the literature .",
    "the lower sensitivy of nir to dust allowed us to unveil the north - east region of this source , traditionally hidden at optical wavelengths , in detail and using a wide variety of emission lines both of low- and high - ionization .",

    "they all extend from the nucleus to the ne and sw ends of the slit . along the spatial direction",
    ", the nlr gas has a complex , irregular structure , with at least two knots of emission , with the brightest one coinciding with the peak of the continuum light distribution .",
    "the asymmetry of the light profile distributions , with excess emission towards the sw compared with the ne , is most pronounced at shorter wavelengths .",
    "some of the structures detected are seen at the first time in our data .",
    "we determined the average extinction for the inner 560  pc of ngc4388 from both the hi and [ feii ] lines .",
    "the results confirm that the central regions of ngc4388 are dusty , with the dust distributed inhomogeneously , peaking at the nucleus with an e(b - v ) of 1.81@xmath320.3 mag .",
    "it then decreases both to the ne and sw although it remains high mainly to the ne , consistent with the fact that this inner region is seen through the galaxy disk .",
    "to the sw at 220  pc from the nucleus we see a highly dusty region with e(b - v ) reaching 0.8@xmath320.3 mag .",
    "the emission line ratios [ siii]/pa@xmath17 , [ sivi]/br@xmath10 and [ sivii]/br@xmath10 show that in the inner 500  pc of ngc4388 the gas distribution is highly inhomogeneous , with at least two regions of enhanced high - ionization emission lines : one in the centre , and another at @xmath1250  pc ne of the nucleus .",
    "a third peak of enhanced ionization is observed to the sw , and is evident in the [ siii]/pa@xmath17 and [ feii]/pa@xmath17 line ratios .",
    "the enhancement in ionization suggests strong interaction between the radio - jet and the circumnuclear nlr gas .",
    "we are able to analyze the gas kinematics based on several lines of moderate to very high excitation .",
    "the results show that there is a significant parcel of gas that is not rotation - dominated and located out of the disk of the galaxy .",
    "high - ionization lines display flat pv curves , suggesting that the bulk of this emission consists of outflowing gas .",
    "double - peak [ feii ] lines sw of the nucleus give additional support to this picture . only the molecular hydrogen and the stellar component",
    "follow a rotation pattern consistent with disk rotation .",
    "the forbidden high - ionization line spectrum observed in ngc4388 is outstanding , not only because of the strength of the emission lines but also because of the size of the emission region where it is detected .",
    "[ sivi ] and [ sivii ] , for example , fill up the field - of - view covered by the slit , that is , nearly 600  pc along the spatial direction .",
    "few agns in the literature are reported to display such a large coronal line region .",
    "these observations can not be explained solely as due to photoinization by radiation from the central engine .",
    "models that consider only this excitation mechanism fail at reproducing off - nuclear line ratios",
    ". therefore , an additional source of gas excitation must be present .",
    "models that include the effects of shocks coupled to photoionization by the central source are able to account for the observations .",
    "this result is supported by observational evidence that suggests interactions between the radio jet and the ism in the central few hundred parsecs of this agn .",
    "the picture that emerges from our observations highlights the very complex nature of the nuclear and circumnuclear region of ngc4388 .",
    "this agn is one of the best pieces of evidence of the intricate mixture of an agn , a radio - jet , dust and a rich ism .",
