    "data from tidal stream debris is a valuable resource for constraining galactic structure . in the last decade ,",
    "several streams , with both globular cluster and dwarf galaxy progenitors , have been discovered in the milky way @xcite , as well as in nearby galaxies @xcite . by examining the density , kinematics , distribution , and structure of various tidal streams surrounding the milky way , a clearer picture of how our halo was built",
    "can be developed @xcite .",
    "in addition , stellar streams can be used as probes of the galactic gravitational potential , and thus constrains the shape of the dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite , hereafter gd , announced the detection of a @xmath0 cold stellar stream in the galactic halo ( the stream itself we refer to henceforth as gd-1 , following gd ) , using stellar density counts extracted from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "this stream is extremely narrow , less than @xmath5 degrees in width , which is less than 50 pc at their measured distances of 7.3 to 9.1 kpc from the sun .",
    "gd therefore concluded that the progenitor was a globular cluster , but the progenitor remains unidentified and could be completely disrupted .    in this work",
    ", we utilize newly available sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ; see yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) spectroscopy of stars identified along the stream , that are available in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) , to constrain the orbit of the stream and search for possible progenitors .",
    "the sdss imaging survey @xcite has made it possible to detect faint milky way halo streams from the spatial distribution of stars because it provides very accurate multicolor photometry for millions of galactic stars .",
    "even with the well - calibrated sdss photometry @xcite , gd separated the faint structure from the background of milky way halo and disk stars only with careful filtering and smoothing techniques @xcite . to characterize the stream in more detail and to compute an orbit , we reanalyze the imaging data , supplemented through dr7 , and then add to it all newly available spectroscopic observations of gd-1 stream stars available in sdss dr7 .      using the analysis of gd as a guide",
    ", stars were selected from the sdss dr7 @xcite footprint from a rough color - magnitude box restricted to blue f turnoff and upper main sequence stars at distances of 7 to 20 kpc from the sun ( taking into account that the turnoff spans more than a magnitude of absolute magnitudes ) : @xmath6 .",
    "magnitudes with @xmath7 subscript indicate those which have been corrected for reddening using the @xcite maps as implemented in sdss ( dr7 ) .",
    "all sdss stars in the dr7 north galactic cap footprint which are in this color - magnitude box were selected and plotted in an ( @xmath8 ) stellar density diagram with pixels @xmath9 on a side .",
    "examination of this diagram by eye showed that gd-1 stream stood out weakly from the background , with enough contrast so that the location of several fiducial points along the stream in ( @xmath8 ) could be mapped .",
    "low - order polynomials were then fit to the positions of these points .",
    "the lowest order best fit was of third order : @xmath10 by comparison with likely identified spectroscopic stream members we later verified that this polynomial matches the stream position within about @xmath11 for @xmath12 , and within about @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "next , 147,537 stars within @xmath16 of this polynomial fit ( a conservative width is used to increase the signal to noise , it is not necessary to identify every star ) were selected from @xmath17 .",
    "they represent the ` on - stream ' data set . for a control sample ( ` off - stream ' ) , 158,147 stars were selected within @xmath18 degrees of a curve offset by 5 degrees in @xmath19 from the ` on - stream ' data over a similar @xmath20 range . a hess diagram in ( @xmath21 ) of the difference between the on and off stream data @xcite",
    "was generated and the results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows a clear faint turnoff around @xmath22 and upper main sequence descending to @xmath23 .",
    "other features in figure 1 include an imperfectly subtracted thick disk residual at @xmath24 from @xmath25 and a residual from nearby m dwarfs at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the stars below the turnoff are concentrated in a relatively narrow band of color and magnitude , as expected for a stream localized in distance from the sun .",
    "since the stream varies in distance from 7 to about 10 kpc for the stars in this figure , the actual width of the main sequence is substantially narrower than demonstrated here .",
    "the blue turnoff of @xmath28 suggests a lower metallicity or younger age than that of the spheroid , which has a turnoff of @xmath29 and @xmath30 \\sim -1.6 $ ] .",
    "we superimpose with black dots in figure 1 a fiducial sequence from the cluster m92 .",
    "the m92 sequence was calculated by starting with the fiducial sequence in undereddened @xmath31 from @xcite , converting it to @xmath32 using e(b - v ) of 0.02 and a distance to m92 of 8.2 kpc , as tabulated by @xcite , and then shifting it to the approximate distance to the gd-1 stream , which is approximately 9 kpc over this range of ra ( distance modulus @xmath33 ) .",
    "this low - metallicity cluster , with @xmath30 = -2.3 $ ] @xcite , fits the main sequence and the turnoff reasonably well .",
    "we do not see the giant branch or the horizontal branch ( which should be at @xmath34 ) in this figure , but given the faintness of the stream that is not unexpected .",
    "we now refine the rough color - magnitude box used to detect the stream in equatorial coordinates .",
    "the refined box is selected to allow for a stream which changes distance by @xmath35 over @xmath36 .",
    "the box is defined as the union of three selection regions heavily outlined in figure 1 : a ) @xmath37 ( turn off ) b ) @xmath38 ( lower turn off ) and c ) @xmath39 ( upper main sequence ) .",
    "all stars with images in the sdss dr7 northern galactic cap region which meet these criteria ( and have @xmath40 to exclude quasars ) , are selected and plotted in @xmath41 in the upper panel of figure 2 .",
    "the gd-1 stream is faintly visible , running in an arc from about @xmath42 through @xmath43 , then down to @xmath44 where it crosses in front of the sagittarius stream , and then it is not clearly visible as it is lost in monoceros and other galactic halo stars near @xmath45",
    ". the lower panel of figure 2 presents the same data in a galactic polar projection .",
    "the gd-1 stream is clearly visible .",
    "there are several features in the density of stars along the stream of unknown origin",
    ". they could be the remains of a nearly dissolved progenitor , the result of interactions between the stream and the potential of the milky way s disk and halo , or unassociated spheroid substructure .",
    "the kinematics of the stream , detailed below , reveal that it is on a retrograde orbit moving through the sequence of points in the order just described for the upper panel of figure 2 .",
    "numerous other dwarf galaxies , streams and halo overdensities are present in figure 2 ; these will not be discussed further here .      the segue survey @xcite , which is one of three surveys carried out as part of sdss - ii , obtained spectra of approximately 240,000 milky way stars toward @xmath46 sightlines that each covered seven square degrees of the sky , with an emphasis on obtaining spectra of fainter halo stars . while most of segue s 200 observing tiles were randomly distributed across the sdss imaging footprint , a few were placed on streams of known interest , including the gd-1 stream .",
    "all segue spectra were processed through the standard sdss spectroscopic reduction pipelines @xcite , from which radial velocities accurate to about @xmath47 for objects at @xmath48 were determined .",
    "in addition , the stellar spectra were processed through the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ) @xcite in order to obtain abundance ( [ fe / h ] ) , surface gravity ( log g ) , and other atmospheric parameter estimates .",
    "we select from the sdss - ii / segue dr7 database all measured parameters of the @xmath49 spectra of stars within @xmath50 of the gd-1 stream described by eq .",
    "1 . we further refined the selection to exclude objects far away from the fiducial m92 curve of figure 1 by requiring that they meet these color magnitude cuts : @xmath51 or @xmath52 or @xmath53 or @xmath54 or @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "the region bounded by these cuts is outlined with a light line in figure 1 .",
    "most of the 4568 remaining spectra are concentrated in @xmath57 diameter patches centered on segue tiles , but some are part of the sdss - i and sdss - ii legacy surveys .",
    "these latter surveys targeted nearly the entire sdss footprint spectroscopically , but with few and limited signal - to - noise on stellar targets ( since the sdss legacy survey primarily targets galaxy and quasar candidates ) .",
    "we show in figure 3 the line - of - sight , galactic standard of rest velocities , @xmath58 , for each star in the sample , as a function of galactic longitude .",
    "we calculate @xmath58 using : @xmath59 , where rv is the heliocentric radial velocity in @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the standard , sun - centered galactic coordinates of each star . a sine curve with amplitude 110 @xmath60 traces an approximate locus of nearby disk stars co - rotating with the sun .",
    "spheroid stars occupy a broad range of @xmath62 centered at @xmath63 .",
    "seven regions of interest are marked along the bottom of figure 3 , indicating areas with segue plates , where stars identified with the gd-1 stream will be selected .",
    "the positions of these seven regions on the sky in equatorial coordinates are also indicated with circles and numbered in the upper panel of figure 2 .",
    "regions 5 and 6 were specially targeted by segue with a tile directly on locations along the gd-1 stream .    from examination of figure 3",
    ", it appears that there is an excess of stars off the rotating disk locus at @xmath64 in regions 5 and 6 . to confirm that these are in fact gd-1 stream stars",
    ", we isolate the stars in regions 5 and 6 and plot their velocity histogram in figure 4 .",
    "the distribution in figure 4 is overlayed with gaussians for the thick disk ( dispersion of @xmath65 and an offset of @xmath66 ) , and inner halo ( dispersion of @xmath67 ) .",
    "a significant peak is detected at @xmath68 which we associate with the gd-1 stream member stars .",
    "we next examine the metallicity distribution of stars in this velocity peak in order to estimate the elemental abundance of the gd-1 stream . later in the paper",
    "we will show that the individual @xmath62 velocities in regions 5 and 6 are @xmath69 and @xmath70 km s@xmath71 , respectively , so we chose a  peak \" velocity range of @xmath72 km s@xmath71 .",
    "figure 5 shows the sspp abundance estimates for all stars with good metallicity estimates ( for a good estimate a turnoff star generally needs to be brighter than about @xmath73 ) .",
    "errors on individual stars @xmath30 $ ] are approximately 0.3 dex for spectral type f objects with @xmath74 .",
    "the histogram for all abundances of stars in regions 5 and 6 are plotted with a light line ( 1311 stars ) , those for stars in the velocity peak of figure 4 are indicated with a heavy line ( 115 stars ) .",
    "the stars with velocities of the gd-1 stream are heavily biased towards lower metallicity stars , compared with those of the thick disk ( @xmath30 \\sim -0.7 $ ] ) , or inner halo ( @xmath30 \\sim -1.6 $ ] ) .",
    "we estimate from figure 4 that about 30 stars in the spectroscopic dataset are from the gd-1 stream . to see the metallicitydistribution of the stars in the gd-1 stream",
    ", we subtract a scaled version of the histogram with the light line from the histogram with the heavy line .",
    "the scaling factor is ( 115 - 30)/(1311 - 30 ) . since the stars in the velocity selected region contain a smaller fraction of thick disk stars , the subtracted histogram is oversubtracted at high metallcities , and likely undersubtracted at spheroid metallcitites .",
    "the mean of the stars in the shaded region is [ fe / h]=-1.9 , but the real metallicity of the stream is probably somewhat lower than this .",
    "bins with negative counts do not appear in figure 5 .",
    "we now return to the sample of stars in figure 3 , and select only those of very low metallicity ( @xmath75 < -1.65 $ ] ) in order to isolate stream members from the thick disk and halo field star populations . the low metallicity spectra with positions , colors , and magnitudes that make them candidates for gd-1 stream members",
    "are shown in figure 6 .",
    "several velocity peaks are now clearly separated from the disk and spheroid .",
    "we now examine stars in each of the seven regions numbered in figure 6 and determine their observational properties .",
    "we estimated the distance to the gd-1 stream at the positions of each of the seven regions that it overlaps using a matched filter algorithm .",
    "we first generated the hess diagram from sdss dr7 data from a region about @xmath76 wide in ra and 1@xmath77 wide in dec in the vicinity of each plate , centered on the polynomial fit to the gd-1 stream .",
    "then the hess diagram of the background was generated from two regions of sky with the same angular extent on the sky , but offset 1.5@xmath77 higher and 1.5@xmath77 lower in declination . the background hess diagram ( divided by two to correct for the difference in sky area )",
    "was subtracted from the corresponding hess diagram on the gd-1 stream .",
    "the subtracted hess diagrams are shown in figure 7 .",
    "since the gd-1 stream is of quite low metallicity , we selected the globular cluster m92 ( [ fe / h]@xmath78 ) to compare with the observations .",
    "we then constructed a m92 filter hess diagram with the similar method to @xcite .",
    "we first broaden the m92 fiducial sequence from @xcite with the sdss photometric errors .",
    "because we do not have a luminosity function for m92 stars , we used the luminosity function of m13 , estimated from sdss survey counts vs. magnitude for stars away from the core of m13 , to create the hess diagram .",
    "as before , we assume the distance to m92 is 8.2 kpc .",
    "the m92 filter was shifted from -0.5 to 1.5 magnitudes in r in steps of 0.05 mag . for each shift ,",
    "we cross - correlated the m92 filter with the subtracted hess diagram : @xmath79\\cdot f(g - r , r+{\\delta}r)\\ ] ] and estimated the error of cross - correlation function as : @xmath80\\cdot f^2(g - r , r+{\\delta}r)\\}^{0.5}.\\ ] ] in the above equations , o and b represent the hess diagrams of orbit and background segments , respectively .",
    "f is the value of m92 filter .",
    "then we define the maximum position , @xmath81 , of the cross - correlation function to be the actual distance modulus to the stream . near the maximum",
    ", we can estimate the cross - correlation function by the taylor expansion : @xmath82 the second term in the right equals zero , since the first derivative is zero at maximum .",
    "we use the above taylor expansion , using only the lowest order non - zero terms , to estimate the error in the cross - correlation function : @xmath83 since @xmath84 , @xmath85    the distance and corresponding error of each of the seven points along the stream with segue spectra are listed in table 1 .",
    "figure 8 shows the same data as figure 7 , but overplotted with the m92 fiducial sequence shifted to the best estimated distance for each sky position .",
    "figure 9 shows velocity histograms of low metallicity stars from figure 6 within @xmath86 of each selected region .",
    "a gaussian velocity histogram , representing a halo distribution with @xmath87 and are normalized so that the area under the curve equals the number of stars in the histogram , is also shown .",
    "the region number is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel , and the velocity of the peak most likely associated with the gd-1 stream is also indicated .",
    "we list below some details of each region s selection , including the sdss / segue plates on which most of the objects were detected .    in each region with a clear stream detection ,",
    "the velocity and velocity dispersion for the gd-1 stream were computed using an iterative method that used only stars within one standard deviation of the mean velocity .",
    "we computed the mean and standard deviation of the stars near the velocity peak .",
    "then , we selected stars that were within one standard deviation of the mean and re - computed the mean and standard deviation",
    ". the standard deviation calculated this way is an underestimate , since we have removed the tails of the distribution .",
    "we corrected the standard deviation assuming gaussian tails .",
    "this process was repeated until the computed mean and standard deviation matched the mean and standard deviation used to select the stars in the stream .",

    "@xcite postulated the progenitor of this stream is a globular cluster because it has a narrow width in the sky .",
    "as a cluster orbits the galaxy , stars farther from the progenitor will depart from the orbit due to dynamical friction and scattering of the stream stars . because the progenitor is presumed to be a compact object with a few km s@xmath71 velocity dispersion , it is reasonable to assume that the stars in the tidal stream lie approximately on the orbit of the globular cluster @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies , on the other hand , will experience larger spatial dispersions because they have larger dispersions in their energies . therefore , in this paper , we fit the orbit to the positions and velocities of the stars in the tidal stream .",
    "the galactic potential model used in this work follows directly from @xcite .",

    "the principle initial values for the parameters in region 5 are @xmath154 = ( 8.0 kpc , -94 km / s , -285 km / s , -104 km / s ) . in practice",
    "we start searching for the best parameters in a range of values near these approximate values for the orbital parameters .",
    "the parameter selection ranges are given in table [ fitpars ] .      in order to find the best - fit orbit to the data given in table 1 ,",
    "it is necessary to define a goodness - of - fit metric , and search the relevant parameters for the minimum value of this metric .",
    "the metric for an orbit of this type involves three important factors : the orbit passing through the plate locations in the sky , having the proper velocities at these locations , and having the correct distances . in order to consider all of these factors , we define three chi - squared values , one for each of the relevant variables , and simply sum them to create the total goodness of fit metric . specifically ,    @xmath160    @xmath161    @xmath162    @xmath163    where @xmath164 , @xmath127 being the number of data points , and @xmath165 being the number of parameters .    to calculate these @xmath166 values",
    ", we calculate a model orbit using the selected parameters .",
    "we search the orbit for the @xmath167 values from the plates , and use the associated values of @xmath148 , @xmath62 , and @xmath144 to compute @xmath166 .",
    "we now optimize the orbital parameters so that @xmath166 is minimized . to do this",
    ", we choose an initial set of parameters , calculate an orbit using the nemo stellar dynamics toolbox @xcite , and calculate @xmath166 .",
    "we then use a gradient descent method to adjust the parameters to new values , generate a new orbit , and recalculate @xmath166 .",
    "this process is continued until the true minimum value of @xmath166 is found , and the associated parameters describe the best fit orbit .",
    "let the vector @xmath168 describe the parameters .",
    "for each @xmath169 there is an associated @xmath170 .",
    "we choose an initial set of parameters @xmath171 , and find @xmath172 .",
    "we then iterate the parameters by equation ( [ gradientdescent ] ) .",
    "@xmath173    we calculate the gradient using a finite difference method , shown in equation ( [ finitedifference ] ) .    @xmath174    different values of @xmath175 are used because the parameters are on different scales , it would not be appropriate to use the same step size for them all .",
    "the step sizes for the parameters are given in table [ fitpars ] .",
    "@xmath176 is a variable - learning parameter .",
    "it initially begins at @xmath177 , and if the new value of @xmath178 is smaller than the old , then @xmath176 is multiplied by @xmath179 , if not , it is multiplied by @xmath180 .",
    "the purpose of this is to ensure if a minimum is being found , then it is found faster than with a constant - learning parameter .",
    "we also multiply it by the associated @xmath175 value to make the step size appropriate for the parameter being considered .",
    "the uncertainties of the best - fit parameters can be estimated from the shape of the @xmath166 surface at its minimum . to do this ,",
    "we follow the method outlined by @xcite .",
    "we construct a matrix @xmath181 of second partial derivatives of the @xmath166 surface , evaluated at the minimum found by the gradient descent . the error estimate for the @xmath182 parameter",
    "is @xmath183 .",
    "the @xmath181 matrix is defined as    @xmath184    the matrix @xmath185 is the hessian matrix , whose elements are given by    @xmath186",
    "we select five initial sets of parameters by randomly choosing values within the ranges given in table [ fitpars ] .",
    "we perform the gradient descent to reach the best fit parameters .",
    "we then estimate the parameter errors using the hessian method outlined above .",
    "the best - fit parameters and their errors are @xmath187 .",
    "the chi - squared of this fit is 2.07 .",
    "the negative velocities indicate a retrograde orbit .",
    "the perigalacticon for this orbit is located @xmath188 kpc from the galactic center at @xmath189 , near region 6 .",
    "the space velocity of stars in the model at this position is 276 @xmath60 .",
    "the apogalacticon is at @xmath190 kpc from the galactic center , toward @xmath191 , though we do not observe this direction on the sky .",
    "all errors are @xmath192 .",
    "these orbital parameters are fairly insensitive to the choices of parameters in the galactic potential . in particular , they are good estimates of the orbital parameters for a wide range of @xmath152 and @xmath150 .",
    "to investigate whether we could determine anything about the shape of the dark matter halo from this tidal tail , we performed parameter sweeps on @xmath152 and @xmath150 while keeping the kinematic parameters constant ( figure 11 ) .",
    "we see that very low flattenings are inconsistent with the data , but a wide range of @xmath152 and @xmath150 are allowed .",
    "the potential assumed in fitting the orbit is a standard logarithmic flat - rotation curve dark matter halo plus a stellar disk .",
    "since the gd-1 stream approaches within 15 kpc of the galactic center , the effects of the massive disk are felt by the orbit , and increasing the relative mass of the disk vs. the halo can mimic the effects of a flattened halo . at perigalacticon ,",
    "the disk exerts twice as much gravitational force as the halo . given this , it is not surprising that the stream orbit depends minimally on the halo parameters .",
    "more models and constraints , from this and other streams , are clearly needed to constrain the shape of the dark matter halo .",
    "the upper panel of figure 12 shows the orbit in @xmath61 with the stream locations shown .",
    "the model prediction is in very good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "the middle and lower panels of figure 11 show the orbit in @xmath167 versus @xmath58 and @xmath167 versus distance from the sun .",
    "we also see good agreement with the experimental observation .",
    "figure 13 shows the orbit projected into the three planes of galactic coordinates @xmath141 .",
    "we deduce an orbital eccentricity @xmath193 ( one sigma error ) and an inclination to the galactic plane of @xmath194 .",
    "arrows show the relative direction of the stream s retrograde motion compared to the milky way .",
    "the final columns of table 1 show the predicted proper motions ( @xmath97 ) for stars in the stream at each region 1 - 7 based on the distances in table 1 .",
    "these predictions may be compared with actual observed proper motions for stream star candidates in table 2 at each region . in general",
    "the agreement is quite good for regions 2 - 6 , given proper motion errors of @xmath195 in each coordinate .",
    "spectral candidates more than @xmath196 away were excluded from figure 10 , dropping about 20% of the candidates , leaving a generally good fit to a shifted m92 fiducial sequence for these regions .",
    "region 7 had fewer good proper motion matches , and it is possible that we are not seeing gd-1 stream candidates here .",
    "figure 14 shows the photometrically chosen stars with proper motions available near regions 1,4,5 and 6 , along with an equivalent set of field stars ( chosen 5 degrees away ) for comparison .",
    "there s a clear excess of ` on - stream ' stars in the lower right quadrant of each region on - stream  these are likely stream members .",
    "the estimated tangential velocities ( relative to the sun ) are given .",
    "to search for a possible progenitor , we selected all milky way globular clusters from @xcite that had metallicities in the range @xmath197[fe / h]@xmath198",
    ". only seven of these globular clusters ( terzan 8 , arp2 , ngc 6809 , ngc 6749 , ngc 6341 , ngc 6681 , and ngc 6752 ) are within @xmath76 of the gd-1 orbit .",
    "additionally , we considered ngc 2298 , which is @xmath199 from the orbit , and has a metallicity of @xmath30 = -1.85 $ ] .",
    "we compared the positions and velocities of these globular clusters with an orbital path that extends all the way around the milky way . to create a stream of",
    "this length would require a globular cluster to orbit the milky way for on the order of gigayears , with the length depending on the concentration of the progenitor , as well as the shape and location of the progenitor s orbit .",
    "of the eight globular clusters , ngc 6809 , ngc 6749 , and ngc 6752 are ruled out because their distances are more than a factor of two different from the distance to the orbit .",
    "the remaining five clusters had radial velocities that are inconsistent with the predicted orbit by more than 50 km / s . we therefore conclude that the milky way globular cluster catalog published by @xcite does not contain the progenitor of this stream .",
    "we use spectroscopic kinematic and abundance information to isolate stars in the gd-1 stream , and use the positions and velocities of those stars to derive orbital parameters for its orbit .",
    "the gd-1 stream is moving very rapidly on a retrograde orbit around the milky way . in the region of the orbit which is detected",
    ", it has a distance of about 7 - 11 kpc from the sun .",
    "the stream s orbit takes it to apogalactic distances of @xmath200 kpc , and it has a perigalacticon of @xmath201 kpc , implying an eccentricity of @xmath202 .",
    "the inclination to the galactic plane is about @xmath203 .",
    "the metallicity of the stream is [ fe / h]@xmath204 plus systematic errors of a few tenths dex .",
    "none of the known globular clusters in the milky way have positions , radial velocities , and metallicities that are consistent with being the progenitor of the gd-1 stream .",
    "the consistency between the proper motions of these stream candidates and our best fit model gives us further confidence that we have identified stream members and that our model accurately represents the path on the sky of the stream stars .",
    "while we claim only consistency here between the proper motion data and our model , we note that more detailed fits to the proper motion ( in addition to the radial velocities ) for such nearby streams can be a crucial tool in constraining the halo potential shape and other parameters .",
