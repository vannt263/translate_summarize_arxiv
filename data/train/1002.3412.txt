    "seeking analytical as well as numerical solutions of nonlinear systems has continued to attract attention through the last few decades @xcite .",
    "mathematically , nonlinear equations do not normally have solutions which would superpose making the systems they represent rather complicated and difficult to analyze @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an extensive study of a number of nonlinear systems has revealed that there do exist solutions which are not only interesting in their own right but have a wide range of applicability @xcite . to generate exact solutions and to understand their properties several important techniques",
    "have been developed such as the inverse scattering approach @xcite , lax pair formulation @xcite , backlund transformations @xcite and hirota s bilinear method @xcite .",
    "nonlinear equations have also been shown to arise from a boundary value problem @xcite possessing hierarchy of conservation laws @xcite .",
    "an important class of solutions of nonlinear evolution equations is concerned with those of the travelling waves that reduce the guiding partial differential equation of two variables namely , @xmath0 and @xmath1 to an ordinary differential equation of one independent variable @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a parameter signifying the speed with which the wave travels either to the right or left .",
    "a number of methods has been employed in the literature to obtain the travelling wave solutions of various types . of these",
    "the tanh - method stands out as one of the very effective tools for solving certain classes of nonlinear evolution and wave equation @xcite .",
    "others include the variational iteration method for a class of linear and nonlinear equations @xcite , homogeneous balance method @xcite , the hyperbolic method @xcite , the trigonometric method @xcite , darboux s transformation @xcite , f - function method @xcite , @xmath4-expansion method @xcite , a unified algebraic method @xcite and more .",
    "recently the existence of travelling wave solutions for the generalized shallow water wave ( gsww ) equation @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6 has been noted .",
    "the derivation of ( [ gsww ] ) follows from the classical water wave theory with the aid of boussinesq approximation . in an interesting review ,",
    "clarkson and mansfield @xcite considered the various classical and non - classical reductions of the gsww equation wherein they also investigated the painlev tests to examine the complete integrability of ( [ gsww ] ) which holds if and only if @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "they explored some simple and non - trivial family of solutions of ( [ gsww ] ) while in @xcite a class of exact travelling wave solutions were obtained by making use of the homogeneous balance method and a modified hyperbolic method .    in this article",
    "we plan to study the travelling wave solutions @xmath9 of the gsww equation ( [ gsww ] ) in a more general framework .",
    "we show that the canonical procedure namely , the classical technique @xcite , based on an integration within a suitable range not only recovers both known periodic ( including elliptic and trigonometric ) and non - periodic hyperbolic solutions , but also unfolds several new elliptic and rational solutions .",
    "however such a constructive method has its limitations in the sense that the range of validity of the obtained solutions is fixed by the analysis of the zeros of the governing cubic polynomial in @xmath10 beforehand and so , in practical applications , a particular solution proves difficult to implement .",
    "one of our aims is to go beyond this standard path by proposing an extended method based on the use of jacobian elliptic functions .",
    "we refer to it as an extended elliptic function ( eef ) method . in this context",
    "the works of refs @xcite and @xcite worth to be mentioned which used the elliptic functions for a class of nonlinear evolution equations .",
    "these works consider a finite series expansion in the form @xmath11 to generate travelling wave solutions . in ( [ pos - power ] )",
    "the positive integer @xmath12 is determined by balancing the coefficients @xmath13 s after substituting the expansion in the given nonlinear equation and comparing the relevant powers .",
    "our eef method generalizes this approach by including the negative powers of @xmath14 thereby addressing the full - range series as given in the following @xmath15 in equation  ( [ finite - series ] ) , f is an unknown functional constrained to satisfy the relation @xmath16 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath17 throughout the text .",
    "the important feature of the eef method is that it includes not only the positive integral powers of @xmath14 but also the negative ones .",
    "our motivation for keeping lower negative degrees of f comes from the fact that in typical solvable systems like the korteweg de vries the related spectral problem allows similar extensions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these lower equations may arise @xcite as a necessary part of an extended symmetry structure @xcite while it is known @xcite that the underlying commutator generates the whole set of symmetry operators for the system .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the biquadratic integral @xcite emerging from the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) facilitates expressing the travelling wave solutions in terms of the jacobian elliptic functions @xmath18 , where the symbol pq represents twelve such distinct functions sn , cn , dn , ns(@xmath19sn),cs(@xmath20 cn / sn ) etc .",
    "the novelty of the eef method is that it opens up a broad spectra of new travelling wave solutions that include the already known ones ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall explicitly provide the solutions generated from the eef method for some special selections of the integral parameters .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ classical ] , we derive the reduced ordinary differential equation for the gsww equation and then go for the classical technique to obtain exact analytical solutions .",
    "in section  [ new - method ] we turn to the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) to take up the construction of our new procedure and then categorise different types of solutions being generated from the eef method by appealing to particular choices of the integral parameters .",
    "it will be seen that the solutions in the appropriate limits reduce to previously known results .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we present a summary of our results .",
    "to start with , we substitute the form ( [ travelling - wave ] ) into the gsww equation ( [ gsww ] ) that results in a fourth order ordinary differential equation @xmath21 let us note that the parameters @xmath22 controls the strength of non - linearity of above equation . without loss of generality , one can leave one of them , say @xmath23 , arbitrary while the other parameter @xmath24 may be varied to tune the strength of non - linearity appropriate for the concerned physical situations .",
    "three particular values of @xmath24 namely @xmath25 are known to correspond completely integrable system . in this article",
    "we shall explore the solutions of equation  ( [ gsww ] ) leaving both of them arbitrary except for @xmath26 as it points to the linear system and hence is well - known .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain a second integral of ( [ ode ] ) given by @xmath27 which may be expressed as a first order equation in terms of the variable @xmath28 : @xmath29 note that in equation  ( [ 2nd - integral ] ) and also elsewhere in the text , the arbitrary constants appearing through the process of integration are denoted by the symbol @xmath30 and will not be explicitly mentioned further . in ( [",
    "1st - order ] ) the monic cubic polynomial @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 for simplicity let us assume that all the three roots of @xmath31 are real and focus on the arrangement @xmath33 .",
    "we consider first the non - degenerate case of distinct roots for @xmath34 . a formal integration of ( [ 1st - order ] ) in the range @xmath35 $ ] , where the point @xmath36 is to be determined from the transcendental equation @xmath37 , yields @xmath38^{1/2}}\\ , .\\ ] ]",
    "now care is to be taken to choose the root @xmath39 that defines the interval of validity of the solution .",
    "it is easy to see that the reality condition for @xmath40 gives rise to two different cases namely either @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "we address them by turn below .",

    "we have thus obtained several new solutions by applying the classical technique based on an analysis of the zeros of a cubic polynomial .",
    "interestingly in the appropriate limits all the known solutions are retrieved .",
    "it is clear that for practical applications of the solutions @xmath54 derived in this section , a knowledge about the position of zeros of @xmath96 is required which somewhat weakens their utility . in the next section",
    "we propose a new method that is free from such a limitation .",
    "here instead of focussing on the zeros of @xmath96 which are unknown we fix the zeros of @xmath10 . since @xmath97 has three zeros [ see equation  ( [ 1st - order ] ) of sec .",

    "note that the inclusion of negative powers of @xmath14 , in general , creates pole of @xmath98 triggering the presence of singular solutions in some situations .",
