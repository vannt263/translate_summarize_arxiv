    "what are the fundamental and not controversial facts characterizing gamma ray bursts ?",
    "i propose a list of seven  pillars \" of knowledge , selected in an admittedly completely subjective way , following this criterion : if we did not know this particular fact , would we lose a basic piece of knowledge ?",
    "one of the major achievements of the _ beppo_sax satellite was to localize a grb with enough accuracy to make the pointing of an optical telescope possible , allowing to find the redshift . at the same time , the afterglow was discovered ( costa et al .",
    "1997 , for grb 970228 ) . as we know",
    ", the first measured redshift was @xmath1 for grb 970508 ( metzeger et al .",
    "1997 ; the redshift for grb 970228 was measured later , due to the faintness of its host galaxy ) .",
    "this ended a long and animated discussion about the origin of grbs ( i.e.  local \" , i.e. associated to neutron stars in the galactic halo , or cosmological , as predicted by paczynski 1986 ) , and finally set the power of these objects : they are indeed the most explosive events of the universe after the big bang .",
    "soft @xmath2ray repeaters , instead , were found to be  nearby \" magnetars undergoing flares , and associated to supernova remnants .",
    "one of the early successes of the _ swift _ satellite was to localize short grbs , and therefore allow the optical follow up leading to establish that they , also , are cosmological events ( gehrels et al . 2005 ) .    the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] reports the energetics of the grbs with measured redshifts , and the bottom panel shows the redshift distribution for long and short grbs .",
    "most of them have been detected by _",
    "swift_. with the caveat that the shown isotropic energetics @xmath3 are not bolometric ones , nor have been k  corrected , we can see that the largest @xmath3 correspond to more than a solar mass entirely converted into energy .",
    "short grbs with measured @xmath4 are still very few , but they seem to lie closer and to be less energetic than long ones .",
    ", so they are only lower limits to the bolometric @xmath3 .",
    "right : redshift distribution .",
    ", width=576,height=384 ]      grbs are the fastest extended objects of nature , with bulk lorentz factors @xmath5 that can exceed 1000 .",
    "the first evidence came from theory : injecting a colossal amount of energy in a small volume ( of the order of a few  radii of size ) leads inevitably to the formation of electron  positron pairs that makes the so  called  fireball \" opaque to the huge internal pressure .",
    "the fireball is then obliged to expand , becoming relativistic with @xmath6 until the internal energy is converted into bulk motion ( if the fireball remains opaque ) .",
    "a nice observational evidence of relativistic speeds came , in the late 90s , from the behavior of the radio afterglow of a few grbs , whose light curve varied wildly for @xmath03 weeks ,  calming down \" after this time .",
    "this behavior was immediately interpreted as due to radio scintillation quenched by the increasing size of the radio source .",
    "therefore it was possible to establish the expansion velocity , that turned out to be superluminal , requiring @xmath7 after 3 weeks from the trigger ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ) .    a very recent evidence came instead from the detection of grbs in the gev energy range by the lat instrument onboard the _ fermi _ satellite .",
    "the gev flux partly overlaps with the emission at lower energies detected by the other _ fermi _ instrument ( the gbm , sensitive in the 8 kev30 mev range ) .",
    "if the two emissions are cospatial , then the variability shown in the gbm dictates that the source must have a minimum @xmath5factor , to avoid @xmath2@xmath8 suppression of high energy photons .",
    "for these lat  detected grbs ( 10% of the total ) , the minimum @xmath5values are around 1000 .",
    "( abdo et al . 2009 ; ackermann et al . 2010 ) .",
    "if , instead , the gev emission is not cospatial with the gbm one , then it is very likely that it belongs to the afterglow phase . the short delay between the gbm and lat emission can be due to the required time for the onset of the afterglow ( i.e. the deceleration time of the fireball moving in the circumburst medium ) .",
    "the shorter this time , the higher the @xmath5factor . again , for all the lat detected bursts , values around 1000 are derived ( ghirlanda , ghisellini & nava 2010 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the grb emission has two phases , the erratic , @xmath2ray ( or hard x  ray ) _ prompt phase _ , and a smoother _ afterglow _ phase .",
    "this means that not all the energy of the fireball is radiated away during the prompt , but some remains .",
    "this was predicted before the first observations of the afterglow , but probably at the same time of the detection of long duration gev emission by the egret instrument onboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ satellite ( meszaros , rees & papathanassiuou 1994 ) and then elaborated by meszaros & rees ( 1997 ) ; vietri ( 1997 ) ; sari & piran ( 1997 ) .",
    "the fact that there are two emission phases suggests that there must be two mechanisms at work , one for the prompt and one for the afterglow .",
    "the duration of the prompt emission of grbs is bimodal , with a minimum around 2 seconds . in astrophysics",
    "bimodal distributions are always looked at with suspicion , since malicious selection effects can be at work .",
    "the convincing arguments of a real bimodality comes from the spectrum since short grbs are harder than long ones .",
    "this was first evident from the hardness ratio ( i.e. the ratio of the flux in two energy bands ; kouveliotu et al .",
    "1993 ) and then substantiated by direct spectral analysis ( ghirlanda , ghisellini & celotti 2004 ) .",
    "the bimodality suggests that grbs come in two flavors , in turn suggesting two different operating mechanisms , and possibly two kinds of progenitors .",
    "the prevalent idea is that long grbs originate immediately after the collapse of a massive , wolf ",
    "rayet star , while short grbs originate from the merging of two compact objects .",
    "this  pillar \" is not very popular , but it was nevertheless crucial for the development of the current leading scenario of  internal shocks \" ( see below ) explaining the prompt emission .",
    "the evidence is that the light curves of grbs ( both long and short ) often shows spikes of emission , whose duration @xmath9 is on average the same ( ramirez  ruiz & fenimore 2000 ) . in other words",
    ", there is no lengthening of @xmath9 with @xmath10 , the time since the trigger .",
    "emission episodes , on average , should then involve regions of similar sizes , and then probably at the same distance from the central engine .",
    "we believed that long grbs are associated to supernovae ib , c , but not all sn ib , c are associated to grbs ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 estimated a fraction less than 1% ) .",
    "the evidence comes from spectroscopy ( for nearby events ) and re  brightening of the optical light curve ( up to @xmath111 ) .",
    "the association strongly indicates that the progenitor of long grbs is a massive stars , that has lost its hydrogen and helium envelopes .",
    "but there are at least two nearby bursts ( grb 060614 , gal ",
    "yam et al .",
    "2006 , and grb 060505 , ofek et al . 2007 ) where the sn was not found .",
    "if present , it would be at least two orders of magnitude less luminous than sn1998bw ( associated to grb 980425 ) .",
    " when you see a grb , you see just one grb \" was a popular motto in the past , meaning that all grbs were different , with no common behaviors .",
    "now this is not true any longer , and there are indeed common trends and similarities .",
    "just two examples : the spectral energy relation , linking @xmath12 to the prompt energetics or peak luminosity , and the typical behavior of the early ( i.e. less than a day or so ) x  ray afterglow , with its characteristic  steep  flat  steep \" light curve ( tagliaferri et al . 2005 ) , and superimposed on that , @xmath01/3 of grbs show x  ray flares ( burrows et al .",
    "these similarities are the starting point for any serious and general modelling : ideas are in fact abundant , but with no clear prevalence of one over the others .",
    "the prevalent idea is that long grbs are caused by the collapse of a wolf ",
    "rayet star leading to the formation of a black hole of a few solar masses rapidly spinning .",
    "this black hole accretes 0.11 @xmath13 from a dense surrounding torus for a time more or less equal to the duration of the prompt emission .",
    "there are several energy reservoirs : neutrinos , the gravitational energy of the infalling matter , and the rotational energy of the newly formed black hole .",
    "the latter is the greatest , since it amounts to @xmath14 .",
    "the problem is how to extract it efficiently .",
    "the leading idea it to use the blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) process , for which a super  critical magnetic field of @xmath15 g is required . for short grbs ,",
    "the merging scenario assumes two compact objects ( e.g. two neutron stars ) forming a @xmath16 black hole surrounded again by a dense accreting torus .",
    "the central engine can then be the same for long and short bursts .",
    "although prevalent , this is not the only idea . instead of a black hole , one could have , at least initially , a neutron star , ( that collapses into a black hole only later , as a re  edition of the vietri & stella ( 1998 ) supranova model ) .",
    "this has been proposed both to explain precursors ( wang & meszaros 2007 , see burlon et al .",
    "2008 for the characterization of precursors ) .",
    "a magnetar has been proposed to explain the flat ( plateaux ) phase of the early x  ray afterglow ( e.g. lyons et al .",
    "an even more radical idea was put forward by paczynski & haensel ( 2005 ) , who suggested a quark star as the central engine .",
    "these authors pointed out that the surface of such a star acts as a one  way membrane , since baryons can only enter , but not escape .",
    "leptons and magnetic fields , instead , can escape .",
    "this would help to explain the paucity of baryons in the fireball ( i.e. the baryon  loading \" problem ) .      in the most popular scenario a huge amount of energy",
    "is injected into a small volume . due to the colossal internal energy ( and the inevitable creation of @xmath17 pairs , making the fireball opaque to radiation ) the fireball is bound to accelerate with @xmath6 . at the same time the comoving temperature ( @xmath18 ) decreases , and when it goes below @xmath020 kev almost all the pairs annihilate without being re  created .",
    "still , a small amount of protons and their accompanying electrons ensures that the fireball continues to be opaque until the internal energy is entirely converted into bulk motion .",
    "thus we need another mechanism to re  convert the bulk energy into radiation .",
    "this is provided by collisions of different parts of the outflowing relativistic wind moving with different @xmath5factors .",
    "this are the so  called  internal shocks \" , occurring at @xmath19@xmath20 cm , where the fireball has turned transparent ( for thomson scatterings ) .",
    "then we have a disorder @xmath21 order @xmath21 disorder process .",
    "lyutikov & blandford ( 2003 ; see the review by lyutikov 2006 and references therein ) advocated instead a simpler order @xmath21 disorder process : the acceleration is due to a dominating magnetic field , allowing for almost matter free fireballs .",
    "one clear test to distinguish is the so  called  optical flash \" , occurring when the fireball starts to be decelerated by the interstellar medium : if it is matter dominated , then a reverse shock develops , that originates an important , and fastly decreasing , emission component ( predicted in the optical or in the ir ) , that would be absent in magnetically dominated fireballs .",
    "indeed optical flashes have been seen , but in a very small fraction of bursts , so the issue is unsettled .",
    "another diagnostic would be polarization of the prompt emission ( see the review by lazzati 2006 ) , that awaits for hard x  rays polarimeters and observations .",
    "collisions between different parts of the relativistic wind ( rees & meszaros 1994 ) leading to  internal \" dissipation is the leading idea for the dissipation mechanism for the prompt emission .",
    "what can be dissipated is only the _ relative kinetic energy _ of the two colliding parts or shells .",
    "the process has then a  built in \" low efficiency ( e.g. lazzati et al . 1999 ) .",
    "consider also that , as a result of the dissipation , we distribute the available energy to protons , magnetic fields and leptons . only the energy given to the latter can be efficiently transformed into radiation .",
    "after the different parts of the fireball have collided and  merged \" , the fireball runs into the circumburst medium , originating a forward  external \" shock .",
    "this collision is with not  moving material , and should be much more efficient , since the entire kinetic energy of the fireball can be used .",
    "the foreseen densities and energies ensure that leptons initially radiatively cool rapidly ( fast cooling regime ) .",
    "thus , at least initially , the resulting afterglow is an efficient radiator .",
    "the energy radiated by the afterglow should then be greater than the energy radiated during the prompt phase .",
    "we observe just the opposite ( e.g. willingale et al . 2007 ) : @xmath22 .",
    "the popular choice is that it is synchrotron emission .",
    "shocks should indeed accelerate electrons to relativistic energies , and amplify magnetic fields , making the synchrotron option a natural one .",
    "on the other hand , we also require any emission process to be efficient , making the electron to cool completely in a timescale much shorter than any conceivable dynamical or integration time .",
    "the spectrum produced by a cooling electron population can not be harder than @xmath23 .",
    "the spectra of practically all bursts are harder than that , and a minority are even flatter than @xmath24 , the low frequency tail of the spectrum produced by a non cooling electron population ( preece et al .",
    "1998 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "continuous re  acceleration or heating of the electrons is not compatible with the idea of internal shocks ( in which each electron is energized only once ) , and other possible  way  outs \" ( adiabatic expansion , steep gradients of the magnetic field , contribution from synchrotron self ",
    "compton ) face severe problems as well .",
    "alternatives have been proposed [ such as jitter radiation ( medvedev 2000 ) ; quasi thermal comptonization ( ghisellini & celotti 1999 ; giannios 2008 ) ; bulk compton ( lazzati et al . 2000 ) ; multicolor blackbody ( peer & ryde 2010 ) ; effects of compton cooling in the klein nishina limit ( daigne et al .",
    "2010 ) ] , but there is no prevalent idea yet .",
    "the time integrated spectrum of the prompt , in @xmath25 , has a well defined peak at @xmath12 , that correlates with the isotropic energy of the prompt @xmath3 : @xmath26 ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) . when it is possible to measure the jet opening angle of the jet , it is possible to estimate the collimated energy @xmath27 , that correlates more tightly with @xmath12 ( @xmath28 , with @xmath29 for an homogeneous circumburst density and @xmath30 for a wind - like profile ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004 ; nava et al .",
    "this correlation is tight enough to allow to  standardize \" gbrs for their use as standard candles to constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "the physical reality of these correlations has been hotly disputed ( see ghirlanda , these proceedings , and reference therein ) , because selection effects could play a role .",
    "on the other hand , the observations of the same correlations _ within single grbs _",
    "( firmani et al . 2009 ; ghirlanda et al . 2010 ) proves that a physical robust mechanism , still to be understood , is responsible for these spectral  flux ( or spectral  energy ) correlations .",
    "the time is in the rest frame of the sources .",
    "the grey stripe indicates a @xmath31 slope .",
    "the flattening at long times for grb 090510 and grb 080916c indicates the level of the background .",
    "note the similarity of the different light curves .",
    ", width=432,height=403 ]",
    "egret , in the 90s , detected a handful of grbs above 100 mev , and since then we have been left with the question : does this emission belong to the prompt phase or is it afterglow emission produced by the fireball colliding with the circum ",
    "burst medium ? or has it still another origin ?",
    "a puzzling feature of the egret high energy emission was that it was long lasting , yet it started during the prompt phase as seen by batse .",
    "_ fermi_/lat is @xmath32 times more sensitive , and indeed it detected a dozen grbs just in its first year of life .      from the analysis of the first 12 grbs detected by the lat we have found these properties ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ) :    0.1 cm * time delay  * usually , the lat emission lags the emission detected by the gbm ( from fractions of seconds , especially for short bursts , to a few seconds ) .",
    "0.1 cm * long lasting  * as already shown by the first egret detections , the emission seen by the lat lasts for a longer time than the emission in the gbm .",
    "0.1 cm * no spectral evolution  * the average , time integrated lat photon index is close to 2 , with no evidence of strong spectral evolution .    0.1 cm * lat and gbm spectral slopes are often different  * the gbm data can be fitted with a band function , composed of two smoothly joining power laws .",
    "all but two bursts ( grb 080916c and grb 090926 ) have lat slopes intermediate between the two slopes of the gbm fit .    0.1 cm * lat fluences are smaller than gbm ones ",
    "* the majority of bursts have lat fluences smaller than the gbm ones .",
    "the two short bursts grb 081024b and grb 090510 and grb 090902b have comparable lat and gbm fluences .",
    "0.1 cm * common decay  * fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the light curves of the 4 brightest grbs with redshift , once the 0.1100 gev luminosity is divided by the energetics @xmath33 of the flux detected by the gbm .",
    "the shaded stripe with slope @xmath31 is shown for comparison .",
    "these four grbs are all consistent , within the errors , with the same decay , both in slope and in normalisation .",
    "note that grb 090510 , a short burst , behaves similarly to the other 3 bursts , that belong to the long class , but its light  curve begins much earlier .",
    "0.2 cm the above properties are just what expected by the afterglow emission due to an external shock .",
    "the short lat ",
    "gbm delay can be caused by a large @xmath5 ( close to 1000 ) , making the fireball to decelerate at early observed times .",
    "_ the earlier the onset of the afterglow , the brighter the afterglow at early times : _ this explains why only 10% of grbs have been detected by the lat : they correspond to bursts having the largest @xmath5factors .",
    "the relatively steep decay of the lat light curves is very close to what expected if the fireball is radiative ( i.e. most of the dissipated energy is radiated ) . in this case",
    "the bolometric flux in fast cooling decays as @xmath34 ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ; ghisellini et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the slopes of the lat spectra , being close to unity ( in energy ) , are indeed a good proxy for the bolometric fluxes .",
    "the large peak energy of the gbm flux suggests that electron  positron pairs might play a crucial role for the setting of the radiative regime : a tiny fraction of the prompt photons , scattered ( i.e.  decollimated \" ) by the circumburst electrons , are immediately converted into pairs by the high energy photons of the prompt , largely increasing the lepton to proton ratio ( beloborodov 2002 ) .",
    "when the shock comes , the dissipated energy can then be given mostly to leptons rather than to protons , and this makes the fireball radiative .",
    "note a key ingredient of this scenario : to produce pairs efficiently , the prompt emission should have a sufficient number of photons above threshold , i.e. above 511 kev .",
    "the increase of knowledge can be represented as the volume of an expanding sphere , so it goes like @xmath35 , the cube of the radius .",
    "the surface of the sphere is the at the frontier with the unknown , the unexplained , and usually goes like @xmath36 . but for grbs it seems that that surface is a fractal , whose dimensionality is greater than 2 ... is it good or bad ? it may be perceived as depressing at first , after all these years of hectic studies , but at a second sight it should be taken as a good opportunity , especially for the younger scientists : there is still something really fundamental to be found out .",
